Champlin bravely asserts his own contribution to the great wealth of Neronian scholarship for the critics to pick apart. I find very little to quibble about.<br />It is difficult to write even-handedly about Nero for a Western audience. Who could forget the image of a man who \\"fiddled while Rome burned\\" or the terrible tyrant who had begun a nearly 170 year \\"persecution\\" of the early Christians, under whose reign both Peter and Paul were executed? As other reviewer comments reveal, you can easily earn the brand of a Nero \\"apologist\\" if you don't tow the party line, however inaccurate it might be.<br /><br />Champlin's thesis can be stated simply as follows: many, if not most of Nero's grandstands and outrageous actions, were performed out of considerable political shrewdness and calculation - not the madness or puerile excess wrongly attributed to a \\"live fast, die young, and leave a good looking corpse\\" emperor. Nero's success, Champlin argues in the first chapter, is evinced by a shockingly prolonged \\"afterlife\\" manifested in pseudo-Neros, Judeo-Christian apocalyptic writings, and a disenfranchised populace openly lamenting his death. Nonetheless, I cannot help but wonder, (working on the same assumption,) whether he had truly orchestrated his public relations as well as Champlin suggests given his untimely demise at age 30.<br /><br />Some reviewers disagree, but I reckon Champlin's original Nero-Periander link to be one of the most intriguing ideas in ancient biography I've ever seen. The ambivalent relationship with the mother, the Philhellenism, the artistic bent, and the numerous other links are too compelling to ignore outright, even if the conclusion a hard sell. Further research is warranted, but I suspect that Champlin, with his great intellect and energy, may have already exhausted all of the available evidence for advancing his thesis. He demonstrates the Augustus/Antony connections thoroughly. The discussion of the great fire of 64 is arrestingly well done: after convincingly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration. It hits you with dramatic effect almost equal to one of the primary sources comprising the centerpiece of his proof in this sudden reversal: Tacitus' Annales XV.67.<br /><br />Champlin's organization is somewhat bothersome as it is in \\"Final Judgments,\\" because he rejects chronological arrangement for thematic foci. This requires repetition of several facts, and I cannot understand his reasons for the chapter order. The post-mortem legacy of Nero, being most fascinating, he puts up front obviously to hook his reader. It serves as an interesting set piece for further discourse, because the inevitable wonder we feel about Nero's impression on the world ever after demands explanation: thus the rest of the book. But with Dio, Suetonius, and Tacitus unfolding the bulk of their own histories so methodically, the rearrangement isn't always a neat fit. Still, Champlin's brilliant weaving together of hundreds of sources, as before, vindicates his literary decisions several times over.<br /><br />Champlin, like any other historian, has his hypotheses and directs his evidence toward proving them. His presentation however, is replete with past scholarship and primary sources presented candidly and fairly. One of the most appreciable inclusions is the extensive collection of Latin graffiti, which add a critical dimension to our knowledge. This book has been for me an introduction into full-strength Neronian scholarship and I found it both accessible and empowering enough to read further with confidence.ngly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration.

I had to suspend my contact with reality a little bit, but I truly enjoyed this book on CD.  There was one incredible mistake, however, from Ellie, the supposed art expert.  She made the comment that she could \\"shoot John the Baptist through the eye in the painting of the Last Supper.\\"  As any good art expert (or Roman Catholic) would know, St. John the Baptist was not in Da Vinci's Last Supper; he was executed before Jesus even began his public ministry. <br /> <br />Despite this glaring error, Patterson had many twists and turns that kept me listening to this CD.  Just when I thought I had the whole story figured out, the plot twisted just enough to throw me off.  The ending was somewhat contrived and unbelievable; it also seemed rushed compared to the rest of this novel.  Overall, however, I would recommend it.	2005-10-14

It took me a little while to start to really read 32AA but once I started I couldn't put it down. Emma is a totally identifiable character, I felt for her in the bad situations she was put in. I felt that the author did a fantastic job with the Emma and Adam story-I'm glad she didn't make Emma a character who longs for her ex even though the ex is horrible, which some characters in chick-lit tend to do. I loved the character of Jack and I couldn't wait till the end to see how the story ended. I wasn't dissapointed.Right after I finished reading 32AA, I went to amazon.com and ordered Call waiting, which is the sequel to 32AA. So if you're looking for a light fun book to read-this is the one.	2005-10-12

I gave Passion a re-read, skimming the painful sex scenes, and the romance was just so-so. There was potential but without the heat of the 'love` scenes 'Passion` would not stand out in any way. <br /> <br />I felt no love between the h/h and Passion had a doormat mentality. The language was even too course for me, and I consider myself a jaded erotica/romance reader. LV needs to apply the use of a thesaurus on her next efforts. There are other words for the female genitalia than the \\"c\\" word which was used ad nauseam. <br /> <br />Mark, our hero extraordinaire sums the book up quite well when he and his brother have a particularly stimulating conversation. They have a long standing agreement they shall marry any woman who can 'take` the entirety of their massive male appendages. How romantic!  <br /> <br />For an erotic read hotter than 'Passion` WITH the romance read 'A Lady's Pleasure` by Renee Bernard.	2005-10-12

US	52902520	R11TB1QNAXY5I9	0967608058	338337828	Achilles	Books	2	10	16	N	Y	No myth - No magic	There are few historical novels about the mythic Greek hero, Achilles, perhaps because there are several remarkable translations of Homer's The Iliad, at the center of which is his story. It is hard to match the original, as this pedestrian attempt amply illustrates. Homer tells the story with poetry, drama, passion, and tenderness. Mike Chapman's version, on the other hand, is Christianized drivel which is bland, misleading, and often inaccurate.<br /><br />Mr. Chapman writes satisfactorily and may even love his subject, but he does not respect it. He has removed the vibrancy of Homer's epic by shifting its emphasis. Gone is the mythology of Achilles' lineage: his mother was the nymph, Thetis, daughter of the sea god Nereus. Mr. Chapman, inexplicably, makes Poseidon her father and Thetis a deluded woman who just thinks she is divine.  Gone is the decisive part the gods play in the story, altering it irrevocably.  Their interaction with and influence on the mortals, as well as the demigod Achilles, are integral to Homer's epic poem.  The costly 10-year war between the Greeks and Trojans was both precipitated and prolonged by the bickering gods.<br /><br />If the author's goal was to 'modernize' Homer by inventing 'rational' alternatives to the mythological and supernatural aspects of Homer's epic, he has succeeded only in removing its mystery and power.  Chiron, the wise centaur (half-man half-horse) who tutored Achilles in fighting, music, and the healing arts is merely a remarkable horseman.  No mention is made of Hephaestus, the smith god who forged Achilles' wondrous armor -  a plot point on which rests the fates of Patroclus, Achilles, Hector, and the tide of the war itself. Gone is the quiet magic of King Priam's touching nocturnal pilgrimage, aided by the god Hermes, to plead for Hector's body from angry, inconsolable, noble Achilles.<br /><br />Gone as well is any suggestion that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers. Their sexual relationship is widely recognized, as homosexuality between aristocratic Greek men and boys was a codified part of the society in general and the military in particular.  Here they are good buddies. By choosing to ignore their love, Mr. Chapman has eliminated the reason for Achilles' terrible grief and rage. Patroclus' ghost bade his beloved companion, \\"Just as we grew up together in our youth, so let our bones rest side by side and our ashes be mingled in the same urn.\\"  They were buried side by side and, centuries later, their graves were honored by two other great lovers of the ancient world, Alexander the Great and Hephaistion.<br /><br />I suspect Mr. Chapman fig-leafed Achilles' potent story to make it more `palatable' to modern (i.e., Christian) tastes and sensibilities. What he has wrought is an unimaginative war story, without magic or myth, which deeply diminishes Homer and his brilliant subject.ly recognized, as homosexuality between aristocratic Greek men and boys was a codified part of the society in general and the military in particular.

Hannibal is quite possibly the strongest, most engaging title in the Hannibal Lector series to date.  In it we finally get a true glimpse into the mind of this disturbing and yet intrigueing individual.  You find yourself disgusted by and yet cheering for him through much of the book, a feeling that be every bit as disturbing as his actions themselves.  Clarice Starling also makes a comeback and reafirms Harris' talent for writing strong, effective female protagonists.  This book is insanely engaging (I read the whole thing in just a little over a day) and I highly recommend it.	2005-10-12

It is right up Sterling's alley-the individual against the state, and his right to revolt.<br /><br />Of course this book has elements of other dystopian literature:  big government and small humans, retrograde technology, and state control of life, liberty, and sex.  This seems like a rehash of the usual works (\\"The Iron Heel,\\" \\"THX-1138,\\" \\"Logan's Run, \\" \\"Harrison Bergeron\\"), but keep in mind it was written in 1937, five years AFTER \\"Brave New World,\\" and  eleven years BEFORE \\"1984.\\"<br /><br />In fact, this book in many ways surpasses Orwell's classic.  Being a novella, it is crisper, punchier, and more to the point. It has less deadwood (the sex scene are allusions), and focuses on the moral aspects of an omnipresent state that has eliminated the word \\"We.\\"<br /><br />That is the key. Eleven years before Appleforth refused to eliminate the word \\"God,\\" the World Council had eliminated the word \\"I.\\"  For day to day activity, that is like removing the letter \\"e.\\"  Throughout the narrative, which is written in first person, Equality 7-2521  keeps referring to himself as \\"we.\\"<br /><br />This makes for awkward reading, since we do not know if he is along or with Liberty 5-3000, or anyone else. But that is point: the objective of the World Council is to eliminate the concept of individuality in order to cement control over society.<br /><br />You do not need a whole Newspeak dictionary if you can eliminate this one word for the vocabulary. This one small change makes all the difference.<br /><br />*<br /><br />The only drawback is that Peikoff included the galley prints of Rand's revision of the First Edition. This uselessly doubles the size of the book, but it is an important insight for fans of Rand and those who are aspiring writers.  If you liked \\"Romantic Manifesto\\" and \\"The Art of Fiction,\\" buy this book. You see Rand's mind in action.	2005-10-12

Tosches had the makings of a terrific thriller. But the central character and plot are unbelievable.   <br />  The book starts with Johnny DiPietro, nephew of an old Mafia don, fulfilling a contract for his uncle. He drives, his buddy does the shooting. To Johnny, the victim is not a person, but Johnny's \\"new transmission\\" for his car. He's a slimeball, and thus far rendered believable, ala Elmore Leonard. There is a reference that, as a youth, he had a thirst for knowledge, and that he had at one time read good books. Aside from this, Johnny gives no sense of authority, high intelligence, or competency. Then his uncle, who wants to take over the world's heroin market, decides to use Johnny as his representative in the biggest (and least plausible ) dope deal in the history of crime fiction. Suddenly Johnny, who's making twenty-five grand a year in a union job, is transformed into a wizard with the ability to: <br /> 1- Negotiate a billion dollar drug deal with a stereotyped crafty, unfathomable Chinese Triad boss <br /> 2- Has a tremendous facility with numbers <br /> 3- Is knowledgeable about international banking, finance, the Asian drug market, crops, weapons systems, customs brokerage, and much much much more ( he can do no wrong, make no false step ) <br /> 4- Is conversant with, and actively thinks about, Dante, Socrates ( whom he criticizes as arrogant for his admonition to \\"Know thyself\\", since knowing oneself is impossible), and Milton's Paradise Lost. <br />  There is no sense of irony to tell us this is all meant as parody. Rather, Toshces presents this in a serious tone, with a lot of \\"deep\\" perception from the previously thuggish Johnny, that alerts the reader to the fact that Johnny is really Tosches' representative more than his uncle's; it is the author's concerns put into Johnny's mind, and as such they become, especiallyin the penultimate chapter, more pretentious than they would have if we had been given a realistic character who was fully developed. Johnny loses all credibility, as does the preposterous plot.  <br />   Tosches is very talented. He has done abundant research. With the Chinese Triads he had a good subject that wasn't written to death. But all this was lost under the creaky, potboiler plot and the unbelievable Johnny.  <br />   Johnny tells us there is no good or evil, but tries to convince us he's a nice guy anyway. To rationalize shipping billions of dollars of heroin into New York, he says the drug addicts deserve it. \\"If the scum of humanity craved heroin, so be it. Let the self-oppressors go down together, down to the wasteland of gutted souls and assembly-line minds.\\" And he calls Socrates arrogant?	2005-10-12

US	44731853	R27OU9QI1HB456	B0007LQ4GQ	559514085	Flashpoint	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	I could not stop reading!	Jimmy Nash and Tess Bailey are together again.  Well sort of.  Several months ago, Tess, a computer analyst, helped Nash save his best friend and colleague Decker from a potential hit.  With the adrenaline running high and eyes wide open, Nash and Tess had a one night stand after all was said and done.  Now, they are part of a team sent to Kazbekistan to help recover a laptop with enough information that could put a major dent in the fight against terrorism.  Can these two work together or will their attraction get them killed?<br /><br />Flashpoint is a fast paced, edge of your seat thriller set in Kazbekistan.  Nash is a bad ass agent who plays hard and works harder.  His nonchalant attitude has gotten him in trouble more than once.  In the case of Tess, his best friend Decker has some feelings for her that Nash either fails to realize or can't resist.  It's an interesting subplot of two friends attracted to the same woman.  At first, I didn't know who I wanted to root for, but as the plot thickened Nash seemed to be the better choice despite his dark side.  He has enough personal issues to fill a book, but with Tess he shows a softer edge.  He begins to care about her as a person rather than a potential lay or fellow agent.  The moments of tenderness he shows made me realize he is a good man.  He just doesn't know how to express himself.  He has been an agent for so long that I don't think he knows how to be anything else.  It's like he doesn't know where his life as an agent ends and he, as a person, begins.<br /><br />Tess is an awesome computer analyst, but a green field agent.  On her first assignment, she is out of her element.  In Kazbekistan, she sees the worst that reality has to offer but still remains upbeat.  Her optimism was a breath of fresh air even in the darkest times.  I admired her stubbornness and love for Nash because she could see the person he could be under all of the arrogance and attitude.  Yet she would not ask for more than what he could offer.  She would not beg him to love her.  It was all or nothing for her.<br /><br />Flashpoint is my first Suzanne Brockmann book, but definitely not my last.  The characters are richly detailed and flawed.  Tess, Nash and the secondary characters are real.  Under the harshest conditions, they do and see things that would make a normal person cringe.  I was riveted by the story and all of the subplots that were seamlessly interwoven throughout the book.  Each one helped drive the story, not diminishing the overall storyline.  I could not stop reading because I needed to know what happened next.  I hope each of the secondary characters will have their own story because they are so fascinating.  Flashpoint is a wonderful thriller that will keep you riveted until the last page.<br /><br />Lee<br /><br />Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewedhat he could offer.  She would not beg him to love her.

The author - and translator -  have managed a perfect journey, not very pretty, into the world of a South African version of poor white trash. The characters' lives are like the town they live in - built on destruction with God know what lying rotting under the surface.   As I read I was almost desperate to find something, anything, to like about the characters.  The few moments when that happened were rain in the desert.
