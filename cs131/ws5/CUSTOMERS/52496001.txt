It means \\"a person possessed of a passion for magic and wonders\\". This book is for those special, patient thaumatomanes who are bibliophiles with a refined sense of humor and who like to linger and savor the descriptive, literary alchemy in Clarke's prose, even when magic isn't the immediate topic at hand... and don't mind an occasional wandering into sub-stories. Many reviews have already given the general storyline, so I won't repeat that here. What I will focus on is the unusual, mysterious nature of the magic that Clarke portrays. When she was asked whether she believed magic really exists, she said: \\"The answer would have to be no. The magic in Strange & Norrell is purely literary. It's not based on the work of actual magicians of the time. (I read a book about eighteenth/nineteenth-century occult scholarship recently; it was very dull and rather hard to follow.).\\"  Although it is true that the magic is only literary, there are short references to real historical figures who are implied to be magicians.  For example, in a footnote on consulting dead magicians as a magical procedure, the Raven King supposedly had conversations with Merlin, the Witch of Endor, Moses and Aaron, Joseph of Arimathea and \\"other venerable and ancient magicians\\".  Also, reference is made in a couple places to Valentine Greatrakes who, in reality, was an Irish healer who toured England in 1666 and cured people by the laying on of hands.  Aside from these references, genuine historical figures such as Wellington, Napoleon, and Lord Byron play more notable, non-magical roles.<br /><br />In addition to the genuine historical figures that make an appearance, a genuine occult item does as well: the Marseilles Tarot deck. Childermass, steward to Norrell, owns a crude, self-created version of one that he occasionally uses for \\"fortune telling\\" to the dislike of Norrell who, strangely, despises them and actually believes that the future cannot be predicted. In fact, what Norrell has in common with theoretical magicians such as Segundus and Honeyfoot is the lack of belief in prophecies which they associate with charlatans. Yet, interestingly, both Norrell and Strange are essential parts of a prophecy (and spell!) of the Raven King, the founder of English magic! What makes the story even more interesting as well as comical is that Vinculus, a street \\"sorcerer\\" and charlatan who is despised by Norrell, apparently has the only magical book written by the Raven King and can quote the King's prophecies by heart. Significantly, it is Vinculus who plays the crucial yet seemingly haphazard role of introducing Jonathan Strange to magic as a profession.<br /><br />The magic in the novel is mysteriously, fantastically, even humorously portrayed (For example, in 1138, the Raven King himself is reputed to have caused the moon to disappear from the sky and travel through all the lakes and rivers of England. Hmmm... how big did they think the moon was back then? Perhaps some of the magic was illusory, like our modern-day legerdemain, but who knows.) Relocating landscapes (including buildings, towns, troops, etc.) is learned more quickly than other feats which some may think should be easier. Fairies (feet tall, not inches) have an influential, magical role. According to Richard Chaston (1620 - 95; yes, he's fictional), \\"men and fairies both contain within them a faculty of reason and a faculty of magic. In men reason is strong and magic is weak. With fairies it is the other way round: magic comes very naturally to them, but by human standards they are barely sane.\\" This footnote occurs in Chapter 25, over 200 pages into the novel. It partially explains why Strange later tries to use madness to contact a fairy. The influential role fairies play is seen in the fact that the Englishman John Uskglass (later known as \\"The Raven King\\") learned magic from fairies after he was stolen as a child and taken to Faerie (a.k.a. \\"The Other Lands\\" by magicians) where he eventually became a powerful leader. According to Strange, the Raven King is the most mysterious of the Mediaeval AUREATE (Golden Age) magicians. He came out of Faerie to establish his kingdom of Northern England some time ago, then several centuries later he \\"departed\\" (Norrell says \\"abandoned\\") England in 1434, going who-knows-where and leaving the influence and practice of English magic in decline.<br /><br />Scattered throughout the book, especially in the footnotes, are details regarding the Raven King and magicians/magic in general. One learns that magicians only applied themselves to writing books when magic was already in decline (the AUREATE magicians learned their magic experientially and with the help of fairies, not books). The AUREATE magicians included, along with the Raven King, Thomas Godbless, Ralph Stokesey, and Catherine of Winchester. Martin Pale (1485 - 1567) was the last of the AUREATES and he was tutored by Catherine of Winchester, a student of the Raven King, 200 years AFTER her death. Next in practical magic's decline came the ARGENTINE (Silver Age) magicians who were scholars first, magicians second. Some of the names given for these include Thomas Lanchester (1518 - 90), Jacques Belasis (1526 - 1604), Nicholas Goubert (1535 - 78), and Gregory Absalom (1507 - 99). When exactly practical magic left England isn't entirely clear, although the first thing a student of magic learns is that there are books OF magic, written before magic ended in England, and books ABOUT magic, written later. Norrell's 19th century claim-to-fame was that he's a genuine practical magician, not a theoretical one like every other so-called magician of his time. It is he who hoards all the books OF magic which forces Strange to learn practical magic primarily the way the AUREATES did: through experience. In fact, before Norrell decides to accept Strange as an apprentice, he is fascinated by a magical act performed by Strange who isn't entirely sure how he did it!<br /><br />The book implies that the greatest magic (used by the Raven King and some if not all of the other AUREATES) is innovative and rooted in a type of nature mysticism where natural objects like trees, stones, water, sky and even birds (incl. ravens, of course) can speak and be spoken to as spirits in a mystical way to form alliances, something that the rationalistic and book-dependent Norrell calls \\"mystical nonsense\\".  Norrell can do some startling things, but how much of his magic is really based on his own innovations and alliances rather than those of others via books?  \\"Shape-changing\\" is also mentioned as something generally employed by the AUREATES during their travels in Faerie or other lands beyond England, but it isn't given prominence in the book.  It is said, however, that the AUREATES were aware of its liability to abuses.<br /><br />Norrell, unlike Strange, has animosity towards the Raven King, partially because he failed to magically make contact with him in his early years. Also, he doesn't like the idea of depending on fairies or the King to do magic, although he depends on magical books and secretly summons a fairy via a book (which becomes a nuisance to others throughout the remainder of the novel) to raise Lady Pole from the dead so he can make a name for himself as the one who will restore practical magic to England.<br /><br />Clarke has revealed some of the literary magicians that inspired her own. Included are the magicians in C. S. Lewis's Narnia stories, although she says her closest model was Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea stories. She liked the idea of a magician with no name such as Earthsea's magician: \\"the Grey Mage of Paln, whose magic was so dubious, his name was forgotten\\" and the magician in The Lord of the Rings, \\"right at the very end, who comes out of Mordor to do battle against our heros and no one knows hisname because he himself has forgotten it.\\" However, since she wasn't sure what to do with a major character with no name, the Raven King \\"acquired more names than most people\\" such as John Uskglass, The Black King, the King of the North, and the fairy name no one can pronounce.  Although Clarke doesn't mention Edward Bulwer-Lytton's magical English novel Zanoni (published in 1824) as an influence, I wouldn't be surprised if she read it since it involves two different-natured magicians like Norrell and Strange, both with longevity of life like the Raven King. I can see a few very general similarities between it and her novel.<br /><br />A movie of Clarke's magical tome is under production. Unlike Le Guin who didn't have much of a say in how the Earthsea movie turned out, Clarke has a hand in producing her book-based movie. I look forward to it and consider Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell one of my favorite novels.ntice, he is fascinated by a magical act performed by Strange who isn't entirely sure how he did it!

US	52496001	R2O1Z9G9DYC0X7	0736912215	268576986	Witchcraft Goes Mainstream: Uncovering Its Alarming Impact on You and Your Family	Books	4	14	15	N	N	A Useful Reference Work for Neo-pagans and Christians	This book is the best conservative Christian assessment of modern witchcraft on the market to date.  It easily replaces, as a general assessment, Craig Hawkins's earlier book \\"Witchcraft - Exploring the World of Wicca\\" (1996) which, despite its flaws, does discuss areas not focused on by Alexander and is better than some of the newer books on the topic such as Tim Baker's shallow and unscholarly \\"Dewitched\\".  Unlike Hawkins who tried to tie the biblical condemnation of \\"witchcraft\\" to all modern \\"witchcraft\\" practices today and blurred the distinction between witchcraft in general and Wicca in particular and sometimes confused them with Neo-Paganism in general, Alexander is more cautious and balanced.  He shows that there are four main categories of witchcraft that must be distinguished: biblical, anthropological, historical, and modern religious.<br /><br />Regarding biblical witchcraft, he admits that, in some cases, the Hebrew and Greek terms usually translated as \\"witch/witchcraft\\" and/or \\"sorcerer/sorcery\\" don't tell us what specific occult practice is identified so it is difficult to give a single, specific meaning to the term \\"witchcraft\\" as it is used in Scripture.  He says there are eight references to witchcraft in the Bible, seven of which are in the Old Testament.  The exact root of the Hebrew word mekashef is uncertain but is believed to come from a word meaning to cut or cut up, possibly referring to drugs or plants as  sliced and shredded for a \\"magical brew\\".  He notes that the \\"witch of Endor\\" (1 Samuel 28:3-19) was probably a necromancer or spirit medium, and the statement from 1 Samuel, \\"rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft\\" (15:23, KJV), involves the word qesem which, he says, \\"refers to some (unknown) form of divination.\\"  In the New Testament, the Greek word pharmakeia is translated once (in Galatians 5:20) as \\"witchcraft\\" and four times (in the Book of Revelation) as \\"sorcery, sorceries or sorcerers\\".  This word is at the root of the English word \\"pharmacy\\" which, again, seems to involve drugs, potions or poisons.  For Alexander, the biblical bottom line is that the references are \\"hard to apply with precision today because the biblical translators were naming ancient occult practices with terms taken from the theological controversies of their own day - and they weren't always consistent in the way they did it.\\"  That kind of admission from a conservative Christian who is writing about witchcraft is uncommon!<br /><br />Although Alexander discusses anthropological and historical witchcraft, referring to scholars like Jeffrey Burton Russell, his focus is on the two \\"cultures\\" of modern witchcraft: traditional witchcraft as derived from Gerald Gardner's influence and authors such as Michelet, Leland, Murray, and Graves who contributed to what he calls the contra-Christian and pseudo-historic \\"Charter Myth\\" of an ancient, enduring Pagan tradition (which modern scholarship has debunked and some witches acknowledge) and the pop-culture witchcraft that came about from media influence via movies/shows such as The Craft, Practical Magic, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Charmed (for some reason, Alexander doesn't include Harry Potter as a major influence!?).  Although pop-culture witchcraft is a hodge-podge of beliefs and practices, many of which are contrary to traditional witchcraft, it nonetheless motivates some people, especially youth, to seek out information and, possibly, enter into traditional witchcraft beliefs and practices.  According to Alexander, these movies/shows created an explosion of cultural interest in witchcraft, and sympathy for it, that is still growing.  Besides the Charter Myth, Alexander also exposes the myths that Neo-pagan witchcraft is nothing but a New Age delusion or a Satanic cult.<br /><br />There's a mild sense of despair that underlies the book which is fueled by Alexander's admission that Neo-paganism, and its witchcraft, is winning the cultural competition of worldviews.  He refers to James Herrick, author of \\"The Making of the New Spirituality: The Eclipse of the Western Religious Tradition,\\" who says that the \\"New Religious Synthesis\\" is displacing the \\"Revealed Word perspective as the source of values and attitudes for our cultural elite\\" and, according to Alexander, this also applies to the popular level as well in the \\"battle of the narratives\\".  Although for Alexander as a Christian, and for many traditional witches, there can be no mixing of Neo-paganism or witchcraft with Christianity, there are attempts being made.  See, for example, the book \\"Christian Wicca: The Trinitarian Tradition\\" by Nancy Chandler Pittman.  Nonetheless, Alexander does promote understanding, tolerance and dialog between Christians and Neo-pagans, as do some Neo-pagans, without denying the biases on both sides.  This book is a good contribution to that dialog.tition of worldviews.

Unlike Blavatsky's Theosophical Society of the nineteenth century which primarily involved esoteric Buddhism, the earlier theosophy primarily involved esoteric Christianity.  The Christian nature of The Cloud Upon the Sanctuary is clear in the sense that Jesus Christ is given preeminence as the Wisdom of God.  But some Christians may consider the work not \\"Christian\\" enough, historically and doctrinally speaking, whereas others with esoteric interests may consider the work too Christian.  The Christianity it posits is \\"inclusivistic\\" in that all is seen and encompassed in Christ by whom, according to Eckartshausen, \\"all is made, and which existed from the beginning, Jesus Christ, the Wisdom of God working in everything\\".  The \\"cloud\\" of the title relates to the noetic weakness, derived from The Fall of Adam and inherited by us, that veils the truth of our essential nature, our inner sanctuary, as created in the image of God.  Our Divine Center, the Light and Mysteries Within, is the Holy of Holies which is covered by the veil of error, a false nature, which is removed through divine inspiration, illumination, and revelation via meditation.  The removing of the veil, or Cloud, is progressively sanctifying as one moves into the Center (the esoteric) from the circumference (the exoteric).  Those who live within from the Divine Center represent the Interior Church which is invisible and secure.  More could be said, but only the reading of the work itself can give the full effect.  It is a unique work of mystical doctrine that is unforgettable.	2005-05-27

The word is often associated with mysticism and occult magic along with the word \\"thaumaturgy\\" which means wonder working and usually given a naturalistic basis.  However, there's a legitimate and Christian, biblical understanding of theurgy as God's supernatural working in and through individuals which may sometimes result in wonder working (miracles).  I also believe that W. Ian Thomas' two books, The Saving Life of Christ and The Mystery of Godliness, provide the Christian foundations for that understanding.  Although Thomas does not use either of the two terms, he certainly teaches the concepts, laying the groundwork for more in-depth study and exposition.  Within The Saving Life of Christ, he studies Old Testament passages in light of New Testament revelation and focuses on God as the power source of one's salvation not only in the future but here and now on earth through the Christian principle of an exchanged life: \\"...not I, but Christ lives in me\\" (Galatians 2:20).  To be in Christ is redemption that makes one fit for heaven, but for Christ to be in you is sanctification that makes one fit for earth.  One becomes an empowered conduit through which God's will is done on earth as it is in heaven.<br /><br />Those who think of God in spacial terms and their relationship with God in terms of self-willed obedience are missing out on the profound biblical truths that Thomas enthusiastically conveys.  Because of sin in the first Adam, you are dead but because of righteousness in the last Adam (Christ) and his atonement and resurrection on your behalf, your life is hid with Christ in God.  Therefore, be transformed by renewing your mind from a limited, fearful self-consciousness in Adam to a limitless, faithful God-consciousness in Christ and realize that true obedience (that is, true love) is by God's grace, not self-will.  In other words, as one lives in the reality of God's grace through faith, God's will (love) is fulfilled through you because you are dead to self but alive to God through the Holy Spirit of Christ.  God's love now motivates you.  Just as Jesus said that he can do NOTHING of himself without his Father, so also his disciples can do NOTHING of themselves without Christ.  And \\"nothing\\" is not a little bit of something!  Thomas asks, \\"Are you `man-conscious' or `God-conscious'?\\" and shows why the latter overcomes all obstacles.  He also explains what it means in Hebrews that Christ was \\"made perfect\\" through suffering and how we too have a God-given vocation to fulfill.<br /><br />In The Mystery of Godliness, Thomas takes us to higher, deeper levels.  I consider his two chapters, \\"How to Do the Impossible\\" and \\"I Am - Thou Art!\\" to be pure gold.  One is given the profound truth revealed by Jesus that just as with God all things are possible, so also are all things possible to the one who believes, who \\"reckons with Christ\\".  Because of this truth, one is called to sober reflection on one's own unbelief through the scriptural examples of Christ's disciples.  Here's a good quote:  \\"Remember that it is precisely in those areas of your life in which you have not considered Christ to be relevant, in which as yet you have not repented!  In these areas you are still trying to be adequate without Him - trying to be the 'cause' of your own 'effect'; and if you are the cause, there will certainly be nothing miraculous about the effect!\\"<br /><br />If you want to understand the foundations of supernatural living that patiently endures and overcomes suffering and sets you free from the law of sin and death, then there is no better place to begin than with Thomas' two books, although there is more related truth available than he provides.  But I warn you.  In order to live the abundant life that these books expound, you must take up your cross and die to self.  And you must do so daily in order that Christ may abundantly live in and through you.This may be harder than you think.  I myself am still coming to terms with it.  Remember Peter's bold assertion that he would never deny Christ, yet when opposition came, what did he do out of fear?  Be prepared and alert.  Walk humbly and patiently through the Spirit in faith that works by love and then you will see, in due time, God's fullness of joy and peace and healing in and through Christ... that is, in and through you who are in Christ and have Christ in you.than you think.

US	52496001	R2MYZZ3DS4H7EI	0875163238	547705567	It Works: The Famous Little Red Book That Makes Your Dreams Come True!	Books	3	111	130	N	Y	A Simple, Concise New Thought Classic	This little booklet was published in the early twentieth century by an anonymous author referred to only by his initials R.H.J.  The content is clearly within the parameters of \\"New Thought\\" literature.  For those unfamiliar with New Thought Metaphysics, I recommend reading \\"New Thought: A Practical American Spirituality\\" by Anderson & Whitehouse as an introduction.  The booklet is deliberately short for easy understanding and conscious use of the mental, karmic \\"Law\\" of causality (\\"the cause of failure or success\\"), which some authors call the \\"law of attraction\\", that is related to what the author calls your \\"Omnipotent Power\\".  Reference is made to \\"The Law of Psychic Phenomena\\" by Thomson Jay Hudson, an influential nineteenth-century book that is referenced in other New Thought-related books such as Haanel's The Master Key System, Bristol's The Magic of Believing, and Stone & Hill's Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude.  The author uses Mr. Hudson's distinction between the \\"objective mind\\" (which some call the conscious mind, outer mind, or carnal mind, the last from the biblical letters of the Apostle Paul) and the \\"subjective mind\\" (which some call the subconscious mind, the inner mind or, to use biblical terms, the spirit or soul).<br /><br />Contrary to some writers, the author associates the subjective mind with Omnipotent Power which he calls \\"Emmanuel (God in us)\\".  He fails to distinguish, as do some, between one's subconscious mind which is finite and fallible, and the superconscious Mind (or God), located both within and without, which is Infinite and Infallible.  This is an important distinction and is recognized (with various interpretations) even in occult books such as Amber K's True Magick, which also uses the distinguishing terms of Lower Self (the subconscious), Middle Self (the self-conscious), and High or Higher Self (the superconscious).<br /><br />The author states the objective mind (which is tied to outward appearances) is \\"the mind you use every day\\", and this \\"mind and will are so vacillating that you usually only WISH for things and the wonderful, capable power within you does not function\\".  Wishing is associated with half-hearted wanting in contrast to real, persistent and earnest desiring that, if one follows the three positive rules of \\"The Plan\\", produces faith in the subjective mind that guarantees results.  The objective mind also involves the \\"natural and ancient enemy\\" of Discredit which uses doubt that acts as an adversary to faith.  It is this enemy that makes knowing what you REALLY want and training your objective mind \\"no easy task\\".  According to Wattles in his book, The Science of Getting Rich: \\"Every man has the natural and inherent power to think what he wants to think, but it requires far more effort to do so than it does to think the thoughts which are suggested by appearances.  To think according to appearances is easy, to think truth regardless of appearances is laborious, and requires the expenditure of more power than any other work man is called upon to perform.\\" Wattles continues: \\"There is no labor from which most people shrink as they do from that of sustained and consecutive thought, it is the hardest work in the world.  This is especially true when truth is contrary to appearances.\\"  Words to the wise: Beware of being your own worst enemy.  The enemy of doubt is the primary reason why one should not talk to anyone about one's plan which is the third positive rule.  The author fails to explain this, although he does so in his later book (mentioned below).  In the later book he says: \\"The reason is two-fold.  If you have been unsuccessful, most of your listeners will agree with you that the plan is foolish.  If successful and you tell about it, they will doubt you; and unless you have a firm conviction of this truth you may lose the faith you have gained.\\"  Also, John McDonald in his book, The Message of a Master, gives another reason for silence: \\"When you persistently hold to your goal, and keep absolutely air-tight secretiveness, the Outer Mind [the same as R.H.J.'s objective mind] finds no escape for its increasing energy, and in desperation it plunges through, like the overload of steam through the safety valve of a boiler, and your objective is reached.\\"  He expounds on this opposing energy from the outer/objective mind and how to use it constructively.  Remember, \\"Silence is Golden\\" because it fosters faith!  (See also what the Apostle Paul says in Romans and Galatians about the \\"flesh\\" (KJV) or \\"sinful nature\\" (NIV) and how it wars against the spirit/Spirit within.)<br /><br />The second positive rule of accomplishment is \\"think of what you want as often as possible.\\"  This rule involves persistent thought, but it fails to specifically include the principle of visualization of one's earnest desires as already obtained, a principle that is emphasized by Napoleon Hill, Wallace Wattles, Charles Haanel, John McDonald, and others.  The author also fails to address the possibility of disappointment where some of one's sincere, earnest desires will NOT come to pass.  The reason is because something BETTER may come along to REPLACE them so that, as Wattles said, \\"the seeming failure was really a great success\\".  Wattles discusses this in his book in the chapter on cautions and concluding observations.  This principle of replacement may also mean getting the better things AFTER PHYSICAL DEATH which, of course, means that one must believe in an afterlife.  R.H.J. talks of an afterlife, but only negatively where obtaining some desires may \\"rob you of eternal life\\", and he doesn't explain what exactly this means (hell? annihilation?).<br /><br />For those who enjoyed this booklet, R.H.J. has written another, longer and out-of-print work that better explains some things within and underlying It Works.  It is the superior of the two!  The book is titled \\"The Meaning of the Mark\\" which refers to a certain symbol or mark of a cross and square (involving the divine & human, heaven & earth relations - which reminds me of the compass over the square in the Masonic symbol and the Hermetic principle of \\"As Above, So Below\\".  See also Matthew 6:10 in Eugene Peterson's version of the Bible, The Message, which translates \\"on earth as it is in heaven\\" as \\"as above, so below\\"!).  This cross-square symbol was on the cover of the earlier printings of It Works, but is now missing, probably since it isn't discussed in the booklet.

This cross-square symbol was on the cover of the earlier printings of It Works, but is now missing, probably since it isn't discussed in the booklet.  The later book will \\"open up\\" the earlier booklet, if you can find it.  Thanks Wayne for bringing it to my attention and letting me borrow your copy!	2005-03-17

According to Douglas, the \\"now moment\\" means that \\"there is no potential to associate an opportunity to get into, get out of, add too, or detract from a trade with a past experience that already exists in your mental environment\\" (pg. 130).  Consistently successful trading requires a high degree of mental flexibility, based on certain fearless attitudes and a probabilistic mind-set, to flow in and out of trades based on what the market is saying about the possibilities from its perspective.  One must have a trading system that eliminates one's susceptibility to typical trading errors (as listed on page 186) and duplicates how a casino operates.  Like the casinos, the consistently successful traders know that over a series of events (or trades), the odds are in their favor, but in order to realize the benefits of the favorable odds, they have to participate in every event (or trade).  In other words, they know they won't be successful on every single trade at the micro level, but on the macro level the outcomes over a series of trades will produce consistently successful results provided that the following is true: 1) one has an edge that genuinely puts the odds of success in your favor; 2) you can think about trading in the appropriate manner, and 3) you can do everything you need to do over a series of trades.  Regarding the first, you must know what defines an edge which requires you to be well educated in market/technical analysis.  Douglas assumes that most of the people reading his book have this education.  Regarding the second, Douglas provides five fundamental truths that must be mentally absorbed to approach trading successfully.  Regarding the third, Douglas provides a trading exercise in the last chapter that requires your trading system to fit within seven specifications (from trade entry to accepting the risk).  The purpose of the exercise is to help integrate the five fundamental truths into your mind (belief system).<br /><br />In addition to the five fundamental truths, Douglas also provides in the last chapter seven complementary principles of consistency which he calls \\"sub-beliefs\\" to, or reasons for, the primary objective of believing one is a consistent winner at trading.  He also introduces and explains the trader's three stages of development: the mechanical, the subjective, and the intuitive.  The first ten chapters of the book contain a lot of general information related to beliefs and expectations that is beneficial to self-understanding outside of trading but is specifically applied to trading as preparation for the essential and culminating last chapter, Thinking Like a Trader, which includes the trading exercise.  For experienced traders, I recommend completing the survey at the beginning of the book and then, after one has studied the text, complete it again to see how the book's content impacted one's trading beliefs and practice.  As a novice to the field of trading, I consider this book essential reading for both newcomers and professionals although the latter will probably appreciate it more.en specifications (from trade entry to accepting the risk).

US	52496001	R2X3CP8TKJOSWP	0310253853	328858556	The Post-Evangelical (Emergent YS)	Books	4	20	22	N	N	A Catalyst for Further Thought & Discussion	This book should be viewed as a catalyst for further thought and discussion on the topics raised. It touches the heartbeat of a growing \\"in-house\\" trend of dissatisfaction with contemporary evangelical culture as organizationally, and in some cases doctrinally and practically, expressed that leaves some \\"evangelicals,\\" including myself, feeling that they have strayed from the flock when, in fact, they may have discovered the vital bloodstream of the biblical faith that has been clouded over with trivialities and, in some cases, error throughout the years. Dallas Willard states in his forward to the revised North American edition, \\"post-evangelicalism is by no means ex-evangelicalism... post-evangelicals are evangelicals, perhaps tenaciously so. However, post-evangelicals have also been driven to the margins by some aspects of evangelical church culture with which they cannot honestly identify.\\" With that said, however, Tomlinson points out that some who strongly identify with what the book discusses \\"may not all be evangelicals\\" although they certainly are post-moderns.<br /><br /> My own alienation with certain aspects of contemporary evangelical culture as well as Dallas Willard's forward to this book is why I read it. And although some reviewers disliked the supplemental comments by the book's contributors, I felt that several of them provided good clarifications and critiques whereas others were off the mark. Also, some readers would not consider Tomlinson as the principle representative for their brand of \\"post-evangelicalism\\" which is general and vague enough to allow for different brands among those who identify with it. Additionally, post-evangelicalism should not be confused with what was once called \\"the new evangelical theology\\" or neo-evangelicalism (as Mark Galli seems to do in one of his comments on pg. 27) which is an evangelical reaction against the fundamentalist branch of evangelicalism. See page 73 and Robert P. Lightner's \\"Neo-Evangelicalism\\" (if you can find a copy). To be sure, post-evangelicalism is against a rigid and legalistic fundamentalism, but it is more than that.<br /><br /> Among other flaws, I personally consider the discussion on truth inadequate and think Mark Galli's commentary on page 94 valid: \\"Post-evangelicals will admit to using propositional statements, but they seem to have a hard time admitting how utterly dependent they are on such reasoning\\" (cf. his other comments on pg. 82, note (e)). However, what I find overlooked by critics like Galli (and Christian apologists in general) is the tendency to under-appreciate the important subjective/objective distinction between being sincerely right, sincerely wrong, and insincere. Does God respect sincerity, even if one (Christian or non-Christian) is \\"objectively\\" or \\"propositionally\\" wrong? I would say that he does (apart from any possible but temporary negative consequences for being wrong) and such popular sayings as \\"the road to hell is paved with good intentions\\" as used by many evangelicals miss the mark. Is the road to heaven paved with bad intentions? One area that needed emphasis in the book is how post-evangelicals are more generally \\"inclusivist\\" than \\"pluralist\\" when it comes to HOW \\"salvation\\" occurs than most evangelicals who are primarily \\"exclusivists\\" (who believe that if you don't have a volitional [and propositional] \\"faith in Christ\\" before you die, then you're going to hell.). [As an aside, although most Christians are inclusivists when it comes to infants where divine grace alone is sufficent for the salvation of dead infants, there is less tolerance for adults which raises the rarely-analyzed question of exactly how a person is ultimately \\"damned\\". Many evangelicals pessimistically believe that everybody is on the road to hell until they have \\"faith in Christ\\" instead of believing more optimistically that Christ's atonement puts everybody on the road to heaven until they commit the sin that damns which puts the responsibility of damnation primarily in the individual's hands, not solely in God's.] Also, there is a growing emphasis among Christians (thanks to authors like Dallas Willard, Richard Foster, etc.) that salvation is primarily about a relational discipleship to Christ IN THIS LIFE (not just salvation from hell [however defined] in the next). As one walks with Christ through the Spirit and the Word, one is personally and progressively saved from sin and deception.<br /><br /> Another trend I've noticed that some post-evangelicals will support but isn't emphasized in the book is the rejection of monetary tithing as a biblical mandate to fund organizational churches. Non-tithing books like \\"Beyond Tithes and Offerings,\\" \\"Should the Church Teach Tithing?,\\" and \\"Tithing and Still Broke\\" are becoming popular and hard to refute which will require a reformation to the contemporary Christian understanding of giving to meet people's needs. \\"Grace giving\\" with financial intelligence is the wave of the future. There is so much more that can be said but, again, consider the book (and this review) a catalyst for further thought and discussion.amnation primarily in the individual's hands, not solely in God's.] Also, there is a growing emphasis among Christians (thanks to authors like Dallas Willard, Richard Foster, etc.) that salvation is primarily about a relational discipleship to Christ IN THIS LIFE (not just salvation from hell [however defined] in the next).

Wattles wrote several books but is best known for his prosperity classic, The Science of Getting Rich.  Wattles is an early author within the New Thought Movement whose book is making a comeback along with Charles Haanel's The Master Key System.  Those who have read both works will notice their similarities, including their use of creative visualization as the primary tool for creative application of the karmic \\"Law of Attraction.\\"  The element that underlies this Law and gives purpose to one's visualization is strong desire mixed with unwavering faith in Omnipotent Goodness (or God) which is omnipresent and, therefore, in residence within as one's essential Source of empowerment.  One must first know what one wants and want it badly enough to do whatever it takes (within ethical limits) to get it.  This idea is expounded in other New Thought publications such as \\"It Works\\" by R.H.J. and \\"The Ultimate Secret To Getting Absolutely Everything You Want\\" by Mike Hernacki.  Creative visualization requires one to imagine what one strongly desires (to be, do, or have) and take what Wattles calls \\"the Mental Attitude of Ownership\\" toward everything in one's mental picture.  One must persistently visualize oneself as being, doing, or having whatever one wants, and be deeply grateful for it both before and after one actually gets it.  According to Wattles, \\"the man who can sincerely thank God for the things which as yet he owns only in imagination, has real faith.\\"<br />Wattles' view of God is pantheistic (All is God), which is rooted in monism (All is One; One is All).  He admits this in his preface and refers the reader to Oriental philosophies and thinkers like Spinoza, Hegel, and Emerson for the philosophical foundations of his book.  He freely alternates between the personal pronoun \\"He\\" with the use of \\"God\\" and impersonal terms like \\"the Universe,\\" \\"Nature,\\" \\"Original Substance,\\" \\"Formless Stuff,\\" etc. in reference to the Intelligent \\"One Thing\\" that lives, thinks and seeks increasing expressions of abundant life through creation (including creating through us via desire, will and imagination).  His intent is practical, not philosophical.  The book is \\"intended for the men and women whose most pressing need is for money; who wish to get rich first, and philosophize afterward.\\"  The \\"science\\" in the book's title refers to the \\"natural law\\" that \\"like causes always produce like effects; and, therefore, any man or woman who learns to do things in this certain way will infallibly get rich.\\"  In Chapter 4, Wattles says that the first step towards getting rich is \\"to acquire the ability to think the way you want to think\\" which he defines as thinking \\"TRUTH,\\" regardless of appearances.  Does anybody desire poverty or disease?  No; therefore, poverty and disease are considered only temporary appearances whereas the reality is abundance and health as desired by All.<br />Wattles sees economics from a divine perspective where scarcity isn't a problem.  Therefore, he is at odds with contemporary economists like Thomas Sowell who, in his book Basic Economics, defines economics in terms of scarcity.  According to Sowell, \\"Scarcity means that everyone's desires cannot be satisfied completely, regardless of which particular economic system or economic policy we choose - and regardless of whether an individual or a society is poor or affluent.  Therefore competition among people for these resources is inherent.\\"  Wattles strongly disagrees and affirms that the supply is limitless because it transcends the visible supply in the \\"limitless riches of Formless Substance\\" out of which all things are made and continually being made.  He calls his readers to \\"rise from the competitive to the creative plane\\" and bases his ethic on the creative mindset, which is without fear or haste.  More life is sought for all, and every person should be given more in use value than any cash value received.  According to Wattles, \\"you can only get what isyours by giving the other man what is his.\\"<br />Although I disagree with the monistic and/or pantheistic world view, I think Wattles has some insightful things to say that may be divorced from monism but are essential to a unified concept of a personal God and His creation as essentially GOOD, not evil.  Although Wattles says in Chapter 1 that he shall not speak of riches in a figurative way, it is clear that he views wealth more as abundant life than mere cash.  However, one of several flaws in the book is that he doesn't discuss in detail the important question of WHEN one can expect to get one's most pressing need for money fulfilled and whether death may thwart one's quest or be overcome.  Only if death is no obstacle can he boldly say, as in his preface, that \\"failure is impossible.\\"yours by giving the other man what is his.\\"<br />Although I disagree with the monistic and/or pantheistic world view, I think Wattles has some insightful things to say that may be divorced from monism but are essential to a unified concept of a personal God and His creation as essentially GOOD, not evil.

US	52496001	R25FYKO9IVHVQL	0964483203	835666260	Are men born sinners?: The myth of original sin	Books	3	9	15	N	N	Some Good Points, but Raises Unanswered Questions	The underlying assumption of this book is that all sin is willful.  This means that all actual sin is intentional, the result of choosing what one knows is wrong.  It is choosing sin knowing it is sin.  Now, if this was true, then there could be no \\"sins of ignorance\\" or unintentional sin, where some sins are committed not knowing they are sins.  Yet scripture clearly teaches that there are such sins (e.g., Numbers 15:22 - 29) and contrasts them with willful sin (a.k.a., presumptuous, deliberate or defiant sin, see Numbers 15:30 - 31).  Psalms 19:12 - 13 speaks of hidden faults and willful (or presumptuous) sins thereby making a distinction.  In the New Testament, Christ distinguished between willful and unconscious sin and assigned a harsher punishment to the servant who willfully sinned (Luke 12:47 - 48).  Hebrews 10:26 speaks of ongoing \\"willful\\" (or \\"deliberate\\") sin and the seriousness of its consequences.  If all sin is willful, then there is no reason to use the adjective \\"willful\\" with the word \\"sin\\" which implies that some sin is NOT willful.  Even the Apostle Paul stated that he was conscious of nothing against himself (in other words, he had a clear conscience), yet he wasn't by this fact acquitted (1 Cor. 4:4-5).<br /><br />It is interesting that the author flatly denies what scripture clearly affirms: all have sinned, and fallen short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23; cf. Romans 5:12).  This means that infants are no exception, even if they haven't yet reached the \\"age of accountability.\\"  But remember, not all sin is willful as the above scriptures clearly show, so it is false to teach that one has to reach the age of accountability before one is capable of any sin.  Such an age only enables one to willfully sin, not sin in general (including unconsciously sin).  The author's interpretation of Romans 5:12 - 19 is weak and his explanatory quote from Sheldon is ambiguous.  Sheldon states in part: \\"The Apostle here draws a comparison between the evil potency in the sinning Adam and the beneficent or saving potency in the righteous Christ... Both are pictured rather according to their tendency than according to literal fact.\\"  But isn't a \\"tendency\\" real, a literal fact?  And what does \\"evil potency\\" mean?  Adam's ability to sin or not sin before his Fall surely cannot be considered an \\"evil\\" potency since this good freedom came directly from God.  Does the idea that all are born sinners impugn God as the Creator and mean that all who die in infancy without a volitional faith in Christ are damned to hell?  No.  Many Christians who believe that infants are non-willful sinners also believe in the salvation of dead infants and there are several scriptures, some of which the author uses, that strongly imply their salvation.  One book that explores the various positions and scriptures regarding infant salvation is Norman Geisler's \\"Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics.\\"<br /><br />It is interesting that in order to explain the apparent universality of sin, the author appeals to temptation.  Although he calls temptation \\"the occasion to all sin,\\" he seems to imply that temptation CAUSES one to sin.  In Chapter 5 (Objections Answered) he asks: \\"What was it that caused them [Adam & Eve] to sin so easily?\\"  His answer: \\"It was not a sinful nature, it was temptation.\\"  So, temptation caused Adam and Eve to sin.  Although Appendix E shows that he means that temptation is the OCCASION to sin, not the cause of it, the fact that he feels the need to explain its universality and uses the idea of temptation seems self-incriminating.  Although I'm sure he believes that one can overcome any and all temptation, his use of temptation to explain sin's universality strongly implies that temptation is just as universal as the sin it occasions and is, therefore, the inevitable cause of it.  The point?  It seems that something more than temptation is required to explain sin's universality.<br /><br />In closing I'd like to say that Ishare the author's concern regarding the need to defend God's goodness in the face of evil in general and sin in particular, including the idea that some will enter hell and that God is not the sole cause of their damnation (i.e., the doctrine of unconditional reprobation is false).  But the author leaves much to be explored regarding the existence of sin and evil and the fact that the Eternal God of Goodness enabled and allows their existence for his good purposes.s concern regarding the need to defend God's goodness in the face of evil in general and sin in particular, including the idea that some will enter hell and that God is not the sole cause of their damnation (i.e., the doctrine of unconditional reprobation is false).

Nelson was a respected Pentecostal, Assemblies of God minister who was, and is, better known for his book \\"Bible Doctrines,\\" also published by the Gospel Publishing House (GPH).  Nelson's book \\"The Letters of Paul\\" was copyrighted by Myrtle E. Nelson in 1945 and the revised edition was published in 1976 by GPH.  The reason I make this information available is because of the nature of this work.  It is intended as a reference tool for studying the Apostle Paul's letters in outline format using various commentaries and translations of the scriptures available to Mr. Nelson at the time.  Some of the translations are not popular today.  For example, Mr. Nelson uses Arthur S. Way's \\"The Letters of St. Paul and Hebrews\\" as well as \\"The New Testament Revised and Translated\\" by A. S. Worrell and \\"The New Testament: A New Translation\\" by James Moffatt.  Of course, the standard King James Version is used along with the American Revised Version.  Some of the commentaries consulted are better known such as those by Alexander Maclaren, Albert Barnes, Charles Hodge, \\"Jamieson, Fausset &amp; Brown,\\" and Adam Clarke, among others.<br />Although unpopular translations are sometimes used for quotes, they are nonetheless helpful and the work as a whole is a valuable tool.  Also, Mr. Nelson recommends in his Preface using more than one translation of the letters to compare with the outlines.  He also states that his intention was to \\"gather up every germane thought and to express it briefly, sometimes in words similar to those in the text, and sometimes in entirely different words, and to make manifest to the eye the relation of each part to the whole.\\"  This he does brilliantly.<br />Paul's letters have opened up to me in a powerfully memorable way by using this book.  Each letter is given a short introduction, a condensed outline, and an extended outline with notes and footnotes.  Also included is the letter to the Hebrews which some Bible scholars do not think was authored by Paul but contains thoughts that are certainly \\"Pauline\\" in many ways so that other equally qualified scholars think the letter was authored by Paul.  Mr. Nelson's Pentecostal beliefs also show in his interpretive notes, but those who aren't Pentecostal or Charismatic can still benefit from this book.  Because it is in outline format, it makes a great Bible study tool not only for Christians in general but also for Pastors, Teachers and others who are involved in public speaking and sermon preparation.  As a layman and Sunday School teacher, this book has helped me master the content of the letters by seeing their main points, the logic of their arguments, and their relationship to each other.

Maturin's book is comprised of nine chapters, each with a prescriptive title requiring action from the reader as follows: 1) Develop self-knowledge; 2) Discipline yourself; 3) Abide by the laws of the spirit; 4) Train your will; 5) Control your thoughts; 6) Strive for balance; 7) Govern your body; 8) Sacrifice the good for what is better; 9) Persevere.<br /><br />According to Maturin, Christian self-mastery is based on two spheres of knowledge: knowledge of God and of ourselves.  \\"To know God is to know self\\" (pg. 6).  He emphasizes in Chapter 1 our self-ignorance and how we can attain to self-knowledge, which he distinguished from self-analysis.  We must also test our self-knowledge and learn to examine ourselves in the light of Christ.  In Chapter 2, he clears up confusion regarding the nature of sin and points out that no human faculty is bad in itself but can be misdirected.  \\"When we take these God-given powers and use them for an unworthy end, we sin\\" (pg. 41).  We must turn our God-given powers to the good.  He also states that the true principle of all Christian self-discipline is the same one that inspired Christ who, for the joy set before him, endured the cross.  Discipline is a means to a glorious end, not an end in itself.  Maturin also admonishes us to subdue our rebellious will.  Here is where the reader must carefully study and compare chapters because throughout the remainder of the book, he attributes the will to the \\"law of the members\\" that is under the \\"law of habit\\" and the \\"law of sin\\".  Chapter 3 distinguished between four laws as presented by the apostle Paul in the book of Romans: the law of the members which ties into the law of sin, and the law of the mind (the conscience) which ties into the law of the Spirit of Life that leads one to Christ.<br /><br />Chapter 4 introduces the law of habit and the law of perseverance.  The former is tied to the body (the law of the members) whereas the latter, in the sanctification process, is tied to the soul (the law of the mind).  Here it is emphasized that choosing the good grows easier with habit through perseverance.  This chapter introduces the concept of character and explains how there are many forces that form it.  Also, Maturin points out that one's character will last beyond this life.  One critical point to remember here is what he calls the one measure of every character which is addressed by the following two-fold question: \\"Does the will strive after what the man believes to be right, or does it deliberately and consciously choose what he believes to be wrong?\\"  He continues: \\"The answer that his life gives to these questions will enable us to form a very good estimate of his character.\\"  Although Maturin attributes the will to the law of the members, he is addressing the soul throughout the book which implies that the soul has a will of its own that either strives to do good or deliberately chooses what it believes to be wrong.  The \\"will of the flesh\\" must be subdued by the will of the soul.  In fact, in Chapter 7 we are told to submit our flesh to our spirit.  Another area that will require careful study is how Maturin uses the terms flesh and spirit, on the one hand, and body and soul on the other.  They are not necessarily synonymous, so one must look at the context to determine how these terms are used because he doesn't clearly define them.  Chapter 5 is paramount.  Here Maturin notes that our thoughts color our experience, but we can drive out bad thoughts with good ones and the mind can be trained to habitually choose certain thoughts.  Controlling one's thoughts requires prudence.  Also, the memory and imagination are important guides that should not be abused.<br /><br />Chapter 6 introduces the concept of balance not only internally, within one's soul, but also externally among one'srelationships.  He also wisely points out the positive use of the emotions, including hate and anger.  Chapter 7 discusses the physical body and the proper, balanced care of it and how it relates to one's resurrected body.  He also says we should deny it whatever weakens our soul's union with God.  Chapter 8 notes that mortification isn't an end in itself.  He also points out the balance necessary to understanding how life and death relate to the Christian walk.  We must be ready to \\"die\\" to rise to a higher state of life.  Life progresses through death as we surrender to God's grace and Christ imparts divine life to us.  Chapter 9 is the shortest one and reiterates the fact that life is the school of character and we need to persevere.

US	52496001	R23VXM5MPHBY6I	0060653019	759467388	Miracles	Books	4	3	5	N	N	A Preliminary Study on Christian Miracles	According to C. S. Lewis, this book is intended as a preliminary to historical inquiry. It does not, therefore, examine the historical evidence for Christian miracles, but is intended to put readers in a position to do so. Lewis states: \\"It is no use going to the texts until we have some idea about the possibility or probability of the miraculous. Those who assume that miracles cannot happen are merely wasting their time by looking into the texts: we know in advance what results they will find for they have begun by begging the question.\\" In his appeal to the \\"common reader\\" and not specifically to theologians, Lewis defines a miracle broadly as \\"an interference with Nature by supernatural power.\\" This distinction between the natural and supernatural is presupposed and posited up front because Naturalists, according to Lewis, believe that nothing exists except Nature (Nature is considered \\"the whole show,\\" the \\"Total System,\\" etc.) which, if true, rules out the possibility of the supernatural. Nature is considered by Lewis, and Supernaturalists in general, as a partial system within reality, not Reality itself. It is a created thing (abstractly speaking), not the self-existent Creator. Lewis argues by analogy and uses human reason and morality as examples of the supernatural that are distinct from Nature. In fact, Lewis argues that humans, as compositions of the natural and supernatural, intervene in Nature by supernatural acts (which he considers self-determined acts not caused by another in some inevitable causal chain). But he admits (see Chapter 6) that such acts are not what many equate with \\"miracles\\" since they are both familiar and regular (not to mention humanly caused). Therefore, he ends Chapter 6 by saying in effect that the rest of the book will concern itself with miracles as special divine interventions.<br /><br />For Lewis, the cardinal difficulty with Naturalism is the existence of human reason and its thoughts which can be either true or false, unlike events in general which are not \\"about\\" anything and therefore cannot be true or false. According to Lewis, the Naturalist believes that reason, sentience, and life itself are late comers in an historical, evolutionary process that was not DESIGNED to produce a mental behavior that can find truth (including moral truth). Therefore, Naturalism doesn't adequately explain the existence of reason (and morality). For theism, on the other hand, reason (divine reason) is before Nature and our own concept of Nature depends on reason. Later, in Chapter 13, Lewis argues that theism ratifies faith in the scientific principle of uniformity [which is used by some, like David Hume, to argue against miracles], but disallows making uniformity absolute. But if Naturalism is true, then we have no reason to trust our conviction that Nature is uniform in any sense (general or absolute). In Chapters 14 - 16, Lewis tries to present the central miracles of the Christian Faith in such a way as to exhibit their \\"fitness\\" into Nature w/o setting forth any abstract conditions which \\"fitness\\" must satisfy because \\"our sense of fitness is too delicate and elusive\\". By \\"fitness\\" Lewis means their historical probability [i.e., compatibility w/ Nature] which he distinguishes from the \\"antecedent probability of chances\\" [i.e., mathematical probability]. In Chapters 7 & 8, Lewis responds to objections that Nature doesn't allow miracles. In Chapter 8 he points out that the laws of Nature don't cause anything because \\"every law, in the last resort, says 'If you have A, then you will get B.' But first catch your A: the laws won't do it for you.\\" This allows for \\"supernatural\\" causation, human or divine. In Chapter 10, Lewis addresses language as it relates to thought and points out that clear thinking is distinct from imagination in general and metaphor in particular which are used both in scripture and common discourse when discussing metaphysical things (like God and his activity). Chapter 11 addresses pantheism [a special type of idealistic naturalism distinct from the atheistic materialism which is Lewis's main focus] and points out some of its problems. Here Lewis states that God is concrete and individual; he is a particular Thing, not an abstract \\"universal being\\" [distinct from omnipresence] which would rule out the possibility of creation because \\"a generality can make nothing\\".<br /><br />Although Lewis discusses some relevant issues regarding miracles in general (and New Testament ones in particular) and their compatibility with Nature, he does strangely relegate at least some Old Testament miracles to the realm of myth which is partly due to his unique view that in Christ myth became history. For a critical analysis of Lewis' view, see Norman Geisler's chapter on Lewis titled \\"Christian Humanism\\" in his book \\"Is Man the Measure?\\" For a more recent systematic analysis of miracles that relies heavily on Lewis, see Geisler's \\"Miracles and the Modern Mind\\" (OP) and \\"In Defense of Miracles,\\" edited by Geivett and Habermas. Also, see Collins's \\"The God of Miracles\\" which notably points out that some Christians have negatively reviewed Lewis's book because they think Lewis was operating with a defective understanding of \\"nature\\" and divine action [note: pantheists and panentheists would also affirm this]. Collins addresses these other positions within Christianity which differ from the \\"supernaturalism\\" of Lewis, Geisler and Collins himself. Also, Lewis doesn't address whether miracles are applicable today and, if so, to what extent.

In this book he focuses primarily on the nature of the human will as it has been defined by prominent thinkers throughout Church history, especially as it is related to the topics of sin and salvation (regeneration primarily).  As Sproul shows, the Calvinistic understanding of the human will has its roots in Augustine and the distinction between freedom (defined as \\"the ability to choose w/o external constraint\\") and liberty (defined as \\"the ability to choose righteousness\\").  Liberty is lost because of the Adamic Fall; however, freedom as defined above is not.  The two terms, liberty and freedom, are not considered synonymous as they are for many today which is one of the reasons for misunderstanding from critics.  Also, Augustine isn't consistent in his use of terminology, as Sproul mildly points out, and therefore at times \\"seems to deny all freedom to the will of fallen man\\" (pg. 63).  This inconsistency is seen, for example, in Sproul's quote on pages 63 - 64 from the Enchiridion where Augustine states that man, by the evil use of his \\"free-will\\" destroyed both it and himself.  Later in the same quote Augustine uses the term \\"true liberty\\" in reference to freedom from sin thereby implying that \\"liberty\\" is synonymous with \\"free will\\" with the only difference being the adjectival term \\"true\\".  One must understand that Sproul \\"helps\\" Augustine be consistent.  What Augustine calls \\"true liberty\\" Sproul simply calls \\"liberty\\" in contrast to \\"freedom\\" in general in accordance with the above definitions.  Now, notice the definition given for \\"freedom.\\"  This is not the popular libertarian definition assumed by many, which is another source of misunderstanding.  Libertarian freedom is sometimes defined \\"the ability to do otherwise.\\"  This definition and view of freedom is held by Christian thinkers such as Norman Geisler, author of \\"Chosen But Free.\\"<br />Luther embraced Augustine's distinctions in his debate with Erasmus.  So also did Calvin, Turretin and later Jonathan Edwards.  Edwards provided further exposition on the Augustinian-Calvinist distinctions and affirmed that the will always chooses according to the strongest desire (motive, inclination, etc.), regardless of whether that desire is good or evil (this view is denied by those who hold to a libertarian view of freedom).  In line with Augustine's doctrine of original sin, Edwards held that man is born with a sinful nature and his will is in bondage to it until the Holy Spirit regenerates the sinner (assuming, of course, that the sinner is one of the elect) thereby freeing the will to believe in Christ and produce fruits of righteousness.  According to Calvinism, regeneration logically precedes faith and is the cause of it.  The five major thinkers: Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Turretin, and Edwards form a consistent and complementary historical stream.  In contrast with this stream, Sproul presents the following six thinkers who represent in greater or lesser degrees, the representative historical opposition: Pelagius, Cassian (a Semi-Pelagian), Erasmus, Arminius, Finney, and Chafer.<br />Although Sproul gives a good overall presentation of various positions and thinkers on the topic at hand, I feel that he could have better explained some of the issues that lend to misunderstanding.  Another example is Sproul's mention of the classic distinction between original sin and actual sin.  I've noticed that some who use the term \\"actual sin\\" in reference to sinful activity mistakenly think that original sin is not an actual type of sin but merely a potential to sin.  Yet Adam, before the Fall, had the potential to sin, but he didn't have a sinful nature that caused him to sin.  This is so even though, as Sproul explains, Augustine believed that Adam and Eve fell before they ate the fruit.  In other words, \\"the first actual sin was committed by creatures who were already fallen\\" (pg. 53).  Sproul should have cleared up this misunderstanding regarding original sin (the sinful nature).  Also, I'm surprised that Sproul didn't once reference John Wesley, especially since much of what passes as \\"Arminianism\\" today is influenced more by his views than those of Arminius himself.  Reformed Arminianism must be distinguished from Wesleyan \\"Arminianism\\".  For those who want to know the differences, see \\"Four Views on Eternal Security,\\" edited by J. Matthew Pinson.  Also, I recommend studying Mortimer J. Adler's book \\"The Idea of Freedom\\" which some consider to be the definitive 20th century study on the issue.  Although I'm not a Calvinist, I enjoy reading Sproul's books and learned much from \\"Willing to Believe.\\"  This is essential reading.sin was committed by creatures who were already fallen\\" (pg. 53).

It has been said that \\"Allen's work embodies the influence of Protestant liberalism on the one hand and of Buddhist thought on the other.\\" The fundamental message in AMT is that humans are masters of their own destinies. One is either a wise master or a foolish one. One becomes a wise master by becoming conscious of one's innate mental power to influence one's circumstances in life and by utilizing it to maximize good. The additional four books that comprise \\"The Wisdom of James Allen\\" flesh out this idea and the influence of Buddhist thought is more obvious. Allen's belief in the law of karma (which he equates with \\"Eternal Justice,\\" among other titles, and which some authors call \\"the law of attraction\\") underlies all of his books, and his embrace of the doctrine of rebirth (popularly known as reincarnation) is clear in some of them (e.g., The Mastery of Destiny, pg. 157). The orthodox Christian doctrines of heaven and hell as ultimate final destinies are rejected by Allen who reinterprets them as temporary states of mind that occur in THIS world as a result of human effort (see The Path to Prosperity, pg 134, and The Mastery of Destiny, pg. 160).  According to Allen, \\"all suffering is of self\\" and \\"all suffering ends in Truth\\" (The Way of Peace, pg. 160). Also, \\"All evil is corrective and remedial, and is therefore not permanent. It is rooted in ignorance, ignorance of the true nature and relation of things, and so long as we remain in that state of ignorance, we remain subject to evil\\" (The Path to Prosperity, pg. 67). Because all evil is corrective, remedial and impermanent, Allen in effect embraces a type of universalism where ALL humans will eventually be \\"saved\\" through the evolutionary, educative process of rebirth. His idea of the ultimate \\"salvation\\" of each individual in the human race is best represented by the following quote: \\"As the smallest drop of water detached from the ocean contains all the qualities of the ocean, so each person, detached in consciousness from the Infinite, contains within themselves its likeness; and as the drop of water must, by the law of nature, ultimately find its way back to the ocean and lose itself in the silent depths, so must each person, by the unfailing law of our nature, at last return to our source, and lose ourself in the great ocean of the Infinite\\" (The Way of Peace, pg. 288). Even if one rejects some or all of Allen's Buddhistic beliefs (like I do), one can still learn much from him regarding self-discipline and character development as they relate to positive and negative circumstances in one's life. According to Allen, \\"...even those who refuse to believe in rebirth will find that even in this life men almost invariably reap what they sow...\\" (The Mastery of Destiny, pg. 161).<br />Other \\"New Thought\\" type books I've read that, in various ways, complement Allen's works include the following: \\"The Wisdom of Florence Scovel Shinn,\\" \\"The Master Key System\\" by Charles Haanel, \\"The Science of Getting Rich\\" by Wallace Wattles, \\"Key to Yourself\\" by Venice Bloodworth, \\"In Tune With the Infinite\\" by Ralph Waldo Trine, \\"The Ultimate Secret to Getting Absolutely Everything You Want\\" by Mike Hernacki, and \\"Practicing the Presence of God for Practical Purposes\\" by Anderson & Whitehouse.<br />\\"Self and error are synonymous.\\" - James Allen (The Way of Peace)by the following quote: \\"As the smallest drop of water detached from the ocean contains all the qualities of the ocean, so each person, detached in consciousness from the Infinite, contains within themselves its likeness; and as the drop of water must, by the law of nature, ultimately find its way back to the ocean and lose itself in the silent depths, so must each person, by the unfailing law of our nature, at last return to our source, and lose ourself in the great ocean of the Infinite\\" (The Way of Peace, pg. 288).

Although this is true, I would qualify it by saying that the book raises, and defends, Calvinistic themes.  Bianchi's intent is to provide a simple, clear and consistent presentation and defense of the Reformed understanding of the Gospel without extensive exposition and stacking of \\"proof texts.\\"  This does not mean, however, that Bianchi doesn't utilize his own \\"proof texts\\" in an effort to support his Reformed interpretation of them.  Although this is a good, simple introduction to some of the key doctrines of Reformed thought, there are better, more in-depth introductions that I'd recommend instead such as R.C. Sproul's &quot;Chosen by God.&quot;  There are also better Calvinistic defenses such as James White's &quot;The Potter's Freedom&quot; (which Bianchi suggests for further reading).  As a non-Calvinist, however, I think Bianchi's book fails to address certain crucial issues like the divine rationale for establishing the so-called \\"total depravity\\" of ALL of Adam's descendants in the first place.  He merely posits the doctrine, based on certain scriptures, and then argues for the merciful divine election of SOME based on it.  This implies an unconditional divine reprobation of all those not elect in Christ.  I can't tell whether Bianchi is a supralapsarian like, for example, R.C. Sproul, Jr. who, in his book \\"Almighty Over All,\\" does provide a rationale for unconditional divine reprobation with, I might add, disturbing clarity.  Personally, I think Sproul, Jr. is more consistent than many other Calvinists (including his dad) when it comes to the implications of Calvinism (such as the unconditional divine reprobation of some), although I fundamentally disagree with Calvinism in general because of its understanding of the biblical parallel between Adam and Christ in Romans 5.  I think Calvinism does not do justice to the biblical parallel because it defines original sin as the total depravity of ALL in Adam which is then used to support the unconditional divine election of SOME in Christ.  This, to me, supports the idea of unconditional divine reprobation and/or damnation.<br />For an alternative, challenging attempt at understanding the biblical parallel between Adam and Christ (and the so-called \\"universalistic texts\\") than the one usually given by most Calvinists, Bianchi included, I recommend the books of Calvinist Neal Punt, a retired pastor in the Christian Reformed Church and a graduate from Calvin Theological Seminary.  Although Punt's books didn't make a Calvinist out of me, he certainly contributed to my eventual renunciation of Arminianism with its \\"conditional\\" divine election of some based on God's foreknowledge.  For additional insights, see my reviews of Punt's three books: \\"Unconditional Good News,\\" \\"What's Good About the Good News?,\\" and \\"So Also in Christ.\\"l because it defines original sin as the total depravity of ALL in Adam which is then used to support the unconditional divine election of SOME in Christ.

Haanel	Books	3	135	190	N	Y	The Master Key is Mental Alchemy	\\"One of the old Hermetic Masters wrote, long ages ago: `He who grasps the truth of the Mental Nature of the Universe is well advanced on The Path to Mastery.'  And these words are as true today as at the time they were first written.  Without this Master-Key, Mastery is impossible, and the student knocks in vain at the many doors of The Temple.\\"  This quote was taken from a book of Hermetic Philosophy called \\"The Kybalion\\" (pg. 28) which was published at the beginning of the 20th century and anonymously written by \\"Three Initiates\\" but is reputed to be authored or co-authored by William Walker Atkinson, one of the authors quoted by Haanel in his book \\"The Master Key System\\".  As a 32-degree Mason, Mr. Haanel was certainly familiar with esoteric philosophy (incl. Hermeticism and Kabbalah) and a comparison between Haanel's book and \\"The Kybalion\\" will reveal many commonalities, including an exposition of the causal, magnetic and compensatory Law of Attraction (like attracts like).  Haanel's maxim of \\"As Within, So Without\\" is reflective of the Hermetic \\"As Above, So Below\\" and those familiar with the Hindu Upanishads, some sacred writings of India, will see how this relates to the Hindu idea that atman is Brahman or, to use Haanel's terms, the individual (\\"below\\") is one with the Universal (\\"above\\").  Also, the Law of Attraction is reflective of the Law of Karma.  The Master Key of the Kybalion is the same as the Master Key of Haanel's book.  The Key is the understanding and practical application of Hermetic principles which are rooted in the foundational idea of the essential oneness of the individual and the Universal, Creative Source  (which some call \\"God\\").  According to Haanel, when this truth is understood and appreciated, one \\"will have come into the possession of the Master-Key\\" (Week Twenty-Four: Alchemy, page 197).  In the \\"Questions and Answers\\" section of Haanel's book, he doesn't really answer the question, \\"Is not the Master Key Idea of `God' Pantheistic?\\"  He basically just asserts that \\"this depends entirely upon your idea of Pantheism.\\"  Like the Kybalion, Haanel's idea of God is more bi-polar and panentheistic (All in God, God in All) than pantheistic (All is God) and both use the Bible's  New Testament reference which states: \\"In Him we live and move and have our being\\" (a quote from the Apostle Paul in Acts 17:28).  Panentheism (a.k.a. Process Theism) gained in popularity in the 20th century after A. N. Whitehead's book \\"Process and Reality\\" was first published in 1929.  Also, the New Thought Movement (of which Haanel is considered by some to be a part) has recently recognized the value of panentheism through the New Thoughters Anderson and Whitehouse.  See their book \\"New Thought: A Practical American Spirituality\\" where they acknowledge that pantheism underlies much of classical New Thought but see the philosophical problems of it and recommend panentheism instead by promoting Process New Thought a la Whitehead.<br />Hannel is one among many authors that were inspired by the nineteenth century's growing interest in esoteric philosophy and practical mysticism that spread throughout Europe and America.  Some of the individuals (R. W. Emerson, Thomas Troward, W.W. Atkinson, James Allen, etc.) referenced or quoted in Hannel's work reveal his influences and links to the broader inter-connected movements, including the Transcendental and New Thought Movements.  The 19th century also saw the founding of both the Theosophical Society and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, notable occult groups that explored the metaphysical laws of the Universe and eventually contributed (along with the other movements) to the current so-called \\"New Age Movement\\" with its Neo-Paganism and modern \\"magic\\".<br />With all that aside, one doesn't have to be a pantheist or panentheist (I am neither) to appreciate some of Haanel's insights.  God is indeed the Omni-Source of all power, and the power of the human mind (both the conscious and subconscious aspects) to influence one's perception of reality and even contribute to it (including psychosomatically) certainly needs to be taken seriously.  Also, the importance of self-discipline to one's overall success in life should not be underestimated.  Human responsibility is an important factor in the human situation as is education, and the application (including mental application via meditation), not just knowledge, is what will effect change for the better not only in one's habits but also in one's circumstances.scious and subconscious aspects) to influence one's perception of reality and even contribute to it (including psychosomatically) certainly needs to be taken seriously.

Also, one is introduced to some of the fencing masters, both male and female, and provided with miscellaneous resources in Appendix II related to the U.S. Fencing Association and its magazine (American Fencing), fencing equipment supply companies, sword movies, and lists of fiction and non-fiction books related to swords and fencing.  Mr. Evangelista was an apprentice to fencing master Ralph Faulkner and, like his master, promotes the classical style of fencing and form - \\"fencing's yardstick\\" - which emphasizes personal control over oneself first and then one's opponents.  Control begins within: \\"True fencing takes place between the brain and the sword hand rather than between the tip of your weapon and the opponents chest\\" (pg. 41).  There is more to fencing than just competition, although that's important too.  \\"Mastery - real, certifiable mastery, not just a few overblown victories here and there - must flow from a set point of effective behavior patterns.  Classical form, with its demands for balance, grace, efficiency and accuracy, sets up such a rarefied atmosphere.  We are given a sound blueprint that has been tested and polished for centuries\\" (pg. 159).<br />Some who have been trained in the \\"modern\\" style of fencing will be put off by some of what the author says.  For instance, he firmly believes that one should start with the foil before moving to the epee and then the sabre.  Also, he doesn't think one should bout until one has \\"gone through a progression of learning that includes a thorough blend of both physical and mental approaches to fencing\\" (pg. 68).  Why? \\"This enables the student to fully understand his relationship to his opponent on the fencing strip.\\"  Regarding competition, he would never allow \\"a student to enter a tournament until he had bouted for at least a year.\\"  Building a solid foundation is important to classical style fencing.  Regardless of whether one sticks with this classical approach, there is plenty to learn from this book for the new fencing student.  Because of Mr. Evangelista's book, I've chosen to start with the foil and although my early training is mixed with bouting, I have been complimented by fellow students who have asked whether I've fenced before.  One actually said I \\"seem controlled\\".  Applying the principles in this book has contributed to that control.  Highly recommended.allow \\"a student to enter a tournament until he had bouted for at least a year.\\"  Building a solid foundation is important to classical style fencing.

One is where the practice or journey of mastery in a given area is satisfying as an end in itself (hence, ultimately \\"goalless\\").  The other is where practice is a means to the achievement of progressively higher goals or levels of skill.  The first dimension is essential to enduring those relatively long plateaus of process without any apparent progress which stretch in between those climactic and conscious spurts of achievement.  Enjoying the practice itself gives one the patience necessary to endure the plateaus which nonetheless have the important role of making one's regular practice or routine second-nature.  So, one is still progressing during the seemingly \\"stagnant\\" plateaus, but at a subconscious level.  Those who seek mastery in a given area for superficial reasons or expect perpetually conscious progress will be easily and quickly discouraged and stop practicing.  Both the \\"Dabbler\\" and the \\"Excessive\\" fall into this category.  The \\"Hacker,\\" on the other hand, likes the plateau.  This person is happy with just surviving rather than thriving on the edge.  S/he is content with mediocrity rather than growth, is satisfied with a limited mastery of a few things instead of increasing his or her mastery by stepping out of one's comfort zones and those of others (which sometimes express themselves in homeostasis that resists change, bad... or good).  As one becomes more skilled in one's chosen field(s) of expertise (eventually becoming an esteemed \\"black belt\\"), Mr. Leonard emphasizes that one should always maintain the humble mind-set of a beginner (a \\"white belt\\" or \\"fool\\") that recognizes there is much still to learn not only in one's major field but also in all those other areas (and relationships) of one's life this side of death.  Therefore, one must surrender to one's teacher(s) and the demands of one's discipline(s) just as one surrenders (a type of metaphysical \\"death,\\" samurai style, that conquers fear) one's hard-earned  proficiency occasionally in order to reach higher levels of proficiency (symbolic of \\"life\\").  True wisdom is in humility where life progresses through death.<br />Integral to the two dimensions of mastery mentioned above are the internal and external,  metaphysical (mental, emotional, spiritual) and physical, dimensions which must be kept in balance, and Mr. Leonard provides various keys and tools for doing just that.  Although he is far from exhaustive in his exposition on what it means to be \\"successful,\\" he does provide some valuable insights on the key principles of mastery underlying true success that are rarely found in a lot of popular success literature.

He states in his introduction that his new book is \\"intended for individual or small group study,\\" therefore, each of the first nine chapters ends with discussion questions to encourage exploration and  understanding of the concepts presented.  Although the book is more streamlined and formatted differently than the other two, no significant building on the concepts already presented in the other books is attempted.  As I've indicated in my other reviews, I think Punt's Calvinism will be an obstacle to the more perceptive Arminians and non-Calvinists who find Punt's view otherwise insightful (like myself) because his Calvinism implies an unconditional bad news or divine reprobation of those not unconditionally elect in Christ which militates against the positive aspects of his view.  Although Punt calls his view \\"Biblical Universalism,\\" he qualifies it to the point of reducing it to a Calvinistic generalism.  Although I reject Punt's Calvinism, I've learned much from him and other Calvinists (so much so that I no longer consider myself an \\"Arminian\\").  I consider him a significant contributor to the current debate among Arminians (A), Calvinists (C) and non-A/Cs, although he appears to be little known or ignored among the major contributors (Sproul, Corner, Geisler, White, Vance, Hunt, etc.).<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with Biblical Universalism (BU), Punt offers the following: \\"BU is the teaching that all persons are elect in Christ except those who the Bible expressly declares will be finally lost, namely, those who ultimately reject or remain indifferent to whatever revelation God has given of himself to them whether in nature/conscience or in gospel presentation.  Biblical Universalism is based on three biblical facts: 1) the so-called `universalistic' texts speak of a certain-to-be-realized salvation as Calvinists have consistently maintained, and they do so in terms of all persons as Arminians have always affirmed.  2) All persons, except Jesus Christ, are liable for and polluted by the imputed sin of Adam (original sin).  However, the Scriptures do not teach or imply that anyone is consigned to eternal damnation solely on the basis of their sin in Adam apart from actual, willful, and persistent sin on the part of the person so consigned.  3) We must accept the so-called `universalistic' texts as written.  We may allow only those exceptions that are necessarily imposed upon these passages from the broader context of the Scriptures as a whole\\" (pg. 83).<br /><br />Although Punt doesn't believe the Scriptures teach that anyone is consigned to eternal damnation solely on the basis of their sin in Adam, his Calvinism strongly implies that the \\"actual, willful, and persistent sin\\" of the one eternally damned is unavoidable and/or inevitable because, according to Punt, \\"no one conceived and born in sin has the capacity within himself or herself to choose the good\\"  (pgs. 60 - 61).  This means original sin (which is actual, not potential) will irresistibly cause the sin that damns those to hell who are not elect in Christ.  Calling it \\"actual, willful, and persistent\\" sin doesn't relieve this cold, hard Calvinistic fact.onscience or in gospel presentation.

But Hummel introduced it in a Christian and Biblical context where God's Will and Word take precedence in determining what's important.  This resource is a simple introduction to time management using the following four steps: decide what's important, discover how one's time is now being spent, budget the hours and follow through.  Each step is given some exposition.  If one already has Hummel's newer book &quot;Freedom from Tyranny of the Urgent,&quot; then this booklet isn't necessary since it is essentially incorporated into the book.  But for those Christians who have an initial adversity to the whole concept of time management and scheduling and don't see how it is integral to discipleship or produces greater freedom rather than bondage, this booklet may make you reconsider your belief.  For those who want more insight into time and life management from a Christian perspective, read Ken Smith's &quot;It's About Time.&quot;  Hummel is one of many who recommends it.	2002-05-23

I expect to show that if we would know the power of the Christian message our nature must be invaded by an Object from beyond it; that That which is external must become internal; that the objective Reality which is God must cross the threshold of our personality and take residence within.\\"  Tozer is against the popular notion that \\"theological assent\\" (which some call `faith') \\"is all that is required to make Christians.\\"  He is against the idea that merely learning the Word of God, and even assenting to its truths, is all that one needs to be a Christian apart from a holy, dynamic, and life-changing discipleship via the Holy Spirit to the Living Word, Jesus Christ.  Tozer would probably lean towards the position of men like John MacArthur, James M. Boice, and Dallas Willard regarding the Lordship salvation controversy, especially Willard's position as expounded in his book \\"The Divine Conspiracy\\" (see especially his chapter titled \\"The Gospels of Sin Management\\").  See, for example, Chapter 2 (In Word, or in Power) in The Divine Conquest.  Tozer here takes exception to those who say that \\"A Christian is not morally better than a sinner, the only difference is that he has taken Jesus, and so he has a Savior.\\"  Tozer responds: \\"I trust it may not sound flippant to inquire, `A savior from what?'  If not from sin and evil conduct and the old fallen life, then from what?  And if the answer is, From the consequences of past sins and from judgment to come, still we are not satisfied.  Is justification from past offenses all that distinguishes a Christian from a sinner?  Can a man become a believer in Christ and be no better than he was before?  Does the gospel offer no more than a skillful Advocate to get guilty sinners off free at the day of judgment?\\"  Tozer's answer is an emphatic \\"No!\\"<br />What about the so-called \\"mystics\\" that Tozer lists in his preface as some of his mentors to desiring \\"the better way\\"?  I can only conclude that Tozer considers himself in their company as living the `essential interiority of true religion'.  Tozer thinks that the dividing line today (in his day and ours) is between what he calls \\"evangelical rationalists\\" and \\"evangelical mystics\\".  What does he mean?  Here's another quote: \\"There is today an evangelical rationalism which is the same doctrine held by the Jewish religion in the day of Jesus.  They said the truth is in the word, and if you want to know truth, go to the rabbi and learn the word.  If you get the word, you have the truth.  That is also the view of evangelical rationalism in our day: 'If you learn the text you've got the truth!' This evangelical rationalism will kill the truth just as quickly as liberalism will, though in a more subtle way.  The evangelical rationalist wears our uniform but he insists that the body of truth is all you need.  Believe the body of truth and you are on your way to heaven and you cannot backslide and you will get a crown in the last day!  I believe the Bible is a living book, a revelation from God.  But there must be illumination before revelation can get to your soul.  It is not enough that I hold an inspired book in my hands - I must have an inspired heart.  Truth has a soul as well as a body!\\" (\\"Renewed Day by Day: A Daily Devotional\\", Feb 28 entry)<br />The mystics that Tozer states he learned from are: Nicholas Herman (a.k.a., Brother Lawrence) whose work \\"The Practice of the Presence of God\\" is a renowned classic;  Nicholas of Cusa, author of \\"On Learned Ignorance\\" and other mystical treatises (See his Selected Spiritual Writings in the Classics of Western Spirituality series); Frederick Faber, author of \\"The Creator and the Creature\\" among other works; Meister Eckhart who is considered a heavyweight in mysticism (see translations of his works by McGinn and Walshe); Fenelon, a French mystic & friend of Madame Guyon; and Cambridge Platonist John Smith, author of Select Discourses (1660).  I have major works by all of these mystical writers and sought them out because of the impact they had on Tozer who had an impact on me.ohn Smith, author of Select Discourses (1660).

In the preface to Punt's other book, he refers readers to \\"Unconditional Good News\\" (1980) for details regarding his comparison of some of the classical exegesis done by many Christian scholars over hundreds of years on the topic of salvation. Although the newer book is broader in scope and contains additional information (but fewer pages), the two books compliment each other and should be read together. Punt's \\"new insight\\" was taken from a statement by Princeton Theologian Charles Hodge who interpreted Romans 5:18 as allowing for the salvation of all who die in infancy. Hodge stated in his Systematic Theology: \\"All the descendants of Adam, except Christ, are under condemnation; all the descendants of Adam, except those of whom it is expressly revealed that they cannot inherit the kingdom of God, are saved.\\" Punt, like Hodge, rejects the doctrine of absolute universalism which affirms that everybody will ultimately be saved and nobody damned. But one must also keep in mind that Punt, like Hodge, is a Calvinist and his \\"Biblical Universalism\\" is Calvinistic. It doesn't allow for the possibility of forfeiting election or salvation and therefore rejects the idea that any who enter hell were once elect in Christ or even regenerated.  Calvinism underlies Punt's \\"Premise B\\": All persons are elect in Christ EXCEPT those who the Bible expressly declares will be finally lost, namely, those who ultimately reject or remain indifferent to whatever revelation God has given of himself to them whether in nature/conscience or in gospel presentation.  Notice that premise B does NOT say that all persons are elect in Christ UNTIL they forfeit that election by remaining indifferent to whatever revelation God has given of himself to them.<br /><br />According to Punt, those who receive damnation were never unconditionally elect in Christ although, apparently, they (along with all those who are elect in Christ) were unconditionally made sinners via Adam and placed by God under condemnation before they ever came into existence.  Punt's Calvinism holds that ALL of Adam's descendants, except Christ, are unconditionally under sin and condemnation, but only SOME of Adam's descendants are unconditionally elect in Christ thereby breaking the universal and unconditional application of the biblical parallel.  Punt doesn't believe that ALL who are unconditionally under condemnation in Adam are also unconditionally elect in Christ because he thinks that this would lead to absolute universalism. But it only leads to absolute universalism if, as Punt's Calvinism demands, election (and salvation) can't be forfeited.  Punt believes that SOME of Adam's descendants were NEVER elect in Christ, even when they were infants, although he personally believes that all who die in infancy are part of the elect.  He doesn't allow for election unto salvation to be unconditionally given to all of Adam's descendants which is then conditionally and freely forfeited by some (just as Adam was graciously given the Paradise of Eden but freely forfeited it).  Since Punt's \\"unconditional good news\\" isn't really applicable to ALL of Adam's descendants, it therefore reduces to a Calvinistic \\"Generalism\\" that strongly implies an unconditional divine reprobation of those not unconditionally elect in Christ.  The only way Punt can escape this implication, and at the same time escape absolute universalism (the final salvation of all), is to embrace the doctrine that election in Christ, like election in Adam, is unconditionally given to ALL of Adam's descendants and then later volitionally forfeited by some.  This \\"Neo-Puntian\\" revision of Biblical Universalism requires both Arminians and Calvinists to abandon their respective views that only SOME are elect in Christ although the idea that all who eventually enter heaven are elect in Christ can be maintained.  Arminianswill also need to revise their doctrine that allows for the possibility of forfeiting salvation only after regeneration occurs to allow for the idea that all who enter hell have forfeited their election in Christ, even if some were never regenerated.  How is election forfeited?  Through avoidable willful sin that's unrepentant and therefore unpardonable, not through original sin.lso need to revise their doctrine that allows for the possibility of forfeiting salvation only after regeneration occurs to allow for the idea that all who enter hell have forfeited their election in Christ, even if some were never regenerated.

US	52496001	R1DQGBT79GW0NL	0333563824	328235618	Evil and the Mystics' God: Towards a Mystical Theodicy (Library of Philosophy and Religion)	Books	3	5	5	N	N	A Fascinating Attempt at Developing a Mystical Theodicy	The author, Michael Stoeber, states in his introduction that theodicies aren't usually associated with mysticism because it is generally perceived that mystics ignore, downplay or deny the reality of evil.  However, Stoeber believes that some  \\"mystics\\" (or \\"mystical thinkers\\" such as Eckhart, Dostoevsky, Boehme, Evelyn Underhill, and Aurobindo, among others) provide provocative responses to the challenge of evil that not only go further than traditional non-mystical theodicies but also overcome many of their related problems.  On the insights of such mystical thinkers he hopes to lay a solid foundation for \\"a mystical theodicy\\".  The book is divided into two parts: Non-Mystical Theodicy and Mystical Theodicy.  The first part defines theodicy and proposes a positive or affirmative consolatory aspect that Stroeber thinks is often neglected in traditional theodicy which emphasizes the defensive component.  Stroeber then explores the following four theodical themes: the teleological, retributive, free-will, and aesthetic and argues for the first as the only coherent move for theodicy where the other themes are only effective as subordinated to it.  Gottfried Liebniz, author of \\"Theodicy,\\" is used as the primary representative of non-mystical teleological theodicies.  (From Leibniz came the three categories of evil popularly used today: the metaphysical, physical, and moral.)  Criticisms of such theodicies from Voltaire, Hume, Kant, and Dostoevsky (which include an emphasis on dysteleological evils) are discussed in order to pave the way for Stoeber's \\"mystical\\" tailoring of John Hick's soul-making theodicy.  According to Stoeber, the most significant influences on his book are Hick's \\"Evil and the God of Love\\" and Dostoevsky's \\"The Brothers Karamazov.\\"<br /><br />Theodicy presupposes theism, and Stoeber understands that the problem of evil arises out of it (and more acutely so for classical theism).  But since he is concerned with natural, rather than scriptural, theology, a liberal rather than conservative evangelical stance controls his exploration.  He also introduces and defends ideas (e.g., an emanative view of creation; rebirth [or reincarnation]; rejection of everlasting punishment in Hell in favor of annihilation [thereby rejecting Hick's universalism]) that, he admits, are unorthodox from the traditional theistic standpoint.  This weakens the tension between the problem of evil and theism by redefining the latter in unorthodox ways since the problem is most acute with a traditional understanding of God and its corresponding eschatology of Heaven and Hell.  Although Stoeber mentions in passing that Eckhart held to a type of \\"panentheism\\" (see pg. 108), he doesn't see the need to re-classify his own eclectic mystical theodicy as a \\"panentheodicy\\" or \\"process theodicy\\" and seems oblivious to modern proponents of a bi-polar panentheism such as Whitehead and Hartshorne who seem to have more ideas in common with his position than traditional theists.  It is also questionable whether Stoeber has escaped some of the contemporary criticisms  by traditional theistic apologists (Norman Geisler, David Clark, Winfried Corduan, etc.) of the apologetic value of mystical experiences.  Although there is a practical value in consolatory mystical experiences, it is questionable whether such experiences can be called theodical \\"evidence\\" or \\"justification\\" in any rational and objective sense.  Stoeber seems inconsistent when he says on page 4 that mystical theodicies such as those of Dostoevsky and Eckhart offer \\"a practical consolation and rational response to the skeptic that are much stronger than we find in non-mystical theodicies\\" but then on page 138 points out that mystical experience does NOT give an intelligible explanation to account for the suffering of the innocent, only non-rational consolation.  I sympathize with his concern for making moral sense of THIS life and its evils without arbitrarily negating it in terms of an afterlife of an entirely different nature.  But he raises more questions than he satisfactorily answers.  Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed his book and share his admiration for Dostoevsky's \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\".an entirely different nature.

It is 103 pages of text with an additional 8-page biography of the author, J. Heinrich Arnold.  The eighteen chapter titles are as follows:  The Struggle, Temptation, Deliberate Sin, The Will, The Power of Suggestion, Autosuggestion, Fascination, Suppression, Faith, Self-Surrender, Confession, Prayer, Detachment, Repentance and Rebirth, Healing, Purification, The Cross, and Living for the Kingdom.  Arnold perceptively sees the distinction between our sinful nature and our will, but is also aware of the latter's inability to overcome sin without God's grace.  He writes: \\"It is impossible to defeat one's sinful nature by will power alone, because the will is never wholly free, but bent this way and that by conflicting emotions and other forces at work on it.\\"  Thomas Kelly, in his classic \\"A Testament of Devotion\\" says it this way: \\"`I will' spells not obedience.\\"  This is because obedience comes through submission of our will to God, not independent exertion of it.  It is as we walk in submission to the Holy Spirit that we overcome the lusts of the flesh (Galatians 5:16) and bear fruits of righteousness.  Although some theologians or authors make distinctions or use terms differently than others, one can benefit from a comparative analysis of Arnold's book in relation to others on the same or similar topics.  Although such comparative analysis isn't an emphasis in this work, Arnold does incorporate insights from other authors such as Bonhoeffer, Pascal, Eckhart, the Swiss-French psychiatrist Charles Baudouin, and his father.<br />Through my studies I've come to distinguish (contrary to some) between what I call unconscious, conscious, and willful sins.  The first involves sins of character and attitude that we are not yet aware of in ourselves and include \\"sins of ignorance\\".  The second, usually considered synonymous with the third by some, involves becoming conscious of what was previously unconscious for the purpose of repentance.  It also includes our awareness of our sinful nature that produces internal temptations (via sinful desires) that we can overcome through our  submission to the Holy Spirit.  Arnold, in Chapter II, states that \\"temptation is not sin\\" (pg. 10).  I would qualify this by saying that all temptation is sin, but not sin from the one being tempted.  I believe this was Arnold's point since some Christians condemn themselves for being tempted.  Our sinful nature \\"tempts\\" us internally and contributes to any external temptation, but we are not to deliberately fulfill its sinful desires.  What I call \\"willful sin\\" equates, more or less, to what Arnold calls \\"deliberate\\" sin and involves our deliberate refusal to submit to God and the moral light he gives us both in our conscience and in His Word, the Bible.  I personally think that willful sin should be distinguished from our sinful nature (ref. Romans 7:20 in context) and its lusts.  To help others understand my distinction between conscious and willful sin, I point out that all willful sin is conscious (choosing sin knowing it is sin) but not all conscious sin is willful, but the definition of each category needs refinement.  Other books discussing sin and holiness that warrant a comparative analysis with this one and, in some ways, complement and reinforce its points, include such classics as: \\"Sin and Temptation: The Challenge of Personal Godliness\\" by John Owen, edited by James Houston; \\"A Serious Call to a Devout & Holy Life\\" by William Law; \\"Introduction to the Devout Life\\" by Francis de Sales; \\"Purity of Heart\\" by Soren Kierkegaard; and \\"Holy Living and Holy Dying\\" by Jeremy Taylor.

The editors of this work were painfully aware of this problem, but took into consideration the interests and opinions of their readers when revising and updating this anthology.  Those who have the first edition, like myself, will notice that some authors were replaced with others (the editors explain the selection process in the Preface).  The first edition included French spiritual writers Fenelon, Guyon and Marie of the Incarnation, as well as Maximus the Confessor, William Law, and Henri Le Saux, the first three omitted because of a lack of response and the last three omitted because of a general lack of recognition.  Those that were added this time around include Francis and Clare of Assisi, Francis de Sales, Jeanne de Chantal, and Evelyn Underhill.  Those that remained include: Origen, Gregory of Nyssa, Augustine of Hippo, Pseudo-Dionysius, Bernard of Clairvaux, Bonaventure, Meister Eckhart, Jan van Ruusbroec, Gregory Palamas, Julian of Norwich, the unknown author of The Cloud of Unknowing, Catherine of Siena, Ignatius of Loyola, Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross, Jonathan Edwards, Therese of Lisieux, and Thomas Merton.<br />The General Introduction is concise, clear and well-balanced.  It notably rejects the perspective that sees mysticism as the essence of all religion (the \\"perennial philosophy\\" or \\"universal mystical religion\\" view) while, at the same time, affirming that a mystical element belongs to the very essence of religion, along with other elements (one is reminded of Friedrich von Hugel's masterpiece on mysticism).  Christianity is recognized as distinct from other theistic and non-theistic (pagan) religions.  Yet, it is noted that interaction between the various belief systems has influenced Christian theology in general and Christian mysticism in particular.<br />This is an excellent, one-of-a-kind anthology.  Each spiritual writer is given a fine introduction, followed by an extended excerpt or two from one or more of their literary masterpieces.  Many of the excerpts are taken from Paulist Press' The Classics of Western Spirituality series.  Each spiritual writer is given a separate Selected Bibliography, divided into Texts (Edition Used, Other Sources) and Studies.  For a general introduction to other Christian mystics, see Ursula King's Christian Mystics.  Bernard McGinn's The Presence of God series on Western Christian mysticism provides a more in-depth analysis.  See especially his first book, The Foundations of Mysticism.  McGinn considers Sidney Spencer's Mysticism in World Religions (OP) as one of the more successful overviews of mysticism in the various world religions.  Less successful anthologies include Happold's Mysticism and Huxley's The Perennial Philosophy.

The Intro. and first chapter provide a short,  informal, and, some would say, questionable \\"history\\" of hermetic philosophy in general and \\"The Kybalion\\" in particular. The meaning of the term \\"Kybalion,\\" we are told, has been lost through time although the hermetic philosophy within it remains intact.  (Is it coincidental that the term sounds a bit like \\"Kaballah\\"?)  If William Walker Atkinson (WWA) was, as some think, the author (or a co-author) of the \\"Kybalion\\" (distinct from its hermetic content), it wouldn't be surprising given some of the content of the book.  WWA not only familiarized himself with occult & Eastern philosophy, esp. Hinduism, but also with New Thought (NT) metaphysics (including Christian Science).  NT (a.k.a. \\"mental science\\") and occult magic have similar roots, and both are concerned with the power of the human mind as it relates to the Divine Mind.  The author(s), however, consider(s) the modern metaphysical practitioners \\"quite ignorant\\" of the philosophy upon which their work is based, unlike the ancient Hermetic masters (pgs. 48 - 49).  Theologians are also considered ignorant as well (pgs. 57 - 58).<br /><br />The first hermetic principle of Mentalism is foundational and provides the universal monistic (albeit multi-level) medium through which all of the other principles operate.  It is the principle which ontologically unites each individual (and neophyte) to The All, the Substantial Reality (which some call \\"deity\\"), and empowers the Art of Mental Transmutation (i.e., \\"Magic\\") that begins with transmuting basic and ordinarily-called \\"mental\\" conditions but, through practice, evolves into transmutation of \\"physical\\" conditions as well.  See Chapter III.  Don't get hung up on the author(s)' equivocal use of terms.  \\"All is mental,\\" yet there are three general planes: spiritual, mental, and physical.  So, in one (nonspatially \\"higher\\") sense, the physical is mental... and spiritual, yet in another (\\"lower\\") sense, it isn't.  Taxonomically confusing?  Perhaps, but the law of non-contradiction isn't one of the stated hermetic principles, so don't be surprised if it seems to war against the first & fourth principles.  The author(s) \\"reconcile(s)\\" the apparent contradiction (or \\"Divine Paradox\\") between the One and many, Infinite and finite, Absolute and relative, Spirit and matter, Real and illusory, etc. by the use of higher & lower \\"planes,\\" \\"truths,\\" \\"laws,\\" etc. along with the principle of polarity (see Chs. V, VI & X).  Although monism (or pantheism) seems to be denied in Chs. IV & V, the principle of polarity assumes a bi-polar, multi-level version of it: \\"THE ALL and The Many are the same(!), the difference being merely a matter of degree of Mental Manifestation\\" (pg. 150).  The planes are hierarchical and corresponding, and every \\"thing\\" within each plane vibrates.  Also, each vibrating \\"thing\\" is bi-polar with a positive & masculine pole and a negative & feminine pole with a rhythmic, compensating swing between the poles (think Yin Yang).  One of the desired goals is to overcome the negative swing (esp. in regards to one's emotions, moods, mental states).  In order to do this, one must \\"neutralize\\" it from a higher plane with a higher law by the Art of Attention (concentration) via the Will.  The game is over when The All draws \\"back into itself all of its creations\\" thereby making one omniscient, knowing \\"the Whole Truth of being At One with THE ALL\\" (pgs 75 - 76)... at least until the next \\"Grand Cycle of Aeons\\" starts the process all over again (per the Oscillating Theory of the Universe).<br /><br />To understand how not-so-ignorant Christian philosophers handle the paradoxes of monism and pantheism, see \\"Apologetics in the New Age\\" by Norman Geisler and David Clark.See also Materialist & Druid Isaac Bonewits's \\"Real Magic\\" which contains around 26 laws of magic.

US	52496001	RHVIEEI1DBJ93	0801063442	476669953	The Word-Faith Controversy: Understanding the Health and Wealth Gospel	Books	4	62	68	N	N	An Important Contribution to the Word-Faith Controversy	This is the best critical analysis of the Word of Faith (or Word-Faith) movement to date.  Bowman, a non-charismatic, shows an acute awareness of the pertinent issues and seems familiar with not only the primary literature and tapes of the Word-Faith proponents but also it's critics and counter-critics (e.g., Bruno, DeArteaga, & Spencer).  Contrary to the primary critics of the movement such as Hanegraaff, McConnell and Hunt, Bowman feels that the movement has its roots in the evangelical faith-cure movement of the late nineteenth century, not the metaphysical cults (New Thought, Christian Science, etc.).  Nonetheless, he does qualify this by stating that \\"the possibility exists that the evangelical faith-cure movement and early Pentecostalism were also influenced in some respects by meta-physical thought\\" (pg. 82), although he leaves this possibility relatively unexplored in the book.  Interestingly, contemporary New Thought authors Anderson & Whitehouse, in their book \\"New Thought: A Practical American Spirituality\\" (1995), also note the similar interest in healing between their movement and the evangelical faith-cure movement and, like Bowman (but unlike some critics), recognize the differences in world views (pantheism vs. Christian theism).  It is also worth noting that they state that most of the leaders of the major New Thought groups existing today came from Traditional Christian backgrounds which didn't meet their needs, especially for healing.  Apparently both movements expanded their interests to include not only physical health but also overall well-being and success (including wealth).  From the evangelical faith-cure movement came the 20th century's Pentecostal & Charismatic movements, which included a revival of supernatural charismatic gifts, including speaking in other tongues (unknown languages) by the Holy Spirit.<br /><br />Bowman considers E. W. Kenyon to be the grandfather, not father, of the Word-Faith (W-F) movement because he considers it to be essentially a Pentecostal movement since the W-F movement's primary \\"father\\", Kenneth Hagin, was Pentecostal, unlike Kenyon (but he also considers William Branham and Oral Roberts to be contributing \\"fathers\\" to the W-F movement in various ways).  He also thinks that Hagin contributed certain doctrines to the movement that Kenyon didn't teach.  Bowman thinks the W-F movement is an extreme Pentecostalism, or a Pentecostalism \\"at it's worst\\".  One must keep in mind, however, that there are various definitions of what constitutes \\"Pentecostal\\" and \\"Charismatic\\".  Technically, the former is applied strictly to those who believe that speaking in other tongues is the sole \\"initial evidence\\" of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit.  In other words, if one doesn't speak in tongues, then one HASN'T been baptized in the Holy Spirit.  This is the position of classical Pentecostal denominations such as the Assemblies of God (A/G), the largest Pentecostal denomination in the world.  Those who reject this position but still believe that speaking in tongues is for today, along with the other charismatic gifts of the Spirit, are generally categorized as \\"Charismatic\\".  Kenneth Hagin was once affiliated with the A/G, but left the denomination to become independent or non-denominational.  Although Hagin is a classical Pentecostal, I personally don't think that the \\"initial evidence\\" position of Hagin is integral to the W-F movement & its theology.  There are many in the W-F movement that are Charismatic, not Pentecostal.  Bowman occasionally uses a broader definition of \\"Pentecostal\\" than the more technical definition related to the \\"initial evidence\\" position which he considers a \\"hard-line view\\" (pg. 62), rejected by such men as F. F. Bosworth, author of \\"Christ the Healer\\".<br /><br />Bowman considers the W-F views on healing and prosperity to be the least problematic aspects of their theology (pg. 11), but I tend to think that their distinctive theology was formulated to reinforcethe movement's views on healing and prosperity.  The doctrines of healing and prosperity as available in this life through \\"faith\\" are the \\"positive\\" motivating force of the movement regardless of the distinctive aberrant theology just as they are the thrust of the New Thought movement with its \\"positive\\" message regardless of its pantheism and/or panentheism.  It is not surprising that the New Thought authors noted above consider Norman Vincent Peale and Robert Schuller as promoters of some of New Thought's ideas on positive/possibility thinking although neither Peale nor Schuller is a pantheist or even a Pentecostal or Charismatic.views on healing and prosperity.

However, I consider the title somewhat misleading given the author's stated purpose for the book as disclosed in chapter one: &quot;...this is a book from which readers may learn to apply the principles of Zen, as reflected in the martial arts, to their lives and thus open up a potential source of inner strength they may never have dreamt they possessed&quot; (pg. 3). It appears that he learned about Zen through his experience with the martial arts and, through this book, is attempting to give Zen a broader application so that one can reap some general metaphysical benefits from Zen without ever becoming a martial artist or even a Zen Buddhist. The author notifies the reader in chapter one that this book isn't for those who wish to master either Zen or the amazing physical feats of more advanced martial artists. The book is for those (martial artists or not) who want a simple, general introduction to the spiritual/mental side of the martial arts for broader applications. This approach has its critics since some may think that he superficially covers Zen's application to the martial arts in his attempt to give it a broader application. This book does not expound in detail the philosophy and/or religion of Zen Buddhism although it does contain some practical concepts related to Zen and life in general.  One doesn't have to be a Buddhist or martial artist to appreciate the practical wisdom he shares, but if one wants more details regarding either Zen Buddhism or the martial arts, one is better served looking elsewhere.	2001-10-24

All three are great books in their own right and supplement each other and should be read together as the author intended.  Also, Willard's books are good complimentary companions to those by Richard Foster, especially his \\"Celebration of Discipline\\" and \\"Prayer: Finding The Heart's True Home.\\"  In fact, in \\"The Spirit of the Disciplines,\\" Willard refers readers to \\"Celebration of Discipline\\" for more practical application of the disciplines since his book's main thrust is to provide a practical theology of the spiritual disciplines which he felt was lacking in contemporary Christian literature.  Another good book on the spiritual disciplines is \\"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life\\" by Donald S. Whitney which takes into consideration Willard's and Foster's insights and adds a few of its own, including the important one that \\"meditation is the missing link between Bible intake and prayer.\\"  I also consider spiritual mentoring to be important and I've found the book by Randy Reese and Keith Anderson entitled \\"Spiritual Mentoring: A Guide for Seeking and Giving Direction\\" to be very useful in this regard.  Reese and Anderson also value the wisdom of the Christian spiritual masters of old, as do Foster and Willard, and saturate their book with their insights.<br />Willard's thrust in this book is to emphasize and expound the vital importance of the spiritual disciplines to the Christian life and to clear away popular misconceptions of them.  In the preface, he says: \\"My central claim is that we CAN become like Christ by doing one thing - by following him in the overall style of life he chose for himself.  If we have faith in Christ, we must believe that he knew how to live.  We can, through faith and grace, become like Christ by practicing the types of activities he engaged in, by arranging our whole lives around the activities he himself practiced in order to remain constantly at home in the fellowship of his Father.\\"  He continues: \\"What activities did Jesus practice?  Such things as solitude and silence, prayer, simple and sacrificial living, intense study and meditation upon God's Word and God's ways, and service to others.  Some of these will certainly be even more necessary to us than they were to him, because of our greater or different need.  But in a balanced life of such activities, we will be constantly enlivened by `The Kingdom Not of This World' - the Kingdom of Truth as seen in John 18:36 - 37.\\"  We must go beyond asking \\"What would Jesus do?\\" to practicing what Jesus practiced.  \\"Following `in his steps' cannot be equated with behaving as he did when he was `on the spot.'  To live as Christ lived is to live as he did all his life.\\"<br />Some of the misconceptions he exposes, as they relate to practicing the spiritual disciplines, include the denigration of the physical body and confusing it with the fallen human nature, and the elevation of poverty as a virtue and denigration of wealth as a vice.  He takes exception to some of the ascetic practices of some of the early Christian monks who went so far as to abuse their bodies.  He also states: \\"to withhold our bodies from religion is to exclude religion from our lives\\" (pg. 30).  Spiritual life is the body's fulfillment.  He also respectfully disagrees with such notables as John Wesley and Alastair MacIntyre who more or less see the rich as destined for Hell.  Additionally, he argues that salvation is not JUST forgiveness, as popularly taught today, but a new order of life (which includes forgiveness).  He expounds more on this disagreement in his book \\"The Divine Conspiracy\\" and there takes exception to theologians such as Charles Ryrie.  This disagreement is one of the contemporary controversial issues (not only among Arminians and Calvinists but even among those who believe in \\"eternal security\\" or \\"once-saved, always-saved\\") and involves the relationship of faith and obedience in a true (not just professing) Christian's life.  Willard's position seems to be that discipleship and/or obedience to Christ is NOT optional but integral to what it means to be a Christian.  But this implies that a lack of discipleship to Christ (which includes a lack of some sort of spiritual discipline in one's life) means a lack of salvation.  This is what provokes debate since some see this as promoting the idea that we maintain our salvation by works, an idea that surely Willard would reject because it misunderstands his point about the relational aspect of salvation inherent in discipleship.  He sees two great omissions from Christ's great commission in the contemporary Church (that is, among those who profess to be Christians): 1) the omission of making disciples, and 2) the omission of the step of taking our converts through training that will bring them ever increasingly to do what Jesus directed (see Appendix II).  This book is intended as a biblical corrective to those omissions and I think it contributes admirably to that purpose.

US	52496001	R3JI7TODJBQYAT	0764221019	467731396	The Healing Power of the Christian Mind: How Biblical Truth Can Keep You Healthy	Books	5	19	21	N	N	A Biblical and Balanced Approach to the Topic	This book provides a biblical and balanced approach to an otherwise misunderstood and controversial topic: the healing power of the human mind.  Dr. Backus is aware of the misunderstandings, especially among Christians, that cloud the issue so he renders due cautions and clarifications during his exposition.  Although he believes that miracles and instant healings through prayer do happen today, he distinguishes between a supernatural healing (a miracle) which is entirely an act of God and the natural process of healing which involves our cooperating with God to create a healthy inner life based upon truth, especially and ultimately God's truth revealed in the Bible.  He disagrees with those Christians who think that God always wills the healing of our bodies here on earth and think that healing always happens if the person praying has \\"enough faith\\" (pg. 110).  These same Christians usually \\"see God's promise to preserve the health of his people, as recorded in Exodus and Deuteronomy, as a pledge to perform miracles routinely\\" and \\"think that by 'claiming' these promises they can unleash miracle-power as if by magic from heaven\\" (pg. 51).  Instead, Dr. Backus believes that \\"the Exodus and Deuteronomy promises assume that God's people will live in a relaxed state of trust - a state of inner peace and rest and obedience\\" (pgs. 51 - 52).<br /><br />Dr. Backus also distinguishes between spiritually unhealthy false religions (including New Age and Mind Science cults) and the scientific (and Biblical!) fact that \\"your health and your healing can be made better or worse by what you do with your mind\\" (pg. 63).  Regarding \\"positive thinking,\\" he asserts: \\"If you must choose between a positive thought and a true thought, always choose what is true.\\"  He adds: \\"Sometimes truth has a negative effect - angering us, causing grief, frightening us.  But the whole truth transforms those negatives into positives, because God turns evil into good.  When you tell yourself the whole truth you don't deny pain or illness, you defeat it\\" (pg. 129).  He gives examples of \\"illicit positive thinking\\" that deny reality and also gives examples of confronting negative reality with positive culmination (the \\"whole\\" biblical truth) that brings hope and can contribute to one's physical healing.  Dr. Backus clearly points out that \\"most diseases do not result from a single causal factor\\" and that \\"even so-called 'terminal' illnesses are not, in themselves, sufficient to cause death.  Nutrition, exercise, and rest make a significant difference, as does a sense of belonging to a group of other people\\" (pg. 53).  Also, renewing our minds with Christian truth as taught in the Bible promotes healing; hence, the (revised) title of the book: The Healing Power of a CHRISTIAN Mind.<br /><br />Although many of the health principles expounded in this book are natural and supported by scripture, Dr. Backus also promotes prayer and the possibility of supernatural healing from God.  I highly recommend this book.

But they also make the following important point: &quot;While some may be especially gifted for mentoring, spiritual mentoring is the work of the community of faith just as friendship belongs to all people&quot; (pg. 56).  Unlike traditional Western forms of instruction, spiritual mentoring is more intimate and requires the deeper practice of sharing one's way of life.  It is relational and autobiographical.  Two foundational pillars of the mentor-mentoree relationship are attraction and imitation.  But in establishing and cultivating such a relationship, listening, discernment, and purpose are important.  The authors expound on these aspects and reinforce them for both the mentor and mentoree through questions for reflection within each chapter.<br />The first two chapters discuss the importance of spiritual mentoring and broadly define what it is.  J. Robert Clinton's mentoring types are laid out and given more detail in Appendix One and his five dynamics of spiritual mentoring form the basis of the next five chapters of the book.  Clinton is the author of &quot;Leadership Emergence Theory&quot; (1989) and &quot;The Mentor Handbook: Detailed Guidelines and Helps for Christian Mentors and Mentorees&quot; (1991).  Appendix Four, Developing a Personal Time Line, is adapted from his earlier book.  The five dynamics of spiritual mentoring are: Attraction, Relationship, Responsiveness, Accountability, and Empowerment.<br />Seven classic Christian authors are used in conjunction with contemporary ones to &quot;provide a historically informed vision for the contemporary work of spiritual mentoring.&quot;  Appendix Three provides the historical time line for the classic authors.  Augustine (354 - 430) is introduced in Chapter 3 and challenges the mentor to &quot;attract them by your way of life.&quot;  In Chapter 4, Aelred of Rievaulx (1110 - 1167) provides insights into developing trust and intimacy in the mentoring relationship through &quot;Spiritual Friendship&quot;.  Spanish mystics Teresa of Avila (1515 - 1582) and John of the Cross (1542 - 1591) help us to cultivate a responsive humility in Chapter 5.  Teresa's book &quot;Interior Castle&quot; helps the mentor to guide the apprentice through the various stages of prayer which produce greater responsiveness to the Holy Spirit.  John's insights into the purifying &quot;dark night of the soul&quot; as it relates to self-denial are also discussed.  The authors note that &quot;spiritual responsiveness requires the step of purgation or purification&quot; (pg. 105) and &quot;when we focus on God we recognize our serious need for a purified heart&quot; (pg. 107).  In Chapter 6, we learn the importance of accountability through Ignatius of Loyola's (1491 - 1556) &quot;Spiritual Exercises&quot; and Chapter 7 leads us to the goal of spiritual mentoring: empowerment.  We are introduced to Julian of Norwich (1342 - 1416) and Jeanne Guyon (1648 - 1717) and learn from them that there is joyous empowerment through intimacy with God, identity as the beloved of God, and the discovery of our unique voice for kingdom service.  The five appendices are useful.  Appendix Two gives us contemporary definitions of spiritual mentoring from Thomas Merton, Richard Foster, Eugene Peterson, and others.  Appendix Five provides a nice recommended bibliography for spiritual mentoring.<br />Throughout this book I was reminded that the mentor, by his or her example, encourages the apprentice to follow, imitate, and learn from Master Jesus through both the Scriptures and the mentorship of the Holy Spirit.

I cannot help but love this man who loved his God and sacrificed all to commune with Him.  His difficult &quot;experiment&quot; of maintaining God-consciousness throughout each day is put into words that burn and smoke with a holy passion that touches the mystery of God.  Inner solitude and persistent meditation upon the divine produced an unconditional, unwavering love for others that motivated his work of education to the point that even though the labor was long and hard, it was worth it for he knew his God, the Creator of the Universe, was a Fellow Laborer.  The reciprocated love from the people, expressed in simple ways, was an extra gift.  One is blessed by Mr. Laubach's shared encounters with God's glory on Signal Hill, his reflections on those encounters, and the inspiring words that God spoke through his mouth.  The wisdom of humility adorns his thoughts, including those on suffering.  One learns that God is not indifferent to our suffering but actually suffers with us in Christ and through Christ overcomes it in love.  Hence, the significance of Easter and our ability to overcome by choosing Christ.  Does this remove the mystery?  No, for with Christ comes mystery, even the greatest mystery... but to reject Him brings despair.<br />This is a precious and unique book because Frank Laubach was just such an individual.  But he also knew that each one of us is precious and unique, and who better to recognize and eternally appreciate that fact than the One who made us that way?  That is the underlying and culminating message of these letters.  Intimate fellowship with God meets one of our deepest of human needs: to be loved for our uniqueness.  The closer we get to God, the more we will realize and lovingly appreciate how truly special each one of us really is.  Such fellowship, and the progressive insight it brings, is the essence of victorious living.  &quot;There is no defeat unless one loses God, and then all is defeat though it be housed in castles and buried in fortunes.&quot;  But to enjoy God and creatively love with, and through, Him forever... That, truly, is the glorious and beautiful meaning of existence.alize and lovingly appreciate how truly special each one of us really is.

US	52496001	R2SGMFFZO8MT8B	0824514807	487149293	New Thought: A Practical American Spirituality	Books	4	69	72	N	Y	A Valuable Introduction to New Thought Metaphysics	American philosopher William James, in his book &quot;Varieties of Religious Experience,&quot; called New Thought (NT) &quot;the religion of healthy-mindedness&quot; and considered it the American people's &quot;only decidedly original contribution to the systematic philosophy of life.&quot; The authors consider Phineas Parkhurst Quimby (1802 - 1866) to be the modern founder of the movement although some of the philosophical roots go all the way back to the idealism of ancient Greece.  Contemporaneous American influences include the transcendentalists, especially Ralph Waldo Emerson, who drank from the wells of eastern thought.  The movement's &quot;healthy-mindedness&quot; began with Quimby's interest in mesmerism as it related to physical healing, but expanded through time to include mental, financial, and interpersonal well-being and success.  Although the authors state that Quimby eventually rejected the idea, held by Franz Mesmer among others, of a subtle magnetic fluid that supposedly links all people and things together, it seems clear that he merely replaced it with the idea of &quot;spiritual matter, or fine interpenetrating substance, directly responsive to thought...&quot; (pg. 20).  Truth (or Divine Wisdom) is considered the real cure for all ills.  Through Warren Felt Evans and Emma Curtis Hopkins, the movement spread.  Mary Baker Eddy, a disciple of Quimby and founder of Christian Science (CS), is considered a diversion from the stream.  Eddy taught that &quot;there is no life, substance, or intelligence in matter.&quot;  But according to NT, matter is a part of God, not an illusion or error as taught by CS.<br />There are various New Thought denominations: Divine Science, Unity, Religious Science, and Seicho-No-Ie, among others.  The umbrella organization is the International New Thought Alliance.  The book notes that the founders of the various denominations, except the Japan-based Seicho-No-Ie, were from traditional Christian backgrounds which didn't meet their needs, especially for healing.  It is noteworthy that the same general interest during the nineteenth century in divine and/or faith healing that produced NT also led to the current Pentecostal and Charismatic movements within traditional Christianity.  Distinctions, however, are noted.  The authors also note differences between the theology of NT and that of traditional Christianity (as they perceive it) as well as differences between traditional (&quot;substance&quot;) New Thought and the more recent Process New Thought, which they promote.  They admit that traditional NT is more or less pantheistic and believe that the limitations of such a world view are overcome by the panentheism of Process New Thought.<br />Other discussions include the similarities and differences between NT and the New Age Movement (NAM), including the occult and magic.  They observe that both the NAM and NT have a growing interest in panentheism (as expounded by Whitehead and Hartshorne) but feel that the NAM is overly interested in occult trappings such as crystals, pyramids, magic, and the like.  They consider NT to be more mystically rather than magically (or psychically) inclined.  Also discussed is NT's position on ethics and evil. The authors state: &quot;...unlike Hinduism or Christian Science, it [NT] does not see evil as maya, illusion&quot;... &quot;Evil is good that is immature or misdirected.  It has no power of its own; it has only the power that our minds give to it...&quot; (pg. 50).  This follows from NT's idea that &quot;there is only one Presence and Power, and that power is good.&quot;  Regarding sin, they say: &quot;It is New Thought that understands that we are punished by our sins, not for them, and that by rising in consciousness we can contact the Divine Intelligence within, learn what we need to learn, and straighten out our thinking - and our lives&quot; (pg. 51).  Regarding ethics, the authors note the distinction between the shallow personality ethic and the more substantial character ethic and see the need to reemphasize the latter in New Thought.<br />Although I don't agree with the overall theology of New Thought, I consider this book essential to understanding the movement.  It has also provided valuable historical and philosophical links in my own research in areas only superficially covered or overlooked by the authors.  For example, the authors note that some self-professing Christians such as Norman Vincent Peale and Robert Schuller have incorporated NT principles into their teachings on positive thinking without adopting pantheism or panentheism.  Both Peale and Schuller have been criticized by other Christians for their views.  But neither is Pentecostal or Charismatic (P/C).  Within the P/C movements is another movement that the authors do not mention in their book and may not be aware of: The Word of Faith Movement.  This movement has some things in common (not necessarily all bad) with New Thought and is also criticized by other Christians, including some fellow P/C Christians.  For those who are interested, see the Dictionary of Pentecostal and Charismatic Movements in the book's bibliography.  In the areas of evil, ethics, and occultism, the authors provided superficial coverage.  Without giving too much detail, traditional Christianity's concepts of sin and evil are more complex.  Evil is seen more as &quot;spoiled goodness&quot; (C. S. Lewis) than immature or misdirected goodness, and includes the idea that at least some sin is intentional, not in ignorance, and deserving of punishment.  Punishment is integral to vicarious atonement.  The idea, however, that we are punished by our sins has a place too.  Also, an eschatological dimension is lacking in the book although NT implies a type of universalism (everybody will be saved) that denies hell and has much in common with the Unitarian Universalists (not mentioned in the book).  Reincarnation is usually promoted, but this also isn't mentioned.<br />The authors' attempt to distinguish NT from occultism and magic fails to see the deeper connection.  Like the authors, serious occultists shy away from the largely shallow New-Agers who are more into dabbling than discipline.  Also, Evelyn Underhill, in her massive book &quot;Mysticism,&quot; in the chapter entitled &quot;Mysticism and Magic,&quot; provides information on occult magic which parallels and links to New Thought metaphysics.  One of the key axioms of occult magic (or magick) is &quot;the existence of an imponderable medium or universal agent which is described as beyond the plane of our normal sensual perceptions yet interpenetrating and binding up the material world.&quot;  Sound familiar?  Remember the interpenetrating &quot;magnetic fluid&quot; and &quot;spiritual matter&quot;?  Well, occultists call it &quot;the astral light,&quot; among other names (akasha, ether, quintessence, etc.).  The second axiom of magic is &quot;the limitless power of the disciplined human will.&quot;  Ms. Underhill says: &quot;this dogma has been `taken over' without acknowledgment from occult philosophy to become the trump card of menticulture, `Christian Science,' and `New Thought.'&quot; Richard Cavendish, in his book &quot;A History of Magic,&quot; says: &quot;Mesmer was a powerful influence on the development of Spiritualism, Christian Science and the New Thought movement.  His significance for magic was that he appeared to have demonstrated the existence of a universal medium or force responsive to the human mind, which could employ it to affect the behavior of others.  For magicians this was a welcome gift and Eliphas Levi, the leading French magus of the nineteenth century, turned Mesmer's magnetic fluid into one of the bastions of modern magical theory.&quot;  There is certainly an overlap between mysticism and magic, but distinctions as well.  I've noticed the terms are used loosely by magicians.  Some divide magic into two general groups: high magic (theurgy) and low magic (thaumaturgy).  The former is sometimes associated with mysticism and spiritual progress whereas the latter is more concerned with strict wonder-working apart from any reference to salvation or sanctification.  The book doesn't get into any of this in any depth.  One of the best traditional Christian critiques of pantheism and panentheism and defenses of Christianity is Norman Geisler's Christian Apologetics.  One of the &quot;best&quot; expositions of New Thought metaphysics is &quot;In Tune With the Infinite&quot; by Ralph Waldo Trine.

In the introduction, Dave Hunt notes that Dr. Andrew Murray brought it back into print in 1896 under the present title (The Power of the Spirit) because he didn't &quot;know where to find anywhere else the same clear and powerful statement of the truth which the Church needs at the present day.&quot;  Murray also said: &quot;I have tried to read or consult every book I knew of that treats of the work of the Holy Spirit, and nowhere have I met with anything that brings the truth of our dependence upon the continual leading of the Spirit, and the assurance that that leading can be enjoyed without interruption, so home to the heart as the teaching of the present volume.&quot;  This is quite a statement!  Nonetheless, Hunt does note that, like Murray, he doesn't agree with all of Law's teachings (considering his entire writings) although he and Murray do believe that the message of this book on the Holy Spirit is soundly based upon Scripture.  William Law was a Protestant mystic who delved into many of the classics of Christian mysticism and eventually developed a particular interest in the Protestant mystic Jacob Boehme and later became known as one of his most prominent disciples.  Law is best known for his classic &quot;A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life&quot; which was treasured by such notables as John Wesley, George Whitefield, Samuel Johnson, and later, C. S. Lewis.  An unedited version of this classic, along with his work &quot;The Spirit of Love&quot;, is available in the Paulist Press series entitled &quot;The Classics of Western Spirituality.&quot;  Dave Hunt notes that although his edited version of Law's &quot;Address to the Clergy&quot; was taken primarily from Murray's edition, he has drawn upon several of Law's other books, including the afore mentioned classic.  Since I own the complete works of William Law, I had the privilege of comparing Hunt's version to the original.  There are definitely some notable changes and editing although I think it is safe to say that the heart of Law's book is certainly present in this edited, modern version which certainly is easier to read.<br />Law's emphasis is on the dynamic power of the Spirit in contrast to the stagnant, intellectualism that he found prevalent in his day (and which is, in certain circles, prominent today).  It is not enough to be doctrinally correct, to have skill in Greek and Hebrew, to belong to this or that denomination.  One must have a living relationship with God through His Spirit which defines what it means to have everlasting life.  This life is not defined by a past experience, but a present and ongoing personal walk with God which produces fruits of righteousness.  There is no place for Self in this spiritual walk, this divine-human relationship, which is defined as a submissive obedience to the Spirit's guidance.  The contrast between Self and the Spirit, the natural and the supernatural, is prominent in this book.  I must also add that Law's immersion in the Christian classics, including those penned by so-called mystics, is notable as well.  Take this from one who has read many of them.  Although I too don't agree with everything that Law wrote, I certainly enjoyed reading this work both in the original and in this easy-to-read and edited format.

The first part is comprised of six chapters.  The first chapter covers the recent history of Pentecostalism with its roots in the holiness movement and fundamentalism, the latter being subdivided into Protestant Orthodoxy and Evangelical Revivalism.  Also discussed are the characteristics of early Pentecostalism which includes, of course, the Baptism in the Spirit, and others such as a commitment to evangelism and missions, strong faith, premillennial expectancy, the reality of God's presence, enthusiastic worship, rich fellowship, and biblical authority.  The formation of Pentecostal denominations are also discussed, including the formation of the Assemblies of God, the largest Pentecostal denomination in the world.  Then the Charismatic Renewal is expounded on, including the &quot;Third Wave&quot; Charismatics, a term that was coined by Peter Wagner.  The on-going hermeneutical tension between classical Pentecostals and the larger Evangelical community, on the one hand, and the growing Charismatic community on the other, is noted and forms an important preface to the rest of the book.  The next three chapters discuss hermeneutics and how current Pentecostals see the need to argue for Luke's contribution to Pneumatology distinct from the apostle Paul since much of Pentecostal theology, with it's emphasis on empowerment through Spirit Baptism, derives principally from Luke's two texts, Luke and Acts.  The Menzies basically argue that &quot;Luke never attributes soteriological functions to the Spirit&quot; (like the apostle Paul does later in his writings) &quot;and that his narrative presupposes a pneumatology excluding this dimension (e.g., Luke 11:13; Acts 8:4 - 17; 19:1 - 7).&quot;  To put it positively, &quot;Luke describes the gift of the Spirit EXCLUSIVELY in charismatic terms as the source of power for effective witness&quot; (pg. 70).  Chapters 5 and 6 are exegetical replies to James Dunn and Max Turner, respectively.  In chapter 6, the Menzies further clarify their position of Luke's understanding of the gift of the Spirit by defining it as &quot;a prophetic enabling that empowers one for participation in the mission of God&quot; (pg. 89).  This has three main thrusts: &quot;the gift of the Spirit in Luke-Acts is nonsoteriological (or charismatic), prophetic, and missiological&quot; (pg. 89).  Each of these is expounded on.<br />In Part Two, Theological Affirmations, there are 9 chapters that expound on more specific Pentecostal concerns.  Chapter 7 covers the issue of subsequence, chapter 8, the issue of tongues as evidence, and chapter 9, the availability of tongues for all believers.  Chapter Ten, Signs and Wonders, addresses itself specifically to Third Wavers who generally consider Spirit Baptism as synonymous with conversion as do many non-Pentecostal Evangelicals.  Third Wavers are also known for their emphasis on signs and wonders.  The Menzies point out that Luke's perspective on divine enabling is much broader than the Third Wavers narrow focus on dramatic signs and includes the ability to bear bold witness for Christ in the face of persecution (pg. 153).  The authors also note Luke's wise and balanced look at signs and wonders.<br />Chapters 11 (Healing in the Atonement) and 12 (The Providence of God) seem to go together.  The former chapter defends the idea of healing in the atonement and does so by utilizing Gustaf Aulen's three approaches to understanding Christ's atonement (in his book &quot;Christus Victor&quot;): the classic view (aka, Christus Victor), the Latin (aka, forensic) view, and the liberal view.  Each view is seen as contributing to a full, biblical understanding of Christ's atonement.  In addition to this full-orbed view, three propositions are provided and expounded on in order to recognize that physical healing, like all the benefits of salvation, flow from the cross: 1) Jesusis Lord and Savior by virtue of his work on the cross (Rev. 5:9), 2) The salvation provided by Jesus as Lord and Savior is progressive in nature (2 Cor. 3:18), and 3) The salvation provided by Jesus as Lord and Savior is cosmic in nature and includes physical wholeness (Rom. 8:23; 1 Cor. 15:42 - 54).  Although chapter 11 is insightful, it doesn't really address in detail the controversial question of whether or not God wants all believers instantly healed provided they meet certain so-called biblical conditions (including faith) although the authors do strongly imply both here and in the next chapter (12) that the timing of physical healing (and the culmination of healing in general via the eschaton) is in the providential hands of God.  Chapter 12 is short but certainly gives food for thought regarding suffering and faith in general.  Chapter 13 discusses essential principles related to spiritual gifts, including the following: 1) gifts are not a badge of spiritual maturity (1 Cor. 12:4), 2) gifts are given so that we may edify others (1 Cor. 12:7), and 3) everyone has something to contribute (1 Cor. 12:11).  This chapter prepares one for what is revealed in the next chapter (14) regarding spiritual gifts and their relation to Spirit Baptism, Pentecostal style.  Chapter 14 challenges the classical Pentecostal notion that Spirit Baptism is the gateway to the gifts of the Spirit and notes that Third Wavers force classical Pentecostals to reassess their position on this subject.  The authors hold that although Spirit Baptism isn't the gateway to EVERY spiritual gift, it IS the gateway to a special cluster of gifts described by Paul as prophetic-type gifts that are associated with special revelation and inspired speech.  The last chapter (14) expounds on the role of Spirit baptism and the fruit of the Spirit and basically denies what many Pentecostals affirm: that Spirit Baptism is linked to spiritual maturity.  The Menzies note that the Corinthian church abolishes this assumption.  However, they do carefully note the &quot;co-relational&quot; (a term provided by John Carter) aspect, an idea I'll leave for readers to discover for themselves.<br />This book is on the cutting-edge of Pentecostal hermeneutics and is required reading for all those who consider themselves Pentecostal as well as those who think they have a good case against the Pentecostal position.

I have yet to find one book by Mr. Taylor that I haven't enjoyed and learned from.  He has a style of writing that I like.  Taylor's book is divided into two parts: 1) The Place of Discipline in Christian Living, and 2) The Path to Discipline in Christian Living.  The first part contains five chapters the first of which covers the value of discipline in general for the attainment of power, national as well as personal.  Chapter two discusses the marks of maturity in one's appetites, emotions, moods, speech, and priorities, and shows how we can adjust to authority.  Chapter three covers the perils of discipline such as the danger of extremes and unchristian asceticism.  Also included is an interesting discussion of &quot;undisciplined discipline&quot;.  Chapter four properly distinguishes and relates discipline and holiness and chapter five provides a defense of, and valuable insights into, imposed discipline.  Part Two is the whole of chapter six which tells us &quot;How to Become a Disciplined Person&quot; and provides many words of wisdom.  If I had to highlight one bit of wisdom from the book that sticks in my mind, it would be the importance of selection as the law of life (pg. 36).  Taylor says, in effect, that we cannot join everything, we cannot participate in every good cause, we cannot give to everything, we cannot go to every interesting concert or lecture or meeting, we cannot read everything,... therefore, we must select! That last part about reading really hit home, especially since I LOVE to read and don't have alot of time to do it.  Taylor expounds on this principle of selection as it relates to priorities and makes his points stick.<br />Other popular books on discipleship and the spiritual disciplines include the following: Celebration of Discipline by Richard Foster, The Spirit of the Disciplines by Dallas Willard, The Cost of Discipleship by Dietrich Bonhoeffer, The Discipline of Grace by Jerry Bridges, Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life by Donald Whitney, A Long Obedience in the Same Direction by Eugene Peterson, The Complete Green Letters by Miles Stanford, and, for those who like workbooks, the Navpress Colossians 2:7 Series on discipleship.scipleship by Dietrich Bonhoeffer, The Discipline of Grace by Jerry Bridges, Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life by Donald Whitney, A Long Obedience in the Same Direction by Eugene Peterson, The Complete Green Letters by Miles Stanford, and, for those who like workbooks, the Navpress Colossians 2:7 Series on discipleship.	2001-03-26

His opinion is obviously shared by many others as shown in Christianity Today's listing of &quot;Celebration of Discipline&quot; as one of the top twenty most influential books of the 20th century.  Why is the book so influential?  Because it gives Christians important and practical details regarding the scriptural key (self-discipline) to living a holy life which is the door to true liberty in all its facets.  The 12 spiritual disciplines he expounds on, if faithfully practiced, will lead to inward and outward harmony (wholeness; holiness) with oneself as well as social harmony with others both within and without (as an evangelistic light) the corporate body of Christ.  Four disciplines are allotted to each one of the spheres (inward, outward, and corporate) and valuable insights from the spiritual masters within Christian history are provided as supplements to the biblical foundation that grounds the book.<br />Another book that makes a nice companion to this one is Dallas Willard's &quot;The Spirit of the Disciplines.&quot;  Willard's book is highly recommended by Foster who considered it the book of the decade (1980s) and now considers Willard's new book &quot;The Divine Conspiracy&quot; as the one he has been searching for all his life because of its biblically comprehensive, holistic and practical nature.  Both Foster and Willard value the deep, spiritual insights of the older Christian classics (including those penned by so-called Christian &quot;mystics&quot;) as seen by their many references and quotes.  Also, both authors have seen that the deep spirituality that underlies those classics flowed from a self-disciplined life.  Those who think that God will progressively sanctify them apart from their obedient and disciplined life are sorely mistaken and, if they don't change their thinking and practices, are in for a rude awakening.<br />A few words regarding the spiritual discipline of meditation are in order.  Meditation in general involves learning through practice to control one's thoughts and redirect one's attention for the purpose of sustained concentration on a given object (whether physical via the eyes or mental via the imagination or spirit).  This is NOT always easy, especially at first, because our thoughts tend to be wild and bounce disjointedly from thought to thought in a stream of consciousness.  This is one reason why vocal prayer (which IS easy) is important during private prayer times to aid in concentration.  This is also important to understand in order to appreciate the purpose of repetition in, for example, Eastern Orthodox practice (read &quot;The Way of a Pilgrim&quot; and notice the anonymous author's use of the Jesus Prayer and its corresponding fruit in his life).  This is NOT &quot;vain&quot; repetition, but repetition with an important, sacred goal!  Having made this point, I appreciate Foster's emphasis on obedience.  He stated that &quot;Christian meditation, very simply, is the ability to hear God's voice and obey his word.&quot;  Obedience is indeed integral to Christian meditation and holy living because the Christian purpose of such a discipline is to sensitize us to the Holy Spirit's &quot;still, small&quot; voice.  I also appreciated Foster's balanced understanding of detachment and attachment.  He stated: &quot;The detachment from the confusion all around us is in order to have a richer attachment to God.&quot;  Amen!  I am glad to find myself in a growing company of Christians of various denominations who appreciate the importance of Foster's book and the greater importance of practicing the disciplines in order to live a &quot;devout and holy life&quot; (*) that is pleasing and acceptable to God.

This was probably because of its specialized and intellectually-advanced treatment of an otherwise popular subject: The New Age Movement (NAM).  The same thing happened to another valuable Christian book on the NAM by Tom Snyder called \\"Myth Conceptions: Joseph Campbell and the New Age\\" (Baker Books, 1995).  The target audience for both books was Christian, but most Christians seem to prefer the more popular and less-specialized treatments on the subject.  For those Christians, however, who want to exercise their minds with good, critical analysis of some of the principal intellectual influences on the NAM, then there is no better place to begin than with \\"Apologetics in the New Age,\\" provided that you can find a copy.<br /><br />After a general introduction to the topic and its importance, Part 1 expounds the thought of some of the primary historical roots (including those within the last century) that influenced the NAM.  The first three thinkers (Suzuki, Shankara, and Radhakrishnan) are Eastern whereas the last two (Plotinus and Spinoza) are Western.  Suzuki (1870 - 1966) is known for his key role in introducing Zen Buddhism to the West.  Shankara (c. 788 - c. 820) and Radhakrishnan (1888 - 1975), on the other hand, were Hindu thinkers.  Plotinus (A.D. 205 - 270) was a Greek philosopher whose influence was profound.  As our authors point out, Christian theology felt the effects of his work through Augustine and, by way of Proclus, through an unknown monk known as Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite.  Pseudo-Dionysius, because he was mistaken as the convert of Paul (Acts 17:34), has had a pervasive influence on medieval works of theology and devotion (mysticism).  For further exposition on the thought and influence of Plotinus and Pseudo-Dionysius, see Bernard McGinn's \\"The Foundations of Mysticism\\".  I must also add, since the authors don't, that Plotinus had a significant influence on Jewish Kabbalah (see Isaiah Tishby's The Wisdom of the Zohar, Volume 1, pg. 237).  Kabbalah is highly regarded by occultists (and the NAM in general).  Occult orders of the late 19th century such as The Theosophical Society and The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn utilized, with modification, its doctrines.  Spinoza (1634 - 1677), a philosopher of Jewish descent, is known for his pantheistic naturalism with its anti-supernatural bias.  The authors point out that Einstein said he believed in the God of Spinoza and both thinkers shared the belief that whatever happens in Nature happens by necessity.<br /><br />Part 2 (Evaluation of New Age Pantheism) opens with Chapter 6 which \\"summarizes pantheism's common threads\\" and \\"ties together similar themes in pantheism and shows how these ideas manifest themselves in the thought of typical New Age advocates\\" (pg. 13).  These themes are fleshed out and analyzed in Chapters 7 - 10.  I particularly liked the authors' seven \\"presumably exhaustive\\" logical alternatives regarding evil (pgs. 204 - 205).  Chapter 11 closes the book with a short review of the arguments and a positive (although too short) presentation of the strength of Christian theism.  This chapter points out that one does not have to denigrate rationality to cultivate a sense of divine mystery.  This is true, I might add, not only for pantheistic mystics but also theistic (and Christian) mystics.<br /><br />Another book I recommend reading and critically comparing with this one is \\"The Mystical Languages of Unsaying\\" by Michael Sells.  This book points out that apophasis (which literally means \\"speaking away\\") works as a mode of mystical discourse rather than as a negative theology.  He points out that the radical claims of apophatic writers, which have usually been written off as hyperbolic or condemned as pantheistic, are essential to understanding the mystical languages of unsaying.  Personally, I think that one of the keys to divine mystery is the doctrine of creation ex nihilo.The relationship between the Infinite and finite involves the paradox of nothingness which is essential to God's transcendence and immanence (not withstanding Moreland's analysis of \\"nothingness\\" as used by atheistic scientists to mean \\"zero energy,\\" see \\"Scaling the Secular City,\\" pgs. 38 - 41).  One of the names that the French mystic Marguerite Porete (burned as a heretic by the Inquisition) attributed to God was \\"FarNear\\" (see chapter 84 of her book \\"The Mirror of Simple Souls\\").  God is infinitely near and infinitely far away because of the nothingness that ontologically (and epistemologically via ignorance or \\"unknowing\\" - see \\"Mystical Theology\\" by Pseudo-Dionysius & \\"The Cloud of Unknowing\\" by an unknown English mystic) separates and unites us to God.  Because God created us out of nothing, there is \\"nothing\\" that separates us from God.  This \\"nothing\\" is not equivalent to space or mere emptiness (The Indian term for zero was sunya which meant empty or blank, but had no connotation of \\"void\\" or \\"nothing\\", see Dantzig's Number: The Language of Science).  My point is that one doesn't have to be a pantheist (all is God) to appreciate some of the profound mysteries that ground Christian theism and can, in a significant way, contribute to a Biblical Christian Mysticism.  As a closing note, I recommend replacing, in the Suggested Reading section, Arthur Johnson's \\"Faith Misguided: Exposing the Dangers of Mysticism\\" with Winfried Corduan's \\"Mysticism: An Evangelical Option?\\"  The latter, although at times too critical or shallow in understanding, is at least more sympathetic than Johnson when it comes to acknowledging a mystical element in Biblical Christianity.The relationship between the Infinite and finite involves the paradox of nothingness which is essential to God's transcendence and immanence (not withstanding Moreland's analysis of \\"nothingness\\" as used by atheistic scientists to mean \\"zero energy,\\" see \\"Scaling the Secular City,\\" pgs. 38 - 41).

The first two advocate a type of specific sovereignty whereas the latter two advocate a type of general sovereignty.  Therefore, Feinberg and Geisler have more in common with each other than the other two who also have more in common among themselves.  The differences between Feinberg and Geisler center around defining the nature of God's &quot;determining&quot; the future.  Feinberg holds to a type of causal determinism whereas Geisler holds to a type of epistemological determinism.  Because Geisler, like Reichenbach and Pinnock, holds to a contra-causal type of human freedom (actually, Geisler calls it &quot;self-determined&quot; or self-caused), he thinks that Feinberg's view of divine determinism makes God solely responsible for evil.  Feinberg, on the other hand, thinks that &quot;God cannot guarantee that something will assuredly occur if contra-causal freedom is correct.&quot;  He thinks that if God &quot;cannot guarantee it, then at best he thinks it will occur but does not know that it will&quot; (pg. 128).  For Feinberg, God foreknows because he foreordains and does not, as many Arminians say, foreordain because he foreknows.  He feels that Geisler doesn't make his position clear on this crucial issue and part of the reason is that he thinks Geisler confuses God's mental acts with his essence or attributes (e.g., omniscience).<br />Reichenbach and Pinnock (who consider themselves Arminians) seem to agree on everything except on what God can know.  Pinnock agrees in principle with Feinberg that if foreknowledge presupposes that all events are certain, then foreordination must render them certain.  However, he feels that since humans are free, God must not foreknow future free acts.  Why?  Because &quot;free actions are not entities which can be known ahead of time&quot; (pg. 157).  Reichenbach, on the other hand, agrees with Feinberg and Geisler that God does know future free acts, but differs with them in that he makes foreknowledge DEPEND upon the event and not vice versa.  He says, &quot;God will know the event if and only if the event occurs&quot; (pg. 110).  Geisler responds: &quot;But an independent Being who is the cause of everything which exists, or ever will exist, is not dependent on his creatures for anything.  They are dependent on him&quot; (pg. 133).  Reichenbach also differs from Feinberg and Geisler in limiting God's omnipotence.  Geisler critiques his view by saying that he gives God only the greatest ACTUAL power, but not the greatest POSSIBLE power (see pg. 132).<br />Although Feinberg and Geisler consider themselves &quot;moderate Calvinists,&quot; it seems clear that Feinberg has more in common with Reformed theology than Geisler.  For more on these issues, see Geisler's book &quot;Chosen but Free&quot; and James White's Reformed response to Geisler, &quot;The Potter's Freedom&quot;.  Regarding Pinnock and Reichenbach (and the editors, the Basingers), their departure from Classical Theism is addressed in Geisler's book &quot;Creating God in the Image of Man?&quot;  This book addresses Pinnock and other &quot;neotheists&quot; (as Geisler calls them).<br />I consider myself a &quot;moderate Arminian&quot; because I embrace Classical Theism and reject neotheism (what Geisler calls &quot;extreme Arminianism&quot;).  This book under review, among others, helped me refine my position.  Of all the positions in this book, I related more to Geisler (excluding his belief in &quot;once saved, always saved&quot;) .  Remember this: God created everything (except himself) OUT OF NOTHING and causally SUSTAINS it all in existence by his sovereign will.  This providential will does NOT contradict his prescriptive will which actively &quot;permits&quot; sin and evil.

Each author is allotted two pages and excerpts from their writings are presented along with a relevant picture or two.  The book covers 76 authors who are almost evenly divided into three general (and, in some cases, arbitrary) categories: spirituality, testimony, and philosophy.  Part I, Spirituality, begins with the biblical writer John and ends with Friedrich von Hugel.  In between are included such mystics as John Climacus, Johannes Tauler, John of the Cross, and Jean-Pierre de Caussade.  Part II, Testimony, begins with the biblical writer Luke and ends with Terese of Lisieux.  Other authors included are Augustine of Hippo, Francis of Assisi, Teresa of Avila, George Fox, and Jonathan Edwards.  Part III, Philosophy, begins with the apostle Paul and ends with Dietrich Bonhoeffer.  In between are such authors as Origen, Anselm, Thomas Aquinas, Eckhart, Martin Luther, John Calvin, Jacobus Arminius, Blaise Pascal, and Soren Kierkegaard.<br />This book would make a wonderful gift for a new Christian or someone who is unfamiliar with the classic authors of Christian literature, but keep in mind that only two one-sided pages are given to each author, so one can hardly get to know the authors introduced.  A useful, companion volume to this book (also general in nature) is Terry Glaspey's &quot;Great Books of the Christian Tradition&quot; which introduces one to many of the classic books of Christianity.  For nice summaries of the classics of Christian literature, I recommend books edited by Frank N. Magill and Ian P. McGreal such as &quot;Masterpieces of Christian Literature&quot; and &quot;Christian Spirituality&quot; or the one edited by Magill, &quot;Masterpieces of Catholic Literature&quot;.  Some of these latter books, unfortunately, are out of print but may be located in used book stores.  After one has been introduced to some of the classics, one should immediately begin reading them.  Many of the Christian classics of spirituality are included in the Paulist Press series called &quot;The Classics of Western Spirituality&quot;.

US	52496001	ROKY6IOLMC72Q	0140192794	804633399	A History of Magic (Arkana)	Books	5	10	11	N	N	A Condensed and Informative History of Occult Magic	The book is divided into four parts with corresponding subpart (chapters) as follows: Prologue: The Beginnings, Part 1 - Rome and the East {High Magic; Roman Religion and Magic; Healing, Dreams and Witchcraft; Astrology and Divination}, Part 2 - Christianity and the Middle Ages {The Magic of the Church; Runes and Druids; The Jewish Tradition; Alchemy, Astrology and Magic; Witchcraft and Sorcery}, Part 3 - The Renaissance and Witch Mania {From Ficino to Bruno; The Rosicrucians and the Burning Court; The Witch Mania}, Part 4 - The Modern Revival {The Eighteenth Century; The Rising Tide; Crowley and After}.<br />This text presents the main undercurrent of occult magic (or &quot;magick&quot; as distinct from stage magic or illusions) as it developed in Western Civilization up to the modern era.  Cavendish defines magic as &quot;an attempt to exert power through actions which are believed to have a direct and automatic influence on man, nature and the divine&quot;.  Its appeal is the promise of &quot;power and success unattainable by ordinary means.&quot;  He points out that &quot;it is impossible to isolate the history of magic completely from the history of religion or science.&quot;  Although each is distinct in theory (&quot;the religious impulse is to worship, the scientific to explain, the magical to dominate and command&quot;), in real life &quot;attitudes are not kept in separate compartments and the distinctions are frequently blurred&quot;.  One earlier, seminal work that seems to share this understanding is included in Cavendish's bibliography: the 8-vol. work entitled &quot;A History of Magic and Experimental Science&quot; (1923 - 58) by Lynn Thorndike.  The complete title of this work is &quot;A History of Magic and Experimental Science and their Relation to Christian Thought During the First Thirteen Centuries of Our Era.&quot;  Christianity is the background religion that Thorndike relates to magic and science.  This set is ..... and lengthy, but valuable.  Cavendish's &quot;A History of Magic&quot; is also valuable, especially since it condenses a lot of information into less than 200 pages and provides information on the major influences of modern magic.  For what it's worth, it was used by illusionist and critic of the paranormal James Randi in preparing his  &quot;An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural&quot; (See the semi-short bibliography at the back of Randi's book.).  If you can find a copy of &quot;A History of Magic&quot;, it makes an excellent companion to Cavendish's other book &quot;The Black Arts&quot; which has become a classic introduction to occultism and magick.  It is recommended for it's comprehensive and accurate presentation by a wide variety of sources (Christian, Occultist, and Skeptic).<br />Other books edited by Cavendish that are worth checking out include the multi-volume reference work &quot;Man, Myth and Magic&quot; and the one volume &quot;Encyclopedia of the Unexplained&quot;.  Cavendish is not a practitioner of the occult but an historian who seems to take an agnostic stance regarding his subject matter.e.

The Structure and Practices of Witchcraft}, PART II: The Biblical View of Contemporary Witchcraft {5 - The Word of God: What the Bible Says about Witchcraft, 6 - True Teachings? A Biblical Critique of Witches' Views}, and PART III: Philosophical Critiques of Witchcraft {7 - The Question of Truth: An Epistemological Critique of Witchcraft, 8 - The Problem of Evil: An Ethical Evaluation of Witchcraft, 9 - Conclusion}.<br />Part I is broad in nature and attempts to define witchcraft within the neo-pagan context by reference to many non-Christian authors of neo-pagan and witchcraft books.  Apart from input from the neo-pagan community and extensive personal reading of their books, it is difficult to ascertain whether Hawkins has accurately represented them in general, so I appreciated the earlier reviews by neo-pagans.  Although I am far from well-read on the subject, what I have read seems accurately reflected in Part I (e.g., Bonewits' Real Magic, Weinstein's Positive Magic, Curott's Book of Shadows, Amber K's True Magick, Starhawk's Spiral Dance, Adler's Drawing Down the Moon - These are just some of the books I own.  One video I own is &quot;The Occult Experience&quot;).  One minor problem I noticed is Hawkins' use of the term &quot;occult&quot;.  He defines it broadly on page 55 to include not only the secret, hidden, nonnormal and forbidden but also, connotatively, (among the noninitiated and nonwitches) the mysterious and supernatural (key components to Christianity).  He then quotes Isaac Bonewits and Raymond Buckland to show that many occultists see magic and the occult as involving natural, not supernatural, powers of the mind.  Although this is all true, Hawkins then uses the term &quot;occult&quot; throughout the book as synonymous with the forbidden which promotes confusion since there are mysterious and supernatural aspects to Biblical Christianity that are obviously not forbidden but included in his broad definition of &quot;the occult&quot;.<br />The reason for Part II is to show what the Bible says about witchcraft in particular and forbidden practices of the &quot;the occult&quot; in general.  Although Hawkins admits that neo-pagans don't accept the authority of the Bible (or the Christian God), he wants to refute those who try to justify their practices by appeals to the Bible.  After arguing for the historical reliability of the Bible based on historical evidence to show that the early church did not tamper with the Bible to exclude certain teachings as some occultists claim, he looks at certain passages of scripture within context and references the original biblical languages to show that certain occult practices are forbidden and that neo-pagan references to biblical passages to justify certain practices are unfounded.  The intent of Part II is not to prove the existence of the Christian's God or the truth of everything taught in the Bible.  These are assumed by Hawkins in this book.  For those who are interested in such proofs, one should refer to some of the books in Hawkins' Bibliography under Relevant Christian Works.  See, for example, the works of Norman Geisler , esp. &quot;Christian Apologetics&quot;.<br />Part III is philosophical in nature and, in my opinion, incomplete.  Although he strongly points out contradictions by proponents of witchcraft by using the law of non-contradiction, he fails to expound on the deeper, mystical and miraculous elements of true, biblical Christianity that would make it a positive, desirable alternative to witchcraft and magick.  Also, how does Christianity deal with the problem of evil?  Hawkins criticizes witches with committing the &quot;naturalistic fallacy&quot; but he fails to show how evil fits into a world supposedly created by a good God who sustains it all, including evil, in existence by an act of will.  Although neo-pagans and witches can certainly learn from this book as the other non-Christian reviewers have pointed out, this book is incomplete in its approach.  (Hawkins may point out that the book assumed a Christian audience, but this doesn't reduce the need to show the deeper side of Christianity to self-professing Christians who need to be well-grounded.  Also, non-Christians are obviously reading this book.)  Also, some Christian readers may be left with wondering whether magick really works although Hawkins' point is that regardless of whether it works, the Bible forbids the practice.  Some Christian authors  - such as professional illusionist Andre Kole (the Christian counterpart to the secular humanist and magician James Randi) - argue that there is more fraud than psychic powers in much that goes on in occult circles.  But Kole goes so far as to deny the existence of any psychic powers and denies that Satan and demons can give such powers or perform miracles.  He also criticizes other Christians who believe in psychic powers or the possibility of Satanic miracles.  His point, however, is worth considering: If Satan, demons, and occultists can perform &quot;miracles&quot;, then the argument of miracles as an apologetic for the deity of Christ must be considered worthless.  Personally, I'm still studying the whole issue, including the nature of so-called &quot;magick&quot; as it relates to supposedly natural (and God-given) powers of the human mind (as occultists affirm), but coming from a Pentecostal and Charismatic background, I do believe in divine miracles and that they can be manifested through faithful Christians who are being led by the Holy Spirit as revealed in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 in the New Testament of the Bible.  This chapter was referenced in a quote by Gavin and Yvonne Frost from their book &quot;The Magic Power of Witchcraft&quot; on pages 89 - 90 of Hawkins' book, but he failed to give the Christian perspective on these spiritual phenomena.  Many Christians believe such phenomena went out with the apostles and are not for today - Hawkins (and Andre Kole) may be one of them (Norman Geisler is definitely one of them).  I, however, am NOT one of them and sincerely believe that there is a deeply spiritual and miraculous side to Christianity that some Christians, real or just professing, are missing out on.izes witches with committing the &quot;naturalistic fallacy&quot; but he fails to show how evil fits into a world supposedly created by a good God who sustains it all, including evil, in existence by an act of will.

US	52496001	RCOQVK3VRDCZ6	0941478297	137503942	The Practice of the Presence of God (Christian Classic)	Books	5	331	342	N	N	A Seminal and Very Influential Classic of Spirituality	I first learned about this wonderful little book through another very useful book entitled &quot;Great Books of the Christian Tradition&quot; by Terry Glaspey.  Glaspey is a Christian booklover who's well read in Christian literature and considers this book one of the top ten that every Christian ought to read.  The value of Brother Lawrence's book is seen in the fact that it is one of the favorites of some of the other authors on Glaspey's top ten list: A.W. Tozer (author of &quot;The Pursuit of God&quot;) and Richard Foster (author of &quot;A Celebration of Discipline&quot;).  Another popular Christian author (who is a Quaker like Foster) that was influenced by Brother Lawrence is mentioned in the introduction by Hal Helms in Paraclete Press's edition of &quot;The Practice of the Presence of God&quot;: Hannah Whitall Smith (author of &quot;The Christian's Secret to a Happy Life&quot;).  Mrs. Smith called Lawrence's book &quot;one of the most helpful books I know.&quot;  And still another Quaker, Thomas Kelly (author of the classic, &quot;A Testament of Devotion&quot;), treasured Brother Lawrence's book as well.  This is just a small handful of major authors influenced by this classic that testifies to its enduring value in the broader Christian community.  I've read all of the above classics and therefore can personally testify that Brother Lawrence's principles are reflected in all of them!<br />Brother Lawrence of the Resurrection (a.k.a. Nicholas Herman) lived in the 17th century and was a monk within the Carmelite Order of the Roman Catholic Church.  This was the Order of such notable Christian mystics as St. Teresa of Avila and St. John of the Cross who authored other seminal mystical texts.  &quot;The Practice of the Presence of God&quot; is a small book of compiled documents of various literary genres.  The one who compiled them was the Abbe of Beaufort who is the author of the &quot;Eulogy&quot; portion of the book.  He was a close friend to Brother Lawrence and, at the request of others, published his eulogy along with four conversations he had with Brother Lawrence and sixteen letters from Brother Lawrence to various individuals (Reverend Mother N {for &quot;name&quot;}, Reverend Father N, and Madame N).  Also included in the compilation are Spiritual Maxims that condense his fundamental spiritual principles and teachings.  Included in The Paraclete Press's edition of this classic is a memoir from the Abbe de Beaufort entitled &quot;Brother Lawrence's Way of Life&quot;, published around two years after his Eulogy and recorded conversations.  Overall, The Paraclete Press's edition is a good compilation and translation (by Robert Edmonson) of this classic work.<br />The title of the book speaks volumes as to what the book is about.  Brother Lawrence was a very practical man whose struggles were common ones that we can all relate to.  His sincere honesty (and that of the Abbe) is apparent throughout and his spirituality is simple to understand.  Application, however, may not be so simple at first, but with disciplined PRACTICE one can turn one's life into a perpetual prayer to God.  Remember, prayer is more than just words on the lips (although that is important too!); it is a humble attitude of a heart that has abandoned itself to the God of grace!  Whatever the task is at hand (including such a mundane task as washing dishes like Brother Lawrence), one can offer it up to God in an act of love and worship.  Everything one does becomes sanctified as one lives unto God and follows the Holy Spirit's leading.  Two wonderful companion volumes to this book are &quot;Abandonment to Divine Providence&quot; by Jean-Pierre de Caussade (one of my favorites!) and the Eastern Orthodox classic &quot;The Way of a Pilgrim&quot; by an anonymous Russian pilgrim.  The former beautifully expounds on the same principles of Brother Lawrence's book and the latter reflects that same concern to &quot;pray without ceasing&quot; which is whatpracticing the presence of God is all about.hat practicing the presence of God is all about.	2000-12-01

It also gave some exposition of certain scriptural passages that may be old news for educated Calvinists, but was new to me and left me wondering how to respond with a viable Arminian interpretation.  I've read Geisler's book and do NOT consider him an Arminian, moderate or otherwise, primarily because of his stance on eternal security (once saved, always saved).  Although White is repulsed by Geisler calling himself a &quot;moderate Calvinist&quot; because Geisler rejects key elements of Reformed (Calvinistic) theology, I think the term is appropriate if for no other reason than that Geisler believes in eternal security which, to me, is a non-Arminian position.  For some Arminians, such as Dan Corner (author of The Believer's Conditional Security), this is the crucial practical issue which separates Arminians and Calvinists.  With this aside, I felt that many of White's criticisms of Geisler were valid but others misplaced.  I also feel that both authors make general assumptions that Neal Punt has exposed as weaknesses in his twin books &quot;Unconditional Good News&quot; and &quot;What's Good About the Good News?&quot;  Punt is a Reformed author who has provided  valuable insights often overlooked by both Calvinists and Arminians of all varieties.  Because I'm a moderate Arminian, however, I think that some of Punt's views (such as the idea that infants deserve hell because of original sin {I disagree} but go to heaven if they die because they haven't committed personal sin {I agree}) need tailoring.<br />The title and thrust of White's book is to emphasize God's freedom.  He accuses Geisler of giving to the creatures (pots) what is denied to the Creator (the Potter): freedom of choice (see page 305).  But he seems to forget that man does have an ability that God doesn't have: the ability (not inevitability!) TO WILLFULLY SIN.  Arminians and moderate Calvinists reject Reformed theology precisely because it seems to attribute to God the freedom to violate fundamental moral principles which Arminians and moderate Calvinists think that God is NOT free to violate because it would make God out to be evil.  The disagreements are principally moral in nature and center around sin and the basis for God sending anybody to hell.  The problem is more fundamental than the Christian fact that God isn't obligated to be merciful to sinners although He is freely merciful to some.  The fundamental moral question is this: Does God have the freedom to unconditionally and monergistically damn some to hell via Adam just as He supposedly unconditionally and monergistically elects others to heaven via Christ?  Reformed theology in general seems to emphatically answer &quot;Yes!&quot;.  This position makes God out to be an evil, sadistic tyrant in the eyes of moderate Calvinists and Arminians.  It also leads to theological problems and misunderstandings as shown in several places in White's book.  Here's two:  1)  White approvingly quotes Boettner on page 128 regarding the Reformed Faith's position on &quot;the eternal, divine decree which antecedently to any difference or desert in men themselves separates the human race into two portions and ordains one to everlasting life and the other to everlasting death.&quot;  Boettner continues: &quot;So far as this decree relates to men it designates the counsel of God concerning those who had a supremely favorable chance in Adam to earn salvation, but who lost that chance.&quot;  HUH?  Adam was in a primal state of grace (NOT mercy!) before his first sin.  It wasn't his job to &quot;earn salvation&quot;, and it certainly wasn't his progeny's job either!  Adam is an anomaly to Reformed theology because there was no original sin that &quot;caused&quot; Adam to willfully sin, but if reprobation is just as unconditional as election as at least some Reformed theologians teach, then sin Adam must... and by divine decree (not original sin)!<br />2)  The second problem/misunderstanding is seen on pages 226 - 227 where White quotes Geisler and then misinterprets him.  Geisler (correctly!) states: &quot;There is absolutely no reason to believe... that God predestines certain persons to eternal hell apart from their own free choice.&quot;  White responds: &quot;We know by this point what underlies this assertion: it is the belief that man's free choice is the ultimate factor in the work of salvation.&quot;  HUH?  Within context, Geisler's point was just the opposite!  Replace &quot;salvation&quot; with &quot;damnation&quot; in White's response and you'll have Geisler's true meaning and the key fundamental protest against Reformed theology that White insufficiently addresses in his book: damnation is synergistic and conditional, not monergistic and unconditional as Reformed theology apparently teaches.<br />I accept the biblical doctrine of original sin which teaches that all are sinners and temporarily die because of Adam as our representative, but I protest the Calvinistic idea that we are all - including infants - worthy of everlasting death in hell because of Adam's representation and original sin apart from our own free, unnecessary, and divinely prohibited choice to personally sin.  Adam was free not to willfully sin and so are we.  Original sin which causes unconscious sin and internal desires/temptations (lusts of the flesh) is distinct from personal, willful sin which freely and culpably fulfills those desires that the apostle Paul tells us not to fulfill.  Only personal sin warrants everlasting death, not original sin which warrants only temporal death.  That is why all who die in infancy who haven't committed personal sin go to heaven solely by God's grace!  Here's a thought for Calvinists to ponder: If everybody unconditionally warrants hell because of original sin, then why wasn't (and isn't) Christ's atonement (eternally) in hell instead of on a physical cross upon which was spilt his physical blood?  People go to hell synergistically (because of unrepentant, willful sin that God permits), not monergistically (because of unconditional divine reprobation)!some Reformed theologians teach, then sin Adam must... and by divine decree (not original sin)!<br />2)  The second problem/misunderstanding is seen on pages 226 - 227 where White quotes Geisler and then misinterprets him.

Stanley Horton, Th.D., is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Bible and Theology at Assemblies of God Theological Seminary in Springfield, Mo.  He is a third generation Pentecostal who profoundly influenced the course of Assemblies of God theology.  His academic expertise (including a mastery of the biblical languages) set a high standard for Pentecostals.  He has authored many books and is the editor of Logion Press' Systematic Theology (Rev. Ed.) text, a scholarly composition by A/G ministers on important Bible doctrines.  For those who want to know more about Mr. Horton, see the article on him in the Dictionary of Pentecostal and Charismatic Movements, edited by Burgess and McGee.<br /><br />In this book, the author topically analyzes the Bible book by book, applying sound hermeneutical principles to reveal what scripture says about the Holy Spirit.  The author deals with the Holy Spirit in (by chapter title)... 1) The World Today, 2) The Pentateuch, 3) The History of Israel, 4) The Writing Prophets, 5) The Life and Ministry of Jesus, 6) The Teaching of Jesus, 7) The Book of Acts, 8) Everyday Living, 9) The Ministry of Believers, 10) The Ministry of the Church, and 11) Supernatural Demonstrations.  One will learn about the titles and symbols of the Holy Spirit along with His personality and deity and His gifts and fruit.  The Pentecostal distinctive of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit with the initial, physical evidence of speaking in other tongues is also discussed.  Another excellent companion volume to this classic is \\"The Holy Spirit: A Pentecostal Perspective\\" by Thomas Holdcroft.  Both of these books were used as texts for my Bible College class on pneumatology.  Thanks Opal Reddin for introducing them to me and for your anointed teaching ministry!	2000-11-15

The prayer reinforces one's absolute dependence on God's grace and sensitizes one's soul to the Holy Spirit's leadings.  One is reminded of that other classic of the spiritual life by Brother Lawrence, The Practice of the Presence of God.  To pray without ceasing is possible, but one must internalize prayer to make it an automatic, perpetual attitude of submission, not just a few words on the lips.  The anonymous pilgrim was successful because of his faith-filled determination to locate the scriptural key to unceasing prayer and open the spiritual lock through practice.  He seeks until he finds, and what he finds is a treasure of joy unspeakable and full of glory and a peace which passes all understanding.  My heart was with the pilgrim throughout his wanderings because his concern was mine and, if it's your concern as well, you too will find that treasure.	2000-11-14

Books	5	28	30	N	N	A Careful & Balanced Analysis of Mysticism	Unlike Arthur Johnson's lopsided approach in \\"Faith Misguided: Exposing the Dangers of Mysticism\\" (Moody Press, 1988), Corduan offers  a balanced, modest approach to the topic.  He is aware of the complex,  multi-dimensional nature of the subject and carefully looks at the various  positions within the literary field.  In his personal introduction (Chapter  One), he states his theological and methodological presuppositions which  include his commitment to Evangelical Christianity and biblical inerrancy.  He states: \\"Ultimately, a mystical experience may not be the standard  for evaluating truth in the Bible, but the Bible must remain the standard  by which personal realities and experiences are tested\\" (pg. 17).  Corduan also wisely points out the need to presuppose that the best  authority on the phenomena of mysticism are mystics themselves and any  critical analysis of mystical experience has to be based on interpretations  because \\"the pure phenomenality of the experienced has to go  unassailed\\" (pg. 19).  Chapter Two addresses the question \\"What  is Mysticism?\\"  He acknowledges that this is no easy task because  \\"many definitions will tend to be so specific as to say too much or so  general as to say too little\\" (pg. 22).  After critiquing various  definitions, he settles for an understanding of mysticism as \\"an  unmediated link to an absolute.\\"  Chapter Three answers the question of  \\"Does Mysticism Have a Common Core?\\" by siding with neither the  advocates of unanimity (The Perennial Philosophy) nor the advocates of an  extreme pluralism.  Instead, he takes a Thomistic approach which holds that  some mystical experiences across various religious and philosophical  backgrounds can be similar. (One is reminded of Aquinas' distinction  between univocal, equivocal, and analogical language.)<br /><br />Chapter Four asks,  \\"Does Mysticism Have an Objective Referent?\\". Within this  chapter, Corduan basically explores the subjective and objective aspects of  mysticism and points out that the question of truth can't be settled within  a given experience without looking at the whole frame of reference (the  world view).  Because Corduan is a committed Christian, he admits, for  example, that his rejection of Hinduism as a religion leads him to reject  the experience contained therein (pg. 75).  This, again, takes us back to  the distinction between an experience and its interpretation.  Because one  can experience deception, tests for truth are important and contradictory  world views cannot all be true.  Having made this point, Corduan adds his  theory of a natural mystical faculty within humans that can be activated  either purely subjectively or by objective causes.<br /><br />Chapter Five asks,  \\"Can Language Describe Mystical Experience?\\" Because William James  and others posit ineffability as a key characteristic of mystical  experience, Corduan looks at this factor in relation to apophatic language.  He analyzes the reasons (theories) given by advocates of ineffability such  as  the Insider Theory (the nonmystic can't understand what the mystic is  saying), the Limits-of-Language Theory, the Lack-of-Concept Theory, and the  Limits-of-Logic Theory.  Each is shown as coming up short.  Again, insights  from Thomas Aquinas are utilized and the solution of analogical language is  posited.  \\"Analogy always implies a similarity and a difference, and  this is also true of language about finite things compared to language  about God.\\"  For those who want further analysis of apophatic and  cataphatic language, see Corduan's and Geisler's \\"Philosophy of  Religion\\".  Another important contemporary book that looks at the  nature of apophatic language as used by the mystics is \\"Mystical  Languages of Unsaying\\" by Michael Sells (April 1994).<br /><br />Chapter Six,  Mysticism in Christendom, looks at Eastern Orthodoxy as defended by Lossky  (The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church).  Corduan carefully points  out positive and negative aspects.  One positive aspect is the emphasis on  God's grace; one negative aspect is that it seems to minimize sin and  reconciliation.  But Corduan quickly admits that as a Westerner, he may not  be able to see all of the ramifications of \\"theosis\\" (the  \\"deification\\" of the human being).  Theosis is not to be confused  with pantheism.  The trinitarian personal God who is both transcendent and  immanent is foundational to Eastern Orthodoxy.  Within Western Mysticism,  Corduan looks at Augustine,  Meister Eckhart, Teresa of Avila and John of  the Cross and, again, looks at pros and cons.  Regarding Eckhart, there is  conflict of interpretation which can put Eckhart within or outside of  Orthodoxy.  Corduan looks at both.  Regarding Teresa and John, he points  out that both do not equate the mystical experience of union with salvation  and that some protestants may think that both mystics have usurped God's  grace by a notion of reward.  Finally, a summary is provided that separates  certain ideas within mysticism in general from biblical  Christianity.<br /><br />Chapter Seven is entitled \\"New Testament-Based  Mysticism\\".  It concludes that there is a mystical reality in the  believer's relationship to the triune God through adoption as God's child,  a position \\"in Christ,\\" and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit,  but the chapter ends with a paradox that I'll leave for future readers to  discover.  Overall, I enjoyed Corduan's analysis which gave me some food  for thought.  I also appreciate his sympathetic, although cautious,  approach to the topic.  Too bad this book is, as of this review, out of  print.  For those who want another critical evangelical analysis of  mysticism of a pantheistic variety, I recommend David Clark's and Norman  Geisler's \\"Apologetics in the New Age\\".itive aspect is the emphasis on  God's grace; one negative aspect is that it seems to minimize sin and  reconciliation.

What makes this particular book interesting is that it shows  you, through many examples, how logic can be used in defending the  Christian faith although such a defense is not the primary purpose of this  book.<br />During my in-depth study of this book (and study - not casual  reading - is what it'll take to master these principles of logic), I've  noted a few minor errors.  For example, on page 46, the allocated figures  for some moods are either incomplete or erroneous.  Compare this list with  the chart on page 45 and you'll see what I mean.  For example, mood (AEO)  should read 2,4 and not 3,4 and mood EAE should read 1,2 and not 1,2,4.  On  the same page (46), the authors state: &quot;Mood and figure are governed  by rules 4 through 7 of the syllogism.&quot;  Technically, figure is  determined primarily by rules 1 - 3 (governing TERMS) whereas mood is  determined primarily by rules 4 - 7 (governing PREMISES).  Aside from these  minor technicalities, this book is invaluable to Christians and apologists  - and anyone else for that matter - who want to sharpen their thinking  skills.  Highly Recommended!	2000-06-19

It is also a contemporary classic in the genre (eschatology).  The book is divided into  two parts, each with 5 chapters.  Part I, Exposition, concentrates on the  explanation and application of key principles of biblical interpretation as  they relate to the subjects of death and the afterlife.  The five chapter  titles of Part I are: 1) The Hermeneutics of Death, 2) Body, Soul and  Spirit, 3) Sheol, Hades and Gehenna, 4) Immortality, Resurrection, and  Everlasting Life, and 5) Punishment: Conscious and Eternal.  Chapters 1 - 3  discuss 6 key interpretive principles, the nature of humankind, and the  Hebrew &amp; Greek words used in the Bible to refer to human nature and  certain places in the afterlife.  Chapter 4 is short and acts as a sort of  preface to the much longer Chapter 5 which, as the chapter title suggests,  argues that hell is conscious and unending punishment for sin.  Biblical  terminology is analyzed along with the usage of terms in Rabbinic  literature, the New Testament Apocrypha, and Patristic writings.<br />Part II,  Defense, takes the conclusions of Part I and strengthens them with an  apologetic approach that addresses anti-biblical contemporary belief  systems regarding death and the afterlife.  The 5 chapter titles of Part II  are: 6) The Present Situation, 7) Materialism, 8) Annihilationism, 9)  Universalism, and 10) Occultism.  According to Dr. Morey, materialism is  the reduction of everything to matter.  Annihilationism is the theory that  the wicked pass into non-existence either at death or at the resurrection.  Universalism is the idea that all men will find themselves ultimately in an  eternal state of bliss, and Occultism involves communication with the  spirits of the dead.<br />There are two appendices.  The first was written by  Dr. Alfred Edersheim and is entitled &quot;On Eternal Punishment, According  to the Rabbis and the New Testament.&quot;  The second appendix is a  compilation of additional readings from Justin Martyr and Irenaeus (two  early Church fathers).  Overall, this book is an essential reference work  in the study of anthropology and eschatology.  It was one of the works that  contributed to my personal belief that God alone is &quot;eternal&quot;  (without beginning or end) and everything else is either temporal or  &quot;everlasting&quot; as He wills.

Hodge stated in his Systematic  Theology: &quot;All the descendants of Adam, except Christ, are under  condemnation; all the descendants of Adam, except those of whom it is  expressly revealed that they cannot inherit the kingdom of God, are  saved.&quot;  According to Punt, &quot;For those who are finally lost the  Bible reveals no other cause than their own willful, persistent, unbelief  and sin.  For those who are saved, it is God alone who graciously,  sovereignly, elects and saves them&quot; (pg. 44).  Punt believes that  salvation is unconditional (by grace), but condemnation is conditional (by  works).  He rejects the idea as unbiblical that someone is damned solely on  the basis of Adamic solidarity and original sin apart from personal sin.  Since those who die in infancy haven't committed any personal sin (although  they inherit original sin), they are saved.  Original sin that deserves  hell is distinguished from personal (willful and persistent) sin that  guarantees hell.  According to Punt, everybody (including infants) deserves  hell (an offensive idea to many, including myself - infants deserve hell?),  but only those who personally persist in disobeying God's revealed will in  either general or special revelation will actually go to hell.  Because  Punt believes that everybody is elect in Christ except those who persist in  willful sin, he also believes it is possible that some are saved without  ever hearing the proclamation of the gospel, provided that they do not  persistently resist God's will as revealed to them apart from  scripture.<br />As the reviewer from Arizona has stated, there is ambiguity  about Punt's view of human freedom as it relates to divine sovereignty.  Logically, it seems that Biblical Universalism (BU) must EITHER hold to  unconditional election of everybody in Christ, without exception, and then  posit that some conditionally fall from that election by willful and  persistent sin (just as Adam fell from primal grace when he was free not  to), OR hold to unconditional PARTICULAR election in Christ of some and  unconditional particular reprobation in Adam of others.  Punt rejects both  sides to this either/or and argues that BU is &quot;beyond logic&quot; and  &quot;splendidly illogical&quot; (see Chapter Seven).  To me, this is an  evasion.  Although Punt makes a distinction between original sin and  personal sin, he clearly holds a Calvinistic notion of freedom which  rejects the power of contrary choice (pg. 95).  So, logically, it appears  that God ensures the damnation of some of the human race by not giving them  the ability to avoid the sin (original and/or willful sin) that inevitably  leads to hell.  Punt doesn't want to admit this but prefers to speak about  &quot;the mystery of lawlessness&quot; or a &quot;no man's land&quot; that  surrounds the camp of those eternally elected.  As a moderate Arminian, I'm  not convinced that Punt's BU doesn't mean an unconditional bad news for  some sinners who weren't given the divine gift of being able to avoid hell.of everybody in Christ, without exception, and then  posit that some conditionally fall from that election by willful and  persistent sin (just as Adam fell from primal grace when he was free not  to), OR hold to unconditional PARTICULAR election in Christ of some and  unconditional particular reprobation in Adam of others.

The book is divided into two parts.  The first, entitled  \\"The Historical Roots of Western Mysticism,\\" looks at the primary  sources of mysticism in the Jewish, Greek, and Christian traditions.  Sacred apocalyptic and ascensional texts, including the chariot vision of  Ezekiel (the basis of Merkavah mysticism) are discussed.  The significance  of the Song of Songs is emphasized.  Works from Plato, Philo, Plotinus (his  Enneads are a masterpiece of mystical literature), and Proclus are seen as  providing significant contributions along with Gnostic and Hermetic  sources.  When handling the New Testament writings, McGinn is sensitive to  his conservative readers and points out that although the apostles Paul and  John weren't mystics in the sense that we may speak of Origen and Augustine  as mystics, there is certainly a mystical element within Christianity from  its beginnings, and Christian scriptures are \\"certainly susceptible to  mystical readings\\" as he shows.  Although early spokesmen for  orthodoxy such as Justin, Irenaeus and Clement were all anti-Gnostic, each  is seen as contributing to the mystical theology of Church tradition.  Origen, called \\"The Master of Early Christian Thought,\\" is given  extended treatment before delving into monastic origins that begin with the  father of monks, St. Antony.  McGinn explores the thought of Gregory of  Nyssa, Macarius the Great, Evagrius Ponticus, and the seminal but  controversial Pseudo-Dionysius, whose influence (and apophatic method) has  been \\"more powerful than any other Eastern mystic.\\"<br /><br />Part II,  \\"The Beginnings of Western Mysticism,\\" concentrates primarily on  Augustine although the Early Latin Fathers Ambrose of Milan, Jerome, and  John Cassian are discussed.  If all this wasn't enough, we are graced with  a very valuable appendix that discusses all the major modern contributors  to the study of mysticism.  The appendix is divided into three sections  according to approach: Theological, Philosophical, and Comparativist &  Psychological.  Names referenced include Schweitzer, Inge, Underhill, Kirk,  Butler, Poulain, Merton, James, Von Hugel, Marechal, Maritain, Stace, Otto,  Zaehner, Leuba, Jung, Scholem, and Huxley.

According  to Ms. Underhill, &quot;mysticism is the art of union with Reality&quot;  and &quot;a mystic is a person who has attained that union in a greater or  less degree; or who aims at and believes in such attainment.&quot;  With  this definition, she leads the &quot;normal person&quot; of common  consciousness on to understanding the uncommon path of the mystic whose  consciousness is more intense, more extended and, therefore, more open to  the REAL since it embraces life AS IT IS in a sacred and liberated way.  But such apprehension must come only through self-simplification, a  purification of both the senses and the will.  What begins in  &quot;active&quot; self-discipline through the first and second stages of  contemplation continues with the third stage of effortless  &quot;infusion&quot; and passive suffering, called by St. John of the Cross  &quot;the dark night of the soul&quot;.  This last stage is necessary to  &quot;complete the decentralization of one's character, test the purity of  one's love, and perfect one's education in humility.&quot;  The last  fragments of narrow-minded selfhood are destroyed and the perfect peace of  absolute surrender to Divine Reality, enveloped in a union of love, is  manifest.  &quot;God's action takes the place of man's activity.&quot;<br />Ms. Underhill's book is saturated with an experiential understanding of  the great mystics which are referenced and quoted throughout.  Names such  as Plotinus, St. Teresa, St. John of the Cross, Kabir, Bonaventura,  Ruysbroeck (her favorite mystic), Richard of St. Victor, Julian of Norwich,  (Pseudo-)Dionysius, Thomas a Kempis, and anonymous works such as The Cloud  of Unknowing and The Theologia Germanica all find their place alongside  poets such as Keats, Whitman, and Blake.

This is one of a few books I've read that, upon reading it, actually manifested God's presence.  In line with the teaching of the book, God impressed upon me his love and his desire for a more intimate relationship.  I broke into tears.  Few books have had that impact.  The chapter entitled  &quot;The Blessedness of Possessing Nothing&quot; is a profound call to  absolute simplicity and abandonment to God who owns everything you may  think you &quot;possess&quot;, including yourself!

Although most of the over 530 reviews before mine  were written by young adults or children, several were also written by  adults (including teachers).  I find it strange that nobody mentioned the  Jungian connection until now.  Carl Jung's concepts of synchronicity, the  collective unconscious (\\"Elsewhere\\" and \\"Memories of the  Whole World\\"), Archtypes of the Unconscious, our \\"twin\\"  shadow figures (see Lily's ramblings on pg. 137) which teach us through our  dreams, the Self (\\"this IS my life... the memories\\" pg. 103)...  it's all there hidden in the text.  The term \\"Elsewhere\\" is  ambiguous and equivocal; it has different meanings.  Those who are  \\"released\\" (killed) or \\"lost\\" (natural death) go  \\"Elsewhere.\\"  But \\"Elsewhere\\" also implies somewhere  outside of the community where there are hills, snow, animals, and, it is  implied (although made improbable - e.g., airplanes), a civilization like  the readers of the book, but I don't believe Lowry intended that OUR  civilization co-exist on the same planet as Jonas's, and the Elsewhere that  he and Gabe found at the end of the novel was the \\"final  destination\\" that \\"held their future and their past\\" (pg.  179) as well as that of every person: DEATH, which, paradoxically, does not  necessarily mean non-existence but entrance into an afterlife.  But, given  Jung's (and Lowry's) philosophy, the afterlife or Elsewhere that Jonas and  Gabe experience is the Collective Unconscious or Memory of the entire human  race!  Remember, \\"memories are forever\\" (pg. 104) and we ARE our  memories (pgs. 103-104).  The end of the last chapter is vague precisely  because entrance into the Jungian Elsewhere via \\"received\\"  memories (of Christmas, the sled, etc.) and imagination (that \\"special  knowledge that was deep inside him,\\" pg. 179, before he died) is vague  as a philosophical idea.<br /><br />Aside from the Jungian philosophy, there are  obviously many great things about this book that make it a classic for both  young and old.

After reading &quot;A Pilgrim's Path&quot;, I'm more  sympathetic to Freemasonry, but the book raised some issues that I wish  Robinson could have addressed.  Maybe other Freemasons will.  One is the  question of evangelism or &quot;witnessing&quot; among Freemasons of  different religions.  Robinson stated that &quot;there's no witnessing or  arguing over religious beliefs in the lodge&quot; (pg 35), but does this  mean that Freemasons can't witness or rationally discuss religious beliefs  outside of lodge meetings?  If the answer is yes, then Freemasonry IS  anti-Christian on this point since Christianity is evangelistic.  If the  answer is no, then Freemasonry as an organization should point this out  because &quot;freedom of religion&quot; should include the freedom to  change one's religion or get others to change their religion (by reason,  not force).<br />Although Robinson states that &quot;there is no religious  dogma&quot; in Freemasonry (pg 35), the statement that &quot;every  Freemason asserts his belief in God, and in the immortality of the  soul&quot; (pg 146) IS a religious dogma that excludes atheism and the  secular belief that death is annihilation.  If Freemasonry is truly about  &quot;freedom of religion,&quot; a political dogma, then why exclude  atheists?  Can't atheists be just as giving and kind as Christians, Jews,  Muslims, Deists, polytheistic Mormons and pantheistic Hindus?  If so, then  WHY is Freemasonry necessary as an organization?  To provide an  &quot;opportunity to engage in the good works which are required from every  believer in every moral religion&quot;?  Then why exclude moral atheists as  members?<br />Robinson's defense (pg 77) of Freemasonry's use of  &quot;brother&quot; to address members should have taken a different  approach.  Surely Robinson wasn't ignorant of the fact that according to  Christianity, the term &quot;brother&quot; (or even &quot;sister&quot;) is  used RELIGIOUSLY to refer to those who share the same profession of faith  and is NOT used to refer to those who are not Christian and considered  &quot;unsaved.&quot;  He should have said that &quot;brother&quot; is used  by Freemasons in a fraternal, not religious, sense instead of implying that  &quot;all mankind&quot; are Christ's (spiritual?) brethren which implies  that Freemasonry IS religious and believes in universalism (the salvation  of everybody; the denial of hell).<br />Regarding Robinson's appraisal of  Albert Pike, I'm still leaning towards Robert Morey's negative appraisal of  him given in his book &quot;The Truth about Masons.&quot;  Unlike many  Christian books on Freemasonry, Morey believes the organization started out  as a Christian men's fraternity, but, due to men like Pike, ended up a  hodge-podge of Occultism and Hinduism.<br />Overall, this book was a good read  and I highly recommend Christians and the &quot;religious right&quot; to  read this book. - Brad Clarkuld have taken a different  approach.

The three main branches of Christianity are covered: Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Eastern Orthodox. Early mystical writers  such as Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Augustine open the book, and  modern day mystics such as Evelyn Underhill, Thomas Merton, and Pierre  Teilhard de Chardin close the book.  In between are such names as  Pseudo-Dionysius, St. Francis of Assisi, St. Teresa of Avila, St. John of  the Cross.  I was a little disappointed to see some of my favorite mystics  such as Jean Pierre de Caussade and Thomas Kelly given just a mention, but  at least they weren't forgotten.  Francois Fenelon, however, wasn't even  mentioned.  After one reads this book, I highly recommend the 5-volume  series by Bernard McGinn entitled &quot;The Presence of God,&quot;  currently in the making (3 vols complete to date).

Sproul rightly critiques Van Til's contradictions about whether non-Christians have \\"true\\" knowledge of God.  Sproul argues that they do in accordance with Romans Chapter One and shows that Van Til  inconsistently admits that they do also even though in other places he says  or implies that they don't.  One does not need to \\"presuppose\\"  God because, according to Romans One (and Sproul), all have at least some  knowledge of God through God's natural/general revelation.  This allows for  a common ground between Christians and non-Christians.  But Sproul, being a  Classical Apologist, still thinks that one must posit proofs for God's  existence even though everybody apparently already knows God exists.  This  is confusing.  Sproul, on pages 262 and 263, basically says that the  primary task of the apologist is to not let the non-Christians who argue  against the truth they already know \\"escape\\" by  \\"reminding\\" them of \\"arguments which they cannot deny.\\"  This, to me, is a ridiculous and weak justification for doing  Classical/Traditional apologetics.  If God's existence is taken for granted  in the Bible (including Romans 1), and nowhere proven because everybody  apparently already knows that God exists, then theistic apologetics  (distinct from Christian evidences) is a waste of time. (side note: I agree  with Mortimer J. Adler who said that \\"true knowledge\\" is  redundant and \\"false knowledge\\" is a contradiction in terms) -  Brad Clark	1999-03-11

I've come to appreciate the  paradox of &quot;nothing matters; everything matters.&quot;  As Kelly said,  God &quot;gives us the royal blindness of faith, and the seeing eye of the  sensitized soul, and the grace of unflinching obedience.  Then we see that  nothing matters, and that everything matters, and that this my task matters  for me and for my fellow men and for Eternity.  And if we be utterly humble  we may be given the strength to be obedient even unto death, yea the death  of the Cross.&quot;  My goal is to write a devotional, theological book to  compare to it.  I am not yet up to the task.  I have many notes from my  many readings, but first I must make God's presence and will the deepest  realities in my life as they obviously were in Kelly's.  I have the head  knowledge, but lack the deepest heart's passion and abandonment to divine  breathings that are required to pen a masterpiece. I've learned from Kelly  that it is more important that I live as God's masterpiece than pen one  myself.  As Kelly said, &quot;practice comes first in religion, not theory  or dogma.&quot;<br />One correction to my earlier review: Kelly discussed the  paradox of &quot;nothing matters; everything matters&quot; with a Hindu  monk, not a Buddhist one.<br />In closing, I'm somewhat surprised to find that  Kelly's book is not as popular as it deserves to be.  But, then again, I'm  not. - Brad Clark	1999-02-18
US	52496001	RTTLFL6SSLZYY	0451523881	569503661	The Brothers Karamazov (Signet classics)	Books	5	4	7	N	N	A Masterpiece of Philosophical Literary Fiction	As a Christian, I consider this book essential reading for all Christians.  Dostoevsky argues, sometimes covertly, for the essential tie between morality (conscience) and God.  The famous quote, &quot;If God does not  exist, everything is permitted,&quot; assumes that without an objective  moral God, everything is objectively amoral (even if subjective morals  exist).  To me, the novel shows how some (not necessarily all) professing  atheists try to philosophically justify their actions that would otherwise  be considered immoral.  The way they justify their immorality is to  subjectivize (relativize) all morality thereby making everything, including  murder, inherently amoral.  The problem with this approach is that the  protest against evil becomes subjective and objectively collapses.  Absolute good (God) defines absolute evil.  Without God, absolute evil  can't exist and Ivan's examples of human cruelty lose their force by  becoming objectively excusable types of behavior.  Dostoevsky also  brilliantly shows the bankruptcy of human courts of justice.  We the  readers know that Dmitri is innocent of the death of his father, but the  evidence makes him look guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt...  If there is  no just God and life after death (immortality), then we're stuck with human  injustice masquerading as justice and no hope of the wrongs in this life  being righted in the next.  Aside from these Christian topics, the  brilliance of Dostoevsky's work is that many atheists such as Camus,  Sartre, Nietzsche and Freud have found this work a masterpiece.  Dostoevsky  showed that saints can look like sinners and sinners can look like saints  and we are left wondering who is actually innocent or guilty of what.  Read  the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation.<br />After reading this novel, check  out Franz Kafka's &quot;The Trial.&quot;  Kafka was another great who  learned from Dostoevsky. - Brad Clark	1999-02-10

This book and &quot;Abandonment to Divine Providence&quot; by Jean-Pierre de Caussade are my favorite Christian devotional/mystical classics.  Kelly's book is  prose poetry that romances and broadens the spirit at the same time as it  educates the mind.  I used to compartmentalize spiritual things and  separate them from the &quot;non-spiritual&quot; mundane activities in  life.  This outlook is in error, according to Kelly.  ALL activities in  life become &quot;spiritual&quot; and significant as one lives within the  Divine Center, listening and following the Spirit's leadings.  Only within  this Center is there true peace in the midst of a world full of  &quot;inevitable suffering&quot; and people who do NOT live within the  Divine Center.<br />Although I love this book, the biographical section does  mention Kelly's interest in Eastern philosophies and his fascination with  A.N. Whitehead's teachings.  Whitehead promoted panentheism and not true  Christian theism.  Also, Kelly does occasionally seem to give credence in  his book to &quot;non-Christian&quot; forms of spirituality. In one place  he mentions a conversation he had with a Buddhist monk over the religious  paradox of &quot;everything matters; nothing matters&quot; which he tells  his reader to contemplate in religious experience.  Also, his reading of  devotional classics included &quot;The Prophet&quot; by Khalil Gibran, a  non-Christian book to say the least.  How much Eastern philosophies have  influenced Kelly, I cannot say, but I do say that there is much in Kelly's  book that has affected me both deeply and permanently; I highly recommend  this book. - Brad Clark	1998-11-27

This is especially true of The Trial.  But I would  add that The Trial takes us to the limits of MORAL thought.  When reading  The Trial, think about what disturbs you about the book and why.  What  values are highlighted negatively?  Because Kafka highlights certain values  that I hold dear by fictionally violating them, I am more convinced that  these values are absolute than before I read his works, especially The  Trial.  This is one of the most profound books, fiction or nonfiction, that  I have ever read.  Although some would argue that Kafka's works are  difficult to understand, I would say that one is better off FEELING one's  way through them.  Kafka's works are MYSTICAL!	1998-08-25
US	52496001	R2IFHLZR4FQKUI	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Great Book & Theme, But 21st Chapter Contradicts the Rest	This book has almost as many reader reviews as The Satanic Bible by Anton LaVey.  There is something about the Dark Side that attracts and tempts us with promises of escape (real or imaginary) from the boredom in everyday life.  Burgess, in his introduction to ACO, attributes this attraction to \\"Original Sin\\" and says he enjoyed ripping and raping by proxy through his protagonist, Alex.  But there was a moral point: \\"If one can only perform good or only perform evil, then he is a clockwork orange - meaning that he has the appearance of an organism lovely with colour and juice but is in fact only a clockwork toy to be wound up by God or the Devil or (since this is increasingly replacing both) the Almighty State.\\" He continues: \\"It is as inhuman to be totally good as it is to be totally evil.  The important thing is moral choice.  Evil has to exist along with good, in order that moral choice may operate.\\"<br /><br />From the 1st to the 20th chapter, one is (although vaguely) under the assumption that Alex is free to choose good or evil but gets more pleasure out of evil.  Alex says he does evil because he likes it just as some people do good because they like it. Alex assumes his own freedom and uses it (and Burgess through him) to mock those who think that evil is not freely chosen but the result of a bad environment, a bad government, or the devil.  Then one comes to the 21st chapter. Here, quite abruptly, is an older Alex who associates his youth with a wind-up toy (the opposite of moral freedom)!  One is also left wondering if Burgess actually believed at the time he wrote this novel that one INEVITABLY grows out of evil through some maturation process. If he did, then this contradicts the moral idea he presents in his introduction that one is free to choose evil and, I might add, stay evil.<br /><br />Apart from what I perceive to be a contradictory 21st chapter, the book is excellent for its creative language and emotional presentation on the moral issue of whether conditioning, not just incarceration, can remove moral freedom.  Put yourself in the victim's shoes.  Would you want Alex to lose his moral freedom to torture, rape or even murder if it meant a safer society, a safer YOU?  If you answer \\"yes,\\" then you are in effect saying that you want your own moral freedom to choose evil removed.  This raises the question of why evil (or our moral perception of evil) exists in the first place. A lot to think about here., not just incarceration, can remove moral freedom.  Put yourself in the victim's shoes.  Would you want Alex to lose his moral freedom to torture, rape or even murder if it meant a safer society, a safer YOU?  If you answer \\"yes,\\" then you are in effect saying that you want your own moral freedom to choose evil removed.

It points out that God is not obligated  to be merciful and He is not merciful to all.  Some people receive God's  justice (retributive justice, that is) and others receive His mercy.  Nobody gets injustice from God.  This is a sobering idea and Sproul uses  this distinction to expound on those biblical passages that show the  severity of God (the slaughter of Nadab and Abihu, Uzzah, the Canaanites,  etc).<br />I also appreciate the significant point he made about God alone  being eternal (without beginning or end).  Everything else was created by  God out of nothing and is sustained in existence by Him!  This point is  fundamental and powerful.  It refutes the idea of &quot;immutable natural  laws&quot; thereby allowing for miracles.  It also refutes the idea  underlying Deism that God created the universe and &quot;backed away.&quot;  God CAN'T back away without everything falling into nonexistence!  I could  go on and on, deducing more and more ideas from the ones presented in this  book.  But these are just a couple that laid a sure foundation in my mind.  A must read for every Christian (or non-Christian for that matter).	1998-08-13

The book is, as the title suggests, a presentation of CHRISTIAN ethics, so the Bible is taken as the standard text for discussing certain issues such as homosexuality, abortion, war/civil disobedience, and other similar ethical issues.  But scientific and rational arguments are also used in addition to Biblical exposition to reach conclusions.<br /><br />The first part of the book is concerned mainly with approaches to Ethics in general and Christian Ethics in particular.  After perusing the field and debunking moral relativism, Geisler concludes that the best ethical position is what he calls \\"Graded Absolutism.\\"  This basically means that certain situations require one to decide which of two conflicting absolutes to obey.  Geisler is sure to clarify that this is different than Situation Ethics (by Joseph Fletcher and others) which states that the situation determines the rule.  On the contrary, the graded nature of absolutes determines which rule to apply in a given situation.  Overall, a good read which still has me thinking and referring back to the book.	1998-08-10
US	52496001	R3RE99ITP3L991	0310704316	402848279	New Age Movement	Books	5	10	17	N	N	The Best Christian Resource on the New Age Movement	Ron Rhodes is well-known in the Christian Community for his excellent books on Cults and the New Age Movement (NAM).  The greatest thing about this book is that it consolidates the best information from Christian and non-Christian sources on NAM and provides concise and clear refutations of major New Age doctrines such as moral relativism, pantheism and reincarnation.<br />Non-Christians should be aware that the purpose of this book, and other books in this Zondervan series, is to refute anti-Christian beliefs and defend Christian ones.  But this shouldn't intimidate those New Agers who are sure about what they believe.  Even if they aren't convinced by the counter-arguments, they will find the book helpful to better understanding the NAM.  Also, the bibliography is excellent.<br />Check out the other books in this series, especially the ones on Satanism, Witchcraft, and Astrology.  All have the same concise outline format for easy reference.	1998-08-07
