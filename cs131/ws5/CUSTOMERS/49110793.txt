There is no denying that many of the stories from our region are sensational (indeed!) and all too often that is what we are left with.<br /><br />But I had high hopes for THE GLASS CASTLE, and was not disappointed.  Sensational the story is, but told with such wryness, such humility, without a shred of self-pity or sentimentality, I couldn't put the book down.  There were so many descriptions I found familiar -- the second floors too rotted to stand on them, the delight in hometown heros like Chuck Yeager.  There were passages that hurt to read, and passages to cheer.  Best of all, despite the bleakness, there were passages that made you laugh out loud, not only from the humor, but because you couldn't help but recognize something of yourself in them.<br /><br />Nothing pleases me more than another West Virginian making good - and this is a book about a side of America all too often forgotten or else misunderstood and used by both the left and the right.  Having made her own choices, Walls gives us her world to decide for ourselves.  I hope this book finds the many readers it deserves.	2005-04-12

I'm a stay at home mother who put her child into daycare so she could write from home (not unlike the author).  My husband works long hours.  But other than that, I am so NOT the women described here, that I can't help but feel a little outraged that the women described here are like \\"all\\" of \\"us.\\"<br /><br />Do I know overinvolved mothers?  Oh yes.  I knew one woman, who, after her son fell down hard while learning to walk, literally bent herself over backwards to hold his hands for two weeks.  She was afraid he'd be \\"disappointed\\" with his first experience of walking.  What?  Was she afraid she'd be the only mother with a child scooting off to kindergarten (assuming she made the decision not to send him to preschool or daycare beforehand) instead of walking?  To me, this form of motherhood has far more to do with the needs of these individual women than it does with motherhood in the twenty-first century.<br /><br />And as much as I agree that I would like to see more daycare options, better treatment of family issues for both men and women (I thought men were treated a bit stereotypically in this book -- I know plenty of fathers who are far far more involved than their fathers ever were and are proud to be so active in their children's lives) -- I don't believe that given the needs of the women here, a governmental solution is going to help these women or their families.  After all, these are the same women who insist that private school is better than public school because it gives their children an advantage -- what governmental program, by necessity geared for all women and all children, are these women going to find acceptable to them?<br /><br />I really wish I could have responded better to this work -- I agree that we could use a FEMININE MYSTIQUE for motherhood.  Unfortunately, Judith Warner is not Betty Friedan and A PERFECT MADNESS is not that book.t that book.	2005-03-29

For instance, the amount of medication our children are taking to make them \\"normal.\\" The rise of aggression in our youngest children. The rise in childhood obsesity, because we no longer live in a world where children play, outside of highly structured, controlled events.<br /><br />I don't disagree with anything descriptive she says about these issues. (And in fact, her chapter on GenX and Hip Hop music is quite well done.) But she blames this on a current culture where women (and men) leave their children in daycare, too focused on their own careers to care about them.<br /><br />And given her personal experience, there is much that probably bears this out. She lives in Washington DC, in a very nice, very expensive neighborhood. The mood around her is definitely a liberal, career driven one.<br /><br />However, I live in a red town, in a red county, in a red state. I live in a neighborhood of stay at home mothers, and fathers who are able to attend games and volunteer for boy scouting events. And what do I see? Children who are aggressive. Children who are obese. Children who are on medication. Most children do not play outside on our cul-de-sac because it \\"isn't safe.\\" (I honestly have no idea what that means -- it is far safer from anywhere else I've ever lived.)<br /><br />So even the right knows there is a problem with parenting. They blame the left, perhaps because they live in a left-wing world themselves. But for those of us who are NOT living in left-wing cultural milieus, those explanations fall flat.<br /><br />But the parenting problem remains in the US today. One of the few things the left and the right agree on.	2004-12-05

The character of Morgan Snow has so much to recommend her -- she's honest, she's thoughtful, intelligent and trying to do the \\"right\\" thing, without always knowing what that is.  She takes us into worlds where most of us have never been, but are likely curious about.  Even as she offers us insights into the world of her sex therapy patients (from the lowest street prostitutes to one of the highest paid and most beautiful call girls in the city) she never shies away from learning more about herself.  Definitely a character to watch!<br />MJ Rose certainly delivers on the details -- from the serial killings, to the descriptions of sex therapy, to the world of New York City that she obviously knows and loves.  This is a book that deserves a wide audience.	2004-07-01

If you're someone who enjoys the traditions of British comedy -- that dry wit, those sly double meanings, those self-depracating glances, then THE THIN PINK LINE is going to be a real treat!<br />British editor Jane, feeling a little insecure, is right on the money -- people ARE nicer to you when they see you're expecting a baby.  That she would want a little of that kindness isn't surprising, but how she goes about getting it is!  In the end, it isn't the baby who grows and changes over the course of the \\"pregnancy\\" but Jane herself.<br />A terrific book for anyone who has recently had a baby (and might really be in need of a lighter touch when it comes to motherhood!) or anyone who enjoys good comedy at its best.	2004-01-16

I agonized with Mary Beth, as she tried to make everything &quot;right&quot; around her, knowing that she couldn't, but trying none the less.<br />But what I enjoyed most about this book was the reading experience of it.  This is the type of novel where you will say, &quot;Oh, I'll just finish this chapter&quot; but when that time comes, you cheat.  &quot;I'll read one more....&quot;  The book is written so that you simply can't put the book down, which is my favorite type of book!	2003-05-01

But this book does something unique -- walks a patient through not only the personal side of what it means to work through the treatment, but offers informative, thoughtful and well-researched advice and suggestions.  From insurance, to diet, to treatment options, to, well, even hair, this book takes a good hard look at so many issues, yet Chartock (a breast cancer survivor herself) never loses sight of the compassionate side of the story.<br />Particularly helpful are the diary entries, which give the woman not only some suggested questions to ask her doctor about, but also space to write down the answers.  If you or someone you know is dealing with breast cancer, this is one book that will make the process just a little easier on the heart, soul and mind.	2003-01-12

But when their son James disappears in a magic trick, the comfortable world of the Woodrows disappears with him.<br />Ursu uses original and fantastic narrative styles to create for us characters who feel the way most of us would feel -- showing us that both the good and the bad of our lives often hangs in the shadow and celebration of \\"What if?\\"<br />A terrific follow-up novel the SPILLING CLARENCE!	2002-12-29

In this immensely readable biography, Lingeman brings us the Sinclair Lewis we have always wanted to admire, but perhaps never dared: the flawed, brash, idealistic cynic that put on the page a world as American as he was.  Over and over I was struck by how relevent the world of Lewis was, and how like our own it continues to be.<br />Neither heavily academic, nor breezy and light, this biography does exactly what it is supposed to do -- shines light upon a writer we remember, but never really knew.	2002-02-06

This is the sort of book that deserves a wide readership -- a book that is a privilege to read.  This is a book about the fundamental issues that make up our lives.  A book that makes you look up at the end and see your own world in a whole new way.<br />The characters in RIVER WOMAN are poignant, heartbreaking, yet rendered with such care and so real to the reader that they will resonate with you long after you close the covers.  The writing is wise -- gentle in places -- but ultimately as true to itself as the women are to the story.<br />This is a book that should have a wide reach.  I hope every opportunity is given to RIVER WOMAN and Ms. Hemans to find the readers this book deserves.	2002-01-25

The setting and time are ones that don't generally interest me. The characters (in their real lives) were obviously larger than life. So what else was there to say? In a word -- PLENTY. This book surprised me again and again. The women, drawn as bold and savvy as can be written. The setting and time intrinsic to the story, but not dated, for I was there -- right there -- as I followed this story along. And sure, the real life people from whom the characters were based were larger than life by the time I heard about them, but this book gave me a chance to meet and feel for them in a way I never could, reading about then in non-fiction. Gave me a chance to know them in a way. To suffer, to triumph, to cheer, to take comfort.	2001-08-26

While I found the book to be witty, and at times insightful, I couldn't quite escape the notion that these were not the women that I knew.  Women who register (if they do, in fact, register) at the local &quot;Bed Bath and Beyond&quot; alone (or with husband-to-be) with a scanner and a tablet of paper.  Women who buy dresses from catalogues or at the same store where they bought their prom dresses years ago.  Women, in other words, who live in the middle and lower classes.  Women who have worked for years, living on their own terms.  Women who are paying their own way -- including for their own weddings.<br />More and more women (and men) that I know have found that the expectations (often from guests) as to what is a &quot;proper&quot; wedding have made formal wedding harder to have, impossible to enjoy.  More and more have chosen small family affairs, or less showy ceremonies and receptions because the difference between spending 5 thousand on a wedding and using that money to put down on a house (you can still buy a house with a 5K downpayment in most of the country) is just too stark.<br />Again, the social history was interesting, but I do wish we could, as feminists, realize that just because we can (and always seem to) make sweeping generalizations, doesn't mean any of us speak for all women.	2001-07-10

Yet Mary Sharratt weaves a tale that is as timeless and as far reaching as any being written today.  Perhaps even more.<br />The intimate level of detail -- my favorite scene is Kathrin's first day at the mill -- belies a smoothly written storyline, a depth of character rarely found in first novels.

CLAY'S QUILT is filled with this stretching, this pushing, this growing and learning from experience and leaps of faith.<br />One is reminded of Jayne Anne Phillips novel MACHINE DREAMS, which told the story of young people coming of age in the Appalachian Mountains during the Vietnam War.  CLAY'S QUILT, set in Kentucky, moves us to the next chapter of our history, the next generation -- those born during or just after 1970.  Readers under thirty five will catch glimpses of themselves in this novel, while readers older will be given a moment of illumination of a world that they may not always understand.  But not matter what your age, no matter where you live, this is a novel that will strike a chord with the way we live and die and have our being.	2000-12-30

And after reading the book, I'm glad it's there, and this is a good start. The authors have many insights and personal stories which help frame their arguments -- some better than others, but they are MAKING arguments instead of answering those of others, which is a big step.<br />My biggest criticism is that I wish they knew more women -- at least the women that I tend to know, most of whom are young and consider themselves to be feminists.<br />I was reading about their dinner party, where they all &quot;bonded over STDs and abortions&quot; While these are important issues, they do not loom over the lives of most women.  The statistic that 1 out of every two people will encounter an STD and that 43% of women will have an abortion does not factor in that many women who find themselves in either situation will find themselves there more than once.  (I highly recommend Susan Faludi's book BACKLASH to learn how to read statistics.)	2000-10-30

A love of people in our lives  so strong that we would rather simply have that love, than to question it,  to risk its loss.	2000-09-01

But unlike so many of the other excellent books in the Twayne series, this one seemed to have an agenda all  its own.  While the ideas discussed were very interesting (a sort of new  age, feminist perspective) I didn't feel it was quite right for something  like Twayne, which has always been more of an overarching perspective of an  individual writer's work.<br />I felt that I was reading someone's thesis -- a  well written one, but something that was about the micro, not macro themes  and ideas behind Smith's work.	2000-07-24
