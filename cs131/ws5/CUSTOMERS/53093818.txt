He never killed for the sake of killing, but had no qualms about dispatching anyone who was an enemy.  Attack one of his own, though and you are in trouble. Kern is such a man.  Loyal to a fault, able to overcome his fears and loved by his brother Cimmerians, he is a great succesor to Conan.  A stranger among his kin, with his white hair and golden eyes, he is like Conan in a way as Conan was a stranger among Aquilonians, who he became king of, Kern is a great leader.<br /><br />The setting of the story is Cimmeria in the time of Conan the King, who is mentioned in the book.  If we are lucky he will make an appearance in future volumes.  I will not spoil it, but suffice it to say, Cimmeria has a new hero!  I can hardly wait to read Volume 2!	2005-07-06

He makes tha case for the world's flatness, then goes about tearing apart much of his own thinking by pointing out that much of the Third World is not flat and will never be flat if things do not change.  Unlike some readers, I do not think that he uniformly sings the praises of Globalization; he attempts to present it in a way not only evonomists and such can understand it, but so others may.<br /><br />Yes, he states the obvious at certain points; the computer revolution and the Internet have irrevocably changed our world, but that does not mean it should not be restated.  As a result of all these things we are challenged and will continue to be challenged by other countries, like China and India. That does not mean we should give up and I don't think we will, but that does not mean that we should not hear the alarm bells.<br /><br />No, he does not like the Bush administration, but that does not mean that I cannot listen to  him and his ideas about the world.  Listening is how we learn; closing your mind will never teach you anything.<br /><br />A good read, as long as you do not expect him to solve all the world's problems!	2005-06-20

He has managed to end a series in a way that is both satisfying and fitting, one of the things many authors simply cannot seem to do.  OK, there could be more, but this is definitely a great book, tying together more in its few pages than we fans have a right to expect.<br /><br />No spoiler here, just a recommendation that if you have read and enjoyed any of the other DS books, you need to read the rest!!<br /><br />I love everything Green writes and this was no exception.	2005-02-07

Sometimes the resolution of the suspense is a little too easy, but other times it is very exciting and rewarding.

There are idiots and twits in every profession, mine included.<br /><br />But, it tells a very interesting and captivating story about a little old lady in very improbable circumstances who, in the end, finds herself and a new meaning in her life.<br /><br />Read it...

I have read a lot of SF and fantasy and found this hard to get into at times.  It took me a long time to finish the book, but in the end it was worth every minute of it.  Gene Wolfe is truely a genius as a writer and has woven a tapestry of mystery and adventure.  Able is a likeable, if exasperating hero, with a lot of potential.  The ending of this book is a surprise, but then, so were many of the major events.  Nothing is predicable about this book, nothing.  If you want an adventure for your brain, this is the one.

If you want to know the origins of the problems and promise that is modern Mexico, then this is the book to read.  It is, at its heart, a scholarly work with a lot of information and good references.  The author is sympathetic toward the people of Mexico, but also lets the reader know about their weaknesses and foibles.  A country with great a great future if only it allows itself to have it, Mexico is important for we Notre Americos to know about.	2004-10-09

He tells it like he saw it, with little or no embellishment.

Christopher talks about what it is like to be on the sharp tip of the spear day after day after day, with little rest.  Leadership in such circumstances takes its toll.  He survived somehow despite all of his close calls.

Ralph needed a better editor who could sit down and help him focus more.  Some of the stories are great and in some cases would make a great book in themselves, but the writing style takes it out of the realm of serious history and relegates it to populist history; very enjoyable, but still populist history, which is what I think Ralph was shooting for.<br />Having read Tank Sergeant I knew this was not War and Peace.  No one who is not a tanker or in the CAV will relate to his point of view well, making it a book with a limited audience, but one that tankers and anyone interested in cavalry and its history should read.<br />Armor, cavalry and the concepts involved in this book are real, very real and current.  Cavalry, as demostrated time and time again in this book and history, is a mindset, not a set of hardware or type of vehicle.  From the battle of Kadesh to the 1st Cavalry in Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, cavalry has led the way and provided the point of the spear.  Ralph Zumbro has made a valiant attempt at writing a history of the modern armored cavalry and we should applaud him for that.<br />Read it, but don't expect it to be a scholarly work!	2003-08-10

I have read all of the prequels written by the son and they are all good books.  I liked every one of them.  Were they classic literature?  No, but they caught the spirit of the story and gave the classic Dune a starting point.<br />This book tells us about the Titans, the thinking machines and the humans who fought them.  Is is perfect?  No, it is not, but it is very readable and the characters seemed real to me.<br />Quit complaining... this is stil a mile better than most stuff written today.  I put it up there with David Weber and his like, if not better than most of the current military sci-fi, which it is.  Dune and its sequels was more hard-core sci-fi; this is military sci-fi at its best.	2003-01-28

The previous reviewer missed the point.  As an Executive Officer Mike Mahler was second in command, and often on-site commander of the unit.  In this position he also had a lot of day-to-day contact with supporting and supported units.  This is not a blood and guts account of fighting tanks, but one of how Armored Cavalry works.  As a former Armored Cav Officer it was a great read and Colonel Mahler did a great job of explaining the complexities and challenge of Cavalry Operations.  I wish I had had officers as good as he was commanding me.<br />As to not ID'ing the unit, that is his choice and I will not fault him for it.  Maybe he just did not want to drag up the names of dead or incompetent officers.  Who knows.<br />If I could I would love to talk with the Colonel one on one about his experiences.  Great book for anyone interested in Armored Cavalry.	2002-12-28

Other than that, it is a good book about how the forward edge of the spear operates, survives and how important it is to the outcome of battle.  As an officer I found it lacking in an overall view of the battle that frustrated me at times, but then I realize it is supposed to be about the scout, not the battle as a whole.  Given its limitations, it is a good, quick read.  I read it in one weekend... I recommoned it.	2002-09-22

If you like good heros who are not perfect great battle stories that are operationally and tactically believable... then this is for you.<br />The Posleen are a bit much and there is no translation for the Posleen words.

The hell that Guy Sajer went through is nothing like anything I could have imagined.  I am a former officer, a US Army Armor Major and I never fought a day.  Sometimes I felt somehow cheated.. until I read this book and learned the truth of the matter.  There is no glory or honor in modern war, if there ever was, just survival.

This was a good book, coming of the heels of the other two books of the series.  I found it to be fast paced, but not as tight at The Soldier of Fear (#2).  The characterizations, the suspense and the twists of the plot were all done well.  The stage was well set by the other two and Graf has carried it off well.  Well worth the read, if you like the DS9 crew.  They are at their best in this one	1996-08-12
