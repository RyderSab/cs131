It is, additionally, the book upon which the recent Oscar-nominated (Best Foreign Film) \\"Downfall\\" with Bruno Ganz (as Hitler) was based.<br /><br />Mr. Fest's narrative races along like a well-tuned Aston Martin - indeed, the book almost reads like a page-turning best-selling novel - and sweeps the reader up in heartbreaking and senseless death and madness. I've since gone on to read other works by Mr. Fest and have been well-pleased. I highly recommend this one, no matter WHAT you know about Adolf Hitler's final days and hours. -	2005-03-10

Watching this, it was as though the writer, the director and Ms. Thompson (is there a FINER actress on the planet right now?) had mined my mother's brain unbeknownst to me as she lay dying in a hospital in order to show me - compassionately, humanely yet SO dramatically and angonizingly - the other side of death.  One might have titled it \\"The Other Side of Dying\\".<br /><br />One watches loved ones die and one is concentrated upon one's own grief and feelings; \\"Wit\\" takes you over the fence, makes you trod the ground over which the dying patient walks with increasingly faltering steps, right up until the end.  \\"Wit\\" is not easy viewing; but - from the agonies of its main character, to the ineptutide and shocking lack of compassion by all the medical staff save Audra McDonald's character - it is necessary viewing in a time when insurance and the medical community say they care, but don't act as though they do.  One is reminded that \\"pure research\\" can never be such, because its results flow from the faults and frailties of the human body and experience.  A tour de force performance from a first-rate cast.	2005-02-16

Halliday's \\"Understanding Thomas Jefferson\\" is not your standard biography of our third president.  It does not fawn, nor does it marbleize Jefferson as some untouchable, unknowable, walking mystery so impenatrable that none but the most scholarly of biographers dare touch him.<br /><br />What you come away with from this book is a sense that you know Jefferson just a bit better or, barring that, you at least have had a light shown upon areas of his life not heretofore illuminated for fear that doing so might \\"cut him down to size\\", make him merely mortal.<br /><br />Halliday takes us through just about all the phases of Jefferson's life, from his youthful years, through his marriage, his various relationships with the three main women in his life (outside of his daughters):  his wife, Martha, Maria Cosway and Sally Hemings.  He shows us Jefferson's stormy relationship with Alexander Hamilton while the former served as Secretary of State and the latter Secretary of the Treasury in Washington's cabinet.<br /><br />He unsparingly comments on previous, \\"god-like\\" biographers of Jefferson, including Dumas Malone and Merrill Peterson, pointing out their (to him) flaws and blindnesses (especially on the subject of Sally Hemings).  He steers the reader in other directions of thought that these men did not see fit to address, which failure, as Halliday would have it, presents an incomplete picture of their celebrated subject and cheats posterity of a history which is \\"meaningful\\".<br /><br />There are blunt discussions and speculations upon the nature of Jefferson's sexual development, both before, during and after his ten years of relative marital bliss with Martha Wayles Skelton.  If you are someone who just cannot abide the thought that Jefferson had a sexual and, apparently, long-term and loving relationship with Sally Hemings (despite acknowledged DNA evidence to the contrary), or who thinks that after Martha Jefferson's death, her husband turned off his sexual desires like one turns off a kitchen faucet and became an emotionless stone statue, then perhaps this book might not be your cup of tea.<br /><br />Try it anyway.  Mr. Halliday makes his case rationally, calmly and gradually, debunking a few things and confirming others along the way, for example, rendering the supposedly \\"long-lasting\\" passion of Jefferson for Maria Cosway (the married English lady with whom he flirted - and we really don't know what else - while he was ambassador in Paris) much shorter than it actually was, primarily because ... well, Maria was apparently a bit of a fluff-head.  And you can well imagine that Jefferson, of all people, with his love of learning and books and education, could not long have endured a ditzy female.<br /><br />If you had read nothing about Jefferson, and wanted to use this as a first introduction to the man, I'd discourage it, recommending that you read at least one other \\"mainstream\\" conventional biography before reading E. M. Halliday's work in order to see the sharp contrast between the two resources.  If you approach Thomas Jefferson in that fashion, then Halliday's honesty and open style, as well as his obvious desire that history consider all aspects of its subject, no matter how unthinkable or \\"forbidden\\", will become, I believe, quite appealing.<br /><br />You will find this book a refreshing look at one of the most respected figures in American history, no less so because he is examined unsparingly and who, while found wanting in some aspects of his life, emerges less of an enigma and more of an \\"every man\\" than most biographies of Jefferson would have you to believe.sexual desires like one turns off a kitchen faucet and became an emotionless stone statue, then perhaps this book might not be your cup of tea.

We are so accustomed to thinking of Mr. Jefferson (when we think of him at all in our history-shunning American society) as merely the writer of the Declaration of Independence (as if such an achievement could ever be marginalized by the word \\"merely\\") or, worse still, as only a remote, two-dimensional figure whose head appears on our nickel.  We forget (if we have indeed ever been taught to begin with) his many other sides, dimensions, aspects.<br />Michael Beran gifts us with a Founding Father just as subject to anxiety, joy, depression, optimism and grief as the rest of us mortals.  His doomed romance with Mrs. Cosway, his trials with Alexander Hamilton, his love of family and, of course, his controversial relationship with his slave, Sally Hemings, all combine to present a human, flawed yet ultimately triumphant example of the human spirit.<br />Upon reading this book, one feels he knows Mr. Jefferson a bit better, even though some mysteries remain.  As Mr. Beran writes in his thoughts on Jefferson's relationship wht Ms. Hemings, \\"Yet even if the fact of his paternity could be established beyond all doubt, we would still know almost nothing about the nature of the master's relationship with his slave.  The quality of those intimacies, their tenderness or their brutality, is lost to history.  Jefferson's love of Mrs. Cosway is eternally preserved in the words he wrote to her and she to him, but unless lost documents come to light, his unlanguaged transactions with Sally Hemings must forever remain dumb to the curious inquirer.\\"  One wonders if, one hundred or so years from now, there will be an historian who will look upon Bill Clinton's indiscretions with as much wisdom and candor and as little sensationalization.<br />With graceful prose that sypathetically reveals Thomas Jefferson's inner being without avoiding the frailties which puncture his character - as perhaps judged by us today in a different time and place - along with his incongruities of character - and, of course, his own brilliance, \\"Jefferson's Demons\\" is a thoughtful study of a man whose essence often eludes us in this fast-paced, modern world, where men of his intellectual calibre seem very few and far between.hat sypathetically reveals Thomas Jefferson's inner being without avoiding the frailties which puncture his character - as perhaps judged by us today in a different time and place - along with his incongruities of character - and, of course, his own brilliance, \\"Jefferson's Demons\\" is a thoughtful study of a man whose essence often eludes us in this fast-paced, modern world, where men of his intellectual calibre seem very few and far between.	2003-11-13

However, for someone - like me - for whom Jackson has long been an object of fascination but, regretfully, not someone that I was taught about in school or have had time to research on my own, I found the slender book detailed here the perfect introduction to &quot;Sharp Knife&quot; (the Indian nickname for Jackson.)<br />Mr. Remini hits the high points (Jackson's origins, his role in the Revolutionary War, his courtship/marriage to Rachel Robards, his role in Indian affairs and the battle of New Orleans, as well as his two terms as President) in an efficient, informal manner.  Stylistically, the book's contents are a broad brush-stroke, designed to provide a &quot;jumping-off point&quot; for the reader who is little-or-unacquainted with Jackson.<br />Once you complete this book, if you still don't feel up to the challenge of the 3-volume work, I recommend the one-volume abridgement of same, entitled &quot;The Life Of Andrew Jackson&quot; (ISBN No. 0060937351), which gives even more detail and background than this &quot;introductory&quot; Jackson biography.<br />By the time you read both of these, you'll be well ready to jump feet-first into Mr. Remini's classic multi-volume masterpiece and further indulge what will surely have become an even greater fascination with the Hero of New Orleans.	2002-08-09

I'm tempted to not read any further because part of me hopes that, by not reading about the cowardly murder committed in Ford's Theatre by John Wilkes Booth, it somehow will not have happened.  Lincoln will have successfully completed his second term in office, Reconstruction will have been an entirely different animal than it turned out to be and this country would be vastly different as a result.<br />Reaching the end of Gore Vidal's masterful \\"Lincoln\\", I felt even more squeamish, but for a different reason:  in this novel, I'd heard Lincoln speak, both to himself and to others; I'd walked with him through the corridors of the White House; looked on as he met with Grant, Sherman and Porter at City Point towards the end of the war; pitied him his domestic burdens of an unstable wife and and the loss of his youngest son, Willie; and I'd witnessed first-hand the insubordination - both covert and overt - of his Cabinet, his staff and his generals and wondered how any man so little supported could have achieved the return of the South to the Union.  He had become my friend, my companion and, as Booth pulled the trigger of his gun, I ached for Lincoln and mourned his loss in the most intimate of ways.<br />A writer that can make a reader feel that way has, in my opinion, truly accomplished something.  Vidal's \\"Lincoln\\" takes the reader back into history and makes him/her a part not only of events, but of the thoughts of all the major players during the Civil War.  Emphasis is placed on events in Washington, DC, rather than on the battlefields, so one doesn't get much about Grant, Sherman, etc. until the novel's end.  But, again, this is about Lincoln - the man, the husband and most of all, the canny, shrewd politician. Vidal shows him subtly manipulating his warring Cabinet members like so many pieces on a chessboard, then gives us another character (Secretary John Hay, for example) watching his Commander-In-Chief's actions and evaluating them.<br />Vidal's narrative style is that of a camera slowly circling the room, focusing first on one character then, as that character approaches or mentions another, easily moving to that next person, linking all the events of 1861-1865 into a long chain of inevitabilties, surging forward into the climax of the death of Lincoln at Ford's Theatre and his passing into legend and into history.<br />This novel gives us the MAN, who is often forgotten amid the laurel wreaths and marble statues.  Lincoln hurt, laughed, plotted, prayed, grieved and, eventually, triumphed and Gore Vidal's \\"Lincoln\\" takes you along for the ride.<br />Enjoy!  I cannot recommend this novel highly enough.nother character (Secretary John Hay, for example) watching his Commander-In-Chief's actions and evaluating them.<br />Vidal's narrative style is that of a camera slowly circling the room, focusing first on one character then, as that character approaches or mentions another, easily moving to that next person, linking all the events of 1861-1865 into a long chain of inevitabilties, surging forward into the climax of the death of Lincoln at Ford's Theatre and his passing into legend and into history.<br />This novel gives us the MAN, who is often forgotten amid the laurel wreaths and marble statues.

Alison Weir, as usual, offers this thoroughly-detailed, sometimes amusing, sometimes heartbreaking portrait of a man who, thwarted at nearly every turn from getting a queen who could produce strapping male heirs to the Throne of England, descended from a jolly, back-slapping prince to a fat, cruel and nearly despotic king, whose final wish to be buried alongside Jane Seymour must have cut his final surviving wife, Katherine Parr, to the quick.<br />But, as the title suggests, the primary thrust of this book is not so much Henry VIII as each of his unfortunate wives.  One learns a great deal more about them than the usual lines given by armchair historians.  For example, &quot;saintly&quot; Jane Seymour, usually depicted as a meek and mild young thing, was just as much a deliberate factor in the downfall of Anne Boleyn as her royal husband-to-be.  And as one reads about Anne Boleyn's temper, one teeters between sympathy for her and ... a vague feeling that perhaps Henry beheaded her not so much for failing to produce an heir as to get her to shut up and cease her constant nagging and ill-tempered outbursts.  (Of course, then you swing back into Anne's camp, figuring anyone living with someone like Henry would be ill-tempered ... or perhaps worse!)<br />And so it goes ...<br />Fascinating, chock full of details of court life and rife with facts from many primary sources, Alison Weir's account of Henry VIII and his wives remains a standard of its genre.	2002-05-09

Both women are thoroughly versed in the life of their royal subject, and obviously enthusiastic about her as well.<br />Erickson's style, however, leans more toward novelistic narrative.  She seems to be sitting with you, telling you a story about this great monarch with her infamous \\"virgin\\" status, her political adeptness, her fearsome temper, her penchant for swearing oaths that made one's blood freeze, and her ability to command deep love and adoration from her subjects.<br />This style is especially appealing for those for whom this biography is their first foray into Tudor biography.  It introduces the major players in the queen's life thoroughly so that one is well acquainted with Robert Dudley, Cecil and Walsingham, as well as Mary I and the many other colorful characters that populated the Queen's life.  You also get a real feel for the terror and uncertainty of Elizabeth's youth, when she lived in fear of death at the hands of her unstable, Catholic sister.<br />Erickson adroitly paints a stunning (and sometimes shocking) picture of life at court - and what a life it must have been.  Living at the various castles Elizabeth moved between (they changed castles regularly so that the one previously used could be cleaned and \\"aired out\\") was far from our 21st century idea of luxury, and when you read about the trials and travails inherent in the Queen's annual \\"progresses\\", you'll never gripe about rush-hour traffic again!<br />Again, I would recommend this to anyone starting out to read about Elizabeth I, and to the reader already familiar with the life of the greatest queen of England.  Those of the latter group might find that the author falls in love a bit too much with her subject (and who wouldn't, as this lady is one of the most fascinating people in history).  In some places towards the end the flow of the narrative (going from event to event) isn't quite as seamless as it could be (you feel as though you are jumping from one to the other without a lead-in sentence/paragraph) but never mind that.  Erickson does a marvelous job of painting a portrait of the life and times of Elizabeth and it's a most pleasurable learning experience and enjoyable read.<br />After finishing \\"Elizabeth I\\", the reader would do well to continue on with Weir's biography mentioned above.

I've always wondered about Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock Holmes's mysterious sibling.  He appeared only in a few of Conan Doyle's stories and (if I remember correctly) made an appearance in Nicholas Meyer's &quot;The Seven Percent Solution&quot;.  However, until now, Mycroft has remained largely in the background, a figure on the periphery of Sherlock's better-documented exploits.<br />Fortunately for us, author Quinn Fawcett, with endorsement by none other than Dame Jean Conan Doyle herself, has fashioned a new crime series which pulls Mycroft from the shadows and into his rightful place in detective fiction.  &quot;Against The Brotherhood&quot;, the first novel in Fawcett's series, also introduces the reader to Mycroft's capable secretary Paterson Guthrie, his worthy houseman Philip Tyers and a stimulating new cast of characters and villains that is worthy both of the Conan Doyle family endorsement and the regard and enjoyment of the millions of faithful Sherlock devotees.<br />In &quot;Against The Brotherhood&quot;, Mycroft and Guthrie find themselves pitted against a mysterious, blood-thirsty organization of ruthless men, set on destroying the world's great governments through various underhanded, clandestine and (quite often) murderous and bloody methods.  The novel contains many hair-raising moments, as Mycroft sends Guthrie undercover to penetrate the mysterious &quot;Brotherhood&quot; and, in so doing, puts his secretary's life at stake for, if Guthrie's real identity is discovered by the very group he is trying to infiltrate, they will stop at nothing to silence him - forever, and in VERY nasty ways.<br />In fashioning Mycroft Holmes (who has sometimes been called &quot;Sherlock's smarter brother&quot;), Fawcett gives us not so much a smarter sibling (for to be sure, brains run in that family in spades) but a &quot;kinder, gentler&quot; sibling.  He is brilliant without his brother's arrogance, and more human.  There is far less of Sherlock's chilly remoteness, and one senses that Mycroft is psychologically better-adjusted than his brother, who has many inner demons driving him.  The two, when compared together, make a stimulating contrast.<br />Likewise, Guthrie is no Watson, although he, like Watson, faithfully records the exploits of his employer.  Each of Guthrie's chapters is capped by an entry from Tyers's private diary, which provides extra information about the main plot while spinning a side plot concerning the approaching death of Tyers's elderly mother.  Guthrie is a courageous character, willing to do more than what's required of him and able to stand his ground in a tight spot.  And there are plenty of those in &quot;Against The Brotherhood&quot;.<br />I've just started the second Mycroft Holmes novel, &quot;Embassy Row&quot;, fast on the heels of completing this one, and I'm finding that situations, characters and references carry over from one novel to the next.  Therefore, I believe it would be best to begin this series at the beginning, with &quot;Against The Brotherhood&quot;, in order to follow the references to past exploits that will be made in future novels.<br />I definitely feel that Sherlock Holmes fans will appreciate the new focus on his brother, Mycroft, and Quinn Fawcett has done an excellent job in breathing life into a little-known literary creation.

James's prose lacks the elegance of P. D. James.  You sense the tortured psyches of the characters without the author's guidance through them, as Ian Rankin guides you through the cluttered mind of John Rebus.  Some might be put off by the British colloquialisms, unfamilar police terms, British slang ...<br />Don't let any of that stop you from reading &quot;Roses, Roses&quot; anyway.<br />This novel is the first one in Bill James's Harpur &amp; Iles series that I personally have read.  Several have gone before, revealing the tangled lives of these people; Harpur, a womanizer of legendary proportions and a good policeman, and Iles, whose wife was at some point in the past one of Harpur's conquests.  It's like a huge intermarried family, this series of characters.  Everyone's related to someone else and all their lives touch - usually at sensitive and painful points.<br />This novel was recommended to me on Amazon based on my affection for the aforementioned P. D. James and Ian Rankin, and I must say it - and its author - deserve to be included in the ranks of such premier English mystery writers.<br />The plot you can get a summary of here at Amazon.com.  My impressions, however, you get here.  Nobody's sugared up or perfected in this book.  Everyone's got dirty hands - and not just the detectives, but their spouses and their grasses and everyone else, except possibly Harpur's two daughters, who are well on their way to jaded viewpoints produced courtesy of seeing what their father does for a living.  What the reader gets is a stimulating collection of street-wise characters who are way too human - perhaps even repellant at times - but who never leave a false note hanging in the air.  The author has a clean, stripped-down narrative style that eschews unnecessary detail and keeps the pace tight in the right places at all times.<br />I disagree with the prior reviewer that the flashbacks to Harpur's wife, Megan, during her last hours and before that, as she makes her illicit trips to London to meet with her lover and Harpur's ex-partner, don't work.  They do.  You get present and past seamlessly woven together; one fleshes out the other, each makes the other more understandable.  When you're with Megan in that dark car park at 2 AM, just moments before her grisly death, voyeuristically watching her mental acrobatics as she attempts to figure out how to deal with the shadowy figure lurking close by while examining the past with her lover and slowly puting together the realization that something might be dreadfully wrong, the suspense morphs into a genuine sympathy for a character who might all too easily be dismissed by the phrase &quot;she got what was coming to her&quot;.<br />I'm going to go back &amp; read James' entire Harpur &amp; Iles series, form beginning to end.  If &quot;Roses, Roses&quot; is any example of what I'll find when I do, I'll be a highly delighted and satisfied reader well into the year 2002.<br />If you're looking for a mystery series - and a set of characters - whose uniqueness, blend and taste are not only enjoyable but DIFFERENT, I suggest you run, don't walk, to Bill James's Harpur &amp; Iles series.t hours and before that, as she makes her illicit trips to London to meet with her lover and Harpur's ex-partner, don't work.

Casting about for a new mystery author (and having consumed P. D. James' latest, &quot;Death In Holy Orders&quot;), I decided to give Prof. Tamar a try.<br />I just finished the book and I found it most delightful.  It contains a very brilliantly-constructed conundrum of the &quot;whodunnit&quot; variety.  Julia Larwood, one of a group of young barristers who are friends with Prof. Tamar, goes to Venice on holiday, only to wind up in bed with the corpse of the young man she's fancied throughout the trip and finally managed to engage in a one-afternoon stand.  (Of course, when she first got into bed with the young man, he WASN'T a corpse, which makes his subsequent dispatch all the more distressing ...)  Naturally, members of the Venice police force don't take kindly to this set of events, particularly when Julia's personally-inscribed copy of that year's Tax Finance Act is found lying next to the stiffening body ...<br />From London, then, Prof. Tamar and Julia's other friends at 62 New Square (Selena, Cantrip and Ragwort - all intriguing personalities in themselves) attempt to help solve the mystery and spring Julia out of jail.  What follows is an erudite, often hilarious, web of intrigue, frustrated passion and outright chicanery told in VERY tongue-in-cheek style by Prof. Tamar himself ... or herself ...<br />Come to think of it, you never know the sex of our intrepid narrator.  Ms. Caudwell has neither Tamar or his compatriots refer to him/her in any way that might reveal the Professor's sex.  And that's just one of the subtle plot contrivances that make &quot;Thus Was Adonis Murdered&quot; a delightful read.<br />Sadly, Ms. Caudwell died recently, so her series turned out to be all-too-short.  Therefore, I'm beginning the second novel, &quot;The Shortest Way To Hades&quot;, featuring the elegant professor and the barristers of 62 New Square, quite slowly, so as not to finish all the books in the series too quickly and to savour the wonderful prose and imaginative situation I'm very likely to find there.ny way that might reveal the Professor's sex.

It's chock-full of information on every aspect of the breed, from its history to methods of care, information on showing and breeding and an additional section on Somalis, the long-haired version of the Aby.  It's down-to-earth, sensible and one can tell the author's love of the breed clearly from her words.<br />Before getting an Aby - a highly intelligent, active and social cat who needs  lots of love and attention - one would do well to give this book serious study.  Know what you're getting into and the Aby will reward you with a life of insanity, activity and lots of LOVE!  But don't buy an Aby thinking this is a &quot;cat that will take care of itself&quot;.  As Ms. Faler notes in this book, it is a people-loving breed that will flourish best in a home where it is not &quot;just a pet&quot;, but an integral, adored member of the family.	2001-07-17

James is, without doubt, the greatest living mystery writer today.  Bar none.  &quot;Death In Holy Orders&quot;, her latest Adam Dalglish offering, merely cements this fact - as if it needed it.<br />The body of a young ordinand is discovered, smothered by a collapse of sand, on the beach near St. Anselem's, a theological college on the lonely shores of East Anglia.  Ironically, St. Anselem's was also a particularly important place in Dalglish's boyhood and, when he is called to investigate this shocking murder, his journey there represents in microcosm the disparity between the new England and the old, the former way of living butting heads with the new, a theme carried delicately throughout the book in many ways, including the characters and how they live and think.<br />Subsequently, two more murders are committed - the last a most gruesome, shocking dispatching taking place in the chapel of all places - and Dalglish calls in Kate Miskin and company to assist him in finding the perpetrator.<br />A new twist added here is the subtle romantic situation occurring in the background between Dalglish and one of the people staying at the college during the murders.  The ending is more satisfying than &quot;A Certain Justice&quot; and I liked the fact that Ms. James alludes to Dalglish's feelings about the end of the matter written about in &quot;Justice&quot;.  He feels he failed, somehow, and these feelings make finding this latest killer an even more urgent matter - not only to stop him killing again, but to reassure Dalglish that justice does, indeed, come around more often than not.<br />A wonderful novel from a terrific writer.	2001-05-24

I stumbled on Bruce Alexander's series of novels concerning Sir John Fielding and his irrepressible assistant, young Jeremy Proctor, quite by accident one day as I was browsing Amazon with no clue what I wanted to read or buy.  I just knew I was looking for something different and exciting, and I wanted a mystery.  What I got, once I happened upon Alexander's first novel of the series, &quot;Blind Justice&quot;, was a superior historical novel with a first-rate mystery and many-dimensional characters built in.<br />The plot summary of &quot;Blind Justice&quot; you can read here, so I won't go into it again, other than to say that young Jeremy travels to London following his father's tragic death to seek his way in the world as a printer.  Mistaken for a thief and falsely accused, Jeremy is brought before Magistrate Sir John Fielding's Bow Street court, proves his innocence and is made a ward of the court by none other than Sir John himself, a character who actually existed (he was the brother of Henry Fielding - author of the famous novel &quot;Tom Jones&quot; - and the man responsible for the founding of the Bow Street Runners, London's very first police force.)  Not long after this, the body of Lord Goodhope is found shot dead in a locked library, and thus begins a partnership that is both inspiring and highly entertaining.<br />I am now reading the fifth book in the series, &quot;Jack, Knave and Fool&quot;, having finished &quot;Blind Justice&quot;, &quot;Murder In Grub Street&quot;, &quot;Watery Grave&quot; and &quot;Person or Persons Unknown&quot; one right behind the other.  I can say with complete sincerity that each book brings a new and suspenseful plot combined with the author's superior eye for the details of the period.  Mr. Alexander makes Georgian-era London as visible to the mind's eye as accurately as any photograph might have - the markets, the bawds on the street, the scamps and thieves and the high-and-low born people who pass through Sir John's court are most memorable and oftentimes quite humorous.  The regular characters evolve well throughout the series and young Jeremy is a most reliable and mature narrator.<br />Start your trip through Georgian London with Sir John and Master Jeremy Proctor in &quot;Blind Justice&quot; and, once you do, you'll be picking up the second installment, &quot;Murder In Grub Street&quot;, soon enough.court are most memorable and oftentimes quite humorous.

In the 1950s and 1960s, many areas of America were frighteningly conservative and tightly closed to anything new or experimental in literature.  Grove Press was an exception and now, viewed with historical hindsight, one can thank God that they were.<br />Some entries were banned; others censored when they originally appeared.  Some, read now, appear tame and one wonders why the subject matter caused such a fuss.  Others, like Burroughs &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;, still stir the dark places within those who read it, with its gripping, uncompromising prose and frighteningly realistic and powerful portrayals of realities which today we've grown far too accustomed to reading about - drug addiction, violence or the confusion of living in a world that pressures its inhabitants to conform rather than let loose their own imaginative worlds without fear of reprisal.<br />&quot;The Grove Press Reader&quot; is an invaluable collection of literature, particularly for those - like me - who may sometimes feel intimidated by these writers.  This gives an excellent overall introduction to their works and, as a bonus, boasts an explicit history of the publishing company and the efforts of its owners and staff to ensure that good writing - no matter by whom - was brought to the public.	2001-04-17

When he left, he became the last man of his race to be elected to Congress during the post-Reconstruction era, leaving a void which would not be filled for nearly 30 years (North Carolina didn't elect another African-American to Congress until 1992).  White became, sadly, an historical footnote.<br />Benjamin Justesen has performed an intense labor of love in resurrecting White's story.  Armed with prodigious amounts of careful research - reflected in the copious footnotes sprinkled throughout the text - and his own personal determination to bring this biography to public attention, Justesen has realized his dream of writing George Henry White's life story after becoming acquainted with his subject while working as a reporter in the 1970s.<br />He brings to life the issues and prejudices of the period, which only serve to magnify the high principles to which White held himself.  Believing that education and one's own hard work got one where one wanted to go, White proved his beliefs in a time when Southern public sentiment was gradually moving into its shameful Jim Crow era.<br />A lawyer, politician, banker, real estate developer, family man and man of faith, George Henry White is a model for anyone today - black or white - who thinks, &quot;I cannot.&quot;  His life is an example to us all, and his biography a fascinating look at both a man and an era in Southern history.	2001-02-27

However, we are now in the year 2001, and the book is in danger of becoming outdated with regard to its price guides and the values of Steiff collectibles.  Additionally, many new bears and animals have been made since 1990 but are not included in this edition, except for the Disney animals up to 1995.<br />A new, revised and up-to-2000 or 2001 3rd edition needs to be released ASAP.<br />In the meantime, puzzled Steiff collectors should look for a copy of &quot;Steiff Sortiment 1947-1999&quot; by Gunther Pfeiffer.  (&quot;Sortiment&quot; here means &quot;Assortment&quot;.)  When used in conjunction with Mr. Consalvi's book, both provide a comprehensive look at Steiff's many world-famous toys, both old and new, but Pfeiffer's price guides are accurate up to 1999.

I started backwards when I had to review &quot;The Hatbox Baby&quot;.  Then, I moved backward on my own through &quot;Lamb In Love&quot; and now &quot;Rose's Garden&quot;.<br />I confess I didn't harken to &quot;Rose's Garden&quot; at first.  It seemed slower than the other two novels - slower in a way that was more appealing in Ms. Brown's last two offerings.  But having read her other works, I felt I could trust her to lead me where I was supposed to be going, and she did.<br />The story of Conrad's widowhood - how he copes with the loneliness, the pain and his fears of moving on through life without his beloved Rose - is pretty devastating to read.  Such are Ms. Brown's writing abilities that I think even if you have not lost a spouse, you can feel the weight of her character's absolute grief without any trouble.  At these times, when one instinctively wants to pull back, to grasp that which is lost to the physical world, the best cure often lies in reaching outward, towards the future.  Conrad's increasing awareness of the strength and depth of Rose's love, coupled with the renewing power that comes when he takes his own love and flings it into the air like one of his beloved homing pigeons, is remarkable.  Like his birds, who return to settle on his outstretched arms, Conrad finds his love winging back towards him in ways he neither expects nor anticipates but which come as no surprise to the reader of &quot;Rose's Garden&quot;.<br />If you remain patient through the first 100 pages, you'll be richly rewarded.  As with &quot;Lamb In Love&quot; and &quot;The Hatbox Baby&quot;, Ms. Brown's ethereal writing style and her very human characters will haunt you long after you're done reading.	2001-02-06

Rathbone's rendition of &quot;The Raven&quot; is especially noteworthy.  As the poem builds to its startling climax, the actor perhaps best known as one of the first to portray Sherlock Holmes onscreen proves he can do more than enact the role of the great detective.  His precise enuciation coupled with his abject terror at the sight of the raven sitting atop the &quot;pallid bust of Pallas&quot; will chill and thrill the listener.  His readings of &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot; and &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot; are also very enjoyable (listen for the drunken voice of Fortunato in the latter, which is sure to bring a smile).  <br />Price's readings, too, are a delight, as he brings to life &quot;The Gold Bug&quot; and - to me, the best selection - the tragic tale of &quot;Ligeia&quot;.  He has a way of making Poe's stories so personal that one can almost believe he is telling you about something which really did happen to him.  Price becomes Poe's narrator so easily, so smoothly, that he gains the listener's sympathy instantly as he spins his terrifying tales.<br />One reviewer commented that the lack of background sound effects and music detracted from the collection.  I beg to differ.  Who needs distractions from these two sonorious voices as they wrap around you on a dark, chilly, rainy evening?  If they were reading to you in front of the fire, there would be no background noises to distract your attention, and thus it is here.  You get pure story-telling magic from two of the most acclaimed actors of the 20th century.  The collection's audio quality is first-rate.  No scratches, skips or other sounds to mar the excellent recording quality.<br />I purchased these CS for long trips in my car and they've kept me good company for just that purpose.  For fans of Poe, these readings will renew awareness of the author's literary genius.  For those unfamiliar with his work, no two actors could provide better introductions to the original master of horror.	2001-02-04

I am progressing backwards through Carrie Brown's three novels, starting in December with &quot;The Hatbox Baby&quot;, her third and most recent effort.  I have just now completed her second offering, &quot;Lamb In Love&quot;.<br />Brown tells of postmaster Norris Lamb's quiet passion for Vida Stephen, a woman he's known since childhood and for whom, in his late 50s, he has discovered a deep love.  Vida, employed for years first as a nanny then as a companion to Manford, the idiot savant son of a wealthy widower who is always traveling on business, has never been married either.  But Vida loves Manford as deeply as if he were her own, and her complete devotion to him (at what might appear to be the sacrifice her own possible domestic life) is but one element attracting poor Norris to her.<br />Norris embarks on what he thinks is a very romantic - but secret - plan to court Vida without revealing his identity.  He mails her anonymous love letters through friends in the postal trade, so Vida begins receiving love letters from such exotic places as Cairo and Greece.<br />She is enchanted and puzzled, just as Norris wishes her to be.  She can't figure out who is behind these very romantic, tender missives.  She guesses several men in Hursley, the little English village where they live, but eventually rejects them.<br />Meanwhile, Norris gets quietly closer to Vida and Manford becomes his unwitting accomplice.  But as Norris comes to know Vida better, he also comes to know Manford.  Manford is no baby anymore and, though he cannot speak, he possesses a quiet intuitive intelligence and he senses the intangibles in life, like real love and kindness on the part of others.  It is ultimately through Manford that the two lovers are brought together in the most wonderful and touching of ways.  Manford also brings them around to themselves and, in so doing, their lives seem poised on the brink of fulfillment at last.<br />But Vida has an uncle in Corfu who invites her to come there and live with him.  Vida's never been out of Hursley in her entire life - it's the chance of a lifetime, and Norris knows that.  Will she go?  Has Norris lost his bid for love?  And what will happen to Manford?<br />In the summer of 1969, a time when men magically land on the moon, Norris and Vida discover that what they think they'll never have from life hovers ever so closely if they only believe in it.<br />Carrie Brown is so wonderful at those small, tender moments in life when time seems to stop or a momentous outcome rests on the most unlikely of people or events.  Her keen abilities at characterization clearly define Norris, Vida, Manford and the other minor characters with which they interact.  Her sense of place is quite sharp and it was no surprise to discover that Brown had lived in England for a time, as her descriptions of the weather, the gardens of the house in which Vida lives, and the insular qualitys of village life were described with quiet authority.<br />You, too, will be in love with &quot;Lamb In Love&quot;.

Patricia Cornwell provides a fascinating glimpse into the mind of her famous character, Dr. Kay Scarpetta, and, having considered &quot;Black Notice&quot; well below the author's incredible storytelling gifts, I am happy to say that she appears to be returning to form.<br />I will refrain from summarizing the plot, as that has already been done both in the editorial reviews and in the individual reviews which have preceeded mine.<br />I enjoyed Kay's interior musings here, which suggest a ripening character on the brink of great change, and also provide Scarpetta with a dimension of vulnerability which encourages greater identification with her on the part of the reader.  By the novel's end, Kay's future is uncertain and I hope that Cornwell seizes this opportunity to take her character somewhere she's never been before.<br />The danger of recycling the same characters throughout a series of novels is that they will become stale or, in the case of the last few Cornwell novels, bogged down in their own situations or miseries.  New characters add a breath of fresh air to the usual suspects (no pun intended) and often bring forth new dimensions of familiar characters.  Such is the case here with Anna Zenner, who is interesting in her own right and who provides Kay with something she hasn't really had in any of the previous novels:  a friend.  It would be good to see more of Anna - or others - in future works, so that Kay's world never again becomes as constricted as it was by the end of &quot;Black Notice&quot;.<br />Cornwell still has some work to do.  There are holes in her plot line.  For example, Chandonne's character unexplainedly drops off halfway through the story except when he's referred to by other characters, and the relationship between Jay Talley and Bev Kiffin seems a bit too coincidental - or perhaps this will be explained in the next book.  It makes no sense why these two should ever have hooked up and Cornwell offers no explanations.  She should exercise caution in taking a simplistic, obvious or predictable route out of a corner she may have written herself into just to provide her readers with a neat ending, which is what happened in &quot;Black Notice&quot;.  Complexity is fine as long as it is believable.<br />Taken as a whole, &quot;The Last Precinct&quot; is a highly encouraging sign that Cornwell is back and one hopes she will continue to improve Kay Scarpetta's path well into the future.rcise caution in taking a simplistic, obvious or predictable route out of a corner she may have written herself into just to provide her readers with a neat ending, which is what happened in &quot;Black Notice&quot;.

While we are all voyeurs to a certain extent, at the same time we are often keenly aware of how we appear to others and we gear our actions accordingly.  But how much actual control do we have over the view of our true selves?  And do we intentionally blur the line between the real and the staged in our daily activities?<br />Jefferson, the novel's protagonist and self-professed &quot;curator of the aesthetics of everyday life&quot;, isn't your ordinary Peeping Tom.  Each summer he rents out his apartment to an unsuspecting young lady, then heads to the building across the street and a boarded-up apartment.  Through a hole in one of the windows, Jefferson photographs his tenants, capturing their most private moments on film and calling his work a &quot;conceptual art project&quot;.  He wants to eradicate the boundaries between life and art but his actions are the only way he has of coping with a case of agoraphobia so severe he cannot even walk through Central Park.<br />His tenant this summer is Maya Vanasi, a Hindu woman possessing a bindi, or &quot;third eye&quot; - a red dot in the center of her forehead, which Maya tells Jefferson is a window to the soul.  For Jefferson, the bindi marks the beginning of an obsession and an eventual end to his summer occupation.<br />Taunt prose and a well-paced unraveling of a creepy yet fascinating story define this excellent novel which chronicles one man's insistent need to frame another's life, a need that ultimately leads him into a sea of questions concerning matters of faith, darkness and perception - both his and that of others.	2001-01-13

Kay Scarpetta spends her time contemplating the ugliness of humanity, surrounded by corpses which illustrate man's inhumanity to man.  The brilliant Adam Dalgliesh isn't exactly the life of the party, though he's an extremely sensitive soul who writes poetry - an intriguing character facet.<br />But Ian Rankin's Edinburgh police inspector John Rebus is a breed unto himself.  He loves the Rolling Stones and rock music in general.  He has terrible luck with women and drinks far too much for his own good.  He's stubborn, often rude and causes his superiors a great deal of worry.  How many of us can identify with us on one level or another?<br />Yet I'm always glad to see him in any new novel by Mr. Rankin and &quot;Set In Darkness&quot; does not disappoint.  Rankin's Rebus is one of the most memorable characters in 20th century crime fiction.  Though his is a morose personality, his dark sides never eclipse his basic humanity.  He makes mistakes and bad choices in his personal life, but when it comes to solving a crime he's dead on and often at odds with his long-suffering co-workers.<br />This time, Rebus must solve the mystery of the death of Roddy Grieve, an up-and-coming member of the Scottish Parliment who possesses a surname I found rather interesting, given his tragic fate.

Miranda gets surprised by the unexpected arrival of an old flame, Tracy Raz, and Harry's ex, Fair Haristeen, is also pitching woo, trying desperately to win Harry back.<br />The town's animal residents are busy, too.  Gray cat Pewter (formerly of Market Shiftlett's store) now lives with Harry.  Harry's grey tiger cat, Mrs. Murphy, is getting razzed by the smart-aleck mice in Harry's barn, who sing &quot;The Old Grey Mare&quot; whenever Mrs. Murphy comes around.  Tee Tucker, the intrepid Corgi, is still guarding the mailbags in Crozet's tiny post office and serving as confidant and ego-check for Mrs. Murphy.<br />But alas, all is not well.  Harry's high school classmates all begin receiving post cards in the mail saying, &quot;You'll never grow old&quot;.  But the complimentary mailings are soon accompanied by murder most foul.  And it's up to Harry's animal &quot;kids&quot; to get to the bottom of things ... before their mother winds up dead herself.<br />I just adore this series.  Recycling characters is one thing.  Getting them to grow and develop, while retaining the reader's interest and the characters' integrity, is quite another and Ms. Brown and Sneaky-Pie do it beautifully with each new installment of the Mrs. Murphy series.  The dialogue - especially that of the animals - is well-written and there are enough red herrings throughout the novel to confuse the situation and leave you guessing until the very end.<br />An 8th installment, &quot;Claws and Effect&quot;, is due out in February 2001 and I will be on the front step with my hand out for my copy.  I can't wait for another visit to Crozet and another murderous puzzle solved by Harry, Pewter, Tucker and - of course - Mrs. Murphy herself.	2000-12-27

Short story author Jane McCafferty examines these issues and secret sorrows in her first novel with a voice of quiet compassion and great sensitivity.<br />Ivy and Gladys are divorced, middle-aged sisters, reluctant roommates who are both employed as cooks at a camp and school in upstate New York.  Their closeness is in reality a brittle study in undisturbed living - neither wants the darker places between them stirred up.  Questions go unanswered, buried beneath the weight of the past and the fragility of the present.<br />Of course, over the course of the novel these places ARE exposed to the light of truth and the illumination of love and the journey is gentle and wrenching.  McCafferty's prose is economical and vivid and she handles alternating narrators and flashbacks smoothly and gracefully, without calling attention to the craft itself.<br />There is no gratuitous violence here, no boiling sex scenes with more body parts than a morgue.  &quot;One Heart&quot; is a tender portrait of the way life sometimes drives wedges between ourselves and others - and between ourselves and our own hearts.  As Ivy says, &quot;A certain kind of loss takes away your one heart and gives you another heart, a heart you hardly recognize.&quot;<br />And yet, readers of &quot;One Heart&quot; will both recognize and embrace the heart they find in this novel.	2000-12-27

I think most people - critics especially - see his novels as little more than popular &quot;fluff&quot; unworthy of serious consideration or discussion.  Perhaps  they think he &quot;cranks them out&quot; without any thought or consideration or craft.  Perhaps I, too, thought the same but I don't anymore and the reason is that in this book, Mr. King opens his mind up to the reader and shows him or her how writing - HIS writing specifically - gets done.  It's not magic; it doesn't happen when you sit around wishing it would happen or daydreaming about hitting the Best Seller list.  It's craft, pure and simple, - craft, hard work and &quot;doing the time&quot; behind the desk or the computer or the legal pad.<br />I think it's also good for the reader of Mr. King's memoir to know the author's forthright opinions.  He doesn't hold back on anything, from reading &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; by Strunk &amp; White (and what benefits one will gain from doing so) to saying bluntly, &quot;If you want to write, you do what you have to do to get the writing done.&quot;<br />Additionally, the book is an excellent (albeit short) autobiography of the writer himself.  It made me think back on my childhood days and wonder, &quot;What made me want to write or start to write those many years ago?&quot;<br />Highly recommended for writers and non-writers alike.	2000-12-26

Wonderful!  Why he doesn't do his own audio books - with his cultured yet mercurial British accent, clear tones, dramatic presentation and emotive voice - is beyond me.  After the reading, he was most gracious, signing books and chatting with all of us individually in an unhurried manner that suggested he enjoyed every minute of the event.<br />Now, to &quot;Martha Peake&quot;.  McGrath told us that this was his first attempt at an &quot;historical&quot; novel.  Being a Civil War buff myself, I found it refreshing that he set it during the American Revolution, a period about which I read shockingly little.  The first half of the novel takes place in England and McGrath told us that in order to capture the feeling of London's public houses and pubs, as well as the characters who inhabited them, he'd spent a great deal of time studying the novels of Charles Dickens and examining prints and artworks depicting the period.  His efforts were well-rewarded in scenes set in crowded pubs filled with people from all walks of life - from footpads to the aristocratic and sinister Lord Drogo.  You can smell the smoke from their pipes, taste the stale beer and ale and hear the customers' raucous laughter and the strident tones of the barmaids heaving libatious mugs onto long, wooden tables while getting pinched in the rear by way of reward.<br />Harry Peake, Martha's father and the focal point of the first half of the book, is so clear a character as to warrant his own novel.  One could well compare him in depth to the evil butler, Fledge, of McGrath's &quot;The Grotesque&quot; (later made into the movie &quot;Grave Indiscretion&quot; starring Sting and Alan Bates).  Fledge is pure evil.  Harry is not evil, but a victim - of himself.  McGrath shows Harry performing his dramatic poems in stinking, crowded London pubs, with his horrifically twisted spine unveiled and displayed for the audience to see.  His later disintegration and violence toward himself and his beloved daughter, Martha, inspire not disgust so much as sympathy.  Perhaps not &quot;sympathy&quot; for WHAT he does to Martha, but sympathy for WHO the man he has become by that time:  a gin-sodden tragedy only inches from oblivion and death, a fate which in Harry's condition could only be considered merciful.<br />Martha Peake herself illustrates how seldom we know the facts  behind all those popular legends which we accept as truth.  Her actions once she arrives in America are simplified by others for the cause of those who wish to keep the flame of the Revolution alive before the onslaught of the British Redcoats.  It has little to do with Martha's personal tragedy or the real truth behind her actions and prompts the question, &quot;If a 'distortion' of the truth (or, in some cases, an outright lie) brings about a positive end, is that distortion or lie justified?&quot;<br />The answer is yours to decide in Patrick McGrath's &quot;Martha Peake&quot;.

I saw this...[book]... and thought, &quot;OK ... let's see what an editor can tell me about writing.&quot;  Lord knows, at that moment, I was in serious need of solid, helpful but sympathetic advice.<br />There's this thing on my hard drive which I sometimes call a novel - to amuse either myself, my husband or any one of my three cats or half-dozen close friends.  It simmers in my Word Perfect 9 files like a pot of hot soup and I love it one day, then despair of its existence the next.<br />This day in B&amp;N, the day I discovered Ms. Lerner's book, I was in &quot;despair&quot; mode.  &quot;I can write/I can't write/I'm an ok writer/I couldn't write the ingredient list for the label on a can of dog food.&quot;  It was that kind of day.<br />But when I opened Ms. Lerner's book and saw the title of the first chapter, &quot;The Ambivalent Writer&quot;, I knew I'd come home.<br />This woman had written about me.  And while the portrait wasn't pretty, it WAS accurate - down to the ground.  So she immediately gained my trust as both reader AND writer for her honest evaluation - though I'm sure she didn't know that she was describing me specifically at the time.<br />Ms. Lerner's honest tone continued through the entire book, laying down the good, the bad and the outright ugly on types of writers and the publishing biz, as well as the process aspiring writers must face in seeking an agent, learning what an editor wants and what getting that publishing contract REALLY means.<br />Anyone who considers themselves keen on writing should read this book and trust its author. She's been there, she knows whereof she speaks and she's not afraid to give it to you like it is. If you can take it like that, you'll love &quot;The Forest For The Trees&quot; - and most likely get some first-class answers to your questions in the bargain.	2000-12-15

Such is the case with Carrie Brown's &quot;The Hatbox Baby&quot; - the title of which alone was enough to intrigue me.  And I must say that the book lives up to - and, indeed, beyond - its innovative title.<br />The novel tells the story of a baby which is brought to Dr. Leo Hoffman's premature baby exhibit at the 1933 Chicago World's Fair.  The baby's frantic father has brought him to Dr. Hoffman - considered to be a world-renown specialist in what are today called &quot;premies&quot; - on the advice of the midwife who helped deliver the baby.  &quot;If anyone can help your baby, HE can,&quot; she tells the baby's father.<br />As the father first hunts frantically for the exhibit and then, once he's found it, loiters hesitantly outside the doctor's tent, Ms. Brown demonstrates her ability to build and maintain suspense while evoking the dream-like unreality of the fair atmosphere, with its carnival trappings, misshapen participants and crowds eager for titillation and entertainment.<br />Careful and thorough characterizations leave the reader with clear pictures of Dr. Hoffman, Caroline the Fan Dancer (whose risque exhibition/dance show is located next door to the baby exhibit) and St. Louis, the pseudo-dwarf who is both friend and adopted family to Caroline, among others.  Ms. Brown knows how to elicit the reader's sympathy for and understanding of the people that populate this novel and this connection is established through her fine writing and ability to place the reader within the minds and worlds of her characters.<br />And, over all, looms the World's Fair - entertaining, nightmarish, ridiculous, pathetic, but always present and always clearly delineated.  This backdrop, with its focus on the future and its marvels to come, still never manages to escape the fact that some things - both good and bad - are eternal and ageless.<br />Of course, there is The Hatbox Baby itself and the questions it and its fellow exhibits raise, including asking the reader to consider just what is &quot;normal&quot; anyway.  This novel is a brilliant and unforgettable work, and I recommend having time at your disposal once you begin reading it because you will not want to put it down.and bad - are eternal and ageless.<br />Of course, there is The Hatbox Baby itself and the questions it and its fellow exhibits raise, including asking the reader to consider just what is &quot;normal&quot; anyway.

While the novel's premise - &quot;information is not knowledge&quot; - is indeed timely and intriguing, that's about as interesting as it gets.  A good writer SHOWS his readers what's going on - he doesn't TELL them what's going on.  In this novel, Mr. Carr tells us virtually everything through Gideon, the narrator, not allowing us to see for ourselves the events and motivations of the characters.<br />And what characters!  They are merely a group of (barely) 2-dimensional individuals about whom it is impossible to cheer or care.  They're skeletons, bare manifestations of Carr's ability to characterize, which I know he can do from reading &quot;The Alienist&quot; and &quot;Angel of Darkness&quot;.  (One note:  I was especially disappointed in the Barbarella-like sex kitten character, Larissa.  C'mon, Mr. Carr - are women in sci-fi novels doomed to perpetual portrayal as laser-blaster-toting sex bombs who can seduce a man and pilot the Millinium Falcon at lightspeed at the same time?)<br />Let's hope Mr. Carr's next novel returns to him to his strength - PAST history - and that from here on out, he lets the future take care of itself.	2000-12-05

Barbara Leaming has written on the lives of some of the most luminous Hollywood personalities there are, including Orson Welles and Rita Heyworth.  Her biography of Katharine Hepburn once again shows her ability to reveal the motivations and drives behind her subject while remaining a sympathetic observer.  She treats Hepburn's childhood, her adult years and her involvements with famous, powerful men (John Ford and Spencer Tracy, to name two of the better-known lovers), that independent spirit, and her quixotic but huge theatrical and film talent and the very unordinary family life she enjoyed while growing up fairly and with great detail.  Leaming gives us a portrait of a complex and brilliant artist of stage and screen who is larger than life, yet down to it as well, a glamourous Yankee with sensibility, common sense and charm to match.  Very readable and very entertaining, Leaming's biography of Ms. Hepburn ranks against that of writer Anne Edwards - all fans of Ms. K. would do well to turn its pages.	2000-11-25

Mattie's tragic, untimely death prompts her daughter, Ruth, to claim that she drowned too.  Her Aunt Amanda Starkey, Mattie's sister, denies Ruth's memories, but there was more to that icy winter night than a simple drowning.<br /> The many secrets held by this small but afflicted family gradually emerge in tense novel set during the winter of 1919, following World War I.  With Mattie dead, Amanda possessively looks after her small niece, Ruth.  Ruth's father, Carl, a man whom Amanda regards as weak and essentially useless, returns home from the war to find his wife dead and his household presided over by his edgy, secretive and autocratic sister-in-law.<br /> Carl finds Amanda's assumption of the responsibilities of both the farm and his daughter unnerving - almost frightening - in its intensity.  Meanwhile, the memory of his wife dims while his suspicions concerning the true circumstances of her death enlarge.  Ruth, meanwhile, grows up under her shadowy memories of her mother's death and the events of that fateful, long-ago evening.  Under the obsessive watch of her aunt, Ruth gradually begins to try to come to terms with her strange childhood, an attempt that will ultimately reveal all their secrets - particularly Amanda's.<br /> First-time novelist Christina Schwarz guides the reader through the bleakness of the old virtues of silence and stoicism, maintaining a razor-thin line of tension between all the characters at every turn.  Her setting is a long-forgotten world where a decent young woman could ruin herself by association with the wrong kind of man and, while the use of various narrators is a bit off-putting, that is no reason to pass this novel by.  Schwarz redeems what could be called a predictable plot by approaching events without excess melodrama, telling her story straight-on and showing the damage humans can cause when trying to protect both themselves and the ones they love.vents without excess melodrama, telling her story straight-on and showing the damage humans can cause when trying to protect both themselves and the ones they love.	2000-11-17

Grant, the only man since George Washington to hold the title of Lieutenant General, was certainly no success story when he entered the Civil War.  Yet he emerged from that conflict heralded and completely mystifying.  Both his contemporaries and future historians have cast him at various times as a hero, a man &quot;uniquely stupid&quot;, a drunk and a bloody butcher, indifferent to the numbers of men sacrificed in order to win the war.  Even long-time comrade General William T. Sherman observed, &quot;Yet to me he is a mystery, and I believe he is a mystery to himself.&quot;<br /> In fact, Grant had such hard luck before the war, that one could easily claim that the defining aspect of Grant's character was adversity.  In Ulysses S. Grant:  Triumph Over Adversity, 1822-1865 (the first of a two-volume biography), author and Civil War historian Brooks D. Simpson provides a closer look at the struggles through which one man emerged triumphant in spite of himself.  What results is a balanced portrait of an essentially moral, modest man who shunned fancy military maneuvers for common-sense action, skillfully balancing bickering generals and multiple politicians while bringing the Civil War, at long last, to a successful conclusion.<br /> Grant's personal life and the difficulties he faced played a major role in the man he eventually became.  But unlike Pulitzer Prize-winning Grant biographer William McFeely, Simpson does not shun these influences on the General's makeup.  The many conflicting personalities within Grant's life (a slave-holding father-in-law, a father who never shunned an attempt to cash in on his son's military successes, and a strong-willed wife) were the proving grounds where Grant honed his skill at handling the various military and political personalities during the war.<br /> Born on April 27, 1822, Hiram Ulysses Grant's boyhood was distinguished only by an extraordinary skill with horses.  At age seventeen, he entered West Point, where a fateful error in his registration changed his name to Ulysses S. Grant.  (During the war, those initials came to stand for &quot;Unconditional Surrender&quot; Grant.)  His unremarkable West Point career preceded a stint in the Mexican War, after which Grant wedded Julia Dent in 1848, following a bumpy courtship.<br /> Thinking Julia would be unhappy as the bride of a professional army man, Grant resigned from the only occupation which had thus far engaged his interest, making the ill-starred choice to experiment in the business world.  Various entrepreneurial attempts, including peddling wood on street corners and an attempt at farming, all met with disaster.  At his lowest point, Grant found himself serving as a lowly clerk in his father's general store.<br /> All his life, Grant had sought to prove himself - either to himself or someone else - but then along came the Civil War, bringing redemption for Grant as it did for other men who appeared ill-suited for ordinary life.  Grant reenlisted and his life changed forever.<br /> Though obviously partial to his subject, Simpson also notes Grant's tactical errors with unflinching honesty.  But he does so in a balanced, well-researched effort that is more than a &quot;warts and all&quot; picture.  From the bloody fields of Shiloh to the stubborn siege of Vicksburg, Simpson examines not only Grant's actions but those of the other players on the stage.  Grant prosecuted the war while facing jealous superiors, wily politicians and resentful generals, all of whom thought they could do a better job than their commander.<br /> Was Grant a hero?  Most certainly.  When other Union generals refused to move, Grant stubbornly pushed forward.  Did he drink?  Yes.  However, the alleged degree of his drinking was often exaggerated by men who suffered from rampant ambition and an eagerness to pass on falsehoods or rumors to Grant's superiors in order to further their own careers.  Was he a butcher?  No - not when viewedthrough the lens of military necessity.  Grant, sensible about war, knew that war meant killing and dying - but he was not immune to the suffering around him.  Indeed, he knew that swift prosecution of the war meant, in the long run, lives saved, but the sufferings of his troops never failed to upset or move him.<br /> In his preface to Grant's memoirs, Simpson notes that when Grant was asked to write his memoirs to the monthly magazine Century, he inquired of the publication's editor, Robert U. Johnson, &quot;Do you really think any one would be interested in a book by me?&quot;  Clearly the General had no idea of the fascination with which he was regarded, both by those of his time and of times to come.  The upcoming second volume of the series, entitled Ulysses S. Grant: The Fruits of Victory, 1865-1885 will examine Grant's post-war life and his Presidency and complete one man's illuminating portrait of a figure who continues to inspire devotion and debate.viewed through the lens of military necessity.

I have the good fortune of knowing Mr. Haymes, who possesses an easy writing style that often sparkles with a subtle wit.  I have read several articles of his, only to end up chuckling - if not outright guffawing - at his prose.  Now he's taken the leap of which many of us scribblers only dream:  he's actually published something.  And I'm happy to say that his first novel, &quot;Desperate Summer&quot;, only took me one day to read but not because I wanted to get it over with.  Rather, I was held by its plot, intrigued by his characterizations and thought that he handled his female protagonist with delicacy and precision.<br />Yes, the novel is short but one doesn't have to overburden points and descriptions when one trusts the reader.  Reading - or, indeed, any effort into the visual or literary arts - is a two-way street, or should be.  Think of Alfred Hitchcock:  does The Master show us rivers of blood and gore in his films?  No.  In not spoon-feeding his audience, Hitch proved that what isn't shown or said is many times more horrifying or stimulating than what is.  When the waters of a plot are unmuddied by excessive detail or laborious descriptions, the artist allows the audience to bring their own imagination along for the ride, making the film or book a truly memorable experience.  Mr. Haymes' tight prose tells you just what you need to know and leaves you to fill in the rest as you will.<br />&quot;Desperate Summer&quot; is a strong first effort,  and I'm happily anticipating his next novel, which I understand is being created even as I type.

I won't  reiterate the plot, as this Amazon.com page will detail all one needs to  know very well without my help.  However, I will say that - once again -  I'm having difficult tearing myself away from the book.  I want to take  this work slowly yet, as is always the case with Ms. Howatch, I find I  can't stop once I start a chapter or a section.  I'm happy to report the  re-appearance (still in vital and believable form) of Nicholas Darrow,  Lewis Hall and Alice Fletcher from the latter volumes of the Starbridge  series.  Seeing them again felt like a reunion with old friends.  They may  be familiar characters but they are as fresh as newcomers Carter Graham,  her mysterious husband, Kim, and the intriguing and ever-so-sexy Eric  Tucker.  Being a writer myself, I know how difficult it is to create  characters - then recycle them - as believable entities.  With &quot;The  High Flyer&quot; - as with all of Ms. Howatch's novels - I just stand back  and admire and pray that someday my talents will equal one-tenth the  writing skills she displays, once again, so well in this novel.  Additionally, her Starbridge series and &quot;The High Flyer&quot; continue  to bring me a spiritual depth of story on a realistic, rational and  intellectual plane that I get nowhere else, either in novels or organised  religion or philosophical debate.  Her characters' lives are blown apart,  only to come together again through ministry, faith and a continuing belief  in the elasticity of the human spirit.  As with all her other works, this  one is one you shouldn't miss.  (My only regret is having to wait 3-4 years  between fixes!)	2000-07-11

Seldom have I felt such pity and admiration for a set of characters.  I regret finishing the book, yet this weekend I could not put it down.  Like the  recent film &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, Faulks' descriptions of WWI  trench warfare and the horrors thereof depict things that most people don't  consider or are not told about.  We get the pretty, heroic stories in  classroom history books but go lacking in the real, heart-rending facts of  warfare that make the freedoms these people died to protect that much more  precious.<br />The prose is achingly beautiful and haunting.  If you long to  get immersed - TOTALLY immersed - in a novel that will remain with you long  after you finish the last word of the last page, &quot;Birdsong&quot; is  highly recommended.  I find myself wanting to start it over again, more  slowly this time, and wrap myself in its sadness and lush storytelling once  more.	1999-03-20

Ocassionally I found Stella's narration traveling in the length of the  shortest of Charles Dickens' sentences but never mind that, if you keep  reading you find a warm novel, a sympathetic main character, plenty of  screwed-up supporting characters and a pleasing escape from reality.	1999-03-06
US	53059087	R8VIEER5PQCMB	0385493800	934400771	The Testament	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Back to basics	OK folks ... no one is going to accuse John Grisham of writing &quot;GREAT LITERATURE&quot;.  He himself describes it as &quot;entertainment&quot; in &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine this week.  However, his recent  &quot;entertainments&quot;, including and since &quot;The Runaway  Jury&quot;, have been a bit thin in this humble writer's opinion.  Until  now.<br />With &quot;The Testatment&quot;, Grisham has put together an  altogether different main character and actually seems to be saying  something within the dramatic episodes of Conrad-esque trips down Brazilian  rivers, bouts of strange, exotic diseases and a quest on the part of  protagonist Nate O'Riley to find a woman who doesn't want to be found.  What's more, she doesn't - gasp! - want the billions of dollars left to her  by her eccentric father Troy Phelan, a man whose personality and family,  while one-dimensional, still manage to come across strongly to the reader  as people you wouldn't want to know in real life.<br />While Nate makes his  outward journey through Brazil, and his inner journey through the various  faults and addictions he possesses, he is always a thoroughly believable  character, an honest one, a man slowly realizing the shallowness of the  things of this world.  The book's narrative and knowledge of Brazil are  first-rate and the pace is, as always, breakneck.  If I hadn't had to go  back to my damn job this afternoon, I'd have finished this book by 3 PM  today.  Read it expecting nothing but top-notch entertainment and a wild  ride ... plus a spiritual side that will surprise and, I think, please many  of Grisham's devoted fans.  I was quite pleased.	1999-02-20

When I  started &quot;Mornings On Horseback&quot;, I felt that I was armed with  more information about this President than I had going into  &quot;Rise&quot;; however, once I completed &quot;Mornings&quot;, I  realized that I was armed with an entirely different type of knowledge.  David McCullough gets us into the Roosevelt house and makes the people in  TR's life come alive.  &quot;Nurture&quot; is a vital componant of anyone's  development and in this book, one sees just how family shapes a great  personality such as his.  To truly understand TR from a historical  perspective one must examine his roots.  This book is a joy to read, very  informative and well-paced.	1998-09-02

You can't trust McGrath's narrators, who always pursue their own insidious agendas.  This fact is never more obvious than in &quot;Asylum&quot;.  The reader gets the story of Stella and her forbidden love affair with mental patient Edgar Stark only through the narrator, Peter's, eyes.  Never once do Stella or Edgar get a chance to tell their own story.  Peter - the psychiatrist, the professional, the &quot;old friend&quot; - is most poised to take unfair advantage of the story and the situation, knowing full well he of all people should not be &quot;healing&quot; Stella.  And he, of all people, should not be telling the reader this tragic tale, injecting into his words hidden jealousy and an emotional pathology that is fascinating and repelling once you realize what he is doing.  In the end, Stella trumps Peter but one is left wondering:  who here needs &quot;Asylum&quot;?  The patients?  Or the doctor ..	1997-08-15

Nowhere are these more evident than in the passages describing little Frankie McCourt having to hunt through all the pubs on his street to find his father, who is somewhere drinking away 5 pounds sent to the family in honor of a new baby.  The reader is impressed by the lack of bitterness in the grown Frank McCourt; he simply tells what happened with warmth and humor and compassion.<br /><br /> Whether the reader is laughing at the author's frank, hilarious descriptions of his own sexual awakening, or shaking his or her head over the passages describing the deaths of his two brothers and only sister, they will, as they close the book, wonder immediately when the sequel will be available.	1997-05-04

This family had four children:  Frank, Jr.; Gaylen; Gary; and Mikal, the youngest.  Gary became famous in 1977 when he challenged the federal and state capital punishment machinery and forced them to carry out the death sentence imposed upon him for the murders of two young Mormon men in Utah.  He wanted death by firing squad and would settle for nothing less.  Even the efforts of civil rights groups on his behalf impressed him not:  he wanted to die and he scornfully dismissed their legal maneuverings.  On January 17, 1977, Gary Gilmore got what he wanted:  he was executed by a Utah firing squad, thus ushering in America's active revival of the death penalty.<br /><br />Yet, Gary Gilmore was a person shaped by the events of his formative years and by the events which took place in his family.  The Gilmore family was not a fairy-tale family:  rather, it defined the word &quot;disfunctional&quot;.  The father, Frank, Sr., beat the mother, Bessie, in front of the children on more than one occasion.  He beat the boys, too, reserving the worst of the white-hot heat of his inner anger for Gary.  Gary's violent acts, and the fate he suffered, prove once more that it is the children who often pay for the sins of the parents.  In this case, a child paid the ultimate price.<br /><br /> Today, two of the brothers are living and two are dead (Gaylen died in 1971 from complications from a stabbing in Chicago).  In Shot In The Heart, Gary's brother, Mikal, a well-known writer for Rolling Stone magazine, breaks the silence and tells the story of the family's violent, abnormal history.  With brutal honesty and candid, painful insight, he speaks for both the living and the dead.<br /><br /> Psychologists say that people doing so-called &quot;grief work&quot; following the death of a loved one must &quot;tell the tale&quot; of the loved one's life over and over in order to come to terms with their loss and what that loss means for those left behind.  Mikal Gilmore neither condones the players in this tragic story, nor rationalizes the things they do to one another.  He simply tells the tales not only of Gary, but also Frank, Sr., Bessie and the other children, with dignity and compassion, while the sorrow and pain bleed through every word, every page.  One is tempted to think that the events related here are the product of some highly creative and immensely gifted writer and, in fact, they are: however, they are all true.  Aye, there's the rub.<br /><br /> If there is anything good to be produced from this horrific family tree, it is the author himself.  Despite his past, he emerged a survivor with a rare and shining talent - the ability to make you feel each word he writes, whether his subject is himself or another family member.  Shot In The Heart should be required reading and I dare anyone to put it down until the last ghostly memory has been read on the last page of the last chapter.<br /><br /> The text is augmented by family photographs and conversations with other players in the saga of Gary Gilmore, including his girlfriend, Nicole.  The most touching aspect, however, is the inclusion of some of Gary's own artwork, which often depicted children with huge, mournful eyes staring into space.  There is something missing about these children; it's as though they are searching for something they don't have.  Self-portraits?  Undoubtedly.Gilmore neither condones the players in this tragic story, nor rationalizes the things they do to one another.
