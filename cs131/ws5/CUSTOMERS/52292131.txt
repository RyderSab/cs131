However, he is one of the country's most renowned economists, for what that is worth. This \\"rogue\\" economist provides one of the most intriguing looks at the social issues confronting the nation. This book has no cohesion other than Levitt's politically incorrect takes on issues like crime, cheating and whether Moesha loses more money of the long term than Matthew.  <br /> <br />This book has received a lot of press for its original thought and character. While you will may be apt to cringe at some of Levitt's conclusion (though most are simple statistical correlations), you cannot deny Levitt's intellect and use of economic principles to, as he says, explain why things happen. So you don't agree with Levitt's take on abortion and the reduction in crime? I say at least he has the guts to look at the numbers and draw some comparisons. <br /> <br />Economics is a science just as biology. Sometimes people don't what to believe what the numbers are telling them. Levitt makes you believe. <br /> <br />While his several year old abortion and crime rate correlation got most of the press, Levitt's chapter on the complexities of a street drug ring shows his depth of insight and compassion.	2005-06-06

For interest and readability, this book is a much better piece of writing. <br /> <br />Gladwell tackles the issue of the elements that must be present for information to spread across cultures and societies. Taking his research from history, marketing, economics, psychology and sociology, Gladwell seeks to explain why certain products shine while other whither, how TV shows use research to hook its viewers in, and who are the most important people needed to spread messages. <br /> <br />What is the tipping point? The tipping point is the little edge it takes to get information over the top and rolling. What information do we as a society focus too much on and not focus enough on? Gladwell's research has implications for social policy, advertising and public service campaigns. His chapter on smoking and suicide rates should be faxed to every politician and parent trying to scare their kids into not smoking. <br /> <br />	2005-06-06

Any action or perceived \\"thriller\\" became engulfed in Grisham's Reader's Digest history of Italy. One might expect a typical page-turner from the king of legal thrillers, but from about 50 pages in to about 50 pages from the end, the book completely bogs down in English-Italian translation. <br /> <br />Joel Backman, a Washington, DC, power broker, gets a controversial presidential pardon after 6 years in the slammer for trying to hawk a satellite jamming software to the highest bidder. The CIA worked the pardon in order to see who might be interested in killing Backman, giving them a lead on who was trying to purchase the software. Much of the book takes place in Italy, where Backman was hiding and forced to learn the language and customs to blend in. <br /> <br />While some of the Italian history was interesting, the pages upon pages of language tutoring was simply too much and too boring for a typical Grisham work. <br /> <br />Backman could also be one of the more forgettable protagonists in Grisham's body of work. We'll see what Hollywood does with him.	2005-03-28

Paine was a simple workman-like fellow (and an Englishman) who changed the course of the world with a 46-page pamphlet written to the masses of the colonies in order to push the people away from reconciliation and towards independence from Britain. Like Paine, Liell's work is not scholarly, so it is an enjoyable read, and at less than 150 pages, easily digestable.<br />This piece is an excellent primer to the true beginnings of the independence movement. While history books provide a footnote to Paine at best, Liell gives Paine (and rightfully so) the bulk of the credit for having the guts and ability to produce a work of such heroic proportions that it became the rallying cry of the massess, which ultimiately forced the hand of the Congress and state legislatures to push towards independence.<br />Don't read this if you are looking for a dissection of Common Sense itself. What Liell provides is a simply history lesson behind its formulation and impact.	2004-01-04

Through all my years of schooling, I had never been introduced to Rand's work or perspective. I am so glad I stumbled across a reference in a book I was reading recently.<br />Rand's story of breaking the chains of socialism and collectivism struck the soul of my inner belief system. In the self or ego lies the soul of a human. The inner drives and wants make up the man. We all strive to find and perfect ourselves and find answers in this world. That is what makes us human. By being held back by a society's preconceived notions and goals, we are denied our rights as humans. This is the purpose of &quot;Anthem,&quot; which is thematic of the scores of times throughout history man has risen up to take on a powerful society.<br />Rand's style was smooth, concise and to the point. My favoriate line, one I read several times, was early in the work when Equality 7-2521 was struggling to find the answers of nature. Rand writes: &quot;The secrets of this earth are not for all men to see, but only for those who will seek them.&quot; <br />For too long, different civilizations have stiffled the creativity of all man, leaving the search for knowledge left to a chosen sect of society. &quot;There is noting to take a man's freedom away from him, save other men,&quot; Rand writes. &quot;To be free, a man must be free of his brothers. That is freedom. This and nothing else.&quot; By saying this, Rand does not dimiss the brotherhood of society. She simply says a man cannot be free unless he alone searches for his true nature, his EGO.<br />It is for this EGO to which we truly live.	2003-12-31

The system consists of simply a transfer of millions of dollars from big corporations to trial lawyers with the plaintiffs getting hosed two times over.<br />Grisham has made it a point in recent legal thrillers like The Runaway Jury and The Summons to foucs on greed and human nature, and he succeeds with this latest attempt.<br />It is my hope that Grisham's next legal thriller will get back to the page-turning drama of books like The Client and The Firm.	2003-12-28

Schools are like organisms, the teacher said, because you never can identify exactly how and what makes them go. For those who claim to carry the quick fixes to an education system said to have been broken off and on for the last 50 years, take that advice. <br />And just when you think you have all the answers, read Hume's book about Whitney High School.<br />Using a formula of high expectations, partental involvement and a selective admissions process, Whitney has built one of the jewels of the California educational system with about 95 percent of the students college bound and SAT scores to drool over.<br />But before principals nationwide begin to copy the forumla, Hume illustrates the neagative variables to such success. This school has been built on the backs of automatons who begin their quest for the HYP (Harvard, Yale, Princeton) track as early as third grade. Hume characterizes life at Whitney as a six-year experiment in nerves. Like the physics projects illustrated in the book, some students are one Alka-Seltzer short of an emotional explosion. AP classes and numerous extra-curriculars are means to the HYP end, not necessarily instrinsic desires to gain knowledge and life experience.<br />While Hume's portrayal represents a microcosm of Whitney, it reveals the predicament high-stakes plays in the educational accountability movement. Success is not in the subjective and personal nature of knowledge, but the impersonal (hence the faceless student on the cover of Hume's book and pictureless inside) ranking on standardized tests.<br />While Whitney may be at the top, others school continually try to knock it off, using the same twisted reason a Whitney junior spends $1,000 to increase his SAT score to 1560 then decides to retake it again -- \\"You can never have too high a score.\\"<br />I believe in high expectations and no excuses for schools and students, but I am wary of a federal system trying to devise a formula to improve the education of tens of millions of children controlled by tens of millions of variables. When you try to control the beast, the beast ultimately ends of controlling you. Whitney students are perfect examples.<br />However, if Hume's book shows anything, it is that not just parental involvement is key to educational success, but local (not state or federal) control is vital to the success of any school. For whatever negative side effects, Whitney's formula works well for them. It is up to other schools to create their own.	2003-12-26

Good but not great, Delillo juxtaposes college football with nuclear warfare in what was meant as a satirical look at American life in the 1950s. It came off as a confusing, contrived mesh between the two.<br />Where Delillo does score well is on the dialogue. The comical conversations by teammates on the bench during pivitol action seem so real. And Delillo's terminology and feel for the game is stunningly accurate.<br />I found book too heady to comprehend. But in layman's terms I believe Delillo was simply trying to say that war is too grave to be compared to a game taken vastly too serious by a gladiator culture.<br />However, I felt Delillo was also trying to make the point that war and football are practiced by at times neurotic and destructive individuals.	2003-01-19

Thomas writes from the true perspective of a teenager in search of a meaning in his life when things seem hopeless and lost. Steve York displays all the characteristics of a high schooler looking for his identity. Although he protrays himself as a cynic and misfit, York represents all teenagers who simply seek acceptance and a place to fit in. York experiences the highs and lows, including his first love and the battle of appeasing a disappointed father.<br />Through writing, York finds that meaning and is able to mend fences and realize that only you can truly choose the right path for yourself. Steve eventually does that, makes up with his father and uses his intellect for construction and not destruction.<br />This is a solid YA novel that many teenagers should be able to associate with.	2002-06-26

But when Bernhardt gets on the course to write about Cross's tournament, he gets nutty.<br />Bernhardt says in his acknowledgments that some of the yardage figures are incorrect. Why does he need to do that? There are many examples of unrealistic and flat out wrong information. For example, Cross wants to hit a driver off a tee but his caddie Fritz says to layup with a 7-iron. On a 450-yard hole? I doubt that. Hasn't Bernhardt heard of electronic scoring? Golfers no longer have to wait in the bar to see the scores posted. This isn't the Delco Thursday night league. There is real-time scoring all over the course and has been for a long time. Also, Cross was in fourth place heading into the final round, yet when he finishes, Bernhardt writes he must wait on 14 other golfers to finish. That's absurd, considering leaders are paired off last. In almost ho-hum delivery, Bernhardt writes that Cross eagles the 18th in the final round. That means he holed out from probably 165 yards, which would be a heck of a feat.<br />This goes beyond creative license and creeps into the realm of pure laziness. The author does mix in accurate history here and there, but his grasp of Augusta National lacks perspective.	2002-04-09

In Klein's view, Clinton was a victim of the good times, when the public usually ignores the political scene, a victim of divisive politics (which of course he was more than a willing accomplice) and of course, a victim of the blue dress he joyfully stained.<br />These shameful excuses cloak what, for the most part, was a sensible dissection of the Clinton presidency, which started with so much promise to only disintegrate into disorganization and obsession.<br />Clinton came to office talking a good game with his refreshing Third Way governing style. His ideals of government centered on a citizenry grasping opportunity to learn responsibility in order to form a solid community. Good stuff. But as Clinton moved back to the left after the campaign, the Old Democrat took over.<br />Clinton's foreign policy was a joke, no doubt about it, but Klein rightfully gives Clinton credit for his working class tax-credit system which limited the growth of government bureaucracy and was essentially a form of tax cut. Clinton also showed prudence by not [messing] up the technological boom with unnecessary government intervention.<br />Klein should be ashamed for complaining about how Clinton never got the chance to lead like George W. Bush has done so well after Sept. 11. Who would wish that on any president in any country?<br />The plain truth is that Clinton had many chances to lead, and he blew them. The bombing of the USS Cole, in particular, should have been the ultimate wakeup call, but there was no urgency. Had he listened to his supposed instincts and not his pollsters, maybe he would have been the icon he is still wrongfully lauded to be.	2002-03-28

As Auchinocloss points out, had TR had a moment like his nephew-in-law FDR, his true genesis would have shone much brighter, although he did bring us the Panama Canal, trustbusting and a conservation record that is to be proud of. His ruggedness is often overshadowed by his intellect, which is on display in this book by the many quotations before, during and after his presidency.<br />A part of the American Presidents series edited by Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., &quot;TR&quot; provides a solid foundation for further study of a great and no nonsense American.	2002-03-02

An admitted socialist, Laxer's travels in America for this book carried a specific agenda, which makes his thesis of being a modern De Tocqueville fall short. While he wrote about his disconnected travels from a series of years in this country, his writing was very cohesively wrapped around one simple theme: the U.S. is turning into a glutton wasteland of obesity, greed and delusion. That and the right wing is to blame for everything.<br />I give this book such a high review because Laxer does a superb job shining the light on the inconsistencies in America's history compared to its ideals of freedom. Being the lone &quot;superpower&quot; in the world, Americans have grown accustomed to outsiders attacking our way of life. I found Laxer's assessment on most social issues, including the rampant obesity and the lust for money, to be on target.<br />Had Laxer not had an agenda, he would have talked to a few people like me, whose goals are simply to find meaningful work, raise a family and live in quiet solitude. Money is large amounts does not appeal to me. Stuff, I can do without. America is still made up of millions like me, and they are of every color and religion.<br />I am with Laxer on the inability of many in this country to see this growing American empire. And I believe Laxer would cringe to know that people even as right as Pat Buchanan agree the rampant U.S. involvement militarily all over the world needs to re-thought. I'm sure the two would disagree on the solutions.<br />All in all, Laxer makes some direct hits, but I still believe I would want to live nowhere else.	2002-02-27

I explained the book, and she said who was on the cover. I said it was a picture of Francis Scott Key. She said, &quot;Oh, the man they named the Florida Keys after.&quot;<br />For those Americans who don't know their history, particularly the often untold truths of the War of 1812 and the contentiousness over our national anthem, this book is a perfect place to start. It's short, informational and at times very humorous. Molotsky brings the reader history and current debate on topics such as flag burning and how to preserve that wonderful flag that flew over Fort McHenry.<br />I learned some new things in this book, and if the response from the waitress is any indication, this country is in need of a few more history lessons. This a short read but the value cannot be underscored.	2002-02-25

There are few courtroom scenes, but many lawyers. Rather Grisham's latest tackles human character. What would you do if you came home, found your father dead and $3 million sitting in the corner? That's the plot that entraps protagonist Ray Atlee.<br />Greed and how a human handles the opportunity for sudden wealth has been a staple in some of Grisham's works (ie, Runaway Jury). While there is no big court case here, Grisham puts Ray and his brother Forrest on trial in real life. It produces a not so shocking but interesting ending.<br />This is hardly a tour de force. It is not as thick as other Grisham thrillers, and because of that, The Summons lacks character and plot depth.<br />However, it still has that Grisham stamp. Fans will be satisfied.	2002-02-13

He whines about how things aren't what they used to be. He shovels dirt on the works of the &quot;big book&quot; writers like Clancy, King and Grisham. And throws in just enough French phrases to earn admission to any cocktail party he wants.<br />All this book is, in sum, is this: Korda lists books in paragrah form then does it again in list form.<br />This is meant as a cultural history of what books Americans bought throughout the century, but it really is a brief history.<BR>These pages would have been better served had he spent more time analyzing why we read what we read. Rather, he says in effect, &quot;We are in World War II, so there are a lot of war books on the market.&quot;<br />And the 1980s was filled with &quot;get-rich-quick books&quot; that Korda said were popular among top executives but did nothing for &quot;underlings&quot; to rise to the top. Wouldn't he surmise that because these books were in fact bestsellers (read by millions of people), that maybe some &quot;underling&quot; read one and made it big. Of course not because Korda whole-heartedly admitted early on that editors and writers are liberally biased.<br />In reality, Korda spent 200 pages waiting to throw in the comment that, &quot;In 1981, I was the editor of four of the year's bestsellers (not a record -- I believe the record is seven, which I think I hold -- but still not bad).&quot; If Korda is such a reknowned editor, why is he using phrases like, &quot;I think,&quot; which he does more than once. Why not check it out?<br />Overall, I enjoyed looking over the lists but grew tired of Korda's commentary on how no real literature is out there. Although the structure of the book business has changed, the same market principles are still place: If you have a product people want, it will sell.	2002-02-09

This comes 175 pages into an analysis that carries mostly a political slant on the outcomes.<br />I commend Greene for being one of the first to write a highly-readable legal account of the 2000 election, unlike others written in bland legalese. This book can be understood by all non-lawyers, but it doesn't mean that it has been dumbed down.<br />The author winds through the legal wranglings with ease but often cheerleads for the left and Al Gore, always calling Bush's legal arguments &quot;weak&quot; and going to great lengths to come to Gore's defense.<br />His Monday morning quarterbacking is typical. His blasting of the U.S. Supreme Court is transparent. His defense of the butterfly ballot lawsuits is comical.<br />I don't have a problem with his partisanship. Greene's is the least rhetorical in the volumes out about the 2000 election. But clearly, the embers haven't cooled enough to provide a truly non-partisan view of the outcomes -- if there is such a thing.	2002-02-07

When I first picked up the Fox News Channel in 1998, I began watching his show and always thought this lion would never leap into the cage of the \\"mainstream\\" media. He was too gruff, and FNC was too tainted by Rupert Murdoch's name.<br />He has been a rousing success, however, and whether O'Reilly likes it or not he is now one of those elite he despises, but he is also the drum beat of common sense and middle America.<br />OK, all together now. Bill O'Reilly is egotistical, boorish and bombastic. But don't call him a journalist and don't compare him to Larry King. King's ratings aren't in his league anymore.<br />As he said in this latest tome, O'Reilly is like the editor of the editorial pages. He is a columnist not a news reader, and his interviews uncover truth while King markets tears and emotion.<br />O'Reilly got a bit lazy with this endeavor. He wrote less than 100 pages while the rest are filled with transcripts from interviews he conducted over the past few years. For loyal viewers, it's a rehash, but some memorable moments are worth rereading, particularly when Dan Rather showed his true apologist colors for the establishment. The Jesse Jackson race baiting scandals are always worth reviewing. <br />Either close to deadline or needing an easy way out, Chapter 16 on the personal spin zone was pulled from his first book, \\"The O'Reilly Factor\\", so skip it and move straight to James Ellroy's witty afterword on the necessity of living a no spin life. <br />Your sanity will be thanks enough.	2002-01-08

The stroy begins with former commandos killing three politicians that are corrupt, which is quite an interesting concept. The SEALS feel they have ruined America and deserved to be taken out -- literally. It all provides the ironic backdrop for the climax as other shady characters try to take advantage of these deaths.<br />Flynn writes with as much knowledge and as much exlosiveness as David Baldacci and Brad Meltzer, but I did feel he gave away the ending well in advance. His characters, particularly the political figures, were so real and portrayed so accurately that parts were almost laugh out loud funny. Gee, I wonder who the drunk, gray-haired senator that gets whacked might have been?<br />With other bestsellers already on the shelves it is clear Flynn will be a force in this area for a long time.

Therapist Tomy Seymour, who testified at Miller's trial, saves Miller from drowning in the opening scenes and spends the rest of the novel figuring out what exactly happened so many years ago.<br />Barker paints a stunning portrait inside the mind of a child murderer, who manipulates every person who tries to help him, especially Seymour. The shirnk re-interviews those close to Miller immediately after he is sent to prison, and the tension builds in a series of therapy sessions he has with Miller.<br />While the climax and the ending were deflating and seem to make the whole exercise a sham and setup by Miller, Barker's writing carries the day and makes this a sensational read.	2001-12-14

I do not dispute that Mike Royko was one of the greatest columnist of this century. I was in one of those god-forsaken journalism schools Royko despised when he passed away, and I was truly saddened his column would never appear again.<br />But I would have to wonder how Royko might respond to Ciccone's tribute, which is what this book was more than a biography. Like another reviewer, I was taken back by all the editing errors, particularly the many left out words. I believe Royko, a stickler for the small details, would have ranted.<br />This is a tribute more than a biography because the author isn't the least bit objective. I don't know how many times he lauds Royko for being the greatest and for his longevity (33 years and more than 8,000 columns). <br />Yet for all the slobbering, Ciccone paints an honest portrait of a gruff, hard drinking and harder working ethnic who made a mark despite a tough beginning.<br />I enjoyed Royko's story not because I am a journalist but becasue I am an American and nostalgic for stories that exemplify the American boots-straps mentality. But more than that, Royko became so popular because he was so human. He had his share of triumphs along with his share of problems, most notably drinking. He was the conscience of a city when it did not want to recognize its racist problems, and he eventually became the nation's straight-talking uncle who told it like it was.<br />Royko is a clearly a love-him-or-hate-him figure and so is this book. If you were a fan, it gives you an insight behind the byline. If not, it gives you more ammunition.<br />Something tells me Royko would feel both ways.	2001-12-11

He has done in book form what Chevy Chase and Christmas Vacation did on screen. Both provide a hilarlious take on the Christmas season.<br />In this slim volume, Grisham has continued his detour from legal thrillers to capture meaning in his subject in much the same way he did in A Painted House.<br />While the concept of Americans over doing it around Christmas is cliched, Grisham's tale is still a fine original.	2001-11-29

But in the midst of a thought-provoking tale, he defaces any and all societal institutions, including a tabloid media, religion, government, the justice system and corporate America, which leaves the reader with a sour taste.<br />With so many integral parts to the puzzle, the message is so muddled and gets lost in a maze that eventually reaches a lousy ending in the final two pages.<br />While Terry Mathers, Akst's complex and pot-smoking protagonist, eventually reaches an obvious epiphany, the fate Akst's creates for him is so far from what anyone might expect, particulary his final career and relationship destinations. Mathers, like his father and his wife, end the novel with no redeeming qualities.<br />But that is Akst's ultimate goal and message. In a complex and inter-connected world, nothing and no one are as innocent as they appear.	2001-11-28

The football aspects are obvious, and Jenkins plays them well. The sport is truly the one game many in the nation are passionate about, particularly in a rural Southern town.<br />But this book has so much more inside it. Although there are many storylines, they all revolve around the enduring feeling of hope. Because it's a Jenkins' novel, God becomes the center of everyone's hope. Even for those who aren't deep-seated in their faith (and even get annoyed when characters like Rachel harp and harp until you see it her way), Jenkins delivers a message that even beyond spirtualness one can have an impact through selflessness and giving. The most poignant moment of all in this regard comes when Calvin finally gets it and realizes his love with Bev.<br />Behind the religious message and faith in God, Jenkins has produced a practical book that underscores so much of what Americans are all about: compassionate and caring. I think we have all seen that in the wake of Sept. 11.	2001-11-15

While used to reading mostly history and adult fiction, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the story.<br />Although I am not head-over-heels pumped to read the next volumes, I see how kids and adults alike can lose themselves in this fantasy, far-fecthed as it may be.<br />I disagree with those who discount Potter on religious reasons because it supposedly sensationalizes occultism.

This book mixes enough politics, gambling, golf and sex to become one of the funniest books out there.<br />Jenkins' style is love-him-or-hate-him, but you if like this one, you'll be searching more used bookstores for other books that are out-of-print.	2001-10-30

Jimmy Carter captures a life that, if dates were not ascribed, one might think it took place in an earlier century.<br />While I knew the Great Depression was severe and all encompassing, it never registered to me that sharecropping, a truly disheartening endeavor, prdocued less than a hundred dollars a year for an entire family. Although fortunate to grow up on a well-to-do farm, Carter's rise to high office is even more remarkable given his rural roots.<br />Whatever you thought of Carter as president he has become quite an author, and this book is as much eloquent as it is matter of fact. Carter describes honestly the understood racial segregation of the time, and his relationship with his father, Earl, which he describes as more professional than intimate.<br />Carter's childhood story is sad and inspiring. Sad because farming, a honorable way of life, is disappearing, and inspiring because Carter embodies that childhood myth that anyone can grow up to be president.	2001-10-23

Although less than 100 pages from cover to cover, this book contains so much valuable information on the founding of the country, including facts on many of those who guided the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. The book also contains the Decleration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and key dates and Supreme Court cases that have shaped this country and the Constitution's interpretation.<br />This book is a keeper for all who cherish our freedom and should be read and re-read as a reminder of why this is a great country and why it prospered in relatively short order.	2001-10-18

I am in no position to debate the religious accuracy of the authors' interpretation of the Rapture. Although I am God-fearing, I am not a practicing member of any religious establishment.<br />From a literary perspective, I believe this to be a solid work as it lays the ground work of the books in the series that follows. The plot was solid and the ending well done. Yes, this is a work of Christian fiction, and those on the intellectual establishment are likely to be offended by the authors dissing of its point of view. Yet, that's probably precisely why this series is so popular. Religion is more an influence in Americans lives than the left would like us to believe.	2001-10-17

This book has no energy whatsoever.<br />The author tries to accomplish two goals with one book and fails miserably. He tries to create an historical account by showing the perspective of the prospective Vietnam infantryman. Yet this is supposed to be a novel, and it lacks depth and intrigue. The main character is nothing more than a symbol of the anti-war movement and too cliched to care about.<br />The plot might have been more interesting, but the storyline was too cheezy, particlarly when eight days after he lost it Adams finds the knife his grandfather gave him in a pile of pine needles. <br />Also, the dialogue is so elementary and the relationships Adams forges with his roommates so sudden, it makes the ending implausible. Who knew these guys were that close?<br />Obviously, this is more a commentary against the military lifestyle, along with a heavy anti-relgious slant. I was astonsished to learn that during military training soldiers actually talk and learn how to kill people. No, really?	2001-10-10

One Order of Crow!: Inside the Strangest Presidential Election Finish in American History	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Waiter deilvers	Jeff Greenfield is one of the few television talking heads worth watching, and he's proven why in this witty and astute political analysis of last year's presdential election. He ripped through the arguments on both sides, particularly the sham that went on in Florida from both camps.<br />However, my only criticism of the book is Greenfield's refusal to judge too harshly the media's role in the debacle on Election Night. As a journalist myself, and a sportswriter to boot, I'm used to hearing a voice come over the loud speaker telling me at a football game that rooting from the press box is strictly prohibited. After all, it is supposed to be a working media environment. Greenfield doesn't dispute that he and his colleagues were cheering the closeness of this race, which I believe influenced the networks lag time in calling Bush states. When it comes to calling back Florida, Greenfield doesn't criticize the media. Greenfield asking for crow comes off as if he said, &quot;Oops, our bad.&quot;<br />Greenfield's analysis clearly shows that the frenzy surrounding this election was media driven. Only 2 percent more of the public voted in the 2000 race than it did in the 1996 election, and that can probably be attributed to the Democrats get-out-the-vote effort. The irony of it all is that the networks still cut corners and were ultimately exposed in the VNS debacle.<br />Greenfield pulls no punches throughout book when the topics are politics. I wish he had delivered a more critical rebuke of his industry.	2001-09-28

Ellroy's fast-paced prose delivers a TKO to the heart of the Kennedy Camelot empire. The work takes on a simple theme -- the thurst for power and money --- but at the pen of Ellroy, it is transformed into the complex web of watch-your-back, whose-side-are-you-on politics. At times shady and tragic characters like Kemper, Pete and Ward provide an inside into a 1960s America few &quot;mainstream&quot; historians would prefer not dip their toes. Although I am not in a position to completely dissect factually the plot Ellroy lays out, the work is so convincing that it is seems implausible to simply brush it off as conspiracy garble. This is my first Ellroy novel, and I can't wait to read A Cold Six-Thousand.	2001-09-26

Brandon Sladder spends far too much of his energy quoting from various literary sources and spends less time in the real world. I had no use (and I guess that's the author's point) for a man who struggles to find a meaningful relationship while he's in bed, so to speak, with Deputy Secretary X and calling the World Series an autumnal ballet. Not to mention the author makes a serious mistake by calling Wrigley Field in Chicago Wrigley Park. I suppose that's the inherent irony in Frank's protagonist.

It's almost like the old man on the corner telling the kid with an earring how in his day kids were more respectful and dignified. Then when you acutally digest what he has to say, you realize: Hey, the guy's right on target. The business of news has been killing the coverage of news not just on TV but in newspapers for years. The public just has no tolerance for substance, which has direct linkage to the television era. We live in a world of 10-minute segments. If I see another shot of Robert Downey Jr. in a courtroom, I'm throwing the remote through the wall. But aside from the unnessary name-dropping, Hewitt's autobiography succeeds in that it is entertaining and biting at the same time. It's a perfect volume to a career that tried to achieve the same kinds of goals in his news show.	2001-08-27

Because of the vastly higher financial stakes in college football today, there will never again be a hellish camp like the one Jim Dent so richly portrays in this book about Texas A&amp;M in the late summer of 1954.<br />The obvious question is, of course, why would anyone subject himself to flat out torture for the sake of 60 minutes of glory on Saturday afternoons? As Dent shows, the reader must first understand the players' desperations to remain in college or face a lifetime at a harsh dead end.<br />In essence, it's a predicament those who never face will never understand. Many of the Junction Boys had two options with seemingly the same end: either die right there on the field trying or return home and agonize the rest of their lives regretting every second.<br />Of the many who quit, most went on with their self-respect in tact yet always held a grudge towards Bear Bryant for setting them up to fail.<br />Whatever your opinion is on Bryant's tactics, there is no question that he is a true original in every sense. No one will ever be able to get away with what he did at Junction, risking his kids' lives for a lesson in desire. College football is too much of a business to have investments playing with broken hips and jaws, although to an extent plaeyrs still play with emmense pain.<br />Football may never be called America's pasttime, but it is definitely the nation's passion -- for better or for worse.<br />To understand why, read about what drove the Junction Boys.	2001-08-14

The story was beautifully written and unlike Richard Ford's The Sportswriter, Friedman was able to tell a much better story in 150 less pages..<br />Any brothers can pick up this story and immediately relate, whether you are older or younger. Joe, the narrator, represented the typical Californian liberal, always needing to be stroked and noticed in order to feel good about himself. Unfortunately, it was too late before he realized his incessant hatred toward his brother was ill-advised and ill-conceived. The simple lesson, as Joe learned through his brother's success and fall from baseball, was that being on top isn't always the best view.

Unfortunately, the narcissistic world Jordan created has led to &quot;tall millionaires fighting short millionaries,&quot; referring to players constantly wanting more money from their rich owners.<br />With the emergence of Jordan, the concept of team in the NBA has gone competely out the window.

In no other novel are his characters as rich as Luke and Eli Chandler are, full of down home wit and fire.<br />The story plays out in a series of unfortunate events and reaches a predetermined end, which is the envitable halt to the harvet season. The predictability hurts the overall plot and completely eliminates any sort of true climatic moment. With a few storylines unresolved, it almost begs for a sequel.<br />Nevertheless, the book shines by the detailed writing, which in Grisham's case is from the heart. The book is semi-autobiographical. He proves that his typewriter isn't just a novel factory but a place where his mettle as a skilled writer shines through.<br />It makes you hope that Grisham would cut the lawyers loose more often.	2001-02-11

Although not Yale.<br />This was my first Perrotta novel, and though some of the criticism is harsh, I found the narrator somewhat interesting even if a bit unrealistic. How many things can bounce off one person without him even getting the remote hint of responsibility?<br />People like Danny, the main character, are people you love to hate.

At times, the flowery descriptions were too rich, but cutting away the Beverly Hills facade, the reader takes away a telling look at how complex relationships become.<br />While more dialogue may have aided the reader, Martin doesn't bother. Instead, he allows you to see inside the heads of the dysfunctional Mirabelle and the others to get an idea of their innermost thoughts with cutting situational analysis. <br />I did find the breakup to be a bit unrealistic. After painting Ray Porter to be a meticulous man, wouldn't he have realized that he was being used as a replacement for Mirabelle's father?<br />Overall, a nice effort.

It perplexes me that some have ripped him for not being &quot;objective&quot; in his well-written and thoughtful book. He is a news analyst, and only a journalist in as much as he gathers the pertinent facts before hand. His show is based on a philosophy of vetting out the so-called objective journalism based mainly on talking points. Bill goes out of his way to explain the premise of his show regularly.<br />For someone who graduated from one of the best public school journalism programs in the country, I believe O'Reilly meets the objectivity quotient by not taking sides and being tough on everyone.

While his liberal foes cringe, every  independently-minded American should give Stein's views a chance. For the  naysers of this book, especially hardcore liberals, I found it interesting  that many of the facts Stein used to back up his positions were pulled out  of the liberally-slanted media he so accurately portrays.	2000-08-30

He stiches the plot together meticulously, but the characters the reader should most care about  -- Nicholas and Marlee -- were shortchanged in the end. Marles's motivation  is skimmed over, though extremely predictable. The climax was a giveaway 50  pages before it happened. But Grisham's storytelling power was still  maintained, yet the ending was a bit unrealistic.	1999-12-10
