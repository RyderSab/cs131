My sister with impecable taste in reading material loaned this to my Wife.  I got to it first.  That is to say, I couldn't find a book I was looking for, and this one was sitting on the desk.  I scanned the back, and took a look.  I devoured the book in two 3-hour sittings.<br /><br />As a Buddhist (Soto Zen) and a Christian (Anglican; my Priest calls me a Buddheo-Christian)I have grown accustomed to people that don't truly understand either path telling me that the arrangement is simply not \\"possible\\".  I honestly felt like answering out loud when the holy men were telling Pi \\"You can't follow more than one religion!\\"  In my heart I wanted Pi to use the words I've used so often in my life \\"No, YOU can't follow more than one religion. God and I, however have no problem with it.\\"<br /><br />I must say that, while I've not heard much mention of it, Martel's wit is the gem that kept me captivated.  I found myself laughing out loud for much of the first half of the book.  Some points actually so funny that I would wake my wonderful, patient wife with my guffaws.  = )<br /><br />The ending was abrupt, and not as satisfying as I would like, but that is simply my opinion.

By most liberal standards I'm fairly conservative (and have been since waaaay before that PR*CK Bush made it an insult.)  But when I was bed ridden for weeks with a severe tear in my hamstring I became a little desperate for things to read.  When a more liberal friend brought RUSH LIMBAUGH IS A BIG FAT IDIOT in for me to read, I was, well, hesitant.<br />I read the entire thing in about 5 hours. . . Then I read it again, laughing my *ss off!!  My wife read it, and we then we began buying copies for our friends.  We gave copies out for Christmas and birthdays.<br />The short of it?  This book is genius.  It's pure unadulterated genius, and I love it. . . ALMOST as much as RUSH LIMBAUGH IS A BIG FAT IDIOT.  When it hits softcover, you can bet we'll be buying it by the case, as well.<br />Franken is smart, outspoken, funny, and worst of all, correct.  My party has fallen into a shameful pit of greed.  Being Republican used to mean that you were for bolstering the economy for ALL Americans.  It used to mean keeping an eye on the government so things like the &quot;patriot&quot; act (patriotic in title, ONLY) would never come to pass.  It used to mean that you were going to retire rich because you'd worked harder than others.<br />Please, oh please, young readers, do not judge all Republicans by the slanderous slimebag that oozes about the Oval Office these days; we do actually have a purpose. . .

I'm never quite sure what I'll be working on when I go out, so I like to pick up info on various animals when I can and just read ahead.  When I placed my order,  I was looking for a little more scientific data, but even without the clinical research I was most pleased with what showed up at my door!<br />Ms. Sherr's sincere passion for the creature is evident on every page, and the book itself is simply a pleasure to hold and read.  It has a nicely designed slick cover and the binding is top-notch.  This book will last for ages if taken care of, but as appealing as the images have been to my daugher, I have to keep a close eye on it.<br />There are interesting facts, and some fiction is dispelled.  There's tons of history and beautiful pix on every page.<br />No, the book is not the end-all be-all of information, but it is well worth the price, and there are even a few used ones for sale above (though not mine. . .  you can't have it. . . just back awaaaaay from the book.)<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone with a passing interest or even a non-veterinary passion for the animal!	2001-04-28

The only proof I have to offer is that I have absolutely nothing to gain by lying about it. . .<br />In september of 1996, I walked into my boss's office and informed him that I wouldn't be back the next day.  I have a feeling that he knew I wouldn't be coming back the next week. .  Or the next month, either.  As a  7-year member of a Fortune 500 management team, I had to deal with some fairly stressful situations.  I needed a break.  A big one.<br />Brian, the understanding boss, stood up, shook my hand, turned around and took this book off his shelf.  &quot;I've always wanted to go&quot; And with that he, almost sadly, handed me the tome.<br />I went home, cancelled my paper, had my mail stopped, made arrangements for a neighbor to feed my fish and started packing.<br />2 kites, 1 touring bike, 1 fly rod, 1 fly vest, 3 changes of clothes and 1 plane ticket later I was sitting staring out the window of a largish plane listening to a Nun tell me about the last flight she'd taken (from Ireland) and how she got air sick.  This was to be her second flight.<br />Now the point of this little aside -  Over the next 8ish hours, the Nun and I (she didn't get sick) read every page to one another.  She had lived in Ireland for 40 some years and still hadn't heard of all the palces and sights in this book.  It's that good.  I visited small out of the way places that I figured would be overrun, only to find that they were just as had been explained in the DK book.  I even took 2 walking tours with my new friend in the habit.<br />The book doesn't pretend that it will have every B&amp;B listed in it's pages, nor should you expect it to.  the &quot;Bord Failte&quot;, or the &quot;Irish Board of Welcomes&quot; puts out a comprehensive listing of all B&amp;B's in the country that are approved as far as having met their requirements.  Anyway, pick that and a 10 punt phone card up at any news dealer in the airport even before you look for a cab.<br />As far as good pubs, just wait until 6:30 and hook up with the frst large group you see walking around.  They'll be glad to take you with them.  The whole country is just sickeningly friendly.  And they're not looking for a tip.  I had a waitress run to catch me on the street when I left a tip at my table.  Had I been listening on the plane, the book explains who does and who doesn't expect a tip, where to hail a cab, the best places for lunch, what you want to do and why.<br />3 months later, I returned home with a completely different attitude about the world.<br />Anyway, the book has well earned it's stars as far as I'm concerned.<br />I can strongly recommend this book. . .

This is the WOW book to which the title refers. . .  It is, for lack of a better description, &quot;everything you need it to be&quot;.<br />As a Clinical Massage Therapist I have become accustomed to dealing with physicians and their patients. . . When I got a call from a VET I was, well, taken aback.  Having been a CCMT for many years, I knew what to expect and where to find problems in a HUMAN, but this book filled in absolutely every gap I could have come up with in regards to equine physiology, anatomy, kinesiology and the basics of &quot;don't do this around a horse if you want to make it to your next patient&quot; . . .<br />To start off with, it's spiral bound so it's super easy to take to the stable!  The illustrations are terrific and the text doesn't speak to you like you're a fifth grader; it assumes that if you're working on horses, you at least know the basics of working on humans.  And finally, it's encouraging. . .  It let's you know some of the pitfalls before they happen and how to avoid them.<br />I'm really glad I picked this one up!<br />I strongly recommend it for anyone interested in Equine Massage!	2001-01-30

As a Clinical Massage Therapist at a hospital, I use these books almost daily.  In fact, I just ordered my second set. . . The first is so threadbare it's barely usable.  ANYTIME I have a patient with a pain that I can't immediately identify I grab my Travell's.  This set is an absolute BIBLE for anyone in the health care industry.  Travell and Simons have esentially written &quot;The Instruction Manual&quot; for elliminating myofascial pain by going to it's source!<br />Janet Travell, MD and David Simons, MD were absolute pioneers when it came to myofascial pain and it's treatment.  What makes these books even more amazing is that they were written a full quarter of a century before doctors even acknowledged that myofascial pain actually exsisted. . . What makes them interesting is that, in this, the most current edition, they have re-evaluated about 65% of the sites that before would only be considered for cortizone or saline injection and now recommend these areas be attended to by a Massage Therapist.  They even go into strong detail as to stroke, direction and stretching.  There are still plenty of sites that they recommend for injection, but only in a last resort situation.<br />The chapters are laid out in an incredibly easy to understand manner, though that's not even the beauty of the book's design.  If you know the name of the muscle in question, you simply look inside the front cover; the muscle are all listed with their coresponding page numbers next to them.  Don't know the name or not sure which muscle it is in the group?  No problem.  You again open the front cover and there, in 5th grade simplicity, are charts for all the areas covered in the book.  Flip to the area in question and look through the diagrams.  When you find (in the super well drawn diagrams) the pain you are trying to treat, you are given, not only several treatment plans, but etiology and most likely direct verve aggravation associated with the pain.<br />My only problem with the set is that the book are not as well bound as maybe they could be for the price.  You'll notice, however, that it didn't have enough of an impact on me to give it any less that a perfect score.<br />I STRONGLY recommend this book for ANY health care practitioner that deals with pain control and alleviation.et is that the book are not as well bound as maybe they could be for the price.

Wendy Northcutt has done a great job of cutting the urban legends out and providing the reader with a nuts and bolts, &quot;this really happened, so be afraid&quot; kind of book!<br />Please don't buy this book thinking it has anything to do with Darwinism. . .  I hesitate to add that, but according to a friend at a book store, there have actually been people that held this belief.  This book is about the odd, humorous and often bizarre ways that people, which should likely have been taken out of the gene pool anyway, have offed themselves (or come close to it).<br />You will wonder if what you are reading is true, but Northcutt is careful to be VERY specific in the details, should you decide to check them out yourself!  In the case of urban legends (stories of things that happened to your brother's girlfriend's Uncle's third cousin) Northcutt has included some that you've probably heard, and some that are regionally specific. (Yes, the man that tied balloons to a lawn chair and drifted thousands of feet in the air is true. . . The guy that strapped a rocket to his car-wheelchair-bike is not)<br />Buy this book for humor value, if nothing else.<br />I recommend this book.	2001-01-22

As a rule, I don't concern myself with compilation cook books.  I simply don't like the &quot;K-Tel&quot; feel of the disjointed conglomerations of food from cooks that may or may not have even heard of one another.  This book is surprizingly cohesive.  The recipes are not really ones that I would have sought out individually, but of the ones my wife and I have tried, we've been pleased with the results.<br />This is certainly not the end-all be-all of the cooking world in a book, but there are some surprizes for those willing to experiment.  Not the least of which really is the fact that these recipes are inexpensive.  I was kind of shocked.  Okay, I was really shocked.  The ingredients aren't that tough to find, either.  I've actually bought books that I still have yet to find some of the ingredients listed, but they offer &quot;substitute&quot; ingredients. . .  It really makes me wonder what the real ingredient would have done for the flavor.<br />Why not 5 stars?  Regardless of the recipes that I liked, it is still a compilation cookbook, and there are some pretty far to one side or the other recipes.

I really don't know what Harvey Diamond had in mind when he started his pyramid scheme (by the same name) in the 80's, but if this book is the end product of all of his research and education, I STRONGLY advise him to actually crack the nutrition books next go 'round!!<br />Between a combination of the lack of ANY form of research and the fact that it is virtually devoid of any realistic, contemporary nutritional guidelines, this book truly stretches the boundaries of what a nutritional guidebook can or should be.  As far as a &quot;diet and health plan&quot;, there is none.  It's simply not one of the things they included.  &quot;Be healthy&quot; is really the best advice given.  <br />You can't just &quot;decide&quot; that certain foods should not be eaten together or they cause &quot;toxins&quot; in the body and you die. . .  C'mon!  Do a little math!  Better yet, do a little RESEARCH!!  Not even a lot- just SOMETHING to offer proof that ANY of your theories are based in reality.  Not only do the &quot;theories&quot; in this book not match any in the modern medical community, some are just downright ridiculous!!<br />While this book may be useful as joke material for any and all nutritional educators that happen to pick it up, looking through some of the loosely formulated (and completely unsubstantiated) theories in the book, it makes me wonder how many people's health has been ruined by listening to advice of this calibre.  &quot;Don't mix different kinds of proteins&quot;. . . WHAT?!?  &quot;Don't mix proteins and carbs&quot;. . . Brilliant. . .   &quot;Eat ONLY fruit before noon&quot;?!?!!  Here's one Harvey, why don't you tell people to just avoid food altogether so they can just starve to death instead of leading them into full blown Diabetic keytosis!!<br />Why did I give the book one star?  Simple.  A bright red skull and crossbones with the words &quot;DANGER-LIFE THREATENING ADVICE&quot; wasn't one of the options.<br />Don't agree with what I have to say?  Don't take my advice.  Call your doctor.  Call a nutrition counselor.  Call the lunch lady at your kid's school!  Call ANYONE that might know more about nutrition than your average New York taxi driver because it's obvious that Harvey Diamond doesn't, and that makes this book dangerous.  It started out as a fad diet connected to a pyramid scheme and it made Diamond rich enough to continue to market this awful, misleading book in to the present day.<br />I strongly recommend AVOIDING this book.	2001-01-09

In addition, she spends muuuuuuch less time stuffing her personal ideas of how your house should be laid out down your throat. . .  This book has dozens of DIFFERENT ideas to work with including lots of schematics.<br />In her previous book she was, well, confused as to how many of us still have family dinner in an actual dining room and a few other misconceptions.  These mistakes has been corrected and the end product is a book that combines form with fashion to produce some really interesting living space inside an area that most would consider cramped.  Now if she could just explain how to get my wife (beautiful and intelligent as she is) to keep her stinkin' shoes off the floor in our own small space I'd give her the other star.<br />I like the floor plans included as well as the explanations used for using different materials and lighting.

Maybe. . .	&quot;Dear Lord, thanks for sending the Worst Case Scenario book.  Now please make sure I never, ever, ever have to use it.&quot;<br />At first shot I thought this book was another &quot;duct tape book&quot;; cute idea, neat application, no real use. . .  Then I read just ONE of the chapters.  I finished it the same night.<br />Could you land an airplane?  I can.  Reattatch a finger?  Me too.  Survive an earthquake, air raid or nuclear attack?  Great, meet me at the door jamb and don't forget the olives!<br />This book gives you the framework for surviving all kinds of disasters that you hear about on the news every stinkin' day, but know you'll never be involved in.  And it does it in such a matter of fact, don't get all worked up about it way that you might even remember someof the information- Heaven forbid you should ever need it.  I though the Boy Scouts were prepared before; this should be their new handbook!<br />I highly recommend this book, and hope like anything you'll never use the information contained within.	2000-12-31

Generally when I used think about home improvements (indoor or out) I thought about calling somebody (experienced or not) to help me with it. It was usually at this point that the neighbors would bring their kids inside. . . Just to be safe. . .  To be honest, until just after I bought this book (a year ago) I didn't think I had the inate skills needed to do something as alien to modern men as replacing a fawcet washer, much less replacing the whole fawcet and installing a greenhouse!! This book, aside from not being very good at helping you lift heavy things, is all the help you will need to complete hundreds of different improvement projects in and around your house.<br />The skill gauge is very acurate in it's time estimates and tells you what level of skills you should have before starting a project - This is helpful if only so you can put your local fire department on call. With all the information on tools, their usage, and the type, amount and quality of materials you will need this book could make Homer Simpson look like Martha Stewart. . . Well, maybe more like Tim Allen, but you get the point.<br />I highly recommend this book and the Home Depot &quot;HOME IMPROVEMENTS 1-2-3&quot; book as well!! Truly money well spent!	2000-12-31

Simply too much categorical, mind numbing data (that isn't actually used on a game-by-game basis) to maintain any sort of interest.  If it were a book on chess problems then it may have made sense to break down sooooo many possible variables, but it's not; it's a book loosely based on Will's belief of how the game should really be viewed and it makes osmosis seem exciting.<br />As a rule, I find most of Mr. Will's writings to be interesting; even insightful. . . Unfortunately to all rules, there must be an exception. I picked up the book thinking that Will would be able to answer questions about the game and it's inner workings. How very disappointing.	2000-12-31

I picked it up to pass an hour that I had before an appointment and have since crawled through the entire book numerous times. I've made almost half of the recipes as is evident by the ingredients ground into the pages themselves. . .<br />Having lived in 12 countries and half a dozen states in this one, I have found that I love food.  All food.  Food from everywhere.  All of it.  This book has recipes from all over the country and the world and most are as I remembered them!  All are tasty, even if some are on the &quot;Why would I spend that much time on a snack&quot; side.<br />The chapters are laid out with easy to follow instructions and photos for every recipe!  Recipe books without pics are a real pet peve of mine.  Granted, I only have 40 some-odd recipe books, but I have found, invariably, that those that have the food represented in a visual manner are those that I go back to more often.  Food is as much a visual experience as it is one of scent or taste.<br />There isn't much by way of history, but then again you're already getting more than what the title promises!<br />Why not 5 stars?  It's a good cook book.  It's not a GREAT cookbook.  The author doesn't make suggestions as to alternate ingredients and many of the ingredients used would have to be purchased specifically for the preparation of the snack.  This small problem aside, this book is well worth having.	2000-12-31

I'm on my fourth copy of this book.  Mine tend to vanish like the morning dew juat as my neighbors begin their spring garage cleanup. . .  My bro-in-law has one as well, but he insists that the fact that my name is written in indelible SHARPIE marker on the front is just a tribute to me and my helpful nature. . .  This book has more helpful hints in introduction than most do in the first 5 chapters.  And it just goes on and aon and on!<br />With actual real life applications for stuff you'll find lying around your garage (from old buckets to wire to old useless hose), this book is a true boon for anyone looking to clean up their act (and their garage) and make the time they have to spend on projects less of a fight to just keep the cords straight!<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone that knows they own at least 4 tape measures, but can't find one to save their lives!<br />Well worth the cost, and as well constructed as the book is, it will last a lifetime!	2000-12-31

As the founding &quot;Father&quot; of a group of at-home-dads I'm always on the hunt for any kind of helpful resource to pass on to my Dads.  This book has proven to be one of the most well received.  As any of you that have read my other reviews know, I RARELY give 5 stars.  This book is just that well put together.<br />The book doesn't dwell on the fact that Fatherhood is just now coming into it's own. Instead, it presents basic Dad-stuff info in an easily digestible and accurate fashion in combination with some pretty humorously drawn pix.<br />Each topic, from tying shoes to riding a bike to tying a tie (roughly) takes about a page or so and presents it's information fairly in depth, but still very easily read.  Imagine this as the little yellow book you got for your driver's test; there's 10,000 other things you'll need to know also, but this will help you pass the tests that tend to show up every few months after the age of 4.<br />I highly recommend this book for any new Dad; At-home or not!!	2000-12-24

As a Clinical Massage Therapist I am always looking foraccurate information to pass on to my patients (at the Hospital) andclients (in my private practice).  I have found all of the AmercanCollege books to be accurate and timely enough to have confidence whengiving them out that I am providing a good resource.  If I did not, Icertainly would not recommend them here!<br />Why not 5 stars?  For thesimple reason that the authors STILL are not taking into considerationthe massive amount of Medically proven information availableconcerning Massage Therapy when making recommendations for treatment.It may just be the fact that &quot;when you live your life as ahammer, every problem looks like a nail&quot;, but with over 300medical journal articles written since Sep, 1997 touting thebeneficial effects of Massage Therapy for everything from chronic painto migraines to breast pain and the prevention of cancers, it seemsthat there would be SOME kind of mention of it in a book produced byThe American College of Physicians.<br />Aside from this one complaint, Ihave found this to be an EXCELLENT book and would recommend it foranyone with chronic headaches!	2000-12-23

FIRST, A WORD ON HEALTH CARE PUBLICATIONS-<br />When looking for a book on almost any subject, it's always a good bet that DK books will have one on the subject. And whereas the overwhlming majority of them will be accurate in their presentation, it is good to remember that ALL information about health is subject to regular change and update.<br />Unfortunately, Doctors and nurses simply don't have the time needed to constantly pour over new journal articles and go to seminars.  This is why WE must keep OURSELVES informed by doing just that.  Medical libraries are FREE for use by anyone in this country that pays their taxes and their staff knows this and are more than happy to help you learn how to use them.  They know that by doing this we are not only increasing our own knowledge of current practices and procedures, but we are actually creating an invaluable resource for our healthcare providers.<br />If your Doctor tells you that you have a condition that they are not familiar with, go to the medical library and look up any journal articles that have come out in the past year on the subject and make two (2) copies.  Take one to your Doctor and keep one for yourself.  The positive response you get may surprise you, and it will certainly prove to your health care provider that you are interested in being proactive in your recovery.<br />THE REVIEW!!<br />As a Clinical Massage Therapist and Father, I can tell you from experience that this book is not only well written and contains some really cute pictures, but the information contained within is mostly accurate and very easily digested.  I have heard of both of the contributing authors and can say that both have good reputations in their fields.<br />Why not 5 stars?  For the simple reason that the authors STILL not only illustrate the Indian &quot;milking&quot; technique, but recommend it.  Being the only obvious and unmistakeable flaw in the book, it is excusable, but only just.<br />Indian milking is not only counter productive to the massage itself, but it does physically irreversible damage to the valves in the veins in the arms and in the legs.  You should never, never, NEVER work from hip to foot or shoulder to arm; ALWAYS work with the flow of the vein, or in this case, towards the heart.  To not do so is to force blood to move AGAINST natural veinous flow and can cause the leaflet valves in the veins returning blood to the heart to become damaged and useless.<br />Later on in life, this damage will cause painful vericose and spider veins.  If you have anyquestion of this or of the medical research that proves it, just look on the legs of almost any East Indian man or woman and almost invariable you will see evidence of vericosities.  There are even pamphlets being produced in India that are telling Mothers to work towards the heart to prevent this from happening.<br />Aside from this one problem, this is an EXCELLENT book.  I say that not only because any book that promotes this kind of bonding with parent and child is on my &quot;A&quot; list, but also because the vast majority of the information is accurate and correct!ly counter productive to the massage itself, but it does physically irreversible damage to the valves in the veins in the arms and in the legs.

If you aspire to loftier goals, pass on this one and go look on the shelf of the most successful Massage Therapist in town; those are the book that you want.<br />The A&amp;L is really pretty much just a prep book for the NCBTMB, so don't grab it expecting &quot;PATHOLOGY FOR MASSAGE THERAPISTS&quot; or &quot;SOFT TISSUE MANIPULATION&quot;, because it's simply not that detailed.<br />Think about everything you know about driving a car.

Much like a computer manual, this is a book that could be rewritten twice a year and still stay 3 months behind.  As much as the Massage Therapy community and profession change on an almost daily basis, it would be almost impossible to mass produce any kind of book (short of a magazine) and keep it cutting edge.<br />The book DOES still have plenty of things to make it well worth the price, and it's all in one volume.  There is only one mag that has proven itself to be worth reading and it (MASSAGE) will cover about 3/4 of the info contained herein in about a year.<br />The chapter on MONEY MANAGEMENT  gives the same excellent advice that my Grandfather gave me 20 years ago when it comes to smart investments of time and money.  It's certainly as useful today as it was then.  If you're planning on going it alone in the business, I strongly suggest you at least borrow a friend's copy and read that chapter.<br />There is also a great chapter on marketing on a budget.  There are those that say that a good Massage Therapist doesn't need to advertise, and in-as-much as many Therapists work alone, they are correct.  I have 12 Therapists in 2 offices, 3 clinics and 3 hospitals. . . I do a small amount of marketing simply to educate the general public (and the medical community) on what's available; this book made that an easy thing.  We also advertise our seminars (we do about a dozen free infant massage classes and roughly the same number of stress management courses a year) and this chapter helped me save some money there.<br />There is also some plain, common sense kinda' stuff that you just need to hear from more than one person before you believe it.  I won't ruin the book by spilling it here, but there really is a lot of good material in this tome!  If you don't know someone with this book, buy it or wait for the next edition to come out- It's really due!<br />There's a reason that this book (slightly outdated as it may be) is regularly used in Massage schools across the country.the country.	2000-12-09

With little success.  Peanut butter and Jelly?  I won't  even justify that with the much deserved  &quot;PUHHHLEEEEEEEASE&quot;!<br />The book is short of facts, shorter on  technique and devoid of any history whatsoever.<br />Well over half the  rolls are either western concoctions or creations straight from the  author's imagination.  Some of my fav's being the &quot;Eggs McSushi  Roll&quot; (Tamago), the &quot;Anchovy and Sun dried Tomato Roll&quot;, the  &quot;Mussel Shoals Roll&quot; and what Japanese cookbook would be complete  without the &quot;Prosciutto and Cantaloupe Roll&quot;. . .  There's always  the &quot;Blackened Catfish Roll&quot; for those of you with a taste for  Cajun Sushi.  And for you Brit's, how about the &quot;Tomato and Cucumber  Roll&quot;. . .

I really wanted to like this book more than I did.  I've just gotten into Tin-Litho toys and I wanted my first fairly expensive (for it's size) book to contain at least SOME the information I required.  No go.<br />There is  information on the manufacturers, but it is extremely limited, and not very  tight.  In some cases, the information is limited to half a page or so. . .  And this was on one of the biggies.<br />There are tons of pix, but not in  color.  That's a big part of Tin-Litho!  If you don't know what the color  was to begin with, how do you know what condition it's in now?<br />Another  problem I had with the book is the valuation scale that the author kind of  thought up.  With as many different (and accepted) scales to determine the  value of a collectible today, it seems odd to me that she needed to invent  another.  It's sort of like re-inventing the wheel; Sure, you COULD. . .  But why?<br />Again, I'd like to be able to give more credit to this book, but  it's just not there. . .
