Each one of them is so concerned about what they want, who hurt them, and I can not believe he or she did that to me.<br /><br />Not being a selfish person, I could garner no love, repect , nor feelings of sympathy for the main characters.  At one point I was so disgusted  with Carla, Betty Jean and Zeke, I put the book down.  The secondary characters Sheila and Thomas were the strong ones who showed feelings for others and live in th real world.<br /><br />A superbly written book ARE YOU SATISFIED, YET is the first in a series of books about Betty Jean.  I hope in the return of Betty Jean in GETTING UP AND GETTING ON, Betty Jean becomes a character that can be identified with.	2005-05-12

Lynn brings Raymond back to New York, to work for Bling, Bling where the owner, Davis and the Editor-in-Chief, Zola do not care that he is gay as long as he gets the job done.  In A Love of My Own, Harris not only tells a great story but brings us face to face with the crash of 9/11 and the tragic death of the songbird Aaliyah.

Numerous characters, plots and sub plots jumping all over.  It is hard to keep up with the story line as no character was clearly developed.  From the prolouge we jump 5 years, with the entire story crammed into a 24 hour day.  Every other chapter a new character is introduced, without the connection to the previous characters being made clear.<br />There is a sentence in the story that says &quot;He never knew where he would be from one day to the next.&quot;  I had the same ambivalent feeling about the book, I did not know where it was going from one page to the next.<br />Mr. Dunson gave us numerous secrets, lies and murders to be the makings of a great mystery, but did a poor job of tying then together into a readable story.  Wonderful creativity, horrible writing and editing. The story just kept going and going.  With the sequel Day Two, I can only hope Mr. Dunson makes it clearer.<br />Reviewed by Toni Bonita, APOOO BookClub	2002-09-17

Nina was a strong black woman considering all she had been through. At times I saw her strength as a weakness  for her; then she would loose control, but she always pulled it back together.The women who were her supporting cast, Donna, Anna, Ronnie had the same strength. Each one was strong in her on way. I only gave it 4 stars because, I relly thought that in the end we could bring Nate Ford down, when she took the case with a Anna, I thought there were two goals to get Malika back and to bring Nate  Ford down.	2001-07-31

Books	3	0	0	N	N	Slow But Moving	The first 3 chapters had me somewhat confused as to who the main characters were going to be because they talked about Betty and Evander in  away that led me to beleive  he was a main character not a supporting one. Not until the end of chapter 4 did I get the since that  it was Drew and Betty. It too long to get to the hook.  After chapter 4 I couldn't wait to see what was going to take  place next.  If we could all have a friend to talk to the way Betty and Drew did, before they finally met each other.  I am  going to start reading the sequel Forever tonight, I only hope it gets off to as better start.	2001-07-19

Ava getting her comeuppance,Basil relizing that Raymond had always loved him; and getting the child he always wanted was iceing on the cake. They all fell down but they all got up. Each character finding closure for his life,the things they had done rather right or wrong; even the newest one Bart. E. Lynns best work todate in the series and I have read and own them all. BRAVO, BRAVO, BARAVO.	2001-07-12
