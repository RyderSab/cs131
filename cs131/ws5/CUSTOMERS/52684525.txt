Ms. Mulvaney's description of how things hooked together from the present to the past was great.  I loved both the lead characters - Tasya and Ian, and Paulinho was a wonderful character who added greatly to the story.  The only thing that fell a little short was Richard - how he got from Point A to Point B, how he found Tasya at La Magia, how he could get a job there so quickly ... but this is fiction, and it wasn't that big a deal in the greater scheme of things.  I really enjoyed reading this book, and I haven't been able to say that about a lot of the paranormals I've read recently.  I guess I must be overdosing on vampires and werewolves.  This book was different - wonderfully and imaginatively written.  Highly recommended, and I look forward to reading more from this author.	2004-11-26

I know any book premised on two psychics out there working together has a suspension-of-disbelief requirement, but after awhile the plotting got to be a bit much.  George, the British-born (to parents in domestic service) ex-US Secret Service bodyguarding butler with CIA and FBI contacts everywhere; Carmela and Rosa, who with federal arm-twisting can be removed from a mother who won't protect them from abuse in the home and given to the heroine at the end of the book as sort of live-in domestic therapy; Trask, our evil-villain arsonist, who, while evading the forces of the US government could use his North-Korean-supplied US henchman to track down all sorts of information about our heroine's background and family, and who regrets that he won't have enough time available to explore the fact that he considers the heroine his soulmate before he has to kill her; and Silver (as in Hiyo?), who falls in love with the heroine for no earthly reason I could see, since she's an idiot and has been a complete b**ch to him, but because they're psychically linked, and he's really lonely, they have mind-blowing sex.  Her father's rationale for the nature of his relationship with Kerry and his son Jason made absolutely no sense to me.  And cliches?  They're everywhere, so watch where you step.  What a disappointment!	2004-10-16

Endless thoughts that go over the same ground, over and over and over... when at one point she said something like &quot;I'm such a moron,&quot; I thought wow, at last some real self-awareness.  She decides she loves Nick based on very little - particularly after she realizes that, while pain medication was affecting her resistance, he took advantage of her to foist off his annoying airhead cousin DeeDee on her, when he could just as easily have parked DeeDee in a hotel - and probably one that has French Provincial furniture, to boot - Loudon County is actually relatively close to DC, and it's not like DeeDee was doing anything in particular in Loudon County while she waited for her wedding day to roll around.  There were logic leaps and holes, unbelieveable characters, idiot behavior (Billie deciding to jump out of a cake at a bachelor party because all men are pigs, and if her fiance is going to root with the pigs, then she's going to make sure that she's the truffle), quirky characters who are more like fingernails on a blackboard than endearingly cute... et cetera et cetera...  Billie is priggish, selfish, self-absorbed, and completely spineless.  She lets herself get backed into marrying Nick because she's trying to keep DeeDee from fixing her up - she's only known DeeDee a day or two, but she apparently can't tell her no.  When DeeDee tells Raoul rather pointedly that he's not invited to the double wedding (it's family and politicians only, DeeDee says), even though Billie counts Raoul as a friend she just shrugs and says, basically, sorry you can't come.  She says she trusts Nick, but then her actions and endless ruminations show that she doesn't trust him at all.  Why they love each other is beyond me - Billie's rather like one of my sisters - the one my other sisters and I enjoy talking about when we get together because of all the annoying and stupid things she does.  I don't remember Full  Tilt being nearly this irritating, and I enjoy most of the Stephanie Plum novels (there was some serious sagging in the middle of the series), but this book just goes to show how a writer can learn and improve.  This novel should give hope to anyone that, with a little bit of luck, they, too, could be published.	2004-01-08

I love the Lynley/Helen/Havers relationships, and I like Simon, too, although I wish he didn't seem so insubstantial and insecure.  But Deb just annoys me, and therefore a book that focused on her and her feelings annoyed me.  Ms. George's books keep getting longer and longer, and the plots just can't stand up to all the talky weight that drags them down.  Crisper pacing and tighter plotting would help, and cutting the extraneous information, dialogue, and red herrings that really don't serve much purpose would also help.  It would be nice if she'd return to the writing/plotting skill she showed earlier in the series.	2003-08-12

She pretty much founded the Regency genre; both the short ones and the historicals owe a lot to her.  The other reviewers have helpfully discussed the book's merits.  I would simply add that, while I enjoyed this classic marriage-of-convenience story, I found the writing far more distant than what one might be accustomed to from today's authors.  I always knew I was reading.  I never felt like I was there inside the story with the characters.  She uses a lot of historically accurate terms and cant, which is interesting but does take you out of the story somewhat.  The meaning is obvious from the context, but you have to think about it all the same.  I plan to read a number of her other books, and I look forward to learning from her, but I'll be curious to see if I can feel more connected to the characters and the story as I go along.	2003-04-01

Absolute Power was gripping. In this book, I liked the hero, Web London, up to a point. I was hoping that his personal life would take more of an upward turn in the end, but maybe there's a sequel in the works? Given how the book stopped, there should be something in the works, since the ending was very disappointing. In addition, as has been pointed out, the book was too long and the plotting, while good, could have been tighter.<br />While I was reading, I kept thinking that the writing was awfully ham-handed, and that description and dialogue could have been better written. I kept thinking that the tone was \\"macho guy writing.\\" Even where the hero IS a macho guy, that doesn't need to bleed over into every aspect of the writing. If this book were in the first person, the tone would have made the narrator a caricature. There was also a lot of detail that, while it showed obvious research into a topic, didn't need to be in the story. It didn't advance anything, and tended to stop the action dead while I wondered what the point was.<br />One irritant (for me) - several times he referred to FBI agents as being woefully underpaid. I agree. However, to say that the pay was somehow equivalent to that of a cashier at K-Mart was, I thought, a bit much. He made it sound like any agent who had a family had to be on food stamps as well. All of the people who do the kind of work described in the book, from military special forces of all kinds through SWAT teams and the Hostage Rescue Team, are underpaid. But to equate the pay to that of a K-Mart cashier was, as you can tell, incredibly annoying to me (unless K-Mart cashiers are making a lot more than I think they are). Maybe that was part of what I found wrong with the book as well - that the author's use of hyperbole (the K-Mart example isn't the only one) was a bit much.<br />Would I read Baldacci again? Maybe - I started The Winner but couldn't finish it, although I have friends who recommend it highly. Was this book a total write-off? No, not really. I'd recommend it as a summer beach read. There are better and there are worse. It got off to a decent start, although it fizzled at the end. Overall, I liked the story, but I think the writing could have been better, the book shorter, and the story tighter.<br />If you want to read a gripping story about the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team, I'd recommend Christopher Whitcomb's book, Cold Zero: Inside the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team. Interesting, better written, and it has the advantage of being true.gh I have friends who recommend it highly. Was this book a total write-off? No, not really.

However, this book was rather tepid.  I didn't particularly sympathize with Nell, the heroine.  You'd think after running away and finding the fortitude to put herself through school and become an FBI agent that she'd have found it within herself to contact Max, our hero, at some point within the preceding twelve years.  I liked Max, and thought he'd been wronged, but he knew Nell was the love of his life, more's the pity, and he hung in there until she saw it, too.  She kept telling herself she couldn't tell him ... what?  When her big problem with actually telling him the truth is finally explained, it was in no way sufficient to explain or justify her behavior, in my mind.  And there were absolutely no clues to follow which could lead you to the murderer.  None.  There were a couple of false trails, but NO clues.  You only find out at the end, when the heroine is (literally) slapped in the face with it.  So, in the end, I don't really recommend this book.  I'm sure others will enjoy it, but I thought it was very weak.	2002-11-14

Only Carla Kelly can top Ms. Pickens.  The scene where Alex was finally reconciled with his brother was wonderfully moving.  The changes Alex underwent, and his reasons for them, were very believeable and well done.  The setting and the story line were very different from what one normally sees in a regency, and they gave the book that much more depth and interest.  The review below sets out the broad outline of the plot, so I won't add anything to that.  I will simply say that this book is a treat, I loved reading it, and I highly recommend it.	2002-11-07

I'm just not sure it's worth the effort when there are a lot of really great romance novels that are here and gone distressingly quickly.  Having the heroine initially locked in an abusive marriage rang true - women in that time really would have had nowhere to turn when trapped in such a situation.  Their husbands essentially owned them, and could pretty much do as they liked.  I liked the hero, Burke Drummond, and could see why he was attracted to Arielle, and she to him.  But the coincidental plans from two different people to abduct Arielle on the same day and in the same manner?  Hmmmm.  And Burke's belief that it was okay to kidnap Arielle in order to press his suit?  Kidnapping wasn't illegal back then?  I suppose English earls could get away with just about anything, but still....  And what's the deal with the cliche raging fever after being out in the rain for what seemed like a very short time?  She couldn't have been too out of it if she later remembered stories Burke told her while she was allegedly completely unconscious.  Plus, while allegedly unconscious, she did affirmatively respond to verbal commands to do things like say \\"I do\\" at her wedding, and to sign her name - as long as those commands were delivered in a stern tone of voice.  Double hmmmm.  The villains were okay, but Dorcas's problems (Dorcas was Arielle's old nurse/maid/compainion) later in the book were a little hard to buy into.  So, overall, this book was just average, and that's being really, really charitable.  Parts were good, parts not, and an awful lot was given to the reader through narrative, rather than shown through actions and dialogue.  I have read several of Catherine Coulter's books now, but primarily her contemporary novels.  I have several of her historicals waiting to be read, and I understand they're where her reputation was made.  And I do appreciate her candor when a book has been reissued, or rewritten and reissued (with this book she says she \\"just cleaned it up a bit,\\" rather than a complete rewrite) - I wish all authors would be so candid.  But I have yet to discover what made this author one with a large number of appearances on the NYT bestseller lists.  My recommendation on this book?  If you're a Coulter fan you've probably already read it.  If not, and you still want to, definitely look for it in a used book store or your local library if you feel compelled to read it.  With all those twenty-some-odd printings, it shouldn't be hard to find.	2002-10-16

Ms. Dalton's presentation of the heroine's injuries and partial amnesia was the most realistic I've ever read.  The characters have depth and are believeable.  The motivations and actions of the hero and heroine were understandable.  After finishing the book, I found myself thinking about Mitch and Katerina, their feelings, and how Mitch came to a greater understanding of himself, and Katerina came to understand Mitch's love for her and her own feelings after her injury.  I thought the story was very touching.  Once, again, I'm struck by how the quality of writing in a category romance can be excellent.  It's always a shame when a good story reaches a smaller audience than it deserves.	2002-04-24

The heroine is Capt. Valerie Wentworth, an Army protocol officer stationed at the Pentagon.  I was thrilled to see that Ms. Ashtree got all the pre-9/11 Pentagon details correct.  The hero is Viktor Baturnov, a colonel in the Russian Army assigned to the Pentagon for a month of training in U.S. Army supply procedures.  Col. Baturnov's ulterior motive, however, is to get his ailing son to the U.S. for much-needed heart surgery.  He's planned everything carefully, but he's on a very tight schedule, and when one thing backs up, everything else gets knocked off course as well, and the pressure on him mounts throughout the book.  Valerie knows she runs a real risk to her career if she helps him, but it's hard not to want to help him and his son.  Viktor's a great dad, and this aspect of his character is very appealing.  It makes it easy to see how Valerie could fall for him.  His character and commitment to his son would translate to a good relationship for her, as well.  He's handsome, caring, smart, and nice, and it doesn't take him long to figure out that Valerie is the one for him.  This was a very pleasant story, that progressed believably from initial meeting to the HEA.  It never felt strained.  The author writes well, and the story was engaging and flowed nicely.  I believed in the characters and their actions.  I wish Ms. Ashtree much success, and I'll continue to look for future books from her.	2002-04-04

I looked forward to buying this book, because I liked the story idea.  I'm a sucker for the amnesia angle, I have to admit.  I found it in the Atlanta airport a day before its official release, and read it on a trip to Las Vegas.  I finished it, but just barely, and more than once I was tempted to just leave it unfinished somewhere for someone else to bother with. I thought the writing was awful, and I didn't like the characters very much.  I can't understand being immediately physically attracted to the man when he's gaunt, physically wasted, heavily bandaged, and very near death.  It was apparently supposed to be some mystic psychic connection that arced between the two as soon as she laid eyes on his unconscious form, as far as I can tell.  I could understand feeling pity and sympathy, and I can understand Enid wanting to do her best for him as a conscientious nurse, but I didn't believe that instant attraction at all.  I also have a tough time with the thought that he was so far gone physically, but within a pretty short period of time he's Greek statue perfect, with relatively little effort that could accomplish this feat.  I don't understand why the relationship had to start out on such an unrealistic note, rather than growing over time as they each see things in the other that they would come to admire, respect, and love.  Enid certainly had every reason to hate her husband, based on the awful things he'd done to her, and the position he'd left her in when he walked out on her.  Enid would constantly reflect back on those things, but they seemed to have no real impact or relevance to her, and they certainly had no real effect on her behavior.  I just didn't believe in the characters' relationship, I didn't believe in its foundations, and I didn't believe in its growth.  As noted in the title, above, I thought the prose was a bit over the top.  It was like the writer was trying to drag me up the mountain, rather than letting the writing carry me along more naturally and freely.  I don't know if this review will prove helpful.  I just found the book annoying, and I was all the more disappointed for having so anticipated reading it with pleasure.	2002-03-20

I wish that audiobook readers, when confronted with words, usually place names, that they obviously don't know, would find someone to tell them the correct pronunciation.  For example, Narragansett is not pronounced na-RAH-gun-set.  Nor does  Leominster have any sound like &quot;Leo&quot; in it.  I only mention this because yes, it's a pet peeve, and it only serves to jerk me out of the flow of the book as it's read.  However, now that that's off my chest, please let me say that Scott Brick did an excellent job of bringing this book to life for me.  The book is dense with description, and I think it would be easy to become lost in it.  However, it all builds rich layers to characters that, however flawed, I came to care about.  Toward the end of the book I found myself in tears, which doesn't happen very often.  Every time I'd put the book down (stop the tape, actually), it would stay with me until I'd pick it up again.  I needed to know what would happen next.  I've read A Drink Before The War, and I enjoyed it tremendously.  My next task, and one I look forward to, is to go back and read Mr. Lehane's other books.

At the beginning, the hero and heroine were quite immature, but that was the point.  However, ten years later I don't think they'd advanced all that far.  The only thing that made their later relationship believable was the fact that they'd corresponded regularly over the course of ten years, and that correspondence meant a lot to each of them.  However, when they were reunited after ten years, they didn't seem to know that much more about each other than when they'd parted.  I thought the characters were entirely too modern in their attitudes and behavior, and I found it somewhat annoying.  I couldn't really lose myself in this book, and to me that's the whole point of reading fiction.	2001-04-17

Both English reviewers of this book were dead on in their assessment of it.  The plot was tissue thin.  The characters were shallow, their actions were not credible, and their development was nonexistent.  How the marquess came to the conclusion he loved Lucinda seemed driven simply by the fact that it was the end of the book, and therefore time to wrap things up.  As a minor note, a lot of the regencies I've read have fairly dense, small type, which is necessary to get a fully fleshed out story into the usual number of pages.  The type in this book is rather large, and there is a lot more unoccupied space on a page than I'm accustomed to seeing in other regencies, which I think is rather telling.  I've come to enjoy regencies as pleasant entertainment, but some are definitely better than others.  This is the first one by Ms. Chesney that I've read, and she seems to have a decent reputation so perhaps I'll seek out another one and give it a try.  However, with better books out there, I cannot recommend this one.	2001-01-24

The dialog is stilted, and all too often the characters make  speeches rather than conversation.  Too much is told rather than shown, and  the telling is stilted, too.  How these two fell in love isn't quite clear.   Too many elements of the plot simply didn't ring true, either.  I, too,  love the premise of the wounded hero who is healed, in every sense, by the  love of the heroine.  However, with these two people it simply wasn't  believable, and with the writing being so formal there was simply too much  distance between the reader and the story.

The characters were strong, and their motiviations were understandable and consistent with their characters.  The  physical intimacy between the hero and the heroine, while explicit, served  to move the story forward and built a better understanding of the  characters, particularly Thomas, over time.

Tortured but strong, so full of love for Madeleine, so afraid it wouldn't  be returned, but willing to gamble everything that, if she got to know him,  her love for him would come with time.

The plot spun wildly out of control, I completely  lost touch with the hero, and I thought the heroine completely  unbelieveable - particularly her turnaround regarding the hero at the very  end of the book.  I'm more than willing to suspend my disbelief if the  story is good, but I want it to make sense within the parameters of the  world you have to buy into for that to happen.  The characters completely  lost me, the love-hate thing with the hero's father was completely  incomprehensible, as were the hero's motivations regarding his actions  toward the heroine.  A definite wall-banger.	2000-05-08

The same can't be said of this book.  It was a stupid story, badly told.	2000-03-08

What an arrogant twit she was.  The ending was completely unbelieveable - she was the cause of his losing everything else he might  have held dear in his life, but it didn't matter because he loved her?  I  thought her responses were incredibly immature and self-centered, and I  felt sorry for James for being so caught up in her.  This is one of the few  books I've read lately where I just intensely disliked one of the main  characters, and the ending didn't resolve anything for me because I didn't  believe it.	2000-02-04

Whoever said it's not a question of IF Maggie Price goes mainstream, but WHEN, is absolutely correct, and I hope it's soon.  This is a great read from a talented writer.  Wonderful hero/heroine, emotional intensity,  excellent writing, believeable situations and responses, and a good,  suspenseful plot to hold it all together. I really enjoyed this book, and I  look forward to finding her previous books, as well as to her future works.   Don't let the fact that this is a category romance keep you from buying,  and enjoying, this book.	2000-02-02

There are great stories, and this is one of them.  Suzanne Brockmann is an accomplished, skillful writer.  I cared about the characters, and the  plot had excellent tension and suspense.  I was glad the two lead  characters found each other, and I was especially glad that John was, with  Mariah's help, finally able to start the healing process from an earlier  emotional trauma.  One of the nicest things about romances is that the  reader isn't left dangling - you know these two people have a happy ending,  and that was very nice to see.  Thank you.	1999-12-21

I liked the heroine, Alessandra.  I thought her transformation from dependent trophy wife to strong, resourceful woman was very good.  For  Harry, the hero, all I kept seeing was Mel Gibson in the first Lethal  Weapon movie.  Undoubtedly that's just me, but it still felt very familiar.   I liked Heart Throb better - Jed's pain and growth touched me more deeply.   Regardless, I look forward to Ms. Brockmann's future efforts.	1999-12-13

It's early Linda Howard, but if you haven't read it, that's better than no Linda Howard.  Similar basic idea as Sandra Brown's book &quot;Adam's Fall.&quot;  At least it's in paperback, so you're not paying  hardcover prices to read it, if you decide to buy.	1999-11-19

I only recently discovered Linda Howard's books, and I've been making a concerted effort to read them all.  For the most part, I've enjoyed them.   However, the &quot;hero&quot; in this book was completely unbelievable.   His last name, &quot;Rutland&quot; was certainly appropriate, since his  solution to their conflict seemed to be &quot;let's have sex, then you'll  feel better about all this.&quot;  I wanted the heroine to kick his  insensitive, self-centered, Neanderthal butt out the door, but even though  her love for him didn't seem to be based on much, it won out anyway.   &quot;Kill and Tell&quot; was much better, as was &quot;A Woman of the  West,&quot; where the hero was also rough and didn't communicate well with  the heroine, but I felt he was better rounded.	1999-10-29
