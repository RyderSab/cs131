The poems are translated from Chinese; one small drawback of the book is that the original Chinse does not appear.  The poems are ostensibly love poems, but they are not love poems in the Western sense; most of the poems talk of a lover who has gone away, not the qualities of the other person which inspire love.<br />The translations are excellent- the translation of &quot;You and I&quot;, for example, is much better than that of Qiu Xiaolong in &quot;Treasury of Chinese Love Poems.&quot;	2004-01-06

The author gives a good overview of Smith's policies and how he negotiated with the British and American governments.  There are also good explanations of the various organizations opposed to white minority rule and how they did and did not get along.<br />If the book has any shortcoming, it is that it was written in 1979, too soon to chart the rise to power of Robert Mugabe.	2003-07-28

Hoyt fails to provide any explanation as to why Tojo developed his beliefs or why he acted as he did.  For example, there is no discussion of Tojo's childhood, and very little information regarding his family life.  While these need not be key to Tojo's biography, such facts might have provided more insight into the man.<br />Hoyt also seems driven to prove that Hirohito was not responsible for the war; in fact, he begins the book commenting on a BBC documentary which argued that Hirohito was a war criminal. Placing this view at the beginning of the book casts doubt on everything that follows, making the reader wonder if the author is attempting to shift blame to Tojo in order to exonerate Hirohito.	2003-07-15

While Oren's style is slightly dry, he tries very hard to be objective, filling the book with information.<br />Unfortunately, a better editor was needed for the book.  As &quot;Travis Bickle&quot; pointed out, there are numerous spelling errors, including consistently spelling Gandhi as &quot;Ghandi.&quot;  The most surprising error, though, is in the photographs- one of the photographs of Moshe Dayan is flipped, so there is one photograph where his patch is over his left eye and another photograph where his patch is over his right eye.	2003-05-16

Too little of the book is spent on Petain's time with the Vichy government, particularly his last two years. The author also covers very little of Petain's trial, and gives no details about his imprisonment.<br />The book is also confusingly organized- the author writes several separate chapters on the same period of time, but examines them from different angles, such as Petain's political views during a particular period of time or his military exploits during that same time. Of course, there are often overlaps between these areas, and writing separate chapters doesn't work well. <br />On the plus side, Griffiths has clearly done a lot of research into Petain for the periods he does write about, and gives good information about Petain's successes during World War I.	2003-01-09

Unfortunately, little of that story comes across in this book.  Ms. Simone shares all sorts of details about her lovers, but very little about her music.  There is almost nothing in the book about her recording sessions or why she sings particular songs the way she does.  While Ms. Simone is very frank about her personal life, I would have liked to have learned more about her music.  The book is also confusing because Ms. Simone will spend many pages on just a few days, and then entire years will be dismissed by a sentence or two.  Ms. Simone's collaborator should have edited the book better and drawn out more music-related stories from her.	2003-01-09

Unfortunately, there are many periods of Haile Selassie's life which receive short shrift- while the 1930s and 1960s/1970s are covered in some detail, the 1940s and 1950s are barely touched on.

The author seems to have been unable to engage in editing.  While Kenton's life is interesting, the biographical information is buried in an avalanche of verbatim news reports, press releases, concert announcements, and reviews.  Was it really necessary to include the complete text of some many concert announcements, including contact telephone numbers?  Do we really need full text reviews of so many concerts?<br />Although some of the quotes from fellow bandmembers are illuminating, it appears that William F. Lee merely wanted to talk to all former bandmembers- some of those quoted only appeared with Kenton a few times.  In addition, many times Lee only lists information, providing little context; there are almost day-by-day accounts of various tours, listing personnel and pieces played.  With all of this information, it is too difficult to follow the thread of the biography.	2002-10-18

That would be an incorrect assumption.  Although the information in the book is good, particularly with regard to wilderness areas near the Grand Canyon, it completely skips such wilderness areas such as Mount Nutt, Wabayuma Peak, Warm Springs, Arrastra Mtn., Table Top, and Upper Burro Creek.  All of these wilderness areas were established in 1990, well before the 1999 publication date.  The lack of information on these wilderness areas makes one wonder how up-to-date the information in the book is.	2002-01-22

The author clearly has some sympathy for the Rajneeshees, but also sees their mistakes and criticizes their antagonistic attitudes towards the people of Oregon.

Instead, this book is basically an autobiography of a former Rajneeshee, who does touch on some of the more infamous actions by the Rajneeshees.  There is precious little detail on the salmonella poisonings in The Dalles, the political posturing in Antelope and other parts of the state, or even the anti-Rajneeshee actions such as the bombing of the Zorba the Buddha restaurant.  Good for those who want to read an autobiography of someone who was in the movement, but hardly a tome about &quot;the rise and fall of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh.&quot;	2001-11-27

Taylor.  Senator Taylor writes in a very down-home style, giving the details of his home life and his various campaigns.  <br />The only criticisms I have of the book are that occasionally Sen. Taylor only gives short vignettes about his life; for example, his description of the 1948 Progressive Party Vice Presidential campaign is limited to his arrest in Birmingham.  Also, he sometimes gives more information than the reader would like about his personal life.<br />Overall, however, this is a fun read about a colorful character.	2001-11-08

Bone	Books	3	0	12	N	N	Adequate overview of politician's life	This book, which incorporates autobiographical writings, provides a good overview of the life of Walter M. Pierce, a governor of Oregon and Congressman from that same state.  Because of the use of the autobiographical writings, there is extremely detailed information about some aspects of Pierce's life that otherwise likely wouldn't have been covered, such as some of the close votes of his early political life.  Unfortunately, the author is unable to explain why Pierce moved to Oregon in the first place or why a progressive like Pierce was also such a racist.  Still, this is a good overview of the life of an important political figure in Oregon history and provides insight into life in Oregon in the early 20th century.  There is also detailed information about the rise of the KKK in the state.	2001-10-22

Ed Cray does a good job explaining the roots of Warren's political beliefs and how he used his political background to exert such a strong influence on the Supreme Court.  <br />Unfortunately, Ed Cray doesn't follow up on at least two issues: Warren's friendships with J. Edgar Hoover and William Knowland.  According to the book, when Warren was in California state government he became such good friends with J. Edgar Hoover that he called Hoover &quot;Jay&quot;- yet it seems hard to imagine that Warren's friendship with Hoover survived some of his court decisions.  Perhaps it did, but Cray doesn't address the issue.  Similarly, it seems that Warren's liberal court decisions would have impacted his friendship with conservative Senator William Knowland, but the book doesn't talk about this, either.	2001-10-18

It covers a wide variety of locations, including Catalina Island, the Santa Monica Mountains, and the San Gabriel Mountains.  Unfortunately, information on some of the hikes is out of date.  Clearly, this is always a problem with books on hiking trails since conditions do change, but it seems that the description of the hike from Vincent Gap to East Fork along the San Gabriel River is particularly out of date.  According to the book, this 14 mile downhill hike will take 9 hours.  Given the extreme deterioration of the trail, it will be difficult for even an experienced hiker to complete it in less than 14 hours.  It seems unlikely that this deterioration has taken place in the short time since the book was published.	2001-10-18

First of all, the authors have clearly not updated information on all of the hikes.  The 2001 edition, for example, gives an extensive description of a hike through Bear Gulch Caves in Pinnacles National Monument.  As anyone who's been to the park knows, these caves have been closed for over four years.  The book's cover claims it's been updated, but, given this glaring error, it's likely that there are other hikes for which it's best to independently verify the information.<br />Second, there are many places in California that the authors skip over.  For example, there are no hikes listed in the Dome Land Wilderness in the Southern Sierra, except for the section of the Pacific Crest Trail that goes there.<br />Third, while the book does list hikes across the state, it doesn't have any trail maps.  While I know that adding trail maps would make the book much longer, it would also make it more useful.  As it is, some of the trail maps are very hard to get a hold of.<br />So, while still worth buying for its coverage of hikes across the state, this book could have been much better.	2001-06-18

While the cover and some of the press for the book may make it appear that the book tackles some of the tough questions regarding international romances, that is not the case. Persons looking for help with the bumps in the road that come with international/intercultural relationships will not find them here, except in a few of the stories where authors share the strategies that worked for them. If there's a psychologist out there who wants to write on this topic, the field is still open.<br />The book also suffers because almost all of the stories are positive. This is perhaps not surprising since people would be less likely to write about their negative experiences since the stories are so personal. Yet, the book gives the impression that any hurdle in an intercultural romance can be overcome, which is not always the case.<br />Finally, there is a disturbing trend in many of the stories in that the women who wrote them (almost all of the stories are written by women) seem to have had to sacrifice themselves to make the relationships work. Many of the stories deal with traditional men, whose families expect women to clean, cook and take care of the kids. In almost every story, the women ditch their careers or education in order to take on this subservient role.	1999-10-18

Unforunately, these skills are definitely not on display in this latest disappointing outing.  Far too many of Korman's recent books (Monday Night Football club series, Chicken Doesn't Skate,  Toilet Paper Tigers and now this new Slapshots series) focus on sports.   While Korman has always worked with cliches and predictable storylines, he  has more than compensated for these shortcomings by writing snappy dialogue  and creating zany situations.  Stars from Mars has very little to  differentiate it from any of Korman's other recent sports books.
