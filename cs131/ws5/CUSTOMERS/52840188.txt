Hunanity is in big trouble as zombies reanimated from the dead as part of a scientific experiment gone wrong, slowly begin their eradication of mankind.  The main (surviving) characters pick up where they left off in this zombie apochalyptic novel by Bram Stoker Award winning author, Brian Keene.  Keene seems to be right at home creating believeable and sympathic characters.<br /><br />The main protagionists (Jim, his son, Danny, Frankie the tough hooker with a heart of gold, and Dan) from \\"The Rising\\" are rescued from a zombie band in New Jersey and whisked to relative safety in the \\"zombie-proof\\" high rise of a billionaire financier with a \\"messiah\\" complex.  Keene introduces a number of memorable characters (including a homeless man named Pig Pen with a cat named \\"God\\") in what is to become the last stronghold of mankind. Our heroes soon begin to wonder if they are in more danger inside with the humans or taking their chances outside with the undead.<br /><br />The gruesome scenes of gore and mayhem are once again present in \\"City of the Dead\\".  Keene even outdoes some of the scenes from the earlier novel.  Elements of humor, however, are also present which give the reader moments of relief.<br /><br />Not for the faint of heart, but better than most sequels, \\"City of the Dead\\" is a very fast read that fans of the zombie genre' will want to add to their collections.	2005-10-05

When scientists open a pipeline from the world of the dead to the living, known as the Void, all hell literally breaks loose.<br /><br />Jim Thurmond is a West Virginia construction worker who, like many Americans, are stunned when they begin seeing the dead start reanimating.  When divorced father, Jim, receives a desperate message for help from his son, Danny, living in New Jersey with his  mother, Jim begins a five-state trek to save his son.<br /><br />Along the way, Keene creates some memorable characters who help Jim with his quest.  There's Martin, the minister whose gentle and calm demeanor helps keep Jim focused.  The two intrepid travellers also meet up with a dynamic ex-hooker named Frankie who has a tremendous will to survive.  Together, they slowly make their way to New Jersey.<br /><br />In his rapid-fire way of writing, Keene creates all kinds of scenarios for the trio to meet up with thousands of zombies.  Much of the book is centered around a military group under the command of a sadistic leader who treats humans no better than the zombies do.  All in all, Keene creates some vividly graphic encounters between humans and zombies that will not appeal to the squeamish.  Be forewarned:  blood and gore flow freely in \\"The Rising\\".<br /><br />Keene also creates a different kind of zombie for his readers.  This zombie is calculating, faster moving, and capable of independent throught.  Zombie animals are even present and play an active role in the novel.<br /><br />The book ends in a cliffhanger, so this reviewer recommends purchasing a copy of the sequel, \\"City of the Dead\\" and having it close because the reader will want to dive right into it after finishing \\"The Rising\\".  \\"The Rising is a terrific zombie novel for those who like the genre'!	2005-09-27

Moore's \\"Fireworks\\" simply expecting an alien invasion novel (as the book cover snippets lead one to believe) will be sorely disappointed because it's not the aliens who star in this novel, but rather the residents of Collier, GA.<br /><br />Amidst the July 4th fireworks celebration, a strange craft appears in the sky and falls to Earth in a lake next the to town.  As the town starts to right itself following the devastation created by the crash, an ultra-secret American military group known only as ONYX arrives on the scene to \\"protect\\" the citizens from the craft.  Well, as every good UFO conspirator-theory believer knows, that kind of \\"protection\\" is just not what the military is really motivated by.  ONYX simply wants to clean up the mess, get the ship spirited way to Area 51 or some other secret base and move out.<br /><br />As the commander of ONYX soon finds out, that simply won't set with these spirited and independent-minded Southerners who react unfavorably to the military occupation.  As relations begin to slowly deteriorate, martial law is declared and all hell breaks loose soon after in this sleepy little town.<br /><br />Moore spends the middle third of the book developing some pretty good characters (with pretty good stories).  The reader gets a chance to connect not only with these folks but with a couple of the key ONYX personnel.  As only a true Southerner could, Moore does an excellent job describing the mindset and determination of these Georgian folks.  He also turns up the heat by graphically describing some of the firefights between the citizens and the military and does a nice job keeping the plot boiling.  One can't help but wonder what role (if any) the aliens will play in the final outcome.  Rather than risk giving away any more plot details, you'll just have to pick up a copy of the book to get that answer.<br /><br />\\"Fireworks\\" is a solid \\"read\\" that will appeal to the fans of Robert McCammon and those who enjoyed the early Dean Koontz novels, such as \\"Strangers\\" and \\"Watchers\\".ammon and those who enjoyed the early Dean Koontz novels, such as \\"Strangers\\" and \\"Watchers\\".	2005-09-18

Stephen Coonts' \\"Saucer\\" is a story about a group of archeologists who stumble across a 140,000 year old flying saucer buried in sandstone as they work in the Sahara Desert.  Once they uncover the saucer, they find that it not only is capable of flight, but that it has become a very hot commodity for a number of groups ranging from the US Air Force to the the Libyian government to the 2nd richest man in the world.<br /><br />One of the archeologist, Rip Cantrell, feels that the saucer is his due to the law of possession and, with the aid of a beautiful former test pilot, Charlotte (Charley) Pine, he gets control of the saucer and flys it back to the US.  From this point, the plot moves quickly as possession of the saucer becomes, \\"now you have it, now you don't\\".  Billionaire Roger Hedrick steals the saucer back from Rip and forces Charley to be his private pilot as he begins a auction to sell it to the country (in this case, China, Japan, Russia and the European nations) with the highest bid.  Hedrick really has no desire to keep the saucer for money, he is totally driven by greed.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back home in the USA, the President and his staff are trying to come up with a way to take the saucer back for reasons of \\"national security\\".  If the reader can suspend their feelings of disbelief, then he or she will enjoy this book.  It is very light reading and not to be taken seriously.  Character development is not as strong as I would have liked, but, the characters are memorable, none the less.  The plot moves at a rapid pace and is action-filled.<br /><br />The ending sets the stage for the sequel entitled, \\"Saucer - The Conquest\\" in which our heroes once again reunite to save the saucer from the hands of the greedy and evil.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED FOR FANS OF MATHEW REILLY, CLIVE CUSSLER, JAMES ROLLINS AND THEIR ILK.	2005-09-05

He did a great job building the plot by adding layer after layer of suspense.  In \\"Seeing Eye\\", he takes a bitter blind man and gives him hope through an experimental operation that permits him to regain his sight through the actual eyes of a black lab.  (As a Black Lab lover, I really enjoyed Ellis' take on this intelligent and loving breed of dog.)  As the blind man (Campbell Knight) slowly begins to re-enter society by seeing through his dog, Shadow, he finds more than he bargained for.  For along with his newly-found sense of sight, he has also picked up a telepathic link with Shadow and possibly other members of Shadow's litter.  One of those litter mates, Max, just happens to be the faithful friend of a seriously deranged kidnapper.  As Campbell finds himself linking closer and closer to Shadow and Max, he discovers that he can \\"see\\" what Max sees as well and discovers what the kidnapper has been doing.<br /><br />Of course, it is a plot that is based in some unbelieveable permises, but it is an excellent story nonetheless. My only criticism is that Ellis didn't spend a lot of time developing the background of the major characters and didn't really explain much about how Campbell was injured.  Minor criticisms, at best!<br /><br />Solid and unrelenting, readers who enjoy a thrilling plot with a number of twists and turns, will enjoy \\"Seeing Eye\\".<br /><br />RECOMMENDED!	2005-08-31

Levy, once declared to be the \\"2nd coming of Stephen King\\", writes in a gripping and visually effective style that brings the reader right down into the action.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the loveless marriage of a socially backward couple.  The ultra-religious husband is totally over-the-top in his beliefs about love, marriage, sex, and the woman's place in the home.  His dowdy wife is left without any love or children from her fundamentalist husband.  Their lives are turned completely upside down when a travelling salesman seeks their help with his car troubles and ends up bedding the wife.  Caught in the act by the husband, the salesman soons finds himself locked in the basement for the rest of his life unless he can find someway to escape.  After years of entrapment, the pitiful salesman becomes more beast than human and the book takes off from there.<br /><br />If you are a fan of intense and violent horror, then you will enjoy \\"The Beast Within\\" and Levy's other great work, \\"Came A Spider\\".  Both are terrific and extremely quick reads.	2005-08-06

While Rollins did a good job setting the stage for the plot, I found myself soon losing interest in the story as I got 100 or so pages into it.<br /><br />Rather than waste your time with another plot synopsis of this book, let me just suffice to say that there are plenty of well-developed characters (a Rollins strength), but his over-wordy style took a book of about 300 pages and turned it into a 500+ page novel.<br /><br />If you're new to Rollins, start with any of his earlier works to get a better feel for his talent (and he is a talented writer).<br /><br />This reviewer's recommendations are in this order:<br /><br />  1.  Subterranean (his first and still best IMHO)<br /><br />  2.  Amazonia<br /><br />  3.  Deep Fathom<br /><br />  4.  Ice Hunt<br /><br />  5.  Excavation<br /><br />  6.

John Tullius' \\"I'd Rather Be a Yankee\\" follows in the footsteps of Donald Honig's \\"Baseball When the Grass was Real\\" and Lawrence Ritter's \\"The Glory of Their Times\\" by letting the players \\"write\\" the book through the reporting of their great stories and reminiscences.  Tullius combines his research with previous works to provide the reader with some great insight about these terrific Yankee teams and players.  All the Yankee greats from the first 3/4th's of the 20th Century are featured in this fast-paced and intriquing book.  Ruth, Gehrig, Dimaggio, Berra, Stengel, Mantle and Jackson are all prominently featured.<br /><br />And while, \\"I'd Rather Be a Yankee\\" probably won't \\"play\\" in Beantown, it will be warmly embraced in the Big Apple and by all Yankee fans.	2005-07-12

Not much.  As a reader of most of Koontz' novels, I was rather intriqued by the premise of alien invasion because this is a subject that has not been broached by the author.  I would compare this reading experience to what I felt after reading medical thriller author Robin Cook's book about alien conquest of the earth, \\"Invasion\\".  While both stories had moments of great suspense and interest, both Cook and Koontz should stick with the areas that they know best, medical thrillers and horror, respectively.<br /><br />Koontz always does a better-than-average job of creating believable characters in fairly unbelievable situations.  That continues to be the case with the lead protagionists in this story, Neil and Molly Sloan, residents of the sleepy community known as Black Lake.  Also present are more of the staple features in a Koontz novel, preternatually insightful dogs (including the ever-present Golden Retriever) and children wise beyond their years.<br /><br />The plot moves very quickly and this is a book that the average reader can finish in a few sittings.  The first portion of the book does have some interesting and creepy moments that will keep you turning the pages.  Unfortunately though, the last half of the book is rather jumbled and turns into a relatively mundane \\"War of the Worlds\\"-type novel.<br /><br />If you're a Koontz completist and want to read all of his works then you will want to dive into \\"The Taking\\".  On the other hand, if you're just looking for a better-than-average alien invasion novel or want to read something great by Koontz, then this reviewer recommends that you look elsewhere.  (For best results, stick with the early Koontz books or anything under his pen name, Leigh Nichols.)	2005-06-16

Even the not-so-avid fan will recognize many of the stars featured in Honig's book.  This list includes Bob Feller, Lefty Grove, Charlie Gehringer, Johnny Mize, Wes Ferrell & Ted Lyons just to name a few.<br /><br />As good as the stories are that the \\"stars\\" tell, it's the other players who relate the best tales.  In particular, Billy Herman's tale about his night as Ernest Hemingway's dinner guest is almost worth the price of the book alone.  Cool Papa Bell's stories of his experiences in the Negro Leagues and \\"barnstorming\\" against Major League players are priceless.  Rip Sewell's explanation of how he began to throw his \\"Eephus pitch\\" is one of the few times that I've seen in print.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Lawrence Ritter's, \\"The Glory of Their Times\\", a book about baseball's very early players, then you will love Honig's book.  These two works are worth a place in every baseball fan's collection!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	2005-06-04

As the officers begin the investigation of the first grisly murder involving a corpse that appears to have been burned from the inside out, it becomes apparent that this will be no routine case.<br /><br />Preston and Child appear to be comfortable in their plotting and characterization of Pendergast, D'Agosta, and another familar character from a previous novel, Police Captain Hayward.  As I read this, I kept wondering which of the authors was writing the Pendergast character and which the D'Agosta character.  I get the feeling that each author has his favorite character in this series.<br /><br />In this reviewer's estimation, \\"Brimstone\\" is not quite as riveting as \\"The Cabinet of Curiosities\\" or \\"Still Life With Crows\\", but does hold it's own.  Part of the problem, is that Pendergast has starting to become too much of a \\"super hero\\" and lost some of his human fralities.  D'Agosta, however, is drawn as a much more sympathetic character with many human emotions.  My only other criticism is the rather annoying subplot containing a schizophenic \\"preacher\\" with a Messiah complex.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the series, then grab a copy of \\"Brimstone\\".  You won't be disappointed.  If you're new to the works of Preston and Child, then I would recommend that you start with their first (and still best in my mind) novel, \\"Relic\\".  It starts the series  off with a bang!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	2005-05-22

Advertised as a cross between \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"Relic\\", \\"Jinn\\" is neither.  It's an uneven thriller that tries too hard to shock its readers.  It reminded me of the film trailers that show the viewer so many of the good parts of the movie that when the person actually goes to see the picture he or she is really let down by the fact that they're already see the best part of the film during the previews.<br /><br />This is a book that I really wanted to work, (and spent a lot of time trying to find) so this reader is more than just a little disappointed.<br /><br />Here's hoping though, that Delaney doesn't give up and keeps working on his trade.  His pacing is plodding and he needs to work on character development, but he does show some promise.  It's just that it took him 400 pages in this novel to get to a pretty good ending.<br /><br />Stick with Preston and Child and visit Delaney at a later time.	2005-05-03

The novel is actually Reilly's first novel, although it was published after a few of his books (Ice Station and Temple) made it big.  Readers of those two books will find \\"Contest\\" every bit as exciting and frenetic as those two earlier offerings.<br /><br />\\"Contest\\" is a story about a \\"battle royale\\" that takes place every millenium or so between representatives of the 7 major populated social systems in the universe.  This time, however, the site of this contest known as \\"The Presidium\\", is the New York City Public Library with its miles of tunnels and booklined aisleways.  In past Presidiums, the human contestant has always been the first to be eliminated.  This time around, Earth is much better represented by a tough-edged, bulldog of a man known as Stephen Swain.  Swain's handicap is that as he is being (unwillingly) transported to take part in The Presidium (the reasons why are more than a little unsubstantiated) his young daughter, is transported with him.<br /><br />Reilly's patterned style of guts, gore and exciting action are all present in this novel as Swain attempts to keep himself and his daughter alive through the contest.  Reilly does a good job introducing the reader to the other competitors and creating some memorable characters in the process.  Introduced along the way for comic relief, is Swain's guide, Selexin, who helps Swain work his way through the roster of competitors while serving as a great sidekick.<br /><br />\\"Contest\\" is an extremely fast reading book and is hard to put down.  In this reviewer's estimation, it's not quite as exciting or polished as the two aforementioned novels, but one needs to remember that this is Reilly's debut novel.<br /><br />Give it a try, especially if you've read anything else by Reilly.  You will find it comical and infantile in his scope at time, but always exciting and fast-moving.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED	2005-03-18

In her 2nd novel, \\"The Breathtaker\\", Alice Blanchard uses the storm chaser craze that is sweeping much of the Midwest and Central US as the centerpiece for an thrilling and unpredictable serial killer novel.  The suspense and excitement climb like a high altitude weather balloon right from the very first page.<br /><br />Sheriff Charlie Grover is the single parent of an adolescent daughter and the law in Promise, Oklahoma.  When Grover discovers that some of the victims of a devastating storm appear to have been killed by something (or someone) other than a tornado, he begins to fear that the weather in Tornado Alley is the least of his concerns.  Add to this, a father/daughter conflict over her social life and you've got one seriously stressed-out Sheriff.<br /><br />Blanchard does a good job with character development as she describes the rocky relationship between Grover and his father Isaac and the burgeoning love affair between Grover and a storm chaser known as Willa.<br /><br />Unlike one of the earlier reviewers, this reviewer did feel that Blanchard did a good job of hiding the identity of the killer. She threw in enough \\"red herrings\\" to keep the average reader guessing.  Also, it's obvious that Blanchard did her homework in the area of storm chasing, because like a good Michael Crichton novel, this book is heavy on terminolgy.  If you don't know much about storm chasing prior to reading this book, it may inspire you to research this phenomenon.<br /><br />It's a great plot premise and an exciting book that will keep you truning pages as fast as a weathervane caught in a F-3.

Protagionist Steve Giroux is trying to put his life back together after a failed marriage and devastating fire to his photgraphy business.  He thinks a trip to Mardi Gras is just the ticket.  Wrong!  He soons find himself persued by a masked reveler who seems to think that Giroux has a photograph that belongs to him.  As Giroux attempts to sort all of this out he meets two lovely women each with a different agenda for him.  What transpires is a race against time to stay alive and figure out the mystery regarding the photograph.<br /><br />As some of the earlier reviewers have noted there are a few unbelievable premises regarding the plot that Pronzini just basically ignores.  Why Giroux just simply doesn't involve the police is explained, but not satisfactorily enough to be feasible in this reviewer's mind.<br /><br />An interesting \\"Twilight Zone-type\\" ending makes the book worth reading to the end.  And at the very least, it IS a very quick read.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED FOR HARD CORE PRONZINI FANS AND MARDI GRAS ATTENDEES	2005-01-23

That excitement is found in \\"Trojan Odyssey\\".  Harkening back to a time when Cussler wrote more involved and complicated plots, \\"Trojan Odyssey\\" has a lot going for it.  The staple characters, Pitt, Al Giordino, Admiral Sandecker, Rudi Gunn, and others are present as well as Dirk Pitt's newly discovered children, Dirk Jr. and Summer.  While the two Pitt children are little more than sidebars in the plot, they are, nonetheless, being groomed by Cussler to replace Dirk Sr. and Al very shortly.<br /><br />The book's plot deals with the plan of a nefarious character (known as Specter) to create a global disaster involving a new ice age.  Specter and his band of Amazon (Druid) female  followers have begun building a tunnel through Nicaragua that will link the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and create a temperature swing in the water temperature that will have a drastic effect on the climate of any land mass north of the 30th parallel.<br /><br />Dirk and Al do their best to foil the plan and and involved in a number of interesting situations along the way.  Cussler actually revives the Pitt franchise somewhat with \\"Trojan Odyssey\\" and leaves his readers wanting more.  Based on the ending, however, this reviewer is not sure that will happen with the Dirk Pitt series, but the ending at least left the door open to more adventures with Dirk and Al.<br /><br />If you're a Dirk Pitt fan, you will want to add this novel to your collection.  It will not disappoint!	2005-01-13

Once again, John Grisham moves away from something that he quite good at (legal thrillers) and into a world where he just not as  comfortable or effective (the human interest story).  \\"Bleachers\\", like \\"A Painted House\\", has nothing to do with the law but much to do about the human condition.  In this story, Grisham takes the reader into a small town in the south where football and and a Lombardi-like football coach is king.<br /><br />Eddie Rake coached his team to countless state titles and had a lasting effect on hundreds of young men's lives, so why is there such a love-hate relationship between the players and the coach?  Grisham develops that theme in \\"Bleachers\\" as he explores the world of high school football and it's effect on the development of young boys.<br /><br />When it becomes known that the coach is dying from cancer his \\"boys\\" begin coming back to pay their last respects.  As they gather, the former players recount their favorite \\"Coach Rake\\" stories and rekindle old friendships.  For one player, All-American Neely Crenshaw, it is an especially difficult reconcilation because of a secret stemming back to the 1987 State Championship game involving Neely and coach Rake.  This is the central theme of the plot.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there's just not enough time in a book of 160+ pages to spend much time on character development and this is probably the book's greatest flaw.  The reader never really gets a chance to explore the relationship between Neely and his former high school sweetheart, nor find out much in detail about any of the other secondary characters.<br /><br />It is a fast read and one that will be enjoyed by football coaches and players and those who like their books short.  Just don't expect a lot.	2004-12-26

I've been a baseball fan for as long as I can remember (40+ years) and have read a number of great baseball books during that span.  \\"The Glory of Their Times\\" certainly ranks with any of them.  Lawrence Ritter traveled the countryside in the 1960's to interview and record the thoughts of some of baseball's greats from the early 20th Century.  His goal was simple:  record the anecdotes and thoughts from these great players before it was too late.  He definitely achieved his goal.<br /><br />Ritter allows the players to do the \\"writing\\" of the book by just holding the microphone in place and editing the volumes of information that he gathered from these former stars.  Most of the names (Waner, Greenberg, Goslin, Wood) will be familar to baseball fans, but even the obscure (Leach, Austin, Lobert, Torpocer) are given their due.  The stories don't just revolve around the baseball careers of these players. Snippets of what life was like in our country between the two great wars can be found here as well.  In that regard, any reader who appreciates history or good human interest stories will enjoy \\"The Glory of Their Times\\" as well.<br /><br />The photos that accompany the book are just as impressive as the stories themselves.  There are a number of pictures of other baseball greats not featured in the book including, Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Christy Mathewson and Honus Wagner, just to name a few.<br /><br />Reading \\"The Glory of Their Times\\" is a great nostalgic trip into baseball's early history and I give it my highest recommendation!<br /><br />Enjoy!	2004-12-23
US	52840188	R8RG3387WD3RD	0843948086	932200627	The Tormentor	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Actually better than expected	I bought this book (prior to reading any of the reviews posted here) because I knew that Bill Pronzini had a pretty good reputation as a thriller novelist.  After reading some of the reviews here, I almost put the book in the back of my \\"to be read\\" collection of paperbacks.  I'm glad that I didn't because this book is actually more entertaining than these reviewers would lead one to believe.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a central character named Dixon \\"Dix\\" Mallory who is trying to get his life back together after losing his wife in a terrible car accident.  Just as he begins to come to grips with his grief, he begins receiving anonymous phone calls from a man purporting to be his wife Katy's former lover.<br /><br />Dix soon finds out that one of his wife's closest friends, Francesca \\"Cecca\\" Bellini, is also receiving prank calls involving the noctural activities of her daughter, Amy.  Cecca and Dix soon begin to collaborate on a plan to find if the calls are connected in any way and what they can do to stop them.<br /><br />Pronzini weaves a pretty good plot from this point as both of the protagonists begin to confront some of their friends regarding the mysterious calls and their subject matter.  The author creates some good characters and throws in quite a few plot twists as the reader tries to unravel who \\"The Tormentor\\" is.<br /><br />This is a \\"quick and painless\\" read for those who enjoy a light \\"who-dun-it\\" of sorts.  While the ending is less satisfying (in this reviewer's humble opinion) it does bring the book to closure while even keeping the door open for a sequel.<br /><br />Even though he's not in the league of King, Koontz, or Laymon, Pronzini does write in a lively fashion that's easy to get into.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED FOR MYSTERY FANS	2004-11-30
US	52840188	R1BXEGO530TGAB	0843950471	807761885	Darkness, Tell Us	Books	3	14	14	N	N	Somewhere on the scale of 3 or 4 for the "horror master".	Let me qualify this review by saying that I have probably read 12-15 Richard Laymon novels so I feel fairly confident that I can give a fair and honest appraisal of his work.  \\"Darkness, Tell Us, while not near the top of my list, is certainly not a bad book and will have many readers turning the pages rapidly.  Laymon sticks to his \\"tried-and-true\\" formula of semi-believeable characters involved in unbelieveable plots with plenty of chills, thrills, and gore thrown in.<br /><br />The setting is a mountainous area far away from civilization that contains a treasure that 6 college students are in search of.  The quest begins after the students begin playing around with a Ouija board at the home of one of their professors during their summer break.  The Ouija board begins to \\"speak\\" to the students and tells them of a great treasure hidden away that no one else knows of.  Now being rather gullable college students, the intrepid adventurers set off on a treasure without telling the professor of their intentions.  As soon as the professor discovers what has happened, she and her former brother-in-law (and now lover) set after the kids.<br /><br />The rest of the book is spent in the mountains as the students search for the treasure.  Along the way, we learn a little more about each of them as Laymon develops their characters. It's these characters that generate the bulk of my criticism for the novel.  There are very few likeable or redeeming qualities present in any of them.  The reader is supposed to feel sympathy for a few of them, I suppose (including the overweight and bitter, Doris, and the sexually-abused heroine, Angela), but this reviewer couldn't muster up much empathy for this group.  The three males are especially lame and uninteresting.  How did this group link up with the extremely unlikeable Keith, and why didn't they knock him off and bury him in the mountains while they had the chance?<br /><br />This criticism of Laymon is unusual because he normally creates a \\"hero\\" that readers can support.  The hero in this book, Howie, is an oversexed, hypocritcal milktoast who can't decide his feelings about his new love, Angela.  One minute he's enthralled and the next he's imagining another girl (Lana) and the professor naked.  Laymon dropped the ball on the characterization of these six which is so unusual because character development is a strength of his writing.<br /><br />Also included in the novel are the ever-present creeps and ghoulish characters.  Both of them in this book are memorable.<br /><br />If you're a Laymon fan and haven't read \\"Darkness, Tell Us\\" yet, them I would certainly recommend that you do so.  It is not a BAD book it's just a little below par for Laymon.  If you're new to Richard Laymon, then I would suggest that you skip this book and look for some of his earlier works.  My recommendations would be:<br /><br />  Beware -  4 stars<br /><br />  The Stake -  4 stars<br /><br />  Bite -  4 stars<br /><br />  Night Show -  4 stars<br /><br />  Island -  4 stars<br /><br />  The Traveling Vampire Show -  5 stars<br /><br />  The Beast Houst series -  5 stars<br /><br />  The Woods Are Dark -  5 stars<br /><br />  Midnight's Lair -  5 stars<br /><br />  Funland (and my personal fav.) -  5 stars<br /><br />And that's just to name a few.

Gregg Hurwitz' latest novel, \\"The Program\\" is a solid and moving follow-up to his 2003 novel, \\"The Kill Clause\\".  Hurwitz reintroduces two great characters from the earlier work, Tim and Dray Rackley.  As the Rackley's continue to struggle to deal with the murder of their daughter and put their own lives back together, Tim is approached by a wealthy film producer who uses his power to get Tim reinstated as a US Marshal in order to secure his help in finding his runaway daughter, Leah.<br /><br />Tim is intrigued by the chance to help another family with a perilous situation involving a daughter and also sees this as a chance to recover his professional life.  As he begins the search for Leah, he finds that she has joined a mind-controlling cult known as The Program.  Under the direction of T.D. Betters, aka, \\"The Teacher\\", The Program is designed to create an army of mindless minions who help Betters bilk wealthy converts out of their fortunes while convincing them that it's for their own good.  Hurwitz has created a great character in \\"The Teacher\\" and  has certainly done his homework regarding cults and their charismatic leaders.<br /><br />Tim realizes that his only hope to rescue Leah is to infiltrate the cult and work from the inside.  As he assumes the identity of a wealthy, but spiritually unhappy millionaire, Tim works his way into The Program and begins the effort to release Leah from its control.  The Teacher and his brood as so good at what they do that even Tim has to struggle to maintain his self-control.  The book really takes off from this point as it rockets to a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />Not to be missed, \\"The Program\\" is a wonderfully written book full of great characters and well-drawn scenes.  Hurwitz just keeps getting better and better!  While not absolutely necessary, I would recommend reading \\"The Kill Clause\\" first so that the reader can get the full background on the Rackley characters.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	2004-10-24
US	52840188	R1KZF5TOU8E1JQ	0451198786	266969050	Darker Than Night	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Average ghost story at best	\\"Darker Than Night\\", the second novel by Bram Stoker Award winner, Owl Goingback, has a pretty average plot and is just lukewarm in the area of chills and thrills.  That being said, this is still a pretty good read.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the boyhood home of horror writer Michael Anthony who leaves New York to reclaim the home when his grandmother passes away.  The townfolk of the rural Missouri community refuse to open their arms to their newest resident because they fear his motives for reclaiming the property.  Many of the residents ridiculed Anthony's grandmother as a lunatic who \\"saw things in the night\\".  Most are suspicious of his motivation and don't want their community to be used as the site for one of his novels.  All Anthony wants is to relocate his family away from the hustle and bustle of New York City.<br /><br />It takes his children a while to warm up to the house and it's surroundings.  And, it's not long until the strange sounds and shapes that Anthony's grandmother spoke of seeing begin to appear to the house's new residents.  As Anthony and his family begin to question their sanity they soon find themselves in a fight for survival against Indian spirits from an underworld world who are using the old home as a portal into this world.<br /><br />Goingback gives the reader great insight on Indian lore and superstitions.  He obviously has done his research in this area and he writes from the heart.  It's just that there's not enough action to really drive the plot and the spirits from the underworld (\\"boogers\\" - and isn't that an unfortunate name) don't have enough \\"character\\" to really put the reader into the plot.<br /><br />Owl Goingback IS a promising young author who will write many good books during his career.  Here's hoping that his later novels will have more suspense plus a deeper plot than he gives us in \\"Darker Than Night\\".<br /><br />My list of Goingback novels in order of appeal are:<br /><br />1)  Crota<br /><br />2)  Evil Whispers<br /><br />3)  Breed<br /><br />4)  Darker Than Night)  Evil Whispers <br />3)  Breed <br />4)  Darker Than Night	2004-09-26

But I digress!<br /><br />As earlier reviewers have noted, \\"Risen\\" reminded me a LOT of \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\".  Like a lot of writers, I'm sure that the book and film adaptation of that 1950's story had an impact on J. Knight.  \\"Risen\\" revolves around a quiet \\"typical American small town\\" called Anderson.  Not much happens there.  So when a distraught and battered wife takes the law into her own hands and murders her abusing husband, it becomes big news.  Big only until it is overshadowed by the return from the dead of her murdered husband.  At first, everyone in town blames the doctor for a botched autopsy.  Even the doctor begins to question his ability and sanity.<br /><br />It's only after a few more murders (taken rather lightly by the populace, by the way) and a few more \\"risings\\" that things really begin to take off with plot.  Knight, as I mentioned before, does do a fine job introducing and developing characters that become somewhat memorable.  He also pours on the gore as he graphically describes the manner in which the townspeople begin to systematically knock each other off \\"so they can be with Seth\\".<br /><br />Knight nevers really gives a full explanation of Seth and his importance to the plot.  Seth appears to be some sort of Anti-Christ that can only reappear with some help from the common folk.  Oh sure, there's a vague connection between an earlier Seth appearance years before, but not much else.<br /><br />Another criticism that I have of Knight's writing style is the annoying way of going through a \\"scene\\" and then repeating the scene once again but through the eyes of another character.  It took me one or two of these \\"scenes\\" to realize what he was doing.  It was repetitious filler and nothing else.<br /><br />The book weighs in at a little over 400 pages, with a plot that could have lasted about 300.  It's definitely a fast read though.  And if the reader is a fan of the Zombie genre', then he or she will probably want to add \\"Risen\\" to their \\"wanna read\\" list.

Once again FBI Special Agent Pendegast is thrust into the middle of a thrilling mystery. And, while Pendergast is surely the star of this novel, the supporting cast of characters help make this truly a memorable story.<br /><br /> That cast includes the following:<br /> 1) Corrie Swanson - rebel teenager who yearns for the love and respect that neither her mother or local townsfolk can give her.<br /> 2) Sheriff Dent Hazen - The &quot;law&quot; in Medicine Creek, Kansas, who would love to leave for the big city but can't because of his sense of duty.<br /> 3) Smit Ludwig - reporter for the local paper who would love to be taken seriously as a newsman and sees the Medicine Creek murders as his last chance for that.<br /> 4) I would be remiss if I didn't mention the Kraus Kaverns of Medicine Creek at this point. Those of you who enjoy spelunking of just visiting caves may never venture into one again after reading this novel. Some of the cave scenes are truly claustrophobic and terrifying!<br /><br /> The plot of &quot;SLWC&quot; has been hashed and re-hashed by the reviewers who have posted before me, so I won't go into much detail regarding it. Here's a very short synopsis though: The good folks of Medicine Bend, Kansas, are shocked when they hear of a ritualist murder that takes place in a cornfield. When a second killing occurs, it appears that the killer could be a resident. Or, is it the curse of dying cavalry officer who watched his men murdered by Indians in the 1840's? It's up to Pendergast to find the answer.<br /><br /> Readers who have enjoyed the earlier works of Preston and Child (i.e., &quot;Relic&quot;, &quot;The Ice Limit&quot;, &quot;Cabinets of Curiosities&quot;, et. al.) will certainly devour &quot;Still Life With Crows&quot;. Preston and Child DO NOT disappoint!<br /><br /> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	2004-08-01

You see, he is the town's executioner who can sniff out &quot;hornets&quot; or those infected by a strange disease that is sweeping the North and South American continents. The disease drives the infected individual mad and gives the carrier the urge to kill any unaffected humans. The town of Sullivan is safe only because of its location and through the gift that Valdiva has. As paranoia begins to take hold of the town's residents, Valdiva begins to consider his options OUTSIDE of Sullivan. One night, as he investigates some strange lights in a neighboring town, he encounters a beautiful girl who is leading a small band of survivalists. Valdiva's decision then becomes to help the small group and risk banishment from Sullivan or settle back in behind the town's safe walls. He chooses the former and thus begins a exciting story about survival and the strength of the human spirit.<br /><br /> Without giving away too many plot details, let me just say that there are a number of memorable encounters with the &quot;hornets&quot; as the small group tries to find a safe place to settle. Clark pulls no punches when it comes to some of the gory and bloody details of battles between the groups - so this is not a book for the squeamish.<br /><br /> My criticisms of the book are minor. I would have rather seen Clark stick to his own &quot;turf&quot; and set the book in England. (He does struggle with American phraselolgy and slang in some parts.) As earlier reviewers have noted, there are a number of unanswered questions as to the origin of the plague, how it's passed, and so on. But these do not detract from the reader's enjoyment of the novel.<br /><br /> Fans of the EOW genre' will certainly enjoy &quot;Stranger&quot;. While it doesn't rank with &quot;The Stand&quot; or Robert McCammon's &quot;Swan Song&quot;, it doesn't fail to deliver. And Clark has left the door open for a sequel in the future.

Hitman Jack Nacht is the best in the business with a body count of 17 contract murders over his career.  When he is hired to &quot;off&quot; a Senator who's getting a little too close to mob affairs, Jake's world is turned upside down when he is shot and paralyzed by a crooked cop who's in on the double cross.  As Jake wallows in self-pity and dispair over his quadrapelegic state, he is befriended by (and falls in love with) his rehabilitation nurse, Angel Deschanel.  After weeks of rehabiliation to no avail, Angel tells Jake of a radical procedure that her uncle, Dr. Joseph Graham, has performed on paralyzed rats that have allowed them to regain full range of motion.  Jake convinces Angel and Graham to try the procedure on him.  Unbeknownst to the medical duo, Jake's motivation for the surgical procedure is to help him regain the use of his limbs so that he can extract his revenge on HIS conspirators.<br />The book is fast-paced and well-plotted.  And, while the surgical procedure used to help Jake regain his movement is more than a little far-fetched, if the reader can overlook that bit of &quot;medical fiction&quot;, he or she will find themselves immersed in a very strong story.<br />Recommended to the fans of Michael Crichton and Robin Cook because of the medical aspects of the book and to the fans of Clive Cussler and Jack DeBrul because of the &quot;heroic&quot; aspect of the book.	2004-07-08

Written in the manner of Michael Crichton's, &quot;Andromeda Strain&quot; and Robin Cook's, &quot;Outbreak&quot;, Hyde's plot revolves around an accident that occurs during the transport of QQ9, a secret biological weapon that the military has been working on.  When townspeople begin to show signs of some sort of terrible epidemic, it's a race between the military and Sheriff Jack Slater and company to see if the disease can be stopped before the military wipes the town off the map.<br />Hyde does a great job with character development and creates a few sidebars for many of the main players in the book.  Sheriff Slater leads the town's battle against the evil military commander, Col. James Wright, who practically has written the &quot;book&quot; on the cover-up and containment of Chemical and Biological &quot;accidents&quot;.  While this battle for survival is going on, divorced-father Slater is also dealing with his rebellious teenage daughter, Karen, and his feelings of affection for Karen's homeroom teacher, Jenny Hale.  Other interesting characters include the town's resident hippie, &quot;Sparrow&quot; Hawke and Dr. Rembrandt Payne, both of whom become reluctant heroes as the book rockets to its exciting and somewhat unexpected conclusion.  Though working with a very interesting plot, Hyde does a great job making the novel character-driven so that the reader really feels a connection with the main players.<br />&quot;Jericho Falls&quot; is a page-turner that will have the reader on the edge of his or her seat and will increase the paranoia that some Americans already have about the intentions of their military and govenmental leaders.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	2004-06-22

One of Laymon's earlier works (even though published late in his career), \\"Blood Games\\" doesn't quite have the edge and sheer terror that most of Laymon's later novels contained.  Oh, don't get me wrong, there's plenty of the Laymon trademarks - great characters, gore, nudity, and sex, but it's just not as polished and fast-paced as his later books.<br />The book deals with the annual reunion of 5 college friends who see themselves as the \\"Daring Young Maids\\".  Each year one of the friends picks the location for the getaway and the girls take it from there.  The choice that is made just happens to be a deserted lodge set in the proverbial \\"out-in-the-middle-of- nowhere\\".  And to sweeten the setting of the plot, the lodge is also the site of a past brutal slaughtering of a large number of guests.  It doesn't take the reader long to see where this story is headed. Laymon, as usual, is great in the area of character development and he certainly does that well in this book.  He uses flashbacks throughout the novel to give the reader a greater depth of the personalities of the 5 friends. I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the character of Batty, a strange old coot who lives near the lodge. This character is one of Laymon's best and oddest creations.<br />As most Laymon fans will attest, it's often been said that the man can't write a bad book.  I would definitely agree with that statement.  But, that being said, if you a new fan of Laymon's, this reviewer would recommend that you start with some of his other books such as \\"Midnight Lair\\", \\"Funland\\", \\"The Beast House\\", \\"Beware\\", or \\"The Woods Are Dark\\", to really get an appreciation of his talent.  You can't go wrong with any of those novels!	2004-06-11

This is the first book I've read by author Edward Levy, but it certainly won't be my last!  (I'm already looking for copies of &quot;The Beast Within&quot; and &quot;The People Next Door&quot;.)  &quot;Came a Spider&quot; is an extremely readable book that flies along at a brisk pace.  The action starts practically from page one and doesn't bog down at any point in the book.<br />The story revolves around an innocent encounter between a young boy and a scientifically-mutated spider.  When the boy is violently attacked by the spider and infused with hundreds of spider eggs, he becomes a human incubator for the millions of arachnids that follow.  Soon the city of Los Angeles and possibly the entire West Coast is threatened to be overrun by these mutant tarantulas.  Levy really pours on the suspense and does a very good job describing the grisly spider attacks on the Californa populace.  Government officials are soon faced with the fact that if they don't take drastic action soon, they may lose the battles with the arachnids.  Does science or the military come to the rescue?

As a dedicated fan of James Patterson, I realized that this was the one book of his that I had not yet read.  Considering myself somewhat of a &quot;completeist&quot; when it comes to authors and musicians, I felt compelled to find a copy even though many, many Amazon reviewers recommended otherwise.  Well, I guess I should have listened to the reviewers!  This is not the James Patterson who wrote the great &quot;Alex Cross&quot; series (or even lesser works like &quot;Thomas Berryman...&quot;, &quot;Virgin&quot;, or &quot;Black Market&quot;).  The character development is almost non-existent and the plot is so jumbled and rambling, it's like a runaway stagecoach.<br />Oh, don't get me wrong, there's plenty of action and numerous gory murders, but the set-up for the book is wafer-thin and it's really hard to fight your way through it.  Like an earlier reviewer stated, I defy any reader to really tell me what the heck is going on through most of this book.<br />If you're a fan of Patterson's, stick with the Cross novels and his other later works.  &quot;Season of the Machete&quot; was obviously a very early effort by Patterson and has about as much substance as some of my last-minute, weekend term papers from college.  It's hard for me to give any Patterson book &quot;one star&quot; but when you compare this novel to his later books, this reviewer cannot do otherwise.<br />Stick to his good stuff and avoid this &quot;Season&quot;!	2004-05-09

Anger, compassion, sympathy, relief are just a few that many readers will experience while reading this short novel.<br />The book revolves around a lonely old man and his dog and how both of their lives are basically destroyed by the immature actions of three teenage boys.  As Avery Ludlow and his dog Red, begin to wrap up an afternoon of fishing, their peaceful time together is disrupted by the appearance of Harold and Danny McCormick and their friend, Pete Daoust.  The boys, it seems, have decided that old Avery may just be an easy \\"mark\\" way out in the middle of nowhere and decide to rob him. After finding out that Avery has little or no money, Danny McCormick (the obvious leader of the boys) decides that the group needs to insure that Avery won't say anything about the failed robbery, so out of spite and intimidation, Danny shoots and kills Red.<br />What the boys didn't bank on, of course, is the determination and vengence of this grizzled Korean War veteran and the love that he had for his only friend.  As Avery (or Av, as he is referred to throughout the bulk of the book) sorts out HIS emotions, he sets upon a course of action to right this wrong.  When he finds out who the boys are and contacts their parents, he is rudely rebuffed and called a liar.  The parents refuse to believe that their little angels could have committed such a heinous crime.<br />Well, they picked the wrong guy to mess with!<br />Ketchum does a great job of building the suspense and even throws in a twist or two.  Will Avery get the satisfaction of having the boys dealt with by the authorities or their parents or will he have to take matters into his own hands?  The reader will have to find out for his or herself.<br />The book is a VERY quick read because of its length and also due to the way that Ketchum causes the prose to jump off the book.  Just prepare for an emotional roller coaster as you churn through the book to the finish.  Also included in the August 2002 Leisure Books printing of this novel is the novella, \\"The Passenger\\".  Very good in it's own right.  Enjoy!ook.  Just prepare for an emotional roller coaster as you churn through the book to the finish.

American Science Fiction Movies of the Fifties, Vol. 1: 1950-1957	Books	5	15	16	N	N	Like taking a class in &quot;Classic Sci Fi Movies&quot;	And I mean that in a good way because if you're a B-movie science fiction fan, this will be your favorite &quot;class&quot;.  Bill Warren's magnus opus, &quot;Keep Watching the Skies&quot; is THE definite reference book on the science fiction movies made in the 1950's and into the early '60s.  It is an inexhaustive review of every good, bad, and ugly movie from those two decades.  Extensive research is at the heart of the book. This is an author who is seriously in love with this genre'.  Warren has gleaned numerous unknown tidbits about the actors, sets, budgets, etc. from these great, but often underappreciated, B-movies.<br />Classic science fiction movie fans will be totally absorbed by the book.  Best read in small chunks, it's almost impossible to put down!  Warren not only provides an interesting and honest narrative of each of the films, but adds a chonological list of when the films were distributed and gives a separate synopsis of the films' plots, actors, directors, etc., in a different section of the book.  A great index is available and can be of tremendous help when you're watching a midnight sci fi movie fest and can't remember that particular actor's name.<br />By all means, buy the 1997 printing of the book because it contains both volumes (1950-57 and 1958-62).  It's a steal at any price.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	2004-02-07

I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I picked up a copy of Edward Lee's \\"City Infernal\\".  I had never read anything by the gentleman and knew little of him.  From other reviews, I surmised that he was of the same ilk as Richard Laymon, Simon Clark, Tom Piccarilli and others, but little did I know that his \\"over-the-top\\" brand of horror would put them to shame.  Lee goes full throttle in this story which, in a way, is his version of \\"Dante's Inferno\\".<br />The story revolves around Cassie Heydon, a gothic teenager who is filled with guilt over the suicide of her twin sister, Lissa -  a suicide that Cassie feels she drove her sister to over a misunderstanding involving Cassie and Lissa's boyfriend.  When Cassie's father decides that the best thing to her clear his daughter's mind and conscience is to move them from the city to the country, they unknowingly take up residence in the town's haunted house.  As Cassie explores her new digs she encounters a trio of ghostly characters that only she can see.  The trio, Xeke, Via, & Hush, are actually living souls who, because of their misdeeds on earth, have been sent to Hell for eternity.  Only Cassie can see them because the trio tells her that she is an Etheress - an ultra-powerful being who is capable of performing great feats of telekinesis and other mental powers if she were to visit Hell.  Visit Hell?  \\"Hell yes\\" she's told, that is, if she ever wants to reconcile with her sister.  Cassie decides to follow the trio into Hell and attempt to make contact with her dead twin.<br />From this point, Lee takes the reader on a tour of Hell that can't be adequately be described by this reviewer and instead should only be experienced by the reader.  Let's just say that that the reader should refrain from eating lunch or dinner while reading this novel.  Lee's imagination is boundless as he describes in graphic detail what Hell must look like.  Portrayed as a gigantic city under the rule of Satan, it lives and breaths like any other city except that it's occupants are damned to live there for eternity.<br />Short on character development, don't expect a deep plot in \\"City Infernal\\".  What the reader will get instead is a jolting, page-turning story that has a number of twists and turns along the way.  Any of the fans of the aforementioned authors should enjoy this wild ride and won't go away dissatisfied with the novel.

As a big fan of the works of Lincoln Child and Doug Preston, I certainly was looking forward to reading Child's first solo attempt, &quot;Utopia&quot;.  I was not disappointed!  It was a solid, entertaining novel from the first to the last page.  Child shows off his great imagination by taking the reader to a 21st Century theme park filled with &quot;smart&quot; robots, holographic images, and good, old-fashioned fun.<br />The plot revolves around the designer of the said robots, Andrew Warne, who is called to the theme park (Utopia) to figure out why some of the park's robots are acting strangely.  The romantic interest of the story comes into play because the executive director of the park is his former lover, Sarah Boatwright.  Warne's arrival coincides with the start of a mastermind plot to steal millions from the park by disrupting the rides and terrorizing the guests.  Heading up this scheme is a great character known (rather unimaginably) as John Doe.  For the bulk of the novel, John Doe has Sarah, Warne and the park officials on their heels trying to keep him from creating a mass panic.  My favorite character in the book, Angus Poole, is introduced at this point as a mysterious &quot;federal agent-wannabe&quot; who arrives at the nick of time to save the park.  (Or does he?)<br />Filled with a couple of great plot twists, you'll soon find yourself flying through the book as you reach the satisfying ending.  Rarely, do I wish that a book would go on and on, but I certainly did with this one.  It was a pleasure to read and will be a big hit with the fans of Preston and Child.  It should also appeal to those who enjoy the works of Michael Crichton because of it's technical nature.<br />This is a book crying out for a screenplay, so I would not be surprised to see it as a major summer blockbuster in a year or two.  But, before that happens, do yourself a favor and grab a copy of &quot;Utopia&quot; and enjoy a great story.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	2004-01-14

In his debut novel, Michael Laimo, has created a bizarre world filled with the unexplained murders of young males in New York City.  As lead protagonist, Detective Frank Ballaro, and his friend and former partner, Police Captain Hector Rodrequez, try and sort out the reason(s) for these grisly murders, they soon find themselves with clues that lead them to believe that the killers might not be from this planet.  The plot thickens when Frank's only child, daughter Jaime, is kidnapped by one of the many &quot;bald men with sunglasses&quot; that are under the control of the aliens.<br />Sounds pretty bizarre doesn't it?  Laimo somehow tries it all together at the end of the book, but between a few great opening pages and the expected climax, there's a lot of repetition and downtime throughout the body of the novel.  Oh, don't get me wrong, it's a quick read and there's plenty of violence and descriptive scenes of blood and gore, it's just that there's not enough character development and plot setting for my liking.  I would have liked to know more about the Ballaro family and certainly would have liked a little more about why the aliens landed in NYC in the first place.<br />For a first novel, however, it's not bad.  If I could, I'd give it 2 and one-half stars, but that's not part of the Amazon grading system.  Fans of Richard Laymon, David Lozell Martin, Rex Miller, and Michael Slade will probably enjoy &quot;Atmosphere&quot;, they just shouldn't go into it with a lot of expectations.	2004-01-01

The book takes off from page 1 with a plot that's so well crafted the reader will practically burn his or her fingers turning pages so fast!<br />The story centers around a tight Presidential race between the incumbent, Zach Herney and his ethics-challenged rival, Sen. Sedgewick Sexton.  As Sexton gains ground in the polls, it appears to Herney and his staff that only a miracle can keep him in office.  That miracle appears in the form of a spectacular discovery that NASA makes in the Arctic.  A discovery that could change the course of mankind forever.  To give this find credibility, Pres. Herney calls upon the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) to verify the discovery before he goes public with it.  As luck (or good writing) would have it, the NRO agent assigned to the verification process is Rachel Sexton, daughter of Sen. Sexton.  A daughter who hasn't spoken with her ambition-blinded father since her mother died.<br />When Rachel travels to Arctic to help with the verification process, she suddenly finds that there may be reason to believe that NASA's discovery is part of a government conspiracy of the highest level.  As she and scientists, Michael Toland and Corky Marlinson, get too close to the real truth, they quickly find themselves scrambling to stay alive in the desolate Arctic locale.<br />Filled with memorable characters and great plot twists, the reader with be enthralled with \\"Deception Point\\"!  Just when I thought I had a pretty good grasp of \\"whodunit\\", Brown would pull the plot rug out from under my legs.  Unlike a lot of the fiction that I've read, there's a lot of \\"gray\\" in many of the characters in this book.  I found that to be refreshing and actually increased the credibility of the book.<br />This is the first book that I've read by Dan Brown.

I think I've read everything that Michael Crichton has written and I've got to say that the man's got a great imagination!  In &quot;Timeline&quot;, he gets to show off that great imagination (while taking a few moments of &quot;poetic license&quot; to make the plot work.  Crichton fans who enjoyed &quot;Andromeda Strain&quot; and the movie &quot;Westworld&quot; (Crichton did the screenplay) will certainly enjoy this book.<br />Without rehashing the plot (ethically-challenged billionaire businessman creates device that allows for time travel which has to be used by his team of scientists to rescue an earlier time-traveller), let me suffice to say that this book does not lack for action.  The pace is terrific and there's plenty of great visualizations that Crichton provides of Medieval Europe.  Check out the bibliography at the end of the book to get a sense of the research that Crichton put into this novel to make it realistic for the reader.  Fantastic!<br />As some of the earlier reviewers pointed out, this book does &quot;read&quot; like a screenplay.  So?  It's great action and and allows the reader to feel like he or she is really there in the 1300's.  I found myself so totally engrossed during parts of the book that I flew through it.  And you will too if you are a Crichton fan.  So grab a copy of the book before the movie comes out and make your own decision.  Either way, you'll find &quot;Timeline&quot; and enjoyable experience and some great escapism!<br />RECOMMENDED	2003-11-23
US	52840188	R2GETNSIHMAFSR	0312955154	389827889	Direct Descendant	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Solid and entertaining escapism	I should first announce that I believe that Charles Wilson is a vastly underrated author.  It's too bad that more readers don't know about him because he's just as good as Michael Crichton and better than Robin Cook.  Having read two of his other books, &quot;When We First Deceive&quot; and &quot;Nightwatcher&quot;, I had a pretty good idea what I was getting when I picked up a copy of &quot;Direct Descendant&quot;.<br />Wilson is a great plot creator and he really shows his stuff in this story.  &quot;DD&quot; is the tale of the 500,000 year-old remains of &quot;The Ancient Man&quot; that are uncovered by paleontologist Cameron Malone that end up becoming much more than anyone expects.  When a rival scientist steals the preserved sperm from the Ancient Man to impregnate a host &quot;mother&quot;, he soon realizes that he has put something in motion that he won't be able to control. Ok, so it's a little far-fetched, but Wilson makes it work and creates a page-turning frenzy for the reader.<br />Wilson also does a great job creating some memorable characters.  (Memorable enough, that I think most readers would love to see a sequel of some sort.)  He mixes in just enough techno-jargon to show off his research and make the plot seem realistic.<br />If you enjoy this novel, be sure to try the aforementioned others.  You won't be disappointed!<br />RECOMMENDED	2003-11-03

Reading \\"FBM\\" is not unlike eating a bag of potato chips, satisfying, at least in the short haul, but filled with empty calories.<br />Fans of the Cross series will definitely want to read this book, if for no other reason, than to stay current with the lives of Cross, his kids, Nana Mama, Sampson and Cross's new flame, Jamilla.  As usual, the mega-short chapters are present and like all of the other Cross novels, the reader will fly through this one as well.<br />The plot revolves around three reactionary, ex-Vietnam veterans who have been on a serial killing spree for a number of years.  When the \\"Three Blind Mice\\", as they call themselves, frame a good friend of John Sampson for murder, both Cross and Sampson try and come to the rescue.  As our protagionists get ever closer to chopping off the tails of the \\"mice\\", Patterson throws in a few plot twists that strengthen the story.  Cross's arch-enemy, Kyle Craig, even makes a cameo appearance.  Along the way, Cross agonizes over a possible job change and dealing with his ever-deepening relationship with Jamilla.<br />By all means don't think that I am dissatisfied with \\"FBM\\".  It's just after this 8th installment, I'm beginning to wonder if Patterson himself isn't becoming a little bored with the Cross franchise.  I hold great hope for the next installment of the series, \\"The Big Bad Wolf\\" which is due out sometime in the Fall of 2003.  Let's hope that Patterson instills some new life in the Cross series and \\"The Big Bad Wolf\\" gets on my \\"can't wait to read it\\" list!<br />RECOMMENDED (especially to \\"completists\\" of the Alex Cross series)	2003-10-24

David, creates an apocalyptic view of present-day Earth overrun by dinosaurs brought to the future through a time warp.  Author David gets to show off his knowledge of dinosaurs by making them come to life for the reader.  Apatosauri, Pteridacti, T-Rexs, you name it...they're all in this book.  It's great fun for those who have an interest in that \\"world\\".<br />Along the way, though, there's a pretty good story here as well.  David weaves a number of different sub-plots involving a variety of characters as they cope with this world \\"gone upside down\\".  The human element (as these folks struggle to explain what has happened and how they will survive) is the real engine that drives this novel.  As one reviewer already noted, it was fairly easy to keep the sub-plots separate from one another.  To help in that department, David has included a \\"cast of characters\\" page at the front of the novel that the reader can refer to from time to time.<br />While not on the same plane as Stephen King's \\"The Stand\\" or Robert McCammon's \\"Swan Song\\", this novel is pretty good book.  It's quick to read and open-ended enough at the conclusion to make the reader think that a sequel could be in the offing.  Definitely recommended for Jurassic Park fans and those who enjoy books of the apocalyptic genre'.	2003-10-19

Not too deep, it's an well-researched debut novel by Walt Becker with a large number of cited resources in the back of the book.<br />Becker has created some memorable lead characters, Jack and Samantha, who stumble on to what could be the most important discovery in the history of the world.  The &quot;link&quot; that they discover in the jungles of Mali may not just change Darwin's Theory of Evolution, but the future of mankind, as well.<br />Without giving away important plot details, let me suffice to say that the intrepid aforementioned scientists end up battling not only a greedy entrepreneur for their discovery, but the US Govenment as well.  There's a sufficient amount of action and romance to appeal to a wide range of readers.  &quot;Link&quot; is entertaining without becoming cheesy, yet fantastic enough to keep the reader guessing what might be coming around the next bend.<br />It's pure escapism and good for a few hours of enjoyment.<br />RECOMMENDED	2003-09-23

Not usually given to superlatives, let me start this review by stating that Gregg Hurwitz' 4th novel, \\"The Kill Clause\\" is the best book that I've read in the past year!  The plot takes off like a rocket from page one and never loses steam.<br />The story revolves around the brutal murder of the young daughter of law enforcement officers, Tim and Dray Rackley.  As the Rackley's deal with a parent's greatest nightmare, things become even worse when the alleged murdered is set free because of a violation of his 4th Amendment rights during his arrest.  Tim is so distraught over this turn of events, that he considers taking the law into his own hands.  As he comtemplates this action, Tim is approached by an unusual band of vigilantes known as The Commission.  Each member of The Commission has suffered a great personal loss along the lines of the Rackleys.  And, in each of their cases as well, the perpetator has gone free because of some legal technicality.<br />Without giving away too much of the plot let me just say that the anguish that Tim feels over the loss of his daughter pales in comparison to the guilt that he begins to feel as he becomes the hit man for The Commission.  This very human story tests the depths of many emotions, especially the relationship that a husband and wife have to deal with after a loss of this magnitude.<br />Hurwitz has done another outstanding job with his character development in this novel.  The members of The Commission are unique in their own fashion and extremely interesting.  There were a number of scenes throughout the book that I read at a blur because the action was so intense.  Numerous graphic scenes definitely make this powerful book one that is not for the faint of heart.<br />Bravo to Mr. Hurwitz on his latest creation and attention all Hollywood execs:  This would make a dynamite film!  The screen play is practically written already.  I can't wait to see what Hurwitz writes next!<br />HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!	2003-09-07

The book starts out a little slowly as Harriman sets the plot up, but by page 75 you'll be hooked and will find yourself pouring through the book.  The characters are well fleshed-out and each have a \\"story\\" to tell.<br />Harriman has done impressive research as evidenced by his detailed explanations of the workings of the Pentagon (a great site for a novel, by the way) and the Nazi secret organization known as the Abwehr. Transitions back and forth from each plot locale are done seamlessly!<br />The plot revolves around grisly deaths of Pentagon workers that begin to mount up with no apparent explanation.  As Pentagon \\"Mayor\\" Ed Jeffers tries to find reasons for the deaths, he is aided by herpetologist (and soon to become romantic interest) Dr. Andrea Deluca and Navy SEALS under the command of Lt. Terrill Hodge.  As the trio begin to unravel the clues leading to the deaths of the Pentagon workers, they find a killer they're unprepared to deal with - a mutant amphibian who's origin may have stemmed from secret experiments dating back to Nazi Germany of the early 1940's.<br />Without giving away any plot details, let me just say that Harriman has taking a fairly unbelievable concept and pulled it off.  The hard-edged Hodge is a perfect compliment to the self-conscious Jeffers character and both play well off the Dr. Deluca character.  There's plenty of chills and thrills throughout the book and Harriman knows how to pile up the suspense.  A fairly satisfying ending also leaves the door open for a sequel that many readers will demand after finishing the book.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (especially for Crichton and Preston & Child fans)	2003-08-24

James Rollins, author of other great action novels such as, \\"Subterranean\\" and \\"Excavation\\", has done it again with \\"Amazonia\\".  This novel grabs you right from the start and before you know it, you're 50 pages into it.<br />The plot revolves around the search for a hidden Amazon tribe that may hold the secret to cellular regeneration.  Numerous sub-plots also exist in this novel.  A son looks for his father who disappeared years before while searching for the secret tribe.  Evil representatives of a pharmaceutical firm attempt to find the secret tribe and their herbal medicines for their own profitable gain - and will stop at nothing to succeed. And the secret to healing a devastating plaque that is sweeping the U.S. is somewhere in the Amazon jungle.<br />Rollins does a great job keeping all of the \\"potboilers\\" simmering throughout the book.  The action is fierce and frenetic throughout. You should also prepare yourself for your squeamish moments as Rollins describes some grisly situations involving the search for the tribe.  The Army Rangers sent to protect the expedition seem to get killed out faster than the crew men in the red shirts from the old Star Trek program.  Behind these gory demises are some fantastic creatures, notably man-eating frogs, mutated piranhas, giant locusts, and hundred-foot caiman.  OK, so you have to suspend your powers of disbelief a little!<br />Some memorable characters abound in this novel.  Nathan Rand, the sympathetic son who still hopes to find his father.  Manny and his pet jaguar, Tor-Tor, who aid in the search for the tribe and Professor Kouwe, a spiritualist, linguist, and healer who provides guidance to the group and young Nathan.<br />If you're a fan of any of the Preston/Child or Matthew Reilly novels, then \\"Amazonia\\" is for you.  It's an extremely quick-reading book that's hard to put down!	2003-08-11

Ivy Leaguer Gregg Hurwitz has created a terrific group of characters in his psychological thriller, \\"The Tower\\".  The story takes off like a rocket from the first page as Hurwitz introduces us to a cast of prisoners like no other.  This rogue's gallery is imprisoned in an ultra-secure facility just across the bay from San Francisco called The Tower.  The Tower makes Alcatraz look like a county lock-up.  Hurwitz lets his imagination run wild as he describes in graphic detail of the many features that The Tower uses to keep these societal misfits away from the population.  Like one other reviewer mentioned, Hurwitz just doesn't spend enough time telling the reader about the prison.  I wanted to know more!<br />The story revolves around the escape of serial killer, Allander Atlasia and his pursuer, Jade Marlow, a.k.a. \\"The Tracker\\".  Atlasia wants to take out the \\"ultimate revenge\\" against his parents and will stop at nothing to achieve that goal.  Both Atlasia and Marlow are vividly drawn by Hurwitz and are bigger than life.  The Marlow character reminded me of Clint Eastwood from the \\"Dirty Harry\\" days.  As Hurwitz brings these characters to life I think he intentionally shows the reader that in reality they are not all that different from one another after all. (The anti-hero vs. the pyschopath)  Hurwitz delves deeply into man's psyche as he presents the reader with these two seriously warped human beings.  Great stuff, though!<br />Without giving away any important plot scenes, let me just say that this is a book that will keep the reader guessing and has more than a few twists and turns.  It is a real page-turner that is filled with graphic violence.  Not for the squeamish!<br />I look forward to reading other Hurwitz novels.  If they are anything like \\"The Tower\\", then he will become one of the new stars on the horizon.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	2003-07-27

Take a couple of world-renowned paleontologists, mixed with a little wild west action and the discovery that a couple of aliens have come to earth with the express desire to take back dinosaur bones to their home planet for &quot;reanimation&quot; and you've got the premise to &quot;Bone Wars&quot;.<br />When rival paleontologists, O. C. Marsh and Edward Cope, find themselves in direct competition for what few dinosaur bones they can find in Montana during the mid-1870's, imagine their amazement (and this reader's) when they discover that the two other scientists who are competing for fossils and bones as well may actually be visitors from another world.  It seems these &quot;foreign&quot; scientists have technology far beyond anything they have seen.  This technology both mystifies and terrifies the paleontologists, so Marsh and Cope soon realize that if they're going to succeed in keeping the bones here on earth, they will need reinforcements.  To add to an already bizarre plot, the reinforcements come in the shape of the Sioux Indians under the direction of Sitting Bull himself.<br />To paraphrase Yogi Berra, if this all sounds just a little too weird for your tastes, then it probably is!  I'm sure that the &quot;dinosaur crowd&quot; will enjoy it, even though there are not enough references to dinosaurs in the book for my liking.  The &quot;Western crowd&quot; should like it because author Brett Davis does a creditable job taking the reader back to the world of 1870 America.  And those who like stories about Indians will enjoy the scenes that include the Sioux and Crow tribes.  There's even a little love interest in the book for the romantic in all of us!<br />Oh, it's a descent story and a quick enough &quot;read&quot;, it's just that &quot;Bone Wars&quot; is not the type of novel that the average reader will want to dig up and put above their fireplace.<br />RECOMMENDED (to the groups mentioned above)	2003-07-13

Clark (who has yet to write even a mediocre book, in my opinion) has put together a wonderful plot with interesting characters.  The book revolves around the return of Dr. David Leppington to his birthplace, Leppington, England.  As he begins to interact with some of the locals at the hotel of the mysterious Electra Charnwood and finds out more about his former hometown, he begins to recollect some long-buried memories about his past. Shortly after, David meets with his uncle George who fills him in on his family's dark past and most terrible secrets.  Secrets that contain stories about their family's interaction with Norse gods and a hidden vampire army waiting to be led toward world domination by a direct descendant of the Leppington family.  That family member, course, is David Leppington.<br />When David refuses to lead the vampire army, all hell literally breaks loose.  Local townspeople begins to mysteriously disappear at night and soon the vampires turn their sights on eliminating David and new band of friends.  One of these friends, Jack Black, is one of the more novel characters that I've seen in recent years.  He is portrayed as a psychopath with a heart of gold.  And, while it's a little more than confusing as to why he changes his \\"stripes\\" in mid-book to become a hero, he is nonetheless an interesting part of the novel.<br />A warning should be prominently displayed to the reader at this point in the review:  If you are the squeamish-type, you may want to avoid this book!...Don't say that you haven't been warned.<br />I continue to be impressed with the writing of Simon Clark!  He's created a memorable novel in \\"Vampyrrhic\\".  And evidently, he liked the work as well because a sequel to this book is in the works.  If you liked \\"Salem's Lot\\" then you'll love \\"Vampyrrhic\\".  Just make sure that you've got a lot of garlic around when you read it!!<br />STRONGLY RECOMMENDED	2003-06-30

Disappointment is too mild a word for what I felt after reading James Herbert's &quot;The Fog&quot;.  I know that many reviewers before me have raved about this &quot;classic&quot; horror novel, but in my humble opinion, it left me wondering if I had read the wrong novel.  It's too bad because I really wanted this book to &quot;work&quot;.<br />I think part of my disappointment stemmed from the fact that most of the characters were either uninteresting or poorly fleshed out.  And the plot...while extremely promising in the beginning, basically plodded along and collapsed at the finish.<br />Oh, there's plenty of gore and gruesome scenes in the book, but not enough to save a basically weak effort by one of the great horror novelists.<br />Now I know not everyone is going to agree with my opinion, but after reading hundreds of horror novels over the years, I guess I have a right to it!  Sorry Mr. Herbert!<br />IMHO, for a better use of your time and money, go out and rent John Carpenter's loose version of &quot;The Fog&quot;.  It's a scare-a-minute thrill-fest that, if nothing else, will hold your interest because of Jamie Lee Curtis and Adrienne Barbeau.	2003-06-19

While \\"Area 7\\" stands perfectly alone as an extremely intense military novel, it works even better as a companion piece to Matt Reilly's earlier novel, \\"Ice Station\\". Both of the survivors from Capt. \\"Scarecrow\\" Schofield's Marine unit from \\"Ice Station\\" days (Sgt. \\"Fox\\" Gant and Sgt. \\"Mother\\" Newman) are present for the action that takes place at Area 7.<br />In this novel, Schofield has his Marine unit on hand to help protect the President during his visit to a secret military base hidden away in Utah and known only as Area 7. What the President, his Secret Service and the Marines don't realize until too late is that Area 7 just happens to be the home base for a secret plot to overthrow the government. This uprising is led by a courtmartialed Air Force officer who calls himself \\"Caesar\\" and heads up a radical Air Force group known as \\"The Brotherhood\\". Schofield and his unit soon find themselves in the fight of their lives.<br />What takes place during the next 300+ pages is totally unbelievable (just like the the plots from Reilly's other two books) but filled with action and zooms along at a frenetic pace. Not that there's anything wrong with that - it's just that it's almost comic-bookish in that sense. One can almost visualize the \\"Bam\\", \\"Oof\\", and \\"Kaboom\\" dialogue balloons used so effectively by the old Batman television show in the background of some of Reilly's scenes. And of course, as found in Reilly's other novels, there's plenty of blood flowing and more dead bodies than a Schwarzenegger movie. Descriptions of real (and unreal) military hardware abound to impress the techo-geek in all of us! If the reader will just suspend his or her powers of disbelief for a while then he or she will find \\"Area 7\\" an enjoyable experience.<br />The only reason that I gave \\"Area 7\\" four stars was because there was a little too much similarity to \\"Ice Station\\" for my liking. I would have liked to have seen some new ground covered and a few more characters developed. That probably won't be a problem for most Reilly fans, and especially shouldn't be an issue if this is the first book by Reilly that the reader tries.<br />RECOMMENDEDprobably won't be a problem for most Reilly fans, and especially shouldn't be an issue if this is the first book by Reilly that the reader tries.<br />RECOMMENDED	2003-05-31

And, while I can't say that this is one of the top 500 books that I've read, it passes the mark.  As one would guess from the title, this is a story about earthquakes.  It particular, the &quot;Mother of All Earthquakes&quot; that being the one that seismologists have been predicting for years, the quake along the New Madrid Fault.<br />I've been somewhat interested in this topic for some time now since I live in an area that might be affected by such a quake.  And as people in this area know, the New Madrid Quake may be even more devastating that the San Francisco and Alaskan quakes that created such widespread damage in the last 100 years.  And, if you too live along this faultline, you may not want to read this book because if Hernon is right about &quot;the big one&quot; you might choose to find a new address.<br />Hernon has done a good job for the most part with his research and in some cases, the book reads like something out of Michael Crichton.  Seriously limited though, is Hernon's character development and any &quot;connection&quot; that the reader might have with these characters.  They're just not very interesting.  I don't know if that flaw is by design or not, because the real star of the story, of course, is the quake or quakes.<br />The book has suspenseful moments and even includes a little sabotage and deceit along the way.  It's a very quick read and good for passing the time.  In reality, though, this book will probably have only limited appeal to those readers who don't live in this area.<br />For better books about the New Madrid faultline and the coming quake, I'd suggest &quot;The Rift&quot; by Walter Williams and &quot;The New Madrid Run&quot; by Michael Reisig (a superior, yet too short book, from an outstanding storyteller).	2003-05-11

An overuse of stereotypical characters dooms the plot from the start.  Almost to the point where you find yourself \\"rooting\\" for the building!<br />The fireworks begin as the building reaches the last stage of construction and becomes ready to hand off to its new owners. Strange occurances begin to take place and members of the architectural firm find themselves trapped in the building and unable to leave.  This is not your usual \\"serial-killer type novel\\" and for that I'll give Kerr credit, but IMHO it was too fantastic to be believable.  A solid, strong human villain would have made the novel more effective.<br />There's plenty of gratuitous sex and violence to satisfy the \\"thriller\\" audience, but not enough action to entertain most readers.  It's a shame because I really wanted this book to \\"work\\".<br />This one is for dedicated, \\"completist\\" fans of Philip Kerr only.  Other readers who are interesting in reading \\"The Grid\\" should purchase a very cheap, used copy or check it out at the library.	2003-04-02

I kept \\"waiting\\" for this book to pick up the steam that I thought it would, but it just never materialized.  On top of all that, this was one of the most depressing books I've read in recent memory.  The main character, Artie, may make my all-time top 10 \\"most pathetic losers\\" list.  He and other members of \\"The Suicide Club\\" should have done that dirty deed about 50 pages into the book and saved me having to read the last 300 pages.<br />I'm sorry, because this could have made a great story.  I kept thinking that Preston & Child or James Rollins could have taken this premise and really done something with it.  Unfortunately, Frank Robinson could not.  So, my advice is, don't be fooled by the back cover.  What sounds like a great story is mostly dribble and depressingly boring.  Stick to the aformentioned Preston & Child, Rollins and John Darton for some terrific books along this storyline.<br />NOT RECOMMENDED	2003-04-02

It's this &quot;staying power&quot; that is one of the criterion that I use to judge an outstanding horror novel.  Long after you have read it, &quot;Darkness Demands&quot; will remain in your memory.  It's that good!<br />Life begins to look good for novelist John Newton as he finally starts to make it good as a novelist.  Good, that is, until he (along with other members of his town) begin to receive cryptic, almost comical, messages left on their doorsteps asking that candy bars and pints of beer be left in the creepy old cemetary just outside of town.  No one seems to know who or why these messages are being left until they begin to talk to some of the town's older residents who let them is on the town's dirty little secret.  A secret so perverse that John Newton can't believe it!<br />Clark does his usual great job creating memorable characters that the reader actually cares about.  This book is just as impressive in that area as his earlier works, especially &quot;Nailed By the Heart&quot;.<br />This is a book that has a great &quot;hook&quot; - &quot;creepy local legend that the townsfolk try to survive from generation to generation&quot;.  Newton and his family are caught in the middle of the legend and he does what he can to try and put an end to it.  When the life of his daughter becomes part of the &quot;game&quot; then the book really takes off.<br />&quot;Darkness Demands&quot; is a great novel that will certainly keep you turning the pages.  The suspense builds throughout the book and Clark really turns up the heat on the Newton family as the book progresses.  The ending is unexpected, but totally believeable.<br />If you enjoy a good yarn and are a fan of novelists such as, Owl Goingback, Stephen King or Richard Laymon, then I think you'll enjoy this book.  Clark is a very promising talent that should be around for a long, long, time.  Maybe long enough to create his own legends!<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!.

As Trisha attempts to reunite with her family, she actually ends up moving farther and farther away from them.  As day turns into night, she finally begins to realize that she will not quickly find her missing family and now instead, must be concerned with survival.<br />The rest of the book, of course, deals with this \\"struggle\\" and gives King an opportunity to delve into the mind of a \\"not-so-average\\" nine-year-old.  Trisha relies on her hero, Boston Red Sox closer, Tom Gordon, for inspiration as she fends for herself in the woods.  One of her biggest concerns is whether or not the batteries in her Walkman will hold out long enough for her to continue to turn in to the nightly Sox game before she is rescued.  She is as resilient as most of King's strong female leads and wise beyond her years.  Along the way, King introduces the \\"boogey-man\\" of this story which is a mysterious and unseen entity that leaves deep, deep slash marks in trees and various forest animals along the way.  This entity never quite exhibits the true terror that most of King's creepy characters demonstrate.<br />As the book lumbers along to it's expected climax, the reader will have an opportunity to enjoy King's style of prose.  The book is wonderfully written (as are all of King's works) with the usually memorable phrases and word pictures.  Don't let this review deter you from reading this book, just don't go into it with the typical expectations that one might have if they are a frequent reader of King's work.	2003-02-28

Let me start this review by simply saying that Michael Reisig is one of the best new storytellers that I have read in recent years!  Having read his extremely impressive apocalyptic novel, \\"The New Madrid Run\\", a few years ago, I was pleased to finally find a copy of \\"The Hawks of Kamalon\\".  What Reisig has created in this book is a novel of epic proportions.  He has created memorable characters entwined in a gripping and thrill-a-minute plot.<br />Take a novel that thrusts WWII pilots from the British and US Air Force into a cosmic world located light years away, throw in battle scenes taken straight out of the Battle of Britain and The Alamo and you've got \\"Hawks...\\".  The novel really takes off when the pilots are drawn through a time portal to serve as the last-ditch heroes for a nation under seige by an evil dictator.  Using their WWII Spitfires and P-51's to fill the skies with bombs and bullets to protect their new friends, they soon find themselves drawn closer to these people than they expected to be.  In a book filled with multiple heroes, Reisig does a fine job keeping all of the characters straight in the reader's mind while making an unbelieveable sci-fi premise, almost believeable.<br />\\"Hawks...\\" is a classic tale of good vs. evil and much of the action is straight out of a Clint Eastwood or John Wayne movie.  The battle scenes are very graphic and create vivid word pictures. And while the \\"escape from the throes of death\\" scenes that the heroes keep surviving are more than a little far-fetched, (reminded me a lot of the Matthew Reilly books, so his fans will love \\"Hawks...\\") this is a book filled with action, romance, and energy.<br />Unlike many reviewers who rave about not being able to put down certain novels, I rarely have experienced that sensation.  It's for that reason that I was so impressed with \\"Hawks...\\".  It really is \\"un-put-down-able\\"!  Here's hoping that Michael Reisig continues to write great stories like \\"Hawks...\\" and \\"The New Madrid Run\\" and begins to get the recognition on a national basis that he deserves for being a great storyteller!<br />HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!drid Run\\" and begins to get the recognition on a national basis that he deserves for being a great storyteller!<br />HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!	2003-02-17

In his book, \\"Night of the Lonesome October\\", Richard Laymon once again lets his imagination run wild.  This is the story of a relatively normal college student who finds that his true love has dumped him for another man.  As this young man, Ed Logan, tries to deal with his anguish, he encounters some tremendously weird (even for Laymon) characters.<br />His former girl friend's sorority sister, Eileen, tries to bring Ed out of his funk and, in doing so, falls head over heels in love with him.  As Ed and Eileen's relationship intensifies, they encounter some of their college town's strangest folk.  All the way from cannibal \\"trolls\\" who live under a bridge next to campus to a \\"bike hag\\" who tries to run people down as they stroll the city streets in the novel.  Throw in a bi-sexual fiend who's out to get both Ed and Eileen and a young homeless girl named Casey who spends every night of her live playing \\"hide or ride\\" and you've got some downright bizarre characters.  Where DOES he come up with people?<br />If all of this sounds far-fetched and unbelievable - then you can bet this is only the start and you have found yourself smack dab in the middle of a Richard Laymon novel.  As I write this I find myself wondering how I can summarize the plot without, you, the reader, thinking I'm making it up as I go.  That's the kind of roller coaster ride in store for those who read anything by Laymon.<br />While, not one of his top novels, (my personal favorite continues to be \\"Funland\\") you'll no doubt have a good time reading this rapidly-moving book.  As is typical in Laymon's books, there's plenty of violence, sex, and even an occasional mutant.  As has often been said about his work, \\"Laymon can't write a bad book\\"!<br />If you like off-the-wall type action with thrills and chills peeking around every corner, then by all means, grab a copy of \\"Night in the Lonesome October\\".	2003-02-05

Those familar with &quot;The General&quot; will no doubt be impressed that &quot;he tells it like it is&quot; as easily in the written form as he does with the spoken word.  There's no question that this is Knight's book!<br />Basketball coaches will appreciate the snippets that Knight provides of &quot;his&quot; approach to basketball.  While, not an &quot;X's and O's&quot; kind of book, there's plenty of basketball talk found here!  Knight philosophical view of the game (and competition itself) really jumps off the pages of the book.<br />There are copious amounts of &quot;name-dropping&quot; throughout the book, which I think shows the &quot;small-town boy&quot; that's still present in Knight's being.  Anecdotes about big-time celebs such Ted Williams, Howard Cosell, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, and Presidents Ford and Bush are prominently discussed, just to name a very few.  The index of the book is impressive if, for no only reason, then for the sheer number of major &quot;players&quot; that are displayed.<br />All in all, this is a very enjoyable and quick read.  Knight pulls no punches in discribing his firing from Indiana.  For Hoosier fans, some of it will be gut-wrenching!  Highly recommended for all basketball fans, but especially those from the Hoosier state!	2003-01-12

Finally, I got a copy through the good folks at Half.com and dove into the book.<br />It didn't take me long to realize that the long wait to get my hands on this book was worth it.  Brumfield (in his debut novel, no less) does a great job with character development and weaves a very believable plot.  So believable, in fact, that YOU really could see this happening to American tourists.  It's that basis in fact that helps to make this such an enjoyable reading experience.<br />As some of the earlier reviews mentioned, Brumfield takes some of the best elements from Tom Clancy, Speilberg's \\"Indiana Jones\\", and James Bond and makes it all work!  The book describes the travails of an American couple who get more than they bargain for as they finish their vacation along the Yucatan Peninsula.  When they are suddenly accused of espionage and drug-dealing, they are soon placed in an uncompromising situation that would strike fear in the hearts of any visiting American citizen.<br />Without going into TOO much detail, let me just say that a whirlwind adventure takes off from that point as the couple attempt to regain their freedom and clear their good name.  Along the way they get help from some very interesting and memorable characters.  Brumfield obviously has done extensive research in the Yucatan area because he does a great job painting vivid \\"word pictures\\" of the area.<br />Here's hoping you don't have as much trouble as I did finding a copy of this great novel!

Grisham again provides the reader with a sympathetic lead character who becomes an \\"everyman\\" as the story progresses.  And, while the plot is surely not as complex as the storyline in \\"The Firm\\", it jumps off the pages early in the book and allows the reader to settle in quickly.<br />Ray Atlee is a University of Virginia Law professor who's not had much contact with either his substance-abusing brother, Forrest, or his father, Rueben, a legendary judge from Clanton, Mississippi.  When Rueben dies after a lengthy illness, Ray is named the executor of the estate and must come to grips with both caring for his brother and dealing with his father's legacy.  As Ray begins to start the process of probating the will, he stumbles upon over $3 million in cash that is not included in the estate.  Where did this fortune come from and why didn't his nearly-destitute father include it in his estate or use it while he was alive?  As Ray searches for the answers (as well as what to do with the money) he finds out more about his father than he bargained for.<br />Expect to put aside some time to read this book.  Once you start the story, you WILL want to continue to read it through to the end.  Grisham's rapid-fire dialogue and sentence structure make this an extremely quick \\"read\\".  There are enough plot twists to keep most readers motivated and interested.<br />My only complaint is with the ending.  There were a number of different avenues that I felt Grisham could have taken to finish this novel.  Without going into too much detail, let me suffice to say that Grisham could probably have used a little more imagination to wrap up the story a little more tightly.  It was almost as if he was setting the stage for a sequel.  This is not enough to detract from an enjoyable reading experience, though!<br />RECOMMENDED!	2003-01-05

Written in a similar vein to \\"Evil Whispers\\", (\\"evil Indian spirit comes back to \\"life\\" to terrorize local populace\\") Goingback does his usual good job of establishing believable characters involved in an unbelievable plot.<br />This is not to say that you won't thoroughly enjoy \\"Breed\\", however.  Just suspend your powers of disbelief for a while and dig in.<br />The story begins when local mystics break into St. Augustine's Tolomato Cemetary and through their incantations, unlease an ancient Indian demon known as the \\"Shiru\\".  As the Shiru prepares to cross over into the world of the living, numerous deaths and mutilations occur.  When Detective Jack Colvin begins to investigate these strange deaths, he realizes that things may not be as they appear.  He becomes even more confused about the deaths when local tour guide, Ssabra Onih, reports to him that she believes that the murders are being committed by an ancient evil Indian spirit.  Ssabra loses credibility with Colvin when she explains that her knowledge of these events comes from the spirit of Indian Chief Tolomato (also a resident of Tolomato Cemetary) who has visited her on a number of occasions to warn the living world of the evil Shiru.<br />Now I know all of this sounds too fantastic to make a good yarn, but Goingback pulls it all together.  Fortunately for the reader, he spends most of the book's time in the present and creates a pretty good murder mystery.  Goingback also injected some humor into the book by making Chief Tolomato a relatively cynical and \\"hip\\" character.  The interaction between the Chief and Ssabra are some of the stronger parts of the book.  Even the ending was a little out of the ordinary for this type of story.  Not unsatisfying, just different than what I expected.<br />I was particularly impressed with Goingback's \\"on-the-money\\" descriptions of the St. Augustine area.  As a frequent visitor to this part of Florida, it was very rewarding to see the area so accurately depicted.  I appreciate his efforts and the time that he spent researching the St. Augustine area.<br />If this is the first book you've read by Goingback, be sure to give his other novels a look.

When linguist, William Race, is recruited to translate an ancient manuscript that holds the secret to the location of the idol, all hell breaks loose! Who will get the idol first, those intending to use it to destroy the world or those trying to save it?<br />Reilly takes the reader on a action joyride over the next 500 pages to the book's somewhat expected ending. Suspend your powers of logic, deduction and disbelief during that time and just enjoy the ride! There are some simply unbelievable situations that Race and his band encounter along the way, but there's little time to catch your breath as you're reading - so don't spend a lot of time \\"dissecting\\" the book.<br />Though, in this reviewer's humble opinion, \\"Temple\\" is not as strong an offering as Reilly's first novel, \\"Ice Station\\", it WILL keep you reading and fill a few days with an entertaining story loading with copious amounts of escapism. And, after all, isn't that what we're looking for when we're trying to kill a few hours?	2002-12-25
US	52840188	R2F8OIYIJYZGH2	0451202910	876467674	Evil Whispers	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Not quite as good as earlier works, but well worth your time	Owl Goingback follows his Bram Stoker Award-winning novel \\"Crota\\" and Stoker nominee, \\"Darker Than Night\\" with \\"Evil Whispers\\", a thriller set in the backwoods of Central Florida.<br />All that the Patterson family was looking for was a little peace and quiet away from the hustle and bustle of the Orlando area as they tried to spend a little quality time together. What they ended up with was a terrifying situation that every parent could identify with - the possible abduction of their child. Little Krissy Patterson has come up missing and the trail may lead to a long-departed demon known as Mansa Du Paul who's looking for a \\"vessel\\" that could bring him back to the real world. That vessel could be Krissy.<br />As the Patterson and the local townsfolk frantically search for Krissy, they encounter a misplaced Seminole, Jimmy Cypress, who becomes the prime suspect in the disappearance of the little girl. What the Pattersons don't realize is that it's Cypress who holds the key to the safe reunion of Krissy with her parents.<br />Goingback (a Native-American of Choctaw-Cherokee descent) uses his considerable knowledge of Indian lore and mysticism to weave a dandy of a plot. As Mansa creeps closer to reanimation, Goingback really turns up the jets and the gory and gruesome plot picks up speed. The word pictures are vivid and, as he has done in his earlier novels, Goingback creates very believeable characters.<br />While the ending is generally satisfying, I must admit that I was less than enamored with the explanation that Goingback used to wrap up the loose ends at the end of the book. It was almost as if he realized that he had gone too far beyond belief and couldn't get it back. Don't let that deter you from enjoying this finely-crafted novel of horror and suspense. I look forward to reading the other two books that Goingback has written, especially the well-received, \\"Breed\\".<br />RECOMMENDED	2002-12-09
US	52840188	R13TQV2LQ1JEUZ	0316693200	309666534	2nd Chance	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Not as good as 1st To Die, but holds it's own	James Patterson, that prolific author of great tales of murder and suspense, has succeeded in holding this reader's attention in \\"2nd Chance\\" - the second in a new series about a group of four professional women known as The Woman's Murder Club.<br />In this installment, newly-appointed Lt. Lindsey Boxer attempts to get to the bottom of a series of racially-motivated murders that threaten to tear her city apart.<br />The murders may be committed by a character known as the Chimera, who's retaliating against members of a police force (or their families) that helped put him in prison 20 years earlier.  As Lindsey struggles to catch the Chimera before he takes more lives, she once again is faced with personal difficulties.  Her long-lost father suddenly returns to the scene and attempts to reconnect with his daughter.  Lindsey is forced to deal with the bitterness she has harbored toward her father for all these years as she considers welcoming him back into her life.  But before she can do that she must decide what secrets her father, Marty Boxer, could possibly hold in connection with the Chimera.<br />The other members of the Women's Murder Club (Jill, the D.A., Claire, the Medical Examiner, and Cindy, the newspaper reporter) are each given stressful situations to deal with in this novel - ranging from pregnancy to a new love affair.  It was almost as if Patterson had to give them each an opportunity for a \\"curtain-call\\".  There's actually little that's new in the way that the Club members work together from this novel to the last.  I think Patterson could put more thought into how he could incorporate the areas of expertise of the Club members more into the plot.<br />Speaking of the plot, as I said earlier, it's certainly strong enough to keep your attention, but I didn't find myself flying through the pages as I do in the Alex Cross series (or even \\"1st To Die\\").  There are always some major unbelievable elements in a Paterson plot, but you can't argue with the sheer excitement that he generates in his novels.  And, as is the usual Patterson pattern, the ending has one more big twist waiting for the reader before the last page.<br />I don't think there's any question that fans of James Patterson will find this a satisfying novel.  While not as strong as the books in the Alex Cross series, \\"The Women's Murder Club\\" will most certainly meet again in near future to bring us a third installment of this series.heer excitement that he generates in his novels.

As a golf coach of over 20 years, I was eager to read Fred and Pete Shoemaker's, \\"Extraordinary Golf\\". For the most part, I would like to report that the book contains a great deal of constructive advice (mostly of the self-help variety) for the average golfer. The Shoemakers (and especially former PGA pro, Fred) seem to relate well to the problems that plague the average golfer, i.e. fear of embarrassment, lack of concentration, and the mental demons of uncertainty.<br />If you're looking for a book to help you with the physical part of the game, then this book is probably not for you. \\"EG\\" deals primarily with the cerebral aspects of the game and gives the golfer mental keys to follow. Especially helpful was the last section of the book which describes a number of exercises that can help the average golfer. I particularily enjoyed the section where the Shoemakers compare the ideal golf swing to the \\"act of club throwing\\". What other instructional book can you think of that has ever encouraged club throwing? You'll have the read it to believe it!<br />I'm sure some golf \\"purists\\" will shake their heads in amazement at some of the information in this book, but if the book is read with an open mind, then I think some benefits can be achieved.	2002-10-27
US	52840188	RGP3GZNP0Y0C4	0812516907	80850760	Shiva Descending	Books	3	12	12	N	N	Somewhat uneven, but it certainly has it's moments	3 and 1/2 stars actually.  \\"Shiva Descending\\" gets high marks as a book far ahead of its time as far as meteoric \\"space disasters\\" are concerned.  Written long before the topic became vogue, Benford and Rotsler do a creditable job describing what life would be like if Earth was threatened by an impending disaster of global proportions.<br />Unfortunately, it takes the authors too long to get to the \\"good stuff\\" and that's the main downfall of this novel, IMHO.  The selection of the astronauts assigned to save the world is interesting enough.  And so are the frequent depictions of the smaller meteor strikes in advance of the main astral body known as \\"Shiva\\".  Benford and Rotsler's view of worldwide paranoia, religious zeal, and sexual depravity in reaction to this pending catastrophic event is disturbing at best.  But... probably not too far from the truth if a disaster of this proportion ever threatens the earth.<br />This story becomes more uneven as the authors try and describe how world governments would react during a situation like this.  Would world leaders be shallow enough to take their own lives instead of attempting to save their countrymen?  Would a US President turn to debauchery and apathy instead of trying to be a leader?  (The analogy of a banjo-playing President and Nero, his violin, and a burning Rome definitely came to my mind as the asteroid got closer to Earth.)<br />The other main complaint that I have is that there are so many characters introduced in this novel, that the authors can't really do justice to character development.  In particular, I would have really liked to have seen Brother Gabriel's character developed a little more.<br />As an earlier reviewer pointed out, the last third of the book is riveting.  You'll be on the edge of your seat as the book takes a few twists and turns before arriving at it's (expected) ending.  It should be noted that this book is often given credit for spawning movies like \\"Armageddon\\" and \\"Deep Impact\\".  It should also be noted that like most books, the novel is superior to the film version(s).<br />Should you read this book?  Yes.  It is well-researched and imaginative.  Is it one of the best of the Apocalyptic genre' books?  No.  I would recommend instead ... \\"Rift\\" by Walter Williams, \\"The New Madrid Run\\" by Michael Reisig, or \\"Earth Abides\\" by George Stewart.It should also be noted that like most books, the novel is superior to the film version(s).   <br />Should you read this book?

Take \\"Indiana Jones\\" and mix with \\"Rambo\\" as written by Tom Clancy and you've got a pretty good picture of what lies in store for you when you pick up a copy of \\"Ice Station\\".  This debut novel from the pen of Matthew Reilly is a thrill-a-minute, action-fest with some of the most discriptive battle scenes that I've ever read.  Reilly does a great job creating word-pictures that stay with the reader long after the book has been put down.<br />\\"Ice Station\\" takes the reader to an Antarctic outpost that could hold secrets vital to national defense.  When a group of Marines answer a call for help at Wilkes Ice Station, they definitely find more than they expected.  Have they stumbled on to an alien space vessel or a secret weapon developed by their own government?  And why are so many countries interested in possessing what the Marines find?<br />The characterization is tremendous in this novel.  The reader finds him- or herself getting very close to the Marines and some of the scientists that they end up protecting.  The plot, although more than a little farfetched, is extremely entertaining and the books moves along at warp speed.  Don't sit down to read this novel unless you're prepared to spend some sleepless nights until you finish it!<br />I look for great things from young Mr. Reilly and I will make it a priority to read his 2nd and 3rd novels, \\"Temple\\" and \\"Area 7\\".  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	2002-10-09

It most certainly won't be his last!<br />His tight, well-crafted plot is fueled by terrific characters with which the reader can sympathize.<br />The plot revolves around an ancient curse that hangs over the English seacoast village of Out-Butterwick.  The locals speak of an ancient god who periodically demands a sacrifice from the townsfolk in order to leave them and their village intact.<br />When the villagers become concerned that the Stainforth family coming into the community to repair and revive an old coastal &quot;hotel&quot; will anger the god with their plan, the plot really takes off.  Soon, strange zombie-like creatures are spotted in the surf along the seafort and the family and  villages must band together against the assault that ensues.<br />Without giving away too much plot let me just say that the rest of the novel deals with the townfolk's attempt to survive the onslaught.  The Stainforth family is presented with the ultimate sacrifice with their lives and those of the villagers hanging in the balance.<br />Fans of Dean Koontz, Clive Barker, and Robert McCammon will certainly find a new star in Simon Clark.  His novels are becoming more prolific here in the US, so enjoy!	2002-09-21
US	52840188	R1NMOJGCAMD4QU	0843949783	372932416	Island	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Laymon continues successful formula	Richard Laymon seems to have two types of audiences:  those purely uninhibited souls who are not shocked one bit with his gratuitous sex, violence, and graphic storytelling and those (like me) who consider his books such a guilty pleasure, that I'm continually looking over my shoulder to see if anyone is looking at what I'm reading.  Often times, during a session of reading Laymon novels, I feel like I should go hose myself off because his content makes me feel almost smarmy!<br />Those who enjoy the works of the dearly-departed Laymon, will surely revel in \\"Island\\".  This is a story about a group of castaways trapped on a desert island with a killer who is systematically trying to eliminate them.  The catch is that most of the survivors model Laymon's typical view of women:  voluptuous pin-up types who drive men wild.  The \\"man\\" in this book who is being driven wild is Rubert Conway, a very randy, oversexed 18-year old who can't really decide if he wants to be rescued and have his fantasies stopped.<br />Before it sounds like I am actually panning this novel, instead of praising it, let me say that the only thing that's really out of line in this book is Rupert's approach to the murders that occur early in the book and his real motivation in trying to keep HIS \\"women folk\\" alive.  The rest of the book is really quite interesting and full of action.  Character development is strong as usual and most of the characters are rather likeable.  All of Laymon's  books \\"read\\" fast and \\"Island\\" is no different.  And, though the novel weighs in at a hefty 500+ pages, it reads like a book much smaller.<br />Without giving away too much of the plot, let me just say that the castaways find survival a daily problem and violence and mayhew await on nearly every page.  The book is written from Rupert's point of view and Laymon does a great job telling the story from an 18-year old's frame of reference and mindset.  There aren't any real great secrets to the plot and even the ending is pretty much expected.  Don't let that deter you from purchasing or checking out \\"Island\\" - it's a real \\"guilty pleasure\\"!ng is pretty much expected.

Former Navy SEAL, Mike Turcotte and his eclectic group of cohorts again lead the fight against an alien takeover of the planet.<br />But which of the alien races is our friend and which is our enemy?<br />That is only one of the questions that Doherty tries to answer in this installment of the series.  Faithful readers of the series will soon find the unique \\"tie-ins\\" with Earth's history that Doherty provides.  His vivid imagination does a fantastic job linking The Sphinx, Noah's Ark, The Black Plague, The Arc of the Covenant, The Holy Grail, the rise of the Nazi SS, and Excalibur together as activites and events that were either casued by, or affected by the alien cultures.<br />In this installment, Turcotte and his band attempt to quell the attacks of the Kortad and Airlia as they each try to take over the globe.  The adventure stretches from Area 51 to Pearl Harbor and from Mt. Ararat to Mt. Everest.  If you are a fan of the series, you'll love \\"Excalibur\\".  If you are new to the series you need to go back and start with \\"Area 51\\".  Either way, you can't go wrong with this series.<br />The series (as we know it, anyway) culminates with the 7th and last installment, \\"Area 51: The Truth\\" later in the year.	2002-09-05

Oh, the book starts out with enough action to set the tone and keep the reader involved, but unfortunately, starts to lose steam near the halfway point.<br />Trucker Josh Spiller finds himself trying to decide if saving his relationship with his now-pregnant girl friend is worth the effort.  As he tries to sort out his thoughts while on the job, he makes a &quot;wrong turn&quot; into the town of Furnace, Virginia, where his life becomes changed forever.<br />There's no denying that Josh is a solid enough character, but I can't really say that any of the other characters will extend too far beyond your short-term memory limits.  The writing is uneven enough to make the plot jumpy and somewhat hard to stay with.  And, the &quot;hold&quot; that local witch, Nelly McFarland, has over the locals is just a little too much to believe.<br />As the plot finally decelerates to it's inevitable climax, you won't be either surprised or overjoyed by the conclusion;  maybe just relieved that it's over.  But, don't take my word for it, because a number of other reviewers obviously think differently.  Just don't say you haven't been warned!	2002-08-29

Preston and Child have done it again!  \\"The Cabinet of Curiosities\\" is a wonderful story with familar characters and rich content.  P & C have brought back archeologist/museum researcher Nora Kelly, journalist Bill Smithback, and FBI Special Agent Pendergast to try and solve a series of serial killings that may have started as long ago as 130 years.  P&C provide the protagionists (and the reader) with a variety of clues along the way as the threesome try and decide if it is a \\"copycat\\" killer who's reponsible for the murders or a century-old scientist who may have discovered the secret to prolonging human life.<br />There's the usual amount of suspense and gore along the way, but not to the point of being gratuitous!  Plenty of \\"medical-speak\\" that P&C books are noted for is present and the word pictures that P&C use to describe the \\"cabinets of curiosities\\" (precursors to the first museums in the 1800's) that our protagonists discover along the way are absolutely riveting!<br />The \\"on/off again\\" romance between Nora and Smithback adds some spark to their relationship and Agent Pendergast is his usual mysterious self.  His character is given even greater depth in \\"TCoC\\" and we find out a great deal more about his past in this book.  (By the way, look for Pendergast to star in the next P&C novel tentatively titled, \\"Still Life With Crows\\" scheduled for a summer 2003 release.)<br />Plot twists abound, although \\"TCoC\\" is a little more straightforward in it's march to it's finale.  The ending may leave some readers feeling a little dissatisfied, yet this writer felt it was a appropriate way to finish the novel.  (After finishing the book, some readers may wish to check out the alternate ending that P&C have created for the book found at their website, prestonchild.com)<br />If you're a fan of the P&C books, you'll in for a real treat with \\"TCoC\\".  If you're new to these two terrific writers, I suggest you start with their first (and still probably their best) book, \\"Relic\\".  Either way you can't go wrong!elic\\".

Sounds pretty interesting, doesn't it?  That's what I thought too when I picked this book up.  Unfortunately, this book just doesn't quite live up to expectations.<br />For the most part, David &quot;delivers&quot; by creating some interesting characters (in particular, the savants), but the plot (and ANY believability) begins to lose steam in the last 200 pages of the book.  This happens when the ghost of a young girl, who took her revenge against a group of college fraternity boys by murdering them 60 years ago, suddenly returns to finish the job by &quot;working&quot; through the savants &quot;super-personality&quot;.<br />The other major flaw in this novel (IMHO) is the relationship between the two major characters, Wes and Elizabeth.  It's clumsy and sophomoric and takes away from the plot.  It's almost as if David felt like he needed just to throw something else into the mix.  As a matter of fact, the &quot;Wes&quot; character is<br />just plain annoying.  It's hard to imagine how such a &quot;whiner&quot; could become a scientist of his stature. He is shown as a petty and rather immature individual who cares little for the savants and their needs.<br />The ending is rather pedestrian and comes to a pretty abrupt halt.  But, by that point, I think David was probably ready for this book to end as well.<br />James F. David appears to be a promising author based on what I read in &quot;Fragments&quot;.  There are a few flaws that I think he will be able to work out as he creates more plots and characters.  I haven't read his first book, &quot;Footprints of Thunder&quot; or his latest, &quot;Before the Cradle Falls&quot;, but I think he shows enough potential to give them both a try.	2002-07-07

You don't need to be a baseball fan to enjoy (and benefit from) the words of wisdom in Yogi Berra's book, \\"When You Come to a Fork in the Road, Take It!\\". Yogi explains and refines the numurous malapropisms that he noted for is this short and quick read.<br />Without going into the many \\"Yogi-isms\\" found in this book, let me suffice to say that you'll get a better perspective on life after reading it. Yogi does a great job giving advice and sharing his worldly experiences with the reader in his own inimitable way. This would be an outstanding graduation gift to share with young people ready to embark on their own life journey. I think it would especially appeal to young athletes who may already be somewhat familar with the Berra legacy.<br />Older readers will certainly enjoy the \\"Yogi-isms\\" that are used as the chapter titles and the numerous pictures from Yogi's photo archive. Yogi is a lovable baseball figure who has furthered his appeal factor by putting his thoughts down in words. Here's hoping that each reader will take something a little different from the experience!	2002-07-03

In reading some of the other reviews of this book, it seems that there's little &quot;gray&quot; in the feelings people have about it.<br />They either find it great fun and adventure or useless tripe.  I choose to align with the first group!<br />&quot;The Ice Limit&quot; is a novel set along the lines of what fans of Preston and Child have come to expect...good characterization, great gadgets, and &quot;off-the-wall&quot; plots.  They certainly cover all three bases in this book!  The 400+ pages in this novel seem to fly by due to solid writing and some rather short chapters.<br />When the world's 7th richest man decides that he wants to add to his eclectic collection of world's &quot;greatest and biggest&quot;, the reader is set forth on an adventure of grand proportions.  What he seeks is a red meteorite weighing in at 250,000 tons.  Money becomes no object in this billionaire's quest, so he hires the best experts and scientists and biggest ship that money can buy.  Greed is the motivating factor for most of these people, except for archi-geologist Sam McFarlane who wants to study the meteorite for science's sake and Ship Captain Sally Britton, both of whom are seeking to put troubled pasts behind them.<br />Weather and the Chilean Navy play big roles in the success and/or failure of this venture.  Without giving away too much of the plot, let me suffice to say that there are twists and turns every few pages with an ending that certainly leaves the door open for a sequel.<br />For those of you who like the novels of Cussler, Crichton, James Rollins, Robert Darnton, or a good &quot;Indiana Jones-type yarn&quot;, you won't go wrong with &quot;The Ice Limit&quot;.  While perhaps not as good as the authors' eariler hits, &quot;Relic&quot; and &quot;Reliquary&quot;, this book stands on it's own merits and would make a great motion picture.	2002-06-29
US	52840188	R3D6CP9MDNV2E3	0446610038	30029813	1st to Die: A Novel (Women's Murder Club, No 1)	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Reliable Patterson does it again!	James Patterson's style of murder/mystery/thriller fiction takes a new turn in his novel, \\"1st To Die\\".  Using female FBI agent, Lindsay Boxer, as the main character, Patterson brings out his feminine side in Boxer's attempt to catch a serial killer who preys on newlyweds.  Boxer must not only try and outthink the crafty murderer, but deal with her own health problems and a potential romance along the way.<br />Fortunately for Boxer, (and the reader because this story needed a few more characters) she is able to enlist the help of a team of \\"experts\\" (a medical examiner, a news reporter, and an assistant D.A.) who help her finally catch the bad guy in the end.  Along the way, Patterson moves us along at warp-speed to the ultimate climax.  His short, staccato chapters (and some great writing) make his books almost impossible to put down because you always feel you can read just a little longer.<br />Without giving away too much of the novel, let me simply say that there are a number of the expected twists and turns along the way that Patterson's fans will quickly recognize and expect.  And, as usual, Patterson always has ONE MORE big surprise at the end of the book before the reader can finally put the story to rest.<br />If you're a Patterson fan, you'll enjoy \\"1st To Die\\".  The \\"tried-and-true\\" formula that Patterson employs is present in this book and as usual a very quick \\"read\\".  Female fans may really like the book because of the \\"Woman's Murder Club\\" created by the aforementioned characters.  Men, on the other hand, will not confuse Lindsay Boxer with Patterson's other main character from earlier novels, Alex Cross, but will enjoy the book nonetheless.	2002-06-16
US	52840188	R5KZGDVEB80X6	1585861553	632667723	Slob	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Shocking, fantastic and replusive!	&quot;Slob&quot; is a fantastic adventure into the mind of a serial killer.  In what is the first of a number of books about Daniel Bunkowski (a.k.a. Chaingang), Rex Miller has created a character that is so grotesque and replusive, that it's hard to imagine anything like him.  Hannibal Lecter is tame in comparison.  Miller does a great job developing the &quot;Chaingang&quot; character and giving the reader a primer in &quot;how to create a serial killer&quot;.<br />&quot;Slob&quot; is definitely not for the faint of heart.  The graphic decriptions of Chaingang's killing sprees border on being too intense.  Miller pulls no punches and makes no apologies for his style.<br />Having actually read one of the sequels to &quot;Slob&quot;, (&quot;Savant&quot;) about five years ago, I was interested to see how the series started out, so I was pleased to find a copy of this book.  (For years it's been out of print and almost impossible to find.)<br />My only complaint about this book and indeed the whole series, is the unbelievable unfallability that Chaingang has.  Here's a 400+ pound giant that moves with the stealth and grace of a cat burgler.  His intellectual abilities also appear to be too &quot;godlike&quot; and prescient.<br />With all of that in mind, this is an extremely &quot;quick&quot; read and one that's hard to put down.  If you're a fan of Thomas Harris or James Patterson, then you'll find the works of Rex Miller to your liking.	2002-06-03

I've read all of the Area 51 books and found them to be imaginative and believable enough to appear to be somewhat based in fact.<br />Sadly, I didn't find much to make &quot;Psychic Warrior&quot; a book I would recommend to Doherty's fans.<br />While the style of writing was Doherty's usual clear and consise manner, &quot;Psychic Warrior&quot; was dragged down by TOO MUCH information and not enough story!  Doherty decided to spend the bulk of his story decribing how the psychic warriors were chosen, trained, and deployed and not enough time developing the plot.  Doherty did a good job researching and creating the concept (in this case, soldiers who can use their minds to wage war), but the plot borders too much on the fantastic.<br />Here's hoping that the sequel to &quot;Psychic Warrior&quot; takes off early with a great plot and saves this series!	2002-06-03

I beg to differ with many of the reviewers of Jeff Long's &quot;The Descent&quot; who raved about &quot;this epic novel&quot;.  This was a book that practically grabbed me by the collar as I read the back cover, yet unfortunately, left me wanting more - a lot more after I read it!<br />Now, don't get me wrong, I really wanted this novel to work!Long's plot of an underground race of subhumans known as the Hadals (possibly responsible for all of the sightings of beings like Sasquatch and little green men&quot;), was extremely intruiging.  He failed to deliver the &quot;goods&quot; however, and turned a promising concept into a book I couldn't wait to stop reading.  In addition to being dozens of pages TOO LONG, &quot;The Descent&quot; is filled with characters that you don't really care about.  Long spends too much time trying to develop these characters and because of his wordiness, it's too easy to become disinterested and confused.<br />Had Long spent more time building some action into the plot and developing the Hadal creatures, then I think he would really have had quite a novel!<br />In my humble opinion, I would recommend that you stick to James Rollins, Michael Reisig, or Jeff Rovin if you enjoy novels about this kind of fantastic adventure.  Each of these writers are effective in character development and write in a tight, page-turning manner!	2002-05-12
US	52840188	R2I57XU2QUUEWR	039914787X	92000199	Valhalla Rising (Dirk Pitt Adventures)	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Tried and tested "Dirk Pitt formula" works once again	\\"Valhalla Rising\\" starts off like most Cussler novels with a trip to the past to set the tone and plot for the novel.  In this book, we are transported back to the early 11th Century and spend times with Vikings who have begun to explore the North American continent 400 years before Columbus.  When we are shot back to present day, we soon find Dirk Pitt, Al Giordino, and friends battling an evil CEO determined to control the world's oil supply with the ultimate goal of taking over the United States.  Pitt calls on all of the reserves of National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA)to thwart the plan.  Cussler shares his vivid imagination with us throughout the book painting numerous word pictures as he introduces us to some absolutely fantastic water craft and villians.<br />OK, like most Dirk Pitt novels, logic and believability can be \\"checked at the door\\".  But that's why Cussler continues to be so successful with this formula.  Many, many people read novels to ESCAPE from their humdrum world and I'm sure that most Cussler fans fall into that category.<br />All of the familar characters are present in \\"Valhalla Rising\\" and some have larger roles than normal.  The same large doses of action, techno-gimmicks, and fantastic cars and ships abound in this book.  For those of you who are fans of this series, you'll not be disappointed and will find \\"Vahalla Rising\\" as comfortable as your favorite old pair of tennis shoes.<br />If you're new to the world of Dirk Pitt, you'll either find him totally enchanting (kind of a cross between Indiana Jones and James Bond) or so unbelievable that you'll have difficulty swallowing the fantastic adventure found in each Cussler novel.	2002-04-21

Jeff Rovin, as eclectic an author as one will find writing today, definitely knows how to spin a \\"yarn\\".  (See two of his other works, \\"Vespers\\" and \\"The Return of the Wolf Man\\" as examples.)<br />\\"Fatalis\\" is the story of a pack sabre-tooth tigers that reanimate after some climate and topicgraphical changes to terrorize Santa Barbara, CA, on the way to their (famous) ancestral home.  Hunted down by the local sheriff, a war-hardened Vietnam vet who has taken the tigers appearance in his town personal, the story also centers on the attempt of an anthropologist to resurrect his own life, while trying to save that of the tigers.  Rounding out the triangle is a newspaper reporter desparately seeking personal and professional respect.<br />If you can accept the premise regarding the appearance of the tigers, then you'll soon find yourself immersed in a pretty good story.  Graphically violent in places, it moves along at a fast clip as it hurdles to the ultimate (and expected) climax.<br />My main criticisms of the book are that it spends a little too much time regarding the spiritual connection between Jim Grand, the anthropologist, and his mentor college professor-turned-shaman. Their interaction was not all that vital to the development with the plot appearing to be more fluff than substance. The other problem that I had with the book was with the lack of the development of secondary characters.  Rovin had a couple of great opportunities to involve some of the interesting fringe characters in the plot, but for some reason chose not to include them to any great degree.<br />Be that as it may, this is still an enjoyable experience.  You won't find any huge plot twists, and, while Rovin can't resist sticking in technical jargon from time to time, it does add something to the story.  Like a good Michael Crichton novel, the jargon gives the author a chance to show off a little of his research efforts.<br />Along that line, if you like the works of Crichton, James Rollins (\\"Subterranean\\"), or John Darnton (\\"Neanderthal\\"), then you're find this a comparable effort.n gives the author a chance to show off a little of his research efforts.  <br />Along that line, if you like the works of Crichton, James Rollins (\\"Subterranean\\"), or John Darnton (\\"Neanderthal\\"), then you're find this a comparable effort.	2002-03-31

Underrated (and somewhat unknown) Charles Wilson has done it again!  \\"When We First Deceive\\" is a superior novel about a small Mississippi town's attempt to hunt down and stop a serial killer that taunts police with mysterious clues.  When one of the deaths turns out to be the former lover of the town's young police lieutenant, things heat up fast!<br />Husband and wife law officers, Lt. Brett and Officer Paige Dunnigan, are the central characters in this pot boiler.  Wilson, however, does a fantastic job of developing other characters quickly and effectively in this extremely fast \\"read\\".  You find yourself almost meshing into the storyline because you get to know these people so well!<br />Not being one to give away much of a plot when I write these reviews, let me suffice to say that this book will have you scratching your head throughout.  Just when it appears that the crime will be solved, another \\"twist in the road\\" appears.  Who is it that's really responsible for the deaths;  the local cororer, the FBI agent, the sheriff, or perhaps even Brett Dunnigan himself?<br />If you've read any other books by Charles Wilson then you already know that he's a master storyteller.  If this is your first Wilson book, then you're in for a great treat and you'll quickly find yourself looking for some of his other works as soon as you're finished.  Especially recommended would be \\"Nightwatcher\\"!	2002-03-24
US	52840188	RK4GJ14CIZXRR	0312868855	396467465	Hell House	Books	3	6	9	N	N	This is not going to be popular...	Based on what other reviewers of this book has already stated, this is NOT going to be a well-received review.  With that in mind, let me say that I was more than a little disappointed with &quot;Hell House&quot;.<br />This may be one of the only times in my life when I've stated that the MOVIE might be better than the BOOK.  Richard Matheson, whom I have the greatest respect and admiration for, really didn't hit the mark with &quot;Hell House&quot;.  Oh, I know that most of the reviews here go on and on about what a terrific book this is, but IMHO it comes up short in the &quot;thrills&quot; department.<br />It's really hard to like most, if not all, of the characters in &quot;Hell House&quot;.  They are not very sympathetic which seems to be an important element in horror novels.  Don't get me wrong, Matheson is a great storyteller, it's just that I feel that THIS story comes up a little short. After you get into the first 100 pages or so, it's easy to see why this book would be a great movie (based on special effects) but a rather limp book!<br />The thrills are limited and it's extremely hard to &quot;connect&quot; with this novel.  The best ghost stories are those that have a bases in reality and, unfortunately, this one misses the mark.<br />Matheson does a tremendous job in his books, &quot;I Am Legend&quot; and &quot;The Incredible Shinking Man&quot; and I wholeheartedly recommend these to the reader.  His contributions to &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; are beyond compare, as well!<br />But unfortunately, I can't recommend &quot;Hell House&quot; in the same way.  If you want to read something that contains really scary mental scenes involving haunted houses, pick up &quot;Ghost Story&quot; by Peter Straub or &quot;Poltergeist&quot; by Colin Wilson and bypass this book.	2002-03-15
US	52840188	R3A82MGX4Q9MWO	0671731424	481568206	The Wolf's Hour	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Not your average WWII novel!	One of the great storytellers in the horror/thriller genre' is Robert McCammon.  In \\"The Wolf's Hour\\", McCammon asks the rhetorical question, \\"what is the lycanthrope, in the eye of God?\\".  The answer of course, and the premise of the novel is, \\"the lycanthrope is God's avenger\\". For 600+ pages, that's just what happens in \\"The Wolf's Hour\\".  Master spy and werewolf, Michael Gallatin, wreaks havoc against the \\"Master Race\\" as he attempts to unravel the mystery of the Nazi's secret weapon, \\"Iron Fist\\", before it can be used against the Allies.<br />McCammon does such a great job telling this story that the \\"werewolf angle\\" almost becomes secondary to the plot.  It's a good enough war story to stand on its own merits without a gimmick.  The characterization, as usual in a McCammon book, is outstanding with many unforgettable players (both good and bad) that pop up along the way.  I challenge the reader not to come up with vivid mental images of the characters, \\"Boots\\" and \\"Kitty\\".  In this writer's humble opinion, McCammon is almost the equal of Stephen King in this department.<br />The only flaw in this novel is the extensive background information given to explain to the reader how and why Michael Gallatin (then Mikhail Gallatinov) became a lycanthrope.  I found myself quickly skimming those sections (and finally skipping them altogether) just to get back to the war story.<br />Robert McCammon has again hit the target with \\"The Wolf's Hour\\".  He continually provides shocks, thrills and great plots for his readers.  It's too bad that he has gone into semi-retirement and deprived his audience of additional great stories from his vivid imagination.<br />(Also highly recommended - Swan Song, They Thirst, Mine, and Stinger!)	2002-03-05

It's part &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, part &quot;Earth Abides&quot; and part &quot;Dawn of the Living Dead&quot;.  If you enjoyed any or all of those books, then this novel is for you!<br />Simon Clark has created an epic work in less than 400 pages.  This is an extremely fast &quot;read&quot; and you'll find yourself wanting more at the conclusion.  Evidently Clark, himself, realized that when he finished &quot;Blood Crazy&quot; because the door is certainly open for a sequel.<br />The characterization in the book is terrific and the story grabs you by the throat in the first few pages and refuses to let go until the very end.  Vividly graphic word pictures are woven throughout the novel and some of the sections are not for the faint of heart.  If you can get over that little &quot;hurdle&quot; then by all means find a copy of this book.<br />While the premise of this book is about parents attempt to systematically eliminate all the children from the earth, much of it is about the growth of a young man named Nick who is forced to assume a leadership role even though he is reluctant to do so. He finds that the &quot;doubt demons&quot; in his mind are almost as dangerous to his development as his parents.<br />This is the 2nd of many Simon Clark books that will be published in the US because I predict that his fans will be legion.  Good work, Mr. Clark, I can't wait for more!	2002-02-12

All of the Laymon staples are present, i.e. great characterizations, sympathetic lead characters, gratuitous sex and violence, copious amounts of blood and vividly graphic scenes.<br />\\"In the Dark\\" is the story of the 2 week adventure of a small town librarian who, starved for excitement and love, finds both as she is manipulated by a heinous villian known only by his acronym, M.O.G. or \\"Master of Games\\".  Why MOG picks out this librarian named Jane is never really explained, but he sends her scurrying all over town at midnight picking up envelopes of cash as she deciphers his clues and poems.<br />Laymon's books often take ordinary people and puts them in extraordinary circumstances bordering on the unbelieveable.  \\"In the Dark\\" is no exception.  Jane's greed, as she searches for MOG's envelopes of money and clues is sometimes hard to fathom, especially since most of the searches take place during the \\"witching hour\\".  She's a brave young lady, but portrayed as almost TOO brave!  Along the way Jane finds love in the person of Brace, a college professor.  As she pursues MOG's money, she begins to lose track of what's really important in life - that the love of a good person is much more valuable than any amount of money.<br />I'll stop here because it is not my intent to give away the entire plot.  As long as you can put aside some of the unbelieveable portions of \\"In the Dark\\", then you'll find this to be a extremely fast read which will keep you up way into the wee hours of the morning.  Laymon has done it again, reinforcing the credo of his fans that \\"he can't write a bad book!\\".	2002-02-02

When I first sat down to write this review I stopped after a few sentences because I realized I was being overly harsh toward a brand-new author.  It's really unfair to compare Du Brul to Clive Cussler because, while he shows promise, he has a long way to go.  Maybe it's a little like comparing Kobe Bryant to Michael Jordan.  Flashes of brillance yes, but not the consistent performance of the seasoned veteran!<br />So, with that in mind, let me say that &quot;Vulcan's Forge&quot; is for the most part an enjoyable read.  It is uneven in spots and somewhat hard to follow in others.  The characterization is fair, but the action is intense and shows Du Brul's potential.<br />And, while I can't give the book more than 3 stars, I am willing to give Du Brul's next offering, &quot;Charon's Landing&quot; a shot without giving up completely on him.<br />Maybe you should too.  If you're willing to slosh through some slow parts and put up with a &quot;rookie&quot; effort, then give it a try.  Just don't expect to find the &quot;magic&quot; of Clive Cussler in Du Brul's writing.	2002-01-19

After being somewhat disappointed with &quot;Riptide&quot;, I was more than pleased with &quot;Thunderhead&quot; - authors Doug Preston and Lincoln Child's homage to the world of archeology.<br />The authors have returned to the successful formula they used in &quot;Relic&quot; , &quot;Reliquary&quot;, and &quot;Mount Dragon&quot; - that being a great plot &quot;hook&quot; to reel the reader quickly into the story along with plenty of action, graphic violence, and great characterization!<br />Archeology professor, Nora Kelly, is stuck in a rut.  She's backed into the corner of &quot;publish or perish&quot; that faces many young university faculty members and she really doesn't have anything to offer.  That is, until she &quot;receives&quot; a letter from her long-dead father describing the hidden kingdom of the Anasazi Indians - an archelogical dig that could rival Howard Carter's unearthing of the riches of King Tut!<br /><br />From there, Kelly and her eclectic team embark on an exciting and visually discriptive adventure.  Almost every step of the way, mysterious Anasazi &quot;skinwalkers&quot; attempt to foil the teams efforts, even if it means murdering every one of them.<br />If you're a fan of the aforementioned works of Preston and Child's, you won't be disappointed with &quot;Thunderhead&quot;.  It is a consistent pageturner that my only complaint with was a relatively predictable ending.  Predictable, but satisfying, so I guess that makes it all ok.	2001-12-24

The sky's the limit for a writer with this much storytelling skill.<br />&quot;Crota&quot; is a great story that weaves an Indian legend, small town life, &quot;caving&quot;, and learning to believe in one's self into a horrifying and fast-moving plot.  When an earthquake along the New Madrid Fault allows a legendary monster to walk the earth again, all hell breaks loose for the residents of a rural Missouri area.  It takes the combined efforts of a brave sheriff and two Native American shaman to battle the beast.  Along the way, copious amounts of blood is spilled and the deaths of a number of the residents is graphically portrayed.  This is NOT a book for the faint of heart.<br />&quot;Crota&quot; is an extremely fast read and almost impossible to put down.  It grabs you by the throat in the first 20 pages and refuses to let go until the end.  It's comparable to some of the best works of Dean Koontz, Robert McCammon, and Richard Laymon.

In &quot;The Last Amateurs&quot; (a title that sounds like it could be a Bruce Willis film title), author John Feinstein (&quot;A Good Walk Spoiled&quot; and &quot;The Majors&quot; to name a few), returns to his true love, college basketball.  In revisiting a subject that he last broached in his &quot;expose'&quot; of Bobby Knight and the Indiana Hoosiers in &quot;Season on the Brink&quot;, Feinstein proves very quickly that this book is a labor of love and that he is indeed a true fan of the sport.<br />His subject matter is the 1999-2000 basketball season of Patriot League members, Navy, Lafayette, Lehigh, Army, Bucknell, Colgate, and Holy Cross.  Although I consider myself a serious fan of college basketball, I must admit, I knew very little about this league or its teams until reading this book.  Having grown up a fan of Big Ten basketball, I'm not sure I could have identified the states, let alone the cities, that these Patriot League teams called &quot;home&quot;.  And, while I was certainly recognized the names of the league best known coaches, Ralph Willard and Don Devoe, the rest of the leagues coaches and players toiled away in basic anominity.<br />Feinstein changed all that.<br />His description of the dedication and effort that these teams put forth every year, with little national recognition, was intriguing.  He drove you to get to know these players and coaches better.  And, along the way, gave the reader a vision of what college basketball (and athletics) should really be about - working toward graduation and playing for your school's pride (instead of playing to impress NBA scouts).  This is the purist's view of college basketball and it was refreshing to read!<br />I would encourage any fan of college athletics to give this book a try.  In a sport where one's allegiance to his school lasts only until agents come knocking at his door, it is refreshing to read about players who genuinely care for one another and their alma mater.  To read about these true &quot;student-athletes&quot; (who worried about missing classes and took course work with them on road trips) is a tremendous breath of fresh air.ese true &quot;student-athletes&quot; (who worried about missing classes and took course work with them on road trips) is a tremendous breath of fresh air.	2001-12-05

One real weakness of the book is that the reader has to sift through Northcutt's banal chapter introductions to get to the &quot;good stuff&quot;.  Many times the introductions are just needless fluff.  We KNOW these people did amazingly dumb things or they wouldn't be in the book!<br />That aside, the stories about the award winners definitely overcome Northcutt's limitations as an author.  (Maybe she should have thought about just being the &quot;editor&quot;.)  The chapters are well constructed and cover just about every imaginable subject under the sun.  Particularily good are the chapters on &quot;Animal Adventures&quot; and &quot;Fire and Explosion&quot;.

Paul Wilson. When I picked up &quot;Nightwatcher&quot; and read the back cover, I was hooked. I normally read a little bit of a book and then put it down for a while, but with this novel that just wasn't going to be the case. &quot;Nightwatcher&quot; is one of those types of books that you almost scorch burn your fingers getting the pages turned.<br />Built on great characterization and a well-crafted plot, &quot;Nightwatcher&quot; will be a hit with readers who enjoy serial-killer -type thrillers.  The setting of the book, a Mississippi state mental hospital, is a suitably creeping location and gives the book a &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;-type feel.  As a matter of fact, in this writer's humble opinion, &quot;Nightwatcher&quot; is very comparable to &quot;Silence...&quot; without copying it.<br />If you like Thomas Harris, James Patterson, or Rex Miller, you'll really enjoy &quot;Nightwatchers&quot;.

All of the familiar characters are present and true to form.<br />I disagree with the Amazon reviewers who criticize the book's ending and predictability.  There are more than a few twists and turns throughout the book and, the ones that you do figure out ahead of time make the book no less entertaining.<br />&quot;Roses Are Red&quot; ranks with Patterson's earlier Alex Cross books, &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; and &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot;.  He does a great job getting the reader quickly involved in the story.  Try if you must, but you can't help but get caught up in Cross' pain and suffering as he tries to cope with the changes in his personal life, while trying to track down a killer who's aptly named the &quot;Mastermind&quot;.<br />Patterson's style of writing short chapters make this a whirlwind of a read.  Rarely, do I find books that I literally &quot;can't put down&quot;, but there's no question that &quot;Roses..&quot; fits that category.<br />If you're new to the series, I would recommend that you start with &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot;, but even if you do start with &quot;Roses...&quot; you'll find it a terrific &quot;stand-alone&quot; read.  I can't wait for the next installment, &quot;Violets Are Blue&quot;!	2001-11-16

Jeff Rovin has succeeded in reproducing all the camp, scariness, and fun that the 1950's and 60's movies about Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Wolf Man contained.<br />I first stumbled on to Rovin by reading his excellent story of bats taking over the city of New York in &quot;Vespers&quot; (highly recommended).  Checking through the list of his books, I found &quot;Return of the Wolf Man&quot;.  After reading a number of the reviews listed here with Amazon, I decided to give the book a try.  I was not disappointed.  Rovin has captured all the pathos and anguish that Larry Talbot carries with him as the Wolf Man.  Just like in the movies the reader can't help but feel the conflicting emotions of sympathy and shock over Talbot's deeds as the Wolf Man.<br />Depictions of Count Dracula and Frankenstein's monster are true to legend and these monsters play active roles in this novel.  And, as with the Universal Pictures movies about these characters, this book doesn't really end, but rather fades away to where a sequel can later pick up the action.<br />Even if you weren't a fan of those old monster films, Rovin's story is strong enough to stand alone on it's own merits.  It has generous amounts of chills, surprises, and gore.  Characterization is somewhat weak, but Rovin makes up for this shortcoming with terrific story-telling and vivid word pictures.<br />&quot;Return of the Wolf Man&quot; is a solid page-turner and one book that horror fans won't be disappointed with !	2001-11-11

Sleek and stylish, &quot;Catch Me&quot; is a great follow-up to A.J. Holt's first book about FBI agent Jay Fletcher's attempt to rid the world of two very dispicable serial killers.  She did just that in &quot;Watch Me&quot; as she &quot;took out&quot; computer expert, Ricky Styles.  Now, in &quot;Catch Me&quot;, she attempts to track down and stop Styles' compatriot, the self-acclaimed son of Charles Manson, William Bonisteel, a.k.a &quot;Billy Bones&quot;.  Billy's connection to the Manson family is an interesting sidebar to the story.<br />Aided by US Marshall Jack Dane, Fletcher attempts to get to Billy before he gets to her.  She must do so as quickly as possible because Billy is leaving a trail of death and destruction as he teases Fletcher along to their inevitable final meeting. Invariably, Fletcher and Dane find themselves a step behind Billy as they try and decipher the clues that he leaves for them regarding his next victim.<br />And, while, Dane, Fletcher, and Billy are obviously the main players in this novel, Holt does a fine job adding some very interesting characters along the way.  It's this aspect of his writing that I think I appreciate the most.  Holt, in just his 2nd novel, has mastered the art of creating believable and interesting &quot;bit players&quot; that are critical to the plot and not just fluff through in to pad the story.<br />Some readers might find themselves appalled by the graphic descriptions of Billy's treatment of his victims.  In this writer's opinion, however, these scenes are more than gratuitous violence and are necessary to understand the character and mindset of Billy.<br />If you're a fan of this genre' and enjoy the works of authors like Thomas Harris, James Patterson, and Rex Miller, you'll find yourself enthralled by &quot;Catch Me&quot;.  Here's hoping that A.J. Holt will continue to evolve the character of Jay Fletcher and that we'll see another installment in the near future.	2001-10-28

It's a shame that it's catalogued as a work of &quot;science fiction&quot; because it is so much more than that.  I'm sure that many serious literary fans have failed to pick up on this teriffic book because of that &quot;tag&quot;.<br />The book has a tremendous &quot;hook&quot; line - that being, &quot;almost the entire human race is eradicated by a terrible catastrophe&quot;.  The plot is very believable and amazing when you consider that the novel was written in 1949.  Author George Stewart is a great storyteller and has created some very interesting characters.  The hero of this book, &quot;Ish&quot;, is both a &quot;superman&quot; and an &quot;everyman&quot;.  He is both the leader of his tribe, but also easily led.  His development as a person and as the head of his people is a wonderful progression throughout the book.  His wife, &quot;Em&quot; exhibits all the great characteristics of the strong woman behind the &quot;great man&quot;.  And, let me say that the symbolism of Ish's hammer was a very interesting facet of the book.<br />My only criticism (and it's a pretty minor one) is that the book did not go into enough detail regarding the disaster and how other people throughout the country were affected.  I think that this would have added some rich &quot;body&quot; to the storyline.<br />All things considered though, this indeed is a book for the ages.<br />It belongs with some of the best works of that era, such as &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot;, &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, and later &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. As an educator, I would really urge school officials to add this novel to their list of great American Literary selections for high school students.<br />But, do yourself a favor  - go to the library or your local bookstore get a copy of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; and delve into this great classic with its timeless message about the unshakeable human spirit!	2001-10-14

Doherty (a/k/a Bob Mayer) continues to weave a very imaginative and entralling story about the role that two warring alien cultures played in the development of life on planet Earth.<br />The protagionist of the series, Mike Turcotte, is his heroic and overall ornery self again in &quot;The Grail&quot;.  The other now-familar names to the fans of this series all play important parts again in this book.<br />In simple terms, let me say that fans of this series will not be disappointed!  If anything, &quot;The Grail&quot; is actually a stronger and consistently more entertaining read than the two previous &quot;Area 51&quot; novels - The Sphinx and The Mission.  The Grail recaptures a lot of the cameraderie and action of the first two books.<br />The &quot;Area 51&quot; is a book series that allows the reader great escapism.  The always-imaginative Doherty has done it again!	2001-10-12

Plenty of thrills, chills, gore, and hauntingly-vivid mental pictures abound for the ardent Laymon fan.  Unlike many horror authors who haphazardly throw in shocking scenes just for the thrill value, Laymon weaves his mayhem in the plot line like a master tailor.  Nothing is wasted and thorough characterization is always at the forefront of his novels.<br />&quot;Resurrection Dreams&quot; certainly defines &quot;good and evil&quot; early in the story.  &quot;Evil&quot; Melvin is equally pathetic and psychotic.  It's hard not to think back into one's past and not find a character Like Melvin that everybody in town hated but was also a little bit afraid of.  The protagonists of the story, Vicki and Ace, are both likeable and believable and it's hard not to get caught up in their fear of Melvin.<br />As with most Laymon plots, the reader can &quot;check his or her common sense and logic skills at the door&quot;.  But, is that really a problem for most Laymon fans?  Much of Laymon's appeal lies in his really bizarre plots (like this one). The avid Laymon reader knows what's in store for him or her BEFORE they pick up one of his books.<br />As with each of the Laymon books that I have read, he consistently delivers solid entertainment and escapism.  If you're looking for &quot;deep reading&quot; you won't find it in &quot;Resurrection Dreams.  But, on the other hand, if you're after a somewhat frightening and un-nerving good &quot;read&quot; then pick up a copy of this book.<br />If you like this book (and not everybody will - definitely not for the squeamish), then by all means try &quot;Funland&quot;, &quot;The Travelling Vampire Show&quot;,&quot;Midnight's Lair&quot; and &quot;The Beast House&quot; series. All of Laymon's books are hard to find (especially now that he has passed away) but they're well worth the effort!	2001-10-04

His outstanding first novel, &quot;Subterranean&quot;, gave us all a glimpse of his great promise.  Rollins' 2nd book, &quot;Excavation&quot;, while a &quot;slow starter&quot; picked up speed and turned out to be a satisfying read.<br />Unfortunately, none of the qualities of the first two books make it into his latest novel, &quot;Deep Fathom&quot;.<br />Expecting to find a book that I &quot;couldn't put down&quot;, I found instead a book that I had an extremely difficult time &quot;picking up&quot;!  Oh, the premise is interesting enough, (&quot;the first eclipse of the millenium uncovers a mysterious underworld city&quot;) but it loses steam fast.  The interesting characterization found in the book just can't carry a weak, uninteresting, and basically unbelievable plot.  The pace is tedious and there is too much talk and not enough action!<br />Rarely have I found a book that I looked so forward to reading that I was so disappointed with!<br />Here's hoping that Rollins regains the magic that he displayed in &quot;Subterranean&quot; and gives future efforts likes &quot;Deep Fathom&quot; the &quot;deep six&quot;!	2001-09-18

Why o' why do so-called literary experts take such delight in trashing Clive Cussler and his Dirk Pitt series? For those of us who are devoted fans, we're getting a little tired of all the bashing. Thousands of fans can't be wrong! &quot;Atlantis Found&quot;, while widely panned by the &quot;experts&quot;, will be a great addition to the &quot;Pitt collection&quot; for Cussler fans. Well, let me get off my soapbox long enough to give my impressions of another exciting, escapist trip with Dirk Pitt, Al, Admiral Sandecker and every one of the great characters that we've come to know and love! &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; is a throw-back, in a way, to some of Cussler's earlier works. The plot, albeit somewhat ultra-fantastic, is founded enough in factual data to be at least somewhat believable. And, as usual, great action, terrific villians and plenty of gadgets abound. Suspend your world of reality for a few hours and plan on a taking part in a fantastic journey to locations spanning the globe! If you haven't had the opportunity to read one of the novels from the Dirk Pitt series, this is probably a good place to start as any because, as mentioned earlier, almost every major &quot;player&quot; is part of this book. Perhaps not as strong an entry as &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot;, &quot;Deep Six&quot;, &quot;Pacific Vortex&quot; and &quot;Treasure&quot;, &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; will not disappoint Cussler fans (Back on my soapbox, let me say...) To Cussler critics everywhere - back off! For true fans of a great series, as long as Clive keeps writing &quot;them&quot; we'll keep buying them!	2001-08-28

The story remains the same and the plot (&quot;Mother searches relentlessly for son she believes is still alive&quot;) is easy to follow.  As with most Koontz books, there is the right amount of suspense, romance and humor.  He really IS a wonderful storyteller who is adept at creating believeable and likeable characters.<br />My only criticism is with the plot's dependancy on the paranormal to keep it going.  Telekinesis, hypnotism, and permonitions all play major roles in this novel.  I guess I would rather have seen a more &quot;reality-based&quot; plot.  I think the same story could have basically been told, but in a more believable manner.  On the other hand, if you're a true believer in the world of the paranormal, you'll absolutely love &quot;The Eyes of Darkness&quot;.<br />For those of you who are Koontz fans you'll no doubt find this another typical terrific &quot;read&quot;.  (If nothing else, it's an extremely quick read!)  For those of you trying Koontz for the first time, I would recommend some of his later, more polished works.  (&quot;Strangers&quot;, &quot;Watchers&quot;, &quot;Mr. Murder&quot;, and &quot;Shattered&quot; are just a few of his absolute best, in my humble opinion!)<br />Koontz remains one of the most reliable and prolific authors in our country today.  You know when you pick up one of his books it will be well-written with great characteriztion and a terrific story.  &quot;The Eyes of Darkness&quot; is no exception!	2001-08-12

The plot, (&quot;Cloned humans serving as replacement 'parts' for the rich and famous&quot;) which started with a great deal of promise, frizzled badly through the middle portion of the book.  It's not that the jargon or medical terminology was overwhelming, it's just that it was not very interesting!

This being my first venture into &quot;fictional history&quot;, I wasn't sure what to expect from this novel.  The premise (&quot;Cuban Missle Crisis Goes Horribly Wrong&quot;) piqued my interest enough when I saw this book on the shelf to give it a try.<br />I wasn't disappointed - especially after I slogged through the first 150 pages.  The protagionist of the story is a likeable and sympathetic enough character that you can't help not rooting for.  In addition, there are a number of &quot;nasties&quot; along the way that sometimes make it tough to figure out who's good and who's evil.  The &quot;plot&quot; has enough twists and turns to keep the reader guessing throughout the last half of the book.  And, I might add, is based on a believable enough premise that you'll &quot;thank your lucky stars&quot; things didn't work out this way back in the 60's.<br />I would have liked to have seen the real historical figures (Kennedy, Johnson, Cabinet officials, etc.) used more often in the novel to give the story more &quot;history&quot; and less &quot;fiction&quot;.  But, when they WERE used, it made for some of the better parts of the book. (Especially imaginative were the references to the candidates in the Presidential race that was taking place throughout the book.)<br />The novel is a little slow in spots and the romantic interlude involving our &quot;hero&quot; and the British journalist is uneven, at best.  On the other hand, DuBois IS a very good storyteller and many parts of this book shine.  (I think the average reader will certainly enjoy the trip to Manhatten Island.)<br />If you enjoy &quot;fact&quot; mixed in with &quot;fiction&quot;, then I don't think you'll be disappointed with &quot;Resurrection Day&quot;!	2001-07-26

As the son of a Marine Sargeant who fought in the Battles of Tawara, Saipan and Eniwetok, I was very interested to read &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot;, a view of the Battle of Iwo Jima (and others Pacific battles) written from the viewpoint of a son's chronicle of his father's exploits as a Marine corpsman.<br />Compared to what I have read in other books and from first-hand information given to me by my father, I believe that this is a well-researched book.  The reader is able to gather a real sense of what the War in the Pacific was like from the florid scenes of bloodshed and death.  The odd combination of fear, bravery, and fidelity that these men displayed during these tense times gives the reader a warm spot in the &quot;patriotic&quot; part of his/her heart.<br />The book is written primarily about the author's father, John, and the other five &quot;flagraisers&quot; of the American flag on top of Mount Suribachi during the Battle of Iwo Jima. Short overviews of how these men happened to come together at that fateful time add to human interest part of the book.  In addition, a few little known facts about the &quot;flagraising&quot; are included which help to make this a throughly enjoyable reading experience.<br />The problem that their notariety creates for the three surviving members of this elite group is well documented throughout the last quarter of the book.  Fame did not bring happiness to these three men!<br />Recommended for any WW II history buff or anyone interested in stories about victory of the human spirit.  This book is guaranteed to give you a few emotional tugs at your heart and make you feel glad to be an American.  Highly recommended!	2001-06-29

As the father of three mid- to late teens, I believe this book will be a great aid to young parents who have, or will soon be raising, the \\"middlers\\" (ages 10-15) that this book focuses on. My only regret is that I did not have the opportunity to read it when my children were beginning to move through this age group.<br />Had I read it earlier, I'm sure that it would have greatly improved my parenting skill because this book is practically a \\"how-to\\" manual for parents raising the 10-15 year-old child. Many, many topics are addressed by (what I feel, anyway) are two very readable and knowledgeable authors! Success in school, friendship & peer pressure, helping with the selection of appropriate media, drug and alcohol use, sexual awakening, and appearance anxiety are just some of the topics that are addressed in the book.<br />The book is a very fast \\"read\\" and is written in a light-hearted, yet informative manner. Humor and \\"street-talk\\" are used appropriately and effectively. The authors have certainly done their research and share a great deal of relevant and \\"eye-popping\\" survey material. Much of the material comes from the National Middle School Association, which also gives the book it \\"seal of approval\\".<br />I wholeheartedly recommend it to all parents who have children approaching those difficult high school years. You'll learn a lot of effective communication and parenting tricks which will make you a more effective parent, while at the same time making it easier for you and your \\"middler\\" to peacefully (and happily) progress through these trying 6 years! 5 stars!	2001-06-19

Like an earlier reviewer noted, &quot;The Traveling Vampire Show&quot; deals a lot more with the &quot;coming of age&quot; of a trio of teenagers than it does with vampires.  Comparable to a great book entitled &quot;Boys' Life&quot; by Robert McCammon, &quot;TTVS&quot; deals with the trials and tribulations involving the teens attempt to attend the &quot;adults only&quot; showing of the Traveling Vampire Show.<br />The trio of teens are presented with Laymon's adept way of getting you to know his &quot;characters&quot; without adding a lot of &quot;fluff&quot;.  It's easy to identify with the shy, but &quot;morally- correct&quot; Dwight, the tomboyish and heroic Slim, and the immature and identity-searching Rusty.<br />Laymon's tight writing and ability to weave a couple of plot lines together, makes this a thoroughly enjoyable journey. Throw in Laymon's signature sets of gratitous violence and sex, and you're got a typical Laymon &quot;read&quot;.  As a matter of fact, in this reviewer's opinion, this novel ranks among his best (Midnight's Lair, The Stake, and Funland).  If this is your first Laymon book, you will not be disappointed and will, most likely, become a fan for life.<br />Unfortunately, Laymon's untimely death in February has taken a terrific author from among the literary ranks.  His legion of fans will sorely miss his &quot;over-the-top&quot; style of writing, but collectors of his fiction will have a field day.  Enjoy!	2001-06-03

Koontz has always been great at character development and creating gut-churning suspenseful plots, but with &quot;Icebound&quot;, he came up about 25 blocks short of an igloo.<br />Granted, it was a quick read, but very predictable and basically lifeless.  The characters were tough to like and even harder to figure out at times.  What's the deal with George Lin, anyway?  And, way too much time was spent dissecting the problems of the Russian submarine commander.<br />Hopefully, this won't be your first venture into the world of Dean Koontz because the man is a great writer!  Dont' let this book stop you from reading some of his &quot;classics&quot;.  The list is long, but I definitely recommend &quot;Watchers&quot;, &quot;Strangers&quot; (The Dean Koontz version of &quot;The Stand&quot;), &quot;Mr. Murder&quot;, &quot;Shattered&quot; &quot;Whispers&quot; and &quot;The Servants of Twilight&quot;.

It was a great literary work that had me on the edge of my seat for days.  &quot;Footfall&quot;, on the other hand, left me wishing that I had spent my time doing something more productive - like starting a different book!<br />I really tried to get into this book, but the confusing plot, not to mention trying to understand just what in the hell was going on with the aliens half the time, really left me scratching my head.  It was hard enough to keep up with the dozens of characters in the book, let alone trying to figure out what the &quot;snouts&quot; were attempting to say.  I think I wore out the pages in the front of the book that listed the cast of characters from having to turn back and forth so many times just to keep a handle on &quot;who was who&quot;.<br />Oh, I know that the vast majority of people who have reviewed &quot;Footfall&quot; have raved about it, but for my money, stick to the aforementioned &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot;, George Stewart's wonderful, &quot;Earth Abides&quot;, anything by Michael Reisig (&quot;The New Madrid Run&quot; is outstanding), or Robert McCammon's &quot;Swan Song&quot; if you want a little escapism in your life.	2001-05-12

If you want a book that's well-researched, has good characterization, and has a great hook-line...Giant bats and their buddies taking over New York... then, by all means, pick up a copy of &quot;Vespers&quot;!  I'd give it 4 and 1/2 stars, but Amazon.com does not permit that kind of rating.<br />This was the first book that I've read by Jeff Rovin, but it won't be my last.  He's a very good story-teller who's done his homework.  &quot;Vespers&quot; contains great action, a descriptive tour of New York and a lot of information about bats that I'm sure most people never knew before. The story nevers bogs down because Rovin skillfully weaves a number of little sub-plots throughout the book.<br />Not one to give away much of the plot, let me just say that the story is set in present-day and contains more than a few unnerving scenes of violence.  Giant bats have begun to breed and multiply after an accident involving radiation affects the growth pattern of one of the bats.  A gutsy &quot;batologist&quot; and a brave detective are all that stand between New York and annihilation.<br />This is a very quick read and is great escapism.  I heartedly recommend it to those who grew up when the great old &quot;B&quot; movies of the 50's and 60's told of man's encounters with radioactive ants (&quot;Them&quot;), 8-foot tall &quot;carrot-men&quot; from another world (&quot;The Thing&quot;) and giant Japanese monsters (Godzilla).	2001-04-01

Alright...it's not the most believable premise. (believeable, hell!; this ranks right up there with &quot;there's no travelling in the NBA&quot;,  the Alien Autopsy, and &quot;I'll still respect you in the morning...&quot;) On the other hand, if you like over-the-top &quot;Indiana Jones-type&quot; adventure stories, then you'll find this book very entertaining.<br />Character development is a little weak and in most cases, it's really hard to feel very close to &quot;our heroes&quot;, but besides that and believability, those are the only major flaws in this book.  I've got to admit that once I finally got into the story, this was a hard book to put down.<br />I'm not big on giving too much of the plot line away in these reviews because I hate it when somebody does that.  So, suffice it to say, Rollins does a nice job keeping two plots lines going and tying them together at the end of the book. There's a lot of action in the last 300 pages and it's easy to pick out the &quot;bad&quot; guys in this book -  a group who's usually not thought of as being &quot;bad&quot; guys, I might add!  (I'm sure this won't be on the Pope's reading list.)<br />If you liked Rollins' first novel, &quot;Subterranean&quot;, or if you enjoyed &quot;Neanderthal&quot; and the &quot;Relic&quot; books, you'll probably really enjoy &quot;Excavation&quot; as well.  And, like a lot of novelists these days, the &quot;door&quot; is left open at the end of this book for a sequel.  I smell &quot;mini-series&quot;!	2001-03-28

DeMille and Block have collaborated on a surprising fresh and tautly written airline disaster that takes the reader (literally) to new heights.  Set on a &quot;Concorde-like&quot; supersonic transport that flies in subspace, the authors take us on a very scary ride with an amateur pilot, courageous &quot;stew&quot;, and rather enlightened child.<br />As if our &quot;heroes&quot; didn't have enough problems with the plane, they're also up against a variety of organizations and/or individuals who are out to coverup the disaster and going to great lengths to do just that.  Throw in 200 or so VERY uncooperative passengers and you've got the making of a great story!  (Think &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; meets &quot;Airport&quot;.)<br />But, I really don't want to give away much of the plot because this book is really worth your time!  Guaranteed to make you think twice the next time you board a plane!<br />The only reason that this is a 4-star, instead of 5-star offering is due to the somewhat predictable (yet not altogether unsatisfying) ending.  Far superior to most airline disaster novels, &quot;Mayday&quot; is a fine book and merits your attention.	2001-03-06

It is a moderately interesting tale about a number of misguided characters.  A variety of personalities are introduced stretching from a TV anchorman searching for his lost &quot;touch&quot; to a doctor who's once honorable intentions have turned horribly wrong to a woman trying to regain what's left of her pride and dignity.<br />This is not a book for the faint of heart.  It has many scenes containing gratuitous violence and sex.  It's even hard to root for any of the characters because of their many flaws and foibles. Some are really dispicable!  (How about a 500-pound deputy sheriff who as warped as last year's plywood?)  Perhaps the most honorable individual is the most misunderstood person of all - the dwarf who lives in the woods.<br />Sounds bizarre?  It definitely is!  I can't say that I disliked the book because it was action-filled.  It's just that it was so uneven and predictable in places, especially in the final scene. But, don't take my word for it.  If you like strange stories, with a LOT of strange people, you'll probably really &quot;go&quot; for this tale.<br />For a better effort by David Martin, however, I enthusiastically recommend his book, &quot;Tap, Tap&quot;.	2001-03-02

For UFOlogists and Roswell fanatics, there's nothing really new here.  Don't read MAJESTIC with the idea that you're going to find out anything that you don't already know.  On the other hand, if the reader knows absolutely nothing about the Roswell crash (and then that begs the question, &quot;where have you been for the past 10 years?&quot;) then you might enjoy using this book as some sort of a reference.  This is the only reason that it gets 2 stars instead of one star.<br />MAJESTIC is described as fiction based on fact and boy is that stretching it!  Based on the recollections of Will Stone, &quot;THE&quot; guy involved with the Roswell investigation, Strieber tries to cover the story in a journalistic way, but can't help throwing in sensational sidebars which include alien/human sexual encounters and the little buggy-eyed guys creeping at the foot of people's beds.<br />The Stone character supposedly was on the inside of the whole investigation and lets us in on such &quot;secrets&quot; as how the rancher who discovered the crash was discredited, how President Truman was talked into the approving the creation of MAJIC, and what  the sinister reason was behind the aliens' visitations. Wow, like we haven't heard all of this before.<br />MAJESTIC just nevers takes off.  I didn't really learn anything new about the conspiracy (the factual part) and I really didn't care about the characters (the fictional part).  And, why were some of the names changed (to protect the innocent, no doubt) and others not?  The best part of the whole book was the torrid Bess and Harry Truman love scene.  Sorry, just kidding!<br />This is the 2nd (and last) book that I've read by Strieber.  His writing style and my reading style just don't match up.  I think he's hard to follow and his characterization (whether based in fact or fiction) is weak. I think he's a frustrated journalist who's trying to be a great writer of fiction.  Ain't goin'  happen !  Stick to the real world, Whitley, and you'll make all of us (and the aliens) happy!in'  happen !

As other authors have done, or had done for them, (see Dean Koontz and Stephen King), Clive Cussler has put together an encyclopedia, if you will, of everything you've wanted to know about the Dirk Pitt series.  Cussler has included synopses and character &quot;i.d.'s&quot; from every Dirk Pitt novel, up to &quot;Atlantis Found&quot;. A prologue to &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; is even included. You'll also enjoy the sections on the Cussler car collection and Dirk Pitt trivia. If you are a long-time fan like I am and occasionally re-read some of the Pitt novels, then this compendium is for you.  I would even recommend it to those just beginning the journey through the Pitt novels.  Anyway you slice it, if you buy this book you will want to hang on to it and use if for reference from time to time.	2001-01-22
US	52840188	R1G9VXJUBKSVKN	0060931396	313139072	Alas, Babylon (Perennial Classics)	Books	5	5	7	N	N	A true classic!	&quot;Alas, Babylon&quot;, written over 40 years ago, is as fresh and frightening now as it was then. Because it has stood the test of time and &quot;reads&quot; as well for the first generation of the 21st Century as it did for the Cold War generation, it has my seal of approval as a true classic.  The characterization is excellent and believable.  You really find yourself pulling for these people. The book is well-researched and militarily accurate.  It is obvious that the author, Pat Frank, really did his homework. As the true &quot;granddad&quot; of the apocalyptic genre', &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot; set the stage for later works in this area, such as, &quot;The Stand&quot;, &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; and &quot;Warday&quot;.  And, by the way, does anyone else find it coincidental that the protagionist in this book was named Randy Bragg, yet the villain in &quot;The Stand&quot; was named Randall Flagg?  I think Stephen King liked this book as well! Highly recommended; you'll find yourself wishing that it wasn't over so quickly!	2001-01-21

Get the UK version if at all possible because it has 500 pages, not the 390+ that other versions have.  You don't want to miss any of the action in this novel. The sleepy tourist trap of a town called Boleta Bay will never be the same when some of the local kids declare &quot;war&quot; on the  indigents and derelicts (called &quot;trolls&quot;) that are terrorizing the citizens and visitors to the town.  Laymon's characterization is terrific and you find yourself with mixed emotions about the leading characters.  Many twists and turns are part of a fairly diverse plot that rockets to a roller-coaster of an ending.  You'll find yourself wishing that there were 500 more pages of this book when you finish! This book is not for the fate of heart or those that are offended by the gore and violence that are a staple of Laymon's writing.  But, on the other hand, if you like great storytelling with great characters, by all means pick this book (or any of Laymon's work) and settle in for a long night.	2001-01-13

The character development was good and you really will begin to feel for these people and the situation that they're in.  My only complaint is that the book is too short.  I wanted it to go on much longer.  I hope that there is a &quot;New Madrid Run, Part 2&quot; in the works!	2000-12-27

As a fan of the medical thrillers from the keyboards of writers F. Paul Wilson, Michael Crichton, and Robin Cook, I wasn't really expecting much from this &quot;unknown&quot;.  Boy, was I pleasantly suprised!  Life Form is better than anything that Cook has done and is in the same league with Wilson and Crichton.<br />A small New Hampshire town is losing inhabitants to a mysterious disease that only affects them when they leave town for an extended period.  No one seems to see any connection until a local school teacher loses his best friend to the mystery ailment.  He then spends a considerable amount of time, energy and money to get to the bottom of the mystery.  What he finds along the way is more than he's bargained for and almost costs him his job and life.<br />You won't be disappointed Life Form if you like medical thrillers that have a variety of plot twists.  My only wish was that it hadn't ended so soon!	2000-10-15

This is one book that, albeit it, borders on being totally unbelievable (as opposed to just &quot;unbelievable&quot; as most of Koontz' works are) is a one-sitting,  &quot;betcha-can't-read-just-one-page&quot; fun read.<br />My only warning  is not to use this as  your first Koontz selection.  I think he did  &quot;TickTock&quot; more for laughs (and to recover his own sanity) than  for critical acclaim.  Start with any of his earliest works and you'll be a  fan for life.  &quot;Watchers&quot;, &quot;Strangers&quot;,  &quot;Whispers&quot;, and &quot;Shattered&quot; are great  first-choices.<br />Back to &quot;TickTock&quot; though.

Like many of the reviewers before me, I too, am very disappointed with JG's latest effort.(and I might add that I am a big fan who has read every one of his books)  While it is subject matter that deserves attention, I'm  not sure that this is the forum that should be chosen.  The novel plods  along (after a rather exciting beginning) and never really picks up speed.  The ending is too predictable and it's easier to feel sorrow for the main  character than admiration!  Unfortunately, both The Partner and this novel  make me wonder if JG should consider going back to his &quot;roots&quot;  and return to courtroom drama.  I wouldn't recom mending spending your  hard-earned dollars for this lemon... check it out from the library (and  ask for 4 weeks... it may take you that long to wade through it).	1998-10-28

It's an interesting look at &quot;what if...&quot; Manson's followers rose again and somehow freed him to roam and terrorize the countryside once more.  The main characters are believeable, but not sympathetic enough to really root for in this novel.  I give Perry credit for some imaginative research and development with his book, however.  A somewhat predictable ending help to keep this from being a really top-notch thriller.	1998-01-02

My excitement about reading something different from Robin Cook was soon diminished after about 50 pages of &quot;Invasion&quot;.  It's too bad that the crew from &quot;Mystery Science Theater&quot; can't lampoon books because they would have a field day with this tepid attempt at sci-fi.  Hopefully, Dr. Cook will stick with the subject matter that he knows best - the medical thriller.  If you're looking for a good Robin Cook book to read, don't start with this one.

I never thought I could read (let alone re-read) a 1100+ page book, but it was no problem with this GREAT book by Stephen King.  You should definitely read the uncut version to get all that King intended for this book to be - a look at our (possible) future, how good ultimately triumphs over evil, and how a better world may be in store for mankind! (The extra 500 pages in this version do make a difference!) Almost every character-type imaginable is present in this story and it's easy to identify with them all.  A close second (and I do mean close) to this book is Robert McCammon's &quot;Swan Song&quot;.  Similar storyline, but in some ways even more engrossing!  You won't be disapponted by either novel!	1997-12-23

I sometimes feel like I should be wrapping the covers of his books in newspaper, but that doesn't stop me from devouring his novels. And he doesn't disappoint me or the fan of the &quot;thrill-a- minute, don't-look-around-the-next-corner&quot; genre of horror novels with this product. While the premise of the novel is a little unbelieveable, it does take off faster than a rap singer booked on the Lawrence Welk show.  After a few pages, you begin to feel the same suffocating paranoia that those trapped in the cave are dealing with.  Character development is good and it's easy to single out the good from the evil.  This book is a quick-read and you won't be disappointed if gore and shocks are your thing.(Just don't eat while you're reading it!)  Laymon has the ability to latch on to a storyline and wring every thrill he can out of it like a terrier playing tug-of-war with you.  His books are consistently as scary as Stephen King's and often times deliver more chills than Dean Koontz'.  Try &quot;The Stake&quot; and &quot;The Woods are Dark&quot; for other good efforts by Laymon.	1997-12-23
