US	45703294	RGOK1XIZB4O4Y	0374309264	309963434	Boy2Girl	Books	4	4	6	N	N	A funny book with a unique point of view	Matt is your typical thirteen year-old British boy, whose life is shaken up by the arrival of his American cousin, Sam.  Sam's mother has recently died and with his father presumed to be in jail Sam is understandably angry at his life.  This anger causes Matt's group of friends, who call themselves the Sheds, to reject Sam.  In order to regain their acceptance Sam agrees to a dare of having him dress as a girl for the first week of school so that Sam can spy on a group of girls who are the Shed's enemies.  Sam proves to be remarkably successful in his role as a girl.  Primarily using humor, Blacker successfully examines gender roles through such situations as Sam receiving a training bra, or teaching the girls how to intimidate a boy by looking at him.  Blacker chooses to use multiple narrators, some who only narrate for a paragraph, to further show how the same event can be interpreted in different ways.  This style could easily have been a gimmick, but instead works remarkably well in furthering the story and the humor.  The book's madcap conclusion, involving Sam's dad who has returned in order to get Sam, and the previously unknown riches left to him, will leave readers smiling, but also thinking more about how boys and girls really act, and how those actions are perceived.	2005-08-02

Told through the eyes of Peter Parker, the story will be familiar, but different to fans of the movies.  What truly sets this book apart are the beautiful photographs used to tell the story.  With multiple pictures on each page it truly feels like a comic book brought to life.	2004-08-07

His twin seems to always be just a little bit better, while Koji feels he can't seem to do anything right.  When his twin saves a rich merchant's life, Koji is surprised when his parents choose him to become the apprentice.   After failing with the merchant, Koji runs away only to be captured by Ninjas, or, as they call themselves, blades of grass.  The book begins somewhat slowly and focuses heavily on the culture of Ninjas, so it will not appeal to readers who wish for constant action.  It is however very strong historical fiction and will leave the reader knowing far more about the fascinating world of Ninjas.	2004-07-12

Eragon becomes the first Dragon Rider, a position of extreme importance and power, in a hundred years.  When he is forced to flee the village he does so with Bram, the local story teller.  Adventure and trouble awaits as Eragon learns more about his powers and the dangerous situation swirling all around him.  This book is in the first in a trilogy and the somewhat abrupt ending might leave readers a bit frustrated, if wanting more.<br />This book suffers from somewhat pedantic writing, but listeners of the audio will never know it.  Doyle's narration is among the best I have ever heard.  His deep voice, evoking the finest of English performers, is remarkably versatile as each of the characters has an immediately recognizable, and appropriate, voice.  Doyle's narration is highly recommended for any, especially those well read in fantasy, who want to see what all the fuss is about with this bestselling book.	2004-07-12

Charlie knows that his parents do important work, but never imagines that anyone would want to harm them, until he comes home one day and discovers them kidnapped.  Charlie runs away from his parents kidnappers and sets out to find his parents.  With major parts of the book taking place on a floating circus, the streets of Paris, and aboard a train, the book has numerous delightful subplots while never losing focus of Charlie's overall goal.

Either an homage or a ripoff of Harry Potter (depending on how much you like the book), Midnight for Charlie Bone follows Charlie as he discovers his \\"endowment\\": the ability to listen to what was being said as photographs are taken.  This supposed gift causes the sinister Yewbeams to enter Charlie's life.  When Charlie is sent to Bloor's Academy he soon finds all is not well.  Considerably darker than Harry Potter, the book introduces a large cast of characters some of whom will no doubt play larger parts in the books to come.  Lacking much of the majesty and sense of a well thoughtout world that give Harry Potter so much of its charm, many Harry fans will no doubt like the many similarities, and some will no doubt like the darker tone of this book.  <br />The narration on the audiobook can be hard to understand at times, but the narrator does a mostly good job of breathing life and personality into each of the characters.	2004-06-05

This boy who loves not only words, and their power, but the sound of his own voice has gone mute.  Accused of dropping his sister, Branwell, or Bran, has been taken into custody.  Branwell's best friend Connor takes it upon himself to find out what happened on that fateful day, convinced that this will allow his friend to start talking again.  Alternating between flashback and present day events Connor is a likable, but admittedly not perfect, narrator.  Konigsburg does an excellent job of tackling some of the deep and powerful issues revolving around adolescence in a serious manner, but avoids making the book feel like a downer.  Through his investigation Connor discovers as many things about himself as he does about Bran leading to a satisfying conclusion.<br />McGillin does an a mostly good job of giving each of the characters a distinct voice, and especially, and surprisingly so, with the female characters.  His narration makes for easy listening and adds definite value to the already very good book.	2004-06-05

Taking place over the course of the school year, Melinda slowly begins to reveal what happened at the fateful party.  This leads to a revelation that by design is anti-climatic as Melinda finally can begin to cope with her trauma.  Anderson's prose accurately dissects the many inanities of high school, and gives us a protagonist who we like and root for, even when she doesn't like or root for herself.  This is a serious book that provides no easy answers, just as one would hope, and leads to a satisfying, but hardly happy, ending.<br />Siegfried's narration displays the requisite malaise you would expect from Melinda's first person narration.  While this reading is faithful to the book it can make for dreary listening at times and thus might be one to read instead of listen to.	2004-06-05

When her sister enters rehab and her mother decides to \\"recuperate\\" in Europa, Anna Percy decides that she does not want to live in New York by herself.  Instead she decides to move in with her father, who left the family many years ago.  On the plane she meets Ben Birenbaum, a freshman at Princeton.  When the two hit it off, Ben invites Anna to the wedding of Jackson Sharpe (Oscar Winning Actor) where Ann is introduce to the eponymous A-List: Sam, who is insecure about her looks and has a celebrity psychologist on speed dial, Dee, the nice one, and Cammie, who derives pleasure from being cruel and sexually promiscuous.   The A-List all share a secret: they are in love with Ben.  The fact that Anna is nothing like them, nave and yet sophisticated, gorgeous, and seems to have captured Ben's heart earns her the A-List's animosity.  In a book that is full of stock characters, Dean does a good job of adding shades of gray to her characterizations making even the least likable of characters at least understandable.  Indeed the book is perhaps over populated with characters leaving the reader wanting to see more of interesting, but largely ignored, characters.  In the end the only character who comes off as flat is Ben himself which makes it harder to understand how he can make so many girls' hearts go aflutter.  The casual use of drugs and alcohol, not to mention numerous sexual encounters show a culture where adult oversight is absent and will either attract or repulse readers to the lifestyle of the A-List.  The book's ending will likely provoke different reactions from different readers and sets things up quite nicely for a sequel.	2004-02-05

When Daniel returns to the Thompson household after running away seven years previously at fifteen, Shadow's life is forced to radically change for the second time.  Shadow, named because of the way he used to follow his brother around, has enough going on in his life as he begins High School, and things are further strained in the Thompson household by the fact that Daniel has been accused of murder.  With Shadow, his mother and father, each reacting in different ways to Daniel's return Rottman vividly portrays the intense, and sometimes contradictory, emotional journey that the stress of Daniel's return causes on each of the four family members.  Teenagers will be able to relate to Shadow's excellent narration.  For a book that does an excellent job of examining an emotionally complex issue, readers might be frustrated with the ending, which too neatly resolves some conflicts while intentionally leaving other issues unresolved.	2004-02-05

Telling the tale of a mystical island in the Northwest, this book fails to integrate a sports story, fantasy/tall tale of the Holes variety, with that of a family drama.  There is superior work in each genre and the interested young reader should turn their attention to the superior and more accessible books found with-in those genres.

Joey Pigza is an extremely hyperactive 5th Grade boy.  As he says to start the book \\"At school they say I'm wired bad, or wired mad, or wired sad, or wired glad, depending on my mood and what teacher has ended up with me.  But there is no doubt about it, I'm wired\\".  Through Gantos' deft storytelling, with Joey acting as our narrator, we are quickly taken into Joey's world.  Joey's world isn't one that most of us would like to be a part of for very long.  Joey has, up until the time we met him, lived in a world punctuated by two things.  The fact that he is a wired, or in other words suffering from an extreme case of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and a home life that involves a grandmother taking care of Joey, whose parents are AWOL, who in her own wired way is rather abusive towards Joey.  Joey's life changes though with the return of his mother, which causes Joey's grandmother to leave.  Joey's mother is a far more together person and is committed to trying to help Joey get better.  However, Joey's ADHD causes him to get into ever more destructive situations that culminates in Joey accidentally maiming a girl's nose.  With Joey describing the situation, if the reader reads quickly enough, it is quite possible for Joey's ridiculous decisions to make sense.  Upon any sort of reflection Joey's decisions look ridiculous, but the fact that Gantos can make the reader understand why Joey acts the way he does is a large part of what makes this an excellent book.  After reaching rock bottom Joey is sent to a special school where Joey's desire to not act that way is met with people who can help him get better.  And slowly, and not without the occasional set back, Joey with the help of his case worker, \\"Special Ed\\", Joey is put on medication that works and he learns to make good decisions.  The book ends with one of life's little triumphs as Joey is allowed to leave the Special Education school and return to his normal school.  While not everything is OK things are look pretty good for Joey.  This sums up the true triumph of Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key.  The book manages to capture the shades of grey that are almost always missing from children's book.  Joey is an astute 5th grader, but he is still a 5th grader and so sometimes there are just things he doesn't understand, unlike other children's books where the children appear to be nothing short of clairvoyant.  This is a book that is fun to read while being so much more.  I highly recommend this book.ucation school and return to his normal school.
