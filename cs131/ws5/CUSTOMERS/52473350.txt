History teacher Barbara Covell doesn't have much of a life of her own. Although she'd never admit it, she is desperately lonely. But then relatively bohemian Sheba Hart joins the staff at her school and befriends her. <br /> <br />But Sheba is not an innocent... she is found having an affair with one of her underage pupils. But even then Barbara is willing to accept that Sheba is simply nave and takes it upon herself to take control and stand up for her friend. She wants to be the ultimate friend in need ... why can't Sheba appreciate that? Why won't she simply let her take over and make everything right? Why is she once again being scorned?  <br /> <br />This is a story of hidden agendas, ulterior motives, malice and of `friendship' turning into obsession. It is dark, chilling, well-paced and hard to put down. <br />	2005-07-20

I'm a fan of Maggie O'Farrell's and was really looking forward to reading this. O'Farrell has always been about love, but love with a twist of melancholy. In this book, classic romance creeps in a big way and ... for me, part the thrill has gone [soft] for it.   <br /> <br />The characters in \\"The distance between us\\" are not as involving and her writing is a lot less dark, losing some of its bite in the process.  <br /> <br />In summary, this book is still a pretty good read, but it doesn't pack the same punch as some of her previous work (e.g. this is nowhere near as hard hitting as \\"After You'd Gone). <br />	2005-07-20

That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I can't help but compare it to \\"Best of the Classics\\" type CDs containing excerpts of classical music which have become `semi-hits' through featuring in TV ads.  <br /> <br />How you feel about this book will then largely depend on how you feel about this popularization of was once believed to be culture intended exclusive for the intelligentia. <br /> <br />I've never had any interest in really studying philosophy, so this was a good introduction to some of philosophy's Greats for me, but the book only skims the surface of each. Anyone with a real interest in a particular philosopher or philosophy in general will certainly need to dig deeper. Having said that, this book could be a good starting point - I have highlighted some passages in my copy as cues for further reading. <br /> <br />As to whether this book can serve as \\"consolation\\" or help in dealing with \\"the problems of everyday life\\" I'd have to say that my jury's still out.  <br /> <br />	2005-07-20

Alex Orlando is a Californian house-sitting for her uncle in New York while he's on vacation. Despite her uncle's warning, she has a fling with her (slightly odd) foreign neighbor, Christian, just a day before the man she's been in love with comes to visit.  <br />In the meantime, her `oldest friend', Kyle, who is now living in New York, is obviously involved in something unsavory and is very close to going over the edge. <br />Then, she finds Christian murdered and New York suddenly starts to feel like a far less welcoming place. <br /> <br />Though it may sound confusing the story is very well-told and these seemingly unrelated and incompatible characters intertwine seamlessly in the absorbing plot. <br />The ending was a bit of a give-away but a good read nonetheless.	2005-03-20

Thankfully, this was rather secondary to the storyline and only minimally damaged my enjoyment of the book, but more committed feminists beware!   <br />	2005-03-07

Think they'll cope? I doubt it. Actual warfare will probably hurt their feelings, damage their self esteem, and diminish their immediate experience of happiness - all the values we hold most dear.

Although I didn't fall in love with this book on first sight, it has grown on me over time and it's now both my and my son's favourite bedtime read. <br />Its simple rhyme and illustration was an immediate hit with my toddler, and as the text is so minimal in relation to the pictures there's lots to look at (and say goodnight to!) and a new story to tell every night. <br />No wonder it's a classic! <br />	2005-01-13

I bought this book for my son when he was a baby, and now at 21 months, I wouldn't say it's one of his favourites.  <br />He did show some interest at first - the lift-the-flap yes/no eggs were a huge hit (and are looking rather worse-for-wear for it!) but not many of the touchy-feely animals impressed him. <br />I, on the other hand, love this book. The pictures are fabulous, the textures are great and varied, and the duck's tummy really is incredibly soft!  <br />	2005-01-13

Although well-written, it is almost self-consciously so, so that it doesn't let you flow with it, and although witty (in an ironic / sarcastic way) and funny in parts, it doesn't really allow you to laugh with it, as the overall feeling is rather sad. <br /> <br />This is not a book you'll regret reading, but it was a bit too melancholy for my liking, and definitely not up to the expectations I'd built up based on his previous boks. <br />	2005-01-13

I got this book due to the excellent reviews it was getting and was not aware I was getting a book of poetry at the time. <br /> <br />The book is all about confidence, awareness, self-worth, and forgiveness. I may well have appreciated it more if I was going through a more stressed or depressed time of my life, but as it was, I thought it was a bit elementary and repetitive. <br /> <br />I think this book will make the perfect present for a teenage daughter or niece, or a female friend going through a rough patch. Certainly, every woman will find at least one poem she'll be able to relate to. <br /> <br />However, when I next need a book to inspire me or make me feel better, I'll go back to my all-time favourites: `Jonathan Livingston Seagull' or `The Alchemist' <br />	2004-11-02

The characters and the writing style made it a worthwhile read, but overall was a bit too disconnected from its cruelty for my liking. <br /> <br />For truly excellent `cruel and unusual' writing, I would recommend Patrick Suskind's `Perfume' instead. <br />	2004-10-27

It is about the limits set upon us by our upbringing, or by ourselves, and the dilemma of whether to `blow it all sky high' for love .. or not. <br /> <br />Well-written, witty, well-paced, but I thought the was ending a bit abrupt and weak compared to the rest of the book.  <br /> <br />Though maybe not all that likeable in her own right, I found myself feeling very sympathetic towards the heroine, Dilys, and I feel that every reader will find there's a part of Dilys they'll be able to relate to.  <br /> <br />Looking forward to reading more from Mavis Cheek. <br />	2004-10-21

I was first introduced to Ariel Gore through her `Hip Mama' books, and loved her irreverent outlook on parenthood, which was just what I needed after juggling mommy duties and a job on very little sleep.  <br /> <br />This book is about her travel days as a student, and although it's well-written, it was a little too rough for me. An interesting read, but I couldn't fully relate to it... I would have given it 3 and a half stars if I could, as I really can't make up my mind about this book.  <br />	2004-10-05

I've read all her work and find her style of writing absolutely delicious. <br /> <br />In this book, she tells the story of a woman who tries to break away from her past by joining in a monastery in rural France, though her philosophy is much more gypsy than Christian.  <br /> <br />This book is darker and more dramatic than her previous work, but once again, the characters are both compelling and well-drawn, and the plot is unpredictable and captivating. <br /> <br />Short chapters and a flowing storyline make it very easy to read - in fact, I didn't like having to take a break from it and ended up staying up very late one night to finish it.  <br /> <br />All in all it's a good book, but it's not quite Chocolat.  <br />	2004-10-05

This is a story written through the eyes of a mildly autistic boy who is trying to solve the mystery of the neighbour's dog murder, and stumbles into a number of other `revelations' on the way. <br /> <br />The book is both moving and funny (in both a laugh-out-loud and a sad kind of way) with an original plot and simple but flowing language, which makes it very easy to read in one sitting.  <br /> <br />Seeing life from Christopher's `simplified' and inherently logical point-of-view was a real eye-opener for me. And although that's not the purpose of the book, I think that every parent can benefit from this `inside' view of a child's mind. <br /> <br />Though it's probably not one of those books that will stay with me for life, it's well worth reading. <br />	2004-10-05

This book is about Harry Silver, who following the failure of his first marriage, is trying to build a new `blended' family for him and his son.  <br /> <br />This situation is so common nowadays that it should make for pretty boring material... right?  <br />Not so. Tony Parsons is so good at deconstructing feelings that this book is a joy to read. <br /> <br />Parsons' documentation of a Harry's love for his son and his indecision over a faltering relationship, is moving without being sentimental. <br /> <br />Harry Silver is no angel, but I found him to be immensely likeable none-the-less. Even when he's failing, the right intentions are there, and I couldn't help but sympathise.  <br />- Harry only wants what's best for his son ... don't we all?  <br />- Harry just wants the newness of falling in love to last forever ... wouldn't we all?  <br /> <br />This book not only realistically tackles the dynamics of modern family relationships (children, parents, and spouses - current and ex), but is also surprisingly tender in addressing the unconditional and endless love one can only truly feel for their children.  <br /> <br />This book really struck a chord with me -  <br />Mr. Parsons, I can't thank you enough for writing it. <br />	2004-10-05
