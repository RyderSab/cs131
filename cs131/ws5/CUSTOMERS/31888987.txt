I read one of her historicals thought it was pretty good. This is way better, in my opinion. I really liked Reece. He was a perfect hero. He came across as human and still a good guy. Not those ones who are so perfect they are too perfect to be believable. Kara, well I liked her too, I just didnt agree with some of the things she did. That falls into more personal tastes. I just didnt like some of the choices she made, little things that. So that is my personal taste, not an opinion on the story itself.  <br />The story all together was great. We had an idea of where the bad guy was, but we didnt know exactly who or where they were on the ladder. Not the best who done it, but enough to keep you entertained and guessing a little. There was plenty of action, good lovescenes. Purple jiggle stick, lol, was great. I liked her son, I didnt think he was in enough of the book though. I thought it was great when Kara snapped on her boss Tom. The book was also funny. It was a strong novel that had humor, a good story line and good characters.  <br />I thought this book was great and would recommend it to romance readers all over. Enjoy!!	2005-10-03

I did have quite a story built up in my head. It didnt excede my expectations, but it was close. The tension between Adam and Gabby came off the pages. It did slow down at the time when I thought it should take off and show how sensual Adam is. Ah, but that is ok. This was still an amazing story. Considering I waited for the paper back, almost two years by the way and ended up forgetting the rest of the series because it took so long to get the paperback out. That was my biggest problem with the book, that it took an extra year for it to publish. I almost didnt get it. But I stayed true, and will wait probally another two years for the next one that just came out.  <br />This was a lighter tale that fits in the series well. We get to visit the brothers again, who are just as yummy and the tale continues. We are brought back to beautiful Scotland in another beautiful castle with the hot brothers. We got to learn more about the Fae and it opened up a few new avenues for new story lines.  <br />I enjoyed this book a lot and would recommend it to everyone.	2005-09-28

Not the best name wither for a hero if you ask me but he wasnt all that bad. Unfortunetly, he doesnt do an about face with his attitude until literally the end of the book, like page 455. But it is not like you cant tell his feelings for her are changing up until there. They do, but he just fights it till the end. He was quite the jack*** for a portion of the book, and she was pretty powerless. The book is set in 1100's, and women had alot less power then than even in most historicals set in the 1800's  <br />But considering the time period, he was really not all that bad. Ariane stood up for herself as much as she could.  <br />Overall, I liked the book. There were a few elements that I did not agree with, such as his bastards. That was a little disturbing. But I just chalked it up to the time period and even less birth contol and moved on. It was a good story, kept you interested and entertained. The characters were thought out, not perfect, but I liked them. I wonder if Payn will have a story. Dont think I have seen one for him yet, but I will have to look again. There was one thing that was said that implied he may have his own story.  <br />So it was a good story, plenty to keep you occupied. The line for the hero is pretty close, so some are going to hate him and some love him. I loved him but hated some things he did. It will come down to personal tastes in this one. But I would recommend it.	2005-09-21

It is a very entertaining book, with plenty of opportunity to laugh. The mob, mysterous deaths, revenge, retaliation. The end was not as bad as you would think from the story as you read it. It had its own happy ending. I liked how Tea came out of her shell at the party. You could see Johnny's eyes pop out. Tea was a great character. I liked watching her come into her own. I also liked watching Johnny loose the battle with himself. In the end they both won. I liked the supporting characters, Cal and Rachele too. They had a nice side story. I liked Tea's sisters to, Eve and Joey. Wonder which will get their own story next?? So ya, good book. Recommend to all for a lazy day.	2005-09-16

The story flowed smoothly, I just cant think of anything really special that made this book stand out. I liked the book, but it just didnt hit the right notes for me. There is nothing that I can pick out and say that I didnt like. But I cant think of anything that I loved either.  <br />So, I do think it was a good book, I just dont think it was great. Good for a read, but I am not going to put it on my keeper shelf. It was good, but not spectacular.	2005-09-13

I like all of her books, some more than others. I have my own favorites that I love, which is most of them.  <br />This is the start of a new series, so no dark hunters or hunters of any kind. I thought that they were too short. The first story espically, I did not see the end comming at all, so when I turned the page it was like thats it? Where is the rest of the story. It was like runing into a brick wall. I thought all three stories were ok, I just know that each and every one of them could have been way better. There were not enough details, not enough development, not enough history. There was just alot that was missing. Im gonna take it like it is a fluke because they are short stories.  <br />I honestly thought that I would love everything she wrote, so I was disapointed to find that I didnt really care for the book once I was done reading it. I have never been disapointed by this author yet, so even the small disapointment is hard to take in.  <br />I am still a faithful reader and have all the confidence that the novels will be much better. If only for the fact they are longer and a lot more detailed.  <br />If you are planing to read the new series, I would get it and read it anyway, no matter the reviews. Like it or not, it is the start down a new road. You dont want to miss the first three stories lacking or not. And while they are lacking and could have been better, i still enjoyed reading the book, I thought it was still pretty good, just that it could have been much better.  <br />So, I would recommend this book to Sherrilyn Kenyon readers, the faithful ones. Dont know about anyone else.	2005-09-13

Its not the best book Ive read, but I can think of SO many others that were truly bad, horrible, make you cringe they are so bad. Im not sure what everyone was expecting, from the reviews you woulf think a documentary. The title is Under the Boardwalk, that is self explanitory for fun beach read, not serous make you think tank kind of book.  <br />Ok, Ari. She is a woman who thought she knew herself. She does not agree with her family of cons, thinks she is making the right choices by leaving and starting a new life. She is not over he insecurites, but thinks she is. When her sister turns up missing, she comes home to find out she is even more confused than when she left and now has to find herself. She was worried about her sister, but life still goes on, you know. It that twin bond thing. She knew that if something had happened to her sister, she would feel it. She felt for certain that she was alive, she felt it. So, there is that.  <br />Quinn was ok. Nothing really stands out about him. He an alpha male, pretty good guy for the most part.  <br />Honeslty, her family that no one likes is one of my favorite parts. They are funny and there are so many off the wall moments. They love their daughter, no matter that she does nto agree with how they live. No family is perfect and while they do scam, the border it on the line of legal. They love their daughter. So, I did not agree with her leaving and not talking ot them really for 5 years. Immature. But that is part of her growing.  <br />No this book is not as good as some of the others, it was still ok. It was light and fluffy, good for a relaxing read. It was plenty entertaining, a smooth flowing story that had humerous quarks all over. Slight mystery too.  <br />So, no it is not a searous book. It is a fun light read and I would still reccomend it reguardless of the other reviews. But then I dont usually care what other people think and I want my own opinion.  <br />This book does not stink, it wont win any awards, but it will keep you entertined.	2005-09-13

It is not like any of her other books. Altogether, it was an alright read. Strong main characters, prety good plot, good supporting characters, but when it comes to how and when they fall in love, that aspect is rather..flat. Their romance story came off as glossed over and almost as if it was not important. I liked both the characters. They were both endearing in their own ways. Maybe their was not enough insight to their thoughts, or intentions. But things were going one way and you are wonderig how they are going to overcome this hurdle, when suddenly the hurdle is gone and you have no idea where it went. It seems like we missed out on a very important part. How the characters get where they are going is most of a story.  <br />Not that it was a bad book. It was good. It just left me feeling that I missed something and therefore the book was not as fulfiling as it could have been. I would recommend this book for a read, but not for a keeper.	2005-09-02

Its a good book, if a little slower paced than some of the others. It is a more emotionally involved book. Not a whole lot of action. I had some issues with the heroine. Ian was a great character, wow, he was amazing. Considering what she knew, I could see wondering what he had to do with her brother going missing. Even after he came back. But I cannot agree with how she handled that at all. I dont want to say much, dont want to give it away. No, what she did was wrong but she did have to wait a while, which was better than no punishment to me. She was pretty wrong. Just the one action, but it was bad. Otherwise, she was pretty spunky and I did like her. This was a very amusing story too. The dialouge had a lot of light banter that had me laughing through the book. It was a good story and I liked it. I would recommend it.	2005-08-29
US	31888987	R1BH1AOEFRSKIK	0671742566	546443686	Tender Triumph (Sonnet Books)	Books	3	3	5	N	N	No way	Alright. This book, by Judith McNaught standards sucked, really really bad. As a normal book, it was ok. I am not going to go over the plot, I would just like to give my opinion on why I did not like it. First of all, I really disliked Katie. I am 23 years old myself and could not possibly understand how she could be so selfish. The way she thought and acted was enough to make me want to smack her. I mean, I understood about buying furnature for the house, feeling like you have to help, but she was ridiculous throught the whole book. I didnt even really like her in the end. My second problem with the story is how the whole thing played out. I think what makes it so bad is it could have been so much better, knowing what kind of stories Judith creates and there were so many parts that could have been so much better in the story. There were hundreds of things that could have been different, little things like what a reply was or a personal thought. How could she possibly put the Padre at fault for her actions and attitude tword him? She kept saying he had no right to ask her those questions or that it was none of his business, when that was his job. It was all his business. She was rude and spoiled. The end was one of the worst parts of the book. Everything was skipped over or made less important. There was no full love scene, after all that build up, there was no release. She never got around to finish telling him about David, the whole reason she could not say the words, I Love You.  <br />Even with the setting. It sounded so beautiful in the begining and could have been ecplored a little more.  <br />The secondary characters were pretty shallow. From what I knew of Gabriella, I liked her. She seemed sweet and fun. Her husband I didnt really care for, and there was not enough time at the end to fully change my opinion of him.  <br />Nothing in this story got the full of what it sould have. I am more disapointed because I KNOW this could have been so much better.  <br/>The thing is, is that it is interestig enough to hold your attention through most of the book. For the most part anyway, wanted to skip some parts, but not half hte book, so when you turn the last page, its like oh no way, this cant be it. Something has to make it better and what happened to the rest of the end?? And Ramon, I liked him. He said some things that made him seem old fashioned, I didnt think he was chauvanistic really. I fell in love with him early on in the story, even though he was almost unbelievable. He seemed too perfect there, so perfect that I forgot all about him misleading Kaite. I got swept away in the charm of him.  <br />But I would not recommend this to Judith McNaught fans, most will not like it. Not unless you have low expectations.	2005-08-23

We all have our own opinions I guess, me I LOVED it. It was shorter, but I did not feel it was missing anything. It was a very intense story that kept you on the edge wondering what was going to happen next. Kinda suspencefull, without the murder.  <br />Lauren, oh I loved Lauren. At first I thought she was a twit, until she about faced and gave Nick what he deserved. She managed to hold her own without being a b**ch. She was still very likable as she was telling Nick off. It was wonderful.  <br />Nick, oh Nick. Very sure of himself, has a well earned ego, without being too full of himself.  <br />The spying was a great plot line, that is what gives us our minor suspence. It was great. I agree 100% with one of the upper reviews, readers and dreamers or something. There were not alot of actual sex scenes, but the whole book is a primer. It didnt need alot of sex. With all the chemistry, wondering what is coming next and their battle of wills it is a never ending entertaining wonderful book. Not as long or filling as Paradise or Perfect, but still a great book just the same.	2005-08-22

This book was so good I cannot think of the right words to describe how good it is. This book was amazing. I have read Paradise and now Perfect too, while not a series, they do go together and I was glad that I had read Paradise before Perfect. Judith McNaught is a very potent writer. In my review for Paradise I made note of the emotional pull the book has on you. This one is no different. The book, the characters, their problems and worries become your own and so deeply that you are caught in the events as if you are living them. Not just there seeing it. The author puts you in the story by the deep emotional pull. She is truly an amazing writer. I am so glad that I have finally read one of her books.  <br />I loved Zach and Julie. I loved the story. I loved all the feeling, I loved that I hated things as much as I loved them and that made me love the whole all the more. Still with me?? You are not going to understand the profound effect these stories have on you unitl you read them. There are alot of really good reviews about the books, but even the best review cannot fully get across to you just how great the stories are. I would recommend this book to everyone. No matter what you read. This book, and Paradise, and Whitney have all carved out a place in my heart and my keeper shelf. Im sure other books of hers will as well, this is just what I have read. More on the way, reading one now. And i cant wait.	2005-08-08

Its full of danger, secrets, characters the have more then one face and the reader does not know who is working behind the lines, but you know it is someone close. You dont know what is around the next corner, and you never know what is going to happen next with James and Annie and while you know some of what is going through Jame's mind, Annie has no idea what he is thinking. She also has no idea what she has gotten herself into. The reader does not know much more, so you are along for the ride with Annie. This is really a great book, just so long as you dont mind the darkness of it. Those of you who like the edge it brings to the novel will love this book. It gives you goose bumps. I love the effect these books have on me. They are the best mix of suspence, romance, darkness and danger. Wonderful book. Highly reccomended.	2005-08-02

Too many times the story line sounds like an interesting story only to fall way off the radar. I read the book description and became really curious about the book, I really wanted to read it, so i figured why not. If it sucks that bad, Ill just put it down. So, I picked the book up, and didnt put it down until I was done. This is not the average contemporary romance by todays standards. No over used plot or already knowing what the end would be like by chapter 2.  <br />Carley will remind alot of people about themselves. She comes across as very real. She makes mistakes, but she is still a good person, she is a very capable woman who can take care of herself and do what needs to be done. She knows her own mind and is strong when the situation calls for it. She goes for what she wants, but admits defeat when feels the battle is lost.  <br />Evan, oh Evan. Yummy! He was one of the alpha males, but he was not a jerk at all. He took control, gave up control, got real stupid like they always do, then the light bulb turns on, but is it too late?  <br />The rest of the cast is just as entertaining. Dana reminds me of my own best friend. Carleys cat and Dex, and there is the whole story line of what happend to a Hollywood starlight that disapeared years ago, which was a great side story. This was a very full book. For the most part it was light hearted, funny and full of quirks. It had its own depth that comes from the reader identifing with the characters. You go on the same roller coaster that Carley does. The ups downs and in betweens. My heart got full and broke with hers.  <br />This really was a great story and I have a hard time beliving this was the authors come out book, it was really good. The best come out book I have EVER read. If the nest one is this good, Im gonna have to put her on the auto buy list. I loved this book, definite feel good book for a down day. I may even add it to my keeper shelf. I highly reccomend this book to everyone.	2005-08-02

I think her contemporary books are great. I think the same of her historicals.  <br />This is a good book. Dark and dangerous, once you start to read it you dont want to stop. For some reason, even though it is romance and a historical, it still falls into its own category. You wont find another author line Anne Stuart, not one that is even close. I wouldnt reccomend this to just anyone though, cant be squemish and think romance books are not ever dark. Those who enjoy those types of books as well are in for a rare treat.	2005-08-02

I would say that so far this is my least favorite of the books I have read. I am not saying it is not a good book, it is a really good book. Just compared to her other books, this one is lacking. OK, even though I figured out the \\"who done it\\" in the begining of the book, it still had  the suspense factor. I may have known who did it, but at times I still questioned it and did not know what he was going to do. That mixed with the sexual tension keeps your heart pounding through out the whole book. I though that John in this book was a little too um, distant. It seemed he felt nothing but lust. Most male characters usually make some mention of feeling something other then lust, even if they turn right around and tell themselves they are wrong, they at least mention it. I didnt like how up until the very last page, he didnt seem to have deeper feelings. He kept them just a little too hidden. He was an interesting character though. They all are in her books. There were things that were also left to the imagination I guess. Just little things that seemed to be signifigant were never mentioned after the first time. Like the knife. Did it ever have any impact on anything? Or even at the end when she wore the dress,it was so important to her when she was getting dressed, so while we are waiting for his reaction to it, it never happens. Just little stuff like that. I still thought it was a good book, but there were too many little things that were not matching up that took some of the enjoyment out of it for me. But dont knock it until you try it.	2005-07-15

One thing people need to know is you have to read the books in order. You cannot start in the middle of the middle of the series and expect to get the full effect of the book in the series.  <br />Now, for th book itself. It was a great book. It seemed like a new begining of sorts. It brings us to another branch of the dark hunters, and it is totally different then what we are used to. We are used to hot, steamy New Orleans and it's dark hunters who are all aquanted with Ash and have a complete oppoiste mind frame then this branch. Its cold here. Most of the hunters are not familiar to us very much. But, its a whole new leg for the series. Another branch that can go on and on. This whole series has endless possiblilties. That is one thing that the book points to. It is a little slower, that is what I will call it, but it has some much waited for answers to things we have been wondering sience reading Julian's story.  <br />The book was awesome, even if it was slower. This series needs this book for its content. The story of Alexion and Danger is very intense. From the start it seems to be doomed. There is no way to get around what is going to happen when Alexion has to leave. I thought I knew who he could have been, but I was not sur. His identy is not kept a secret exactly, but it is definelty not put out there for you and it is not an easy answer. Alexion, like all the dark hunters, has a deeply touching story. Jumps in and rips your heart out at how unfair it all is. The ending of this book was fantastic. It had me going. I could not see how things were to work out after the climax between teh good and bad. Felt like my heart was breaking. Out of all of the dark hunters, I saw how much Alexion needed someone. His character really reaches out to you. I thought Danger was, humm, well, a female dark hunter. She was very strong, took care of herself. She had a dose of attitude,did what had to be done and cared alot for those she was loyal to. I liked their story. I liked how they fell in love. I liked it all.  <br />I would not say my personal favorite for the series, its and awesome book. It fits right in the series and is an important link for the series. It has one of the best endings of the series though. I was stunned, completly. It made me cry, I will admit it. The book also has Sherrilyn's humor that has shown up in every book so far. But they all are serious in their own way. This book is going on the keeper shelf with the rest of the series, as I sit here and already eagerly wait for the next round, in whichever name is publishing next. This is a world like no other out there.	2005-07-11

Having never read this author, I was iffy. When a book has more then one element, it has to be done perfectly for the correct balance between the elements. Not alot of authors can do that to the readers satisfaction. This being a paranormal romance I thought was very good. The romance was great and the paranormal was not so off base that you had to talk yourself into believing it. It was a nice mix that did wonderful things for the book. This was a really good story. I would recommend it for a nice relaxing read to get lost in. Very enjoyable.	2005-06-28

He is very hard, almost cold. And he kept most everything in, even from the reader, so you dont see him falling in love. We know Chloe is in love. She has no qualms about letting the reader know what was on her mind.  <br />This was a very interesting story, some parts were hard to believe, but I chose to ignore that in favor or enjoying a darn fine good book. I can go with the flow, whatever makes a good story. This is a very heart pounding book, pretty bloody as a warning. And I wanted a little more of an ending for these two, but I closed the book with a smile on my face. Very good book. i recommend this highly.	2005-06-24

This is the first book that I have read by this author and in my opinion it is a very good book. While I would not consider that scene rape, it was rough is what I thought. I didnt see Clay as a villan, more that he loved Whitney to the point of it driving him crazy because of how she was acting. It is a very intracite plot and all the actions were reactions from one scene to the next. It was a very detailed plot with complex characters. I went through the whole range of emotions while I was reading this. It made me laugh, made me cry, I felt the happiness and the sadness. I felt like I was inside the book. At times I loved Whitney. Then others I hated whatever she was doing, same with Clay. At times I loved him, others I hated him. But in the end I loved both of them and their stories. I am also interested in the other two stories connected with them, espically Steven. This was an intense love story. And dont be discouraged by the number of pages in the book, I got past 500 before it felt like I had read more then a normal book and when I finished it, I wanted it to go on and on. I have never read a book like that. Usually when the book is that long, you could minus the whole middle and have a better story. Not so with this book. The whole story is amazing. I only came up with one thing I would have added to the book, more love scenes. There were a few and what was there was good, but it was such an emotional story, it almost needs the intmacy of the loves scenes. I really dont care what average opinion of this book is, I loved it. From now on I do believe that I will be reading much more of her. An author that takes you on an emotional roller coaster like this one, those are the ones who are around forever. I am now a huge fan of Mrs. McNaught from this one book. And I am rushing out to get more. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE!! Unless you dont like the rough part of the book, then dont touch it. This will only be amazing and one of the best books to more open minded readers. If you are not opend minded, maybe you should try to be. You are missing out on one of the best books of all time.	2005-06-22
US	31888987	R3TIRK8YAXZ0WK	0451408691	301911324	Shadow Lover	Books	5	40	41	N	N	Im captivated	Wow, Im not even sure how to start. I had one of her books recommended for me from Amazon, so I checked out the books under her name and saw a whole bunch of four and five star books, so I ordered this book as well as another by Anne Stuart and I figured I would read the older book first. I have never read her, so I was not sure what to expect. I knew it was romantic suspense, but Ive read books that are suppose to be romantic suspense but most end up being suspense books with a crappy romance story. Linda Howard is one of my favorite authors from that genere and Ive never found anyone who compares, until now. I dont know if this book is like the rest she has written and I dont care. I was not even really looking foreward to reading the book. Then I picked it up and started to read it. I finished it in one day. I was swept into the story right away and I couldnt stop. It kinda sucks you in, shakes things up, rattles them around, keeps you on the edge to the point where you are so sure you right about everything to then fall flat on your face. You get so into the story, you cant figure out who is wrong, him? her? or you? Quite a whirl wind effect. It was hard to figure out what was happening or why unless she decided to tell you. This is a masterfully weaved mystery. I cant believe all these years and I never knew what I have been missing. I dont want to go into the plot cause everyone else already did, but it was a good one. I was really surprised. Now, I am going to begetting every book that I can find. I highly recommend this book. Make sure you have plenty of time because nothing is going to be able to tear you away and hold your attention until you finish that book.	2005-06-22

Each book after has been a little better, then a little more. The patern continues in Project Eve. The plot seems cooky at first, brainwashing, but the way its brought into the story, well, it has the right spin and falls into the believable catagory. The way it is put out there to the reader is something that could happen today. So, there the girls being brain washed (for things I am not going to tell you), who are in turn used for sadistic purposes and some of the profits are supporting terrorists, all possibly based out of a church.  <br />The father of one of the students at the churches college hires a private investigator, Rachel, to discover what happened to his daughter who dies in a suspicious accident. The ball starts to roll. The CIA get involved and everybody wants something for nothing. Old flame, CIA agent Elijah enters the pic and from then on its explosive. Rachel and Elijah have a past that does not leave happy memories. The tension between these two comes off the page. Many other factors are thrown in like Rachels brother and the game that Rachel has to play with Dwight. And who is Dwight, good or bad? The church, banks, overseas missions, the Pastor. Who did what? Who knows about what and how much of it is really connected.  <br />I have to say that it is better then I thought it would be. I knew it would be ok, but I was entertained cover to cover. I do recomend this book. It had a little of everything in it, so lots fo people can enjoy it. I liked it and will keep my eye out for the next new release.	2005-06-15

I have been waiting not so patiently for Jamie to come out and I got it as soon as it did. I have read almost all of Lori's books and I love all of them. I have been waiting for Jamie's story ever sience I finished Just A Hint-Clint and it was worth it. I picked the book up and it was over, I could not put it down. I do not want to go over the plot so much as lots of people already tell you what the book is based on, I want to tell people how it made me feel. I picked it up and did not put it down. I read and re-read most of the book because I would read this one part and be blown away, so I had to go back and read it again. This is a magical story. Jamie is everything I thought he would be. I absolutley melted. I loved that throught all the books Jamie sees and helps all his friends. He does all he can to make things right in his friends lives, thinking that he would be alone all his life. But oh no, Jamie is too special to be alone. As he felt others pain and problems, there is someone out there who feels Jamies pain and knows what he needs to be whole.  <br />We also get to see most of the cast from the previous books. When everyone comes together to halp Jamie, sho thinks he does not need it. Oh, this was a wonderful book and I loved every minute I spent reading it. I have only one complaint, that the series is now over.=(. All the loose ends were wrapped up, and everything is taken care of. We get the scoop on Alyx and Scott who have been butting heads ever sience Say No to Joe?  <br />This is definetly a feel good book that puts you on cloud nine. Its one of the best in the series. It left me with a dreamy look on my face and feeling good inside. Jamie is just wow, he has his imperfections, which makes him perfect. Our author knows there is no perfect guy, so she creates the best combination of real man, with fantasy. The book has a lot of elements working for it as well. It is funny, touching and has a little mystery hiding in the shadows.Not too much of anything to make for a great story. I never once got bored or wished for anything other then what I was reading, not one thing could be changed to make it any better in my opinion. This whole series is going on my keeper shelf, its one of the best out there. The series is in my top three and the book is in the top five for me. In a line of hundreds of books, that is good placement. I am sad that it is over, but now I am excited wondering what is going to be next. I highly recommend this book, go out and buy it. But make sure you have plenty of quiet time, you wont move very much while lost in wonderland. I give this book 5+ stars and recommend it to everyone under the sun. You wont regret it, well maybe when you have finished you'll regret being done, but thats about it. This books fits every romance readers ideal book in my opinion.	2005-06-13

The suspense is thrilling, the comedy had me laughing out loud and I wanted to know who did it. Trying to figure out who the bad guy was was like chasing a tail, I never got anywhere no matter how much I thought I did. It was a good run around. I loved the characters, even the dog, she was cute. Only one thing was a little different from her other romantic suspense novels, the romance in this book was not all that much. It was like being on a roller coaster, it was the longest up hill ride with the fastest 30 second ride of my life. Almost like she is switching from romantic suspense to suspense, which is cool for her but not for me. The romance was more of an emotional romance until the last 100 pages or so. This is not normal for Robards, I hope she stays with the romance in her books, reguardless of what other elements are in the plot. She writes GREAT romantic suspence novels. I read mysterys for years and years. So, I like my romance now. I dont want to loose one of my favorite authors. This was an awesome book, gripping and engrosing. It was not what I thought it would be so I was just a disapointed after I got done. This is in no way a bad book at all, this book is amazing, just lacking with the romance, which is one of my favotite elements in her suspence books. This book will satisfy a bigger class of readers though. Not many people willnot enjoy it, even not being what I expected, I loved it. I just hope the next one out has more romance.	2005-06-10

I read Master of the Night and then this one too, I missed the book in the anthology, but I do not feel as if I am missing anything. I know it would be better if I read that one too, and I will, only point of fact the books can stand alone. Anyway, this was a really good book. I liked that Diane had her own power. I am all for woman power any day, but still Llyr was all man. One searously alpha male hot, sexy man. The plot was great and grows off of MOTN, and will grow into more stories it seems. I like the world that Angela Knight creates and the trips her stories take you on. Its a journey. Highly recommended and waiting for the next book with Angels Knight's name on it.	2005-06-06

Overall, its an enjoyable story. I liked the characters. Cassie and Harrison are totally opposite and think the other is the stero type of each others image. Naturally the shallow pool has hidden depths, which is discovered when Cassie and Harrison are forced to spend time together after the amulet is stolen and Adam turns up missing. Each is trying to solve the mystery for each owns reasons and they are the only two who have some kind of idea. The mystery was not so hard to figure out. I had an inkling after one of the conversations, then things kept falling into place. I still didnt know what happened to Adam or why the amulet was wanted so badly, so I still enjoyed the story until the end. The romance was pretty good too. That had good and bad points. When our two main characters get together in the begining, they do not like eachother, so when one or the other is doing things because they care, they could not figure out their reactions. Thinking they did not like the other, it made no scence to them that they would are about this or that. So we get to see the romance build. The final and only full love scene was a let down. The build up was great, but then when we get to it, it was blah. I thought there could have been more romance, the adventure was about equal to if not more then the romance. But it was a fun adventure none the less. I would still recommend this book for a light fun read. Some parts are silly and some of it seems forced. Some scenes seemed to be placed there just for what would happen afterword. Just didnt seem to fit. For example, the couch scene. Dont get me wrong, that was one of the funniest parts fo the book, but it didnt really fit all the way. I liked the style of the first two books better, but I enjoyed this one almost as much.	2005-06-06

I thought it was a good intorduction to the series as well. It gives some outline to every point with just enough, but not too much information to make you look foreward to the next books to come. In comparison to other books, I dont think it is up there with the best, but it is good. It is an entertaining read. Its funny with a good plot and the characters are gems in themselves. I hope we get to see some of them in the books to come. I recommend this book to everyone.	2005-06-01

So far, the second full novel in the series and it is not to be missed. This book goes in and touches you deeply with the Brotherhood of the Sword and their stories. Christian caught my curiosity in the first book, ROTW which was also great. I liked Adara, she was very strong and stood up for herself. She was smart and a good Queen to her people. This book was worth the wait and I am already waiting for more books. Most of Kinleys books are connected with one part of the story line or another. Just not the pirate books. So, you see characters from all kinds of books popping out all over the place and it makes the scope of the story huge. Many books can take off from this and there is no way to guess which will come first. The range opens up untold opportunities. Reading these books is like going to another world. Kinley has been on my auto buy sience I started to read her years ago. She creates another world with adventure and magic. I love to read her books and be taken away. I would do nothing other then highlu resommend this book.	2005-06-01

Each succesive book is better then the last one and they are all good. In this book, we get a look back at Mr. Complete where this book is off of. One of my favorite characters is the secretary. Love her. I liked this story. It was fun. There were lots of laugh out loud scenes. there were touching scenes. The whole book just flowed together into a great book.

It was different and if it is like Star Track, more power to the author because I never cared for those movies. It is an interesting adventure that's for sure. The different worlds the author creates and the alien life forms. I liked the journey that we were brought on. Ya, Deana was a dunce at times, but I thought overall she made a good character. Lorgin too. The book is about his magical journey. The whole book is the magical quest, an FYI to those who missed that. It is him in the tunnel, when he came out and why. The stone and everything after that. Those who read the book will know what I mean. Because what would have happened if the stone was in the wrong hands? The sex scenes sizzle. I would reccomend this book. It is a fun adventure to new places and all kinds of \\"people\\"	2005-05-18

I liked the gypsy theme and background info was cool. The characters were very colorful and I really liked the grandparents. Some of the conversations were kinda corney and I thought the hero was a man, but could have been more manly. Yes, he can fight, but heros are suppose to be able to fight, shoot and fence. He was an awesome hero, no doubt about it though. I liked it.	2005-05-17

I have read almost all her books and just buy them off the shelf as they come out. I know that this is the first full novel in the series and the first story was in an anthology. I have not read the anthology, but that is ok. This book lays the ground work for the series. It intorduces alot of characters that you know are going to be important in comming books. You also get a big chunk of background for most of the characters.  <br />Yes, some characters from other books are mentioned but they really do not have too much to do with this story. They are characters that are from the same time period, and maybe they will play a part in these books, but they are still seperate books. I happen to like that they are connected and see familar characters sometimes.  <br />There were some disturbing parts of the story, but that seems to be the norm for Kinley storys. A range of emotions, so in my opinion, it added to the overall effect the story had on you.  <br />The \\"who dun it\\" was kinda obious, I was not sure at times, but turns out I was not wrong. By that time in the book, you already know what they all lived through and my heart went out to them, all of them. It just makes it easier to understand the choices and lives the men lead. It was not a perfect book, but it was a damn fine book. I recommend this and will be moving on to the next book, then the next.......	2005-05-11

It was a battle not to put the book down and go bake whatever they were talking about next. The dialouge (and recipe directions) speak to mothers and women everywhere. Michael was almost too good to be true. Ya, he is a dream. Candace is a lil hardheaded for most of the book, but thankfully she snaps out of it. Her grandmother is a gem. I think she just became my role model.  <br />This really is a funny sweet story. Candace and Michael have a great connection. There is not alot of sex, but there is tension and there are sparks. This book is a page turner. I loved it. I am going to be getting the next book in the series and recomend it to whoever needs a chocolate fix and a laugh. But this copy is mine.

Even though it changed her on the outside, she was still a sweetheart. She was strong, very courageous, down to earth but stands up for herself. She is confused about her worth at first, but works through it all.  <br />Theo, of Theo. Can I have one of you too? I dont even know where to start on Theo here, but he is one of the good guys for sure.  <br />My only problem with the book is the sex scenes or lack of. There is sexual tension, but then when its getting to the good stuff, the scene changes. Every single scene. What in the world is up with that? It bothered me, but not that much. I was able to get over it. Knowing that, I still could not put the book down. Most people who read it will be able to connect with it in one way or another. This book is real life. I just finished it not even an hour ago, and someone has already borrowed it. I highly recommend this book!! <br />	2005-04-07

Almost no complaints about that. The problem with all the sex is the lack of a solid story in between. With the lame story line and lots of kinky sex, you have a bad porn. There were so many points that the story could have taken off at, but it didn't. There was alot of repeat dialouge. At first I thought I would scream with all the sweethearts, then it was the constant use of \\"filly\\" and all the references to animals. The same descriptive terms were used in similar situations. Mostly the sex scenes, pay attention. \\"Pearl in the hood\\" and the constant use of the word dew. What was up with that? It was almost gross after the hundredth use. I have read plenty of romance novels and a fair share of erotic romances, and I know they are better then this.  <br />The characters have no depth. None of them. Not the main characters or the supporting characters. When a new person is introduced into the story you get no history of the person, so you kind of learn as you go, which would be ok, but there is not much to learn of anyone. Most all the characters had no depth. The plot was shallow.  <br />The best part of this novel other then the sex, is the end. In the last 30 pages or slow, you get a real story. Things open up, action starts happening and it is entertaining enough that it holds your attention, which was a big problem for me in this book. I was skipping alot.  <br />Then there is the obsession that that guy Lennox has with Viola. What is up with that? I know that scenero could have been played out way different and way better then how it was done. Hello!! <br />And who in their right mind is going to smile and say \\"hello\\" to the brother they have not seen in years to be held like a baby? Ya, did not like her very much after that.  <br />Also, the bad guys are suppose to get it in the end, right? So, why did her friend get what she got? The rest of the bad guys never got what was coming to them. This story bombed. I did give it three stars because of the sex scenes. Even though they need work, they were pretty good.	2005-04-06

So, I checked out the reviews and thought I was missing out on something. So, I got the book, read it and now I wonder if I am still missing something. Im not complaining about this book at all. I thought it was funny and well paced. It had good characters and dialouge (for the most part) It's just at times the story was almost silly. Not funny silly, like made-for-kids-silly.  <br />I know I am the minority here, but I dont think that this is the best book I have ever read, even out of one year. Even if I do read hundreds, this one goes into the good category, but not my keepers. Its not even very memorable for me, I read it over the weekend and forgot most of the story already. So, while I may sound like I am bashing (I am really not)Maybe the reviews built up my expectations to think that I was going to read an amazing mind blowing book. While this book is good and funny and entertaining, its not the best I have read. I just want to let people know that it is a really good book, but in my opinion, not the best. I do recomend it and you will enjoy it, it justmight not be a keeper for you, like it is not for me.	2005-04-05

I have read all the Carley Phillips that have come out to date, including this one and I dont think this book is up to the standards of her other books. It did not flow smoothly, it was bumpy. And there was not enough emotional connection in hte book. There is plenty of sex and its all good, but in between there is not much in the way of connecting and growing together. Its an ok story, but I know what she is capable of and this is not even close. Ok, but not a winner.	2005-04-04

It had an ok plot, good dialouge and a prety good cast of characters. All except Decland. Now, he was an ok guy sometimes. For the rest of the book he is so self centered and his ego is so big that he cannot see past it to the fact that life in general does not revolve around him. That he is not God and that all things do not happen because he is alive. Throught the book it did not get better like it is suppose to, but worse. He would drone on and on to the point where you want to smack him and are yelling at your book. Its unbelievable. Rose is a sweetheart. She is sunny and warm and funny. Paired with an ego. Now, Decland does get a reality check and you see his light bulb turn on when he realises that he is not the world, but he does not redeam himself enough at all. Not even close. Being the *ss he was, another half of a book could have been written and he still would nto be redeamed enough. And I hear that her second book is worse the this one. Not good. I thought this was an ok book, but I would not recommend you buy it, library it.	2005-04-01

The first book in this series was my first book by Dodd but not the last. I now have a collection, which this book will be added to.  <br />I loved this book. It had the right amount of everything. Tension, suspense, love and laughter. Although the author gives away more to the readers and the readers figure out what is going on way before the characters. Thats the good tension.  <br />This was a wonderful third story and I only have one complaint. This story seems to be the end of the series. But I am hoping it is not as we still have the foster brother Gabriel, who really needs his own story. So, this just cant be the last, but the tone says it is. It wraps up most issues in the story, but I am keeping my fingers crossed.  <br />I likes most everything else and cant think of anything else to complain about. Wonderful story. 5 stars and highly recommended!! Enjoy	2005-03-30

I liked the setting, I like the characters and the secondary characters. I thought the sex scenes were plenty hot, but there could have been more. I thought Simon came off as very conflicting. You could tell how sonfused his feelings were because of his conflicting actions. He would pull El closer until she came close, then push her back. He does touch on the dominating in the love scenes, but its hot. I dont think he worked hard enough to get Ellen back at the end though, I think he could have worked for it a little more. Seems he got off too easy for making Ellen feel the way she did at times. She was a little of a push over at times, but she took care of herself for the most part.  <br />While my favorite by this author is stil her first book, Behind Closed Doors, Return to Me was pretty good. Just dont expect the intensity of BCD, this in comparison has almost a relaxed tone. I do recommend it.	2005-03-29

I loved it from beginning to end and could not put it down.  <br />This is Gemma's story that we have met in previous books. Gemma is the odd ball because she is a witch and that is not accepted by all her family. Gemma was a sweetheart with a huge heart. Sometimes a little too big. There were times when she let people walk all over her a little too much. But twords the end, she has more spine. Good for you Gemma. Dont take all that crap. So, it leads to Gemma rediscovering herself and becoming the woman she wants to be.  <br />Sean was a great hero. In the beginning he is pretty shallow, but that is where his growth in the novel comes in. His story is also about being a fireman and the toll it really takes on their lives. I thought it was interesting that Sean was a fireman in NY and that 9-11 was included in the story. Most people already have a healthy dose of respect for fireman for what they do, espically after 9-11, and this story gives you a little taste of how one day really did change everyones lives. It shows how the fireman really are hero's, what they go through and how hard it can be. Its a nice dose of non fiction in a fiction story. For all his faults and issues, Sean is a top notch hero. He makes his mistakes and learns from them, then changes his life because of what he has learned.  <br />I thought the issue of Gemma being a witch could have been explored more, considering that is the main problem Gemma has with her family. And also, this stroy seems to span across a few months, but you never really know how much time has passed or what month you are in. Any holiday's that would have happend were not mentioned. From what I can figure, the time frame is over a period of at least six months.  <br />This book is another winner by this author and you should run out to grab it. It's a great book.	2005-03-10

It had entertaining characters and an interesting plot. It left you guessing as to who the bad guy was, I was completly surprised.  <br />Cassie is a strong independent woman who know herself. Alex is a strong man who know what he wants and is not overbearing.  <br />My favorite book by Michele is Getting Her Man and I still think it is the best. This was really good.

I figured that this book would be pretty good, if nothing else I know that she writes one hot sex scene and I knew this book was short enough I could get through it fast if it bored me. So, I was pleasently surprised when I found a really good plot in between the hot sex. I also found that I loved the characters. Even though the book is shorter then most novels, and you usually dont get to get inside the characters mind because there just arent enough pages in the book. Not so with this story. This story mainly takes place over three days, it is constant contact with the main characters for those three days. So, it almost makes it seem longer then that. A very action packed three days as well. No, it was not as involved as a full length novel, but it sure fits the bill.  <br />This was a wonderfully sensual novel. Maybe because the story is over a three day period it is full of all kinds of action. Something is always going on and happening. Enjoy!!	2005-03-04

It was a catching story and it was a page turner. The kind you cant put down. The first person point of view is a little disorienting, but I just acted like she was talking to me. Made it a little easier. I really didnt care for that, but I got over it. The story was good enough for it to not matter too much. Actually, the story was great. It was lighter then I expected. I thought it would have been darker considering the story line. Not disapointed with that though. I did have one disapointment. Just one, but it is major. In most Linda Howard books there is, not sex, but the spark. The sizzle. You feel the connection and when there is sex, it is explosive. This novel did not follow suit. There was some sizzle, but not alot. There were no sparks and nothing close to an explosion. To me, that is a BIG missing element as well as an important one. Everything else was good Ol Linda writing, except the skimping of attraction. Where did it go and who stole it? It was somewhat there, but then always fizzled out. I wish I knew why. I hope the next book has the sizzle with no fizzle. Forever faithful to Linda.	2005-03-04
US	31888987	R1FU777QJXD6WQ	0060083298	429568377	Dominant Blonde, The	Books	4	2	2	N	N	OK read	I found this book at a discount book store and grabbed it. It sounded interesting. I checked it out on Amazon to see what the general opinion was and here I am. In my opinion I dont think it is full fledge chick-lit. I am not a strictly chick-lit reader, I like all romance. This book was more of a combo. I liked the setting alot and the plot was good. The plot kept unfolding a little more and the way the author wrote this story, you get peaks at what is coming next. Only you dont know if it will play out how you think. We get to see this story from all the characters perspectives, so you know what is going on on all sides, but the characters dont. It really helps with the suspense element, which helps the story out a lot because the suspense is not a main part of the plot. This is a lighter read that has more laughs then suspense.  <br />Along with a great plot and story, the characters were great too. Liam was to die for. He was real and man, the author did a good job of making you really want a piece of him. Lydia was alright too. She was all woman, that is for sure. I did have a small problem with Mrs Lydia. She cries through the whole book! Sometimes it fits the scenes. Her boyfriend did drown, right, but she blubbers through the whole book. I did not see the point in that. It almost made her the seakest heroine that I have ever read and I did not care for that.  <br />Overall it was a good read. Highly entertaining, catchy, fun and absorbing. Liam is a great hero and wonderful lover in this book. I think the author did a great job trying to picture every womans fantasy and make him sound real.	2005-03-02

Every element, every feeling that could possibly end upp in a story is here. This book will make you laugh cry and everythign in between. This is what romance is all about. This is why we pick up books to get lost in. Nobody's Baby but Mine is one of the best books that I have read in my life. SEP is now on my auto buy list as I have not been disapointed in any of her storys. I just end up loving her books more and more. Someone told me that Nobody's Baby is one of the best books SEP has come out with. I would have to agree and take it a few steps farther. Its one of the all time best romances out there and I cant say enough about it. I give this book the highest recommendation. GO BUY THIS BOOK. You'll want your own to put on the keeper shelf.

This was a fun story that was highly entertaining. The romance was sweet and the characters loveable.  <br />The supporting characters were wonderful and I liked the small town that was going on.  <br />I thought the suspense could have been worked a little more. It was not that hard to figure out who did what. But there is the element of suspense that adds a little extra spice to the story line.  <br />I do recommend this story for a light fun read.	2005-02-28

I read the first book in the trilogy and loved it so I went to get this one right away. i knew I would like it, but I ended up loving it.  <br />This book is about Ellie and Mason's story. We meet both characters in the first book and now it is their turn. I really really liked Ellie. She was cute. Mason was real. I liked how we really got into their heads. I liked how the author made the characters get into their own heads. It is so much more real and makes it easier to go with the story and feel like you are right there.  <br />This story has two \\"real\\" people with real problems that we can all identify with. It is also about choices and the paths in life and what can happen when the right choices are not made. It covers the highs and lows of life. It also shows us Abby and Chase again, whom I love and we get to see a little more of Marty, the third sister and third story. This story also showns us more of the town and of small town life.  <br />The romance is top notch and very sweet. The plot is good and the story is just bottom line the bomb. Needless to say, I HIGHLY recommend this book.	2005-02-25
US	31888987	RDTYV700BC116	0758205961	373656344	Smart Mouth	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Pretty good book but....	I would have to say it needed more work. I did enjoy this book. It was funny and the plot was OK, the sex was hot and plentiful, I really did not like our heronie Reese. She was not stupid, but most of the time, she came off as not too smart. Why she kept on asking Derek questions that he could not answer is beyond me. It got really annoying that Reese is so smart, but yet cant figure out why Derek wont tell her confidental information from the FBI. I have no problem with a heroine that has an attitude. Most of the time, a spunky heroine who does not take crap from anyone is a great element of a book. Unfortuneatly Reese just comes across as a bitch. Sorry to say. Its alot of \\"Me this and me that.\\" Or it goes this way or no way. I mean come on, if someone pick up FBI evidence, who in their right mind is going to keep it for a story when you could go to jail? Then there is Derek who as a man and hero is a good one but for and FBI agent is a wash out. Kind of kills some of the story that our big bad FBI agent kinda really sucks.  <br />The plot was interesting. I thought it could have been worked with more and gotten more out of it. The most suspenceful thing was weather or not Markson was going to go through with what he was suppose to do.  <br />So, this is a pretty good book. If it had more work and more likeable characters, it would be even better. I think that Erin McCarthy is a name to keep your eye open for. While this book is not the best, it is really entertaining. I did not want to put it down. Just because I do not like some of the elements does not make it a bad book. But beware, this book has A LOT of sex. So if you dont like that in a book, this is not for you. Its really hot sex though.  <br />I am going to look for other books by the author, Im sure the stories will get better over time, but dont let that discourage you from trying this book too.  <br />	2005-02-24

Books	5	2	4	N	N	Total 180	This is only the second book that I have read by SEP and I liked the first book well enough to look at others. I had just picked this book up on a whim at the book store when I saw it there. I figured it would at least be ok. It started out intreguing. Why did Sugar Beth do this or that? Why does she have to stay? Then you start to meet all the others. The Seawillows, Colin, Ryan and the others. About 1/3 of the way in the book I was mad. Sience when is it ok for people to act like that? Who do they think they are. It was a dicusting display of retubitition. I could not believe what I was reading. And why oh why was Sugar Beth Staying there? Why was she taking what they were dishing? Oh, dont get me wrong, Sugar Beth was a great heroine, and she did not take it without giving some back. She did not exactly take it, but she didnt really dish it how she could have. You will see what I mean. Hard to discribe. Quiet dignity Maybe? <br />From everyones memories of Sugar Beth you learn that she was not so sweet growing up. But when you compair that Sugar Beth to the one we meet in the book, you see a vast difference in the two. She grown up to be a different person. She is really strong. She is one of the greatest heroines that I have read. Disregard stupid name. She really is not like you would think. <br />The story progresses to Sugar Beth looking for her painting and life as she is learning to live it at the opposit end from where she started in the town. Everyones roles are reversed. Sugar Beth is now the better poor person, while everyone else turned into the rich-better-then-everyone-that no one can stand. Quite the turn around. Reversed Cinderella story I believe it said in the novel and it was.  <br />I did not like Colin in the begining and almost hated the man after what he did to Sugar Beth at the dinner. Yet the dinner seems to be the start of the turning point of the novel. I almost put the book down after the whole dinner scene. It ws like watching the badpart of the movie peaking through your fingers, you dont want to watch, but you cant help it. You have to know.  <br />Anyway, things really pick up steam and fly after that. Everything starts to turn around, you get to see into the characters more and really understand why you love to hate these people and what makes them loveable at all.  <br />This actually was on the lighter side for the plot, its the emotional value of this book that sets it so far apart. There are no deep issues, no murder. Its the emotion. This story really gets into you and makes you feel. No matter how much I disliked a character or how distasteful a particular scene was I could not put this book down.  <br />From the middle to the end, my whole preception of the book had changed. Once you get to delve into every characters memories, thoughts and feelings it makes everything so much clearer. I felt like I was Sugar Beth going through all that and feeling the way she did. This is definetly an emotional roller coaster and it takes you all over the place.  <br />Once I got to the end I loved everyone. Even Winnie and Colin, the two most hated in the begining. I loved everything about this book. I loved even hating it in the begining. Kudos to SEP for writing such a stunning novel that can pull youin such opposite directions and have you love it the whole time. To come out on the opposite end from where you started.  <br />I read once that you remember things more clearly then others because of the emotion involved. More emotion, the more it sticks out in your memories. I get the feeling I will remember this book for a long time. It is going on my keeper shelf. <br />I was so worried, I thought I would hate this book from the reviews and once I started to read it I thought I was right. I have never been so glad I was way wrong. Highest recommendations.	2005-02-18

This is my first book by this author and I did like it and was not disapointed by it. I just did not see it as much of a romance. There was sexual tension throught the whole book. There were also lots of laugh out loud moments, it was pretty funny. Collin was one of my favorite characters from the book.  <br />I just did not feel a strong connection from the main characters. You could tell they were in lust but when did we get to see their feeling for eachother grow and them come together and all that? They were almost too busy making eachother jealous to get together. Until Annie walks in on Matt at his house and things take off from there. Only it did not get all that romantic, it was sexy yes, but not really romantic. <br />I felt more romance from Rico and Helena in the end. Although Helena was a little over the top.  <br />So, while it was an entertaining story and ws laugh out loud funny, I thought it needed alot more romance. It was a great book, but I thought it fell in more with light romantic comedy. So that is why I gave it 3 and a half. Its a good book, but not the ammount of romance I had expected. Mrs. Halliday is a good author and I will get her books again, I just know what to expect now.	2005-02-16
US	31888987	RAH6XQJ4FDXF2	0446611158	750342547	Slow Hands	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Better and better	So far I have read all of Laurne Bach's books. They progress as she wrote more. So far this is the best book she wrote and I liked it. There are some minor details that need work, but overall this is a great romantic suspence.  <br />It all starts as Alec comes back into town to protect Keira, whom he left without a word to 10 years ago. The story takes off from there. They have an explosive romance with lots of sparks. Their love scenes get your blood pumping and their fights light up the pages. The suspence keeps you wondering and on the edge without being too dark.  <br />Willie is a hoot and Franny was one of my favorite characters aside from the main ones. Scarlet was almost a waste of a character. She is one of the details that need work. As well as some plot work. There were just not enough details in some of the more important scenes. Like with Alec leaving. That is a big issue and a big part of the story line, yet it does not get much focus.  <br />This is a story with great characters, a good plot and good story line. The romance does not take a backseat to the suspence and both elements keep you on edge. I do recommend this book and hope you enjoy it.	2005-02-16

No, it is not like other books she wrote. I have read all her books. Why people want all books to be just like the last one they read escapes me. Plots and storylines are suppose to change, otherwise whats the point? <br />The Trouble with Valenties day starts off a lil slow. We meet Kate and Rob in the bar where Kate tried to pick Rob up, but he turns her down. Now, we have the domino effect of that meeting when Rob comes back into town and him and Kate meet again and he starts to realize that Kate is not what he thought. On with the show to see these two come together whlie batteling all the way. Lots of chemistry and fireworks. They have a good romance and so is the secondary romance of Grace and Kates grandfather.  <br />I dont think Rachel painted the town in a cookey light. It came across as a small town where everyone knows everyone else's business and loved to gossip. <br />There was a few things that I did not agree with, such as Rob cheating on his wife and some of the things he did to Kate. But I think it falls into more of how people can change.  <br />I dont have to agree with every element of a book to think it is great. Rob does not live the entire book in his Hummer, he just has one and ya, even drives it. But he is out of it plenty.  <br />This is a very entertaining book. It is funny and has a good story line. I read it in one day, then went back and read it again. Highly recommended, enjoy!!	2005-02-15

This book had steamy love scenes. Sidonie and Aleric have a very passionate and deep connection. The plot was good but could have been better. The plot in the story has the power to make this book a powerful page turner if it had more suspence or on the edge of your seat something, but the author chose to leave it on the lighter side, Im guessing. The Devil to Pay is a good read. Its an entertaining romp and I do recommend it.	2005-02-10

I liked the battles that Christopher and Honoria had. They had a spark that lit and blew up with everything they did. From the deck to the bed, they ingnited. I almost lost hope after reading the first two books this author wrote, they fell flat in my opinion. No bad books, but nothing to get excited over. Not this book though.   I liked all the characters. I thought it was funny to watch Chris get high and mighty to be brought down by his lil 'o wife. Honora was a remarkable character. I liked Manda. She was a riot. I thought she had a very interesting intorduction into the story. All in all, I was pleasntly surprised with this book. I was not expecting it to be as good as it was. Not to mention its a pirate book. I have a sinful love for pirate books. This will go on my keeper shelf and I highly recommend it.	2005-02-08

Maybe that is why I liked it so much. The movie must be good, because this book was great. I really dont care that it is a copy cat story. It is one of the best in the series. Celest was a very smart woman. She was pretty and very independent. We first meet her while she is a young woman living with the Thockmortons. Then she goes to Pairs, comes back polished and takes everyone by storm. She thinks she loves Ellery and plans to snare him. Enter Garrick. Hard man, head of the family with a stone face. When we mix these two, its like mixing night and day. What an effect they have on eachother. Celest and Garrick have their own awakening. You can almost see when Garrick's light bulb turns on.

I never guessed the secret Hannah held onto all those years.  <br />From the very beginning, this book takes off. Battles of wits and wills. Passions flaring and the characters constantly bumping heads. Both strong people who want to live their life their own way.  <br />At times, when Dougland was going on and on about his revenge and all that, he was rather cruel, but that attests to how much her leaving bothered him before, so much he did not evn realise it, but you do. He was not all that bad, except for when he was trying to get her to leave. Made me want to smack him.  <br />There was the mystery of who is doing away with all the earls and why. Then Miss Spring and her followers. They were endearing and the story would not have been the same without them. There was one thing that I was unclear on, and that is what exactly did Dougland's butler do all those years ago. We know he helped, but how?  <br />Why would a man wait years to find the wife who left him and do what he did, if he did not care? I know that does not excuse some of his behavior, but it more or less explains why he went up high on the mean scale. Its a good book, so far the best in the series. Get and make your own opinion. Its not that bad at all, it really is that good.	2005-02-02

I have not had a disapointment yet.  This book is right up there with the rest of them. I basically fell in love with Bobby after he had his flash back involving his mother. I have to say that it broke my heart and I balled like a baby for Bobby. Very touching. Although, I did not like how mean he was at times. I though it went just a little too far. Not enough to kill the story or my liking of Bobby though. I finished this book in one day and went over it again. It was good.    I liked Lacey's daughter, Robin and even her romance ws not so bad. It was a little wierd at first being that she is young. But it was a young romance and in the end just as touching.   So, why if I loved this book so much did I only give it 4 stars? Here is why. The whole thing about Lacey being an unwed mother and being shunned by people and towns was over done. Being that I am a single unwed mother myself, I know what kind of grief people give. And yes, some are more opinionated then others and some openly show disproval, it is not as bad as the book made it out to be. It almost sounded like it was from the 50's when being an unwed mother was forbidden. Also, at times Lacey was just unbelievably overprotective. It was silly the way she handled some of the situations with her daughter. Everyone makes mistakes and most people take the blame themselves, liek they should. I did not agree with Lacey punishing Robin for the mistakes she made almost 20 years ago. It was in NO way believable at all. And lastly, I did not like Bobby's name. Its silly I know, but I did not like the whole \\"Bobby Mac\\" It just reminded me of Micky D's Big Mac everytime I read it.   But those are all such little things, so thye do not make a difference in the overall story, except lacey with Robin, that kind of put a damper on things.   Overall, one of the best books and highly recommended. Enjoy!!	2005-02-02

Although I read the series out of order, (second book first, third book second and first book last)it did not make the books any better or worse. They are all still awesome books. Being that this is the first book in the trilogy, it gives a good opening to the rest of the series. It intorduces many characters, but not too many that everything clashes. It shows the workings of Bow Street as they started to expand and get more power, as well as more scorn. It shows what these men went through everyday just to do as they felt right and all the stuff they had to take from everyone. Its a good view of the fight police went through to establish themselves. <br />Grant is a great hero. Even though he does not like Vivian he takes her home to get her well, and also to exact some revenge on her. Only when she wakes up, she is not the Vivian that everyone knows she is. Lisa takes you on a good ride while youtry to figure out what is going on in the book. Who is this? Why is that? She does a good job of spinning the who done is and why.  <br />Its a good tale that keeps you guessing and turning the pages. Highly recommended. Enjoy!	2005-01-28

Maybe I expected too much out of this book, but its no more then I expect out of the other Dodd books I have read. While this story was not terrible, it was not even close to what she usually writes. Maybe I had too high expectations, but I felt this story fell short. It did not have much depth and was all over the place. The characters were not as well developed as they could have been. I think this was suppose to be more of a comedy, but came of corny. I did enjoy the story, and although it had a slow start, it does get better, a little anyway. I just thought with a title like \\"The Greatest Lover in All England\\" it would be one of the best stories I read. Well the Greates Lover was a dunce most of the time, unless he was trying to use seduction. As a man in any other situation, he did not measure up. He had quite a \\"duh\\" capacity. Rosie was alright. Nothing special with her either.  <br />Not the worst I have read, not the best, but so far my least favorit of Dodds books so far.	2005-01-26

This was a heart pounding, whip you along, fast paced story. There was lots of action, great dialouge and chemistry between the characters. Sarah was a very strong girl when it came to Dominic, but very weak with her family. Even though she had alot of control in the house. I did not care for her character in the middle of the book. I know why she acted the way she did, but I thought she was really rough on Dominic when it was her own actionsand feelings that made her so mad. After that was resolved she was quite likeable again.  <br />Dominic was on the hard side. He had it rough, and was not going to take it any more. I thought there was a few too many holes in time. Example, she is riding her horse to get away from someone, then its two months later. Hello? What happened. Then when they took Dominic, you did not hear anything until he came back. none of this ruined anything, but if it was different, it would have been much better in my opinion. Otherwise this story has all of Robards usual eye holding action. I did enjoy this novel and would recommend it.	2005-01-26

With Wynter coming back from India, it definetly adds a differnt flavor. The way of life in India is abisouly not like life in England. Wynter adopted that life style for himself and his children. The differences with those two ways of life is why Adorna wants Charlotte to tutor Wynter. Only, Wynter does not need all this training. Some but not all. He plays his own game with his own reasons. I liked his unorthodoxed ways most of the time. Usually until he started going on about his \\"desert father\\" and his views on love and how they are suppose to treat their women. I would smack somebody for saying anything like that to me. He does realise his mistake, almost too late, and fixes it. Thanks to his mother.  <br />I really liked Charlotte. She was a great character. Strong and indipendent. Stood up for herself and did not take Wynters crap. She was a great character. Watching their battle of wills was highly entertaining. This book is highly recommended. Enjoy this great story.	2005-01-26

I have read many books by Mrs. Kleypas and this book just did not measure up to any I have read before. While on the surface it looks like this book has everything it needs to be good, its missing what makes it great. There could have been more chemistry between the characters. There was sexual tension, but not alot that lead to the deeper feeling that draw two people to eachother. Even though you know those deeper feeling are there somewhere, they remain elusive. Julia was a great character. She was strong enough to change what she did not like in her life and did not care about the consequences. She delt with them as they came to her. She was bubbly, smart, indepindent and strong. Not bird brained at all. Although at times she hid under her shell and really took some stuff. Like with Logan. Logan was a hard man and not that great of a friend really. With the advise he gave Julia, you almost have to know what happend to him so that way you dont end up not liking him. I will be getting his story as well. Maybe if he had some romantic reasons for being that way, the man does not see capable of feeling anything other then his love for the theater.  <br />Damon was a hard man. Strong willed and liked things to go his way and fit in the pattern that he thought was best. This makes for lots of tension between the two characters. Julia is one of the most indipendent women that I have read.  <br />So no, this book was not great it was not a total waste of time. Maybe if I had not read any of her newer books and know what she has the potential for, I would have like this alot more. Maybe because it is an older book, I really dont know. But if you like her newer books, stay away from this one. Its not like them at all.	2005-01-26
US	31888987	RN28PILY4M65T	0380802937	914283239	Someday My Prince	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Not so bad.	I have read both books in the series, how they are suppose to go. And yes, Dominic was not a good guy in the first book, but was not all that bad. Not as bad as some villans. He sparked interest in what would happen to him and his book jumps up 13 years. So, he is not the same. He is more of a ruthless character that has had the bad end of the stick for his whole life. You get a good background of Dom in The Runaway Princess and then in Someday My Prince, you get more of his story which is not a good one at all. Dom has led a hard life and did what he had to do to get by. Because of his life, it makes him an ok hero. He had to learn the hard way, but instead of being a really bad apple, he tried to keep whatever honest qualities that he could and still live his hard life. That is why he gets so hung up on giving his word. When that is all you have it has to mean something. I liked that he had a depth to his feelings that was like a hidden well. He was not the average hero, but neither was his pain. He could have been worse then he was and done worse. He stillhad some morals. I liked it, gave it five stars and would reccomend it as well.	2005-01-19

Started off on a swift ride, costing along with the story, then all the sudden, it falls apart. It was going good and I was thinking to myself that the other reviewers were wrong, and if this book was suppose to be bad compared to her other books, then she must be really good. Then I finished the book thinking man, they were right. What was she talking about. Sorry folks, on this book majority rules. I would have to then agree again and say try out a different story by this author. She is witty and even though this book could have been way better, it was not a waste of time. It was a Christmas story as well, so it has the spirit in it. Nick ws not that bad, actually it was the heroine who wore me out with all the lame excuses. But even she was not that bad. It was more the story line that fell apart. Weak effort.	2005-01-13

I have read all the dark hunter novels and my only complaint is that it takes SOOOOOOOOO long in between publication of the books. I need more sooner then every six months.   Well, all the DH books are awesome. This one is too. This story blew me away. See, you never really know what to expect because of all the ways these stories can branch off and who is in them and what elements the book is going to have depending on the characters. Weather they are Dark Hunters, Were Hunters or Dream Hunters. What they were back in their time, you just never know. Apolite or animal, the possibilities are endless.   In this book we have Valerius, the Roman mortal enemy of Kyran, and Tabitha who's twin is married to Kyran. We have met both these characters in past books, but we really get to know them in this book. There was such a deep look into these two that I almost could not stand it. It goes down into you and does unbelievable things. Valerius is a great hero. One of the best from this series. Maybe because you hear about him and his family through the whole series and then this book knocks everything you thought out the window and you understand so much to the point that it almost hurts. It changes everything that the characters opinions made you think. Valerius's story touched me deeply. Only Zarek came close in his story. I really enjoyed this book. It was one ringer after another. Nick, Tia, Then Desi coming back to finish what he started in Talons story, and then some. What the daimons did was sure a surprise. I cried more then once. This book has twists and turn that you never see coming. It is an unbelievable story and this series is one of the best that I have EVER read. This book was moving, funny, deep and a great addition to the series. Sieze the Night also opens more doors in the dark hunter world and tells more of its secrets. You learn alot in this book this is definetly a surprise. I had chills the whole time I was reading this book. There is not enough to sayand not enough words to explain it. It falls into its own unexplainable category where its so good, only there are no words to say how good. I hope the series goes and goes. Its got a while in it, you can tell, with how many options the author has because of all the different elements. I cant wait for the next book and will probally go over this one one more time. I read it in a day and want to make sure I did not miss even ONE thing. This book is one of the best in the series, definetly shocked the **** out of me. One thing, the very end could have been better, it was almost anit-climatic, but after what just happened in the story, I might not have been able to handle it. Yep, its that good people. Better then you could ever imagine.	2005-01-11

It also had it own little drama that while was big enough to be there, it was also light enough to fit in and give the book its edge. In the first book you are introduced to the characters Honor and Bram. you learn of Honors situation in the first book and see how sad Bram is cause of his dead wife. I think Bram was still a little too dramatic being that it was eight years sience his wifes death, and it was not the death itself, so much as his \\"questions\\" and then fear, that kept him from living. Maybe so much time should not have passed for that to be more plausable. Who knows. It did not kill the book or anything, Honor's story is pretty emotional and fits the scene. Kinda makes up what could be better as far as Brams reasoning. Honor is a good woman, no matter what the other reviews make her out to sound like. It was an OK book, kept a smile on my face and will have a spot on my keeper shelf for a while at least.	2005-01-10

It had some potential, but nothing came of it. Vanessa is whiney, immature, childish, annoying and selfish. The problems that she had with Parker to make her so scared are never clear. She never wants to talk about it or even think about it, so you never know what happened and what whe did talk about was not really all that bad to actually scare a woman. I though Nick was areally good guy. Why he stuck around for any of that is anyones guess. I liked Rodney. He was cool. And being that this is the first book that I have read by Linda, it does not give a good out look. The other reviews say that this is not her usual style and usually her books are not so crappy. I hope so. This wins the award of \\"Worst book read....EVER\\". Yep, its that bad.	2005-01-06

I originally saw the movie a few years ago and came across this book and had to get it. While it is not the \\"whole story\\" of their lives together, its a good look at it. The book is only just over 300 pages and that just cannot cover 14 years or whatever.  <br />There are such mixed reviews and this book is compared to so many other stories that I have not read. But I still liked this book. No way does it tell everything, who would write a book that gave away all their memories and left nothing sacred for you to look back on? <br />One thing, after reading the reviews for this book I have to say that alot of people are sad. Elvis was with Pricillia for years. She was his only wife. Come on, there was no way he hated her or was pushed into anything. Give it up. Actions speak louder then words and all that. I do not think she bashed Elvis with this book. I think she told her story, and maybe she did embelish it a little. Who is to say? Who else was there but them to know what happened? She showed that she loved him enough to live how he wanted her to. How she tried to be everything he wanted. It also shows how Elvis brought her into his life and how her transformation happened.  <br />Pricilla's writing is easy to follow and identify with. Obisouly it is going to be a one sided story, as Elvis is dead. Common sence, why would a superstar be with and marry a woman who he supposedly did not want to be with when he could have had anybody? Why did he not marry Ann Margret if she was his great love? Why did he keep going back to Pricilla if what he really wanted to do was let her go? Be real and let go of jealously. <br />I think that this shows a side of Elvis that no one would have known about if Pricilla did not share it. I fell in love with that side of him. Even if he was a little weird. Which he was. <br />I think that this is a good story and gives you a peak into Elvis's life from a point of view that no one else has. It is a good book and makes you want everythingto work out. Only you know that it wont. I think that Pricilla was a lucky woman who had one hell of a life with Elvis. A life that many others wished for themselves.	2005-01-06

It is on the lighter side, so it is funny and the plot flows for the most part. I did figure out who it was pretty early on, but that did not ruin any of the story because there was alot that I did not figure out. Their is the missing painting, a dead man in the library, and why all of this is going on in the sleepy town.  <br />The secondary story was good as well. Cant really go into that without telling most of the story.  <br />Some parts slowed down quite a bit, but then it would pick right back up and go mach speed. Over all I really liked the book and will look for more in the fucture.	2005-01-06

Sebastian was a hard character. Ruthless in getting what he wanted. Mary was able to take care of herself and stand up for her own. Lady Valery was one of the best characters in the book and I really enjoyed her antics. I liked all the characters in the novel, there was a reason to love them all. Except for the other Fairchild's. They were not so nice. But it was interesting to watch all their plots and plans unfold.  <br />It all starts over a missing diary that is a tell all and could ruin all kinds of things for different characters, making them desperate to get it back. But also making others desperate to have it to ruin those in it and Sebastian and Lady Valery as well. Its fun.  <br />Also, with the \\"forced seduction\\" it was definetly not rape. No, it was not. It was a harder scene and most people will not care for it, but it was not rape. It ws more about making Mary stop lying to herself and admit to the passion that her and Sebastian shared. He would not let her run or lie anymore. He made her face it and enjoy it. Which she did. It really showed that Sebastian was right and was really a turning point in their relationship. Personally, the scene did not bother me, I more felt what Mary felt and it was a heartbreaking realization for her. It was a good part of the story. Very emotional.  <br />Highly recommended.	2005-01-06

It is to Ian because of all the problems he has encountered because of it. Alanna is fighting for her right to keep her property of her beloved home to which she is mistress and had to leave so that she would not be forced to wed.  <br />I also have to say that the end put me through a ringer.

She is very explicit in her writing but not held back by the usual boundaries of a romance novel. I like how she is direct and bold. I like how she can make those scences just as hot if not hotter then the usual sex scene. This was a really good book. It has the hot sex and a good plot. Although the plot was not real aparent in the begining, it came out and was quite a gripping story. I did not give it 5 stars because it could have used a little more plot in ratio to the sex scenes.

I thought I would like it considering all the good reviews this book got. I think I read a different book then the rest of the people here. This book was boring. The beginning and the end were good The other 250 pages in the middle could have been deleted and the book would have been way better. The whole middle was stupid and boring. I had to make myself finish this book. I did not see any real conflict why they could not be together. The reasons they came up with were stupid. There was not alot of attraction to watch or see grow. Once they FINALLY got to any of the sex it was ok, but way too long in coming with no build up. The girls were cute. Al's love story was better then Jillian and Vince's story. This book was a bomb and if this is as good as it gets from this author, then I am getting out now while the getting is good. Too bad I already wasted my money on this book. IF I read her again, it will be from the library first. Do not reccomend.	2004-12-14

As the second book in the new series, it is good. And leads the way for more books in the series. Diana was a wonderful heroine. Strong and funny and able to hold her own against Thorne. Thorne is a strong male character. But he does not run over Diana. They build up a touching love story and I like how Thorne decides to get Diana. I found it interesting that in this book it was the woman who did not want marriage. I like the twist. It was fun to see how Thorne was going to work with that and how he was going to prove himself. There is tension from the plot to uncover the Guardians and Nate's murder. Guesing who is behind the spying and watching it all come together. It was not a huge mystery. But it fit in well. There was enough to keep you guessing while you got to watch the two sets of characters fall in love. I thought it was worth it. It was sweet, sensual and well worth the wait. Cant wait for the next book in the set. Looking foreward to it.	2004-12-09

It was deep and full of emotion, secrets and lots of feeling. I was not sure what to expect. Cy was an interesting hero. I thought he was really kinda mean at first, but its more that you have to get to know him and then you see why he is the way he is. Meridith was a strong heroine. She held her own and did not take Cy's stuff. She gave as good as she got. I liked it. The plot was good and considering that it was a board room book it kept you on the edge of your seat wondering what was going to happen at Tennison International, what Don is up to and with all the secrets between Cy, Meridith and Myrna, well, they all come out. You get to follow along and go for the same ride that all the characters go on. Mr. Smith was also very likeable. I liked him. I once read that Diana Palmer writes about \\"hard\\" men. That she does. Normally that is how I like them. Cy was just a little harder then I liked at times, but he was just as charming.	2004-12-09

So far I have not read a book by Christie Ridgeway that I have not liked. I fell head over heals for Yeager and Zoe. Deke and Lyssa were a treat as well.

I savored every page of this book like the best chocolate. I liked the setting, that island was magical and I would not mind visiting it myself if it really exists. Really, I cant say enough. Read it and you will understand.	2004-12-02

After reading the rest od her books, I have to say this book was not up to the standards of the rest of the books. It was rather shallow and then silly. It started out OK, a pretty wild plot about baby switching, but hey, I can take the odd, far reaching stories, as long as they are good. I have a pretty good imagination and read all kinds of books, paranormal included, so even though this was a really far fetched plot, I figured it would be good. I know how believable a plot is does not make a good book. Its the story. Everything all together. The problem is there is nothing to hold this story together. No bonding, emotion, love nada. The girls are cute. The body guard was a thorn in MY side. He really got to me. There is just no depth to the story what so ever. Its not a light read, its an empty read. I like light reads too, that is what I figured this was. But like I said, it was empty. Glad I have not run into anymore like this one. I hope this is the only bad apple there is.	2004-12-02

I liked the book but it was a bit...shallow Ill say. The writing was good as was the plot, but where it needed depth and more..whatever at the time, the story did not have it. The romance was there, but was almost flat. There was no spark that you got to hold onto. I didnt feel a really deep connection. Not that this was not an enjoyable read, it was, those were the things that bothered me.  <br />The mystery was good, the sex was good, although I did not believe Vivian was a virgin, she did not act like one at all. I think she should have had some expierence. I liked William and the details about everything. Ill be looking into other books and any new releases.	2004-11-30

I have not read a Lori Foster book that I did not love. I thought there could have been more details, but that could also be because I wanted the book to be longer. I was impatient for this book to come out, now I am inpatient for the next one already. Somehow, they need to come out faster. Lori Foster is one of the best authors there is out there. Anything she writes, you wont ever regret buying or reading it. Every book of hers that I have is on my keeper shelf. Where this one just earned a spot.	2004-11-24

I have read many Lisa Kleypas novels and have loved every one of them. Except for this one. I thought the pace of the plot was slow and not deep enough. Too light. Maybe it was because the book was originally written over 10 years ago, but it is not like her newer books. I have not read the original of this book Only In Your Arms, and I dont think I will either. The characters were not real enough for me either. It was Ok really, I just think it could have been better considering how good her later books are in comparison with this one. I had no trouble reading it, the story flowed and the sex was OK. But once I was done reading the story, it just could have been way better. I just did not really notice until I was done and gathering my thoughts and formulating an opinion. Ok read, but I would go to the library. From now on, Im sticking to newer stories.	2004-11-24

I am a lover of Connie Mason books and buy them without looking at the back. I see her name, I buy. In my opinion, this book was ok. I did like it, it was a page turner and had me speed reading through it waiting for what was happening next. Then, when I was done, it was kinda like, thats it? I was not really surprised by anything that happened. I was able to predict most of the book. That bothered me. Normally I am in for a wild ride with Masons books and am looking one way, when it sould be another. Not this time. So, I am disapointed, I expected more. But I am not discouraged. I will get more of Connies books, I just hope they are bette then this one.	2004-11-22

I found myself trying to read slower so the story would last longer. This book did have more detail then usualy Lisa books, but it did not hurt the story at all. The characters were well drawn out. The plot was light and left room for laughs. This story gives you a glimps into the next books with the other girls. I think the next story will be great too. Needless to say, not like every other book she wrote, but just as enjoyable. Will be looking for next new releases.	2004-11-19

Hot number was as good as the rest. I liked the characters and the plot. I thought it was funny. When you get to see how the \\"mix-up\\" happened, you see how it could happen. Not so far fetched. I thought the author could have shown more of the growth of the rebudding romance then she did, but it was still there. The sex scenes were pretty good too, Ive read better, but Ive also read way worse. That kinda falls into the could have been more. I liked it either way. This is a very enjoyable author. This is a light, fun, fast paced-page turner. It was funny and sweet and I have to say that one of my favorite parts of the book is the end. The twist. Funny. Enjoy!!	2004-11-16

I liked the hero, Luke. He was great. Merry is a good woman. Strong, loyal and loving. Like I said, I liked the first better, but this was a good second book that fit well.

The love story was magical and the who-done-it had me going. Having read mysteries for years before romance books, well, thats a job well done. I kept thinking, \\"I know who did it now\\" then something else would happen. I would then find myself thinking \\"Well, then it was this one....\\"  <br />From the begining to end, you are drawn into the story. The whole story line is this.... Aveline is living in the country with her gambling father. Needless to say, her father has a problem and is always pushing them close to poverty. Well, in one card game one night, he dishonors Lucien, who is a crackshot and has not lost one of his many duels. So, Aveline figures she will pay the notorius rake a visit and see if she cant bargin for her fathers life. Her mother died several years ago, so her father is the only thing that keeps her off the streets. (She takes care of getting food and stuff.)But what she bargins with is not money, besides, she does not have enough money to cover then debt. Hence, the three nights. Now, fast foreward to five years from now. Here goes the story of deception and betrayal and how these two fall in love all over again while overcoming all these problems. People trying to keep them apart and they are fighting all these outside sources and their own doubts and fears. The only thing is how they go over and over again their thoughts and feelings. The problem, was they were the same. Over and over again. Its not bad when the thoughts change, but 3 out of 5 intorspective parts, sounded like the one before. Then it changes, then the same, same, same. That grated my nerves, but I just skipped over those parts. Otherwise, this book was great. It was a great tale and I enjoyed the ride.	2004-11-12
US	31888987	R1Z1WC1AGIY3OC	044661114X	217054040	Lone Rider	Books	3	3	3	N	N	So, so	I thought the book started out really good. The biker gang and getting kindapped. That was good and exciting. No suspense though really. But then it was over and so quickly too. I thought the kidnapping with the biker gang could hae been just a little better and longer. The book slowed down alot after all that. It was almost silly.  <br />There was Tess and the plot. For a \\"strong, independent, striking-out-on-her-own\\" woman, she sure turned into an obsessed with her kidnapper, weak-willed whiner. A virgin at twenty whatever because she is waiting for Mr. Right, but did not hesitate so get it on with her kidnapper. It was just made out to be too important, when it obisously was not. Then the plot, the poor plot. The whole story had so much potential, but it fell through short. It had more then holes. More like entire sections ripped out. I love romance books and am open bout lots of stuff. I forgive many mistakes, as long as it is made up somewhere else. I can go along with hard to believe and far fetched. Thats what I read for, ya know? I LIKE made up stories, I like the authors imagination, but not something like this. This kind of stuff I cant handle. What happened to the business Tess had? What about all the stuff in her car? What about her parents? What about her life that you never really get told about? What about Greys life that you never get told about? The end was just too convient. Did Greys parents have any part in it at all? Cause you never see them, you hear about them a few times. Thats it. There were so many problems with the story line. Grey was ok, nothing spectacular. I liked him better as Dallas. He was better in that character. Interesting how that happened cause he was the same person but you can hardly tell. I think that with time and a few more books under her belt this author will be great. Once she gets everything right the stories will be dyanmite. It did have promise, some parts were good, and the sex scenes were hot. She has that part ofher writing down pat. Now, character development, way better plot with just a little bit of depth, and we might make it somewhere. So, even though I found this book way wacked, I am going to check out later books and reviews and see if she made herself yet. I hope she does, shell have good books if she can get it right.	2004-11-10

This is only the second book by EL that I have read, but it was almost as good as the first book of hers that I have read. Cat is an amazing woman. She is independent, warm, funny, determined and driven. Travis is OK too. I didnt like how he kept jumping from liking Cat to torturing her by accusing her constantly of using him. I guess it is understandable, at least to a point, why he is that way. Dont get me wrong, he has a deep well of emotions inside of him and that makes him human to the reader. When he wasnt putting thughts into his own head because he was so scared, he was a great man. Really great.  <br />There was one part of the plot that I thought was really stupid. It really bothered me. And that was the part of the reason Cat had to work so hard was to pay for her mothers bills. Helping pay for her sisters medical school is good for the plot, it fits and is believeable. Grants dont cover much and its easy to see why they would not work as well. Its medical school. But to work yourself to the bone, get sick and be unhealthy for years because your mom wont stop shopping? Because she was spolied and cant figure out her check book. Then to leave raising your kids to one of your other kids, that is just too irresponsible. No mother I know would do that to their kid. I thought the author could have come up with something better then a selfish mother who does not care to raise her children. Why couldnt she have been sick? Had a real reason to not be able to take care of things instead of she cant stop shopping? So, that smacked of stupidity to me. But that would have to be my only complaint. The rest of the book was wonderful. From the first page to the last page. The story sucked you in and pulled you along. It is very realistic. Very. There are many ways that I connected with the story. Feel the happiness and that pain. I have to admit, I shed more then a tear at the sad part. I was also extatic at the happy parts. This book was very emotional and touching. Shows love at its best and some of the worst. Like I said, very real. Nothing in real life is perfect, and thsi follows along those lines. Great story. Highly recommended!	2004-11-10

I sped through this page turner laughing like a hienea. The plot is more far fetched then unbelieveable. It could happen. Thats what stories are for, right? Someone elses imagination is us readers entertainment. This book is not deep or very complicated. It is light and funny. Its not all about lust, it is more how men and lust equals love. A man who does not admit to what he really feels, you know the hard headed, cant look deeper then the surface type who run when things start going somewhere. Only he cant run. Cant do it. So, it is interesting to see how she is going to get out of her situation. And what is he going to do, considering what he knows. Dont go in expecting Linda Howard or anything. This is alot lighter, more like knee slapping funny. So its worth it. I enjoyed it and will read more titles under this author. A nice excape for sure.	2004-11-09

I think this was the best story out of all three and I loved every one of them. Ben turned out to be an amazing man. Absolutly wonderful. It is really sad that this is the last book of the trilogy. Linda definetly saved the best for last and I hope there are more like this one out there or comming. This was a magical tale of love and was wonderfully written. It had everything. It was funny and the characters were written great. You got to see them grow themselves and grow together. Ben is more of a \\"real\\" man then you usually see in a character. And knowing Julia from the past two books, you get real insight into her, her life and choices. I cant say enough about this book. Ben was a dream. At the end, the last two or three chapters, had me falling all over myself. I could only dream of someone so insightful. The chemistry was enough to make me jealous and I cried at what he did for her. I had to go back and read it again. Then one more time. Needless to say, this is going on my keeper shelf, is now one of my favorites and I will read it multiple times. Its a page turner too. Like I said I cant say enough. I love everything abou it. There is too much praise for this book, this book is one that makes you wish.........	2004-11-09

This is another funny, light, page-turning romance. Jack is a great character in this book, Dr. Jeckel, as he is refered to. Very amusing to watch the antics of the \\"switched specimen\\" between the brothers. I liked this book and the original story. The romance was sweet as well. I though it could have been a little hotter, it did have all the potential and plenty of spots for it, but it was not there. They still conected well and you still got to watch the budding romance.

When I finished this book I had to take a few minutes to breath because my heart was still pounding. My heart was pounding throught the whole book for one reason or another. There is not one thing that I did not like in this whole book. Dee was wonderful. I loved her character more then any other in the book. She was a wonderful woman. Her character was great. I dont think I have read of a heroine that I have ever liked more then Dee. Lucas was great too. I loved to see their wills crash and watch the sparks fly. You got to see the feelings between them grow and it was really amazing. This story was real and the characters were alive. Dee had so much spunk. I loved to watch her battle Lucas and win.  <br />It was also nice to see Luis from A Lady of The West. That was really nice to see that he was happy at the end of this book after what he went through in A Lady. There is nothing this book did not have. The characters are great, main and supporting. The plot is good and the story to fill it is magical. I felt at home in Angel Creek and if only there was really a place like that. This was a fairy tale for me. Im so glad that I found this book, it will keep me company for many years to come.	2004-11-04

I had looked at the reviews and was not sure how this book would be. Hearing how he hit her and all he did was \\"want\\" her and all that. I thought the story would have Jake as the biggest butt and Victoria as weak willed, under Jakes thumb. Not so, was the case. It took just a little while to get started, but once I got through the first 30-50 pages, it all came together and took off on a wild ride. I loved the lead heroine. Vicotria was great. She did not take Jake's crap and gave as good as she got. Yes, Jake does hit her but first of all, it did flow with the story line, he did not get away with it what so ever. He never thought it was OK. No, none of it makes it right, but you can see how it fits in there and the outcome the action is surprising. Yes, Jake did talk an aweful lot of \\"wanting\\" Victoria, but it was to the point of obsession, something the reader should be able to figure out is not just lust. That he does want not just her, but all of her, and  that he equates feelings with sex. So, while you know how Victoria feels, you have to look at Jakes actions to see how he feels. Very intraciate. I love how it all got blended in together. Jake was very dominate, but such a sweetheart, I couldnt help but love him. It took me not even a day to read this book. Near the end of the book I cried. When it was over wanted it to go on for just a few more chapters. This book is not like her newer releases, not a romantic suspense. The story does have its own darker plot, but nothing too serious. This book was great! I loved it and it will go on my keeper shelf. I dont know when I will get to read it again, it made such an impression, I dont think I am likely to forget this story any time soon. Victoria is one of my all time favorite heroeins. I really liked her, Jake was a great guy too. Usually the guy is too much of something, overbearing, rude, mean, too cockey, something, not Jake. And Victoria was strong and very likeable. They had an underlying heat through out the whole story. You could feel it. Please get this book and you'll love it. As long as you dont expect it to be like every other story (I dont know why people do that. Stories are suppose to be different with different plots.) Lady of The West has it all.	2004-11-03

The only Christina Dodd books I have read, is this one and the next one on the series, Almost like being in love, and if these books are \\"bad\\" compared to normal, then she has a fan for life. I thought they were great, ergo, can only get better, right? The two totally different plots did not bother me, I loved both stories and men and plots and supporting characters. I could not put it down and got very upset with any disruptions. Because of these books, I will read much more of her. I loved it.

He was like most men out there, I guess he was just \\"too\\" real for me. Only some of the time, dont get the wrong idea, this book was good. He just agrivated me sometimes. I still liked it.

It was funny, oh so funny! I couldnt stop laughing. How I love stories like this one. I liked the supporting characters and the plot was great. When Lydia and Luke got together the sparks just flew, and it was hot. My cheeks got red. This has been one of the best books that I have read in a while. I will be getting more, and I hope they are as good as this book is. Seems to me from the reviews on her books, you either love them or dont.

While it was not the best book I have ever read, it was still enjoyable. There were details left out and it could have been put together more. I espically think that the end needed more, I wanted there to be more. Really bad. But I still liked it. It had my heart pounding and I couldnt put it down. Pepper does have a REALLY BIG chip on her shoulder, but she is not totally unlikeable. Just when she goes off on her tangents. Maybe the military stuff is a little far fetched, but for all we know, it could be more advanced then even that. I dont think anyone really knows what weapons our Special Forces units have, till after they have used them and gotten new ones. Does not seem like something that would be out there for everyone to read up on all the facts. Ya know? It is the top, most dangerous, advanced and all that of the Army. Even if it is a little made up, that is what we all read for right? A story. A fictional story. Some elements did match up really well and you could identify with them and their feelings at times. I will read the rest of the books in the series and even check out some of her historicals. This was a gripping story and I loved the effect it had on me. Oh, Dan does use the term \\"mating\\" more then necessary in my opinion. Like he was a stalion and she a mare. Odd, really. Didnt know what to make of it.	2004-10-27

I really did not like Ryan. I cant even use the right word to describe him. It was also really confusing. All over the place. Love scences were rushed and not all that great anyway. The end had some ok parts. It was definetly better then the first half but not by much. I really did not care for this book, I thought I would like it. I figured it would be good, I have read her under Laura Renken, but this writing was terrible. Nothing like LR. Weird. I might get the second book, I might not.

I have read all three book in the series and although this was not the best on in my opinion, it was still a good book.

Sience LR is not planning to do any more books in the series, there are too many things left undone at the end of the book. Loose ends that should have been  tied up.

It was a fairy tale, but a good one. Mick was not all that bad, I really liked him actually. He was a really good guy. Winnie was a great character too. The story is like some fairy tales, but it has its own elements that make it different. He's a good guy trying to make his way, and she is fighting herself for what she feels deep inside. And it was her idea to show her legs, if he shaved his mustache. I thought the scene was cute. And Mick does not talk like that through out the whole book. The way he speaks changes in the book, kinda the point of him being with Winnie. It was my first book by this author, and I like it.	2004-10-18

I almost had to break my own arm to finish reading it. See, here's the thing. There are some really good moments with the plot. Some of it was engaging and humerous. Thats it. I did not like the characters, their personalities, what little of their lives you see beyond the story. They were not alive enough. Grace grated a nerve, Magnus or whatever was a jerk half the time and Eliza was a ninny. I finished it so that I could see if it got any better at all, but although it was a very promising story, it flatlined in my book. I would not recommend this book to anyone. If curiosity wins out, got to the library. Dont waste money.	2004-10-13

I really am looking foreward to Julie and Ben's story. But, this book was wonderful. It really gave you a much better look at Chloe and why she is the way she is. I liked watching Sterling grow in the story and watching all the things Chloe did to try to get off the show was great. I like the secondary characters as well and am hoping to see Serina in Ben's story. She was very loveable. Also, it tells us a little about Jesse and Kate from the previous story, which I love. You get to share all their lives. And it has already set the stage for Ben and Julia, which I hope will give us a much better look at Julia. In this book, you see more into her character and it makes you wonder...... This book was funny, sexy, down to Earth, great tale. Looking for the next and waiting still after that. Cant wait to see whats next. Get it and enjoy.	2004-10-11

It was different and I did not read the first book in the series (did not know there was one, but its in an anthology anyway).

The story grabed you from the beginning and takes you on a ride. This being the first book from this author that I have read, I will look for more of her books. I get the feeling I wont be disapointed. Christian is truly one of the best hero's that I have read in a while. He was a good guy, I wouldnt mind one of him for myself. He pulls at your heartstrings.

This is the first and only book that I have read by this author and I loved it. I like learning about new things too, so all the info about the cave exploring was not so bad. Gives you a different perspective, sience most people dont know all that much about caves and climbing. It really was not so bad. I really fell in love with these characters. It in on my keeper shelf to say the least. Maybe one day when I read it again, my opinion might change, but I liked it.	2004-10-05

I had never herd of Toni Blake, but the back of the book drew me in and I bought it. It was a very good book. But I thought that the end should have told us more about if anything was resolved between Nick and his father. It was such a big issue, but it didnt have any closeur. I felt like there was more, but that was it. I did want the book to keep going. I have to say one of my favorite parts of this book was the other half of the end. Where he tries to get her back.

I have not read any of the anthology stories, only because I do not usually read anthologies. Dont like 'em. But Im thinking about going to the library to get them to get the rest of the Wilde stories. I thought this book was pretty good, being that the main plot was Scott trying to get Ashley to be with him forever, and Ashley having a reality check that took too long to click. It also struck a nerve how Ashley could act and Scott just accepted it. Other wise, it was good.	2004-09-23

The plot and everything was good, the story was fine, it was more the immature actions and stupid reasoning to make it all ok that got to me. When Molly and Carey got along you could see the chemistry between them, even though the \\"love\\" scenes are not what they are in more recent books, there was still a sweetness. But, for how much it got to me, I did not put it down, my curiosity too piqued, I had to know what was going to happen in the end. So, it was pretty good. I have to admit, I kinda really likes Carey at times. Would not mind on of him for myself. Read it for your self, then youll know what I mean. It is a good book, but wont be staying on my keeper shelf.	2004-09-22

I just got done reading this book, thankfully it ended my bad book run. I had the second book in this series, only I did not know they were connected till a few minutes ago when I went to do my review and read that My Lord Pirate is the first book. Well, I sold the second book, not knowing what I had and just kicked myself you know where for getting rid of it, so I ordered the second book again, as well as the third. I loved this book and read it in practically one day. If I could have stayed awake any longer, I would have finished it. This book had so many twists and turns, Talon is woow baby. I wish. I highly recommend this book, if you can find it, and the other two too. I have not read the third book yet, but I have no doubt it will be as good as the first and second. I will definetly be reading this book again, probally all of them, to do the series justice. I didnt want it to end. Help us all if books like these keep coming out.	2004-09-22

I thought this was a good first book for a new series. \\"New\\" being the key word. Some people read this thinking it would be like those books, and disappointed because its not. Well, its not. The book is a good beginning book. It has a good story line, hot like Feehans books are and it gives you a good idea of how the series is going to go on. Its got its suspense and then was so funny I was laughing out loud. Its an opener, a good one. Lily is a sweetheart and Ryland is a good man. I love the rest of the team and will keep reading this series. I have read the second book too, Mind Game and thought it was a good continuation of the Ghostwalker story and loved Nicolas and Dahlia. The series is promising and good. But not like the Carpathian books. They are addicting in their own way.	2004-09-14

There is not all that much that you can say without giving it all away, its all inter-connected. This was a wonderfully written story. This book wow'ed me completly. I ordered it on-line and when I got it, I was reading another book, but I flipped through it to get a peak. I kinda cheated, but that just made me want to read it more. Then when I got to read it, I could not put the book down all day. I was falling asleep or else I would have read it in one day. This book touches on forbidden desires, only takes it to a different level. Very dark, but at the same time, its the love. The overpower of love. Love and obsession. You can almost see your self getting cought up in the same kind of situation as Alice with Adam. What would it be like to be loved like that? Adam's character was brilliant and the telling of the story......you have to read it your self. Its dark things, that are \\"not suppose to\\" turn people on, but Adam was so intense, so sincere, I was not sure what to think. I have not had a book affect so many emotions, ever. It was almost a heartbreaking story, I felt it wrench inside. I almost cried when I finished the book. I felt as lost as Alice. It really made you get in there and feel with them. I will be reading this again and consider it a prize to my keeper collection. I highly reccomend this book, but only to people who are not faint hearted. While the sex is not very detailed, there are scenes where it is violent. More the idea, but your brain knows where to take it. But, the violent sex is needed for the story. Not all the sex is violent, but enough to where more touchy types would whine about the content. Personally, I ABSOLUTLY LOVED THIS STORY.	2004-09-09

I gave it 4 stars because it was pretty hot, but the plot was almost non-exsistant till over 200 pages in the book. I do not think it was better then On A Wild Night, or Wicked Dawn. I was really looking foreword to this book, and thought it was a huge let down. I will keep reading her books, but now I am wary. The end was much better then the first 2/3 of the book. The first 2/3 of the book is pretty much self-reflection on the characters parts, and while that is usually well and good, there is also usually a more interesting plot to go with it. Not so in this book. The plot was so flimsy, I could not find it till the end got going. Pretty sad. I am devoted to the Cynster series and read the books faithfully. The rest of the series is on my keeper shelf, I am still deciding weather or not to keep it, or get rid of it.	2004-09-02

This is one of the best book series I have read. I just got buy the books, I dont read the back. Julian was sexy and his story made my heart twist. Espically that part at the end.........which I will not tell you about. I could not believe it though. And the ending rolled from there. This book was a not-put-downable at all.

I can say that I am glad that these three stories got put in the same book, made it much more enjoyable and the stories just flowed into one another, so it was like a continous book. You still got to watch the characters grow in all the stories. Each and everyone of them was hot. My favorite was Chase. Yep, thats why. Once you read the book, youll know.

I am putting it on my keeper shelf and telling everyone I know about this book. No, the story with the weapons and bad guys was not all that involved, it was enough, to keep the book from being nothing but hot and heavy sex. But, no complaints. That book was hot, even if it had some elements that are not in a &quot;normal&quot; romance. It was still one of the best books that I have read. It was a page turner that got read in one day. And ya, like one reviewer comented that Seth was on the weirdo side, you get to watch how that obsession turns into something more. We wont call it beautiful, but I guess it is in its own way. Personally, Seth made my mouth water. Raine tried to handle him as best as she could. I liked it. Porn, erotica, whatever. Remember, there is a little story line. It is a dynamite book that you should go get and read. I will read it again, adn get her other books. I just started Standing in the Shadows. Although, I think I still like Seth better. I dont think any book could be like that one. Even others from S.M. But I will be on the lookout. Enjoy!	2004-07-23

I thought the ending could have been a little better, it turned kinda cheesy, but only the very end. It just seemed that with so much going on in the rest of the book, all the feelings and passion, that their would have been more of an impact on the reader at the end. But it was still real good.

Normally, I do not like the cheating but some reviewers made it sound alot worse then it really is. The scene was heartbreaking and real, which is why I thought it did the book good. It really is not all that bad. It more fits in with the story. Its the slap that Niall needed and its not like Sabrina let him walk all over her. She is a very strong heroine and Niall is a great hero. I look foreward to her next book with baited breath. I cant wait. And if you have read the reviews and are discouraged, don't be.

Morgan and Luca are explosive and well defined characters from the begining. Morgan is on a revenge mission that has lasted for years. For Morgan it is not enough. In Luca he sees an opportunity for more. But alas, Luca is not what Morgan expects and neither are his feelings for the firey, curageous Luca. Even while he is lying to himself about his strong reaction to her, all because of her Spanish blood, he cannot let her go and almost looses her while at court, leaving her stached in the country. Luca is all woman and Morgan affects her in such a way she is not sure how to handle it at first, but settles into her wanton reactions to Morgan soon enough. It is a wild ride and had my heart beating fast. I couldn't wait to read the whole story and will be reading it many more times in the future. It's a hot adventure and one wild ride. I am a big fan of Connie Mason and I give this one five stars! Can't wait for the next.	2003-11-06

This was one of the best books that I have had the pleasure to read in a long time. And it was a pleasure. A page turner, there was always something happening. Either a good battle of wits, a contest of wills, or lots of action. All kinds of action. The caracters were very real and easily related to. With a good kick of humor to liven things up. I dont know about you, but it made me want to jump into the book and sail away. I would definetly recomend it to anyone who was looking for a good book. And I look foreward to her next book and the one after that too. Very impatently, I might add. So, when you pick it up, make sure you have lots of time.
