Like most of Loren Estleman's writing, this novel seems predestined to never get the readership it deserves.<br /><br />Despite a trunk full of glowing critical reviews, the great mass-audience that eludes the author will see in this latest effort only a \\"genre\\" novel, and a \\"western\\" at that. The author, thank heavens, doesn't seem overly bothered by this, though, and continues to produce some of the richest reading in print.<br /><br />Esleman's books are small, perfect gems, nearly always under 300 pages. Within these pages, always, are perhaps the best passages of dialogue that I have ever read and immense histories told perfectly with grace, melancholy, and precision. Consider the following description of late 19th century San Francisco as put down in a letter in \\"The Undertaker's Wife\\":<br /><br />\\"It seems the city itself is nothing more than one of those ancient fountains in Europe, into which one casts a coin, makes a wish, and retires, uncertain as to whether the boon will be granted, but certain one's purse is lighter for the attempt.\\"<br /><br />Rich period details abound in this novel, which tells the life story of an undertaker and his wife (Estleman may be the patron saint of unappreciated professions, considering the subject matter of this book and his earlier and egually brilliant \\"The Master Executioner\\"). The heroine of this story, and the subject of the title, is a character that nearly pulses of the page with passion and subtlety. Like any worthy writer, Estleman brings characters to life with a few deft strokes, and I guaranty you that both the undertaker and his wife, along with several satellite characters, will be placed in your memory as if they had lived. I cannot remember any book that has brought the character of James \\"Wild Bill\\" Hickock to such vibrant life as does Estleman in this novel.<br /><br />If you like Westerns you already know about this author and his work. If, however, you have stumbled upon this review because you were intrigued by the title, whereupon you experienced disappointment learning that it was \\"only a Western\\", I urge you to buy it and read it. Estleman never, ever disappoints any lover of the English language. -Mykal Bantase you were intrigued by the title, whereupon you experienced disappointment learning that it was \\"only a Western\\", I urge you to buy it and read it.

I had never read this author but gave it a try on the strength of an interesting blurb on the back cover: Briefly put, a German U-boat, patrolling the waters of the American coast, is badly damaged and must seek harbor in the bayous of Louisiana. Here, the crew encounter the isolated Cajun trappers that live in the swamp and have little to do with the outside world. The Cajun clan will help the Germans for a price. Time is very short. Every day the U-boat lays in the heat-filled swamp, they risk detection. There is also a battle of wits and wills between the German U-boat captain, Kurt Stuermer, and the ruthless, mad leader of the Cajuns, Papa Luc.<br /><br />The great strength of this novel is its involved but smooth plotting, which the author, John Mannock, handles very well. Mannock introduces many characters from many backgrounds, included a British officer, a Cajun witch, a German U-boat captain, and a war-wounded American tug boat captain in a downward spiral of self-destruction, together very nicely. Although the book takes many turns and surprises (and I do mean many), Mannock brings the reader along at just the right pace so the work never feels either rushed or sluggish. This might be considered a \\"techno-thriller\\" as the technical aspects of sub life are important in the telling of the story (and interesting to a Submarine fan like me), but really the characters, not the gadgets, are the focus and interest of this author (unlike Clancy who always casts hardware in the starring roles). Mannock is too much of an old-fashioned storyteller to spend too much ink on the metal.<br /><br />This book delivered on the interesting back cover blurb in spades. I found myself very much caught up and pulling for several of the characters at once. There are interesting stories-within-stories here that really make this a great, meaty summer read - and maybe just a bit more. - Mykal Banta	2005-06-24

Scott Fitzgerald once said that there were no second acts to American lives. Yet, a fellow Irishman (one much less gloomy) proved him very, very wrong.<br /><br />This book is the homage that James J. Braddock has always deserved. Braddock's amazing story has been slowly fading from public memory, as well as the memory of modern boxing fans, steadily over the years. This book puts things right.<br /><br />Author, Jeremy Schaap, has written a Godsend of a book for Braddock fans, and his clean, direct style is perfectly suited to telling this story. If Schaap were a boxer, he would be referred to as a cagey, \\"cute\\" fighter; meaning that it might appear that he isn't doing much, but what he does counts and he will be there at the end of the fight with his glove raised.<br /><br />To put it another way, there is nothing prosy in Schaap's writing; but he really knows the way to hit the right spots. Like any very good writer, he recognizes true moments of drama and plays these moments with a pure economy of words that come at you from the blue. Bang! Suddenly I found myself very moved and didn't even see it coming.<br /><br />James J. Braddock was in so many ways the perfect product of the Great Depression. He was a washed-up fighter, his best years behind him. He had been cleaned out by the depression, desperately trying to feed his family by taking odd jobs at the docks in New Jersey, even going on relief (which so humiliated him he wouldn't tell anyone, not even his mother). Yet dock work had made him lean and tough, so when his second chance came, the hard knocks of life had prepared him.<br /><br />People loved him not because he was white, or Irish. Americans loved him because he was like them - all of them - and he represented a hope. He had been crushed and humiliated by life, yet he did not quit. He literally fought his way back. One of the most telling moments in the book, described beautifully by the author, was when Braddock walked into the pubic relief office. He had the amount that he had been given in cash in his pocket, and he wished to pay it back.<br /><br />While this book is a pleasure for the mainstream reader, hard-core fight fans will have nothing to complain about either. His descriptions of the fights of Braddock's career make it plain the author knows his boxing as well. As an unexpected bonus, Schaap has portraits of many other fighters that entered Braddock's sphere; among them Primo Carnera, Max Bear and the great light-heavy, Tommy Laughran.<br /><br />This book is a long-needed and wonderful portrait of a champion, as well as an important addition to boxing literature.ubic relief office.

Author, Patrick Myler, a great boxing historian, found himself a great subject: the second Joe Louis - Max Schmeling fight in 1938. Has there ever been a sporting event filled with such natural potential for drama? Max Scheming, the glowering \\"Black Ulan from the Rhine\\" promoted by non other that Nazi Propaganda Minister, Joseph Goebbels as the shinning example of racially pure German manhood, vs. Joe Louis, the poor black, sharecroppers son from Alabama. Add to this mix the fact the Schmeling had completely dominated Louis in a previous meeting, handing the Brown Bomber his only defeat on his seemingly unstoppable march to the heavyweight championship.<br /><br />And what a fight it was. There has probably never been such fine destruction machine as was Joe Louis that night. Not even Iron Mike at his best could rival the ruthless savaging that Louis turned loose on the German. Watching a film of it this many years later, it still captures the viewer in a kind of primal terror. It looks for all the world like someone literally being beaten to death. The lack of sound only increases the horror, watching Schmeling screaming silently as Louis delivers body blows. By the end of the fight, Louis had literally broken his back as well as his spirit: Schmeling suffered three fractured vertebra.<br /><br />The problem I have with the book is that Myler doesn't harness the natural drama of the event. The focus and pace of the book is all wrong, with the fight itself occupying a single chapter in the middle, with the bulk of the book describing the contrasting careers of the two fighters. The author, in fact, seems determined to tell his story without flare. In quoting the great sports writers of the day, like Grantland Rice and Henry Mclemore, Myler hopes to give us an example of the overheated prose of the day. \\"What such sensitive souls seemed to forget, or chose to ignore, was that Louis was simply doing a job, and doing it to the best of his ability,\\" sniffs the author.<br /><br />Louis just \\"doing a job\\"? Nonsense. Louis often said himself that by the time he climbed into the ring, he hated the German. Further, Louis admitted that Schmeling was the only man he had consciously wished to hurt during a fight. Louis was doing something much more than simply delivering a professional job of boxing. Watch the film of the fight if you ever get the chance. Joe wasn't simply trying to win a boxing contest. He was trying to punish the German as brutally as possible.<br /><br />What Myler has forgotten in this book is something men like Grantland Rice lived by:  readers love drama. Ironically enough, the passages from the old sports writing greats, while included dismissively, are the most passionate and exciting in the book.<br /><br />So why give it four stars? Because Myler is an extremely worthwhile boxing historian, and he manages to give a very interesting portrait of the two combatants. By books end, Max Schmeling emerges as a man of great integrity and class. He risked much in Nazi Germany, using his status as national sports hero to save many Jewish friends from the death camps, even hiding two Jewish friends in his house during Kristallnacht. When pressed by Goebbels to fire his Jewish manager, Joe Jacobs, he flatly refused.<br /><br />I learned much about Joe Louis as well. Myler describes all of Louis' well-known flaws: the womanizing, the utter failings as husband and father, the drug addiction, all told without flinching. Yet Myler manages to convey the thing about Joe Louis that was touching as well. He was always flatly honest, whether giving an opponent in the ring credit or admitting his own failings as a father, husband, and ultimately a man.<br /><br />By the end of their lives, the two former foes were close friends. Schmeling always sent Louis money over the years, through all of Joe's business and tax troubles, and in fact seemed to genuinely love the man who had once broken his back in the ring. Myler missed the mark on the drama of the fight, but the lives of the two fighters he does up very nicely. -Mykal Bantaler missed the mark on the drama of the fight, but the lives of the two fighters he does up very nicely. -Mykal Banta  <br />	2005-06-01

Fatherland is an absolutely brilliant novel and one of the most exciting and thought-provoking books I have every read. If this sounds like gushy over-praise, please trust me; it isn't. This book simply fires on all cylinders. If you are looking for a thrilling, nail-biter that will keep you turning pages past you bedtime, this is it. If you are looking for a novel with rich characters that will move you in their believability, here it is. If you are looking for a work that will fire up your intellect, order this book now. You will not be disappointed. Superbly conceived mystery? You got it. All rendered at a pitch-perfect pace that doesn't drag for a single paragraph.<br /><br />Harris is simply a great writer. I don't mean a good thriller writer (though that would certainly be enough); I mean he is a writer that has that little bit extra that makes you remember his work years later. The conception and sweep of this novel is extraordinary. The time frame for the work is the early sixties. Germany has won WWII, and American President Kennedy is scheduled to meet Adolph Hitler at a summit in Berlin to discuss a d&eacute;tente between the two nations. Against this backdrop, Berlin detective, Xavier March, is called in to investigate a death. What happens after that unfolds in ever darkening layers of danger. March begins to move through the bleak, nightmare world of Berlin, where massive, Teutonic architecture towers over the streets and records are kept of skull shapes to insure racial purity.<br /><br />I don't want to give away too much. This is the kind of work a reader should discover for themselves. When I read the back jacket of this paperback, which describes a \\"disillusioned but talented investigator\\" solving a mystery with the help of a \\"beautiful American journalist,\\" it sounded slightly hackneyed, but it was just a case of some publicity genius at Ballintine underselling both the book's readership and the author. Xavier March is one of the most vivid, heroic, and memorable characters I've come across in fiction. By the end of the book, I was right there with him, pulling for him so hard it made my teeth ache. As for \\"Charlie\\" Maguire, her physical appearance is the last thing that comes to mind. What I remember is her quick temper, her stubbornness, and the brave way she manages to control her growing fear as she comes to realize she is onto much more than a good story. Her terror is palpable, and so is her strength. \\"I hated you on sight,\\" she tells Detective March at one point, and means it. Her growing love for this rigid, Nazi detective, and his need for her, is done in expert, subtle strokes. By the end of the novel, and after considering it for a bit, I realized I had just read one of the most moving love stories in memory.<br /><br />I found this book, much to my surprise, profound.

He has a real knack for increasing both brain cell activity as well as the pulse rate, and Archangel is another book in the slowly increasing Harris titles that will absolutely keep you up late turning the last 100 pages.<br /><br />It is difficult to speak about the plot without giving away too much. Basically, a historian, well passed his glory years, stumbles upon the possibility of a very valuable and reputation-saving diary left by the Man of Steel himself, Joseph Stalin. As the historian, Fluke Kelso (what a great name for a has-been), begins to investigate, it becomes very clear that certain parities would much prefer if he let the matter rest. I can't tell you more; but the author really makes the most of this premise. Many figures from Russian history are brought to startling life.<br /><br />Harris powers of description are really superb, and his images of Russia, especially rural, northern Russia, were so bleak and otherworldly I felt shivers. What I really love about Harris is not only are his story ideas enthralling and richly promising, his abilities as a writer back up the promise. How many books have you started because the story idea sounded great, only to find the author wasn't a good writer? Well, have no fear with Harris. His plotting and pace really make you feel like you are racing to the end, his characters are people you care about and oddly lasting in memory, and his historical research is really top notch.<br /><br />I guarantee you will be thinking about the words of Zanaida Pupava, the legal student paying her way through law school by turning tricks in a \\"new Russia,\\" long after you finish the book. -Mykal Banta	2005-05-09

I have never been in the military and appreciated this aspect of the book. It gave me a real glimpse of the highly structured, vast world of the military, which the author presents as a kind of culture and universe all to itself. The novel was very good on that score.<br /><br />But I found it a bit lacking in the action department. I can't agree with reviewers that refer to this one as \\"action-packed.\\" I recently finished \\"Fortunes of War\\" by Stephen Coontz. Now that one is action-packed. The soldiers in this book do a great deal of marching, and there is a great deal of excellent observations about leadership and soldiering, but action?<br /><br />Still, Mr. Coyle's descriptions of the enormous challenges a mega-organization like the U.S. Military face and deal with year in and year out are worth the price of admission. -Mykal Banta	2005-03-13

With some other techno thrillers, I have had the feeling that there was a little too much techno and not enough thriller (and I am a techno fan and love air fighters and warships and submarines). I have even put a few of the big-time techno writers aside when the prose seemed more a blur of military acronyms and abbreviations than a story involving plot and characters. Well, I had no problem racing to the finish of this book. Don't get me wrong - there is plenty of techno detail in this book, but it fits right into the flow of the book. It is also explained well and quickly.<br /><br />Make no mistake: this one's a thriller. As I neared the end, I found myself so focused in I lost track of time and seemed to come up blinking back into the real world once I had finished. To sum up quickly, Japan has declared war on Russia in an effort to control the vast oil field of Siberia and the world nears the brink of nuclear war. What makes this novel work so well, other than a strongly plotted story served up by an excellent writer, is the way the author develops and handles the characters. I found myself turning pages not to discover the fate of \\"the world\\" but instead the fate of the individuals Stephen Coonts brought to such vivid life.<br /><br />My favorite characters were the Russians: men like Captain Pavel Saratov, the commander of a Russian submarine with an Ahab like devotion to duty and mission; Marshall Oleg Stolypin, a classic, Russian man of steel, returning to soldiering one last time; and (perhaps the most interesting of all) Russian Intelligence officer Janos Ilin, cynical and crafty, alone with his brilliance and planning.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and will read more from this author. -Mykal Banta	2005-03-07

Thank heavens he refuses to let go. Arcady Renko is the most fascinating reoccurring character in fiction today, maybe ever.<br /><br />What makes Renko so interesting is the way he has negotiated the shark and pirate-invested waters of the Soviet Union/Russia for over 25 years, and the magic of the series is the taciturn yet graceful manner in which Renko always keeps his head just above water. Many seemingly tougher and smarter men and women have vanished beneath the icy, gray waves of Russian politics and crime over the years, but he is still here bobbing around, searching for the hard truth no one wants to see.<br /><br />In this novel the hard truth lies in the radioactive pit created in the Ukraine around Chernobyl - the \\"Zone.\\" I won't go into the details, which you can read for yourself. Suffice to say that the \\"New Russia\\" is perhaps more shark-invested than the old Soviet Union, as the economic free-for-all of capitalism unleashes wolves and dogs alike which had once been kept on the iron leash of communism.<br /><br />Renko is still alive, still turning over the smooth stones to reveal the dark, chaotic life underneath.

Politically, I agree with the author's observations about the current abuses and manipulations of our legal system, but for Heaven's sake, come at it with some finesse next time. Also, to really send the novel into the silly, the author needs to shore up some of his research. Case in point, a Glock pistol is not \\"mostly plastic\\" and will most definitely not make it through a metal detector save the barrel. In fact, the entire slide/receiver is metal, which accounts for close to a pound of the gun's weight, and will go off like a fire alarm (with or without the barrel)in any metal detector in the world.

In an age as temporal as ours, when ideas and fashions seem to come and go as fast as the dot.com craze, his writing will be around as long as intelligent people gain pleasure from reading.<br /><br />The author's vision of the three stages of the afterlife is so beautifully realized; I actually felt waves of primal fear during several of the Inferno Cantos. In these medieval pages, the tortures of the damned seemed viscerally real, and soul chilling in their horror. As I read, I could almost feel myself becoming lighter as Dante and Virgil made their way up.<br /><br />For my money, Ciardi's translation is the best. His style is both poetic and dramatic, and while he strives to make the text accessible to a modern reader, he does not make the mistake of cheapening the genius of Dante by making a \\"modern\\" translation. Ciardi lets the full weight of the medieval mind come through in the language and the result is vivid and extremely visual.<br /><br />I really benefited from Ciardi's notes as well, which begin each Canto with a brief synopsis of what is happening, and then after each Canto a more detailed explanation of the various levels, themes, and points of interest. And, of course, all the various characters and personalities that Dante encounters in his journey toward and into Heaven are explained (if the reader does not have an extremely solid grasp of Medieval European politics (and how many of us do?), his notes are invaluable.<br /><br />Of course you should read this book, and I highly recommend this translation.	2004-11-19

It was not what I was after. The book is for the reader that has a good grounding in Stalin's life and accomplishments (and Russian history) and is looking for the more day-to-day intimate or trivial details of the man's life. Below is an example of a typical page:<br /><br />\\"Nadya played tennis with the immaculate Voroshilov, when he was sober, and Kaganovich, who played in his tunic and boots. Mikoyan, Voroshilov and Budyonny rode horses donated by the Cavalry Inspectorate. If it was winter, Kaganovish and Mikoyan skied. Molotov pulled his daughter in a sledge like a nag pulling a peasant's plough. Vjoroshilov and Sergo were avid hunters. Stalin preferred billiards.\\"<br /><br />This is not what I was looking for or even care about. Events in Russian history, like the Great Terror, leap into the text without warning as a kind of background to much more intimate details. I was looking for an explanation of these events within some historical context, not what deserts Stalin preferred after dinner while they were going on.<br /><br />In addition, I thought the prose lacked any sense of drama, and the time frame jumped around so often it was difficult for me, being a novice of Russian history, to have any sense of place.<br /><br />This book would have value if the reader had a firm footing in Russian history and a previous knowledge of Stalin's life. Then the intimate revelations of this work would flesh out the image of the subject.	2004-10-27

The author, Thomas Asbridge, has written a taut, clear account of a time in history that, at least for me, has always seemed terribly murky and shrouded in fable.<br /><br />The main strength of the book is its strong, direct, linear flow. The reader follows the First Crusade from its birth in Clermont and Pope Urban's preaching tour across France; to the Crusade's bloody finale and the Christian army's rampage through Jerusalem.  Asbridge is, plain and simply, a good writer, and his vivid language bring the time and place to remarkable light. He has a good writer's eye for drama and the telling detail, and he brings in amazing writings from Crusade participants to flesh out the telling. Characters and events really came to life in my mind's eye while reading, whole landscapes and battles, so that I found myself setting the books aside more than once, simply to let the movie play for a moment. All in all, a great reading experience.<br /><br />As the book progressed, I really came to visualize the Crusading armies marching from Western Europe across the known world, slowly transforming itself through the crucible of starvation, decease, horrific battles, and hardship. They had begun as an unorganized, splintered assortment of rabble and soldier, princes and false prophets, numbering perhaps 100,000 souls, barely able to mount a cohesive attack. By the time they had reached Lebanon, the army had hardened down to a pack of fast moving, ruthless veterans, sending terror through the Muslim world. Muslim cities, hearing of their barbarity, began begging for peace, throwing riches at them, usually to no avail.<br /><br />Finally, this efficient juggernaut simply stormed against the heavily fortified Holy City of Jerusalem, taking it quickly and horribly despite overwhelming odds against them, then tore through the city like starved wolves, killing everything (including children and women). The image of the victorious crusaders, coming to fall in tearful prayer at the Holy Sepulchre, their faces and clothes still drenched in blood, is one of the most perfect in the book - at once capturing the strange amalgamation of genuine religious fervor and blood-curdling terror that marked the times. The author also poses many new ideas about the Crusades as well (such as his view of the effect of the religious relic, the Holy Lance, which the author feels had much less importance than is traditionally thought), which make this book good for both history novice and expert alike.<br /><br />The author does a good job of viewing the times in a fair light. The magnificent achievement of the crusading armies is not understated. After reading what the soldiers and knights of this crusade went through, it is easier to understand why they truly considered many of their victories \\"miracles\\" and sure evidence of God's hand. The author does not overlook the grimmer realities of the First Crusade either, which can be summed up in this simple sentence near the end of the book: \\"In bitter revelation, these eastern Christians soon discovered that they had in fact been better off under Muslim rule than they were in a 'liberated' Jerusalem.\\"<br /><br />You will be glad you read this book.tearful prayer at the Holy Sepulchre, their faces and clothes still drenched in blood, is one of the most perfect in the book - at once capturing the strange amalgamation of genuine religious fervor and blood-curdling terror that marked the times.

Her hull had been devastated by shipworm and abuse, the sails in tatters. The sailors aboard, staring with death eyes from the deck railing, were dressed in filthy rags, ravaged by scurvy and exhaustion, some of them barely able to stand.<br /><br />The ship, and the 21 survivors, had sailed around the world, completing the first, complete circumnavigation of the planet.<br /><br />What happened in the three years between is the subject of this fascinating book. The author has written a very readable, page turning account of the voyage. Megellan emerges as a fascinating character, and the author presents the man as an incredibly brave, inflexible leader that commanded through simple power and intimidation. His accomplishments, such as his navigation of the straits in South America, are given their full due, as is his incredible toughness in the face of unbelievable obstacles. His mistakes are not overlooked, either, or his aggressive, warlike nature, which eventually cost him everything.<br /><br />It is impossible to imagine what these men braved in their quest. In 1519, it was still believed that the oceans south of the equator boiled, that there were magnetic islands in the uncharted waters that would pull the nails from the hulls of ships, and that monsters waited to eat ships whole that sailed \\"over the edge of the world.\\" Megellan himself believed that the presence of St. Elmo's fire in the ships rigging were actually saints blessing his voyage.<br /><br />The amazing thing about this book, and their story, is the real dangers they faced were even more horrifying than the mythical legends they feared.<br /><br />This is a very readable, yet never lightweight, telling of the greatest sea voyage of all time. I highly recommend it.<br />The amazing thing about this book, and their story, is the real dangers they faced were even more horrifying than the mythical legends they feared.   <br /> <br />This is a very readable, yet never lightweight, telling of the greatest sea voyage of all time.

The ship ran aground off the coast of Australia while sailing for the Indies; casting the survivors upon a rough, desolate collection of tiny islands, which were little more than rocky outcroppings. As if this weren't bad enough, among the survivors was a fellow named Jeromimus Corneliszoon. Sad for the men, women and children who had survived the wreck, the isolation and hardship of the situation brought Corneliszoon's psychopathy to full flower. The heart of the book chronicles his erratic, blood-drenched reign over the band of castaways.<br /><br />The strength of this book lies primarily in the author's description of the fascinating spice trade of the 16th century. The vast fortunes and incredible dangers and hardships of this world provide a vivid back ground for the events of the book, and the author does a great job of bringing them to life. The Dutch, who presently have a rather benign and pleasant international image, were the masters of this adamantine world, and they ruled with a machine-like ruthlessness. I was not fully aware what was involved for an individual to be \\"broken on the wheel\\" or even \\"keel-hauled.\\" The sailors who, for their own desperate reasons, risked themselves in the 16th century merchant profession knew what it meant, and knew the masters of the Dutch East India Company would dispense these and other punishments without qualm or conscience.<br /><br />It was a brutal business requiring brutal men, and the author takes care and skill in describing the characters of the spice trade. Men like the incredible, iron-souled Jan Coen, Governor-General of Batavia (the Island in the Indies, not the Ship) seem to leap at you off the page in icy aggressiveness.<br /><br />The only weakness I found in the book was, oddly, the author's description of the central events. Mr. Dash as taken a factual, cool retelling of the horrible slaughter of the castaways. Perhaps the author didn't want to be accused of \\"novelizing\\" the events, but I found the telling a bit chilly and unsatisfying. Perhaps, too, I had hoped for too much. The situation was one so rife with dramatic potential; I had anticipated scenes from Shakespeare. The writer of history, however, must stick to primary sources and journal accounts, after all, and must be very wary of dramatically enhancing events.<br /><br />The strengths far outshine the slight weaknesses, though, and the book really kept me turning pages. I recommend it. - Mykal Bantaps the author didn't want to be accused of \\"novelizing\\" the events, but I found the telling a bit chilly and unsatisfying. Perhaps, too, I had hoped for too much.

At the heart of the conflict were two major combatants, England and Holland. At stake was the richest trade in the world, the exotic spices that came from the tiny, primal islands below China and India - the \\"spiceries\\" as they were called.<br /><br />This tiny collection of exotic islands, inhabited by stone-age cultures and lush forests, became the grand prize of the day, offering nearly unbelievable riches and a horrifying catalogue of dangers. Nearly all the grand exploration of the time had as its primary goal the discovery of faster routes to these islands, and countries seemed in a nearly constant state of war over them.<br /><br />The author does a good job of describing this long-ago world. He also is good at describing the kind of near hysteria that gripped kings and queens of the day. Literally, the control of these islands, and the trade routes, could bring a country to global dominance. Countries and men leapt at the chance to go there, despite the fact that life expectancy for European's established in these outposts was short (most died very quickly of dysentery or malaria), and the chances of surviving the ocean voyage in the first place was not good.<br /><br />Eventually, Holland won the contest. Brutal ruthlessness was the key to success. While no country proved deficient in these qualities, Holland, through the Dutch East Indian Spice Company,  relentlessly and without a trace of mercy showed the severest hand. They were no slouches in the slave trade, either.<br /><br />A very engaging account - brief but very well researched. I recommend it.	2004-10-15
US	51092072	R18OTY0SMY38N2	0765301903	110357950	Port Hazard (Page Murdock, US Deputy Marshall, Book 7)	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	Another winner in a great series!	After reading this book and loving it, as I do all the Estleman westerns, I decided to write a review and was surprised to see that mine would be the first review. If this indicates a lack of readership, that is a true shame because Loren D. Estleman is one of the finest writers working in fiction today.<br />This book is another entry in the western series starring Page Murdock, Deputy U.S. Marshall from the Montana Territory. In this installment, Murdock is sent to the Barbary Coast of San Francisco not many years after the end of the Civil War. His mission is to disrupt the activities of The Sons of the Confederacy, a dangerous fringe group that threatens the peaceful re-union of the states.<br />The Page Murdoch series works on a couple of different levels; the first being that of a well told, beautifully paced action novel. On another level, Estleman's westerns work as impeccably researched historical novels, a level in which this novel is particularly strong. Estleman brings the incredibly dangerous bustle of the Coast to life in these pages. From the criminal rhyming slang and gang warfare to the oily seduction of the opium dens, this is a place that nearly glitters with danger.  When Murdock walks its streets, Estleman's expert prose makes the hair on the back of the reader's neck stand on end. Estleman's work is always sprinkled with historical detail, whether it be Murdock's beloved 5 shot Deane-Adams English revolver or the style of dress and manners.<br />And, of course, Estleman's westerns also work as mainstream literature. There is an unsentimental quality about his writing that is very refreshing, as well as elements of a very dry humor. The plotting is done with a master's touch, and every Page Murdoch adventure is backed by a brilliant storyline. In addition, nearly every page is sparked with a clever and concise turn of phrase that brings things in a fresh way to the reader's mind (much like Shakespeare).<br />Finally, the characters always jump right off the page and mark a place in the reader's memory. This novel is no exception. My favorite characters in this novel were Hodge, a dwarf bouncer that has a ball and chain were his hand used to be, who has to use a ladder to hop up on the bar, where he enforces decorum; and F'an Chu'an (Fat John) the powerful, menacing head man of the Chinese Tong gang.<br />To sum up, I truly hope I am not the last reader that will review this work. Estleman deserves to be widely read. --Mykal Bantamp right off the page and mark a place in the reader's memory. This novel is no exception.

Julian Hatcher wrote this book in 1947, and it touches on virtually every aspect of firearms then current. The author's writing style is precise and clear without being dry. The operation of all military small arms and machine guns are given in great detail, as well as Hatcher's observations about recoil, gun powder, metallurgy, ballistics, and much more. I don't think I have ever learned more about firearms from any other single volume. It is an incredible history lesson for the firearms enthusiast written by a man that watched it all happen first hand. Read this book to truly appreciate the incredible engineering feat that the machine gun represents.<br />Still, the value of the work goes beyond a catalogue of all aspects of military firearms - it is a man discussing the great passion of his life. Imagine an enthusiastic teacher, who truly loves his subject, telling you in detail everything he knows.<br />If you are as fascinated with firearms as I am, get this book. You will not be disappointed.<br />--Mykal Banta	2004-05-10

I don't know about you, but I am sick of overly sarcastic or &quot;humorous&quot; approaches to series topics - the whole &quot;atomic fusion for dummies&quot; style of writing. I find a clear, insightful explanation entertaining enough, thanks. When I read this book, I found it thrilling because all the basic economic principles we all live with everyday (but so often are clouded in mystery) suddenly opened up before me because of the author's clarity.<br />It is true that Mr. Heilbroner is a liberal\democratic leaning economist. He admits that up front, however, in the introduction, and he promises the reader that all points of view in the book will be clearly marked as opinion and never given as fact. I should say that I lean to the right heavily, and I did not find this book unfair or overly biased at all. If you are a conservative like me, do not omit this book because of the author's stated economic preferences. It is a wonderful book full of deep insights and observations, written for serious grown-ups looking for an introduction into the fascinating world of economics. --Mykal Banta	2004-04-21

The first similarity is that the writing is extremely lucid, explaining many complex ideas in a direct way, which only superior writing can achieve. And like Durant, Heilbroner has a contagious enthusiasm for his subject matter. He really makes the economists come alive, both because of their personalities and their thinking.  Finally, like Durant's work, this book has really made me eager to read the works of the men that the author summarizes.<br />When I became interested in economics, this book was recommended to me as the first one I should read.

If there is a reader out there interested in trying Leonard for the first time, this is as good a place to start as any (from a numerous selection of good titles). Split Images is a great crime novel, and Elmore Leonard is so subtle in the way he writes, that I find myself reading along with what seems like a classic sort of hard boiled mystery only to realize slowly that I am reading something more than that. There have been a ton of hard school writers after him that adopted his nearly comic overtone, but none are as good. What would make this a good first entry into the world of Leonard is that this novel contains many elements that make it \\"Classic Leonard.\\"<br />First, it is set in Detroit. Mr. Leonard has moved around a lot in his writing, setting his novels in several areas, but Detroit will always remain his most fertile ground for a setting. I come from the Detroit area and suffice to say, Leonard nails it dead center in every respect. This is Detroit in all its aging industry and working-class struggle. His ability to describe the look and feel of Detroit is second to none, with the possible exception of Loren Estleman.<br />Secondly, his characterization is terrific. In this novel, which is about a cop's pursuit of an unlikely team of thrill killers (one is a rich sociopath and the other is a ex-cop with a violent history), Leonard was at the top of his game.<br />When describing Leonard's strengths, one word always comes up: dialogue. No one writes better dialogue. No one. Ever. You can nearly hear the character's voice as you read.  He is so good at writing dialogue that the reader can nearly see the character speaking whether Leonard gives a physical description or not.<br />Lastly, I can think of no other author that handles the male-female relationship with more grace and style than Leonard. The romance in this book is woven perfectly into the narrative thread so that the lover of action fiction (like me) doesn't find themselves hurrying through the mushy parts. Compare this to the Spenser books by Robert Parker, Where Spenser has a girlfriend names Susan. Lord have mercy on the poor reader when Spenser (Parker) starts yapping about or to Susan. All movement in the books stops stone cold dead while we, the reader, is so obviously meant to be impressed with the couples mature, adult relationship.<br />All in all, Leonard is the best crime writer of the past thirty years -  maybe forever.the mushy parts.

US	51092072	RCQ8E8MH914XR	0060512245	352393955	Killshot	Books	4	29	32	N	N	Story of an aging hit man - Leonard style	The theme of this book is one that Elmore Leonard uses often, and nearly always to great effect - a romantic couple is swept innocently into the world of crime and has to discover heretofore-unknown resources to save themselves.<br />The reason this works so well for Leonard is that it lets him write to two of his great strengths. First, of course, is the world of criminals and cops. His criminals are always incredibly well drawn and always very distinct and three-dimensional. I have never read it anywhere, but I would guess that Quentin Tarantino must have been a big Leonard fan in his developmental years. His screen killers bear the hallmarks of Leonard characters; i.e. impassioned conversations about everyday things (like the two hit men in Pulp Fiction discussing McDonald's Big Macs) while dwelling in the sub-culture of crime and violence.<br />The second and less-commented-on strength Leonard has is the ability to portray the tugs and pulls of a male/female relationship with such effortless accuracy.  In the interplay of the novel's husband and wife team, the subtle, aggravating, thrilling differences between man and woman are expertly rendered with a few classic, Leonard strokes. Also, Leonard is also the master at local color and authentic detail. His research and detail always has the feel of easy, unforced truth.<br />But let's face it; crime is what makes Leonard tick - the deal, the scam - and the men and women licking their chops over money and guns. It is certainly all here in this book.  Here, it's an extortion scheme combining the efforts of an aging, nearly burned out hit man (Armand Degas) and a clever, hyperactive sociopath (Richie Nix).  As always, Leonard develops his characters with subtle, concise power. Nix slowly becomes a truly frightening, dangerous character,<br />My favorite element of the book is Leonard's portrait of the half Ojibwa, half Canadian hit man, Armand Degas. In a way, the book is his somehow his story. From the beginning, he seems vaguely aware that his end is coming. Leonard's portrayal of this tiring man of violence lends certain poignancy to this character that stays with the reader.<br />All in all, classic Leonard - meaning a work that will keep you turning pages in effortless joy., he seems vaguely aware that his end is coming.

Another great Western by Loren Estleman. For my money, Estleman is the best Western writer in the world. His reoccurring character, U.S. Marshall, Page Murdock, is always a sure winner. The writing is very good, as is the characterization. In this book, Eslteman brings to life a classic old west gunslinger named Chris Shedwell. As is always the case with Estleman, his description of Shedwell's life is as authentic and sharp as a spur. Shedwell is a haunted man, his condition nearly terminal because of the reputation that follows him like the finger of death. Estleman's knowledge of firearms of the late 19th Century is second to none as well. There are never any exaggerated fireworks in any of his work. The great thing about Estelman's Western books is they are both myth destroying and myth making at the same time. An example of this is the way Estleman handles the character, Shedwell. You will never find the hero, Murdock, squaring off with Shedwell in a traditional middle of the street quick draw contest, which rarely if ever happened in the old west. Men then, like now, usually killed each other at very close quarters in furious bursts of violence.<br />What makes Estleman's work jump off the page, though, is the dialogue. Rather than trying to describe it, let me give you a taste. When asked if he is afraid of the gunfighter (Shedwell), Murdock responds:<br />&quot;Not afraid. I know he'll kill me. He's dropped nine men that I know of, most of them looking at him. He's better than I am. Besides, whether you've noticed it or not, I'm not the most popular figure in this town after last night. I've heard of three men holding off a roomful of angry citizens, but the reason I've heard of it is it doesn't happen very often. The next time I see Shedwell, I want him alone with his back to me and a shotgun in my hands.&quot;<br />Do yourself a favor and get this book, as well as all the Estleman Western titles.	2004-02-02

This is a great WWI memoir, and it gives some incredible insights the makings of a great soldier. As one might expect, Mr. McBride was an extremely tough, brave man. However, this book makes it clear that there are some other, less obvious qualities to the professional soldier. Contrary to popular believe, imagination and individual initiative are among them. Most importantly, though, is a particular mindset. I leave it to McBride to put it best:<br />&quot;Hatred is a slow, calculating, cold-blooded business. There is no time for it in battle . . . I assure you that when I was behind the rifle, the principal feeling was one of keen satisfaction and excitement of the same kind that the hunter knows. That's the spirit. That's what makes good rifleman and good soldiers.&quot;<br />If you are looking for poetic prose, look elsewhere. McBride was not an introspective man, full of soulful wanderings about the horrors of war. This soldier was thrilled and eager to participate in war, and joined the Canadian force because his home country, America, was too slow to enter the fray for his tastes. He described the mud of the trenches and the sound a bullet makes striking a human head in hatchet-like, blunt sentences.<br />There is the satisfaction, though, that this lover of war told you the hard truth in every word he wrote. Another reviewer called this book &quot;refreshing&quot; and I will second that.<br />In one segment of the book, McBride describes his distaste for a current war movie of the time of the book's writing, the classic &quot;All Quite On The Western Front.&quot; While McBride complemented the scenes of actual battle, the whole show was ruined for him by the depiction of men in battle. The constant emotions, and, as he wrote of them, &quot;facial contortions&quot; exhibited by the actors where in his view ridiculous. Men died quickly, fought hard, and killed one another without a lot of fuss, or &quot;sob stuff,&quot; as he called it.<br />I believe H.W. McBride is telling me the truth.. McBride is telling me the truth.	2004-01-02

It seems that Mr. Hunter is improving with age and his prose gets better and better. My two favorite Swagger titles so far have been this book and Hunter's last one, Hot Springs.<br />What makes this book good is, of course, Mr. Hunter's powers of description of scenes involving gunplay . The reader can really feel the percussive blast of gunfire and hear bullets pang off metal. What sets this author apart is that he combines great authenticity regarding firearms without going into geek detail about weaponry. I can't think of a current mainstream author that can come close to Hunter for firearm knowledge, but the general reader need not beware. There will be no blur of calibers, model numbers, or military abbreviations in his work, or just enough to make things real.<br />Also, the characters in this novel are well drawn and very interesting. Speshnev, the Russian agent in Cuba is a particularly good creation. He is a thin, grey haired man who can realistically pose as a vacuum cleaner salesman (which he does)until there is some hard, dirty work to do, whereas he transforms into a very effective professional. There is something almost flippant and poetic in his nature that makes him even more disarming.<br />For those of you who have read Hot Springs, the character Frenchy Short returns as a CIA agent, as smart and hungry as ever, loyal only to his own overwhelming hunger for power.<br />Finally, I found the scenes involving Bob Lee Swagger and his Father, Earl Swagger very touching. Hunter does a good job in describing a son's overpowering need to get love from a father and all the small things that shape a boy into a man.	2003-12-01

Books	2	28	53	N	N	The problem with Moore	This book irritates me terribly, as does it's author, and I have been trying to think of the real reason why. True, I am a conservative, and I find his book stuffed with extremely tired liberal concepts. For instance, Moore seems so indignant and righteous over the fact that rich corporations have more control in our lives than, say, the guy bagging groceries at Publix. Well, Duh. Thanks for the revelations, Mike, but I sort of already knew. In fact, I sort of realized some time ago that that is the way, in one form or another, the world has worked sense homo sapiens stood upright on two legs. Rich people rule the earth, even when shrouded in the veil of democracy. Moore's constant rant that American's have been lied to always makes me laugh. Of course, I, being a stooge, need Michael Moore to tell me the \\"truth.\\" Moore knows no truth, he simply sees what I see and draws different conclusions. He simply thinks he is so much smarter than me, or any of us conservatives, that he feels entitled to interpret things for us. Hey, Michael, news flash. I like the world the way it is. I do nicely in it just the way it is set up. Thanks anyway.<br />No, it isn't so much his opinions. I really believe the world needs liberals. Someone has to be idealistic and starry-eyed to sort of remind us how things might be if human beings weren't so, well, human. Besides, without sounding corny, I think people like Moore prove what an incredibly great country this is. Folks like Pat Buchanan prove the same thing. Opposing viewpoints, to a very great extent, are welcome. Hell, in this great country a guy can even get rich simply voicing his opinion. It's the American way.<br />What I have no respect for in Moore is that he is made gleeful when America, in his opinion, fails. He is like the unpopular kid in high school that is made giggly when a car load of popular students is killed in a car crash. I never get the feeling for a second that he was in any way saddened about  9/11. It was one more event that Moore can twist to incriminate the country he claims to love so much. One more opportunity to view things so clearly in 20-20 hindsight.<br />In short, there seems to be absolutely no humanity in Moore's liberalism. Instead, there seems to be only a very bitter need to get even with life's popular and powerful children. He doesn't really give a damn about the little man, he just wants to throw stones at the big boys.<br />When the popular kids were killed in the car crash, Moore would spread gossip that they were driving drunk. See? It was really their own fault.e more event that Moore can twist to incriminate the country he claims to love so much.

My thinking being that a writer this popular must not dwell in the rarified air of the true &quot;artist.&quot; Good God Almighty, how ignorant the young can be.<br />These are great stories, crafted with a sure, firm hand. After reading several of the stories, and enjoying every one, it became clear what made L'amour so enduring a writer. First, the stories are constructed like brick houses. Even the very short ones have within them a clean, pure structure. They always start off at full speed, moving very quickly through conflict and resolution. Also, they are very intriguing stories, meaning that I was curious and eager, in every single one, to discover what happens. Finally, L'amour wrote about real people. Set against the current trend in American literature to create outlandish characters, chalk full of oddball ticks and habits, L'amour's characters seemed somehow all that more memorable.<br />I don't know about you, but I have lost track of the number of books I have started recently, and after about 100 pages have to admit that 1) I really don't care about any of the characters. 2) I really don't care what happens next, and<br />3) the author is an oversensitive child, full of tricks and drama but nothing really to say.<br />Sound familiar? If it does, give this book a try. It's the antidote. These were stories written by a grown man that had lived a real life, and he had something to say. Luckily for us, he was also a great writer with a gift for storytelling.	2003-11-20

It is just a pleasure to hold and read this book. In an age where hardcover bindings are glued in and crack after one reading and the average book is rushed to press before the typos are weeded out, this book reminds us that a book itself can be an object of art.<br />This book contains the writings of Jim Corbett, a civil servant in British India who happened to be a crack shot and game tracker. Mr. Corbett was hired by the Government on several occasions to dispose of man eating leopards and tigers. What makes Jim Corbett's writings so noteworthy is their direct honesty and utter sense of humanity. Let me say upfront that I love tales of big game hunting, and I bought this book because, among big-game hunting literature, Jim Corbett's books are considered classics, along with the writings of more traditional hunters like Walter Bell and Frederick Courteney Selous. Among these big game hunting classics, Corbett's writings are unique in that, unlike most big game hunters, Corbett didn't seem to derive any &quot;thrill of the hunt.&quot; He was doing a job he was very good at to save innocent lives, pure and simple. He had love and sympathy for the animals he was killing, and he became committed to killing them reluctantly.  This feeling of respect for the animal and reluctance in its destruction is most evident in The Man-Eating Leopard of Rudraprayag.<br />Once committed, however, Corbett seemed to take personal responsibility for every individual the man-eating leopard killed, and his sense of depression and guilt over each fresh kill done on his watch is palpable in these pages. This particular leopard stalked travelers and towns along the pilgrim's road that led to the shrines in Kedernath and Badrinath, often selecting children or the aged. Reading Corbett's plain, effective prose, the deadly situation takes on a religious significance. Corbett is defeated several times, each failure resulting in more pilgrims killed, and the pilgrims and people in the towns came to believe that the leopard was an evil spirit that had taken on material form.<br />Let me wrap up by saying that Corbett was a man to be admired for his basic, down-to-earth humanity and his complete lack of self-congratulation. He was simply a man of high character and wrote plainly about being exhausted, disgusted with his failings, and just flat scared. He was also a very humble man and always seemed embarrassed by the extreme expressions of gratitude given him upon his ultimate success in bagging the man-eater.<br />The final scene, where villagers come to the bazaar where the leopard is on display, is extremely moving. The people came in droves and one-by-one showered Corbett's feet with flowers while reciting tales of their children or loved ones that had been killed by the man-eater.  Suffice to say this is one of the most simple and beautifully rendered scenes I have read in any book.<br />Of all the big game hunting books I have read, Corbett's writings hold a special place for me. His skill as a hunter saved hundreds of lives, ending the suffering of more hundreds, perhaps thousands. Yet he never thought himself a hero.<br />Perhaps that was the very quality that made him heroic.adrinath, often selecting children or the aged.

I read it because I had read several of the Sharpe's books by Bernard Cornwell, and have become interested in the first Duke of Wellington, who is a reoccurring officer in several of the Sharpe's novels. I liked the fictional creation and wanted to see how accurate was the fictional portrait to the real man. I was gratified to learn that I liked the real life Duke as much as Cornwell's portrayal of him.<br />The author of this non-fiction work, Andrew Roberts, is a young historian who is excellent at researching his topic, and he is also a solid writer. While I would recommend this book to anyone, I would suggest a serious interest in the subject matter. This certainly isn't beach reading or an adventure novel, full of battle and sword.<br />Andrew Davis' main thrust his this:  the commonly  accepted historical view of these two men, Napoleon and Wellington, and the battle of Waterloo, is that Napoleon seriously underestimated Wellington's ability as a general was therefore caught by surprise by Wellington's fine generalship on the day of battle. Further, that Napoleon had no respect at all for Wellington, referring to him as &quot;that sepoy General&quot; (a reference to Wellington's service in India, where he won several impressive victories but had not defeated European armies). Davis does not agree with this assessment, claiming that before the battle, Napoleon had praised Wellington, and it was only after the battle, and during his long, bitter exile at St. Helena, that Napoleon became increasingly critical and insulting in his comments about Wellington. The Author spends the book reviewing the writings and actions of both men, in support of his premise.<br />Yet, after reading the book, I was not convinced. While the author makes it clear that as years passed Napoleon exhibited an almost demented obsession with regard to the battle of Waterloo, subsequently blaming nearly everyone present for the lose other than himself, and also in tearing down and belittling Wellington, he wasn't exactly full of praise and respect for Wellington before the battle either.<br />Andrew Roberts gives several examples of Napoleon's written and spoken statements about Wellington before the battle, and none of them are very substantial or enthusiastic. All of them sound like comments one general would say about another in an effort not to openly insult the other, instead of actual giving praise or respect. Take for example Davis' noting that Napoleon admitting in 1814 that Wellington had made a &quot;reputation&quot; for himself in the Peninsula. Could this not be seen, in the light of other comments from Napoleon regarding Wellington's opposition in the Penisula, to have been a sarcastic comment, or even an insult? The author also cites Napoleon referring to Wellington as &quot;a man of viguor in Warfare.&quot;  Not exactly a ringing endorsement, is it? Davis supplies other evidence, all of such lukewarm substance. All of Napoleon's comments on Wellington merely seem polite or measured in the same way. None of it ever smacks of real respect or supplies any indication that Napoleon was seriously impressed with Wellington. Napoleon seems to have considered Wellington a good, solid General, but certainly not in His class - perhaps the best the British had to offer.<br />The author bends over backward in this book to give a balanced view of both men, striving to make the point that both men were more alike that dissimilar. Again, Davis' own work does not leave me with that impression. If anything, Davis' own writings leave me with the impression that the two men were about as different as two men can be. Napoleon: a brash, classless man, so resentful and hateful of Wellington for defeating him that his soul turned small, dry and bitter, until his own obsessions and resentment ate him alive. An inspired man, and inspiring. A creature for theimagination. Wellington: a winning machine. A man possessing a razor mind and cold eyes that never, ever saw failure in anything. A creature of will and intellect, perfect for Empire. A gentleman in war and victory. In the end, Wellington was simply the better general and the better man.the imagination.

In this novel, the English army must somehow take Gawalghur, a seemingly impenetrable mountaintop fortress and last bastion of the Mahratta army.<br />This is an excellent historical/military novel in that the siege of Gawalghur is explained in dramatic terms; the tactics, the officers, the siege itself, are all here. As always, Cornwell is unmatched in his talent for bringing military affairs to life. I felt as if I was right there with the engineers and soldiers, sweating in the noonday sun. And, of course, the bloodletting is always well described in a cornwell book.<br />During the intense military maneuverings, Sharpe has uncovered a crooked officer, who is misappropriating military supplies and sealing them on the black market. Sharpe is nearly killed for his discover, and then seeks revenge Richard Sharpe style.<br />Just a great book with great characters. Cornwell is particularly adept at writing a great villain. Sharpe's nemesis, the horrid Sergeant Obadiah Hakeswill is here, of course, but my favorite bad guy was the crooked officer Captain Torrence. This guy puts the \\"C\\" in Creepy. In a beautiful bit of character development, Cornwell has Torrence nearly always receiving his staff in the nude. He explains this nudeness by claiming that with India being so hot and all, he just finds it more comfortable. Not so bad in and of itself, but what makes him creepy is the pleasure he takes at everyone's discomfort when in his presence.<br />Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington, is here as well, perfectly described in his ever developing relationship to Richard Sharpe.<br />Buy it. You can't go wrong with a Sharpe book.	2003-09-19

Chronologically, this is the first adventure of the war-loving soldier, Richard Sharpe. I am new to the series, but if the first three books are any indication (The India Trilogy), I will read them all.<br />The author, Cornwell, is a perfect blend of great storyteller and excellent writer. Cornwell's discription of the siege of Seringapatum is beautifully rendered. The reader can feel the heat and exaustion, hear the swish of saber and whine of bullets. Often, in books that deal with military history, the reader may find himself slightly confused as to troops movements and tactics, but not here. Cornell is such a fantastic action writer, that it is all crystal clear. The reader can sense the flow of action, picture the battlefield perfectly, and understand the reasons behind the decisions; and all without hampering the surge of action.<br />The characters in the novel are particularily well drawn. This is a story with great villians and enemies. Especially enjoyable is Sharpe's nemisis in the novel, the horrid Obadiah Hakewill, Sharpe's sadistic sargent. I also like the author's portrait of The Tippoo Sultan. while it would be hard to call it a sympathetic portrait, Cornwell takes pains to write this enemy in truthful, fascinating strokes.<br />Just a great piece of work and one of the few books I have read lately that have kept me up all night reading. Onward, Mister Sharpe!	2003-09-08

On the strength of Sharpe's Triumph, I will read all the Sharpe's books in chronological order. I have already begun Sharpe's Tiger, and it is a captivating as Triumph.<br />Like all the Sharpe books, this one follows the adventures of infantryman, Richard Sharpe, a lowly born Englishman serving and making his way in Her Majesty's Army around the turn of the 19th Century. This puts him in the midst of the great Napoleonic Era of war making. A fascinating time for Military buffs. This particular novel is set in India and revolves around the battle of Assaye.<br />The strengths of this books are these:<br />First, this is an excellent historical novel. The firearms used, the methods of combat, the Indian political settings, and the settings are very accurate and transporting.  But please don't get the idea the book is a dry history lesson. Cornwall wraps the history within a great, old fashioned tale of revenge and blood.<br />Secondly, the characters in this book, both real and imagined, are carefully drawn and utterly convincing. My favorite was the author's portrayal of General Arthur Wellesley (before he became the Duke of Wellington).  The reader really gets a good sense of what made Wellesley such a great commander of men.  The great General and future Duke is completely brought to life.<br />Finally, the battle writing is superb. Cornwall supplies you with a map of the battleground, and his writing is so clear and concise that you can actually see in your mind's eye the movement of men and the progress of the battle. It all makes sense! Battle during this time period was especially horrific with cannons pounding into the infantry to soften them up and cavalry sweeping down on rows of men the heavy blades. Cornwall has a knack for making the reader smell the spent black powder and feel the splashing of warm blood.<br />The fascinating aspect of this series is that Richard Sharpe is a war crazed soldier, seeking battle with joy in his heart. He really loves to fight and make war with no apologies and no analysis. This is the characteristic that makes the character so refreshing and exciting.soldier, seeking battle with joy in his heart.

I guess that is the curse of the writer that writes &quot;genre&quot; fiction. Estelman is one of the best writers working today. His characterization is first rate, and his dialogue is second to none. Also, Estleman is an expert on the American West and it really shows in this novel. His sentences are always chisled and perfect. Briefly, this book tells the tale of two gunman that are pursued by the law, and their fates and lives intertwine.<br />A truely wonderful look at the American West. There is a great deal of action and a kind of hard, flinty humor that this author specializes in.<br />Even if you do not like &quot;Westerns&quot; give this book a try. If you do like Westerns, you won't need me to confince you. You will already know what a gifted writer Estleman is.	2003-08-29
US	51092072	R3UH6MORYU33LF	0812584376	915781970	The Master Executioner	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	A Master Writer	No one writes a better western than Loren D. Estleman. In The Master Executioner, Estleman tells the story of a hangman in the middle of the 19th century. As is always the case with this author, the reader is treated to incredible dialogue and characters that are immediately drawn with a few expert lines and details. I will not give away the ending, suffice to say this is a terribly sad novel about a complex and very unique man. Estleman is too fine a writer to pull at your heartstrings in a clich&eacute;d or obvious way. The man character, Executioner Oscar Stone, is not the sort of character that would easily win a reader's sympathy. He is, first and foremost, a hangman. He is also a hard, cold individual never at ease among his fellow humans. Yet, in Estleman's expert hands, this character lives and breaths and, finally, effects the reader very deeply.<br />Estleman is also the master of the authentic western. This book contains rich, detailed portraits of western towns, both large and small, from this time period. He is always accurate in the details, and I always feel Estleman gives me the most accurate portrait of how things really must have been in the West, more so than any other author. For the best taste of this, one should read Bloody Season by this author for the best account of the Shootout at the OK Corral.<br />Fascinating characters and great, original writing. Buy this book. You will not regret it.	2003-08-18

I have bought every edition of this book (this is the fourth) and find each one well worth the money. Thomson is the best writer among the movie critics, probably the best writer that has ever reviewed movies. His writing is so good, even when disagreeing with him, I still love reading the reviews or biographical sketches. He has a tremendous poetic economy with the English Language: consider the following:<br />About Bruce Dern in the film Coming Home:<br />\\". . . A rapturous embrace between Jane Fonda and Jon Voight was being watched by a wistful, suspicious Bruce Dern, his eyes lime pits of paranoia and resentment.\\"<br />Or Basil Rathbone:<br />\\"The inverted arrow face, the razor nose, and a mustache that was really two fine shears stuck to his lip. Ladies looked fearfully at him, knowing that one embrace could cut them to ribbons.\\"<br />Both these passages capture the essence of the star perfectly. Just perfectly. The book is full of this kind of superior writing.<br />The update has all the new stars, some who probably wish they were excluded. Who can not  read a reviewer that says of Ben Affleck: &quot;. . .

It tells the story of female aviator in Africa, and the tone is cultured and somewhat reserved. The silly gushings this book has inspired sound more like the chantings of a cult than real reviews. I think this book sneaks up on folks as it was written by a woman, an aviator, not known to be a writer.

One story concerns itself with the monumental challenge the actual construction of the fair presented to the various architects, engineers, and landscape artists involved in the event. The other story tells the tale of murderer H.H. Holmes, who constructed a large hotel near the fair to accommodate the young, female tourists needing a room for the event. Holmes, in fact, had constructed a murder factory, complete with gas chambers, crematorium, and chemical decomposition facilities. There is a third story which makes brief appearances as well: the story of Patrick Prendergast, the sad lunatic that stalked and killed Chicago Mayor Carter Harrison just as the fair was wrapping up.<br />This is an extremely ambitious book. Too ambitious. For me, the story of the architects and the trails in constructing the fair was fascinating and more than sufficient to carry the book. I had no idea the fair of 1893 was so towering an undertaking. They basically built a city within a city, complete with fire and police departments, municipal workers, and political offices - all built on earth that was, in essence, a quicksand-like foundation that had no real bedrock. The stresses and ultimate successes of this side of the story are captivating and incredible.<br />The anecdotal stories about the fair make wonderful reading, my favorite being the story of George Ferris and his incredible Ferris Wheel, which was built to outshine the Eiffel Tower, introduced at the Paris fair a few years earlier (which it did in spades).<br />The Book fell flat for me whenever the author undertook to tell the story of H.H. Holmes, the handsome, smooth con man who many call the first serial killer in American history. In the book, these episodes feel unfocused and hasty. Particularly rushed and episodic was the description of Holmes' pursuit and eventual conviction by Pinkerton Detective, Frank Geyer. When reading these portions of the book, I felt myself whishing the author had dedicated a book just to this aspect of his tale. Mr. Larson has sensed the great story that lies in wait for the telling, but hasn't given himself the space or time to tell it well.<br />Read it for the magnificent, melancholy story of the engineers, artists and architects, whose ultimate triumph came at such sad, personal costs.

For my own tastes, I would have preferred a little less about the office politics of the U.S. Weather Bureau and more about the mighty hurricane that destroyed Galveston, Texas in 1900. The book doesn't really take off until the monster makes landfall, and then the story gathers speed and interest very quickly. The author, Erik Larson, has a good eye for detail and a good clean way of writing about terribly moving a tragic moments: a child's rocking horse washed up along inland railroad tracks, corpse pyres in the aftermath creating illumination along the beach like \\"suns about to rise\\", and many other moments like these flash throughout the second half of the book.<br />The Galveston Hurricane was a watershed for the advancement of hurricane prediction, as it became an urgent matter to avoid the horrific death tolls such as this storm produced. One aspect of this book is a depiction of the U.S. Weather Bureau during the storm, and it is not a complimentary portrait. It is the author's view that the huge death tolls of this storm might have been avoided if the U.S. Weather Bureau had been willing to listen to the Cuban forecasters, which had predicted the advance of a large hurricane; that in fact, the US Bureau was stubborn and dismissive of the Cuban meteorologists. Yet, as the author writes, the Cubans seemed to call every puff of wind that crossed their island a \\"hurricane,\\" so how could you take them seriously? I feel the author's need to find fault with the U.S. Bureau for the high death toll is simply an example of the very current need to place the blame, from the comfort of 20/20 hindsight, of every bad event on somebody.<br />After reading this book, it seems to me that no one, anywhere, had the technology in 1900 to predict or track hurricanes effectively, and the Cuban Bureau, by calling every storm a hurricane, got this one right (as they were bound to eventually). Nonetheless, I enjoyed this book a great deal, and would recommend it.s book a great deal, and would recommend it.	2003-03-26

After reading Stanley's \\"Into the Dark Continent,\\" and liking it a great deal, I was instructed by other readers to read \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" if I wanted to know \\"the truth.\\" I have read it, and the primary effect of having done so is to make me wonder about the transitory and ambiguous nature of the concept of \\"truth.\\"<br />Hochschild's book tells the tale of King Leopold II of Belgium and his decisive land grab of the Congo in the late 19th century, and also of Leopold's use of Henry Morton Stanley as a public relation's tool and a kind of \\"My man in Africa.\\"<br />In short, I have found the work terribly biased and slanted to the author's views. It is not a bad book, or badly researched in general. It is certainly worth reading as part of the literature of the time and place, but the author has come to the work with a point of view, which is obvious. Particularly his picture of the African explore, H.M. Stanley. His portrait of Stanley is lifted almost entirely from Bierman's \\"Dark Safari: The Life behind the Legend of Henry Morton Stanley\\" which has been for years a shamefully hateful and incomplete picture of Stanley, but the source that is currently considered the \\"true\\" portrait of the great explorer (Stanley's own autobiography is still the only source for his early life, but the author roundly dismisses it, of course, for its presumed embellishments).<br />Hochschild's picture of Stanley is the currently popular one: a massively insecure man given to self-promotion; a driven individual with a compulsive need to prove himself, stemming largely from his orphaned and neglected childhood. Thus the book is riddled with amateur psychology and wild leaps of faith and assumption regarding Stanley's motives and thoughts. For example:<br />\\"With every step he took in Africa, Stanley planned how to tell the story once he got home.\\"<br />\\". . . he was always sculpting the details of his own celebrity.\\"<br />\\"Livingston was haloed in Stanley's prose, for he was the noble father figure the younger man had long been looking for . . .\\"<br />None of these things the author has any way of knowing, and are all armchair assumptions. They reveal the author's own views, and the book is full of such opinions put down as fact.<br />One of the book's praised heroes is George Washington Williams, a black American and sometime journalist who wrote of the miserable conditions of blacks in Africa. Looking at the details of this man's life, a reader with a cynical eye might concluded this man was simply a bunko artist looking for the most profitable hustle. Throughout his many and various \\"careers\\" he lied about going to Harvard, he lied about having a doctoral degree, and he abandoned his wife and fifteen year old son to escape mounting debt that resulted from his various failed schemes - only to become engaged during a shipboard romance just before his death. One might expect a writer of Hochschild's obviously distaste for self-promoters would cast a cynical gaze to anything Williams might write about Africa. Surely, as he so keenly observed with Stanley, the author might assume that Williams had traveled to Africa to make a public relations splash for himself after his sensational writings of Africa. But, no, this is not the case. For Hochschild, Williams's writings of Africa \\"were a cry of outrage that came from the heart.\\" Once again, the slippery nature of truth is a matter of interpretation.<br />So, what is true? At the time of publication, Stanley's \\"Into the Dark Continent,\\" was considered true. Most Europeans believed that Africa was full of poor, unenlightened blacks living in squalor, subject to the whims of brutal rulers and slave traders; beings who desperately needed our help and the Christian faith. Today, Hochschild boosts the popular belief that Africa at the turn of the century was full of a contented people living in a workable, peaceful society, which was destroyed by the avarice and greed of white Europeans. What will be the truth in a hundred years?<br />So, finally, what is true? Well, that depends. What do you want to believe?ll be the truth in a hundred years?<br />So, finally, what is true?

Not all at once, but slowly . . .&quot;	Reading the reviews of this book, I expected a thrilling, well-told adventure. It exceeded my expectations and, like many other reviewers, I found that after a certain point in the book I simply couldn't put the book down. It would have been like leaving those brave men alone in the freezing ice and water. The events described in this book are so well known, suffice to say this is the story of Earnest Shackleton's 1914 Arctic expedition, in which Shackleton and his men hoped to cross the continent on foot. They never even made landfall, and their ship was trapped, and then slowly crushed in the ice. Thus begins the incredible story.<br />One of the strengths of the book is the elegant, slowly building power of Alfred Lansing's prose. He hits the perfect pitch, not sensational and yet not a dry retelling of facts. His writing is very clean, cuts right to the quick, and is full of perfect details. The book is also full of journal entries from several of the men, and most of these are masterpieces of understatement and courage. I won't even begin to describe the elements and details of the hardships these men faced. I simply don't know how they kept going, kept trying, in the face of such awesome, soul-crushing circumstances.<br />This book, to say the least, is a testament to the survival instinct in men - the surprising deep need the human animal has to simply stay alive, no matter what.

It is really very hard to appreciate Stanley's accomplishments from today's perspective. In 1874, Stanley left Zanzibar. By 1877, he had crossed the continent and reached the Atlantic Ocean. There is nothing modern man can do that would equal this accomplishment.<br /><br />Today's daring adventurers climb rocks or mountains or go bungee jumping. Stanley was traveling into the unknown. Not even space exploration today holds the quality of the unknown, as did Africa in Stanley's time. The hardship he faced during this time was unbelievable by today's standards. His circumnavigation of Lake Victoria alone contained a constant stream of near death scrapes that not only required staggering amounts of physical courage, but a mental toughness as well.<br /><br />A lot of the reviews I have read on this work focus on Stanley's political incorrectness. I urge a closer reading of the work. Stanley was actually extremely open minded and, more than anything, fair in his views and certainly very progressive. When discussing the character of the African natives, Stanley was of the opinion that \\"they are, in short, equal to any other race or colour on the face of the globe, in all the attributes of manhood.\\" Stanley was an insightful enough observer to draw comparisons between African legends and Christian beliefs, giving each equal respect and recognizing their similarities. Stanley even at one point performs the ceremony of blood-brotherhood with the famous chief Mirambo, which involved the sharing of blood by mutual cuts on the leg.<br /><br />I would suggest that Stanley was not only a progressive during his own time, but for any time. He judged men simply by deeds, nothing more or less. If only Stanley recieved the same standard of judgement. In Stanley's time, so much was unknown, and the world seemed so large and rich. In our time, so much more is known, and yet our world has become so narrow, specialized and petty. There can never be another man like Stanley. We are all far more interested in watching a teenager eat a plate of worms on \\"Fear Factor.\\"t our world has become so narrow, specialized and petty. There can never be another man like Stanley.

Barnes. As Mr. Forker states himself in the acknowledgements of this book, Barnes' book is the one by which all other works on cartridges will be judged. \\"Ammo and Ballistics\\" is a great reference work in its own right, though, filling a slightly different niche than \\"Cartridges of the World.\\" The writing, including cartridge history and current opinion, is better in the Barnes book. Also, the Barnes book has a full-sized photo of each cartridge, including obsolete cartridges. Barnes' work has a well-rounded, complete feel to it, and if the world of cartridges fascinates you, as it does me, you will find yourself reading Barnes' classic work for pleasure as well as for the wealth of useful information contained. This is why, for my uses, I prefer the Barnes book. But if you are a hunter, or for some other reason need the lowdown on exterior ballistics, for heavens' sake do yourself a favor and buy the Forker book as well. Mr. Forker supplies page after page of velocity, energy, and trajectory tables for each cartridge. There is a wealth of data here, well presented, covering factory loadings for each cartridge. Antoher useful tidbit of the Forker book is felt recoil factor of each cartridge, so a shooter can compare the felt recoil of each cartridge. No kidding, this book delivers the goods with regards to performance information. I also liked the guest articles by Graig T. Boddington, which are included. Anything Boddington writes, you can take to the bank.	2003-02-19

This is the book I used when I got started reloading about a year ago, and this book gave me just what I needed. When I first got the itch to load my own ammunition, I was overwhelmed by the amount of information and terminology involved in this fascinating field/hobby. It was very difficult to take all the individual pieces of information that I had and form it into an understandable process. I was snowed in under a blizzard of data that I was piecing together through chat rooms and web sites. Everyone was very helpful - basically shooters are the most helpful people I know - but still I was just getting fragments without a solid, complete overview. Phrases like \\"roll crimp\\", \\"seating and sizer dies,\\" and \\"headspace\\" came at me in a blizzard. I could look up each phrase, understand each one as a piece, but still the whole picture was fuzzy. In essence, that is what this book will do for you: turn it all into a coherent, linear whole. The writing is very solid and clear, the illustrations are well done and helpful, and the information is very complete. After reading this book, the entire process made sense to me, and more importantly, I was fully warned about the does and don'ts of the reloading world. The coverage is very complete. Primers, powders, bullets and cases are explained with regard to nomenclature and history. All necessary tools and accessories are discussed and explained. This is just a great book. It won't make you an expert, but it will put you on the right road if you wish to become one.	2003-02-19

It is a great combination of both factual data about subjective, expert opinion about a very large selection of standard handguns. The author gives the history of the weapon, the technical data, and shooting impressions. This is one of the few resources that give all three. The photographs are very good (not glossy but still very good), and the writing is clear and concise without being dry. The information is well organized with an excellent index. Finally, the author includes \\"classic\\" service handguns no longer in production as well as current models. Every gun I have been interested in has been in this book. I have read it from cover to cover just for pleasure reading. It is that good. If you are interested in firearms, I highly recommend it. The only downside is that it only comes in paperback, and I had to buy a second copy because I wore out my first one!	2003-02-14

This is the most beautiful, illustrated reference work for handguns and revolvers that I have ever seen, and I've seen a bunch. The paper is slick and glossy, and the photographs are superb and rich in detail and color. This is a drool-inducing work if you love firearms. The information provided is very complete and concise, so it is valuable in a technical, reference sense, but lets not kid ourselves - this oversized book was designed to be aesthetically beautiful and it hits that mark and then some. This is a lavish, coffee table book that is a useful reference tool as well.	2003-02-14

The dialogue in the book, particularly the conversations of the gangsters, rings horribly false - more like privileged writers concepts of how gangsters talk. Page after page has that over-writerly feel, if you know what I mean. When a book is really good, you are not really conscious of the writer. In this book, you can practically sense Mr. Kerr patting himself on the back for another great line. The main character, a hit man named \\"Thomas Jefferson\\" comes off as an extremely labored, mannered creation. Compare this character with \\"The Jackal\\" in Fredrick Forsyth's book, and you will see what I mean. One seems extremely believable and real, one seems like a writer's concept of a killer. I don't normally pick details, but the whole book turned silly for me when the author had a character \\"thumb back the safety\\" on a Smith & Wesson .38 revolver. This is kind of a classic writer's blunder that I didn't think any writer could make anymore, what with the advent of quick Internet research, but apparently it still happens. Revolvers do not have safeties. This alone would not have tanked the book for me, though. It was just kind of indicative of the essential falseness of the work.	2003-02-12

The writer, Col. J.H. Patterson, was an engineer sent to Africa to work on the \\"Lunatic Express\\", a stretch of rail that spanned Africa. Several obstacles confronted him, not the last of which was a pair of mane-less lions that went on a man-eating spree that lightened the coolie labor force by about 30 workers and an unrecorded number of African workers. Several things become apparent as one reads this work: first, the unbelievable hubris of the British Empire, personified in the person of Patterson. By the end of the book, I was won over by this clearly Victorian man, who without any specific training simply sorted out whatever problem came his way, including the hunting and killing of the two lions. This feat in itself required a staggering amount of courage and determination. This book is a glimpse into the soul, both good and bad, of the Empire on which the sun never set: Patterson was incredibly brave, smart, maybe even noble - and never once saw a native African as anything other than faithful or amusing.	2003-02-11

It describes American involvement in Vietnam. While my position about Vietnam has changed considerably as the years pass, the impact of this book still leaves me with fond feelings for the skillful way the writer describes the ever-deepening quicksand that Vietnam became for our country. The writer describes the horrible descent-into-hell Vietnam became as the rural population flooded into urban areas, turning them into pits of filth and degradation for all that lived there. Fitzgerald describes the mistakes and bad luck, line by line, until, as one Vietnamese official of the time described it, America had fallen into a downward spiral. A tragic and moving book.	2003-01-31

In these politically correct times, he was fallen into disfavor, and that is a crying shame. His terse, lean lines are so easy to mock today, but what people forget is that he created that style, molded it and trimmed it down from the long-winded, more European style of writing that was so popular before his advent. As a short story writer, he is the master. Not a wasted word, and every word carved in its perfect place. When a Hemingway character plunges their arm into a cold stream, the reader can feel the ice cold numbing the fingers. His short story, \\"The Short, Happy Life of Francis Macomber\\" turned me onto reading as a teenager. So much came from him, and so much still comes from him. Raymond Carver, James Ellroy, Elmore Leonard and many others all walk a clear path that he cut through thick brush.	2003-01-31

As Hunter Thompson said about this book, read it and see &quot;how the big boys write.&quot; Fitzgerald had a tragic sense of the world that is always there behind the money and bright surfaces of his characters. His ability to convey this melancholy is nearly supernatural. What more can be said about this book? This is the writing of one of the greatest writers that ever lived. His talent was so great, not even his self-destructive nature could dim the light. His Jay Gatsby is still so classically American, and this novel is one for the space capsule.	2003-01-31

Peter Hathaway Capstick had a real knack for putting the reader right there in the tall grass, feeling the heat and the fear of an African hunt. His description of a charging lion put the fear of God in me, that's for sure. Also, his writing style is full of self-depreciating humor and honesty. He had a real way with words and his books are all classics in the field. If you have ever wanted to go on a safari, read this book. It is refreshing to read his descriptions of hunting with no apologies. Consider the way he expresses his love of dangerous game hunting: \\"That is man against himself, the last and purest of the challenges that made us men, not animals.\\" Either that rings true or it doesn't.	2003-01-31

This is a wonderful book to just sit and read for pleasure as well as being a great reference resource. The history of each cartridge is discussed, as well as the author's personal thoughts on each cartridge. The author is a clear, concise writer without being dull, and the range of cartridges covered is very complete. I have used it often. I am currently reading Peter Hathaway Capstick's book, \\"Death in the Long Grass\\", which tells of his African hunting experiences. Capstick mentions several dangerous game cartridges, such as the .375 H&H Magnum and the .470 Nitro Express. I looked both up in this book and read about their histories. One very cool thing about the book is that each cartridge is pictured actual size. These big game cartridges are as big as cigars and go about 300 to 400 grain in weight (compared to one of my favorite cartridges, 30-30 win, which is usually about 150 grain). Included in the book are obsolete cartridges and those fascinating wildcat cartridges, such as the author's own creation, called the \\"thermos bottle\\" which must be seen to be believed. If firearm cartridges interest you for any reason you should have this book.	2003-01-31

Although I only gave this title 3 stars, I would have liked to give it 3.5 or even 3.75. Follett's prose is always clean and tight, with no additives. While I thought Hornet Flight not as good as Follett's best work (eye of the Needle, Key to Rebecca), I would not call it disappointing. There were one or two scenes that rank with his best, and stay with the reader after the book is done. It just lacked the single- minded focus and action of his best stuff. There were a few historical appearances, and side plots and romances, that diffused the main conflict in the story, which was a contest between a Danish policeman (who works hand-in-hand with the occupying Nazi's during WWII, and a Danish student and resistance fighter, Harald Olufsen. What made me keep turning pages in this novel was the interesting way the author handled the villain, Peter Flemming. He is given much depth by Follett, and he is not just a paper cut out bad guy. He has a strong sense of duty, he is very smart, and he has risen through the ranks by ability rather that birth. The personal life the author gives this character is very detailed, and had me at times sympathizing with him. In fact, Follett does a better job in describing Peter Flemming than he does characterizing the hero, Harald. Harald at times seems a bit wooden, simply brave and noble at all times.	2002-12-29

I like this book as much as I liked Rose, which was another historical thriller/mystery by this author. All the standard Cruz-Smith strengths are in play here: economical, smooth prose; great, cutting dialogue; and tremendous characterization. This book is also extremely well plotted, and the pacing is simply incredible. Harry Niles is the kind of protagonist that this author has a patent on: a survivor as opposed to a standard, cookie-cutter &quot;hero.&quot; There is nothing heroic about Harry Niles. He is a hustler and a con man - the only son of missionary parents who makes his own way in Japan just before World War II. As one character observes, Harry is a &quot;fish that could live in a tree if he had too.&quot; Also, this author creates the most interesting and frightening villains in fiction. His Ishigami, a samurai run amok, is spellbinding. Lastly, this book is a fascinating look into another time and another culture. Buy this book. You will not be disappointed.	2002-12-15

I found the book fascinating. It is the best thing out there for understanding firearms ballistics, and anyone interested in the complex science of ballistics must have a copy on the shelf. Having said that, the book is presented terribly. The typeface is hard to read (and for information this densely packed, an agreeable typeface is important). The charts and diagrams are simply terrible. They look hand-drawn, and badly at that. Also, the author spends too much time defending himself from a badly recieved (in some math quarters) earlier edition and only manages to make it sound too personal. On the plus side the author is very encouraging to those of us that are mathamatically challanged. all in all, I learned and understood an enormous amount of information from this book, and consider it a classic in the field. There is nothing else quite like it.	2002-11-14

The book's protaganist, Jonathan Blair, is a fascinating, complex character - so much different from the stock tough guys other mystery writers turn out. Also, the book brings to vivid life a Victorian mining town in all its black, hard detail. Other characters in the book have the same complexity and depth as the book's \\"hero\\". The physical action in the book is horryifying in its brutality, but the real thrill of the book is realizing the incredibly hard center of will that Blair carries within him at all times, driving him through hardships and humiliation that will make the reader wince.

I think this is one of Hunter's best books. As always, the technical info about all aspects of gun fighting is very accurate without bogging the story down (as so often happens when a writer seems overly eager to display his knowledge of weaponry).  The story, about a World War II hero hired to help clean up organized crime in Hot Springs, Arkansas, is totally gripping in it's recreation of time and place. For fans of Hunter's work, it is fascinating reading about Bob Lee Swagger's (the hero of many Hunter novels) father and learning his story.  Overall, the author seems to strike a deeper tone emotionally in this work than any work previously.  Also, the book is at times very dry and funny, particularly the scenes between Bugsy Segal and Virginia Hill, two actual characters of the time and place. Just a great read. This is one of those rare summer thrillers that touch the periphery of \\"literature\\".  A wonderful book.	2001-11-05
