It wasn't adding an \\"unnecessary\\" love scene (as so many authors are guilty of) but showed the couple's love.  The entire scene was romantic without being sappy.  <br />If I continue I will end up spoiling the fun so let me end this by saying I look forward to all future books by this amazing author, especially Chase's story :)	2003-03-25

Wouldn't it surprise Benedict to know he has just saved his Silver Lady?  Not expecting his mystery woman to be part of the working class, recognition is not part of the deal, at least for Benedict.

This story answers the question that has been asked through the centuries - what is love?  I'll let Lucifer give his opinion:<br />\\"It took a while to work out, but there's only one explanation.\\" His lips twisted wryly; he looked into Phyllida's eyes.  \\"And I now know what Martha was trying to metaphysically jog my elbow about that first day.\\" \\"What?\\" \\"You.  Not just you but the possibility of what we could share.  Martha was trying to tell me to open my eyes so I wouldn't miss it.\\" He glanced around again; his arms tightened as he brought his gaze back to her face.  \\"Horatio re-created Martha's garden because he realized, as I now do, that you can't turn aside from love.  You can't choose to love - it doesn't work like that - but once you do love, you love forever.  You can't move counties and leave it behind; it stays with you, in your heart, your mind - it becomes part of your soul.  Horatio re-created the garden for the same reason Martha created it in the first place - as his expression of his love for her and recognition of her love for him.  Martha was still with Horatio when he died - I know that as definitely as I stand here with you.  They're still here, both of them, memories living within this garden.  Their love, shared love, created it; while it lives, their love lives, too.\\" His lips twisted again, this time in self-deprecation.  \\"For all that we - the men in my family - try to avoid love, for the best and most logical of reasons, when it strikes, there's not one of us, not through all the generations, who has turned his back and walked away.  For us, not walking away is harder, more frightening, than fighting any battle, but if there's one thing I've learned from my family, its that surrendering to love, to the demands of love, is the only road to real happiness.\\" \\"While I've seen love in action in my family, I've learned a great deal from Horatio and Martha.  Love simply is - it asks no permission. Acceptance is all that love asks, the only demand it makes, but it is an absolute one.  You can either admit it to your heart, or refuse it, but there's no other option.\\" Isn't that the most romantic passage you've ever read?!?<br />Stephanie Laurens has the unique ability to create a series where each book is a masterpiece unto itself.  No two stories are alike yet all share a common thread: Love, family, honor, adventure and protection.  Stephanie has my sincerest gratitude for a series so wonderful it leaves me breathless!  The epilogue was a beautiful tribute to the Bar Cynster and a wonderful closing to a story well done!<br />Alasdair Reginald \\"Lucifer\\" Cynster is a hero in every sense of the word.  His sensuality is only surpassed by his intelligence, and he needs every ounce of both to sway his ladylove - not to mention protect her from a killer and herself.<br />Phyllida Tallent, beautiful in her own right is independent to a fault. As the caregiver of an entire village, she is not ready to relinquish control to an amazingly handsome rogue.  Little does she know the choice was never hers to make!<br />The Series: All About Love is the final chapter of the Bar Cynster and I, for one, am sorry to see it end. Devil's Bride, A Rake's Vow, Scandal's Bride, A Rogue's Proposal, A Secret Love and All About Love is a collection that deserves your undivided attention.  I look forward to the spin-off books about the Twins, Chillingworth, Devil's parents and Simon.  You will too!	2001-02-07

Christine Feehan is an unbelievable author.  She has created a genre all her own and has hooked this reader forever!<br />Although each &quot;Dark&quot; book is unique, Dark Challenge held you captivated for more than one reason.  It introduced you to some of the history of the Carpathians, including Gregori's family believed to have died in the Turk Wars and of the two ancient twins - Gabriel and Lucien.  It was also the first romance between two ancient Carpathians.<br />Desari was the singer targeted by the human assassins.  Gregori sent Julian to warn her of the impending threat.  She is beautiful, she is powerful and she is an Ancient Carpathian female.  She also happens to be Gregori's sister and Julian's lifemate.  Let the games begin :)<br />Julian Savage, brother to Aidan (of Dark Gold) and student of the great healer Gregori (Dark Magic) has given up and is willing to meet the dawn.  With one last task to complete he is prepared to face the sun and rid himself of this solitary existence and the dark shadow in his soul.  Little did he know his last task would be protecting his lifemate and her band.  Talk about family problems!  Darius, her older brother (who just happens to remind him of a certain healer), two unattached males (Dayan and Barack), an unattached female (Syndil) and those crazy leopards!  Gregori was going to owe him big-time for this favor ... but he was more than up to the task!<br />This book had everything: love, romance, intrigue, adventure and humor.  Read it, you won't be sorry!	2001-01-25

We first meet Jacques Dubrinsky in Dark Prince as the carefree, fun-loving brother to the Prince.  As we open the pages of Dark Desire we see that personality shattered as he is tortured and betrayed by one close to him.  The only mind path he has left is to an American, Shea O'Halloran - who let him suffer and refused to help.  Now the only reason Jaques continues to live is to make her pay - little does he know she is his lifemate!<br />Although Dark Prince will always be my favorite, Dark Desire came in a pretty close second.  The anguish that Jacques feels and the suffering he endures is so intense, you feel his pain.  The connection Shea feels to this tortured soul is unmistakable and from that, their relationship changes and grows.  <br />This was a more intense read than Dark Prince, but just as intriguing.  Of course, having Mikhail, Raven, Byron and Gregori throughout the book was an added plus.  I was facinated by the plot with its connection to Dark Prince and the ending was absolutely incredible!<br />Christine Feehan is a unique author and I for one cannot wait until her next installment!	2001-01-25

Lynsay Sands is a relatively new author but she is the type of author who will be around for many years to come!  A while back I was in the mood for a really funny medieval book... two were recommended to me - Love at First Sight by Sandra Lee and The Deed by Lynsay Sands.  Both books are fabulous but I must admit that The Deed has something extra special.  The author has a way of involving you in the story that will surprise you and captivate you.  She is absolutely wonderful and she is already an &quot;autobuy&quot; for me!<br />The thing that I remember the most about The Deed (I read it quite a while ago) was I felt as though I was running a marathon.  My heart was pumping, my mind was racing and I couldn't catch my breath (because I was laughing so hard) - and this was all in the first chapter!  The story is about Lady Emmaline Eberhart's desire to have her husband commit the &quot;deed&quot; and yes I am talking about SEX!  She even pleads with the King to force him to do his &quot;duty&quot; to her.  Unfortunately her husband dies and she is ordered to remarry.  If her new husband does not perform the &quot;deed&quot; quickly she will lose her inheritance to her late husband's cousin... this particular scene is priceless and if you choose not to read this book at least read the first two chapters.  I promise you that you will be rolling on the floor laughing!<br />Lady Emmaline Eberhart is determined not to remain an innocent and trust me &quot;innocent&quot; is too strong a word for her.  She has beauty and grace and at times she semms a bit silly but you can't help to love her (probably because of her talent for making you laugh... how could you dislike someone who makes you smile so much) and the things she does to Amaury are hysterical.  I laughed with this book from beginning to end and now that I think about it I can't help but smiling!<br />Amaury de Aneford is gorgeous (did you have a doubt?) who also happens to be a landless knight who is willing tomarry solely for the purpose of obtaining a home - the most important thing to him.  Little did he realize the wife he was gaining would steal his heart.  <br />I will love this book for the laughs it brought me.  If you are afraid to laugh in public do not read this book anywhere but behind closed doors!  You won't be able to stop yourself... it is that funny!	2001-01-19

At the local ubs I was in a &quot;vampire&quot; mood and came across Prince of Dreams by Susan which was the story of a vampire told in a very unique way.  Although I did enjoy the story - enough for me to search out her other titles, nothing prepared me for Prince of Wolves.  A hauntingly beautiful love story that will stay with you for a very long time.  Susan's writing is extremely detailed, very informative and flows quite easily.  Her stories are longer than most but I consider that a plus!<br />Prince of Wolves is a story about werewolves, as a race.  It is also about love and happily ever after but more importantly it is the story of possibilities.  This is not some far-fetched, way out there type book about some evil beings... it is well-written and almost (I do stress the almost) makes you want to believe in the possibility of a race of this kind.  Intense and powerful with a plot that will continually surprise you.<br />Joelle Randall was a strong heroine with normal human weaknesses.  She had beauty, grace and intelligence (a requirement in every heroine as far as I am concerned) but what she also had was faith.  Her trust in what could not be possible gave her a sort of inner glow that was both positive and alluring.  <br />Luke Gévaudan.  Well what can you say about a man that is part wolf... Sexy doesn't cover it!   He was a legend come true and he made you believe in the impossible!  He was clever, he was strong and loving and power just oozed out of his pores.  <br />I absolutely fell in love with everything about this book.  All of the characters, main, secondary, villain... everyone played an important role and each voice was crucial to the story.  Susan has a unique way of blending a story together and thankfully this book has sequels!  Prince of Shadows, Touch of the Wolf and Once a Wolf.<br />If you're in the mood for something wild, read Prince of Wolves!	2001-01-19

She is witty, she is charming and she is downright funny!  All of her books are my favorites and I am lucky enough to own each and every one!  Tracking down Dancing at Midnight was a bit tough (before it was republished) but I have always believed that if its out there, its obtainable!  Any book written by Julia Quinn is wonderful.<br />I love &quot;How to Marry a Marquis&quot; more than her other books because it reminds me so much of any young woman faced with the challenge of LOVE.  When the book the Rules came out it shot to the top of the bestsellers' list because every woman wanted to know what the trick was, how to snag a husband!  Now I am not saying that I agree with the book or its intentions, thankfully my husband was never a gameplayer so I was very lucky but there were times in my younger years that I dated men that thought nothing of not calling and so on, you get the drift.  But I digress, reading this book by Julia Quinn brought back memories that now, thankfully, make me laugh out loud! <br />Elizabeth Hotchkiss is a beautiful, family-oriented, clumsy female who wants nothing more than to provide for her family.  She is even willing to marry for it, although not Squire Nevins... he was too horrid to even contemplate.  Working for Lady Danbury she came across a little red book entitled How to Marry a Marquis and that was when her life changed!  This particular heroine had all the insecurities and worries that most young woman face even in this day and age not to mention a ton of responsibilities.  I admired her drive and her commitment. The situations she gets into will have you laughing out loud!<br />James Siddon (Estate Manager)/James Sidwell (Marquis of Riverdale) is simply beautiful.  He was gorgeous in To Catch an Heiress (prequel to this book) and got more handsome as you began to know him.  He comes to his Aunt's summon and poses as the Estate Manager to ferret out the blackmailer, little does he know he isbeing manipulated to fall in love!  Funny, funny, funny!<br />Actually I should just title this paragraph &quot;Secondary Characters&quot; because they are just as important to me as the Hero and Heroine!  I don't think a truly good read can be without them! Lady (Agatha) Danbury is a spunky old broad that is as clever as they come.  Malcolm the Cat is more human then some of the characters I've read in other books.  Then of course there are the Siblings...  Susan, Lucas and Jane (Elizabeth's siblings), who are priceless.  They are heartwarming, touching and lovable - not to mention a handful most of the time.  <br />The characters, the storyline and the laughter all make this book wonderful.  Give it a chance if you haven't already had the pleasure.	2001-01-19

Marsha Canham has a wonderful writing style and I must admit I had a real problem picking my favorite book from her!  This particular series (The Black Wolf series - Through a Dark Mist, In The Shadow of Midnight and The Last Arrow) is simply incredible!<br />Through a Dark Mist is a dramatic story in the style of Robin Hood. This book has everything - legend, swashbuckling romance, fantasy, adventure, rollicking good humor, wildly exciting escapades, cliffhangers, and most of all, smoldering sensuality!  Lady Servanne de Briscourt is on her way to meet her betrothed Lucien (The Dragon) de Gournay, when her party is attacked by brigands led by the notorious Black Wolf. <br />Lady Servanne de Briscourt.  She is beautiful and strong and very independent.  Her interaction with the Wolf's band of outlaws is funny, touching and always interesting - but her love for The Wolf is breathtaking.  Maid Marian has nothing on this heroine!<br />The Black Wolf.  Oh how I wish this book was made into a movie just to see who they would cast in this part!  He would have to be a combination of actors: Douglas Fairbanks with a dash of Mel Gibson, add in some Kevin Costner and maybe just a tad bit of Errol Flynn and I think you would have your perfect Wolf!  He is timeless and he is eternity all rolled up into one.  Throughout the series (two sequels) there is still the quality that draws you to him throughout his years!  If you dare to read about The Wolf, you chance melting into a puddle of sensations!<br />As always the secondary characters are of the utmost importance to me and fortunately I was not let down.  Every character in this book - including the villain (the &quot;Dragon&quot;) deserves an honorable mention because they were exceptional.  <br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough!  You will just have to read it - there is no other choice in the matter!	2001-01-19

Who cared that she looked like a hag and hated him on sight (talk about having to gain someone's trust), Alexandria Houton was the woman for him!  Once he was able to heal her that is.<br />This book was a little different from the previous books and although Mikhail is mentioned, only Gregori makes an appearance.  It takes place in San Francisco and has a more modern feel to it.  Not to mention more family: Aidan has adopted a &quot;human&quot; family (Maria and Stefan), not to mention his brother Julian Savage (who has his own story in Dark Challenge) and Alexandria little brother Joshua.<br />Although this story was very good I found it missing that &quot;extra, special something&quot; that Dark Prince and Dark Desire had.  Maybe it was his appearance (Aidan and Julian are the &quot;golden twins&quot; where everyone else is dark) or maybe it was the lack of Carpathians involved, I'm not sure.  The book was very good but in order to be a 5 star book, it has to be extra special!	2001-01-18

Reality set in when he realized his beautiful savior owned the very heart he broke so many years ago!<br />Arabella Hadley loved Lucien forever, heart, mind and soul - not to mention body - and that is what caused all this trouble to begin with!

Shapeshifting, mind control and their own brand of justice - these beings are unique, enthralling and terribly exciting!  If you enjoy the darker side of romance, love with a slight chill running down your spine read The Dark Series!<br />Mikhail Dubrinsky is the oldest existing Carpathian, he is considered one of the Ancients - although he looks like a fallen angel.  His power is incredible, his responsibilities are enormous and his law is absolute.  Yet his destiny lies in the soul of one petite woman who is both exquisite and intelligent, not to mention human.  Of course, what else would his lifemate be?<br />Raven Whitney never thought her psychic abilities would bring her the love of her life, nor did she realize he would change her life forever!  The only thing she knew for sure was that she loved this arrogant, totally male being with all of her heart and there was nothing she wouldn't do to make him smile, unless he became too sure of himself... then she'd have to put him in his place :)<br />Come and join the family!

I was a little concerned when I heard that Julie Garwood wrote a &quot;romantic suspense&quot; book fearing that she was going the way of most wonderful writers... leaving Historical Romance for bigger bucks.  I felt that her stories would lack the magic that brought to life such titles as The Secret and The Bride (both amazing books by the way)!  But I should have realized that Julie Garwood will always be Julie Garwood and whether she is writing about medieval Scottish Highlanders or a present day FBI Agent, her magic will shine through!<br />Nick Buchanan and Laurant Madden are an amazing couple in a tale as gripping as any movie I've seen.  I was guessing until the last pages ... which shouldn't have surprised me, since after all we are talking about Julie Garwood ... and was dumbfounded by the outcome.<br />If you love Julie Garwood and enjoy her stories don't be put off by the label of &quot;romantic suspense&quot;.

All of Julie Garwood's books are wonderful - some of her books are classics - this is one of them! What exactly made this book stand out from all of the others?  Easy I read it so fast I had to re-read the next day to  enjoy the parts I missed.  This book has everything: a friendship between  two women that was part of the story not just a passing paragraph.  I was  able to read about a true friendship instead of a jealous rivalry.  Most  books pit one woman against another, it was refreshing in itself to read  about Judith and Frances Catherine's relationship.  Not to mention the  friendships between the men.  In my opinion, this is just one of the  reasons that made this book special. Judith Hampton was a strong heroine,  independent yet vulnerable.  I loved her interaction with various  characters and how her love for Iain became a part of her.  But I have to  admit one of my absolute favorite things about Judith was her reaction  everytime she had to use her midwifing skills!  LOL! Iain Maitland.  Well,  what can you say about a gorgeous highlander with a heart!  He was  breathtaking, strong, capable but most of all he was tender.  The romance  was a beautiful thing to read and their interaction together was hilarious!   I laughed so much my sides hurt and I cried so much my head ached! The  secondary characters made this book come alive.  Brodick, Ramsey, Frances  Catherine and Patrick were all part of the fabric of this wonderful story!	2000-04-25

Turning this country bumpkin into a &quot;Lady&quot; that the Ton would approve of would be no easy feat.  In  walks Alexandra Beatrice Gallant and Lucien just about swallowed his  tongue!

Linda Lael Miller has such a diverse collection it is hard to put her into one category.  Her vampire series is (in my opinion) one of the best out there! Believe me - I do not like horror books but this story I promise you is all about romance!  This story was not your typical vampire romance, nor  was it your typical time-travel.  One of my favorite parts of this series  was how they were able to travel to various different time periods, I found  that fascinating.  Another thing about this book was that it actually made  me feel the Season.  It took place in Autumn and I truly felt that the  author described the time and weather perfectly - so much so that it has  stayed with me for quite some time! Neely Wallace was intelligent,  beautiful in more ways that her outer appearance and funny.  Very down to  earth - not at all what you would expect for the girlfriend of a vampire.   She was everything I want all heroines to be and then some! Aidan Tremayne  - Ooh la la... he is sexy, he is stunning and he is a vampire.  He is the  ultimate &quot;tortured&quot; hero and the desperation that he feels is  palpable!  The connection between the two characters is amazing to read and  the sacrifices he makes will bring tears to your eyes.  This man is not  evil - he is love everlasting! Maeve, Valerian, Dathan and all other  creatures of the night bring this series full circle.  (I told you I  enjoyed series - this is no exception!)  This story is so unique I can  hardly explain it - it is not a &quot;vampire&quot; story that you would  expect - it is a love story in the truest sense of the word!<br />READ IT!	2000-04-25

Jennifer Roberson is a wonderful author.  I found her work when a friend recommended Lady of the Forest (a tale of Robin Hood told from a woman's point of view) and I was lucky enough to find this book.  Ms. Roberson's  attention to detail is amazing and I enjoy her work very much. This is the  story of the 1692 Massacre of Glencoe (with a romantic spin).  It takes  place when the h/h are children and although they are enemies somehow find  something to like in each other.  They knew from the start that they would  always be much more than friends.  The description of Scotland, the details  of the political intrigue, the horrors of massacre are so unbelievable --  more so because they happened in truth -- I couldn't put the book down.  Until this book I didn't know what spellbinding meant... after you read it  you will understand why! Catriona Campbell is a likeable child and an even  more lovable adult.  She is the picture of a highland lass if ever your  imagination needed to create one!  The love she feels for Dair from the  minute they meet (even though they were enemies) makes you realize why you  could never pick the person you truly love - Love picks that person for  you.  She is smart, she is strong and she is real!  Cat reminds you of  someone you have always admired and you feel as if you've known her  forever.  You will feel pride in her and you will be devastated right along  side of her.  This heroine brings you into the story - as if you didn't  have a choice.  By the end of the book you realize the choice was made upon  opening the book! Alasdair ``Dair'' Og MacDonald.  He is not your  &quot;typical&quot; hero, from his looks to his personality - he is just  unique!  Gorgeous, smart and funny.  A family man, a devoted husband and a  loving son make this man special in anyone's eyes.  You will come to love  him and root for him and want to cry for him when the Massacre hits.  The  depth of emotion that this character brings out will surprise you and grab  hold of you like never before. The secondary characters are so wonderful  that you will find yourself in tears more times than once.  The attention  to detail and historical fact will have you looking up Glencoe on the  Internet and researching the Massacre in the library.  I was lucky enough  to visit Glencoe and although I was disappointed because there was not much  to &quot;see&quot; by way of historical treasures... that is the point -  there was nothing left!  Captivating and electrifying!  Vivid and lush  views of Scotland - if you want to know why people love to read about  Highlanders this book will explain it!	2000-04-25

Well it turns out that Kim Bennet is also Karen Hawkins, a wonderful woman who writes excellent stories!<br />The  Abduction of Julia is an incredible story between two opposites that share  the same heart.  Julia is the perfect heroine because she is someone you  can relate to - she is actually a real woman.  She is not some perfect,  cardboard cut-out beauty - she is a gorgeous woman hidden behind what  people perceive her to be.  When she removes the old clothes and glasses  she emerges as a beautiful lady - with the same personality as before - A  REFORMER!<br />Alec on the other hand is the perfect rake!  He is absolutely  stunning and Julia has been in love with him since she set foot in London.   He needs to marry immediately and due to circumstances beyond his control,  dowdy Julia Frant (the Frant Dragon) is his only option. If he wants to  keep the fortune away from his cousin Nick left by his grandfather he must  marry and live scandal-free for one year! The choice is clear - he will  marry Julia.<br />Little does he know his life has just changed for the  better. Little does he know the fortune is not the prize. Little does he  know he has just lost his heart!<br />Read it!  I highly recommend it!	2000-04-25

She can make any situation funny and usually does.  At a time in my life when I really needed some laughter, this book was recommended to me and it lifted my spirits more than I can say.  You can pick up any Jill Barnett book and  absolutely love it - but I think this is the best of the lot! This is a  story of a bumbling witch and an English Duke.  She fell into his arms and  he fell into her heart.  Hilarious doesn't cover it.  When Alec finds out  his beauty is a witch all hell breaks loose!   Joyous Fiona MacQuarrie was  the type of heroine that you just root for.  You want her to win, you want  her to have everything she ever dreamt of... but you don't ever pity her -  she doesn't give you the chance, you're too busy laughing at all of the  things she does!  Beauty is only part of her charm, actually you forget  what she looks like most of the time because of her bumbling and fumbling!   When she tries to cast a spell, watch out!  ROTFL! Alec Castlemaine, Duke  of Belmore.  He is the perfect Duke.  He is gorgeous, he has class and he  never ever smiles - until a certain beauty storms into his life (actually  falls into it)!  Control-freak is the only way to describe Alec and  unfortunately for him Joy is uncontrollable!  Watch him transform from the  stern and noble Duke to the sweet and gentle husband!  He is the perfect  straight man to Joy's antics.  You can't help falling in love with him.  I  would have to say that he is one of my very favorite dukes. Beezle (Joy's  weasel) is hysterical!  The rose petals when they make love is a beautiful  touch.  Richard and Neil are the perfect friends for Alec (and great  secondary characters) and Stephen is wonderful!	2000-04-25

Raine Merrick (Rafe) and Favor McClairen are two people that could have loved each other from the day they were born... that is how perfectly matched they were in spirit and in life.  Unfortunately she grew up hating  him and he just grew up hating.  The only change I would have made was to  mention Ash a little more, he was missed in this book.  It does go to show  that this is not your typical loving family (no Cynster's or Malory's  here...).  The family history in this book is filled with so much anger and  murder you have to remind yourself that you are reading a romance!   However, this is a beautiful love story filled with unexpected twists and  surprising humor not to mention my favorite villain, Carr!  I finished it  over the course of a day and that unforunately is the biggest problem with  this particular storyline.  Now I have to wait forever for Thomas and Fia's  story!	2000-01-18

Not only can she write a story that has both humor and wit but she can create a touching scene in just a few words.  Pulling on your heartstrings in one paragraph and then making you  cry with laughter in another!  The friendship between Simon and Daphne was  wonderful to read and the attraction from the word go was exciting to watch  explode.  I also think I know who the mysterious Author is but I don't want  to spoil it for anyone!  I can't wait to read Anthony's story ... it is  sure to be a fabulous read!<br />If you enjoyed this book keep your eyes  peeled for Julia Quinn's earlier books Splendid, Dancing At Midnight (which  are soon to be re-released) and Minx!

I had to force myself to slow down to read this book and still ended up reading it a second time.  It was that wonderful!  My favorite book of the series is still Devil's Bride but I must admit that A Rogue's Proposal just  moved into second place.  The relationship between Demon and Flick was a  joy to read, I got to know them as they got to know each other.  From  friendship to intimacy to the pre-engagement under the watchful eye of the  &quot;Ton&quot; was not only fun to read but also unique in itself.   <br />That is one of the features of Stephanie Laurens' books that I love.   She is truly unique in her writing and keeps surprising me with plot and  characterization!  I can't wait for the rest of the series and I look  forward to the twins' stories and Chillingworth's story, if they're  anything like the Bar Cynster, they'll be winners for sure!<br />I highly  recommend Stephanie Laurens' older Regency titles (if you could find them),  they are absolutely worth the search.	1999-10-13

I started reading this book this morning on my way to work (I am a LIRR commuter) and I could not put the book down.  Thankfully since I was able to finish my work in record time I was able to finish Everything and the  Moon before lunch!  I couldn't stop, I tried to slow down my reading (I  tend to read really fast, only leaving myself to re-read the book after  I've finished to learn of the things I might of missed) I even tried  closing the book and waiting until my trip home, but I just couldn't.  I  loved Robert and I loved Torie (not to mention that I happen to love that  nickname for a woman) and I especially loved the mention of the Duke of  Ashbourne, which only served to remind me of Splendid (another one of Ms.  Quinn's treasures)!  This book, along with all of her other books, are  delightful! Filled with love and laughter, wit and charm.  If you do not  read anything for the rest of this century, read her books.  SPLENDID,  DANCING AT MIDNIGHT and MINX, then EVERYTHING AND THE MOON and BRIGHTER  THAN THE SUN, and finally TO CATCH AN HEIRESS and HOW TO MARRY A MARQUIS!  You won't be sorry!	1999-07-06

This was the very first historical romance book that I read and because of it I have gone on to search, find and read every other book written by Iris Johansen (not to mention  about 500 other historical romance novels).  She  is unmatched in the field of romance.  Her mystery thrillers are also  wonderful but I must admit I am partial to her romance novels and hope one  day she will return to the genre.  This book is beyond compare and anyone  who disagrees should re-read it!<br />Both her historical romances and her  Loveswept collection are excellent.

I laughed (especially at the way  Judith reacted each time she had to act as midwife) throughout the entire  book!  I only hope that there will be more stories to come from this one.
