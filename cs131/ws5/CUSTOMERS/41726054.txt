With a mix of western culture, astrology, science and magick, you get an eye opening experience of pure ecstasy. <br />This certainly is not a step by step how-to, new age astrology guide. This is a complete book of revelations in the field of astrology that practitioners of the science itself need to experience. Leave behind all you thought you knew. Open the first page and read the introduction by Robert Anton Wilson. Then read the first page from Charles Kipp. You won't be able to put down this book once you start. <br />Master in his own right, Robert Anton Wilson introduces the book with his own personal experience while studying Crowley. You can see how Wilson has remained objective and open minded in his 28 years of reading and researching a man who, to this day, remains an enigmatic icon. His respect for Crowley shows clearly through the lines as he tries to explain not only who Crowley was, but why he lived his life the way he did. Although no one will ever know for sure Crowley's mindset, Wilson gives an award winning performance in presenting a fresh, very believable point of view.<br />Following this marvelous introduction isn't easy, but Charles Kipp is equal to the task as he takes you on an enlightened journey through astrology in a way you have never traveled before. Using Aleister Crowley as a test subject for his topic is, in a word, brilliant! Kipp calls on 30 years experience as student, practitioner and teacher of astrology to delve deeply into Crowley's life through his own writings. Intertwining them with Astrology not only makes for easy comprehension but sheer enjoyment! <br />Never before has such an in-depth book been written to keep the reader aware of each step; it's like taking several courses simultaneously. Kipp expands your horizons with the experience and proves that he really is the new master on the block!	2002-02-19

After all, our ancestors didn't have traffic lights, computers or electricity. So are we to believe magick cannot be worked within these areas? No, not at all. Being of Magick is not a stage act. It's who and what we are, it's our spiritual selves. So what do we do? The answer comes from a very beautiful and talented woman, Dorothy Morrison, in the book, Everyday Magic.<br />Now you can incorporate Everyday Magick into your modern life. Learn how to bring the spiritual teachings of the past to the today's technologies. Learn to infuse and intertwine them. Need that ever-elusive parking place...or need a protection for your computer? Maybe you need to get to that meeting in a hurry, so the traffic lights need to change. Can't find your car keys, need an easier childbirth, need a good judgement in court? These are tasks that can overwhelm us in today's fast-paced world.<br />Now, with Everyday Magick, these small but frustrating instances can all be consigned to the past. Learn how to bring together the past with the present to insure a fulfilled and tranquil future. Another highly recommended book.<br />M.L.
