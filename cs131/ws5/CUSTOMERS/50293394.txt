Bolognese cuisine, is well known throughout Italy to be some of the country's best, and Ms. Paganini kindly shares with us the recipes she learned at the hands of both her grandmothers and mother while growing up in Bologna as a child.<br />The chapters are well thought, and would appeal to anyone, including such titles as &quot;Making Biscotti For The Holidays&quot;, Christmas At Nonna Luisa's&quot;, and &quot;Perfect Pizza&quot; to name just a few. Each chapter combines family stories, as well as traditional recipes that are extremely easy to follow.<br />I have always had an interest in the tradition of one generation passing down their recipes to the next that one sees so often in Italy. Ms. Paganini intimately shares her experiences in this area with us, as almost every recipe in the book, is rich with her family's history.<br />Although I found it disappointing that this book contained no photographs or illustrations, which would only have enhanced my opinion of this book, I was pleased that the majority of recipes called for every day ingredients. 	2002-03-19

The authors have shared their love of Italian food, both through recipes used in their many Los Angeles restaurants, as well as the many stories and culinary tidbits interspersed throughout the book. This book expresses the belief that dining Italian style is much more than extraordinary food, but is in fact more about the combination of grace, generosity, and simplicity with which the food is offered. It shares the importance of taking time to savor meals with family and friends, enjoying simply prepared foods made with the freshest seasonal ingredients. It is their belief, that you can live an Italian culinary life anywhere, by following these simple principles.<br />The book begins with a brief overview on the absolute essentials for an Italian kitchen, including olive oil, parmesan cheese and wine. The following chapters are broken up into the usual chapters found in an Italian cookbook, with everything from Antipasti to Desserts. The Antipasti chapter contains an extensive selection of recipes including recipes for olives, bruschetta, focaccia, vegetable tapenades, and many more. There is also a very nice selection of assorted salads to be used as an appetizer or a light lunch. I particularly enjoyed the Fresh Mushroom, Arugula, and Parmesan Cheese salad, which is a wonderful start to any meal.<br />The First Course, or Primi chapter is divided into Dried Pasta, Fresh Pasta, Risotto, Soups, Gnocchi and Polenta. Almost all of these recipes are easy to prepare with easy to find ingredients. Also included are recipes for basic broths, simple sauces, and instructions for making fresh pasta.<br />The Main Course or Secondi chapter is complete with seafood and many assorted meat selections. The Venetian-Style Mussels and Potatoes was delicious, and very easy to prepare. I have also made the recipe for Pan-Roasted Chicken with Sweet Peppers, Olives And Capers a number of times, and it is quickly becoming a family favorite in my house. Compared to earlier chapters, I found the Contorni, or Vegetable Side Dish chapter to be a bit too brief, but the recipes shared here do cover all the basics.<br />The book concludes with the chapter on Dolci or Desserts, sharing a few tasty recipes, mostly fruit based, as well as a few recipes for traditional cookies. An explanation is given on the Italian outlook about desserts, compared to other cultures. Whereas many in America look at luscious desserts as the highlight of their meal, Italians usually consider fresh seasonal fruit to be the perfect complement to end a fine meal. Although I did enjoy reading this book, as well as trying many of the recipes, I would have preferred this book if it had contained some photographs of some of the tasty recipes. Apart from that, this book is a good choice for anyone who wants to understand what Italian cuisine is all about. One learns from this book that eating Italian style is as much about lifestyle as it is the basic food. 	2001-06-07

When it comes to Italian cooking, Biba Caggiano ranks right up there with the best of the best. Biba is the author of such previous books as Biba's Italian Kitchen, Italy al Dente, Northern Italian Cooking, Modern Italian Cooking, and one of my favorites, Trattoria Cooking. In this newest book, Biba has once again written a book that will delight anyone interested in Italian Cuisine. In Biba's Taste Of Italy, Biba returns to her roots, sharing recipes and stories of her beloved Emilia-Romagna. This region is well known for creating some of Italy's best recipes, including rich, meaty sauces, delicate stuffed pastas, bread thickened soups, succulent seafood and many more. The book offers more than 250 assorted recipes from antipasti to dessert.<br />Emilia-Romagna is famous for such ingredients as balsamic vinegar from Modena, prosciutto di Parma, mortadella, and of course Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. These important regional ingredients are discussed in an early chapter, and then can be found used in recipes throughout the book. The chapters are divided into the usual cookbook categories such as Antipasti, Soups, Seafood etc., but each chapter begins with an introduction of the recipes and ingredients specific to the region. For example, in Antipasti, Biba describes the popularity of serving a platter of cured meats, or affettati, including such meats as prosciutto, mortadella, coppa, and salame to name a few.<br />The recipes in this book have a home style simplicity, using popular, easy to find ingredients. Many of these recipes are family favorites from Biba's childhood spent in Bologna, while others were collected while visiting small, country tratorie, and family style restaurants. Novice cooks to experienced chefs will enjoy this book, as there are simple recipes consisting of a few ingredients which can be put together in minutes, to more complex, recipes such as the recipe for Minestrone Of Modena which lists over 21 ingredients. Interspersed throughout therecipes, are short paragraphs containing cooking tips, regional facts, and helpful hints.<br />Since this book has only been recently released, I haven't had the chance to make many of the recipes yet, but the ones I have made were wonderful. The Gratineed Asparagus And Prosciutto couldn't be simpler, yet is perfect as an antipasto or as a vegetable side dish. Biba's Maltagliati con Fagioli, or Pasta And Bean Soup was very tasty, and was even better reheated the next day. The dessert chapter, contains everything from cakes, tarts, biscotti, ice cream and fruit dishes. One of my favorite dessert recipes I tried, was Emma's Pastry Ring, or Ciambella, which was very similar to a family recipe I make every Easter.<br />This book will go on the shelf with my favorite cookbooks, and I am looking forward to seeing Biba's next book! As someonme who owns more than 150 Italian cookbooks, and shares their own passion for Italian food on my website Italian Food Forever, I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in Italian regional cuisine, particularly from Emilia-Romagna.	2001-04-12

Just thinking about the Red Chile-crusted Salmon Steaks with Smoked Yellow Pepper Sauce makes me want to run for the kichen, while the Chipotle Pork Tenderloin with Green Apple Sauce is a recipe I have made over and over again for company. Bobbie's tamale recipes have made my family life long fans of the Mexican tamale, although many of his tamale recipes have a contemporary twist to them. Many recipes call for a basic recipe that is topped with a glaze, salsa or sauce, and although it may seem like a lot of work, even a beginner cook could easily follow these recipes and get stellar reviews from family and friends. If you like bold, spicy flavors, you'll LOVE this book!	2000-11-14

As the Italian Food Host @ BellaOnline, I spend a lot of time in the kitchen and truly appreciate good food, whether it be international or American. Most of the recipes in this book that I have tried, I have enjoyed, although since almost every recipe prepares enough for 8 servings, I had to divide the recipes in half. I thoroughly enjoyed the Jerked Chicken with Mango-Cilantro Relish and Barbequed Red Onions, but felt the Barbequed Chicken Quesadillas with Grilled Tomato Salsa to be too much work for the final product. My recommendation would be that if you are already a fan of Bobbie Flays, buy this book because you will probably enjoy it. If you have never tried one of his recipes before, buy his first book Bold American Food instead.	2000-11-14

As the Italian Food host at BellaOnline, regional Italian cuisine is a special interest of mine. It is very evident as one reads through each chapter that Ms. Blasi has put a great deal of time into researching the southern regions of Italy, it's people and their cuisine. It is much more than a mere cookbook as great care has gone into describing each region which is encompassed in it's own chapter containing a brief bit of the region's history. <br />As each chapter unfolds, Ms. Blasi shares with us the traditional specialties of that region, with page after page of delicious recipes. I particularly enjoyed the recipes used to celebrate the major Italian holidays.<br />Although I found it disappointing that this book contained no photographs or illustrations, which would only have enhanced my opinion of this book, I was pleased that the majority of recipes called for every day ingredients. There are a number of game recipes, but on the whole, most recipes could easily be created by the average individual who shops at their local grocery or Italian specialty store.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in regional Italian cooking and it's history. However, it is probably not the best book for someone looking for a basic Italian cookbook.	2000-11-06

I was however a little surprised when it arrived and I saw just how small it actually was. After reading it through from cover to cover, I overcame my disappointment however, realizing that Mario had chosen only the best recipes for the holidays. As the Italian food host at BellaOnline, I am always on the lookout for Italian cookbooks that offer more than simply everyday recipes. Anyone buying this cookbook that is familiar with Mario Batali's work, will not be sorry. If you are interested in Italian recipes specific for the holidays, buy this book!	2000-11-01

For anyone who is educated in Italian cuisine, this book is a wonderful reference for his or her collection. Having lived in Italy for 8 years myself I was very interested in the traditional northern Italian recipes shared by the author. As the Italian Food host at BellaOnline, I am always on the lookout for a good new Italian cookbook for my collection that can teach me a little history about the recipes as this one does, as well as inspire me to create my own culinary treasures. It is well known that northern Italian chefs, particularly those from Emilia Romagna feel they are the absolute experts in stuffed pastas. I would recommend this book, but only if you have another basic Italian reference cookbook or two.	2000-11-01

Bugialli, an expert on Italian cuisine in general, shines on his own when it comes to pasta. As the Italian Food Host @ BellaOnline, I cannot begin to tell you how many times I have pulled this book off the shelf to use as a reference. If you love pasta, this book should be in your collection!	2000-11-01

It is evident that Susan Herrmann Loomis spent a great deal of time researching the recipes and culinary history while writing this book. As the Italian Food Host at BellaOnline and an avid cookbook collector of anything related to Italian cuisine, I would highly recommend this book for someone collecting Italian cookbooks. If it were your first Italian cookbook however I would encourage you to do more research. The one glaring negative of this book was that it did not have a single food photo. I can't imagine that in this day and age that publishers have not figured out that great food photos sell cookbooks!	2000-11-01

As the Italian Food Host @ BellaOnline, I keep primarily an Italian kitchen, and have over 130 Italian cookbooks in my collection. This book has great photos, interesting little articles throughout and VERY good recipes. I am partial to southern Italian cooking anyway, so this book with it's Sicilan and Napolitano influences was particularly appealing. I have made quite a few recipes from this book already and apart from the odd one or two, would repeat them all. If you like southern Italian cooking with it's bold flavors, you won't be disappointed with this book!	2000-10-04

It is obvious that Giuliano Hazan had a good teacher growing up as Marcella Hazan's son, yet he also has created a book that shows he has own culinary style with a contemporary flare perfect for today's busy families. One aspect I found particularly appealing about this book, was that all the ingredients called for could be easily found in most supermarkets. As the Italian Food Host at BellaOnline, I know too well the problems of trying to find specialty items called for in some Italian cookbooks that are rarely seen outside of Italy. Luckily you won't have that problem with this book!<br />Guiliano has taken the principle of all good Italian food, which is to use fresh, good ingredients prepared in simple methods to create recipes anyone could prepare. His recipes are perfect for both everyday family meals as well as elegant entertaining. This is a book worth having if you like simple, good Italian food. <br />The only thing I would change about this book is that I wish there were more photographs included. The ones that are included are very impressive, and more of the same would have increased the value of this book for me a good deal.	2000-10-04

I have had this book since just after it was published, and it remains my  authority on northern Italian cuisine. Lynne Rossetto Kasper has compiled  an amazing quantity of quality recipes from the Emilia-Romagna region. As  the Italian Food Host @ BellaOnline, and a collector of over 100 Italian  cookbooks I would highly recommend this book to anyone who appreciates  northern Italian cuisine. Ms. Rossetto adds a little comentary on each  recipe's history that is very interesting and her food photograph's are  stunning. My only complaint about this book is that there are not more of  these glorious photographs!	2000-08-04

This book has become one of my favorite Italian cookbooks. The photographs  are so glorious, you cannot browse through it without running to the  kitchen afterwards, inspired to create some tasty dish. As the Italian Food  Host @ BellaOnline, I am always looking for inspiration to create new  Italian recipes, and this book has lots! I have made over twenty of the  recipes so far for family and friends, and every one has been a big hit.  This book is well worth the money!	2000-08-04

As a collector of Italian cookbooks, I now count this one as one of my favorites. Michele Scicolone shares 250 wonderful recipes with very easy instructions, and adds a little extra note to each recipe. I hosted an  Italian Buffet last year for 50 people, and used this book as my primary  reference. The recipe for Frico (cheese wafers) and roasted Olives with  Fennel and Lemon are so tasty, I serve them now with drinks everytime I  entertain! This book offers a combination of both traditional Italian  recipes, and those more contemporary with sometimes surprising ingredients.  As the Italian Cooking Host @ Bella Online, and someone with over 150  Italian cookbooks in my collection, I would say this is definately a book  to buy! My only regret is that there weren't more pictures as the ones  included are so inspiring, it makes you want to run into the kitchen and  start cooking.	2000-01-22

If you love baking Italian, whether it be breads, tarts, cakes or cookies, then you'll love this book. As the Italian Online Cooking Host @ Bella Online, this book is my personal best reference when baking traditional  Italian breads and sweets. Carol Fieslds manages to teach traditional  Italian baking skills while still making it possible for even a novice to  create quality breads and sweets. I would advise anyone interested in both  baking and Italian cooking to add this one to their cookbook collection.	2000-01-22

Mario Batali's Simple Italian Food is one of my new personal favorites. As the online host for the website Italian Food Forever, and a great collector of cookbooks, this one is definately one I would recommend to anyone  interested in Italian food. Batali's book is not only full of amazing  recipes, it is fun to browse through with pictures and illustrations on  almost every page. His pasta recipes are almost all worthy of being used  while entertaining, and he adds just a few surprise ingredients here and  there without spoiling the traditional simplicity of the recipes. Well  worth the money!	2000-01-10

As the webmaster for my own Italian cuisine site Italian Food Forever, and a collector of over 130 Italian cookbooks, I think this one is a good choice. I found the recipes  easy to follow, and the finshed dish always lived up to it's description.  My only real complaints were that perhaps there were too many unusual  recipes that the average cook would have no use for such as Wild Boar,  or  Pheasant. I also would have liked to see more photographs. The ones  included were great, but in my opinion there weren't enough!	2000-01-10

Marcella does a wonderful job of presenting traditional Italian recipes in a straight forward manner anyone could follow. As the Italian Cooking Host @ Bella Online, I run out immediately to buy any book Marcella writes the  minute it hits the stores. I lived in Italy for 8 years myself, and her  recipes back back memories of the wonderful food experiences we had. My  only complaint that includes all of Marcella's books, is that she should  include pictures. Her recipes are all so great, the pictures would be truly  inspiring!	2000-01-10
