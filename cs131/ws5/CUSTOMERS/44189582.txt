It appropriately approaches a philosophical treatment of rock music in an 'analytic' prose style.  It is clear, direct, and it makes subtle category distinctions.  For example, it clarifies the distinctions between 'Rock and Roll,' 'Rock 'n Roll,' and 'Rock.'  It also clarifies the interpretative 'primary text' and ontological categories of rock music as the recording and recording process, as opposed to the song lyric, performance event, etc.  This book clarifies the distinctive aesthetic appeal of rock music as a cultural product without the high art/low art condescension.  I highly recommend it, especially to readers who are familiar with analytic philosophical aesthetics, writers such as: Cavell, Carroll, Kivy, Levinson, Walton, Scruton, Eaton, Hagberg, Danto, Wollheim, Higgins, Goodman, et. al.	2004-04-16

Although suited for an introductory course on poetry, I'm not sure why the publishers (Stanford UP) would think that this volume ... is a better deal than the other recent Stanford UP volume, The Collected Poetry, which includes some of Jeffers's prose (Prefaces/Letters) and is more comprehensive ...<br />This is a slim volume--about the size of Hass's previous collection (Rock and Hawk, now out-of-print).  But it is vastly superior in text and style to The Selected Poems (thin book, red and blue cover, ...).<br />I highly recommend this text.  It contains the \\"Best Of\\" Jeffers's poetic gems, such as \\"Shine, Perishing Republic,\\" (apropos for our current times), and \\"For Una,\\" to name a couple.<br />Jeffers was an amazing American poet.  For once I disagree with Vendler's estimation of his poetic merits and craft.  I would recommend Jeffers to a reader in the same spirit that Hass, C. Milosz, Wm. Everson, and Bukowski recommended that we listen to his prophetic voice.  Jeffers's work embodies the Carmel landscape and cosmic essence of Northern California.  Yet his voice is universal and resounds with tragic wisdom.<br />I also recommend Hass, Milosz, Everson, H. Miller, and the academic treatments of Jeffers's work by Robert Brophy.	2003-04-08

Human Wishes demonstrates that he is one of the most interesting poets on the scene today. His verse is vibrant and energetic. I highly recommend this collection of poems. Also, Hass has done much to introduce poetry to the general public. <br />Hass is a Northern California poet who has an eye for subtle movements in the natural world. Whether his setting is Tacoma, WA or Mt. Tamalpais, he always manages to capture images of life at its most fundamental source. For example, in \\"Spring Rain\\": \\"...the light will enlarge your days, your dreams at night will / be as strange as the jars of octopus you saw once in a fisherman's boat / under the summer moon....\\"<br />The strongest work here is the prose poems, such as \\"Museum\\" (describing a couple at a Kathe Kollwitz exhibit), \\"Human Wishes\\" (\\"This morning the sun rose over the garden wall and a rare blue sky leaped from east to west\\"), \\"Tall Windows,\\" and \\"The Harbor at Seattle.\\" <br />Also, the third section of this little book contains some gems, such as \\"Misery and Spendour,\\" \\"Santa Barbara Road,\\" and \\"Berkeley Eclogue.\\"<br />Hass loves word craft and the spirit that inhabits diverse poetic voices. His enthusiasm and zeal for the 'poetic' is much felt in this rich, little volume. In reading Hass, one feels as if the printed page could crawl or even perhaps fly away with the beautiful life that is found there.<br />I also recommend: C. Milosz, R. Jeffers, and A. Zagajewski.	2002-12-31

The latter poem was significant to me because of its recurrent instantiation as a concept.  As a lover of books, I love Collins's \\"Books\\": \\"From the heart of this dark, evacuated campus / I can hear the library humming in the night...I see all of us reading ourselves away from ourselves, / Straining in circles of light to find more light....\\" Also, \\"My Number\\" and \\"The Dead\\" are negotiations and whimsical meditations on Death.<br />Collins is a poet's poet.  He often talks about the arts of writing and teaching poetry.  Every poet and many readers will understand the intrinsic value of \\"The Best Cigarette,\\" \\"Monday Morning\\" with the pen-chewing student, and \\"Victoria's Secret.\\"  Anyone who's read Wordsworth a hundred times over will appreciate \\"Lines Composed 3,000 Miles From Tintern Abbey,\\" or those with a Dickinson bent, \\"Taking Off Emily Dickinson's Clothes.\\"  An \\"Afternoon with Irish Cows,\\" will perhaps remind you of a W.C. Williams or Sandburg.<br />Collins's verse is uniquely American.  It rings true as the best of Bukowski and is as insightfully simple as a WC Williams or Merwin.	2002-12-31

It would even serve as an excellent Intro. to Philosophy text.  My non-philosophy major friends have loved it.<br />This book is most successful in introducing philosophical inquiry and its themes in an interesting and exciting way.  It is a narrative of Magee's own entry into philosophy.  It begins with &quot;Scenes from Childhood,&quot; which establishes the immediacy and exigency of philosophical questions, then it moves into &quot;My Introduction to Academic Philosophy.&quot;<br />Magee discusses the various pendelum swings of philosophical fashion, from the rise and demise of linguistic analysis (he is a bit harsh on this topic), to basic philosophical problems, such as perception.  Some of the more interesting chapters are on Kant, Russell, Popper, and the nature of academic philosophy.<br />This is a remarkably engaging book.  It presents a very decent SUMMARY of contemporary philosophical concerns.  Many of my friends could hardly set it down.  It is written from an 'analytic' perspective (M. is an Oxford veteran).  The sentences are clear and direct, often witty.  It is stylistically amenable to a general public audience.	2002-12-31

His voice is uniquely Northern Irish, but his understanding of that which makes language and literature deep spans the world--its ages and cultures.  With a poet's vision, Heaney latches onto the resonance of words and images that explicate the human experience, in Icelandic sagas, Dante's verse, Milosz, or fellow Irish writers.<br />Heaney's aim in this collection of prose writings (some have been previously published and some are lectures) is to &quot;celebrate and take possession&quot; of poetry's excitement and exuberance.  Each piece is autobiographical, in that his approach is not strictly the performance of formal literary criticism, but is rather the creative sojourn a poet can take into the depths of his own craft, to call the poetic spirit home.  As he says, his central preoccupations are: How should a poet properly live and write?  What is his relationship to be to his own voice, his own place, his literary heritage and his contemporary world?<br />Heaney's leading article is &quot;Mossbawn,&quot; which describes the County Derry in the 1940's--as an 'omphalos' or navel which marks the center of the world--whereby one gets the sense that Heaney is a young Stephen Dedalus attempting to locate himself in Ireland, his community, and the world at large.  His sentences are rich and carefully worded to evoke just the proper provincial image.  He talks about his first forays in reading literature, rhymes, and the formidable Byron and Keats.<br />The next piece, &quot;from Feeling Into Words&quot; talks about the craft of writing poetry--his &quot;Digging&quot;--lines from Wordsworth.  The next articles in Section I are interesting and special--on T.S. Eliot, living in Belfast and No. Ireland, being an Irish student and writer who writes in an English language.<br />Section two engages various interests: English writers and poets, Yeats, No. Irishpoets and poetry, Kavanagh, P. Larkin, Dante and modern poetry, Z. Herbert, W.H. Auden, R. Lowell, S. Plath, Kinsella, E. Muir, Marlowe, John Clare, H. MacDiarmid, D. Thomas's &quot;Do Not Go Gentle...,&quot; E. Bishop, and R. Burns.<br />Section Three: S. Smith, Calvino's &quot;Mr. Palomar&quot; (an excellent book and review of it), Norman MacCaig, Ted Hughes, and C. Milosz (who writes marvelous verse).<br />This is a superb collection.  I also recommend Heaney's meditations on Frost.  He always attempts to uncover--to 'dig into'--features in poetry that make it 'good,' and in so doing, he immerses himself in a loved craft and discipline, to create vibrant, poetic prose.  One gets the feeling here that Heaney is showing-off his 'finders keepers' treasures--his favorites--his cherished agate marbles, which clink and rattle in a bag of sensuous word play.	2002-11-13

It is tightly argued and rigorous.  The key to understanding Langton's discussion is in the subtitle: &quot;Our Ignorance of Things in Themselves,&quot; which gives us a pretty clear indication that the traditional (Strawsonian) epistemological focus won't be explored in detail here.<br />I recommend reading Langton's article &quot;Intrinsic Properties&quot; (co-authored with David Lewis) prior to delving into this book.<br />Langton's thesis is that (a) 'humility' follows from (b) 'receptivity,' which is quite novel and refreshing.  A similar point is made by John McDowell in Mind and World (and Sellars in S and M).  If (a) follows from (b) then, as Langton argues, we can ignore K's args. on space, time, and the categories.  Actually, it seems to me that a deduction of  concepts would be on a parallel course with 'receptivity' talk in terms of transcendental presupposition.<br />The most interesting chapters are: Ch 2 [part 6 (humility), part 7 (receptivity)]; Ch 3: Substance and Phenomenal Substance; Ch 5: Kant's Rejection of Reducibility; Ch 8: Kant's 'Primary' Qualities; and most especially, Ch 9: The Observable and the Supersensible.<br />Langton (e.g., as Allison does) defends Kant's Transcendental Idealism on the grounds that the intrinsic properties of things are indeed unknown.  Her arguments are persuasive and convincing.  This book would be a good read along with Allison's K's TI (Yale UP), and the standard figures who tend to focus on epistemological concerns (Strawson, Bennett, Guyer, etc).<br />I also recommend the vast literature on Transcendental Arguments, esp. Stroud (1968) and (1999) in his Understanding Human Knowledge (Oxford UP); A. Brueckner on TA's (in Nous); see also R. Stern's two books on TA's (Oxford UP).	2002-11-12

Perhaps it is not as strong as Gen X or Shampoo Planet--or those Harolding moments in Portraits--but still a quite decent read.  Although at times, the plot is a bit slow.  Coupland accurately portrays characters whose cyber-world consists of computer games, coding, and geeky emails.<br />This is a must for those of us who deeply empathize with thematic elements in films such as Office Space or Trees Lounge.  I actually was acquainted with a real housemates couple in Berkeley who could be characters in this novel, who in their \\"free time\\" romantically played computer games with each other and otherwise spent vast amounts of time behind a computer screen.<br />I remember the world before Atari and the internet.  I recall anxious nuclear holocaust days prior to when \\"cyberspace\\" was a regular constituent in our mental vocabulary.  Perhaps technology does in fact ennoble our human values and aspirations, or perhaps it is a means of convenient evasion from self-knowledge.<br />Coupland explores some of these concerns in this novel with real-life characters who could mirror those folks in tech cultures (Irvine, Silicon Valley, Seattle, and/or Portland)--a culture that is both oddly familiar yet cubicled in silence--nameless shadows who input code and ship products for our servile consumption.	2002-10-07

Strawson has a metaphysical project that is at once inspired by Kantian issues (and insights) and independent of them, which is more elaborately developed in his Individuals.  Here, Strawson offers us an eloquent exposition and critical discussion of the CPR.  He is not altogether sympathetic with K's TI.  However, most Kant scholars agree that Bounds of Sense is not a defense of Kant's metaphysics--Strawson's Kant is not a Kant that a student should walk away with as the genuine article.  Nevertheless, Strawson provides us with elegant philosophical prose, while highlighting both areas: marks of Kant's genius and piteous incoherence (or obscurity).<br />Despite the fact that Strawson's attribution of inconsistency to K's TI isn't well argued or defensible, there is still much to learn here about good analytic philosophy (although not in terms of historical accuracy).<br />I also recommend: Guyer, Longuenesse, Allison, Langton, Stroud, Forster, McDowell's M and W, and A. Brueckner's UCLA dissertation on Kantian anti-skeptical strategies, as well as H. Ginsborg's Harvard dissertation on judgment.  Also see Stern on Transcendental Arguments (Oxford UP).<br />Part One in Bounds of Sense is the General Review, which is important reading, especially the conclusion with its most elegant (and longish) last paragraph.  This provides us with compelling reasons to take Kant seriously in our contemporary philosophical climate, despite Strawson's charge of the Second Analogy as a non sequitur of numbing grossness (a famous quote, p 28).  Strawson is correct to hail the insights of the Trans. Deduction, which he says &quot;are very great and novel gains in epistemology, so great and so novel that, nearly two hundred years after they were made, they have still not been fully absorbed into the philosophical consciousness&quot; (p. 28).  Outside of Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and Berkeley, Strawson is likely right in this characterization.<br />Part Two, Section 2 is useful reading.  Strawson's work in Section 3.2, 3.3, and 3.8 is also useful (on permanence, objectivity, and the refutation of idealism).  Part Four is important yet controversial (on K's TI).  Part Five is also most valuable; it is on K's geometry.<br />Although this is a problematic and controversial text (and overall interpretation of Kant), for all that, it is also valuable and often insightful.  I recommend this text in conjunction with reading Strawson's Individuals and K's Prolegomena (Cambridge or Hackett).	2002-10-06

I highly recommend it to anyone generally interested in medieval and Elizabethan accounts on purgatory, or to those who have an interest in Shakepeare studies.  Even for those who don't, this is an excellent book, and my interest in it grew with every turn of the page.  It is rich and well-written.<br />Chapter Two: &quot;Imagining Purgatory&quot; discusses various philosophical and medieval connections (via manuscripts) to Shakespeare's texts (also see the classic, &quot;The Medieval Heritage of Elizabethan Tragedy&quot;).  Chapter Three: &quot;The Flights of Memory&quot; (oddly enough, also see Derrida's The Gift of Death/U Chicago Press, Staten's Eros in Mourning, Derrida's The Work of Mourning, and E. Scarry's Body in Pain) is highly interesting material on the poetics of pain and suffering.  Chapter Five: &quot;Remember Me&quot; is brilliant (also see Derrida/Levinas on the 'adieu' issue--U of Chicago and Stanford UP titles).<br />Also see: Fish, How Milton Works (Harvard UP); Williams, Truth and Truthfulness (Princeton UP); Staten, Eros in Mourning (Johns Hopkins).  I also recommend Robert Bell's dissertation on the harrowing of hell (English/U of Maryland/CSULB Emeritus).	2002-10-05

Philosophy), or as a scholarly apparatus, this is a superb collection of articles.  It places the reader square in the middle of current discussion in Wittgenstein studies, and this anthology is a good entry into the threshold of that research.  With this, you enter into a world of pain [I just had to say that.  Somehow it is appropriate to juxtapose W. with quotes from the The Big Lebowski (a film)].<br />Wittgenstein is a difficult and at times obscure philosopher.  However, this anthology and Crary's New W. (Routledge) makes the best case for W's relevance to the philosophy of math and the philosophy of mind. <br />Some of the more important articles included here are: Stern, &quot;Availability of W's Philosophy,&quot; Cavell, &quot;Notes and Afterthoughts,&quot; Stroud, &quot;Mind, Meaning and Practice&quot; (excellent), Sluga (on W's subjectivism), Fogelin, Ricketts on W's Tractatus, and the following figures on math and math necessity: Diamond, Gerrard, and Glock.<br />I highly recommend this anthology.  I also recommend: Crary's New W; W. in America; McDowell's articles on rule-following; Stroud, Mind Meaning and Practice (Oxford UP); Dummett, Putnam, and Diamond's Realistic Spirit.

This is a careful and scholarly text.  Contrary to what one of the reviewers commented here, I think the book was an interesting and entertaining read.  I highly recommend this biography to anyone with even the slightest interest in Kant (or his contribution to Enlightenment Philosophy).  And it would make a great text for an Introduction to Kant course (just as Monk's bio on Wittgenstein is often used in intro courses).<br />We sometimes think of Kant as having lived a boring and dull life--that he was in fact as mundane and interesting a person as the schedule he kept (shop owners in the marketplace would often set their clocks to his daily walks).  But the picture of Kant that Kuehn provides us with here is radically different.  Sure, Kant lead a regular and ordered life, but Kuehn breathes accurate life into pedestrian images of Kant that we may have learned in school (or in textbooks).	2002-10-05

He is perhaps even the most important writer from Great Britain since Yeats.  It's nice to know that an Irishman who speaks for all citizens of the world has been most deservedly honored with a Nobel Prize.<br />Heaney is a word-smith.  For example, \\"The Forge\\" is a sonnet that embraces the scope of poetic creativity and power: \\"All I know is a door into the dark....\\"<br />Heaney's work is uncompromising and unparalleled in its depth.  It can be justly compared to Milosz, or even a Yeats.  Heaney is introspective, careful, and most importantly, sincere.  Every word on the page counts; every word reverberates and shimmers with life, death, and modest negotations with an often hostile political landscape.  His poetic vision is transcendental.<br />This anthology includes Heaney's Nobel Prize Speech: \\"Crediting Poetry,\\" which is incredibly beautiful and thought-provoking.  Some of my favorite poetic images are included here, involving blackberries, frogs, funerals, marital meditations, early morning military manuevers, potato peeling, and a mother ironing....<br />I highly recommend this anthology.  It is beautiful and exciting; Heaney's verse will raise the hair on the back of your neck, as well as electrify your soul.	2002-09-29

Countless  instructors haven't even heard of him, but that is a shame.  Some professors even skip the Jeffers section in American literature anthologies.  With the publication of this long-awaited anthology (in paperback), there is plenty of evidence here to suggest that Jeffers is a major figure of influence.<br />Jeffers had a transcendental vision.  He built a poet's niche in Carmel, where he commented on nature's cosmic cycles, its beauty and violence, which he saw as expressions of God's character.  Jeffers was a poet of the Carmel landscape--weather worn granite, tumultous surf, birds of prey, twisted coastal cypress--he also approached descriptions of humanity's arrogance and weakness in light of its fascination with war, violence, and self-inscribed bloodshed.  Jeffers espoused a poetic doctrine of Inhumanism, which was perhaps a reflection of his own personal misanthropy: humans are atoms to be split.<br />Some of my favorite poems are here: &quot;Shine, Perishing Republic,&quot; &quot;Boats in a Fog,&quot; &quot;Carmel Point,&quot; &quot;Divine Superfluous Beauty,&quot; &quot;Tower Beyond Tragedy,&quot; &quot;Bed by the Window,&quot; &quot;Una,&quot; &quot;The Deer Lay Down Their Bones,&quot; and even some of his last writing.  I remember a certain Shakespeare class in which I read &quot;Shine, Perishing Republic&quot; on the day after the LA riots.<br />Robert Hass (UC Berkeley), C. Milosz (Emeritus, UC Berkeley), and William Everson have been poet champions of Jeffers' work.  But one scholar, in particular, has dedicated his academic life to understanding that creative pulse, which inspired Jeffers to his pen.  That notable scholar is Robert J. Brophy.<br />I highly recommend this anthology. I also recommend the scholarship of Robert Brophy.  I can say with pleasure and esteem that I have benefited from his scholarship and literature courses atCal State U., Long Beach.  Bob Brophy introduced me to Jeffers (via a Jeffers course and a Tor House tour, 10/91); I have introduced Jeffers and his work to my own students, and I will forever be touched by his gentle, guiding hand.	2002-09-29

This anthology contains new material from some top-flight folks in the field.  <br />M and W is an important text; it engages, as very few  contemporary philosophy of mind texts have, the serious and neglected dualisms of conceptual scheme and empirical content; spontaneity and receptivity, which are, needless to say, Kantian concerns.  McDowell is a proponent of conceptual content (within the realm of a 'minimal empiricism') and appeals to Kant and Wittgenstein to buttress his descriptive approach to philosophical inquiry. M and W has some brillant and evocative insights (with more than a few expensive obscurities), and some of McDowell's metaphors are splendid indeed, such as the teetering 'seesaw' and the 'sideways on picture.'  Of course, it attempts to negotiate Kantian insights concerning human cognition with certain contemporary discussions on the Myth of the Given (Sellars), The Third Dogma (Davidson)and the Tribunal of Experience (Quine), and Rorty's attack on epistemology.  <br />This anthology could offer disenchanted graduate students a reason to complete doctoral studies in philosophy.  It is that rich and exciting.  I am seriously nervous with glee (nerd alert!).   <br />The most important and interesting articles here are: M. Friedman, \\"Exorcising the Philosophical Tradition\\" (previously published); R. Pippin, \\"Leaving Nature Behind\\" (on subjectivism); B. Stroud, \\"Sense Experience and the Grounding of Thought\\" (always a pleasure to read Barry); R. Brandom, \\"Non-Inferential Knowledge, Perceptual Experience...\\"; G.

Williams--a wise veteran philosopher--takes up the topic of truth. He approaches the notions of trust, authenticity, and sincerity, and by contrast, he engages the problems of lies, deception, and infelicity. There are numerous lessons to be learned in these pages, some of which the present reviewer notwithstanding most dutifully needs to assimilate into his own deliberative set.<br />I cannot stress enough how important this book is in our current social and academic milieu. It reaches into the thoracic cavity of philosophy and liberates its hardened, cold heart by messaging throbbing life into it.<br />Those persuaded by the respective New Age, Poststructuralism, Relativism bent are highly encouraged to read this book. If your nightstand reading is A Course on Miracles or anything pertaining to Ayn Rand, C. Castenada, S. Maclaine, Lacan, Adorno, Rorty, Derrida, K. Silverman, J. Butler, Krishnamurti, tantric sex, or the healing properties of desert rocks, you MUST read this book. If you believe sand fleas are space aliens and are responsible for the human population of Mother Gaia, order now. Hear Ye, Cultural Relativists and anthropology majors!<br />I also recommend: Nozick, Invariances; Searle, Social Construction; Krausz, Relativism; Nagel, Last Word; and the Williams corpus.<br />The fundamental point of discussion here is a tension between the pursuit of truthfulness and a certain skeptical doubt as to whether truth is to be had. This book embraces the nature and scope of philosophical inquiry with subtle, clear, and rigorous arguments.<br />Chapter One: Defines and spells out the philosophical problem. Chapter Two: A fictional account about how the problem of truth arises--its \\"genealogy.\\" Chapter Three: Discusses language, plain truths, and values. Chapter Four (most important): On truth, assertion, and beliefs. Chapter Five: Sincerity, Lying, and Styles of Deceit. ETC.<br />This book deserves my highest recommendation.	2002-09-10

Perhaps two??<br />There must have been a British school of philosophical prose--a cadre of gin-drinkers--(perhaps we could call it the Dummett School of Philosophical Prose) that cranked out folks who could write difficult sentences.  Peacocke (and I daresay Crispin Wright, and McDowell in some moods) earned top honors.  Must have been post-J.L. Austin, maybe post-Ryle.<br />Nevertheless, if you have the patience to find it, Peacocke has an interesting thesis here.  He engages what he calls the 'Integration Challenge,' (IC) which is basically the task of accounting for both the metaphysical and epistemic grounds of our truth statements.  Peacocke says that the notion is inspired from Benaceraff's paper on mathematical truth: \\"the concept of mathematical truth, as explicated, must fit into an over-all account of knowledge in a way that makes it intelligible how we have the mathematical knowledge that we have.\\"  So Peacocke wants to extend the IC for math truth to other philosophical areas.<br />Part One describes exactly what the IC is.  Part Two is on Truth--whereby Peacocke advances what he calls the 'linking thesis' of epist. and metaphyiscs.  Part Three is Dummett-like/Strawson-like: on the past, property identity, truth and realism.  Part Four (which is most interesting to me) is on necessity (modal and wittgenstein challenges).  Part Five is on self-knowledge.  Part Six continues the discussion in part five, and goes into Delta Theories and Reductionism.  Part Seven: Freedom.  Freedom!  Part Eight is concluding remarks, his nail in the coffin for his views.<br />This is some controversial stuff here.  Not easy going.  I also recommend some of the  classical literature on truth and math necessity:  Dummett, Stroud, Putnam, Horwich, Lewis's modal realism, McDowell, Davidson, Wright, Burge.	2002-09-10

This book provides us with a good discussion (and is often interesting) on this topic, which also has been recently discussed by McDowell, Peacocke, Heck, Putnam, Strawson, Stroud (Quest), S. Kelly, and McGinn, etc. One may also want to see Brewer's article in Boghossian, et. al., \\"New Essays...Apriori\\" (Oxford UP). <br />In P and R, Brewer provides more detailed arguments than McDowell does in his provacative M and W (often in agreement with him on conceptual content) and his prose style is much more clear (and correct) than Peacocke (who defends non-conceptual content). <br />Also, very much worth looking at is A. Brueckner's (UCSB) work on externalism (see Ludlow's anthology) (and Burge and Falvey/Owens). <br />I also recommend the recent dissertations and/or articles on this topic by S. D. Kelly (now at Princeton),Cheryl Chen (Brandeis), and Eddie Cushman (UCB veterans). <br />Brewer argues for: (C) \\"Perceptual experiences provide reasons for empirical beliefs,\\" which seems harmless enough, but he gets to this conclusion by means of two controversial premises: (1) \\"The most basic beliefs about the spatial world have their contents only in virtue of their standing in certain relations with perceptual experiences,\\" and (2) \\"Only reason-giving relations between perceptual experiences and beliefs could possibly serve the content-determining role required by (1).\\"<br />He has separate chapters that argue for (1) and (2)--Chapters 2, 3, and 5, but I think these respective arguments are a stretch. But definitely worth looking at.<br />The most interesting material here is his discussion on what he calls the \\"Strawson Argument\\" (Chapter 2.2, 3.1) and his coverage of externalism and a priori knowledge (chapter 8).<br />Overall, I recommend this text.

Overall, this is not the first book I'd recommend for someone wanting to learn Wittgenstein or how to write clear philosophical prose.  His prose is about one rung up from Peacocke.

Nozick situates truth in space-time and discusses objective facts (and the attractions of a correspondence theory of truth).  Chapter Two extends his discussion on objective facts; he brings in the philosophy of science.  Chapter Three discusses modality (necessity and contingency), and the most interesting material here is on mathematical and logical necessity (see Dummett, Putnam, and Stroud).  Chapter Four is on consciousness and the mind-body problem (compare with Searle, Chalmers, and McGinn).  Chapter Five is a discussion on normative ethics.<br />I highly recommend this book.

Allison is perhaps the ablest defender of Kant in the USA.  Burge once said that Allison defends Kant a bit too sympathetically--perhaps believes that K. is right.  I think Allison's defensive reading is crucial in understanding Kant's Transcendental Project, or the Critical Project.  If one wants a clear notion of what Kant meant by &quot;Transcendental Idealism,&quot; this text is required reading.  Allison's prose is careful, clear, and cautious.  He brings light to often obscure passages  of 'the Master.'<br />While I have the chance to plug it, I highly recommend Kuehn's biography on Kant (Cambridge UP), esp. for students new to the CPR.<br />Also, the N. Kemp Smith translation of K's CPR is standard in the field, but the new Guyer-Wood translation (Cambridge UP) is certainly worth checking out.  Many corrections.<br />For an 'empirical' reading of Kant, see Strawson's Bounds of Sense.  Also, his Individuals.<br />For excellent readings and clear interpretations of Kant, see Allison, Guyer (K and the Claims of Knowledge), Strawson (not altogether sympathetic with K's 'T.I.'), and Collins (Possible Experience/ U CAL).<br />On Kant and &quot;Transcendental Arguments,&quot; see Stroud's articles (Human Knowledge/Oxford UP), A.

The Guyer text is thorough and rigorous--a quite careful reading and interpretation of the Third Critique--I recommend it along with Allison's recent work. (Allison and Guyer sometimes disagree on important points....)  <br />Allison is an astute and keen defender of Kant (see his Transcendental Idealism/Yale UP).  This new book is aptly in line with his best scholarship and cautious reading.  I highly recommend it.<br />Allison's text is divided into four parts.  First, he deals with Kant's \\"Conception of Reflective Judgment,\\" whereby I recommend that you also review B. Longuenesse's book on judgment (Princeton UP).  Allison's interpretation here differs from L's, and he clearly states how his view is unique, as well as a more balanced comprehension of the conncetion between the reflective judgment of taste and the epistemic role of reflection.<br />I daresay, the second part of the book is the most important (Chs. 3-8); it deals with the quid facti/quid juris distinction in the domain of taste.  Chs. 6-8 are quite useful, especially ch. 8, which is on \\"the Deduction of Pure Judgments of Taste.\\"  An understanding of this material is crucial to a more certain grasp of K's Third Critique.<br />Part 3 deals with the connection between judgments of taste and moral judgments.  Ch. 10 discusses the mirror-like connection between 'duty' and pure 'aesthetic judgments.'<br />Part 4 discusses genius and K's notions on sublimity.  For specific coverage on this topic, see Crowther on the Kantian Sublime (Oxford UP) in conjunction with this chapter.	2002-08-19

This is an important text on the topic of how a TA may yield positive results in answering the (Cartesian) skeptic.  Stern's most valuable discussion is on how Stroud's pessimism (in &quot;TA's,&quot; 1968, reprinted in his Understanding Human Knowledge/OXFORD UP) is unjustified.  Stern is convincing in showing us that a certain modest TA can get around Stroud's dilemma (also see A. Brueckner's articles on TA's and modest TA's).  He is also convincing in showing us that there are more than one kind of (Kantian) TA strategy.<br />But at the end of the day, Stern's discussion of 'justification' is disappointing, and we have no reason to think that a TA will completely satisfy the skeptical challenge--the issue of 'justification.'  It could still be true that the 'I' or 'thinking thing' is a BIV.<br />However, this text is valuable in discussing Stroud's work.  And it is fairly staright on when it comes to his opening chapters on 'negative' solutions.<br />See A. Brueckner's review of this book in Phil Review, 2001.	2002-08-19

Searle has collected a large and important variety of articles in this text, which spans several years of thinking on issues such as: the nature of consciousness, free will, the mind-body problem, rationality, and collective action.  Only one article on Kripke's meaning skepticism has been not previously published.<br />The vigor and force of questions that Searle queries regarding how it is possible to reconcile our intuitions about having a 'free will' in a world of physical laws and (all things being equal) deterministic principles is important and fundamental.  I highly recommend this volume, which conveniently assembles previous articles, and it makes clear Searle's position on these problems.  Indeed, it makes clear exactly how difficult and challenging philosophical problems and questions are--and why philosophers stay awake at nights thinking about them...and why no easy solution is forthcoming in philosophy or science...<br />The articles are written in Searle's usual style--with problem solving on his mind--clearly stating the problem to be addressed and evaluated--a model of philosophical prose...<br />And I might add...the cover photograph of Searle is splendid--him in a tweed coat...autumn leaves...just in case you've wondered what a suave academic is supposed to look like nowdays...	2002-07-17

As with his work on truth, one cannot complain--has no room to complain--that Soames is not precise or thorough here.  So my review of the book can only be positive, if it is not an obvious expression of utter admiration.  The only criticism one could offer at the outset is that the read is a bit stylistically dry, which is a product of careful logical analysis, precision, and painstaking meditation on the several issues covered in it.<br />Prior to reading this text, I recommend another whirl in Kripke's NN (and yet another...) as well as the first half of Salmon's Reference and Essence (Frege's Puzzle/[Ridgeview] would also be beneficial).<br />Soames' subtitle to Beyond Rigidity (a clever title) is: 'The Unfinished Semantic Agenda of NN' so one would expect some beaucoup direct reference theory and a clear analysis of just what kind of 'agenda' kripke left 'unfinished.'  Soames is meticulous in satisfying that expectation.<br />Ch 1 discusses two main points of the unfinished semantic agenda: a positive theory of meaning (semantic content, names), and the significance of natural kind terms.  Ch 2 is a discussion of proper names as RD's (as not R. descriptions). Ch 3 discusses the meaning of names as their referents.  Ch 4 analyzes ambiguity and proper names (esp. indexicals).  Ch 5 evaluates 'partially descriptive names.'  Ch 6-8 deals with pro attitudes ascriptions (defending a Millian/neo-Russellian view of names and indexicals in light of Fregean informational content).  The last chapters deal with natural kind terms.<br />At bottom, it seems that Soames is still committed to an anti-descriptivist account of proper names (which is probably the mainline view nowdays--Searle may be one of the few hold outs).<br />Soames makes K's project more explicit (and maybe more clear), and an interesting thesis he develops is that natural kind terms are not RD's (nor are they incredibly crucial for an understanding of proper names)<br />This text will be worthy of reading and re-reading again.	2002-06-12

This book is an excellent primer on the topic of what McGinn calls logical properties.  He has organized chapters on identity, existence, predication, necessity, and truth.  I highly recommend this text as well as others: Kripke: Naming and Necessity; Quine: Philosophy of Logic, Methods of Logic; Forbes: Metaphysics of Modality; Salmon: Reference and Essence, Frege's Puzzle.  <br />This text is a decent overview of these topics, eps. on Frege, Russell, and Kripke.  The most interesting chs. are on necessity and existence (Soames is the authority on truth).  <br />McGinn argues in favor of existence in terms of a first-order predicate (as opposed to quantificational paraphrase) and rejects identity in strictly quantifiable terms (via Leibniz's law).  He sees identity as a primitive relation expressed by a 2-place predicate, which is his take off stance on necessity (possible worlds).  At bottom, McGinn rejects a philosopher's 'infatuation' with expressions of modality as strictly quantificational.  One may find interest in his arguments for such a rejection.	2002-06-12

I admire Cross's journalism skills--every once and awhile he writes an elegant sentence--but the biography reads like a telescopic view of how a troubled teen becomes a suicide victim.  At times, it seems as if Cross attempts to paste together episodes in Cobain's childood (the divorce, the alienation, troubles with Dad, troubles with the step-parents, seeing a hanged man on the way to school, drug use...) as a kind of psychological explanation for his later motivations to end what is assumed to be a troubled and unfortunate life.<br />The value of Cross's book is not in its telling of Cobain's childhood experiences or the patchwork of psychological issues he supposedly suffered from (via diary entries)...the book works well when it focuses on the music that Kurt was about...the recording sessions--the live performances--even unto the last days.<br />Some of us need an explanation for Cobain's death, but what we need to remember is his love of art and his passion for the beautiful music he created...the motives and philosophy that underscores that music...how it captured the feelings and mood of a so-called X-Generation--in a socio-political environment of mediocrity and lies...<br />Kurt helped make that time liveable and endurable...and Cross's book is best when it exemplifies that fact.<br />Also check out Azzerad: Come As We Are.	2002-06-12

Nussbaum's Upheavals of Thought is a discussion of how emotions and moral psychology connect.  Some recent work has been done in this area by others in the field, such as Wollheim, Neu, and Goldie. OK, so her recent work is not hard-core analytic philosophy.  But it is informed by a breadth of research on various theories of emotion, and it does engage various philosophical treatments of the emotions.<br />The most interesting material in this book is in Part Three. Nussbaum explicates various texts to illustrate how they contain specific moral concepts central to human experience and action, such that the emotions are treated in an overlapping literary and philosophical manner.  This section is not particularly philosophical, however that is taken to be, but is rather careful music and literary criticism.  This is a bold move on Nussbaum's part.  Her readings on Mahler, Bronte, Joyce, Dante, Augustine, etc. are valuable because she offers sensitive readings of literary texts that do not fall into the usual discourse one finds in or from literature depts.  And why would we expect literary criticism in an Anglo-American philosophy dept.??  But Nussbaum's criticism and careful readings demonstrate how literary texts can be morally relevant and philosophical--in ways that are appealing to philosophers and literary folks at the same time.  In a way, Upheavals of Thought is a continuation of her work in Love's Knowledge, Therapy of Desire, and the Fragility of Goodness.<br />So one could nearly always claim that a text which is similar to this one is &quot;hot air&quot; or &quot;misguided psychology,&quot; but that sort of view undermines further critical thinking.  It is simply too easy to take such a position.  <br />Nussbaum's Upheaval is a subtle text.  It is deeply evocative and insightful.  Yes, problematic claims are made.  Logical rigor is often absent.  However, it is nice once and a while to hear from a genuine philosophical scholar on current issues in eloquent and sophisticated prose.  Is it philosophy?  I'm sure that question misses the point--at least Nussbaum's point in this text, which are actually several points.  Her point seems more to take into account how literature, music, and diverse human contexts can be treated philosophically, which, it seems to me, valuable to those readers both in literature and philosophy.	2001-11-24

McDowell is certainly one of the most important, careful, and creative minds in the field.  Mind and World is crucial reading material on perceptual content, judgment, and experience.<br />Inspired by Sellars's Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind, McDowell interrogates the notion of a 'logical space of reasons' as having location in the natural world.  At times adopting an obscure and abstract prose style, McDowell nevertheless identifies specific anxieties concerning the realtion between mind and world: tensions between a Kantian sensible intuition (or 'minimal empiricism')--how our thoughts are answerable to and directed at the world--and the idea of receiving an impression (or Kantian humility) as a transaction with the world, placing it in a 'logical space of reasons.'  So there is a tension between a normative context, that is, how the world 'impinges' on us, which is within the logical space of reasons, and empirical concepts that are supposed to be within the logical space of nature.  But if we take Sellars seriously, identifying something as an impression--an economy of logical space of nature 'giving' or 'impinging' on the mind, then we are responsible to characterize just how an 'impinging world' is different from justifying or placing a verdict on empirical descriptions.  McDowell's tension is between a 'minimal empiricism'--thought is answerable to a tribunal of experience--and how experience is indeed a tribunal, which attributes verdicts on thoughts.<br />Along the way, McDowell critiques the Myth of the Given, Davidson's coherentism, and argues for 'direct realism.'<BR>McDowell has a flair for characterizing and 'exorcising' philosophical anxieties between empiricism and naturalism, and he employs creative metaphors that are extremely helpful, such as the 'seesaw' and a 'sideways on view.'<br />The first three lectures are most important, whereinhe discusses conceptual and non-conceptual content.  Here he engages the views of Sellars, Quine, Davidson, Evans, and Peacocke.<br />Mind and World is a masterful example of careful and thorough-going philosophy--at its best.	2001-11-19

Back to the proverbial rationality and free will drawing board. I recommend a slew of preliminary texts as an overview of the field, such as Williams, Scheffler, Korsgaard, Scanlon, Velleman, Nozick, etc. <br />Nevertheless, Searle writes with his usual clear, direct, and economic prose. He enters a crowded practical reason debate with, again, his usual bravado. He argues against Williams's externalist view by describing substantial tautological errors. But this approach tends to oversimplify Williams's complex view. One wonders if Searle's reading of Williams is actually right (or careful enough). I prefer Scanlon's handling of W's externalism in the Appendix to What We Owe to Each Other, and McDowell's well-known article on the subject. <br />The strength of Searle's book is his defense of an internalist view of rationality and action, which resurrects his views on intentionality and speech acts. He thoroughly demonstrates in one chapter how a Deductive Model in rationality (i.e., a practical syllogism ala Kenny) cannot work. He also clearly identifies the major problems in practical reason, conflicting reasons, and defends a novel approach, what he calls a semantic categorical imperative. This is a controversial view, which navigates between (or circumvents) Humean and Kantian theories on moral motivation.<br />Another stregth of the book is how Searle connects rationality in action (hence the title of the book) and his theory of intentionality to the free will problem. In the last chapters, he clearly identifies just what the nature of the free will problem is, which is pretty much a rehashing of his chapter in Minds, Brains, and Science (Harvard UP). The reader gets a clear picture of how and why the free will issue is a major contemporary philosophical problem, requiring a correct scientific research project to help solve the problem. One also gets a clear view of a top-notch philosopher at work on this serious problem. It is obvious why this problem has kept Searle awake at nights--why he misses the freeway on-ramp during his drive to work. It is a seemingly insoluable problem, and Searle makes the nature of the problem and the reasons that it keeps philosophers awake at night explicit. <br />So the book closes, basically, with a challenge for philosophers to continue work on free will and rationality. It is also a challenge for scientists in the labs to work on a research program that would identify the whole problem and its potential solution.	2001-11-17

No nonsense. His methodological approach to philosophical inquiry is &quot;descriptive&quot; and quietist.  He addresses several concerns in metaphysics: color perception, realism, reductionism, and subjectivism.  The main strength of Quest is Stroud's rigorous identification of subjectivism as a serious philosophical problem. If you read one philosophy book written in the last five years, I would put this one at the top of the list. If you get no further in your reading than the Preface and Introduction (which would be a shame), that alone would delight and serve you well.	2001-11-17

This is a collection of Stroud's major articles on Wittgenstein, Quine, and theories of meaning.  The more important articles here engage various interpretations of Wittgenstein, notably Dummett on necessity and Pears's False Prison.  This text is a &quot;must have&quot; for any serious student of analytic philosophy, especially for those who are interested in Wittgenstein.  Also, it contains a superb article that critiques Searle's theory of intentionality (i.e., the role of the Background in that theory).	2001-11-17
