There were a lot of great character moments and it was interesting to see characters who weren't usually together interact. Buffy and Gunn's pissing contest was especially amusing. I also loved all the shout outs to Doyle. However, the second half of the book gets bogged down in the plot and it drags a lot. There were also a few major printing mistakes. One page is omitted entirely and another is printed twice. Still, the book does bring nearly the entire casts of Buffy and Angel together in a coherent and believable manner which isn't an easy feat. If you are looking for a good crossover book then you may want to give this one a try.	2004-06-11

This is partly because of the love triangle that is introduced and partly because this is where the series hits it's stride. This installment, more than any other, has the perfect blend of romance and plot. This is one of my favorites in the series and after four or five rereads it's still highly enjoyable.	2004-06-11

Usually the mystery genre isn't really my thing but this book is an exception. The mystery itself wasn't really anything special but the heroine is the most interesting character I've come across in a long time. I can't really say anything more about her without giving too much away. Fans of Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire series should give this series a try.	2004-06-11

I was beginning to doubt that such a thing existed. All of the characters were well written and I didn't even have to roll my eyes once while reading it.

You don't really need to play the games to understand the manga but it will help keep you interested. This volume covers some of Chris and Hugo's back story and some of the events that take place early in the game. I could have done without a lot of Hugo's story but Chris' was pretty interesting. The art is pleasant but not overly stunning. Also, Geddoe fans will be disappointed because he's hardly in this volume. Other than that, this manga does a good job of staying true to the game and I'll be reading future volumes.	2004-06-11

This read through reminded me how much I use to like Richard. It made me feel all nostalgic. Sadly, Richard and the wolves get on my nerves in a big way now but I'll always have the memories. I really liked the mystery(s) in this one and it was great to read about Anita interacting with her cop buddies again.

It's not a bad book at all but I just don't like it as much as the others. The fairy sub plot didn't interest me at all and the vampire one wasn't much better. I liked how Anita and Jean-Claude's relationship started to change. I also liked how Larry and Jason got a lot of face time. (Whatever happened to Larry? Did he drop off the face of the earth or something?) Oh well, at least it made up for the lack of Jean-Claude in the previous book.	2004-06-11

I always enjoy this series but I didn't like this book quite as much as the others. Sookie's relationship with Eric got on my nerves a bit but I can't really say why without spoiling the entire book.

It has a lot of highly amusing Joss quotes. The guy is genuinely funny. It was nice to learn about his movie career because I didn't know too much about it. It has a lot of great Buffy information but it could have used more on Angel. It has a section on Firefly even though it was written before the show aired. The section on Joss' Fray comic convinced me that I need to go buy it now. My only major complaints are that the writer misspelled a character's name and the lack of Angel information. Despite those flaws, any fan of Joss Whedon will enjoy this book.	2004-06-11

I really enjoyed how the main character changed as she grew up. Her changing views on the people around her gave this coming of age story believability. I also liked the setting. It's was more of a historical setting than a fantasy one but the fantasy element was still there. I enjoyed this book so much I've decided to read anything by Sharon Shinn I can get a hold of.	2004-06-11

This book loosely ties in with The Boy Next Door but I didn't find it as enjoyable. The characters were fun as ever but I missed the all e-mail format. Switching back and forth between e-mails, diary entries, and recorded interviews didn't make the book feel very fluid. Don't get me wrong, I did like the book.

Fun little book that compiles many of the most memorable quotes for all seven seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The book covers a wide range of quotes from the hilarious to the touching. I really enjoyed this book but I do have a few complaints. I noticed an error, they have the Xander/Andrew talking about Anya's death quote labeled as coming from \\"End of Days\\" instead of \\"Chosen.\\" I think there may have been a few more mistakes but I'd have to check on those. Also, The book didn't have my favorite quote which is; \\"For God's sake, man, she's eighteen. And you have the emotional maturity of a blueberry scone. Just have at it, would you, and stop fluttering about.\\" ~ Giles to Wesley (The Prom) Still, If you are a die hard Buffy fan I highly recommend this book. It's good for quick Buffy fixes on the go.	2003-12-14

The holiday is only a few days away and she doesn't have presents or a tree. What she does have is a strange man in her apartment. She's not too rattled because, lets face it, this isn't the first time she's found a strange man in her apartment. His name is Diesel and he seems harmless enough and is even willing to help Stephanie track down bail hopping toy maker, Sandy Claws. But when they find Sandy, Diesel may not be too willing to hand him over.<br />This Stephanie Plum side story takes place between the 8th and 9th books but can really be read at any time. Unless you are fanatical about avoiding spoilers. I liked this one for the most part. Stephanie and Christmas cheer make a hilarious combination. There were even a few scenes that had me laughing uncontrollably. However, I wasn't overly fond of the plot. It was a bit preposterous even for Stephanie Plum. Fans of the series will surly enjoy this book and it's also good for relieving holiday stress.	2003-11-15

Throughout Skala's history a line of warrior queens have protected the land but when King Erius usurped his sister's throne, plague and drought overran the land. The only way to change this is to restore the female line to the throne. However, finding a new queen of royal blood is no easy task since every female who has even a distant claim to the throne is murdered. That all changes when Ariani, the King's sister, gives birth to twins; a boy and a girl. The boy twin is murdered so that, through dark magic, the girl can take his form. Consequently, young Tobin grows up, unaware of his true identity and perpetually haunted by the ghost of his murdered brother.<br />Very interesting fantasy that borders on dark fantasy. I loved Lynn Flewelling's Nightrunner series so I ran out and bought this one as soon as it came out. Then I stupidly let this gem of a book sit on my bookshelf for two years. Normally when a character in a fantasy novel is a child I'm bored to tears until they grow up but that wasn't the case with Tobin. I adored him and a lot of the other characters, although not quite as much as the Nightruner characters. However, I do think this book is a much more fluid read than the Nightrunner books. Anyway, this book is highly recommended even if you haven't read any of the author's previous work.	2003-11-15

She's held captive as a perspective meal for another vampire captive but he refuses to kill her. In her attempts to escape, Sunshine discovers more about herself and her past than she ever wanted to know and she's afraid she may loose her normal life forever.<br />Robin McKinley is my favorite author and when I found out she was writing a book about one of my favorite subjects (vampires) I was ecstatic. But I didn't even have a clue this book would be so good. I'm not exaggerating a bit when I say that out of the eighty or so books I've read this year, this one is my favorite. McKinley has created a very interesting and original world that's equally fantasy and horror. The main character was also really great. She managed to be strong with out being one of those overly tough female characters that seem to be so popular in vampire books these days. I also really loved the not quite romance between the main characters. Anyway, this book is well worth the hardcover price so go get it now.	2003-11-15

She has no clue what vampires are suppose to do in her situation but she figures she needs someone to do her bidding during the day. So she picks up Tommy, a gullible[]aspiring writer. Things are going as well as can be expected with Jody and Tommy until the vampire that turned her decides to screw with their heads.<br />This book was pretty darn amusing and full of offbeat humor. I loved the oddball characters and quirky situations littered through out the book. I wasn't overly interested in the plot but that didn't really matter much. This is the only Christopher Moore book I've read but I'll most likely be reading more. If you like wacky humor with a little horror and romance then you should try this book.	2003-11-04

Griet starts off as a maid in the painter's house but she is soon made his assistant and eventually his model. While this is going on she also has to deal with being away from home for the first time, Vermeer's wife and daughter's jealousy, and her growing attraction to the painter. <br />Not the kind of book I usually read but it was enjoyable. It was a bit on the slow side but the book itself was short so that didn't really bother me. It could also be vague in places but this is one of those books where some things are better left to the imagination. If you are an art dork or you just like good fiction in general you'll probably enjoy this book.	2003-11-04

Suze has her work cut out for her when she discovers that \\"Red\\" is really eccentric millionaire Thaddeus Beaumont, and all signs point to his being a murder. Suze also has a new love interest, Tad, who just happens to be Mr. Beaumont's son.<br />This book was pretty good but a few things did get on my nerves. Suze's constant complaining that Tad was the only boy to ever ask her out was really annoying because two boys asked her out in the first book. Also, in the beginning, the book kept skipping around in time which was really awkward. Other than those minor complaints I really enjoyed the second book in the series, but not quite as much as the first.	2003-11-04

Eliza wants Henry to teach her to speak more like a lady so she can get a nice job. Henry only decides to teach her after making a bet with his pal, Col. Pickering, that in six months he'll be able to pass Eliza off as a duchess. <br />If that plot seems familiar to you then you've seen the movie &quot;My fair Lady&quot; which is based on this book. I think it's pretty safe to say that if you liked that movie you'll like this book. This book's witty dialogue and cracks at England's social structure had me giggling out loud on more than a few occasions. Actually the whole book is a quick, fun read that I'd recommend to pretty much everyone.	2003-11-04

Suze's charge is eight year old Jack Slater, who was utterly boring until Suze discovered he is also a mediator. Things haven't remained quiet on the ghost front either. Maria de Silva, Jessie's fiance/murder, has returned from the dead to finish the job she started more than a century ago.<br />This is the fourth installment in The Mediator series and probably my favorite one as well. The plot followed the basic `murderous ghost somehow tied to Suze's latest love interest' plot except this time the love interest was Jessie. Yay for the plot finally going somewhere. I also really liked Jack and thought it was cool that Suze got a tiny mediator to teach (or corrupt) This series is still really fun for a light read and I'm sure future books in the series will be just as good.	2003-11-04

Unfortunately, the hook of the show is that she, and the other constants, must survive five days in a haunted house. Cordy figures this will be an easy win because this is hardly the first time she's had to sleep in a haunted house. However, the first night in the house Cordy has a vision of a girl in trouble, but with few ways to get information to Angel and the others the girl's chances don't look good. <br />I know this book sounds like it's Cordy-centric but in fact equal time is given to all the main characters. This is good in some ways and bad in others. Gunn's storyline does have some interesting moments and Wesley's was pretty funny at times but other than that the rest of the boys' attempts to solve the mystery are pretty dull. Cordy's storyline was by far the most interesting but it's not really given enough time to be as good as it could have been. Also, many of the original characters weren't really necessary and made the novel feel even more disjointed. Overall this is a fairly decent Angel novel but I've read better by this author.	2003-11-04

Jessica finally decides to move on from what happened with Marcus and begins dating her academic rival, Len Levy. But Jessica's feelings for Marcus aren't as buried as she'd like them to be, which doesn't bode well for her and Lens' relationship. Meanwhile, Jessica is determined to make the right choice for college so she isn't miserable for the next four years as well. She has her heart set on Columbia but after the 9/11 attacks she has second thoughts about attending a school in New York.<br />I liked this book almost as much as the first one which is to say I liked it a whole darn lot. I was happy that the book continued to be realistic instead of descending into teen romance mush. I was satisfied with the ending and it seemed pretty final but I still can't help but want to read about Jessica's college exploits. Anyway, fans of the first book will be happy with this one.	2003-11-04

After years of being emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins she was finally allowed to go to school. However going to school didn't improve her standard of living much. Jane began to feel that there was something else out there for her so she took a job as governess at Thornfield Hall. Everything was going well until she fell in love with her employer, Mr. Rochester.<br />Jane Eyre is one of my absolute favorite books. I just really love all the characters and the dramatic plot twists. A lot of people who read this book just think it's a romance novel. While it is true that Romance plays a large part, the book is much more than just your run of the mill romance. People who are able to get the `just a romance novel' idea out of their heads will see that the book is more about a woman trying to find a better life against great odds.	2003-11-04

When the dust settles, Fred is gone. So Angel Investigations starts.. well.. investigating. They begin by questioning the various demon witnesses all of whom have, of course, different stories to tell. As the night goes on Angel begins to realize that the only way to save Fred may be to sacrifice himself. <br />This book has pretty much your basic `Fred's been kidnaped, must find Fred' storyline but what makes this book enjoyable is the firm handle the author has on the Angel universe. The characters are all perfectly in character. The dialogue was great. The author even brings up a few pieces of Angel trivia that only fanatical Angel fans will remember easily. Also, since the book takes place in early season three, it was nice to see the characters just joke around together like friends. You know, like they did before the all fell in love with each other. Jeff Mariotte's extensive knowledge of everything Angel made what could have been a very boring book into an enjoyable addition to the Angel universe. I'm sure I'll be reading more Angel books by him in the future.	2003-11-04

Jessica is also having boy trouble. The school's star jock, Scott, wants to date her but Jessica finds herself oddly attracted to Marcus, the school junkie.<br />This is the best teen novel that I've read in ages. Finally a novel about high school life that hasn't been watered down for younger readers. Jessica's bleak and sarcastic narrative about her fellow classmates will appeal to everyone who was miserable in high school. Daria fans will especially enjoy this series. I recommend this book to everyone, even people who can't stand the thought of reading a teen book.	2003-10-01

She must fend off snakes, spiders, geese, and a lunatic in a bunny suit. Also, with Morelli out of the picture, Ranger steps up his pursuit of Stephanie.<br />The thing that I love about this series is that it's dependable. You can always count on Stephanie blowing up a few cars and the Stephanie/Morelli/Ranger love triangle will probably never be resolved. It's also the only series that I can think of that is repetitive with out becoming boring or going down in quality. With Stephanie Plum you always know that you are going to get a zany, fun, mystery and that's a good thing.	2003-09-16

Vivian begins to hope that she can trust him with her secret. Meanwhile, the pack is in disarray while they battle it out over the position of leader. While this continues no wolf or human is safe, including Aiden.<br />This book was very different from a lot of YA books I've read. The author does a really good job of writing the animalistic side of Vivian's personality. It was also petty adult for a YA book as the sex and violence aren't too watered down. People who are looking for fluffy romance with supernatural bits thrown in are going to be disappointed. However, if you like good werewolf books this one shouldn't be missed.	2003-09-16

Fortunately she makes new friends quickly. Unfortunately there's also a pair of ghosts making her life miserable. You see, Susannah is a mediator and it's her job to help ghosts move on to the afterlife but it's not so easy to get certain ghosts to move on.<br />This is the first book in The Mediator series written by Princess Diaries author, Meg Cabot. I really enjoyed this book. The plot was pretty run of the mill but I really liked the heroine. I love it when heroines are a little bit of a witch. I liked some of the supporting characters as well. Fans of teen horror or just good teen fiction should really give this series a try. I'm totally hooked and I hope to get my hands on the rest of the series very soon.	2003-09-16

When the tribe is left without a magician Alanna must train a new one before she can move on. Alanna's personal life also heats up when Prince Jon asks her to marry him!<br />I didn't enjoy this one as much as the first two. The Bazhir plot line, which took up most of the book, just didn't interest me. The book did become more enjoyable towards the end though. I'd recommend just skipping over this book but the last half is important to the rest of the series. Oh well, hardcore fans of this series will no doubt enjoy this otherwise, just suffer through it like I did.	2003-08-26

Mia is less than pleased to be visiting the country she will someday rule because it is taking her away from her new boyfriend, Michael. When Mia finally returns to New York her relationship with Michael still doesn't run smoothly. She is constantly convinced that Michael is going to dump her and Grandmere's interference isn't helping one bit.<br />I was kind of bored by the beginning of this book but Mia's Jane Eyre obsession and the constant digs at the Princess Diaries Disney movie made me interested again. While this isn't the best book in the series fans will not be disappointed. The series still retains everything that made it enjoyable in the first place and will leave fans waiting eagerly for the fifth book.	2003-08-26

She's really fond of handsome handyman Dean but she doesn't want him to get killed in the battle against good and evil. To make matters more confusing, her smart-mouthed cat, Austin, and her annoying little sister, Diana, are determined to meddle in Claire and Deans' relationship. Just when Claire thinks she's worked her personal life out, the power of darkness and light start wreaking havoc in the form of hormone driven teenagers.<br />The Second Summoning is every bit as hilarious as the first book in the series. However, this time around the book is as much from Diana's point of view as it is from Claire's. The switching POVs makes this book seem more like part of a series. I really liked the plot but I found myself missing Claire and Deans' plot line. Anyway, fans of supernatural humor really should give this series a shot.	2003-08-26

It answers a lot of questions fans may have about Sinclair but it's also really well written. You can tell the author did her homework. Sinclair is completely in character and the nuances of Minbari society are explained even better than on the show. Marcus fans may be a bit disappointed since the bulk of the book focuses on Sinclair but I'm sure they'll find something to like. If this book is any indication of the quality of the other Babylon 5 books then I hope they come back into print quickly.	2003-08-26

His life changes forever when Aleksander, prince of the Derzhi Empire, buys him. Aleksander is a strict master at first but Seyonne soon realizes there is a goodness in Aleksander that may be important in the Ezzarians' battle against the demons. <br />This is the best fantasy novel I've read in a long time. It has all of the elements of a great fantasy novel but at the same time is very original. The characters are complex and the plot is intriguing. Anyone who considers them self a fan of fantasy should not pass this one up.	2003-08-26

In this modern take on Beauty and the Beast artist Alix Miller is hired to paint wealthy recluse Leland Crompton. Alix is shocked to learn that Leland suffers from a physical deformity but she soon learns to overlook it. The two become friends but when Alix realizes she's in love with Leland she has a hard time convincing him her feelings are real.<br />I'm a [fan of] Beauty and the Beast so I , of course, loved this book. The characters and plot were engrossing and fit well with the Beauty and the Beast theme. The writing was very good considering this is a romance novel but there was a couple of really cheesy lines in every chapter. I also hated the ending. I'm sure the author was trying to make some sort of statement with it but it wasn't really necessary. Overall this book is wonderful, I'll just skip the end if I decide to re-read it.	2003-08-26

Sort of Giles centered novel that contains novelizations of the Buffy episodes \\"Helpless,\\" \\"A New Man,\\" and \\"Blood Ties.\\" All of these episodes took place on Buffy's birthday. In \\"Helpless\\" Buffy is given a test by the watches' council that takes away her slayer strength and forces Giles to betray her. \\"A New Man\\" features the return of Ethan Rayne who turns Giles into a demon. \\"Blood Ties\\" takes place during the fifth season when Dawn finds out she's the key.<br />I was pretty disappointed by this book. Giles is such an interesting character and the best they could come up with was not much more than a script book that is only kind of Giles centered. The first part, \\"Helpless,\\" wasn't even all that well written. The author managed to make the character's thoughts so shallow and inane that I felt the need to bang my head against the wall repeatedly. \\"A New Man\\" was the only truly Giles centered part of the book. The novelization of this episode is the only reason Giles fans should read this book. \\"Blood Ties\\" was just kind of there. The concept of this book wouldn't have been so bad if these episodes had been told only from Giles' perspective. That would have supported the plot better since Giles is suppose to be reading these stories from his journal. As it is, this book is basically just a script book with a little bit of the characters' thoughts filled in.	2003-08-26

He promises the woman's father that he can make her a wedding gown of gold. The father says that if the tailor's boast is true then he will allow the woman to marry him. He manages to spin straw into gold and make the dress but he becomes a cripple in the process. Because of his condition, he loses the woman he loves and their unborn daughter. <br />Spinners is a bittersweet retelling of Rumpelstiltskin. It far surpasses the original story because it examines all the characters' motivations which makes the story more meaningful. The characters are very well written and the authors really make you feel for all of them. I found myself wanting every character to have a happy ending even though I knew that wasn't likely. If you are a fan of re-told fairy tales then I highly recommend Spinners. I know I'll probably read everything by Donna Jo Napoli that I can get my hands on.	2003-08-26

One day when she is exploring her new house, she finds a doorway to another world. At first glance, this world seems to be just like Coraline's own, only more interesting, but she soon begins to suspect that something evil is waiting for her there.<br />Coraline is a terrifying yet charming children's book that can be equally enjoyed by adults. Some parents may think this book is too scary for children but this is the kind of book kids really love. Not only is the book's plot highly entertaining but there is a great moral to the story as well. I've read a couple of Neil Gaiman's other books but Coraline is my favorite of them all. Gaiman's style works well with the children's book format and Dave McKean's illustrations match the tone of the book perfectly. I think this one will stay fresh in my memory for a long time.	2003-08-26

Despite the fact that DeChooch is so old he can hardly see, Stephanie still can't catch him. The plot thickens when loveable stoners, Dougie and Mooner, go missing and Stephanie seems to be the only one willing to find them. As if all that wasn't enough, Stephanie's family wants her to start planing her wedding to Morelli and she isn't even sure if they are engaged!<br />The Stephanie Plum series is wacky, fun, and entertaining and this installment is no different. The thing I love most about this series is that Stephanie is a totally incompetent bounty hunter with out being dumb and insulting to women. The characters are fun as well and Stephanie, Morelli, and Ranger's love triangle is addictive. If you are looking for something to brighten your mood then I highly recommend this series.	2003-08-21

Damon wants to destroy his brother and keep Elena for himself and there doesn't seem to be much they can do to stop him. Damon isn't the only danger though, Caroline, Elena's arch rival, wants to destroy Elena and she doesn't care if Stefan gets caught in the crossfire. <br />This series is still quite readable but it hasn't improved much since the first volume. Every time I find myself starting to like Elena she does something stupid or gets all weepy for no reason. Also, Elena and Stefan's supposed inability to fight back against anyone that is trying to hurt them is just frustrating and ridiculous. Another thing that keeps this series from being great is Damon, he's just not a very compelling villain. However, L. J. Smith's addictive writing makes this an entertaining, quick read and the series is still good despite it's flaws.	2003-08-21

Most of the major fairy tales are covered here: Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood, Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, ect... Some of the stories are set in fantasy worlds but many are set in modern times.<br />This was an enjoyable and very light read but not much else. All of the stories were fun to read but my two favorites were Wolf and Beast. Wolf is a take on Little Red Riding Hood where a teenage girl runs away from her abusive father to her grandmother's house. Beast is a retelling of Beauty and the Beast that didn't stray far from the original. This was my favorite story in the book mainly because Beauty and the Beast is my favorite fairy tale. I recommend this book to any one who loves fairy tales.	2003-08-21

Riley Finn and his wife, Sam, have been called in by the government to investigate some killings along the Mexican border. Shortly after their investigation begins, they are kicked off the case and told it is closed. This doesn't sit well with the Finns so they decide to call Buffy and Angel for backup. Now the foursome have to fight off vampires, shape shifters, pushy strippers, and the west Nile virus!<br />The basic idea of this book had me excited because I'm one of the few people on the planet that actually like Riley. The plot was an ok idea too but the problem was that the book was pretty boring. There just wasn't enough character interaction. As a matter of fact, Buffy and Riley are hardly in it. Buffy mostly just drives the van as Riley babbles on about crows. Sam and Angel do most of the work. I hated Sam on the show but she was ok in this book although her flirtation with Angel was just gross. This isn't really a bad book but it's just too boring for me to entirely recommend.	2003-08-02

Elena is the most beautiful girl in school and she's dated many guys. Still, she's never even been close to falling for any of them. Then she meets Stefan, a handsome and mysterious new student. Elena really thinks she could be in love with him but there's one thing she doesn't know... he's a vampire. Stefan also has a vampire brother named Damon who, unlike Stefan, doesn't have any qualms about taking a human life. Will Elena be able to avoid getting caught up in their sibling rivalry?<br />This is my least favorite L. J. Smith book I've read so far. I couldn't really get attached to any of the characters. Elena is a bit too full of herself to be really likeable and Stefan and Damon are really cliche. The book is still a decent read and fans of teen vampire books will enjoy it. I'll most likely be finishing the series.	2003-07-31

After investigating the source of a severe vampire attack at the magic box, Buffy discovers some very strange occurrences. Such as Sid the dummy and Kakistos, the ancient vampire that killed Faith's first watcher, mysteriously coming back to life. Things get even worse when Ethan Rayne shows up. He's apparently run afoul of the First and has named Buffy, Faith, Spike, Willow, and Xander his protectors. <br />I usually don't read Buffy fiction but I couldn't pass this one up because I'm a huge Ethan Rayne fan. Alas, this book was disappointing to say the least. The bulk of the book is made up of very boring fight scenes that go on for far too long. What little plot the book contains is completely ridiculous and would severely mess with the continuity of season seven. The Ethan parts were pretty dissatisfying as well, especially since there was no Ethan/Giles interaction. A little humor would have gone a long way towards making this book tolerable but most of the jokes were just not funny. The only good thing I can say about this book is that everyone seemed to be in character to a certain degree. Still, avoid this one at all costs!	2003-07-31

Jill Valentine is once again trapped in a zombie filled nightmare in this, the novelization of the third Resident Evil video game. Raccoon City has been completely lost to the T-Virus and Jill realizes all she can do is try to escape the city. However, this won't be an easy task. She must battle zombies, mutants, and a new tyrant that has been programed to kill Jill and her fellow S.T.A.R.S. teammates. Fortunately Jill is not alone, hapless Umbrella mercenary, Carlos, proves to be a useful ally.<br />I love the Resident Evil video game series but I go into hysterics whenever I play them so I read the novels instead. These books could easily be boring and tedious but they are actually quite good. The author focuses on characterization instead of attempting to capture every puzzle and battle. However, the books still manage to be suspenseful and will keep you on the edge of your seat. This book is my favorite in the series because Jill and Carlos are the most interesting characters in the Resident Evil universe. All of the novelizations of the games are good though and you don't even need to be familiar with the games to enjoy them.	2003-07-31

Now she has to dodge the media and fulfill her duties as the teen ambassador to the U. N. Her romantic life also gets more complicated when the President's son takes an interest in her. <br />This book is every bit as enjoyable as the Princess Diaries Series and fans of that series should run out and buy it this second! Sam has a lot in common with Mia but is different enough that you won't feel like you are reading the same book twice. I especially like this books because it's filled with art humor and Gwen Stefani worship which I can identify with. I hope Meg Cabot decides to write a sequel.	2003-07-31

All the characters in the series were finally fleshed out and most of them turned out to be pretty interesting. I liked how Cassie slowly changed from the shy girl she was in the first book to a kick butt witch. She's probably my favorite L. J. Smith heroine. The ending of the series was a little to happy to be realistic but I liked it anyway. I highly recommend this series to fans of teen horror.	2003-07-09

Although the orphans aren't too fond of their new home they decide that it's much better than living with Count Olaf. Still, things go from bad to worse when a disguised Count Olaf shows up and none of the adults believe that it's really him. <br />I liked this one a bit more than the second one, mainly because there was less of Mr. Poe. That man is really starting to get on my nerves. Besides that this book pretty much follows the same formula as the second. Surprisingly enough the series still hasn't gotten stale. Lemony Snicket's way with words and the orphans still keep this series interesting.	2003-07-09

Claidi has lived her entire life as an orphaned maid in the House, a town isolated from the outside world. Claidi has always been told that the world outside the House is full of poison and nearly impossible to live in. Her life changes when a handsome young man from the outside world is captured and imprisoned in the House. Claidi decides to rescue the man and they escape into the outside world.<br />I really liked this book but not quite as much as some of Tanith Lee's adult books. The world is very interesting and Claidi is a great heroine. I also liked the diary format the book is written in. I never really got too attached to any of the side characters but this will probably change in future books. The shocking twist at the end may turn a few people off but it also really separates this book from others like it. If you like YA fantasy/adventure then you should give this series a shot.	2003-07-09

Still, Cassie feels trapped and her only way to be free may be to join the dark side.<br />I enjoyed this one just as much as the first. The action didn't slow down and I was hooked throughout the entire thing. I also liked Cassie's brush with the dark side. It gave the series a depth that it may not have had otherwise. Another thing I liked was how the coven was no longer split up into groups of good and bad members. All in all this is a great middle book that doesn't fail to live up to the first.	2003-07-09

She gets the job and all is going well until she develops feelings for Matt, the handsome cowboy that's training her. <br />I liked the book far more than Amelia and the Outlaw, the other book in this series by Lorraine Heath. Not that I didn't like Amelia and the Outlaw but Sam is a far more appealing heroine. She may even be my favorite heroine in the entire series. The plot and the romance were also really fun.

As if that wasn't enough to fear, during the course of the book a war breaks out and Alanna must survive that as well.<br />I liked this book about as much as the first one. The characters are enjoyable and the love triangle was quite enthralling as well. The plot is basically a good one but it loses a lot of it's effectiveness through the pacing. The book covers four years and every time I got comfortable with events that were occurring the book would skip ahead a year.

Many of the other characters get a lot of development as well, especially Neville, Snape, and Sirius. All in all this is my second favorite of all the Harry Potter novels.

Fearing more scandal for turning down the proposal, she decides to vacation with Ewan in Scotland. She would be enjoying her vacation but Ewan's cousin, Jaime, and her are constantly arguing. Emily highly doubts that her and the brash scot will ever get along. <br />This book is the sequel to a previous Avon True Romance, Anna and the Duke, but it's not really necessary to read that one to understand this one. Emily and the Scot is a watered down but well done type of love/hate story. Although Emily and Jamie never really hated each other their personalities just grate against one another's. The characters were vibrant and the romance managed to remain interesting throughout the entire book. I also really enjoyed the ending. The author showed great restraint in making it a happy but realistic one. Emily and the Scot and Anna and the Duke are two of the best books this series has to offer and I highly recommend them both.	2003-06-20

Thursday Next is an operative in the Special Operations Network's Literary Division. When Thursday is recruited to help capture high profile criminal, Acheron Hades, she's thrilled at the chance for career advancement. However, Acheron comes up with a devious plot to kidnap literary characters and forever change the novels they come from. <br />I picked up this book because Jane Eyre is one of my absolute favorite books. I couldn't pass up the chance to see familiar characters in new situations. I was pleasantly surprised that the entire book, not just the Jane Eyre parts, were highly enjoyable. The setting is quirky and interesting and Thursday is a heroine I'd gladly keep reading about. Fforde could certainly get a lot of mileage out of this series before it gets stale. The writing is witty and full of literary jokes. A good portion of the book is purely Sci-Fi so people who can't stand that genre may want to skip it.	2003-06-19

In the first book in the series, teenage Poppy discovers she has terminal cancer. Things look pretty bleak for Poppy till her best friend and secret crush, James, reveals that he is a vampire and that he wants to make her one as well. Poppy isn't out of the woods yet, by making her a vampire James has broken the laws of the night world which could cost him and Poppy their lives.<br />This is probably the best L. J. Smith book I've read so far. I enjoyed it so much I read it practically in one sitting. The characters, plot, and pacing were all perfect and the writing was very emotional as well. Smith's vampires are different from any I've read about before. She's also created a very intriguing world that makes me want to track down the rest of the series. Fans of teen horror, vampire fiction, or even just good romance should give this one a try.	2003-06-19

A new judge believes that Jessie's ten year sentence may be a bit to harsh and decided to let Jessie work off the rest of his sentence at his ranch. Jessie really doesn't want to mess up this second chance but when the judge's daughter, Amelia, takes an interest in him Jessie finds her hard to resist. The Judge is very protective of his daughter and if he catches them together he'll send Jessie back to jail. <br />This is one of the better Avon True Romances. The author focuses more on character development and romance than on the plot. The pacing is also very good. Jessie is a pretty likeable character. Amelia got on my nerves at first but I grew to like her. The romance was well done and enjoyable even though I never got overly attached to either of the characters. I look forward to reading Samantha and the Cowboy, another Avon True Romance by this author.	2003-06-19

Once they enter the shadow world a new and even more deadly game begins because in this world, their nightmares are more real than ever. Trapped in a demonic carnival they are at the mercy of not only Julian, but all the other frightening creatures of the shadow world. Will Jenny and her friends all make it out or have they bitten off more then they can chew?<br />I was fairly pleased with the conclusion to the series although the ending was a bit disappointing. This is probably the most well written book out of the three. I nearly cried during some of the scenes. I was also happy that Michael got some character development at last. Actually the characters in general were handled very well, especially Julian. Besides the slightly disappointing ending, the only other complaint I have is that it was far too short. The first book in the series still remains my favorite but this one comes in at a very close second. I highly recommend this series.	2003-06-19

Her sister, Laurel, and their father <BR>constantly worry that she'll never find a husband and settle down. Their fears seem unfounded when Rois becomes obsessed with a man, Corbet, she sees in the woods one day. Rois is determined to find out more about Corbet and she soon discovers that his family is under a curse. She wants to break the curse so they can be together but her dreams are shattered when Laurel and Corbet take a liking to each other.<br />I enjoyed the premise of this book but the plot took forever to go anywhere. I like the dreamlike parts of the book to a certain extent but they just took up too much of the book for me to enjoy them totally. I probably would have liked this more as a short story. As for the characters, I loved Rois, hated Laurel, and was indifferent to Corbet. Even though this book didn't impress me too much I may try something else by this writer. The writing is quite good. If you like dreamlike mysteries you'll probably enjoy this book. I just prefer something a little more solid.	2003-06-07

Even though only men can be made into Wraeththu every member of the race is both male and female and they can even give birth. Wraeththu is actually three books in one. The first centers around Pellaz, a human turned Wraeththu who eventually becomes leader of the species. The second follows Swift, a natural born Wraeththu and son of the leader of a violent tribe. The last book returns to Cal, an important character from the first two books. <br />These books have everything you could ask for; great characters, plot, and writing. It really doesn't get much better than this. It took me a while to finish all three books because I'd get so attached to one character that it would be hard to switch over to another. The books may be a bit slow moving for some. There's a lot of gradual characterization and very little action. Fans of good fantasy should give this one a try but if you are homophobic, avoid it like the plague.	2003-06-02

In 1500's B.C. Methos travels to Egypt only to discover it is being occupied by a brutal race known as the Hyksos. Methos decides to get the hell out of dodge but he's unwittingly drawn into the fight to rid Egypt of Hyksos rule. His task becomes even more perilous because a Hyksos prince turns out to be an immortal, and a completely insane one at that. Meanwhile, back in present day New York, Methos and Duncan suspect that a killing spree is tied to Methos' past. <br />This really is a three star book but since I lust after Methos it gets four. The plot isn't really anything special but is interesting enough to keep you reading, even though it's pretty predictable. Methos and Duncan were well written and in character but many of the secondary characters were one dimensional. The writing overall is adequate but the author's tendency to repeat herself and state the obvious got on my nerves after a while. Methos fans will enjoy this book but if you aren't that interested in him, skip it.	2003-05-31

She stops at a hotel one night and awakes to find she is now the owner of the hotel. Of course this is not ordinary hotel. It comes complete with a hole to hell, a sleeping evil Keeper, and some truly ugly furniture. Fortunately for Clare the place isn't a complete loss, It comes with a pair of very hot men. There's Dean, a handsome handy man who's only fault is that he's way too young. Then there's Jacques, a very sexy French Canadian who's only problem is that he's also very dead. <br />My favorite thing about Tanya Huff's writing is that she rarely takes herself too seriously. This is probably why Summon the Keeper is my favorite book by her. It's a very silly book that has almost no plot but fun characters. Well that's not entirely true, it does have a plot but the plot doesn't take up a lot of the book. The book is mostly filled up with funky little side stories and sticky character situations. Anyone who likes horror with a lot of comedy will like this one.	2003-05-30

He's been secretive and distant lately but things completely fall apart when she discovers he's been cheating on her! Not only that but he's been kidnaped as well. Sookie considers letting him rot but her conscience (and Eric) urges her to rescue him... then kick his butt. Rescuing vampires isn't really the safest of tasks so Eric gets her some protection in the form of Alcide, a hunky werewolf. The more she gets to know Alcide the more he seems like the perfect guy for her.<br />I still didn't enjoy this one as much as the first but it was a much better put together book than the second. The best thing about this book is that it proves that the series doesn't depend on Sookie and Bill's relationship to be enjoyable. Some people may not like this turn in the series but I think it was the right decision. Like it or hate it you'll probably be on the edge of your seat waiting for the next one. Lets hope we don't have to wait too long.	2003-05-30

No one believes them about their friend's death and the paper house is still missing. When they finally find the paper house it is ripped to shreds and they don't know if Julian was released or not. All is soon reveled and they begin a new deadly game where Jenny's friends are disappearing one by one.<br />This book wasn't nearly as good as the first one. The first half of the book is pretty dull. The action does pick up but it's barley enough to make up for the first half. I did like how we got to know the characters better but I didn't like how little Julian there was. The book kind of struck me as a filler book but I'm sure the last in the series will be much better.	2003-05-12

She didn't think the audition went well because she overheard the snobbish yet handsome director, Harry Noble, insulting her. Jasmin is shocked when she learns she landed a part and the part of the female lead, Elizabeth Bennett, at that! Things are not so easy for Jasmin because Harry is particularly hard on her and is always watching her. During all the time Jasmin spends trashing Harry to anyone who will listen she never suspects that her life has started to imitate the play. <br />For people familiar to the plot of Pride and Prejudice this book really won't hold any surprises for you. All of the characters in the book are updated replicas of the parts they have in the play. The character interactions are also the same as in P&amp;P and, aside for the premise, there's not much originality. Jasmin's life away from the play is also quite boring. Other than that the book is an enjoyable light read. The writing is fairly witty and the characters are likeable. P&amp;P fans should at least give it a look just don't expect it to be on the same level as the original.	2003-05-12

She hangs out with her friends, talks about pop culture, and is failing math. Mia is absolutely devastated when her Mom starts dating her math teacher, which is sure to add to her freak reputation. Things go from bad to worse when Mia finds out she's the princess of Genovia. She is desperate to keep this a secret even from her closest friends. To further complicate things, her Grandmother shows up and starts insisting Mia take princess lessons. <br />The plot of this book just sounds like your average rags to riches story but what saves it from that cliche is the characters. For once a writer has gotten how geeky teenage girls talk and act right. From major things like Mia and her best friend's fight to trivial things like how Mia's father reminds her of Captain Picard, Meg Cabot has really hit the nail on the head. Meg Cabot's attention to detail is another thing that makes this a fun read. I have no doubt that most teenage girls will enjoy this book but please don't make your decision to read it based on how much you like the Disney movie of the same name, which retains little of the book's charm.	2003-05-12

She would be thrilled except he isn't the one she wanted. When her new boyfriend confessed his love for her Mia decides she has to dump him. However, there are many things that keep her from doing this, not the least of which is her desire not to be dateless at the big dance. Mia's guilt begins to eat at her and she has an important trip to Genovia to worry about as well.<br />Princess in Love offers up pretty much the same witty writing and quirky characters that you loved in the first two but is made even more interesting by Mia's love triangle. In the spirit of all princess stories there's a fairy tale ending and Meg Cabot manages to keep it from being cheesy. This is probably my favorite of the series so far. The series has reached a turning point and I'm afraid that after this the series will loose a lot of steam. We'll see...	2003-05-12

Lecter's answers get Clarice involved with the hunt for a serial killer known as only Buffalo Bill. <BR>What started as an odd but safe assignment may lead Clarice to catch a killer or it may end her career or even her life. <br />I can't really say much about the plot of this book but you've probably seen the movie anyway. This is probably one of the best books I've ever read. It really sucks you in and won't let you go till you're finished. Harris has an interesting way with characterization. A simple, unimportant fact about a character can render you emotionally connected to them. You'll like this book if you like the movie. You'll like this book if you like thrillers. You'll like this book if you are just a fan of well written books. Whatever, just get it!	2003-05-12

Her plan gets her into the school but she has to learn to be as strong as the boys. Her problems only begin there. Because of a dark power that is brewing, Alanna must learn to use her magic, a power she fears. <br />This book was ok but not really as in depth as some of Tamora Pierce's other books I've read. It's also stretched over too long a time for such a short novel. Still, it is a fun read. I read it in one sitting actually. The best part of the book is the characters, most of whom are lively and fun. I don't really think that many adult readers will enjoy this book too much but I plan to continue with the series.	2003-05-12

She hopes that she will be chosen by Lady Alanna but expects to become a desk squire. She is presently surprised when Lord Raoul chooses her.<br />I didn't like this book as much as the first two but it's still a great book. The beginning was a bit on the boring side but the plot picked up before I was thoroughly bored. I kind of missed the school setting and I really missed a lot of the characters. The book was also more action packed than the others which was a good and a bad thing. I really liked the romance even though Kel's boyfriend was not who I'd have picked for her (I'm not telling who it is) This was a good book but I'm not really as anxious to start the fourth one as I was the third.	2003-05-12

Why does a evil old woman want to kill her for a ruby she doesn't have? And what happened to a good deal of her inheritance money? Sally soon learns she must find the answer to these questions if she hopes to survive. <br />I've read a bit of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials Series and wasn't too impressed bit I'm so glad I decided to pick up this book. I enjoyed pretty much everything about this book. The setting, characters, and plot were all highly entertaining. Although it's a quick read, it's still a well fleshed out and complicated story. I'm amazed Pullman was able to pull all that off in such a short book. I'll certainly be reading the other books in the series and maybe I'll even give His Dark Materials another shot.	2003-05-12

The father of the child is her algebra teacher, a subject which she still isn't doing all that well in. To make matters worse, her grandmother insists on planing an unwanted wedding for the soon to be parents. Mia's spirits are lifted when she starts to receive letters from a secret admirer, who she hopes is her long time crush, Michael.<br />This book is pretty much more of the same. If you liked the first one you'll like this one. It's kind of a transition book leading up to the major plot advancement of Mia's love life in the third book. What I love about this series is how the trivial stuff almost totally makes me forget about the princess plot, which would make a pretty boring book by itself. You may not enjoy this one quite as much as the first but it's still a really fun read.	2003-05-12

Musette takes a disturbing interest in Asher and Anita will have to go to great lengths to keep him safe. There are also a series of gruesome murders that are not easy to solve especially since Dolph's pent up rage has started to explode.<br />This is hardly the best book of the series but it put to rest all my fears about this series going bad. The only thing really wrong with the book is the pacing of the plot. Laurell K. Hamilton needs to either write longer books or not try and cram so many sub plots into them. Where this book really shines is character development. Anita finally gets some much needed character development that will keep her character for getting stale. Some fans will undoubtedly not like her change in character though. This will really please Asher fans. He gets a lot of scenes and a few of them are some of the most emotional writing Laurell K. Hamilton has ever done. Jason also gets some character growth as does Richard. This book even gives me hope for Richard. If you've given up on the series you should still give this book a shot because you may be pleasantly surprised.	2003-05-12

For a long time Miranda refuses to follow any orders no matter what Shadow Walker does but they eventually take a liking to each other. Much still stands in the would be couple's way especially the fact that Miranda is still Shadow Walker's captive. <br />This book has a few flaws but I liked it in spite of them. The beginning of the book is very rushed and Miranda isn't likeable at all in the beginning. The pacing and Miranda's characterization improve quickly though. I really enjoyed the plot of this book and I adored Shadow Walker. I felt that the animosity between the Indians and the white men was downplayed quite a bit but that is understandable considering this is a teen romance. The only thing that keeps this from being a really great book is it's length. I prefer my books to be meatier than 197 pages. Still the book is well worth your time.	2003-03-31

Old enemies and budding womanhood are among Kel's biggest problems and her school work never lets up. Old friends and new make Kel's school experience bearable and she even develops her first crush.<br />I enjoyed this book even more than the first one. Kel is still a wonderful main character and her friends grew even more likeable. I also liked how Kel's quick thinking on the battle field made more people respect her. Even though this book covers more time than the first it didn't feel rushed at all. It's all pretty much more of the same so if you liked the first book you'll like this one as well.	2003-03-31

The plot is exciting and the pacing of it is perfect. The two main characters are full of personality and are the type you really root for. I really liked many of the secondary characters as well.

Barbara's success is a thorn in the side to hot-shot, ladies' man reporter Catcher Block. Catcher soon cooks up a scheme to discredit Barbara as a feminist icon, by making her fall in love. <br />Down With Love is just your basic romantic comedy, you'll have fun reading it but won't really think about it too much afterwards. The plot was fun and full of interesting characters, witty dialogue, and lots of mistaken identities. The characters were especially interesting because I wasn't sure till the end weather I liked or hated them. Down With Love is worth a read if you are a fan of romantic comedies.	2003-03-28

She is put on probation and has one year to prove that she is able to keep up with her fellow students. <br />Tamora Pierce's writing is given glowing recommendations every time I read something about her so I decided to give it a try and Protector of the Small: First Test did not disappoint me. I liked the school setting of the book and some of the secondary characters were interesting as well. The best part of the book is Kelandry. Her character is more reserved and realistic than most feminist fantasy heroines which was very refreshing. However, she's no pushover and should satisfy fans of [strong]heroines. Based on this book, I'll probably be reading anything by Tamora Pierce I can get my hands on.	2003-03-28

Jenny is apprehensive about the game but it turns out to be a big hit with her friends until they are sucked into the game and forced to live out their worst nightmares. <br />The Hunter is a fast paced blend of horror, action, mystery, and romance. It's different from any other teen horror I've ever read and I was so hooked on it that I read it in one sitting. I enjoyed many of the characters, especially Julian who is the villain of the book.

Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin. Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life?<br />The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem. The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book. Unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series, skip this one.	2003-03-25

Don't Bite the Sun familiarizes us with with the young, mostly female protagonist (we never learn her name) and the world in which she lives. In this world you can change bodies and genders as often as you want, all you have to do is kill yourself. You can marry and divorce in the space of an afternoon and there is no such thing as crime. Our protagonist becomes increasingly unhappy with her meaningless life of pleasure and sets out to find something that makes her happy, and in her pursuit she rebels against society. Finally in Drinking Sapphire Whine she commits an act that cannot go unpunished and her life is changed forever. <br />Biting the Sun is one of the best sci-fi novels I've ever read. It's everything a sci-fi novel should be. Tanith Lee creates a world that fascinates you and characters you genuinely care about. The plot is very ambitious and it's successful in that it says something important about the meaning of life. Even if you aren't fond of sci-fi you should give Biting the Sun a chance.	2003-03-20

Their luck seems to improve because their new guardian, Montgomery Montgomery, is quite fond of the kids and even lets them help him with his snakes. Things take a turn for the worse when Count Olaf shows up in the guise of Uncle Monty's assistant and he only has one goal in mind, to get his paws on the Baudelaire fortune... at any cost. <br />This book doesn't really have anything new to add to the series and the plot of the first one was much more interesting. However, Lemony Snicket's brilliant way with words kept me laughing and Mr. Poe's idiocy kept me frustrated through out the book. Even though this book doesn't have much to it, it's still an enjoyable read and I look forward to reading the next in the series.	2003-03-20

Things start to look up when she finds a ransom note saying that her brother is alive. However, she only has to weeks to deliver the ransom and her Uncle Elliot refuses to pay. Catherine decides to take matters into her own hands with the help of her dog and her brother's friend, an ex-pirate named Derrick. <br />The romance in this book wasn't overly interesting but the fast paced, action filled plot makes up for that. There's plenty of robberies, kidnaping, and sea battles to satisfy thrill seekers. The characters are pretty likeable and even some of the secondary characters will catch your attention. All in all, Catherine and the Pirate is a fairly decent teen romance and it's worth a look if you are a fan of that genre.	2003-03-18

She has a successful career and a wonderful live in boyfriend. There's just one problem, Elena is a werewolf. When Jeremy, her pack alpha, calls for her help to fight a threat to the pack she quickly gets caught up with pack life again and her first love, Clay. Elena resents her life as a werewolf because it was forced upon her but as the threat to the pack worsens she begins to realize how important the pack is to her and how quickly it could all be taken away. <br />I've never been a big fan of werewolf novels but this one is an exception. Armstrong's werewolf ethos is simple and refreshingly cliche free. Her descriptions of werewolf thought and actions are feral without being so far removed from humanity that they become unbelievable. Elena is just the right mix of toughness and vulnerability and is someone you want to keep reading about. Clay is a wonderful character as well. He could have easily become a very pitiable character but Armstrong, thankfully, saves him from that fate. The writing is face paced and leaves you wanting more. Armstrong is certainly an author to watch and I'm sure I'll relentlessly hunt down and read all her future works.	2003-03-18

Based on the Harrison Ford/Julia Ormond move of the same name, Sabrina is the story of a girl who is in love with the rich, handsome, and seemingly unobtainable David Larrabee. Sabrina and David grew up together but he's barley aware that she exists because she doesn't compare to the beautiful and chic women David is use to. However, after a year in Paris, Sabrina comes home quite changed and David quickly becomes enamored with her. David soon forgets his new fiancé, Elizabeth, but his older brother Linus isn't so quick to forget, especially since Linus has business plans Elizabeth's father. Linus cooks up a scheme to tear David and Sabrina apart that will leave no one's feeling unscathed, even his own. <br />Sabrina is one of my favorite movies and the book captures the movie well. Sabrina's characterization is done well but the author didn't totally capture the sophistication of Julia Ormond's performance. On the other hand, her description of Linus was dead on. It's always interesting to see a movie you've watched many times from the eye of an author. Reading about thoughts and details that the movie didn't include were fun as well. Sabrina stands on it's own as a book and even people who haven't seen the movie should be able to enjoy it.	2003-03-12

However, she does not stay in her new home for long. When Corlath, the king of Damar, sees Harry he is compiled to Kidnap her and turn her into a warrior. Harry soon begins to feel as if she belongs in her new life and she accepts her destiny to protect Damar.<br />The Blue Sword is the sequel to The Hero and the Crown and I much preferred this book to it's prequel. Harry, like many of McKinley's heroines, is very likeable and Corlath is given much more development than McKinley's usual leading men. I really enjoyed the beginning of the book. Harry's adjustment to her new surroundings and her getting to know her kidnappers was very interesting. The book drags a bit in the middle but it quickly picks up the pace again and the end is satisfying. I don't really like McKinley's Damar series as much as some of her fairytale books but The Blue Sword is a great addition to any fantasy/romance fan's library.	2003-03-10

Her life seems perfect but she can't get the ship's captain, Jacob Carstairs, out of her head. Sure, Jacob is handsome and rich but he also teases Victoria relentlessly. Jacob also seems to distrust Victoria's new fiancé. So, which of these men is Victoria's true love and which is just a rogue?<br />I don't usually read romance books but since I enjoy teen novels I thought I'd give this one a try. Victoria and the Rogue isn't the most thought provoking book I've ever read but it was a more than adequate fun weekend read. Victoria is a bit judgmental but she means well so she not entirely unlikeable. Jacob was also pretty amusing. The ending vas very predictable but that didn't hinder my enjoyment of the book. I'll probably be reading more books from the Avon True Romance series.	2003-03-10

It's just a self help book but since this is Bridget Jones it's hardly serious. I liked this book. It was very amusing for the 10 minutes it took to read through it. Unfortunately, a lot of the book just rehashes what happened in the other two books. There is some new material however. I especially enjoyed the instructional photographs. My favorite part of the book is the section on the game &quot;Shag, marry or push off a cliff,&quot; which I've become addicted to playing. This book is a must read for Bridget Jones fans but it's not really worth buying.	2003-02-19

The first four stories are set in McKinley's Damar universe, the first three even feature Luthe. The last is a departure for her because it is set in modern times and doesn't have a very large fantasy element. <br />The Healer, is the story of a girl named Lilly who has the power to heal but is also mute. She meets a mage who can hear her telepathically and they set off on a journey to restore Lilly's speech. This is a fairly strong story and a great pick to start the book with. The characters are fleshed out well and the love story was enjoyable.<br />The Stagman, is about a princess named Ruen who is left, by her greedy uncle, as a sacrifice to a human/stag hybrid. Is the Stagman really as bad as people think he is? This is probably my favorite story in the collection. I liked all the characters and the plot was very interesting. It would have worked much better as a novel though. By the time the story was over there were still far to many unanswered questions. <br />Touk's House, is the story of a girl named Erana who was raised by a witch. As she grows up, she befriends and eventually falls in love with the witch's troll son. This is a fairly decent story. The plot is really interesting but it would have been much better if the characters had been developed a bit more. <br />Buttercups, is the story of a old farmer named Pos who marries a young girl named Coral. Pos loves his wife very much but has doubts about her affection for him because she spends too much time on buttercup hill. This is a cute story but it's, unfortunately, very boring.<br />A Knot in the Grain, is about a teenage girl named Annabelle who is forced to move away and leave behind her entire life. She finds little comfort in her new house but one day she discovers a secret compartment in her new bedroom. It was a great idea to make this the last in the collection because the tone is very different from the others. It's not a love story and it's not even really a fantasy story. What makes this story special is how authentic Annabelle's character is. McKinley captures the emotion that goes along with moving to a new place very well. <br />I'd recommend this book to people who are already fans of McKinley's work. You don't really need to be familiar with the Damar series to enjoy the stories but it certainly helps. I also feel that McKinley is better suited to longer stories. If you are looking to get into McKinley's work it'd be a good idea to start with Beauty or one of the Damar books.	2003-02-19

The Old Kingdom is not a friendly place however, the dead roam free and magic is the only way to survive. But how is a girl who just finished school suppose to track down her father in such a place? Even with the help of Mogget, a cat who is more then he appears, and Touchstone, a freshly revived swordsman and mage, the rescue mission still won't be smooth sailing. Something dead and powerful is after Sabriel and she must become an even greater necromancer than her father if she hopes to survive.<br />I adored the setting and magic system. The necromancy aspect in this book is the most interesting I've ever read about. The engrossing, fast paced plot makes this book a real page turner. This could have easily been a five star book if the characters had been more interesting. There was very little character development and what little there was came across as cold. Still, I probably will read some other books in this series, if only for the rich world that Garth Nix has created.	2003-01-07

Her mother was a foreigner and rumored to have been a witch and the country also fears Aerin may take after her. So, Aerin grows up not really having a place in the kingdom she loves but wanting to find a way to serve it. She knows that a life as a court lady isn't for her and she soon becomes interested in dragon slaying. She begins slaying small dragons but she soon discovers that an ancient giant dragon has awoken. <br />Although, I didn't really like this book as much as the other McKinley books I've read it's still a darn good book. Aerin is a heroin that you can get really attached to. The action in the book is terrific and action scenes usually bore me to tears. The romance scenes, though brief, are very touching. The reason I feel that this book doesn't quite measure up to McKinley's others is that the last third of the book is far too rushed. Aerin's strongest enemy seems to just come out of nowhere and the battle that results isn't nearly as interesting as the earlier battles. Also, it was not really explained in enough detail why the crown was so important. Another large problem was that Aerin's horse (not that I don't love that horse) was given more personality then either of her love interests. However, I still feel that the book deserves five stars because of the strength of it's heroine. Aerin really is one of the most endearing fantasy heroines I've ever come across.	2003-01-02

The kids must be sent to live with a relative and the vile Count Olaf seems to be the most handy one. But the Count hardly has the kids' best interests in mind and he cooks up a terrible scheme to get his hands on the kids' inheritance.<br />This is a pretty enjoyable book. With every horrible event that happened to the kids I found myself wondering how far the author would go. The kids themselves had cute little personalities and it was great to see them find ingenious ways to overcome their problems. I plan on reading the rest of the series if I can get them from the library. Ten bucks is a bit expensive for a book I can read in about an hour. Parents may want to consider buying them because kids will most likely want to read them many times.	2003-01-01

I don't even know where to start with listing all that is bad about it! The title character is as dull as she is annoying and the tie in with the Mayfair witches is just a lame publicity stunt. All of the returning characters are twisted till they are unrecognizable. David is turned from a refined British gentleman who just happens to be gay to a perverted molester of little girls. Lestst (yes he is in the book) seemed in character at first but that didn't last long. He was way too accepting of events. If any of this stuff had happened around the real Lestat he would have thrown a big temper tantrum and started incinerating things. I don't want to reveal too much about Claudia but I will say that something happens with her that will forever taint Interview With the Vampire And worst of all is Louis. I'm not buying him and Merrick as a couple to say the least. However,  there are a few things that I enjoyed about this book. Very few. My favorite part of the book is when Louis is telling David about the daguerreotype that was taken of Claudia before she died. That scene just rang true for me. A few of the other Louis/David scenes had merit too...... just not much. Avoid this books at all costs!!	2002-12-29

She lives in the woods for months not remembering her past but knowing something awful happened to her. One day she goes to a city and falls for the prince who sent her Ash but she cannot get over her past.<br />This is a much more adult fairytale than McKinley's other works but it is also a more realistic one. It deals with deep psychological pain and love isn't a cure for everything. It's also not a book for everyone. If themes of incest and rape bother you then you should avoid this book. I'm not saying that this book is a completely sad one though. The sad beginning makes the happy moments and the journey to get there very satisfying. This is the best book I've read in a while and any fairytale fan is sure to enjoy it.	2002-12-24

There she must investigate a vampire hating organization, The Fellowship of the Sun. Meanwhile, back in Sookie's hometown, one of her co-workers has been murdered and a cop has been framed.<br />This actually feels like two books in one even though it's not a long book. The story in the beginning and the end of the book is almost completely separate from the middle. This doesn't really hurt the enjoyment of the book though. I found this book to be less enjoyable then the first because Sookie gets the stuffing beat out of her all the time. It gets annoying after a while. The best thing about this book are the bits of Bill's past and Eric's expanded role. All in all there's more action and less romance. Not quite as enjoyable as the first but still a great read.	2002-12-23

I decided to pick it up because Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series amuses me greatly. Fans of that series will surely enjoy this book. There isn't as much action as the Stephanie Plum series but the same wacky humor is still there. Besides, Nick's mad genius cousin, Max, is so very adorable.	2002-12-16

Usually explanations of magic bore me to tears but I found this one to be just as addicting as the rest of the book. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the ending. It was very rushed but at least it didn't make me want to bang my head against the wall like all the other Lackey endings I've read. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this book. Before you buy it check to make sure the cover is firmly attached if you can. Mine fell clean off before I was even through the first 100 pages.

Most of the book focuses on what happens to the Beast before he finds the enchanted castle and meets Belle. Another interesting twist to this version is that the Beast is transformed into a lion instead of a man-beast creature. The Beast's dual nature is still there in that he thinks like a man but has the instincts of a lion. He even attempts to live as a lion but when that fails he realizes he must try to lift his curse. This is where Belle finally comes in. I really like Belle in this book. She's a lot more strong willed than the other Beauties I've read about. Beauty and the Beast's relationship develops in an fascinating way because the Beast can't talk. I also love the cute little fox they keep as a pet. If you are looking for a pure romance book this one will probably be a let down. Otherwise, pick it up!	2002-12-16

Finally a book where the man has to stay a virgin to gain the holy super magical power. Ha! I laugh in his face! Of course the virgin rule doesn't seem to include having sex with other men. ^_^ Anyway, the main character, Roddy, is a bit of a brat but I like him anyway. I certainly don't feel the deep hatred for him that most people feel. Actually, I think the most annoying thing about him is his straightness. He really needs to get over that....... Just kidding. ^_^ One of the best things about this book is how realistic the characters are. Roddy is certainly not your typical fantasy hero. The supporting cast are all very lifelike as well.<br />The slash in this book is pretty tame and doesn't take up a huge chunk of the plot so non slash fans should still enjoy it. But for all you hard core slash fans the story is interesting enough you hardly even notice the lack of slash. I really love how the story focuses on the political more than the magical aspects of Roddy's quest to be king. Magic is all well and good, but a big problem in many fantasy books is that the plot is almost entirely made up of the various magical rules. I find that sort of thing dull but that is never a problem in this book. The book also moves at a good pace. I don't feel things are rushed or prolonged at all.<br />The only thing that I really didn't like about this book is how abrupt the ending is. I really hope there's a sequel in the works. If not I might have to tie David Feintuch to his computer and make him write one............. kidding again.<br />I think this is may favorite fantasy novel besides the Nightrunner series by Lynn Flewelling. Even if fantasy and slash aren't your favorite genres you should still pick up a copy of this book.	2002-12-16

Although I liked Beauty's character better in McKinley's first novel I prefer this book to the original. Both books are wonderful but the plot and most of the characters are far more fleshed out in this book. Beauty's sisters have a lot of personality compared to the first book, when they were just nice and pretty. I also like the Beast better. His history is interesting and he even has a cute little hobby. The plot focuses on the magic as much at if focuses on the characters and the romance which makes for much more exciting reading than the original. I really love the ending of this book for a change. The one thing that's always annoyed me about the Beauty and the Beast tale is the ending but that's all I'm going to say about that. I don't want to give the ending away. I'm sure this is a book I'm going to read many times. Buy this book people!	2002-12-16

When I first saw that episode I thought it was pretty dull and that the techno-mages were kind of [weak] but the other day I found myself yelling at my brother for saying pretty much the same thing I just did. This book certainly adds new depths to that episode although, hard core Londo fans might want to avoid it. It really doesn't paint a pretty picture of him. <br />Meanwhile, Galen and Blaylock head off to a shadow base to gather information but Galen is also after revenge. Galen has really changed since the first book. He's pretty [angry] and he's not dealing with it very well. This is the Galen we saw in the Crusade episode The Path of Sorrows.

Galen's character was so on that I felt as if I was watching an episode of Crusade. Galen isn't the only character you'll find from the Babylon 5/Crusade universe; Morden, Kosh, Anna Sheridan, Isabelle, Elric, and Alwyn also appear. You don't have to be familiar with the B5/Crusade universe to enjoy this book though. This is one of the best science-fiction pieces I've ever read. It was especially interesting to learn about the order of the techno-mages and to see the start of the Shadow war from their perspective.

Girls are being killed and Sookie's ho brother is the prime suspect. <br />I like this series a lot. Sookie's a fun character and there's enough interesting characters to keep this series going for a long time. There's a bit more emphasis on romance then there is on action but that works well for this series. I finished this book at work and I wanted the next one so bad I left work early and drove in scary traffic to get it. I had 2 almost accidents but it was so worth it.	2002-12-16

She is the twin sister to the Dragon Heir, Valraven. This part of the book is pretty dark. It's full of incest and jealousy which was fairly amusing but I didn't really get hooked till the second half of the book. In the second part, the POV shifts to a recently married Madragore princess named Varencienne. As she comes to know the characters from the first part of the book the mysteries of the sea dragon begin to unravel. <br />I wasn't overly fond of any of the characters but I liked them all ok. The plot was interesting enough that I didn't really mind. I do look forward to learning more about some of the side characters in the second book, Crown of Silence, which I would be ordering now if I weren't broke.	2002-12-16

Three strangers meet up and set out on a quest to retrieve a stolen magical object. What made this book enjoyable was the three main characters. Aaron is a runaway prince turned thief. Darvish is a drunken prince who turns out to be a pretty decent guy after he drys up a bit. Chandra is a princess who's not happy about her betrothal to Darvish because all she wants to do is wizard about. The characters are all pretty likeable and well developed for such a small book. If you are looking for a decent but light fantasy story with a bit of slash thrown in then this is a good choice.	2002-12-16

On one hand, the main characters are fairly well fleshed out for such a short book. On the other hand, the book does seem a bit directionless. Oh well everyone on amazon seems to love it so maybe I'm missing something. Anyway, If you are looking for a quick slashy read that is touching one minute and terrifying the next then this book is a good pick.	2002-12-16

It has pretty much the same plot that we are familiar with, which is probably because Disney lifted much of Belle's character from the `Beauty' in this book. Beauty (which is just a nickname, her real name is Honour), her two elder sisters, and her Father are forced to move to a small town after the Father's shipping business goes under. After the family adjusts to poor country living they run into a problem. The father wanders into the Beast's castle and steals a rose to bring home to Beauty. This angers the Beast and he tells the father that he must send one of his daughters to live with the Beast or the Beast will kill him. When the Father returns home and tell his tale to his daughters Beauty knows that she must be the one to go. Beauty then goes to the Beast's castle and gets to know him and eventually love him. <br />This thing that makes this book truly special is the character Beauty. Her bookish and tomboyish ways make her endearing. The book is intended for 9-12 year Olds but don't let that stop you from reading it. It is easily enjoyed by fairy tale loving adults. ... Anyway, If you are looking for an excellent fairy tale retelling or just a book to read to your kids then this book is a terrific pick.	2002-12-16

Well there's not much I can say about this book that I haven't said about the first two. I love this series, I love this book, and I love Galen. That pretty much sums it up. Because of these books I'll never be able to watch Crusade or Babylon 5 in quite the same way. Man I wish there were more of this series.	2002-12-16

I had seen the first movie a few years back but I didn't really remember much about it other than thinking that it was ok. Being the huge Poppy Z. Brite fan that I am I, of course, had to read this book. I was a bit disappointed by it though. Poppy's writing style is as wonderfully descriptive as ever but the plot was very inconsistent. <br />I felt that the main character, Jared, wasn't given nearly enough character development needed to make me care about him. I would have loved to hear more about his past with the twins. Another character, Frank, had great character development but he barely figured into the rest of the book. The killer could have used more character development as well. If we had learned more about what drives him, like with Jay and Andrew in Poppy's previous novel Exquisite Corpse, it would have made the main plot a lot more interesting. <br />All in all, I found the main plot of the book to be pretty dull but a few of the back stories made this book wort reading. My favorite part was the chapter when we were introduced to Frank. I found the events that happened with him and his ex partner to be particularly memorable. I was really disappointed that he wasn't in the book more. I also enjoyed the back story of the twins. That would have made a terrific short story.<br />I'd recommend this book to hardcore fans of Poppy and/or The Crow but if you are looking to get into Poppy's writing, I suggest you start with Lost Souls, Drawing Blood, or one of her short story collections if you are a fan of short stories.	2001-11-03
US	50588074	R3Q5W4HUWKTXBE	0786886463	711918396	A Density of Souls	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Not bad for a first novel	Ok, the big uproar about this book is that people think it was only published because his mother is Anne Rice. It's probably true. How many people get published that young? Anyway, who cares? It's a decent novel and people should just shut up about his mother. I'm also not gonna compare him to her in this review. Another thing people just can't seem to shut up about is that they think the main character, Stephen, is Christopher Rice. I can't help but think that people say this because he is gay. I don't really care if it's true. Many other writers do the same thing and Stephen is developed well enough that it doesn't matter. <br />Now that I've cleared that up here's the actual review. I liked this book. It's not the best book I've ever read but it's far above average. Christopher Rice's style is descriptive with out getting stale and it has just a touch of gothic. I also liked most of the characters. Usually in books that switch POVs there are a few characters that bore me to tears but I didn't really have that with this book. A few of them could have been developed a little better though. The plot was also interesting enough to hold my interest through out the whole book but it can be a bit jumbled in places. There were also a few typos. If he used an editor they need to get smacked. My favorite scene is when Stephen's boyfriend breaks up with him because Stephen didn't share his dots with him when they went to see a move. So then Stephen buys a huge box of dots and leaves them on his door. There are more dramatic scenes in the book but that one is just so funny and cute I can't help loving it. <br />Overall this is a good first novel. Christopher has all the makings of a great writer. His skills just need to be polished a bit. Slash (male/male or female/female sexual relations. In this case male/male) fans should enjoy this book a lot. If you aren't a slash fan you might not like it too much but it is still worth reading. I'm defiantly going to buy his new novelwhen it comes out in February. Hopefully it'll be even better than this one.	2001-11-02
US	50588074	R2LDKEW0TGHRTE	0425181685	449119181	Narcissus in Chains (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 10)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Too much sex, not enough plot.	I was really disappointed by this book. There was too much sex and not enough plot. The many new characters that are introduced are very one dimensional. What there was of the plot was pretty boring. But the worst thing of all about this book is that Anita's personality changed so much she's practically unrecognizable. <br />This ardeur thing that Anita picks up from Jean-Claude when she mergers the marks with him and Richard is just a cheep plot device that attempts to make it alright for Anita to screw nearly every guy she comes across. Now I'm not one of those people that thinks Anita has to stay as sexually repressed as she was in the first few books. It's important for her character to overcome that aspect of herself but this was just way too much. She does half the make cast........ practically at the same time. I'm also not one of those people who is dead set against Anita dating someone other than Jean-Cladue or Richard (or Edward). Micah (Anita's new love interest) could have been interesting if he had been given some character development but all the sex got in the way of that too.<br />There are some good things about this book though. I think my favorite parts were the scenes between Anita and Dolf (who she didn't screw thank God) I've been looking forward to the tension between them being explored ever since he discovered she was dating JC in The Killing Dance and I haven't been disappointed so far. Another good thing is how Nathaniel was handled. He's finally growing a back bone! I also liked the Damian sub plot and I hope that is developed further in future books. The JC and Asher tidbits were nice as well. Oh and for all you Gretchen fans (are there Gretchen fans?) you finally get to find out what happens to her.<br />Unfortunately, this is the worse book in the Anita Blake series and I hope they don't continue to go down hill. It would be a real shame if this series was twisted till it's unrecognizable like Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. I don't really feel comfortable recommending you buy this book. Anita Blake fans should just borrow it form the library and form their own opinions.	2001-11-01
