This book has great coverage on propagation, cultivation, identification and collecting. I like the decision to leave out mushrooms of unknown edibility because  it makes the book much more manageable. <br />The photography is excellent. I liked the addition of habitat shots of where certain mushrooms grow. This would surely help anyone who is a collector.  <br />This book stayed on track and didn't try to be all things to all people. For instance, in the cultivation section, they tell you what to read for more information depending on the type of mushroom.  <br />This book has great information on all levels and is helpful guide for the novice to expert gardener.	2004-12-08

So, it has just enough background information so that the gardener has a good foundation. Even I got a bit lost in the groups section, but it becomes clearer as you get more into the book.  I would have liked to see some shots about propagation, planting, training, and pruning, especially in a growing guide, but overall the descriptions and the book as a whole is great.  <br />This is not a book for the complete novice, but for the intermediate to advanced gardener.	2004-12-06

Infact after reading it I don't think the authors even grow the plants it is treated as more of an object than a plant. this was made worse by no color photos just illustrations. now don't get me wrong they were nice illustrations. but would it have killed you to include some photos.
