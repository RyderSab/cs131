As Tracy tells us, he was quite a problem in his younger years, dropped out of high school and with no education was relegated to low paying deadend jobs.<br />But then something changed in Tracy. He went into straight commission selling seeing an opportunity to write his own paycheck and met some very successful salesmen. He learned how to sell and sell well, but more importantly, he learned the miracle of personal development. He went to work on himself and the rest as they say is history.<br />In MAXIMUM ACHIEVEMENT, Brian Tracy will show you everything you need to make rapid advances in your life. Personally, socially, with your career, in relationships and more.<br />I remember when Amazon used to give ten stars. If they were still doing that MAXIMUM ACHIEVEMENT would be a true 10 star book. And there are not many books that I would say that about.<br />MAXIMUM ACHIEVEMENT is Brian Tracy's best work.	2004-07-11

A  millionaire once said that the way to become rich is to take a millionaire out to lunch and pick his brain. Take a millionaire out to lunch and pay for it.

If  you want the wisdom of the super wealthy, pay for it.<br />The other day I was at BAMM and took Donald Trump to lunch via his book and previewed while eating lunch at Joe Muggs cafe.

In fact that was what persuaded us to buy the book and go to work. Hard to believe that people could become debt free millionaires on an income that was equal to ours.<br />The first thing we did was forget the word budget and simply pay ourselves first. We then automated our financial lives by selecting direct deposit for our payroll checks and automatically  having our first 10% deposited into a no load mutual fund.<br />We then revamped our mortgage and began, just like Jim and Sue to make two monthly payments instead of one. On those months when got got paid  three times in a month, we make three mortgage payments. Unbeliveable how much faster oour mortgage is bing paid off thanks to this strategy. Geez, I wonder why our bankers never told us this?<br />We had some credit card debt especially after Christmas and began using the same strategy to our cards. We thought it would take most of the year to pay the cards off. No so. They are already paid off!<br />Following Jim and Sue's example we are planning on renting out our home as soon as it is paid off and then buying a new one. The rent payments recieved from this home will help us pay off our new mortgage in record time.<br />When I first read this book I was taken back by it's simplicity and had to ask myself over and over if it was this simple, how come we never heard about this before and how come everybody isn't doing it?<br />Good questions!<br />Perhaps too many have been JBQ'ed to poverty!<br />I was also excited to see that credible financial people like Jean Chatzky, Cnadace Bahr, Ginita Wall and Robert Kiyosaki all recommend this book in addition to other highly credible business people like Brian Tracy, Ken Blanchard, and Bill O'Reilly.<br />Overall, The Automatic Millionaire is a great book that will make a tremendous difference in your financial  life. It has already made a tremendous difference in our lives and we have only just begun. We look forward to being up there with Jim and Sue, hopefully in even less time.<br />Thank you Mr. BACH!	2004-04-10

Multiple Streams of Income is a very powerful book with lots of information to take you where ever you want to go. I bought the hardback copy about 4 years ago and was quite impressed to have made money in mutuals while just about everybodyelse lost money.<br />I have been using the Pro Funds Ultra and Short Funds switching back and forth based on moving average indicators. I have also used the Cooper Covered Call Strategy and option strategy covered in this book and have continued to make money since 2000 while the market averages as a whole have been down.<br />In addition, I have also used the  tax lien stratgy both to invest in tax liens and to buy real estate property for literally pennies on the dollar.<br />Network marketing? Just check out the stock performance of USANA to determine how powerful this concept is and how well network ma rketing companies have been doing while other industries are shutting down. If you think USANA was a fluke then check out Nu Skin, Natures Bounty or other publicly traded MLM companies. Network marketing has exploded while other industries have imploded. Folks, MLM works and once again Robert Allen was absolutely correct in promoting this concept way back before the fact.<br />Interesting that Allen is always disputed and always prooves his detracters wrong. Thank you Robert. I let  my ex boss and all the people I used to work with when I used to work a J-O-B how much I don't miss that RUT and how much I  LOVE the FREEDOM that I now enjoy.<br />Multiple Streams of Income is a very powerful book if used and applied.	2004-04-10

Carnegies ideas worked 70 years ago and they work today. Why? People are the same. We all have the same needs, wants, desires and dreams that we had 70 years ago. The core hasn't changed. So that makes this book even more valuable today, now than ever.<br />Also, take a look at what is going on in the world. If even there was a time when people needed people skills it is now. Take a look at the Democrat Party. If ever there was a group that needed people skills, it is there.<br />If I had to pick out just one  point that is the most important in this book it is being genuinely interested in the other person. In fact, I think a lot of reviewers here on this board can take a clue from that one.<br />How To Win Friends and Influence People is a fantastic book---more valuable now than ever.<br />Buy it - read it - use it.	2004-03-27

Fans of 1,000 page+ fluffy books written by magazine authors with no financial credentials will not like this book.

The get rich quickies won't enjoy this book either.<br />If you are like me and are looking for a proven program that really works and has been explicitly researched, then this book is for you.<br />Tony Robbins talks about modeling. If youw ant to be rich, doesn't it make sense to model the rich? This book and The Millionaire Mind shows you how the rich think and how they become rich.<br />And unlike some other books, there is no fluff here.

Books	5	115	125	N	N	Rich Dad Poor Dad is unbelievable!	I cannot believe the powerful benefits of following the Rich Dad Philosophy. Before reading RDPD, I too was a member of the rat race and feeling like a rat. I really believed that my house was an asset and felt lucky to be working and was grateful for my college education.<br />When my company became a victim of a hostile takeover and m assive downsizing insued, I became aware of what Rich Dad taught Robert Kiyosaki so many years ago. Although I had heard about this book before, I dismissed it as &quot;get rich quick&quot; quackery appropiate for the naive. I had been to college. To smart for this junk, or so I thought.<br />Then I was downsized and hit the streets with my resume. While waiting for employers to call me, I took the time to read Rich Dad Poor Dad. I hated it at first and even though it was so small, it took me an inordinate amount of time to read the book.<br />After being turned down time after time after time for jobs, I decided to pour into RDPD after seeing Mr. Kiyosaki on tv. To wit, I also went out and bought Cashflow Quadrant and Rich Dad Success Stories.<br />Out of curiosity, I called a few real estate ads for homes for sale in my area and found plenty of &quot;don't wanters.&quot; I also found several business opportunities including network marketing.<br />I jumped on an opportunity to take over a business on lease purchase deal with nothing down. I also became a landlord buying a home with nothing down. I am still considering that network marketing opportunity.<br />Best of all, one of the companies that I applied for a job with called me offering me a position with their company and I happily told them that I didn't need their job and I had found the perfect boss. When they asked me who I was working for I said &quot;Myself!&quot; and went on to tell them that I would never work for a employer again.<br />I am happier and more content than I have been in years. To fully appreciate the value of Rich Dad's advice, pick up a copy of Rich DadPoor Dad and Rich Dad's Success Stories. I also recommend Kiyosaki's Rich Dad Poor Dad website.<br />Kiyosaki changed my life. Previously I was discouraged and frustrated hopelessly depending on a company to take care of me. Now I realize that nobody will take care of me better than I will.<br />Rich Dad Poor Dad started it all for me. Thank you Rich Dad! Thank you Mr. Kiyosaki!	2004-03-11

At that time, I was in a direct sales company and had the good fortune to attend a seminar conducted by a businessman named Jim Rohn.<br />Mr. Rohn talked about his early mentor, a man named Earl Schoff and went on to tell us how Mr. Schoff turned him on to personal development and pointed him to the right books to read. One of the most important books, said Rohn was The Richest Man in Bablyon.<br />Rohn had made and lost a fortune but came back and made another fortune and gave credit to the principles in The Richest Man in Bablyon for helping him accomplish that feat.<br />I read The Richest Man in Bablyon and have to admit, I hated it! I thought it was stupid, like feel good stuff that has no substance. When ever friends came over, I hid the book. I felt so ridiculous.<br />But Mr. Rohns words of wisdom kept echeoing in my mind. So I read it over and over untill the principles were imbedded into my conscious and subconsious mind.<br />Soon, after the fifth reading, the the principles became habits for me. My wealth esculated at a very rapid rate. I was no longer wasting money. I was now investing the first 10% of my income, tithing 10% and investing another 10% in capital like no load mutuals, real estate, discounted mortgages, tax liens and my own business.<br />The Richest Man in Bablyon has 7 basic principles:<br />1) Start thy purse to fattening - save/invest<br />2) Control thy expenditures - watch out for self serving brokers<br />3) Make thy gold mutiply - use powerful investments<br />4) Guard thy treasures from loss - watch out for brokers with<br />their hot tips.<br />5) Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment - rental properties, your own home---but stay within your means.<br />6) Insure a future income - do work that you love to do.

Books	5	65	75	N	N	Awaken The Giant is a powerful book	I first saw Anthony Robbins many years ago on the Joan Rivers show along with Charles Givens. Both were talking about success and  hawking their respective books; Awaken The Giant and More Wealth Without Risk.<br />What impressed me about Awaken The Giant is that it is not just &quot;feel good&quot; stuff that gives a puffy, artificial high. Tony Robbins offers real meaty advice that works and works right away.<br />NAC or NLP offers fast and permanent change. I had a stuttering problem. After using Tony's methods--gone. Not in months or weeks but right away.<br />I also had a fear of public speaking. When my manager called upon me to speak to our group, I was petrified initially. But after following Tony's advice, using swish patterns and installing anchors, the fear was  gone and everyone complimented me on my performance. <br />It didn't take weeks, it took one application.<br />Since then, I have been able to flatten my fears, overcome lifelong phobias e.g. fear of snakes and public speaking. I have made rapid and permanent changes.<br />Awaken The Giant is a great book. It will unleash the giant sleeping inside of you and h elp you reach whatever goals you can realistically set and go for.<br />I also recommend More Wealth Without Risk, a book that does for personal finance what Awaken The Giant does for you on a personal development level and also SuperSelf, another great book by Charles Givens that offers personal development strategies different from what is in Tony Robbins book.	2004-03-04

In this book, Suze gets inside your head and uncovers the real reasons why you are not where you want to be financially.<br />Suze explains why your ideas about money and in particular, your feelings regarding your personal experiences with money play a major role in what you do with money in the future.<br />A lot of people got wallopped in the stock market over the last three years. This is unfortunate as there are strategies that could have helped these  people make omney while the markets went down. Back to the point of Suzes book, many people are now gun shy of the markets and afriad to invest. Big mistake!<br />The same is true with other areas of personal finance. Some have gone over their heads in credit cards debt and now look at anything plastic with a phobic-like reaction. Others have lost their homes in foreclosure and many have gone bankrupt. Too many others are living high while investing less and less. Contributions to 401 (k) savings plans has decreased and only in January of 2004 has investing in stock mutual funds started to rise.<br />Too many people are missing out on opportunity. Suze's book will  help break that phobia and achieve the results you want.<br />Fans of 1,000 page boring and out-of-date financial books written by financial authors may not like this book by Suze but I have a question for you: how is the advice that you recieved from that magazine author working for you? I rest my case!<br />Suze may not be the greatest writer in the world but she is the best financial advisor/author right now. She is genuinely passionate about personal finance and not just trying to catch the wave of personal finance interest and jump on the bandwagon of Venita Van Caspel, Charles Givens, Terry Savage, or now Suze Orman like another personal finance author.<br />The Laws of Money is a great book that can and will make a significant differnce in your financial life.	2004-02-29

I actually gained more than that.<br />Like most people, I assumed all there was to time management was to get a Daytimer, set up a To Do list etc. No wonder I never got anywhere! Brian has an easy to follow system that is based on over 20 years of research....and his system really works.<br />Why a book just on Time Management? As Brian explains in Time Power, those who get more done in less time get more out of life....more rewards, more success, and more free time to pursue their dreams and enjoy themselves.<br />The fact of the matter is, as Brian Tracy says, &quot;The quality of your life is largely determined by the quality of your time management.&quot;<br />For many people, getting organized is a real chore. Not if you follow Tracy's dynamic system. In Time Power, you will find that you don't have to be cold and calculating to be well organized. Time power does  not mean letting the clock rule your life. In fact the opposite is true. : time power gives you absolute freedom to do what you want, when you want to do it, ironically, you even learn to make time for spontaneity. The more time you make for yourself, the more free time you have.<br />Unlike many programs and books on time management, Time Power has no charts, no forms, no dailty schedules. Brian Tracy believes in them but knows that you are quite capable of developing them for yourself. His purpose in this book is to teach you the philosophy of time management, to help you internalize it,a nd to help you develop a belief system that will m ake your every moment very efficient.<br />Time Power is the result of over 20 years of experience---of research and teaching with more than 200 corporations. The program was designed to give you everything you need yo know about mastering your time for your personal life and career.<br />Tracy will show you how to  become excellent at time management...to concentrate on the highest payoff tasks. Your life will simply begin to work better.<br />After following the advice in Time Power including the many exercises, you will learn to:<br />* Use positive self talk and affirmations <BR>* Change your self concepts about time<BR>* Use powerful  mental rehearsal techniques<BR>* Model your own behavior after time management leaders<BR>* Learn to lead others <BR>* Become results oriented<BR>* Learn to work smarter, not harder<BR>* Delegate more effectively<BR>* Become more adept at prioritizing<BR>* Energize yourself with the positive results of your labor<br />By using the techniques in Time Power, you'll greatly improve the sense of control you have and in turn improve your well being in every aspect of your life. I know it's working for me.<br />Time is indeed your most precious and perishable asset. You can begin investing it more wisely by reading Time Power, doing the exercises and putting this time tested wisdom to use.<br />I have read many books, listened to many tape programs and even attended seminars on time management. Time Power is the most results driven program that I have ever used. <br />Use it. It will make a major difference in your personal and professional life.	2004-02-29

It is written in an encyclopedic way. An easy reference guide for anyone.<br />I found the paperback so beneficial that I bought additional copies for my son and daughter-in-law to enjoy.<br />The Road To Wealth is a great book, possibly the best financial book on the bookstands right now.<br />I also recommend Suze's newest book, The Laws of Money. The Lessons of Life. Suze goes beyond just money management and helps people understand the mental side of handling money. While I don't agree with everything she says, Suze is the best female personal finance author out there right now. Certaintly much better than Jane Bryant Quinn.	2004-02-29

Suze Orman is undoubtably the m ost read, most listened to and most passionate financial author/advisor right now.<br />She is also the most credible and most knowledgeable, especially among the female sector. A close second would be Jean Chastby or Terry Savage.<br />Suze really pounds the credit card dilemna. It is unfortunate that so many companies induce the naive and get them suckered into credit card deals. Many credit cards companies are using &quot;bait and switch&quot; type techniques and  getting consumers into such debt, that to pay off their credit card debt requires years and so much money that they could  have bought a home!<br />Some companies like Bank One are using a gimmick called &quot;repricing&quot; and 2 cycle billing. These people really need Suzes advice.<br />Suze also recommends a 15 year mortgage in place of a 30 year mortgage and I agree. You pay so much more in interest with a 30 year mortgage. Likewise for auto loans. Many bank officers will have you take out a 60 month loan because the lower payments are so appealing. Wrong! Take out a 24 month or 30 month loan and save thosands for your next car purchase. Also, buy a car used rather than new and invest the difference.<br />Suze also makes a strong case against cash value type insurance products and recommends term instead. Again, I agree. Especially as I use to sell insurance and know the drill. CASH VALUE insurance products are essentially better for the insurance salesman, not the consumer.<br />Suze recommend no-load mutual funds and a gain I have to agree. Average investors have no business playing the stock market and statistics show that most investors lose money. Despite the recent mutual fund scandal, mutuals are still the best place for  most. And unlike Quinn, Suze does explain that even no-loads carry a maintenance fee.<br />Suze is big on index funds. At the time this book was written, that was not thebest advice as the markets tanked in 2000 when the Clinton/Gore bubble bursted. And with index funds, when the market goes down, well...just run a chart on index funds from 1999 to 2004. Even with the big move up since October 2003, these funds are still in negative territory.<br />Overall a good book. A great start for anyone interested in money management. Suze's mind-to-money concept is great and the best part of this book.<br />I would also recommend Suze's other books, The Road To Wealth, The Laws of Money and The Courage To Be Rich. In addition, readers will find great advice on investing in More Wealth Without Risk by Charles Givens and Ric Edelmans new book, The Truth About Money.<br />If you are having credit problems and feel you have been scamned, check out To Pay or Not To Pay. <br />Suze great boo.

It reminds me of Allens excellent book &quot;The Challenge&quot;, how Allen took three people straight out of the unemployment lines. People who were broke and frustrated and showed them how to earn $5,000 in real estate in three months. <br />So the fictional part is no really so fictional at all.

My first encounter with Mike Mentzer was back in 1971 at the AAU Mr. Pennsylvania contest in Norristown, Pa. When announcer Dave Mayor said;&quot;Our final contestant is from Ephrata, Pa. and is the current AAU Mr. Lancaster County. This is only his second competition so give him a break.&quot;The audience was somber faced and politely clapped expecting to see a average state caliber bodybuilder. Out walks Mentzer and the audience goes absolutely wild. Mike was a very easy winner here and said he was going to give Casey (Viator) a run for his money the very next month in the AAU Mr. America and would win both the Mr. America and Mr. Universe within three years and the Mr. Olympia by 1976.In 1971, Mike attributed his success to being blessed with exceptional genetics and D-bol also know as Dianabol. He said he trained pretty like the average bodybuilder (in 1971)I trained with Mike Mentzer in 1977 prior to the Jr Mr. America contest. He trained then pretty much like a average bodybuilder. although he was hawking the HIT system and Nautilus.I have used the Mentzer system. It's okay to break training boredom and you do get strong really quick and a great workout. But you can't stay on it for long. I agree with the last message in which the bodybuiklder said he lost his lines using HIT. I find that I need to hit certain sections of a bodypart to bring it out. Just as aerobic exercise brings out cuts and veins as a result of reduced bodyfat BUT only with training, the HIT system only works if done in conjunction with regular, conventional exercises.Mike was a great champion and when I knew him, was a really nice guy. Very congenial. I still remember him walking out on that stage in Norristown, Pa. and thinking to myself, here is a future great. And I remember the sparkle in Mike's eyes, then a total unknown as he said, &quot;I'm going to take on Casey Viator at the AAU Mr. America next month and push him to the hilt!&quot;Mike was a great champion and a nice guy. Just don't take his HIT system too seriously.	2001-09-30

I tried the Mentzer sytem for 8 weeks. Initially I made impressive gains, especially in strength. And it was great to get in and out of the gym quickly. But alas, I was burned out at the end of the 8 weeks and lost the lines that I had worked for. I would recommend this system only as break from regular training, not as a substitute. And you can't bring out the striations and lines on only a few sets and limited exercises unless you are a genetic freak and on the juice like Mike was.Sorry to hear about Mike's passing. He was a true icon for sure. Perhaps, and I say this respectfully, his passing is a message for the rest of us. Stay away from the juice and follow a more sensible,  healthy training program.Use this with caution, if you use it at all.	2001-09-07

While I have a library of many self help books, I really wish I would have heard about this one much sooner.Chapter 7-Transforming Your Beliefs was particularly useful to me. I was actually at a point where I felt guilty about making more money than relatives and friends. A belief I had to transform was that it's okay to make more money. It's okay to  be better. The affirmations; My beliefs create good things for me and I deserve abundance were very useful for me. I now give more to charities and my church. The more I make, the more I share.I come from a small town in  Pennsylvania and was brought up on lack and limitations. We always had a home, groceries and clothes. But there was never any money for anythingelse. My Mothers favorite comments were; &quot;We can't afford it&quot; or &quot;It's too expensive&quot;. For a long time I maintained the same attitude; too expensive, can't afford it. By changing my beliefs, establishing new goals and aligning them with values, my net worth exploded as my self worth increased. This book helped me create a new belief system. I also enjoyed Chapter 4 and chapter 12. I also recommend 9 Steps to Financial Freedom and Courage to be rich by Suze Orman and Business Buy the Bible and Don't set Goals [The old way] by Wade Cook.Sanaya Roman and Duane Packer have written a excellent book. Creating Mony does contain the Keys to Abundance.Great book.	2001-03-15
