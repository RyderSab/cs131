This spree, committed by black members of an offshoot of the Muslim religion, was done in an attempt for the murderers to win &quot;Death Angel&quot; status.  This dubious honor was given to any &quot;true believer&quot; who murdered a certain number of white children, white women, or white men, or a combination of the three.  (One received more credit for slaying a child or woman than a man supposedly because it would take more fortitude to do it.  However, the author believes [with good reason, I think] it had more to do with the murderers being cowards afraid of anyone who might fight back.)  Taking place over several months, the killers took several lives and wounded others in their barbaric attempt to win Death Angel wings.  The author does a splendid job in recreating the events as well as allowing the reader to get inside the head of the people who actually believed it to be an honor to murder others.  What is even more chilling than the specific Zebra murders is the fact that other Death Angels supposedly existed in California and could be walking the streets even today.  For those with a strong stomach wishing to find out about a savage wave of crime (a wave that has strangely been forgotten), this is a must read.	2004-01-14

His book proports to give away secrets of these infamous men but for the most part it only gives impressions that the author and other staff had.  He does make a compelling case that Hitler had Parkinson's Disease but his claim that this is what caused Hitler's infamous blunders of WWII (such as invading the USSR) is highly debatable at best.  The book's true value (and the reason I gave it 3 stars) lies in the photos of the massive collection of Nazi artifacts the author gathered.  From Hitler's darned socks to Ribbentrop's medals, any WWII buff or collector will be impressed with Mr. Lattimer's collection.<br />In conclusion, if you want to see photos of items that once belonged to top Nazis like napkins Hitler used, then pick up this book.  If you want an in-depth analysis of the infamous Nazi leadership and the secrets they had, this isn't the book for you.	2003-04-03

This idea was that the USSR was bound to collapse and that certainly Ronald Reagan had nothing to do with.  This book demolishes that myth and sets the record straight once and for all with a mountain of documentation, much of which came from the former Soviet Union.  <br />&quot;Reagan's War&quot; traces the formation of Ronald Reagan's anti-communist character and his rise to political power.  It then shows the sharp break Reagan's administration had with prior presidencies concerned with containment and detente.  Far from wishing to coexist, Reagan believed that confrontation was the key to destroying the USSR.  And confront he did from aiding anti-communist guerrilla bands around the world, to toppling Grenada's government, to aiding the Polish solidarity movement, to embarking on the biggest peacetime military build-up in US history, to starting the fledgling SDI program (aka &quot;Star Wars&quot;).  This book lists the shock waves that such actions produced in the Soviet Union as well as how they eventually pushed the USSR to oblivion.  <br />This book is a must for anyone interested in the fall of the Soviet Union or the Reagan legacy.	2003-03-15

Wells which depicts a horrifying invasion of the Earth (and particularly the British Isles) by invading (and very slimy) hordes from Mars.  Not only is this book an enjoyable sci-fi yarn but it also gives a different view of imperialism, namely from the view of the people being conquered.  When the book was written, imperialism was at its zenith and an unquestioned fact of life.  What Wells did was show the flip-side of imperialism and what it would have been like had the British (or any other colonial power) been on the receiving end of it.  The martians represent the European colonial militaries that easily push aside ineffective native armies represented in the book by the British populace.<br />For all sci-fi fans, this is a must-read.	2003-03-13

Starting with the beginning of the Soviet state and going all through the Cold War, the authors, using a tongue-in-cheek style, show the variety methods used in the US to get the anti-communist message across.  These methods ranged from pamphlets and posters to magazine articles and comic books.  The book's only serious problem is the downplaying of how much of a menace the communist world was (and still is in the case of North Korea and the other Red holdouts).	2003-03-12

Barry Williams writes a tome that only an insider could dealing with the behind the scenes goings on of the popular TV series, &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;.  Written with a humorous, never-too-serious tone, Williams (who played Greg Brady on the show) tells of the fights and misadventures of the Brady cast as well as the friendliness and respect they had for each other.  The reader will learn of Tiger's demise as well as the Battle of the Bras and Greg's first toke.  <br />I heartily recommend this book for anyone who enjoyed the series.	2003-03-11

It provides an account of each featured celeb's life and (of course) death no matter how tawdry either the former or latter may be.  Suicides, murders, old age, disease, and every other imaginable way the Grim Reaper takes his harvest is here.  One will be saddened over the suicides of Freddie Prinz and River Phoenix as well as feel pride over how a real-life cowboy and hero like Buck Jones went to his final roundup rescuing people in real life as he did so many times on film.  My only recommendation is that the reader should read only a few pages at a time since the book can prove rather depressing what with seeing the often sad end of so many bright stars.	2003-03-06

However, it must be remembered that the Final Solution had its beginnings elsewhere.  The author has done good job in treating this subject that hasn't been touched upon in much depth before now in Holocaust literature, namely the subject of the Einsatzgruppen.  The Einsatzgruppen, the group that carried out the deaths of millions in the East via mass shooting, burning, and gassing, is detailed in informative and often grisly fashion.  The reader will recoil in horror at how supposedly civilized men, both German and others, commit the most unspeakable acts of depravity to the most defenseless of humanity.  Some did so out of sadistic glee while others did so because of the perverse belief that they were doing their duty to Germany.  It was this latter view that Himmler himself tried to foster without much success.  This book is an important volume for anyone interested in the Holocaust or even World War II on the Eastern Front.	2003-03-03

The reader will come in contact with the brave defenders of the Cawnpore Entrenchment and learn of their hellish ordeal. The reader will be shocked by accounts of horrific massacres committed by both the Indians and the English.

Filled with descriptions of mutilated bodies, atrocities, and other unpleasant things, this book is not only a good primer on the Bosnian War but also shows the addiction to war that can take place that is similar to drug addiction.  The author himself indulged in both pursuits and makes no bones about it.  While sitting in a warm, comfortable chair, it is difficult to imagine that anyone could wish to subject themselves to a situation in which sudden death could occur.  However, the author, from his own experience as well as the listing of others, proves that this can happen.	2002-07-12

From human footprints and skeletons estimated to be millions of years old to evidence of human habitation far older than science is willing to admit, the authors gather these and many more bits of evidence that demolish accepted evolutionary theory.  The book's only drawback is its length and sometimes dry explanation of discoveries and why they are valid.  In fact, the reader can sometimes be forgiven for thinking he/she is reading a textbook on archeology.  However, this weakness is also a strength in that the reader will see that the discoveries listed aren't included willy-nilly but rather have strong reason to be considered as valid scientific evidence.  Indeed, the authors allow noted scientists who were connected to the time when the discoveries were made to do the explaining which makes the book all the more stronger.  The book also raises the disturbing question (a question asked by Charles Hoy Fort decades earlier) about the scientific community really being willing to entertain all evidence, even that which conflicts will dearly held theory.	2002-07-11

Most battles and skirmishes in which black troops took part are mentioned here.  The book's only faults are its ponderous length, its discounting of massacres committed by the U.S.C.T. against Confederates, and its discounting of the contributions of blacks to the Southern cause.  (Unknown to many, there were blacks who sided with the CSA and did shoulder arms for it.)  Otherwise, this book is good primer on a part of the Union army that at the end of the war was 10% of the Union's total force.	2002-07-11

Books	5	3	4	N	N	Fascinating story of a Japanese fighter ace	This book is a must for any history buff or anyone interested in seeing WWII through enemy eyes.  This work chronicles the career of Saburo Sakai and his many air battles through World War II.  His words debunk many myths about Japanese pilots (he admits of even turning back from a suicide mission) and gives one a personal feel to the historical events that unfolded around him.  One can also plot the technological climb of aircraft as Sakai describes how his adversaries' aircraft steadily got better and better.  This book is also a must read for those who think the development of new aircraft and weapons are a waste of money.  They will see through Sakai's words how one superior aircraft (the Zero) was able to command the skies in the war in the Pacific for quite some time until better aircraft finally were developed by the US.  In the future the US may not have the luxury of time and should plan ahead.<br />This is a superior book and one of the best written about World War II.	2002-07-10

This story has rarely been touched upon in books until now.  The author recounts many first hand narratives of survivors of the violence that was doled out to anyone of German ancestry who found themselves in areas conquered by the Soviet army plus lists evidence gathered by the German Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau.  Among the horrors the reader will encounter is the savagery dealt out to citizens of the German town of Nemmersdorf which included crucifictions of women and the mass murder of children.  The reader will march along ethnic Germans being forced from their homes in eastern Europe and will witness the wholesale murders that befell many.  <br />De Zayas proves that victims know no nationality.  I recommend this book for all interested in World War II and the immediate aftermath.	2002-07-10

After reading the book, I don't doubt any of the stories because of the honesty one can see throughout the tome.  Ward tells a convincing story of what it was like to work on a hit 1960's TV show with all of the highs and pitfalls.  This book goes a long way in explaining why Adam West still doesn't want to relinquish the bathood.  (Anyone who had that many groupies wouldn't likely give up the hood willingly either.)  <br />Anyway, it's a funny book, but only for those who can stand the detailed descriptions of Ward's nocturnal escapades.

An extremely shallow person, Bateman knows the price of everything yet knows the value of nothing.  From his shallow world, he makes sorties into savagery that include murder, torture, and cannibalism.  No one is off limits to this conduct, not women and not even children.    <br />The book is quite interesting as it shows greed and lack of concern for one's fellow people taken to an extreme.  The tome even possesses a savage sense of humor.  (Apparently NO ONE, not even a psycho, likes a mime.)  As can be imagined, this work isn't for everyone.  The incredibly detailed descriptions of sadistic depravity is enough to shake the foundations of the most jaded reader.  Furthermore, the reader's level of comfort is hard to come back to since many of the Bateman's crimes were taken from actual crime cases.  However, those willing to brave the pages will get a modern day morality tale.	2002-07-09

Given this, they probably believe that the NKPA and Chinese weren't so bad with prisoners.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This book documents the horrendous atrocities dealt out to US and Allied troops during the Korean War from loading up wounded on trucks and sending them over cliffs to using POW's as bayonet dummies.  Furthermore it details POW's released after the ceasefire and has evidence that many more POW's were still held in communist custody.<br />This book is a must read for anyone interested in the Korean War.	2002-07-08

On the former, the author goes after popular myths like Agent Orange supposedly causing cancer, there being more draftees in Vietnam than say WWII, etc. and demolishes them with fact.  On the latter, Burkett exposes the frauds (both famous and obscure) who claim to be Vietnam vets or vets with high decorations.  Among those who Burkett shines the light of truth: 1)one fellow who claimed to have participated in atrocities yet his specialty wasn't one that would have allowed him to even be in the situation he described; 2)one man who claimed the Medal of Honor falsely; 3)one fellow who described exploits in Vietnam yet never actually set foot in Southeast Asia; 4) one person who claimed combat service yet was never in the military at all.

Basically, the communists had &quot;experts&quot; (really party hacks) who thought they knew everything about agricultural such as burying seeds several feet into the ground to produce good growth and planting crops close to each other so they could help each other grow.  These techniques failed miserably but no one would admit the failures in the communist chain of command.  Glowing reports of record crops were passed along to the point that Mao was wondering what to do with the surplus.  Before it was over, millions had died and countless others were reduced to cannibalism.  <br />If anyone ever thought that George Orwell didn't know about Communists and that way of thinking, he/she should read this book. Everything about it rings like an unpublished Orwell novel, but it was all too true for the millions who died.  This work should definately be required reading for high school students.	2002-07-05

Indeed, the talk by the leader Mugabe pointed towards a peaceful, prosperous nation that even impressed former Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith.  However, it soon became apparent that Mugabe and his cohorts had lied to any and all who would listen.  Mugabe waged (and continues to wage) a brutal campaign against fellow Zimbabweans (black and white) that includes intimidation, torture, and murder.  He ignores court rulings he doesn't agree with and rewards cronies with ill-gotten money.

Had the author been content to describe how war propaganda is used to target certain emotions, this book would be an essential addition to the libraries of those who are interested in thought control by the state.  However, the author overreached himself and tried to make explain all hostitilities in the world.  He falls into the trap of using theory that is questionable at best to overanalyze certain forms of propaganda and extrapolates that to explain all forms of enmity.  However, the author overlooks the fact that often pre-hostilities, most common people really don't have enmity towards other lands.  (Is not a common lament by academics that Americans don't know of other countries unless they're attacked by them?)  Thus the author's main contention falls apart.  <br />The book also posseses many other problems such as: 1)the author thinking that war can be eliminated.  Such sentiment, while admirable, is naive and dangerous.  Certain problems will exist as long as humanity exists.  War is one of them as is crime.  There will be evil people who will resort to war like Hitler, Pol Pot, etc.  The author fails to take this into account just as a hypothetical person who believes crime can be eliminated fails to take into account Jeffrey Dahmer, Albert Fish, and John Wayne Gacy.  2) the author implies there is no difference between the Nazi Reich's army and the US army in Vietnam.  Furthermore, the author calls the US's war in Vietnam \\"immoral\\".  Such belief is inexcusable.  The US was attempting to save South Vietnam from communist takeover and, after the US pulled out, millions of lives were lost to the communists.  The author briefly mentions the deaths in Cambodia but apparently misses the connection between the US's \\"immoral\\" war and the keeping of those millions alive.  Also inexcusable is the author not mentioning the thousands who died taking to rickety boats fleeing from North Vietnam and those who died in \\"reeducation camps\\".  3) the author denouncing the efforts against the USSR and Sandanista Nicaragua.  In both cases, the US enmity that the author decries helped end both nations and bring about freedom at least more than existed before.  Eastern Europe is free as is Nicaragua which repeatedly turned away commmunist candidates.  4) the author relies on high-sounding rhetoric that doesn't stand the test of reality such as war rarely solves conflict.  Tell that to the city fathers of Carthage or Hiroshima. <br />This book's only bright spot is its reproducing of war propaganda, much of which has gone unseen since the time it was first used.	2002-07-01

This curse, though, is wickedly unique because it is one that makes the fellow lose weight at alarming rate.  Soon the lie of the old saying that one cannot be too thin is soon exposed as the businessman gets thinner and thinner.<br />For fans of King and those who like a good horror tale, this is a good book to pick.	2002-06-26

The tale involves a woman pursued by a monster much more terrifying than any vampire or werewolf, namely the woman's abusive police officer husband who's weak grip on sanity breaks as he trails his runaway wife.  King's great characters shine as does the realistic plot.  I had read many King novels that came out before &quot;Rose Madder&quot; and had noticed that some of them started to repeat themselves plot-wise (basically small town people tackling a monster of some sort).  I had thought King himself had run out of ideas until I read this book.  King has once again proved himself a great storyteller.	2002-06-26

Mass rapes, mass torture, and mass executions in every imaginable way (beheading, burial alive, burning, etc.) was common during the occupation.  While exact numbers will likley never be known, it is believed that well over 100,000 Chinese lost their lives.  <br />Readers of this unrelenting book will grimace at photos of victims of the Japanese army including a man in the process of being beheaded, recoil at the glib reporting of a \\"beheading contest\\" in a Japanese newspaper in which two Japanese officers see who can decapitate the most Chinese, and finally have some of their faith in humanity restored by heroes in the foreign section of Nanking that refused to leave and saved countless Chinese lives in the process.  Especially interesting is that one of the heroes was an ardent Nazi by the name of John Robe.  He saved countless lives and risked death numerous times at the hands of the Japanese army.<br />This book is not for the weak of heart.  It is relentless and pulls no punches in the telling of the horrors inflicted on the populace of Nanking.  However, it is essential reading for those interested in the Chinese-Japanese War and the period before World War II.	2002-06-26

Nothing could have been further from the truth. &quot;Scalp Dance&quot; shows the gory, harrowing battles waged by handfuls of ill-equipped soldiers against some of the most vicious opponents America has ever faced. Usually outnumbered and sometimes even despised by some of their own countrymen, these troops were the men who made the settling of the West a fact. Until now, their story and their sacrifices have been largely forgotten thanks to mountains of PC rhetoric. Now &quot;Scalp Dance&quot; has rectified that. Those who loved the movie &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; should read this book of FACTUAL accounts of the Plains Wars for a no-holds-barred history lesson. &quot;Scalp Dance&quot; is bloody, suspenseful book that is all the more relevant because it's actual history.	2002-06-26

It spans from the rise of warrior king Shaka Zulu to the final destruction of Shaka's empire at the hands of the British army. While the sheer size of the tome may be a daunting prospect for many to tackle, the book will reward those who read it with a knowledge of the most colorful portions of African history. For instance you will be acquainted with the largest defeat ever suffered by the British army at the hands of natives. You'll also learn about the incredible stand at Rourke's Drift of 103 British soldiers against 4,000 Zulus. If you liked the movies, &quot;Zulu&quot;, &quot;Shaka Zulu&quot;, or &quot;Zulu Dawn&quot;, read this book.

No side emerges with completely clean hands for there is plenety of barbaric behavior to go around from Europeans burning alive Indians in a house to Mohawks slowly burning and torturing to death two teenaged female colonists.  Everything (especially the demise of a colonist captured by the Shawnee) is described in grisly detail, and it is enough to destroy your faith in all humanity.  There is no room here for \\"Dances With Wolves\\" or any sentiment like it.  <br />It should be required reading for those interested in the Indian Wars.	2002-06-26

People who've grown up on the \\"Cat in the Hat\\" will be surprised to see the same man lampooning Hitler, Mussolini, Imperial Japan, and American isolationists in his own whimsical way.  For Seuss fans and those interested in WWII, this book should rate a look.  The only problem with the book is the way it is arranged.

The US conducting a campaign of \\"island-hopping\\" to fight the enemy?  The Japanese using suicide aircraft to defend themselves?  This sounds like a history of WWII but it isn't from WWII but rather a novel written years before.  What the author has done is basically use military logic to write a book that details a clash between the US and Japan.  Some parts of the book are right on the mark with what would later happen for real in World War II.  However, other parts miss wide such as the author having the US use gas as a weapon.  <br />As novels go, this book really isn't that exciting.  It's main interest is to the historian, both professional and amateur, who is interested in what was foreseen by some people in the 1920's.	2002-06-25

While some of the things listed arguably didn't have an ultimate win-lose effect on Germany in the war (the failure to take Moscow and the failure to repel the D-Day invasion) others cannot be so easily disregarded.  For example, several times Germany came close to vanquishing Britain early in the war and thus likely had a chance to win the entire war.  The failure to destroy the British army at Dunkirk, the failure to invade Britain soon after the Dunkirk debacle, and the failure to destroy the RAF are all things that Hitler had within his grasp yet blundered the opportunities away (thankfully so for the rest of the world).  <br />This book should give most if not all readers a chill when they realize how frighteningly close Nazi Germany came to victory.	2002-06-25

The stories themselves are unsettling not just because of the subject matter but under the conditions which some of them occur.  For example, not all of the stories concern people driven under desperate circumstances to feed on human flesh (although there are quite a few stories concerning instances in which that happened such as the ill-fated Donner party).  Many of the tales have cannibalism being practiced voluntarily by some cultures in the Pacific and pre-Columbian North America.  Furthermore, there are stories concerning human monsters in modern day America like serial killers Albert Fish and Jeffery Dahmer who preyed on their neighbors.  <br />Clearly this book requires a strong stomach to read but for those interested in real life Hannibal Lecters and what happens to people driven to the depths of hunger that modern man rarely knows, it is an essential read.	2002-06-25

In the 1950's, Wertham undertook a crusade to rid the world of comic books (yes, you read correctly) and chronicled his effort in this book. Wertham decided that comics (ALL comics) were destroyers of youth. To him, no comic book was benign. Superhero comics like Wonder Woman and Superman promoted white supremacy and homosexuality, Crime and Horror comics made kids into sadistic outlaws, etc. As a result of his book and efforts, comics were effectively neutered through the comics code. Granted some of the points Wertham made about the effects of graphic horror had on youngsters had merit, but most were far off the mark. This book is a must-read for anyone who loves comics and their history. It's also a great reference to find the most interesting comics of the 1950's.	2002-06-25

Far from being comprised of just paired male combatants that most people think, the author shows that the games often had groups of men fighting against other groups, women fighting against dwarves, animals fighting against animals, men fighting against animals, etc.  Detailed is the fact that even though gladiators were considered lowest of the low by Rome's citizenry, they were schizophrenically idolized by Rome's men and women to a point that freeborn men sometimes voluntarily joined the gladiator ranks and freeborn women would leave much wealth in order to run away with the fighters.  Although the book would be better if it was footnoted, this can be overlooked because of the reading quality.  <br />For a good read on the savagery that was the gladiatoral arena, this book is one to get.  Readers, though, should be advised that some of the imagery conjured up is quite harsh.	2002-06-24

Ms. Fuller lists the traumas of life in Rhodesia during the war including her parents warning her not to startle them or they might shoot her, a policeman warning her and other children not to pick up gaily decorated packages because they could be booby-trapped, and other harrowing tidbits.

(The author claims that a huge chunk of the public gets its info from these sites when in actuality it is more likely to get its info from school and movies since most people only visit a handful of historical sites.) The book was disappointing to say the least and enraging to say the most. The first few pages give the reader what he/she can expect in the rest of the book, namely inaccuracies and a legion of half-truths. An example of the former is that the author stated Nathan Bedford Forrest founded the KKK. In reality, Forrest did not. He was a leader after the founding and later ordered the group disbanded. An example of the half-truths is the author listing a speech from a Sioux Indian decrying Mount Rushmore as a symbol of conquerors. In actuality the Sioux TOOK the Black Hills area from other tribes, notably the Crow. Thus it is more than a bit hypocritical to complain about conquerors. The author was under an obligation to point that fact out since the purpose of his book was supposedly to tell the whole truth about information historical sites don't list. However, he doesn't. (This in itself is surprising since the author complains at the start of the book about being 'warped' by inaccurate historical sites and yet by not telling the whole truth the author is doing that same thing with unintiated readers of his book.) Another problem with the book is the author's extreme biases which pop up again and again such as his dealing with Nathan Forrest and practically anything connected to the Confederacy. He decries Forrest having more monuments built to him than anyone else and leaves the reader thinking that this is obviously because Forrest was a racist. However, the author never mentions Forrest's Civil War record which shows that Forrest was arguably the best cavalry commander of the war, North or South.  <br />To be fair, there are some nuggets worth reading but frankly it just isn't worth what the reader has to wade through to get to them. By his biases and refusal to tell the whole truth, the author destroyed what had the makings of a great book.	2002-05-01

Books	4	69	88	N	N	Provides much food for thought	To be honest, the book is strongly biased towards the Confederate cause (as if the title didn't already establish that).  This bias is as solid for the Confederacy as books like &quot;Lies Across America&quot; are biased towards the Union.  With that being said, however, this book provides much food for thought with many facts that are put forth.  Before reading this book, I couldn't imagine that any black person would side with the South during the Civil War.  My history texts in school derided the idea.  However, the authors' evidence as well as more that I've found in related readings show that there were indeed pro-CSA blacks.  This infuriates other historians who for some reason cannot accept this.  However, the facts are there.  <br />This book is a must for anyone interested in the Civil War.	2002-04-29

This book, though, sets the record straight.  Even though it is a small tome, it packs a wallop in both information and logic.  It lays out the case that Texas was as independent from Mexico as Mexico was from Spain and that Texas was as free to do with its freedom whatever it wanted to including joining the US.  It lays out the case that the Texas border was at the Rio Grande, not the Neuces.  It lays out a particularly devestating case that shows Mexican saber-rattling.  I urge everyone who has the slightest bit of interest in that time period to read this book.	2001-12-20

Far from being an uncouth racist as much of the world's press would classify him as, Smith shows himself to have been a model statesmen and ardent patriot to his beloved Rhodesia.  Clearly the book reads like a Greek tragedy in which tiny Rhodesia is betrayed by its mother country (Britain) and even its friends (South Africa) in its long struggle against terrorist organizations in which it racked up an impressive military record.  For all interested in that little country that once was, this is a definate necessary read.  After finishing the tome, one can see why Ian Smith so richly deserved the praise he received from his fellow Rhodesians and anti-communist well-wishers around the world.  God bless you, Ian Smith, for your valiant fight.	2000-10-11

Anyone interested in that period of American history  needs to read this tome.  My only problems with the book are: -the  reference to the Internment of the Japanese during World War II being  wrong.  Looking back from 2000, the internment does seem bad.  However, in  1942 the US was actually faced with the possibility of an invasion on the  West Coast.  The main bulwark against such a threat was lying at the bottom  of Pearl Harbor.  Since there were pro-Imperial Japanese rallies on the  West Coast up to Pearl Harbor, the US government was justified in thinking  that some of the population might harbor pro-Axis (namely Imperial Japan)  sympathies and might help an invader.  Also of note was that 50,000 of the  120,000 interned were NOT American citizens but foreign nationals. -the  reference to Lincoln's hanging of 38 Sioux Indians being bad.  While the  Sioux were pushed into an uprising against the US government because of no  food, atrocities did result at some Indian hands such as children being  hacked to bits, babies being roasted alive, etc.  The original hanging  docket was to have been several hundred of the Sioux but Lincoln whittled  it down to the 38 hanged.	2000-08-11

Strange and often violent, many of these groups are detailed by the author.   My biggest problems with the book are: 1) the author allows his leftist  leanings to shine through at various points, particularly at the end.  He  attacks conservatives, he tarnishes Christians who believe in a literal  interpretation of the Bible and even (incredibly) attacks those  Christians  who support Israel.  This last item is particularly bizarre because many of  the survivalist groups listed in the book are anti-Israel (to say the  least), and the author belittles the groups because of it. 2) the author  tries to lump in serial killers like Ng and Lake into the far-Right  survivalist movement.  There is enough material floating about concerning  far-Right survivalist groups that tossing in serial murderers isn't  necessary.	2000-08-02
