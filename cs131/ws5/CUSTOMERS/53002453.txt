What did it add to the story to tell us that one deputy was black and two were white? Race had nothing to do with the story...I mean, this was not a story about lynchings or the KuKluxKlan. But we had to learn that Ernie was black, the trailer park was mostly white, Zack, Kayra, Cyl were black but most others were not.  If there was a reason for these differentiations, I totally missed it, and they detracted and distracted from the story. 4 stars for the plot, 2 stars for the perplexity.	2005-09-10

The premise was promising, but the journey was lacking.  Believe me, readers, you are going to be bored out of your skull with all of the DNA information.  Even with my medical background, I was to the point of just skipping over sections. Actually tried to skip a few but lost the thread, had to back up and reread...tedious. Lesson from a famous trial, most people do not understand or even care about DNA. The ending was also less than satisfying.  Of course, writing a book about this subject is a kind of no-win situation, and I am sure Ms. Reich's research was extensive, but...I was disappointed.	2005-08-21

Having been to the PNW, the Olympic Penninsula, Neah Bay, the Rain Forest, and having seen the complete rape of the forested areas, this book made me aware all over again. The majority of the population has no concept of what has transpired on our forested lands, and maybe the majority just doesn't give a crap about the trees we have lost, or the landslides resulting from these losses.  After all, it's not like it's in their backyard if they live in the Midwest or Southwest, or even the East.  Ms. Stokes has woven a neat little mystery in with a history lesson, and an ecological statement. And, she has done a fantastic job.	2005-08-21

Finally, a book that flowed, did not have a bunch of misspelled words and sentences that made no sense.  Also, a book with length and substance.  Have gotten so aggravated with the books that Bella puts out only having 200 pages or less.  The above out of the way, the story was good and the characters were nicely done. There was one part that made me put the book down and just do something else for awhile.  Have to admit, that while I love  crime and mayhem, am not much into rape scenes...especially graphic ones.  They do nothing for the story to my way of thinking, but the victim handled it well.  And, maybe the ending was a little cliched, but all and all, very enjoyable.  Plus, and I thank you Ms. Hill, the main character did not look like Xena, well, not too much.	2005-08-03

After the disasterous \\"Flash Back\\" and the decent \\"High Country\\", this book is a real winner.  Even the parallel/entertwining storyline was exceptional.  Yes, it was \\"dark\\" as many reviewers have stated, but, people, look around you...it is a dark world we are living in now.  This book could just have well been nonfiction.  The crazies are here and are getting scarily crazier.  Anyway, back to the book.  I had told myself that if Anna ever got married to Paul, that I would stop reading her books.  Not because she got married, but because when Paul was in the previous books, Anna was so danged needy and dependent, and yes, simpering. But, I do have to ask...why have a marriage and then schlepp off for a post in Colorado. Anna should probably be home doing her wifely duties instead of off in the wilderness getting the crap knocked out of her. Ah, but I digress.....great book Ms. Barr.  Plus, love your new \\"do\\".	2005-04-09

In all of her other books about Scarpetta, the book is written in the first person. <br />This book is like it is being narrated, and poorly at that. Many, many paragraphs/sentences have no flow. The transition from \\"The Last Precinct\\" to this book made no sense. Thinking maybe I missed something along the way, I went back and read the last four chapters of \\"Last Precinct\\". Should have just read that book again and not wasted the many hours spent reading this one. My one star is generous.	2004-08-13

Again Stephanie and Lula were in some dandy messes. The event of the &quot;humpers&quot; made me laugh so hard I got choked, then I coughed so hard, I got wet.<BR>Agreed, the book kind of petered out the last few pages, but, so what.

All of those glaringly misspelled words.  And, if they are so numerous that they disrupt my flow of reading, why can't a decent editor find and fix them. Also, what the heck is a &quot;Pellegrine&quot; falcon?<BR>Other than the above gripes, the book was an entertaining read, even if I did think the main character was about as dense as a concrete block. Why ask for advice if you have absolutely no intention of considering it? Why call your lawyer to make a new will but not call him back to cancel it? Why stay in the same hotel when everything you own has been stolen or shredded?  <BR>Why would anyone wear 5&quot; heels?	2004-03-31

After the miscue of &quot;Flashback&quot;, I was absolutely thrilled that in &quot;High Country&quot; Anna was the Anna of earlier works. She's back where she belongs, in the high country, tough, gutsy and totally enjoyable. The plot is great, the characters are believable, and the scenery is beautiful. Thank you Ms. Barr.  I am not going to waste words doing a synopsis...the dust jacket does that. So, to all of you who were so disappointed with &quot;Flashback&quot;, please run out and get this one.

Carol Ashton takes a bullet.  Thus, the character, the series and the readers will be put out of their collective misery.  Perhaps it's time to bring Sybil back into the series full time instead of just the occasional mention. Or, make the series about Aunt Sarah...she, at least, is interesting.  Det. Ashton has lost her passion, seemingly, for everything. Her cases, her friendships, her <BR>lovers(?), and her overall interactions with everyone around her are as stale as week old bread. It's a doggone shame.	2003-10-18

A delightful book...laughed so hard at times that I darn near choked. This is a tight little mystery, and I have(and hate) to admit that it took me a long time to figure out who the villain was. Emily's grandmother was a hoot...sort of like Grandma Mazur but from the Midwest. If you like &quot;laugh-out-loud&quot; mysteries in the vein of Joan Hess (Maggody series) and Janet Evanovich, you must read this author.

It was (and still is, since I can't seem to get through it) a struggle to read.<BR>443 pages is nice, but not when it is drivel. As I usually do my reading on the deck, one nice result of this book was that I began to really enjoy birdwatching.  Sorry, Ms. Georgio.

The reading of this book became a real chore....I found myself reading just to be reading, but not really enjoying. The beginning of the book was confusing, boring and not very well written.  The pace did seem to pick up when there was more of Chee/Leaphorn. The last 9-10 chapters, which were good, sort of balanced out the first 17-18 which were mediocre, hence the 3 star rating instead of 1 star.  And, while I'm crabbing, I want to address the fairly recent practice of putting out 200 page books for $....  I'm beginning to read some of the lesser known authors with \\"hefty\\" books so that I feel that I am getting my \\"money's worth\\".	2003-06-12

This would have been a five star book if it had not been for the repetitive use of &quot;for crissakes&quot;. The first few times caused me to chuckle. Then,everyone used the expression at least 10 times, and our heroine used it probably 50-60 times. Gee, what happened to the good old &quot;F&quot; word?  Surely it could have been thrown in a few times.  Other than that gripe, it was very good read as has been all of the others Ms. Speart has written.  Her books always make me want to visit the area Rachel has found herself.	2003-03-16

Like some of the other reviewers, I count the days (months, years) waiting for the new Anna Pigeon books....this wasn't the best that Nevada Barr has ever written but was still very enjoyable. I found no problems with jumping back and forth in time but it did become tedious.  Note to Ms. Barr...if you do have Anna get married, I will probably quit reading your books. Marriage always changes the dynamics...the woman is no longer tear-... strong, but has to run home to hubby for advice, hugging, healing sex, help in any way or form. Please don't do that to Anna.

I have read every one of the Abby Timberlake books and have enjoyed them all...but this one had me scrambling to find her first books so I could reread them.  Sure enough, Ms. Myers has changed her style of writing...her heroine now &quot;wails&quot; and &quot;screams&quot;, and gnashes her teeth and chews the scenery on almost every page.

After reading some of the reviews, I figure I'm the rare bird that did not care all that much about this book.  There was the beautiful doctor and the beautiful nurse, and the beautiful father and beautiful mother of the beautiful doctor. And, the kinda beautiful mother and kinda beautiful father of the beautiful nurse.  Oh yeah, the beautiful doctor also had a beautiful brother, a beautiful house, a beautiful view, beautiful clothes and a beautiful car.  Let's not forget the beautiful doctor's beautiful teddy bear, and the beautiful nurse's beautiful stuffed dog with the beautiful ribbon. And guess what...the beautiful doctor and the beautiful nurse just happened to resemble warrior princess and sidekick.

It fleshed out the characters well, gave pretty decent background, kept a good pace, and was a very good mystery. Loved Jess and Buster.  Got more than a few chuckles, but.........as good as the book was, I felt let down in the last chapter.  Is was as if Ms. Morris wanted to end the book in 225 pages or less, and she did.

Liked the new character the Ms. McClellan has introduced, however, all this ambiguity regarding Shelby was tiresome. Several different places in the book referred to Shelby as 'she', then in another chapter, Shelby was 'he'.  Also, Ms. McClellan should insist upon a new proof reader. There were passages that had to be read and reread to make sense.  Overall, though, a very enjoyable story.	2001-03-14

I really enjoy the Em Hanson books and would have easily given the other books in the series 5 stars, but this book is far too technical for the average reader. At times, I felt like I was reading a miner's manual.  For me, all of the explanations of mining procedures, chemical analysis and mineral analysis did not add to the story.  I found myself skipping over many paragraphs then would have to back up and reread.  That got very tedious.	2000-12-23
