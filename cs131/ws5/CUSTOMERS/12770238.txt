Colson: A Life Redeemed	Books	1	8	75	N	N	The first refugee of scoundrels	Nixon apologist and ex-con Jonathan Aitken serves up this loving tribute to his fellow ex-con Chuck Colson. Aitken serves on the board of Colson's prison ministry, so any expectation of objectivity flies out of the cell door. In Aitken's long-ago, forgotten biography of his hero Richard Nixon, he similarly soft-peddled  Nixon's crimes. At least this time out the former Tory MP, who just got out of a British prison himself a couple of years ago, forgoes the ludicrous conspiracy theories that made his Tricky Dick biography such a joke. Unlike the unfortunate convicts unmercifully hounded and courted by Colson's ministry, Colson was preaching to the choir with Aitken, who returns the favors to Colson, with this way-too-thick inspirational sop. <br />	2005-09-20

Every excuse for the women she cites comitting  crimes is dredged out and covered weakly with academic gloss. Most women are in prison for violent, not non-violent crimes, which invalidates many of her arguments for them as primarily society's victims (as prostitutes, drug addicts etc.) A lower % of African-American women are in prison than African-American men, which she fails to cite, and also fails to butress her points. The whinier of the voices she quotes also grates after a while. <br />	2005-08-17

Basically it's a thinly veiled manipulation to garner support for his appeals of his sentence. Some of the writing, such as a excrucriatingly long analogy of children and acorns, wouldn't ever see print without the author's notoriety, and ability for self-publicizing. <br />	2005-08-17

His total bias toward his hometown New York is understandable, but his twisting of statistics to laud his heroes, and the fact that this posthumous collection does not properly credit his fellow  SABR members' research is unfortunate.

An examination of the bibliography, therefore, provides future researchers with a very incomplete picture of the extent of their work. Moreover, they eschew footnotes in favor of a general listing of sources for each chapter. Trying to pinpoint the source of the authors' conclusions or a particular quotation, consequently, is virtually impossible, and weighing the number of sources they used to establish a point even more frustrating. The result is often the impression that a thin foundation of a single quotation or story supports many of the DeValerias' conclusions. <br />	2005-08-05
