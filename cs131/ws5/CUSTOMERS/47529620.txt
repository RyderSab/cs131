Many people have sent folks back into old Rome, but Rebecca East changes it up sending her main character Miranda, back to Pompeii before its destruction.  Set in a city made famous for its ruins, you can't help but be captivated by having it come to life!  I will agree with some of the reviews that some better editing could have been done as some paragraphs are repetitions of paragraphers earlier said in the book, however it only minially detracts from what is otherwise a great story of historical fiction. A modern day fairy tale!	2005-07-11
US	47529620	R16IX7913IBXII	0449210820	828917815	Woman on the Edge of Time	Books	3	5	8	N	N	Good read, but not a great time travel tale	I had picked up this book specifically because it had time travel involved and I'm a time travel nut.  In this particular book, the main character, Connie, \\"travels\\" to the future, the year 2137 supposedly.  Of course, since she is in a mental institution, there is a bit of the theme: Is she crazy or is it real?  The writing was well done, the character development was fantastic.  The time travel was left wanting.  This is a great drama story, a good woven tale.  I feel a bit jilted as the author left the ending too open ended, as if just to create a forever left argument over her schizophrenia or time travel.  That felt a bit too contrived.  A good open ending can let you argue one way or the other based upon your reading.  This book's open ending was too open...and no good basis could be derived for either telling.  A great read, a disappointing end.  I wouldn't have even normally left this review for a 3 star book, but with all these 5 star ratings which led to me buy it, I felt the whole spectrum needed to be represented.	2005-06-25

I read this book based off a reccomendation of a friend who buys it for all her guy friends.  I'll tell you, as a female, it is great to hear the views Eldredge has.  Men are not created by God to be weak kneed individuals, who exchange passion for femininity.  However, I do think he draws too many results that are geared towards men who are more outdoorsy or sports like.  I'm not sure the introverted bookworm may find this book that life altering.  I did give the book to my boyfriend after reading it because I could see it applying perfectly to his life.  For the man that longs to be courageous and on adventure and feels 'stuck' being the nice guy, Eldredge encourages him that the former is what God is searching for.  As Lewis put, and Eldredge perfectly quoted, God...and thus by example men shouldn't be safe, but GOOD.  A great read to motivate a man to be the man he really is or wants to be.  Let's go on adventure together!	2005-04-07
US	47529620	R34QVBLCDF1XGO	0812564669	596423105	Household Gods	Books	4	5	5	N	N	I loved it until I read some of the bad reviews!	I am a time travel fan, so I picked up this book based on that aspect of it alone.  And maybe that's why I really enjoyed it!  Some reviewers rate Nicole, the main character, as a whiny uncaring person.  Okay, maybe she is, but she is a well developed and well written character.  You can easily slip into how she's feeling and reacting to all the situations.  In the course of the book, she gets sucked back to ancient Rome.  The authors have done a fabulous job of bringing ancient Rome to life!  Sure, the gal may have thrown her brain out the window, not remembering history and being not too cautious with local food, but SHE WAS JUST SUCKED BACK INTO TIME!  I think that gives her a little reasoning to not be reacting completely logically or level headed.<br />So, in other words, if you like time travel, more specifically enjoy reading about time culture shock, this is a fantastic book to read.  If you like well developed characters, read this book, I knew I was going to like it before she went back to Rome by the character development alone.<br />MORE IMPORTANTLY, dont let the reviewers that whine about the main character ruin it for you.  I was able to get lost in the story until I checked to see what people had to see about it.<br />A fantastic collaboration and a nice addition to the historical time travel fiction!	2004-03-25

Probably because this book literally is one of the few books that truly does have everything in it!  Sci-fi, time travel, romance, sex, fairy tales, mystery, even Disney.  Okay, there's no Western.<BR>This book would have something you are sure to enjoy, which part of the book that may be for you, I don't know.  Because the main character, Beauty, travels and lives in so many different places and times, with so many different people, it's like it's almsot several books in one.<BR>And the whole time you wonder, just what is happening.  As you start to figure one portion of it out, a whole other portion opens up and sets more questions spinning.<BR>I don't want to say much what goes on in the story because 1) there is way to much to explain and 2) Finally!!  A book that is neither predictable or boring!  A book that keeps you wondering, guessing, speculating what is coming next and what has already happened.  Like I said, I'm not sure if I truly liked the book or not as far as reccomendation, but for sure creativity alone, the author deserves four stars!	2003-08-11
US	47529620	RRQMAEQG5YCYZ	0966484908	715296953	The Crucifixion Conspirators	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Worth one read, but not a second one.	For a time travel fan, it is a must read.  However, many of the fun things about time travel are avoided by the author in this story.  He writes away explanations against paradoxes, as if to take away the worry of really writing intelligently about that aspect of time travel.<br />The characters are varied and interesting, but fall short on any sort of connection or empathy with them.  I'd agree with an earlier review that rarely do you really feel he has put you back in time in early Jerusalem.<br />The twist on the crucifixtion is interesting, although again, he puts the charcacters exactly into the time frame that avoids having to address many aspects of Jesus and sticks with what is just easier to explain.<br />Also, a couple things in the book felt like he was going to go somewhere with it potentially thought provoking, and basically just dropped it.<br />It was worth a first time through, but definitely not one I'm going to keep on my shelves for a later read.	2003-08-11

As for Jonathan Kellerman, his Alex Delaware novels are always the ones I prefer.  Lately, however, I kept noticing a simliar theme.  Delaware seems to get caught, the bad guy spills the beans and the table fortunately turns.  Not so in this book.  So kudos for creative new endings.<BR>Also, the thing that I loved about this book, was the insight into Milo Sturgis, his past and his mind.  No more just a sidekick, providing a little gun power when needed, Sturgis stands alone as Kellerman provides real emotional material to this assistant character.<BR>The mystery and story line, of course, are Kellerman's usual goodness, but personally, I liked the look into Milo's life and the uncertainty going on in Alex's life.  Makes me more interested in the next novel coming out than I have ever been before!	2003-08-11

You've read it in the other reviews. 9 stories in all.  Some better than others, but each interesting in it's own right.  Although some endings dont turn out exactly as you wanted them to, Ruth Rendell does an excellent job of pulling you in, eager to read on.  My favorite story was &quot;High Mysterious Union&quot;, sort of a weird Stepford wives kind of feel to it.  In all her stories, you have no idea where she is going with it and as a result, each story is kept fresh, the reader alert.  No predictably to rely on.  This was the first time for me reading this author, and I'd like to read some of her novels.  The short stories were just tease and honestly, I didn't know it was a book of short stories when I picked it up, or else I wouldn't have.  However, I wasn't disappointed and rather enjoyed them all.	2003-08-11

This bible is finally everything I have been looking for in a study bible.  It has all the versions I was interested in comparing and is more than just the New Testament.  At the Christian bookstores near my house, this bible runs almost twice the cost of what Amazon.com carries it for, so even if you're paying for shipping, this is a great deal!  Open anywhere in the book and find all four translations looking back at you so you can easily compare line to line, verse to verse.  Also included, being a study bible, are notes and references that lead you elsewhere to learn more about what you just read.  This is a must have for anyone delving further into their studies and having some limited room on their bookshelf!!	2002-12-28

The action, the passion, the love these first missionarie had for the world are fictionalized in these diaries and presented in such an awesome first hand view, you have to sit back in awe.

For the Christian dieter however, we are told to present all our requests before God.  How or why would God care about that kind of prayer?  I always felt it selfish, but knew I couldn't succeed even I didn't turn that part of my life over to Him as well.  This book provides not only a daily devotion that can be applied to many areas, not just limited to dieting, but also provides earnest prayers that you can use for a basis of your own to turn selfish desires into a godly will.  Not only will this book help you keep the desire and focus of not giving up on your weight loss program, whatever it may be, but it focuses your need on God and his importance over our struggle with weight.	2001-09-26

Although A.I. is based off this book, it should be noted it's loosely based.  The short stories in this book that are on the supertoy theme are only a very small portion of the book.  They do not lend any insight, (as many other book which movies are based off of do), to what was going on in the movie or provide any answers to the Kubrick/Speilberg turn of events in the movie that made you wonder what was really going on in their heads.  This book may in fact be an excellent book, but I only bought it for the basis of being the basis for the movie and was sorely disappointed.  If only I had known it provided nothing much to A.I. except a very loose plot for the beginning of it and some names. I know this isn't a glowing review, but I only wish I had known it didn't give me that information before I had bought it and perhaps I'll prevent this book from being bought by a reader who can't appreciate it.	2001-07-09

I work in a Christian bookstore and held off buying this book for the longest time.  First off, it's small.  It looks kind of dinky and more like a nice little feel good gift book.  Plus, I hate buying things just because everyone else is. But as our sales informed me we were selling around 700 of them a month, I finally at least took a peek at one that was sitting on hold in customer service for a church bible study.  Within just a couple minutes, I could understand why this book is captivating so many people.  I can understand why its message is spreading like wildfire and I can understand why Jabez's prayer can change lives.  More importantly, after buying and reading the book (which is still a quick, but wonderfully in depth read) I am glad so many people are buying it.  For if we all learn to pray like this, what abundance our lives shall have!  *The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because I so enjoyed reading it I wish it were much much longer although it didn't need to be to get its message across*	2001-06-21

I have never seen a book with soo many quotes from other authors.  Every page it seems contains a few different excerpts from someone else's material.  Rather than be a unique or new information on the subject of human desires vs. God's, this was more of a collection of many people's insights without a true steady focus staying on one approach.

Based of the book of Acts and events in the book of Galatians, Edwards has created a book of fiction based on events so real that I was brought to tears to read of Paul's persecution, worried over the churches in Galatia, grinned at the always loveable Peter, but more importantly was inspired to search these books of the Bible more closely and deeper than I ever have before.
