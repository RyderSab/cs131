This is the second book by Lee Murphy in \\"The Kodiak Books,\\" which features the adventures of George Kodiak. I read th first book, \\"Where Legends Roam,\\" and was pretty disappointed by it. It seemed to focus much more on interpersonal drama than on the fabled hunt for the Sasquatch. Naitaka was a bit better because I found the subject matter more interesting, but it still relied heavily on this same tactic.<br /><br />The first half of this book is all about the legendary Ogopogo, which supposedly lives in the Okanagan lake. Unfortunately, we learn of the existence of this creature very early on, so there is not much mystery surrounding it. Even though there are no confirmed sightings of it in real life, in the book it suddenly starts surfacing everywhere and there are hundreds of eye-witness accounts. I think the book would have been better if George had to prove its existence. The book was going along pretty well until the second half, when the story did a complete 180 and instead of being a book about a fabled pre-historic whale, it was not about a serial killer, with the whale thrown in as a backdrop. The other things that were strange was that the book doesn't follow conventional patterns. The love interest that Murphy sets up early on doesn't followup, the person that starts to evolve as the villain turns out not to be, and several characters seem to exist in the story without much rhyme or reason. At the end of the novel I was a little confused, because the ending was completely unexpected. Some of you may think this is a good thing, but I found it a bit odd and disconcerting. The person I wanted to be the villain wasn't. The girl I wanted George to be with ended up with someone else. Normally surprise is a good thing but I was a little unsatisfied by the ending.<br /><br />Still, the story was fairly enjoyable, and was a quick read at less than 300 pages. I think there's a lot Murphy could have done to improve upon his book, but with the lack of novels focusing on this subject matter I'll take what I can get. I would definitely recommend Steve Alten's \\"The Loch\\" over this book if you can only read one story about lake monsters.han 300 pages.

I was left with that feeling I always have after finishing a Harry Potter book, one of longing until the next one comes out and trying to get my hands on every bit of Harry Potter information I could.<br /><br />\\"The Half-Blood Prince\\" is an excellent book, however if I had to grade it against the other Harry Potter books, I probably would have given it four stars.  The book simply lacks much of the excitement and suspense of the previous novels, such as \\"Goblet of Fire.\\"  The book starts off a bit slow, and it's not until the last 75 pages or so that Rowling really takes off and starts to create some suspense.  Between then we're left with the usual Harry Potter fare: Draco hates Harry, Snape hates Harry, Harry doesn't trust Snape, Hermione goes to the library a lot, etc etc.  When this book is made into a film, I can see the first half of it being rather boring.  However in terms of the Harry Potter series, much of this is necessary because the majority of what happens in the book is providing background and setting the reader up for the final novel in the series.  The reader is given a LOT of information on the characters that we didn't know more, especially Voldemort's past.<br /><br />As a stand-alone book, \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" could have used a little more action.  Although I didn't find myself gasping out loud or staying up late because I couldn't stop reading it like I did with previous books, it was a great story and provides useful information for what's sure to be an incredible climax to Ms. Rowling's adventures with Harry.  Potter fans shouldn't be disappointed.	2005-09-19

It follows \\"The Relic,\\" \\"Reliquary,\\" \\"Cabinet of Curiosities,\\" and \\"Still Life with Crows.\\" As the books have progressed past \\"Reliquary,\\" the authors began to focus more on Pendergast, and this novel features the agent reuniting with former NYPD Lt. Vincent D'Agosta from the first two novels.<br /><br />While I found \\"Brimstone\\" a decent read, I didn't enjoy it as much as the previous novels, and the underlying plot of the book, that several people are dying seemingly supernatural deaths of spontaneous combustion, wasn't exciting enough for me. I didn't spend the whole book wondering what could be causing the deaths or who was behind it like I felt I should have, and it almost seemed to take a backseat to the character development of D'Agosta for me and his relationship with Laura Hayward (from \\"The Reliquary\\"). My other problem with the novel was that it was left unfinished. Ie, there was a huge cliffhanger at the end of the story that almost certainly requires you to read the sequel \\"Dance of Death\\" if you want to have any kind of resolution at all. I don't feel that this ending was a copout, but I was a little aggravated that I had to wait several months for the sequel to find out what happened next.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that \\"Brimstone\\" is a fairly decent novel in the Agent Pendergast series, however I wouldn't suggest anyone pick it up who hasn't read the previous novels before and is familiar with Agent Pendergast. You certainly don't need to read the other stories and it stands up just fine on its own, but those that have read \\"The Relic\\" and \\"Reliquary\\" first I think will have more appreciation for the characters.	2005-09-19

It follows \\"The Relic,\\" \\"The Reliquary,\\" and \\"Cabinet of Curiosities.\\" Like the other three novels, you don't really need to read the prior stories to follow along with this one, and the authors provide enough detail about Pendergast that the reader can form a fairly vivid depiction of him without any previous background from the first novels, although it does help.<br /><br />Like the other three novels, this book deals with an unusual crime that requires the special investigative procedures of FBI Agent Pendergast. The crime is interesting enough (although not as interesting as the prior stories), however the entire story takes places in a small town in Kansas, and the scenery became pretty boring after awhile. It seemed like half the story was Agent Pendergast traipsing through cornfields and looking for clues. The story was definitely interesting, just not as interesting as what I have come to expect from Preston and Child. I was also a bit disappointed with the end of the novel where the killer is revealed. The explanation that was given was a little cheesy and far-fetched, even more so than from what I've come to expect from the authors. Even so, I did enjoy the story and found it an entertaining read, however I feel that Preston and Child could have added a bit more excitement to it to keep the reader's interest throughout the story, rather than cramming it all in the last 50 pages.	2005-07-27

Although this book is similiar to the first two, it revolves much more around Pendergast and really develops his character.<br /><br />Pendergast is a very wealthy erudian man who doesn't fit the stereotypical view of a federal agent.  While he certainly seems capable of taking care of himself, the authors do not portray him as a man who is developed in physical combat or good with a gun.  He almost comes off more as a Harvard professor than an FBI Agent.  Like the first two novels, this book focuses heavily on the New York Museum of Natural History and has a female protagonist who works at the museum, although it's clear Pendergast is the lead in this story.  The plot features some supernatural elements, but also has an interesting side story that natural history buffs will enjoy.<br /><br />\\"Cabinet of Curiosities\\" focuses more on detective work than a lot of action, and while not as exciting as \\"The Relic\\" or \\"Reliquary,\\" it's certainly an enjoyable story in its own right.	2005-07-20

After reading several Preston/Child novels lately and seeing that he has several books that revolve around Special Agent Pendergast, I decided to pick up Reliquary to see what it was look, and was not disappointed.<br /><br />\\"Reliquary\\" picks up 2 years after the events which took place in \\"The Relic,\\" and brings back all of the same characters. The new threat is similiar to the monster in \\"The Relic,\\" but is different enough to act almost as a standalone novel.  This is one of the only sequels I've read were I can say that you don't need to read the prequel at all to understand it.  I had forgotten many of the events from \\"The Relic\\" and still enjoyed this book.  While a background of the characters helps, I would certainly say it's not a requirement.  The other great thing about this book is that, while many sequels for this genre simply put the same monster in a different settings or make it a bit tougher, this is different enough where you don't get that bored feeling of deja-vu.  I spent much of the book wondering what exactly was terrorizing underground New York and trying to figure out what it was.<br /><br />While this wasn't one of the best books I've read, I did enjoy it enough to continue withe Preston and Child's \\"Agent Pendergast\\" line and get the next few books about him.  If you're interested in that character, I'd definitely recommend \\"Reliquary,\\" although you really don't need to read it in any kind of order to enjoy it.	2005-07-12

The plot sounded promising, and I was hoping that Brown could weave in some conspiracy-theory backstory to it to make it even more interesting.  While \\"Deception Point\\" is a decent thriller, it never goes the extra distance to become anything more than that.  The book starts off very strong and I read through the first couple hundred pages in one sitting, but after that some of the intrigue that was built up early on is lost when Brown reveals what's actually going on and we learn the secret behind the object found in the Arctic.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Deception Point\\" would make for an above-average made-for-TV movie, and is a decent suspense novel, but doesn't come off as exciting as his other works.	2005-06-27

I had heard this story was good but put it off for a long time. I came away from reading it with the same feeling I got from DaVinci Code, a hunger to learn everthing I could about the people and places featured in the book and a thirst for a sequel, which is always a sign that I've read a good story.<br /><br />Although I didn't think that Brown did very well with the character development in this story, and this book didn't have as many shocking moments as \\"DaVinci Code,\\" I enjoyed the story more and it was more thrilling. This book was a lot like an educated man's Robert Ludlum: fast-paced and filled with suspense, while containing everything you find in a good issue of National Geographic.	2005-06-21

I've also been fascinated with Loch Ness and cryptozoology for several years, so I was very excited upon learning that the author of \\"Meg\\" would be approaching Loch Ness. At the same time, I felt some trepidation over this since I didn't enjoy the last Alten Book I read (Resurrection) and I didn't want him to screw up one of my favorite subjects. Thankfully however, not only does Alten \\"not screw up\\" with \\"The Loch,\\" but it is one of the most enjoyable fictions I've ever read.<br /><br />\\"The Loch\\" follows the same pattern as Alten's first book \\"Meg.\\" Scientist/protagonist discovers that there's a mysterious creature in the water that's killing people and it's up to him to find it. Alten sets this story up by having the main character, Zachary, return home to his native Scotland after a few failures in his marine biology career. The book progresses with his usual formula of several more attacks, along with personal conflicts that Zachary must deal with at the same time.<br /><br />While not as scary as his Megalodon books, I found \\"The Loch\\" to be just as enjoyable because of the great set up for the explanation of Nessie, and was very satisfied when the truth was revealed toward the end of the book. Alten also manages to weave in a historical back story revolving William Wallace (of Braveheart fame) that fans of authors James Rollins and Dan Brown will enjoy. I definitely enjoyed every chapter of this book and would really like to see a sequel if that's even possible.	2005-06-06

The first chapter of this book starts off great, and really builds a lot of intrigue.  The rest of the book however just seems to fall flat.  It keeps building up ideas but it never really explores them in much detail. Jeff Long will introduce one concept about this mysterious race that lives underground, spend a couple of paragraphs on it, then move to something else.<br /><br />Most disappointing was the end of the novel. I couldn't believe it when I had 10 pages left, wondering how in the world the author was going to resolve this story in 10 pages.  Well, he did it by a very anti-climatic finish, as I expected.<br /><br />This book had some really good potential with the concept of a new race that lives beneath the Earth, but it's just not explored as well as it could be.	2005-05-29

I love cryptozoology fiction, but Sasquatch isn't one of the more interesting legends in my opinion.  But even still, I thought it would be a fun read.<br /><br />The story starts off okay and does a pretty good job of developing the main characters and creating some human conflict. The only problem is the vast majority of this story is about that conflict, and not the sasquatch.  If this was a movie, the sasquatch would get maybe 5 minutes of screen time.  It's a story about the main character (George Kodiak) trying to get away form the bad guys, and oh yeah, a sasquatch happens to be wandering around.  That's a slight exageration, but I really was disapointed with how little was focused on the beast.  Even withoutthe cryptozoology backdrop, it would be a slightly interesting read, but not enough to keep me excited for very long.<br /><br />The description lists this as \\"the first in a series of adventure novels that chronicles the exploits of George Kodiak\\" however no other Kodiak books have been written in five years, and I really don't see him as interesting enough to focus an entire series around, which is unfortunate because a cryptozoology expert could make for some pretty exciting adventures. \\"Where Legends Roam\\" is an okay read, but not enough for me to recommend it to anyone or get excited about a sequel.	2005-02-26

Almost as if Alten said \\"okay, I need a human villain, let's pick...this guy!\\" and drew someone's name out of a hat. It distracts from the real story, which focuses on the destruction of the Megalodon shark.<br /><br />My other problem with \\"Primal Waters\\" was that it was a little too far fetched. I know the concept of a prehistoric shark is hard to believe anyway, but at one point in this story, someone is swallowed by the shark and then escapes out of it's gills. Shortly before that, someone is actually riding the shark on top of it's snout. I almost wouldn't have been surprised to see someone surfing the spout of steam from a whale's blowhole.<br /><br />A few elements of the story are pretty fun if you can suspend your belief in reality and just take it as a fun summer novel, but compared to the first two novels in the Meg series, \\"Primal Waters\\" just isn't as exciting, suspenseful, or plain scary like it's predecessors. Jonas is too old to be an enjoyable character, and hopefully with the next book Alten will bring some fresh blood into the story.<br /><br />The books in the Meg series (ordered chronologically) are:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005HRSXJ6 Meg: Origins]] (Short Prequel)<br />[[ASIN:1599551691 MEG: A Novel of Deep Terror]]<br />[[ASIN:0786011149 The Trench]]<br />[[ASIN:0765347857 MEG: Primal Waters]]<br />[[ASIN:0765365855 Meg: Hell's Aquarium]]<br />Meg: Night Stalkers (To be published in 2012)	2005-01-04

I had read Airframe, Timeline, Jurassic Park, Andromeda Strain, and Sphere and I loved them all. Prey is a mediocre novel, that just doesn't hold up to Crichton's past works. The subject of nanotechnology sounded like it could be interesting, but I found myself fairly bored with it the whole time. Crichton didn't \\"sell\\" the story to me like he did with his past ideas. I didn't feel as if it was plausible at all, possibly because the concept of nanotechnology is so new that no one really knows much ab out it. Looking at all of the works he cited, it looks like he did a LOT of research into his subject. So why are there so many problems with the logic in it?<br /><br />It seems like Crichton has become somewhat formulaic in this book. The book clearly mimics many of the themes, plots, and cliffhangers from Jurassic Park, but lacks the overall threat of 60 foot tall T-Rex ready to rip your throat out. It's hard to develop suspense in a novel where the main threat is microscopic (although it was done in 'Strain effectively, so why not here?)<br /><br />If you're a fast reader and want something for the weekend, it's not a bad read, but I wouldn't suggest spending any time or money on Prey.	2004-10-10

Definately in my top 5. In addition, I've read every other book Alten has written, which is why it pains me so much to write a negative review, almost as much as it pained me to read \\"Resurrection.\\"<br /><br />I normally don't buy books, but instead check them out from the library, and if I do buy a book, I wait until it comes out in paperback. I loved \\"Domain\\" so much that I pre-ordered \\"Resurrection\\" months ago. Probably the first hardcover book I've bought in years. The story gets off to a good start, but falls apart after the first few chapters. This book is nothing like Domain. Whereas Domain had a great Mayan/Alien storyline, Resurrection almost completely abandons this and shifts over to a plot involving aliens, time travel, and Heaven & Hell. The word \\"Mayan\\" appears in this book maybe 5 times. No more visits to Chichen Itza or theories involving the Yucutan crater, which is what made Domain such a great book.<br /><br />Resurrection focuses mainly on Michael Gabriel's twin sons, and what I think is their quest to free their father. I still don't know if I have any idea what the book was really about. Characters that seem important, are introduced, built up, and then killed or removed a few chapters later. Alten focuses the first half of the book on the twins, and the latter half on the aliens, in what comes off almost as two completely different books. He introduces the concept of wormholes, time travel, species evolution, the afterlife, and so many other concepts that will have you completely confused as to what is going on. All of this culminates into one of the most anti-climatic endings I have ever read. I actually started reading a new book with 10 pages to go because it felt like such a chore to finish it. I have been forcing myself to read 2 or 3 pages a night so I can be done with it.<br /><br />As I aid, it hurts me to give my favorite author a negative review, but this book is truely deserving of it. While I don't doubt it will appeal to some, I didn't buy it for a space fantasy. I bought it to recapture all of the great memories I had from reading Domain.

This book is loaded with pictures and art and I spent a lot of time just admiring how nice it looked.<br /><br />Secondly, all of the pages are formatted as \\"practice tests, fun facts, workbooks,\\" etc, so you can pick it up and read a page or two and put it down again, which is perfect for people who don't have a lot of time to get involved in a lengthy book.  Most of the jokes are timeless so you don't have to worry about it being out of date after the elections.<br /><br />Lastly, the book is pretty neutral when it comes to the satire.

I have been out of comic books for about 10 years, and never got into the X-Men seriously, but with the success of the movies, I wanted to pick up a few books and start reading.  I bought all of the previous issues of the original X-Men series, however the idea of having to read through 30 years of comics and mediocre art from the '60s really turned me off. Not to mention all of the complicated story lines and past events.  I was very pleased then to be able to pick up Ultimate X-Men and start completely fresh with the X-Men.<br /><br />To start, this is an excellent series.  I've read all of the issues so far and \\"The Tomorrow People\\" is definitely the best storyline so far.  We are introduced to the current X-Men team, who are a bunch of teenagers.  We're given some limited knowledge about their backgrounds and introduced to their abilities.  Most you will be familiar with if you're read the original X-Men, although I've noticed that Wolverine is definitely darker in this book, as well as many other characters.  They have no qualms about killing people off in \\"Ultimate,\\" and nothing they do would surprise me.  This is contrasted by the usual humorous elements of Marvel Comics, as well as the personal relationships and teenage romances they set up.  In a lot of ways, this comic is like the X-Men Evolution cartoon series with their handling of the more personal side of the characters.  It can be a bit of a soap opera, but it works very well.<br />The storyline of this volume is excellent.  It's packed with a great introduction to the kids, as well as a Xavier that appears to be a bit more devious and \\"human\\" than seen in the traditional Comic.  Wolverine is definitely the character they've played with the most.  He is just absolutely dangerous in this series.  I thought this was the same old Wolverine that I grew up with from the Marvel Universe, but \\"Ultimate\\" Wolverine is just a plain loose cannon.  Like the other deviations from the traditional universe, this works very well in this series.  It lends an aura of excitement that I can't recall feeling in the past.  My one concession with this series is that the covers are really bland to me, and too much like paintings, and some of the artwork in later issues by Bachalo looks really bad.  I mean Rob Liefeld-bad.  Kubert does a great job with the pencils in this one however.

This book features the popular \\"Weapon-X\\" storyline from the traditional X-men comics, with some drastic changes.  Purists of the X-Men will probably be very upset, and those that are relatively new to the X-Men (like myself), will be a bit let down.  The new Weapon-X storyline that writer Mark Millar has decided to create is just not as good as the original.  \\"Weapon-X\\" was one of the main sagas in X-Men, if not all of the Marvel Universe.  I didn't read X-Men, but I can remember the excitement surrounding this storyline and how much it made me want to start reading X-comics.  Millar's version of it is rather boring, and there is too much of a focus on the other mutants rather than how Weapon-X relates to Wolverine.  Wolverine's past is explored much more in later issues of \\"Ultimate,\\" and I feel it was just a bit too soon in this new series to explore it. It all leads up to an anti-climatic finish with some rather large holes that don't make much sense.<br />The storyline is written by Mark Millar and most of it is pencilled by Adam Kubert, who has done a decent job with the X-Men in my opinion.  While it's not the best storyline featured in Ultimate X-Men, I would recommend anyone who enjoys the series to pick it up, but I would encourgae you to start with the first book \\"The Tomorrow People\\" and reading the series in order.  If you have a limited budget though and can't purchase all the books, you won't really be missing much by skipping this one.	2004-06-16

This book is loaded with full color glossy photos of some incredible looking dishes. All of the recipes have exotic names and look like something you'd find at the best restaurants in New York. 'Flavor' would look great on any bookshelf or coffee table, however it is not very practical as a cookbook. The information in it is a very overwhelming and not something the average person is going to be able to make. The recipes are difficult, and call for a LOT of ingredients that you will have to look up and go out of the way to find. It also has a wierd color \\"flavor index\\" that is very confusing.	2004-04-27

Thankfully I had the sense to borrow it form the library instead of purchasing it.<br />\\"Hell to Pay\\" was insanely boring.  This would be the perfect novel to turn into a Steven Segall movie because it is already lacking a plot.  Pelecanos jumps around way too much, and at too many times when he should be fleshing out the story more or adding some more action, which \\"Hell\\" is seriously devoid of.  It seems like he used this book as a chance to describe the seedier side of Washington and to mention all of the urban hip-hop artists he knows rather than trying to tell an entertaining story.	2004-04-19

What a great idea for a fiction writer to do right?  Unfortunately, I was caught up in the tremendous amount of hype that surrounded this book and failed to see the glaringly obvious flaw: this was a FICTION writer.  This fact becomes painfully clear on the first page of the book.<br /><br />\\"Portrait of a Killer\\" would make for a somewhat decent work of fiction.  It would make for a mediocre \\"historical\\" fiction novel based on a real event.  As a \\"non-fiction novel, it is absolutely horrible, and definitely the worst non-fiction book I have ever read.  I've never read a Cornwell novel before, but it seems that she is trying to use real people to create fictitious characters.  Walter Sickert is the man she is convinced held the secret identity of Jack the Ripper.  Cornwell's entire premise for this book is that she would be using the scientific method, and more interestingly, DNA analysis, something that has never been done on the Ripper case.  When her DNA analysis and scientific studies fail, she STILL uses the unconvincing results to try to draw definitive conclusions that Sickert was the killer.<br /><br />The DNA \\"evidence\\" that is Cornwell's main link to Sickert and the Ripper, is actually mitochondrial DNA, or mtDNA.  This type of DNA is actually very common, and is shared by anywhere from 1-10% of the population.  Furthermore, Cornwell cannot even state with certainty that the DNA she tested was even Sickert's.  How does she explain away all of the eyewitness alibis Sickert had for 4 or the 5 murders, placing Sickert in Paris at the time?  She doesn't, she simply ignores them.  Her ENTIRE book is based on a wide amount of circumstantial evidence that doesn't even come close to being \\"scientific.\\"  Most of the letters she attributes to the Ripper have been widely recognized as hoaxes by the Ripper community.<br /><br />From reading her book, one would think that Cornwell had some sort of personal vendetta against Sickert, as she attempts to portray him as an insane psychopath.  What does she use to support this claim?  Mainly Sickert's sickening tendencies to take walks at night or paint!<br /><br />Cornwell failed miserably with \\"Portrait of a Killer.\\"  She attempted to spend 1 year stepping into a completely unknown field.  A field that has been explored by people studying the Ripper and the evidence for decades.  Her only advantage over other authors on Ripper books was her budget and access to Ripper documents and testing laboratories.  However, when this fails to turn up a single bit of conclusive evidence that Sickert could even possibly be the killer, Cornwell loses her ground and proceeds to recede back to what she does best: writing fiction.  Even if her evidence proved without a doubt that Sickert was the killer, the book is so horribly written and jumps around so much, there is no way I would ever recommend it to anyone else.<br /><br />Update: 1 Jan 2012 - This is still in my top three of worst books I've ever read.he Ripper have been widely recognized as hoaxes by the Ripper community.

I didn't read it then, and now I understand why he chose it.  His thinking must have been that any 7th grader who could complete this book must be a genius, and he was prepared to reap the scholastic benefits of making this discovery.<br />I have picked this book up several times in the last 15 years in an attempt to finish it, or to leave it casually on my nightstand when I wanted to impress someone.  Unfortunately, I believe my main problem with trying to finish this novel is that I'm just not smart enough.<br />\\"Alexander of Macedon\\" is a very detailed account of the life of Alexander the Great, and to a lesser extent, his father, Philip.  If you've ever wanted to know everything there is about Alexander, this is the book for you, and is probably the most exhaustive text available.  It is thoroughly well researched and is loaded with sources.  It is evident Greene spent his time putting it together.  I would not recommend this book to anyone who simply wants an enjoyable biography of the man however.  This book is an incredibly difficult read.  New battles and people are mentioned every other paragraph, and it takes at least 100 pages just to get into anything interesting.  I was mind-numbingly bored out of my skull for the first 50 pages and was incredibly confused before Greene even got to talking about Phillip.<br />I imagine once the movie comes out next year, many will be looking to expand their knowledge on Alexander and learn more about him.  As I said, unless you are really obsessed with the man and want to know every detail of his life, I wi=ould look for a simpler read. This book is not written for a general audience and any exciting facts or stories about Alexander are buried under mounds and mounds of historical data.	2004-04-16

Each page lists space to record info for 3 days of running, and has a quote about running or a tip off to the side.  While the tips are helpful for new runners, and the book might be a nice motivational fctor, there is really nothing here that you can't find off the Internet by typing in \\"running tips\\" in a search engine.<br /><br />If you don't have Internet access, it would be a decent book, but Runners World's own web site (and many other sites) has a much more comprehensive online training journal that can not only log your runs, shoes, and routes, but provide detailed reports and graphs as well.<br /><br />The price of the book is low enough so that it's not really a bad deal, just a little behind the times.

I'm not a huge Campbell fan, and I always hated the Evil Dead films, but I do enjoy seeing him in films, and I grew accustomed to his work on Hercules and Xena.  By the end of this book (which took 2 days), I found myself enamored with Campbell and renting every Evil Dead film and B Movie he's been in.<br />This novel is more of a tongue-in-cheek biography of Campbell's life than a confessional \\"tell all\\" about Hollywood. While Campbell does mention 2 or 3 tidbits about some well known actors in Hollywood, don't expect a \\"tell-all\\" book filled with gossip.  The second thing this book is not, is a \\"how-to\\" guide for beginning actors.  Campbell provides some pointers and suggestions for new actors, as well as tips that have helped him, but they are mainly given in context with his experience in the industry.<br />That being said, \\"If Chins Could Kill\\" has a lot of appeal for anyone who's currently trying to get into showbiz or has any interest in Hollywood.  Campbell's anecdotes kept me entertained for hours and I found my fascination for this industry increasing with each page.  The book reminded me of a better written version of William Goldman's \\"Adventures in the Screen Trade\\"  It will apeal to die hard Campbell fan, as well as budding thespians and anyone who enjoys watching E! Television.<br />I was very surprised with the quality of this book.  Campbell is an excellent writer and I found myself admiring his journalistic abilities even more than his acting.  The chapters are short and flow very well together.  The book starts out rather slow as he describes his childhood, but after the first few chapters he meets up with the Raimis and his adventures in film really begin.  I found myself appreciating \\"The Evil Dead\\" so much more after hearing Campbell describe what went into the making of this cult film.  Campbell also does an exceelent job of porvinding an honest look at the struggles of \\"B\\" actors.  I've always looked on actors as having great jobs: do something you love and then take home a huge paycheck, a notion which was dispelled for me after hearing him break down what happens to his salary after the check is cut.<br />My only problems with the book, was that Campbell seems to jump from story to story in many of the chapters, and some anecdotes seem out of place.  Campbell will be discussing a movie in one paragraph, and then in the very next, will discuss something completely different.  This can seem a little unusual with no use of line spacing after paragraphs, but doesn't necessarily detract from the book.  Some tales are thrown in this way and only discussed for a few sentences, and seem out of place when looking at the book as a whole.  But this also has the apeal of apearing very informal, almost as if Campbell is relating the stories to you in person.  Some better quality photgraphs would have been nice, ands more picture of Bruce as well.  The book is loaded with pictures but they can appear a bit grainy, and many are irrelevant.  This especially seems strange given how beautiful the book jacket is, and the high quality paper used in it. That seems like a wierd thing to say, but this is just one of those books that you just like to feel and flip the pages because it's put together so well.<br />Overall, I found this to be one of the most entertaining biographies I've ever read, and definately the best look at Hollywood I've seen.  Even if you have no idea who Bruce Campbell is and no interest in acting, I'd recommend picking up this book to get an honest, entertaining, inside look at the life of a successful B movie actor.also does an exceelent job of porvinding an honest look at the struggles of \\"B\\" actors.

As usual with Cussler novels, it starts out with a disastrous event that Pitt finds himself coincidently in the middle of.<br />As far as Pitt novels go, this one wasn't bad, but definately not the best.  All the usuals are here, including Pitt's relationship with Loren Smith, his best friend Al Giordino, and James Sandecker.  The great things about this book is that it's long and filled with action.  As usual with Pitt novels, 500+ pages that are filled with action is enough to keep you entertained for a long time.  Too long unfortunately.  I thought that they could have done without 100-150 pages in this book.  It actually took me 3 months to read.  Usually when I get a good book, especially a Pitt novel, I'm done in a week.  I think I was bored with this one because Pitt was facing a human enemy and searching for a human threat.  The past novels have always featured some strange phenomenon or Pitt discovering some famed treasure, which make for a great read.  Facing off against the Japanese made it just like any other novel.<br />My other problem with Dragon is Pitt's love interest.  In the past novels, Pitt is always introduced to some new woman.  The same goes here, but her character was really poorly developed.  It pretty much amounted to nothing more than a single sexual encounter, which isn't like Cussler.  The last few pages of the novel do feature enough intrigue and suspense though to make me want to pick up the next novel right away.<br />If you're a fan of the series, I definately suggest picking up \\"Dragon.\\"  But if you're looking for a good Cussler novel to wet your teeth with, I'd suggest skipping this one and going straight to \\"Pacific Vortex.\\"	2004-01-22

I've read Atkins, and been on his program for 6 months and lost 50 pounds, and now under the advice of my doctor, I'm considering switching to South Beach Diet for lifetime maintenance.<br />This diet is a bit less restrictive than Atkins.  The main differences between this diet and Atkins is that you're allowed more cheats occasionally (such as sweets). You're also allowed more vegetables than Atkins, as well as breads and grains in moderate amonts.<br />The difference is, you will be more successful with Atkins if you have a lot of weight to lose.  To make it simple, if you have the willpower to stay with Atkins, you will lose more weight in a quicker amount of time. If you have less weight to lose or don't think you can maintain your willpower, SBD might be a better alternative.<br />That being said, my reason for 3 stars is due to the writing style of the book.  Unlike Atkins, Agatston does not back up many of his claims with examples or scientific data.  He just states them as fact.  Secondly, he blasts Atkins' diet, when his is virtually identical. Having read both books, it's almost as if he took the Atkins plan verbatim, and then halfway through it decides to throw in a few grains and fruits. He also mirepresents the Atkins diet as allowing zero carbs, when it actually allows up to 100 carbs a day in later stages. My biggest problem with the book however is that he makes virtually no mention of exercise!!!  Regardless of what weight plan you're on, especially low carb, you HAVE to exercise!  This is a cardiologist for crying out loud.<br />The pros of the book: As I said it's an easier plan to follow, especially for lifetime maintenance. It also discusses fats more in depth than Atkins and goes into why some saturated fats are bad, and which fats are good and which to avoid.  Atkins doesn't discuss saturated fats too much in his book.<br />My best advice though, is to definately read Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution in addition to this book, even if you have no plan on doing the Atkins diet.  Although this book is pretty much worthless.  Everything you need to know to do this diet can be found on their official web site.  If my rating was solely for the content in the book and not for the program as well, I would give it 0 stars.  The menus are worthless, and the entire first half of the book should be tossed.  Agatston did not need to spend 320 pages describing this diet, and if he did, he should have included more scientific diet about why the diet works instead of pointless anecdotes.  If you want to do this program to see if it works, find the plan online.  If you want to do it for life, then get the book.  Don't waste your money.

Hopefully I can describe some of the differences for you:<br />The South Beach Diet (SBD) is virtually identical to the Atkins diet with a few exceptions. You're allowed more carbs than Atkins, you're allowed to occasionally cheat with sweets, and you're allowed more vegetables and whole grains. Atkins is more stricter, but you will lose weight more effectively. Both are good diets, but should be geared to different people. If you have a lot of weight to lose (40+ pounds), I would recommend Atkins over SBD. If you have more willpower, I would recommend Atkins. There is zero allowance for cheating on the Atkins plan, unlike SBD. But that is one of the main reasons you will lose more weight.<br />Even if you're thinking of starting the SBD, get this book in addition to it and read it. Atkins writes a very thorough book with great recipes and a very good explanation of why many carbs are bad and how the whole fat-burning process works. This was lacking severely in SBD. This book is filled with well documented research and examples of why this program works, and why the critics are wrong.<br />I've lost 50 pounds on Atkins in 4 months. If you're worried about how all the eggs and meats will effect your cholesterol, it will decrease. Studies have proven that all forms of cholesterol except LDL drop significantly on Atkins when compared to low fat diets. My cholesterol improved by 40%.<br />I do have a few problems with the book. A few things are unclear by Atkins in terms of the rules of the program. He states that controlled carb products with sugar alcohols (food made by Atkins Nutritionals Inc) are acceptable on the program, but doesn't state why. He should have spent more time discussing sugar alcohols. He also spends very little time discussing saturated fats, and only a few paragraphs on the importance of exercise. These points should have been brought out more.<br />Regardless of which diet you're thinking about doing, I would recommend reading this book anyway as it is an invaluable resource for ANY restricted-carb diet. Ultimately, do not listen to the critics, because there is way too much inaccurate and misguided information out there. Do your own research, and you will see what is true, and what is fabricated. Unlike what the media portrays it as, Atkins diet is not a diet where you &quot;can eat bacon and eggs all day.&quot; It encourages a diet with a generous amount of complex carbohydrates (vegetables), exercise, and lots of healthy fats. One thing is true however. If you do this diet exactly as stated by the book, you WILL lose a lot of weight, and will lose it fast. I have seen thousands of testaments over the various message boards, and very few instances where people failed on this diet when following it to the letter.ve been brought out more.<br />Regardless of which diet you're thinking about doing, I would recommend reading this book anyway as it is an invaluable resource for ANY restricted-carb diet.

A year after reading it, I can't really remember too much of the plot except for the main story. I couldn't remember Ben Gannon's name, or who he was trying to rescue and why.<br /><br />What I do remember is that the story bored me. I bought it because I have a large interest in sharks, and have thought the idea of bull sharks being able to transition to fresh waters is fascinating. Of course, I figured a title like \\"Shark Lake\\" would be filled with shark stuff. The sharks take up maybe 30 pages in the book, and the book wasn't really about sharks. It was an action/adventure story about a rescue, that happened to have some sharks in it. Kind of like an episode of MacGyver, except with less duct tape and more sharks. That being said, I tried to still enjoy it as an action/adventure story.<br /><br />I didn't feel that the main character, Gannon, was very well developed. I wasn't very interested in him, and there were weak attempts to create a back story involving his love life. I don't even remember who the villain was in this story or how he died, but it must not have been very exciting to me not to have stuck in my memory.<br /><br />While I don't really feel I wasted my money, I would have rather checked this out from the library than spent money on it. It's a decent novel, but there are thousands like it and Ben Gannon is more of a \\"poor man's Dirk Pitt\\" (from the Clive Cussler novels).<br /><br />If you're a fast reader and just want to pick this up for a day at the beach, it's not a bad read. But don't invest too much time or money into it. While the book was okay, I don't have any interest in following up on the adventures of Ben Gannon.	2003-12-23

Had this book been written by Robert Jordan and published as a Wheel of Time novel, it would have been flambayed.<br /><br />The use of the English language is absolutely horrible, for all the reasons described in the reviews below, and I blame this not on Paolini's education, but on his editors, who failed to clean up this book into something readable.  Maybe some of you can get past it, but I couldn't.	2003-12-10
US	51835976	R11GI1TAAZLQWM	0785112693	181836857	Marvel Masterworks: The X-Men, Vol. 3	Books	5	10	13	N	N	An Excellent Compendum	This Masterworks edition features The original X-Men series (later titled 'The Uncanny X-Men' numbers 22-31.  For $35, it is definately a great buy. Although Stan Lee ends his run as writer with issue 22 (taken over by Roy Thomas), the stories remain great and Jack Kirby's artwork is impressive, even for 30 years ago.<br />Unlike the Essential X-Men series, these Masterwork editions are in full color with glossy covers.  If you're looking to elarn the histroy of the X-Men or are new to the series and can'ty afford spending the money to buy all the old issues, this is the place to start.  I definately recommend getting the first three Masterwork editions and then following up with the Clarement &quot;Essential&quot; books later to learn all the important storylines.	2003-12-08

I picked this book up because I'm into cryptozoology and I really liked Rollins' book, Subterranean.  While the book was intriguing and fast paced, I didn't enjoy it as much as Subterranean or some of the other cryptozoology stories I've read.<br />The characters aren't that well developed. I didn't feel much for Nathan Rand, the protagonist of the story and didn't have too much of an attachement for him or feel like I knew him that well as the story went on.  I didn't really care about his relationships in the story or if he lived or died, and I thought a couple of Rollins' other characters were much more intriguing.<br />The story is a bit too fast-paced with catastrophe following catastrophe, and the dangers of the Amazon just weren't that exciting to me.  The &quot;secret-twist&quot; that many of these cryptozoology books have wasn't that interesting to me and didn't really make up for the storyline.<br />While this wasn't the best fiction I've read, it was somewhat entertaining, just didn't quite live up to the hope I had for it.  I won't let it dissuade me from reading other Rollins novels however, I just won't be picking up a sequel if one comes out.	2003-11-30
US	51835976	R17T9CKCEWRGU9	0385504209	315416156	The Da Vinci Code	Books	5	0	1	N	N	A great read	Not much I can say that hasn't already been said.  The great thing about this book is that it's one of those books that gets you excited about reading and the subject material.  After reading this book I wanted to get my hands on anything related to Da Vinci and Jesus Christ's origins that I could.  It ultimately led me to read several other books and watch a bunch of TV specials just try and recapture the enjoyment I got from reading it.	2003-11-26
US	51835976	R32DN0TXMN182J	0765340240	959103132	Goliath	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Another Great Steve Alten Novel	I picked this book up not because I have any interest in submarines or Tom clancy type books. Military Novels and science fiction books like this usually turn me off, but I got this book because I've read Alten's past 3 books, and they were the best science fiction I've ever read.<br />I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with Goliath.  It is a bit of a different scope from Alten's other books, but has the same great style and sense of excitement. Once I got into it, I had trouble putting it down.  And while I'm not usually interested in things like submarines, I find myself doing hours of research on the Internet about the new Virginia class attack submarines and the MK-48 Torpedo.<br />Alten's extensive research into this technology, and the startling turns he takes regarding nuclear war were gambles that paid off in Goliath.  Had this been the type of novel I'm usually interested in, I would have given it 5 stars instead of just 4.  But that last missing star definately hs nothing to do with a lack of great writing by Alten.<br />If you enjoy this book, I recommend checking out Domain as well.	2003-11-03

It was probably the first sci fi novel I have ever read. I'm really glad it was Hubbard who introduced me to science fiction, and I'm glad I read the book before I knew anything about Scientology or Hubbard, since it gave me the chance to go into the novel unbiased.<br /><br />The great thing about the Mission Earth series is, as others have mentioned, it's told from the first person POV of Soltan Gris, a conniving, weaselly, agent who uses blackmail, extortion, and murder to try and maintain his power in the agency over Jetro Heller, the James-Bondish \\"hero\\" of the series with the Devilish good lucks and amazing talent. The great thing about Hubbard's writing, is that you don't root for Heller to succeed. Seeing everything from Soltan's point of view creates a lot of sympathy and draws your favor toward him.<br /><br />The entire series can get a bit monotonous at times and hard to make it through, but I can never forget the guilty pleasures and immense enjoyment I had when I first started reading this series.	2003-10-01
US	51835976	R1BUROCGDMMKEL	0312981260	559539342	Temple	Books	4	3	4	N	N	A pretty good archaeological thriller	Reilly writes a decent novel with a fair amount of action and mystique, however some of the action events and stunts in the novel are a bit ridiculous and unplausable.  At one point, a character jumps from one plane into another at 20,000 feet.  If you're a fan of Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer films and dont' have a problem with suspending your belief in reality for awhile, the novel offers a good read, especially to those interested in cryptozoology (the study of mythical or extinct animals).<br />The only problem I had with the story is that it is about 100 pages too long, and at times is a bit convuluted.  The novel could have ended around page 350, but just when you think it is over, Reilly adds another twist (for better or worse is up to the reader) that keeps the story going.<br />As a fan of science fiction and expecially archaeological fiction, I did enjoy the book and will look into some of Reilly's other novels.	2003-09-14
US	51835976	RL6N4CO3C67SK	0425169367	420963473	Atlantis 1	Books	2	2	2	N	Y	Not what I expected	I bought this book based on the customer rating it's received on Amazon.com. That's the first time I've been steered wrong. I was looking for a good book that combined current mysteries (like the Bermuda Triangle) with Sci Fi and alternate explanations for these mysteries. The connection the book tries to tie to The Bermuda Triangle is very weak. The mystery surrounding it was not built up well at all, and in my opinion, Donegan set up the plot very poorly.<br /><br />You kind of spend the entire book wondering what's going on, only to get to the end and wonder where the rest of the book is. If you're prepared to read this as a series and follow up with the other books, it might be worth it, but the main problem is that the book abruptly ends with nothing really tied up. Even other novels that are part of a series try to finish the novel with some bit of settlement, however the last page of this book could easily be the end of a chapter. And the plot was not enough to convince me to follow up with the series.	2003-07-29
US	51835976	RMMUJ9HB2EWZX	0142000027	443672209	The Hunter	Books	1	1	4	N	Y	Not much here for Tasmanian Tiger enthusiasts	I am intrigued by the thylacine and cryptozoology. I was very interested in a fictitious book about the possibility of this animal still being alive, and a hunter trying to catch it. Unfortunately, that's only used as a backdrop for the real story, about the hunter.<br /><br />When I first received this book I was surprised at the brevity of it. It is paperback and 170 pages long. It took me all of three hours to finish it. The bulk of this book has nothing to do with thylacines. I would estimate maybe 30 pages worth of material has any mention of the animal. The main plot revolves around Leigh's \\"hero\\" and his emotional problems. I use the term \\"hero\\" in quotes because he's not really a hero, unless you consider someone who is trying to terminate the last animal of an otherwise extinct species the hero. He kills numerous animals in this book for sport and boredom. The main plot revolves around his time living with a severely depressed woman and her two crazy children. Leigh tries hard to tie this into the subject by having the woman's husband supposedly killed by a thylacine. What's worse, is that Leigh doesn't really seem to know how men think, and tries to write her male character by having him express his stereotypical sexual interests over and over, which have nothing to do with the story.<br /><br />If you're looking to buy this book because you're interested in thylacines or hunting, I would definitely stay away and just browse the Internet instead, you will find it much more interesting. Overall, I was very upset to be mislead into thinking I was buying a fictitious book about thylacines as opposed to what I got: a poorly characterized novella that tries to explore a relationship of a hunter and goes nowhere.	2003-03-10

As good as [[ASIN:1599551691 MEG: A Novel of Deep Terror]] is, this book is even better.  Instead of focusing on the giant Megalodon shark, Steve Alten's sequel has several plot lines and focuses a lot more on the people in the story, with a back story that is just as suspenseful (if not more) than the shark's.  There are a lot of elements in this story that reminded me of a Bond movie, and when combined with the danger of a prehistoric shark swimming around, I found myself racing through it to find out what happens next.<br /><br />The books in the Meg series (ordered chronologically) are:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005HRSXJ6 Meg: Origins]] (Prequel)<br />[[ASIN:1599551691 MEG: A Novel of Deep Terror]]<br />[[ASIN:0786011149 The Trench]]<br />[[ASIN:0765347857 MEG: Primal Waters]]<br />[[ASIN:0765365855 Meg: Hell's Aquarium]]<br />Meg: Night Stalkers (To be published in 2012)	2002-09-23

I'm almost finished with the first book and I love it, even though I never would have guessed I'd be a fan of Christian literature and have limited familiarity with the New Testament and Revelations, but the ideas expressed in these books have really made me re-evaluate my life and I don't think any other book has had such a powerful impact on me.  The Left Behind series takes the outline of Revelations and brings it to life to create a thrilling and interesting read.  Although I have to admit, the writing can be a bit mediocre at times.<br /><br />Update May 3 2012: The first 7 or 8 books of the Left Behind series are great, however be warned that the series, in an attempt to squeeze a couple more books out of a planned 10-volume set, takes a turn for the worse after that and the plot starts to fall apart.  Like many fans, I invested a lot of time in this series, only to be disappointed with the ultimate d&eacute;nouement.	2000-07-28

The movie was terrible, while this book is an excellent work of fiction, and probably one of the best science fiction novels I've ever read.  This is one of the rare instances though where I think a movie has actually had a negative impact on the novel, because it's difficult to get the characterizations that Travolta developed out of your head.  If you can somehow get that out of your head, Hubbard has really written a great piece of science fiction.	2000-07-18

Bite Me! provides an excellent companion to the Buffy the Vampire Slayer and an early look at the life of Sarah Michelle Gellar while she was on the show. A 25 page biography of Sarah Michelle Gellar, a web site section, and a great episode review for the first season. Beyond that, it likely won't satisfy many people, especially since it is now (2009) outdated and all of the information contained in it can easily be found on any comprehensive Buffy or Sarah Michelle Gellar site (much of the material was already pulled from the smgfan site).<br /><br />Edited October 2009	1998-10-11

If you're an avid Titanic fan and have read everything else it's a decent buy seeing as how most of the photographs that you see of the Titanic came from this man, but the pictures aren't very dramatic and it's not a good place to look if you want a good summary of the Titanic and what happened.  I'd suggest \\"Illustrated History of the Titanic\\" for that.  This is mainly just a collection of photos of some of the people on board.  Rather dull.	1998-03-11
