We are in the far distant future in the last days of the earth before the sun goes nova.  The sun is so much hotter that all animal life has died and plants have taken over the earth making it an incredibly lush green jungle.  All animal life has died but one species -- man -- and he is barely hanging on, literally in the branches of the great banyan tree that spans the continent.  It's this view of man, not as lord of creation but as the last survivor of the animal kingdom that gives the book its power.  That and the image of a green earth that is an incredibly dangerous place.  It's a plant eat plant world.  We follow the adventures of a boy as he discovers the world and we start to follow the adventures of some other humans that get accidentally taken to the moon by a mile long flying vegetable that is one of the stunningly creative ideas in the story.  I gave the novel four stars instead of five because it is too short.  With everything that happens you expect a grand ending and instead it feels rushed.  The adventures on the moon are cut short and forgotten and the boy's adventures seem abruptly ended with a kind of conventional happy ending.  Despite this one great flaw, this is a book well worth reading for it's sheer generosity of imagination.  In it's own unique and crazy way, it's a classic.	2002-03-20

It is Glenn Seaborg's autobiography (completed after his death by his son).  He helped develop the atom bomb, won the Nobel Prize and had an element named after him and those are only a few of his many achievements.  He also chaired the Atomic Energy Commission, was chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley and was a professor whenever there was a lull in his career.  He worked to make science interesting and accessible to the public, especially to students.  An idea of how well he succeeded is shown by the fact that this book actually makes the science of the atom bomb intelligible.  This is a book that can be read on many levels.  It can be simply a history of the atomic age for he was there at the very beginning.  It can be a history of the changing political scene during his life.  It can also be read simply as the history of a thoroughly decent person.  Glenn Seaborg comes across as a nice guy, the sort of person you would want as a next door neighbor, and would definitely want as a teacher.	2002-02-09

Of course the details and the background are different from today's world, but the problems Carol faces are ones that any girl can recognize.  She's a little shy, a little awkward with people her age for she's been raised by her grandmother.  Fortunately, she has a close friend in Penny, a bubbling, happy girl from a large and loving family.  Carol is spending the summer with her.  She struggles to fit in with Penny's friends.  She is shyly interested in Penny's older brother and doesn't know if he likes her or not.  She has an ongoing worry about her father.  Since her mother died, she's hardly seen her busy father and wonders if he loves her or has forgotten her.  Naturally all of the problems are worked out and it makes for an enjoyable easy read.  I first read this as an early teenager, fell in love with it, discovered it was the first book of a series and patiently tracked down the rest.  Meanwhile, I reread this one several times.	2002-02-08

It's too implausible for a reader of mysteries to believe.  However, it's a true story about several odd groups of people who went to live on an island.  The story sweeps you along, building to a still unsolved murder or murders.  Part of the fun is coming up with your own explanation for what happened.  Someone was lying, but who?  It's also interesting to find out who of the settlers actually stayed and founded a colony more or less by accident.  All in all, a good book to curl up with on a cold winter night by the fire.	2001-12-28

Starting with Sarah at the age of 10, it tells the story of Sarah and Abraham.  Sarah springs to life from the very first page.  Abraham, while more of a sketch and seen only through Sarah's eyes, is a vivid outline.  To successfully describe a deeply religious man, one who spends hours every day in prayer, is an almost impossible task, but Card succeeds.  In the same way, it seemed impossible to make the pharoah who holds Sarah captive for a year into a real person but the pharoah of Egypt and his court and his motives make complete sense.  Card successfully avoids cliches.  The Hagar-Sarah relationship is also well-done and becomes, through the character of Hagar, a searing commentary of the effects of slavery, abuse and powerlessness on the human soul.  Sarah is kind to her slave Hagar and Hagar simply cannot accept the unfamiliar kindness.  Card makes only one departure from the Bible.  He makes Sarah's sister also be Lot's wife.  This works very well up to a point.  The sister, Qira, is a good foil for Sarah.  Her selfishness points up Sarah's generosity and loving nature.  Unfortunately, Qira's character is so bad that she stops being a real person.  However, that's a minor flaw in an otherwise good book.  At the end of the novel, the author makes comments on the writing of the book and how he solved the Biblical-historical dilemnas.  I highly recommend reading that section as well as the story.	2001-12-16

From there, he and his two best friends decide to get away from it all with a boat trip up the Thames River -- and that's the book.  It's full of one hilarious episode after another with little side tidbits on the historical places they pass on the Thames.  Those few who have found the book dull need to understand that the story is written at the pace of a boat trip and not a television sitcom.  It's any vacation where everything goes hilariously wrong and if for once the tent doesn't fall down in a pouring rain or the boat manages to not run into another boat, the narrator remembers another trip and tells the story of carrying an incredibly smelly cheese home--Warning don't read that chapter in public.  People will wonder why you're rolling on the ground laughing hysterically.  There's also a dog who's idea of being helpful is bringing a dead rat to add to the stew.  The only weakness of the book is that I'd like to have seen much more of the dog.  On the serious side, Three Men in a Boat proves that humor based on human nature is timeless.  Also on the serious side, if you want a good look at how people lived in 1890, this book actually gives a vivid picture, including the nostalgia that the narrator feels for &quot;the good old days&quot;.  He finds life in 1890 too fast paced and with too many inventions coming on too fast.  It makes you wonder at what point people will look back to 2001 as &quot;the good old days&quot;.	2001-10-17

James Scully, the poet-translator, has done the impossible, he's turned one of the world's oldest dramas into a can't-put-it-down pageturner.  If you've never read the Prometheus or read it and found it dull and archaic, read this translation.  Additionally, there's a fascinating discussion at the end of what territory the next two plays in the Prometheus trilogy probably covered and this includes all the fragments of the other two plays that have been found.  It was a great loss to Western Civilization when the rest of the trilogy failed to survive the Dark Ages for all the fragments hint that, where the play we have is pure defiance, Prometheus as the lone rebel against tyranny, the trilogy as a whole was about reconciliation, the ability for irreconciliable opposites to come to terms with each other without surrender or compromise.  Still, even without that, the play we have gives an overwhelming image of the unbreakable human spirit and that alone makes it well worth reading.  Prometheus Bound in a good translation is a must read.	2001-10-03

Williamson is a very generous writer.  You begin with a group of children living on the Moon.  They are clones and they are learning from their clone &quot;parents what happened to the earth.  The earth has been nearly destroyed by an asteroid and it will be their job and their successors to terraform the earth.  After that, we're off and away to the earth.  Terraforming, I should warn, only takes place offstage.  Williamson is interested in the strange creatures who have evolved out of the destruction, such as the exotically beautiful girl who literally floats down out of the sky.  The book is barely a novel for it's really a series of adventures separated by thousands of years.  This is why I gave it four stars instead of five.  Anyone of the adventures deserved to be a full novel and as a result there's an episodic feel to it plus the characters are only sketches, especially the women.  That aside, it's a great, fast read.   Williamson has been writing for a staggering 70 years now (published first story in 1928!).  He gives a unique vision in this novel.  It begins like a standard disaster Science Fiction story then veers close to fantasy and then close to space opera and at the end a rather stunning epiphany for the ultimate fate of mankind.   He's a good enough writer to make it all work.  I can't help feeling that his writing could be pointing the way for a new direction for science fiction writing, one that takes the best of every era.  So with the one reservation that it's a bit sketchy and episodic, I highly recommend this.	2001-09-28

The book is a must-read for any Anne McCaffrey fan, but will leave any such fan saying &quot;More!  More!&quot;  It tells in brief her family background and the story of her life in a series of family anecdotes and his own favorite memories of growing up with his mother.  What is in the book is lovely and charming and interesting and often quite touching, but it is disjointed and reads more like a sketch than a real biography.  What you are left with is a sense of what an interesting person she is and how much you'd like to hear more, to have a really well-rounded portrait.  That lack is why I gave it only four stars instead of five.  Still, you are left with a new awareness of how incredibly brave Anne McCaffrey was and is.  She wrote her wonderful dragon stories under the worst possible conditions -- an unhappy, difficult marriage, raising three children, one quite ill for some years, frequent moves, the death of her father, serious money worries.  Through it all, she kept writing and was clearly an excellent mother.  That alone makes her an inspiration.  Read the book knowing its limitations and enjoying learning some charming fragments of a life.	2001-08-04

The science in it actually deserves 5 stars.  It's sad that it's such an evil book for the descriptions of the comet slowly approaching across the eons is are wonderful and the outline of the story would be perfectly okay, except that it is permeated by an almost unbelievable level of ugly racism.  I don't normally call books evil but the degree of racism in this story is evil because it is throughout the book.  It's very sad, really and also frightening.  I doubt the authors ever considered for a moment the ugly stereotyping every time a token member of another race shows up.  In the same way, it's a little dismaying to see so many readers giving rave reviews to this book without even mentioning the racism.  It is why this kind of novel is truly evil in its effect.  Because it's a good old-fashioned riproaring adventure story with exceptionally well-done scientific explanations, readers can get involved in the story and ignore the offensive elements and the result is desensitization to an issue that should never be ignored.	2001-06-14

Before I read this, I read and thoroughly enjoyed a number of the company stories, such as last year's &quot;Son, Observe the Time&quot;.  The idea was great and the historical research absolutely meticulous and accurate.  I had high expectations for this novel.  I would say that the idea of the company works better in the story form than the novel. However, that's the only criticism.  This novel is far above the average.  If you love historical novels, it's worth reading for the absolutely accurate recreation of the Inquisition in Spain and Tudor England under Bloody Mary.  If you like historical romance, there's a lovely, sad, doomed romance (What happens if an immortal cyborg falls in love with a mortal man?).  There's humor, much from the endless contrast and tension of immortals struggling to blend into Tudor society.  There are many telling moments.  Probably the absolute best for tension and horror are  the opening chapters when a small child falls into the hands of the Inquisition.  The sick fanaticism and twisted logic of the Inquisitors makes for tense and horrifying reading.  Everything that follows is a bit of an anticlimax.  The idea works better as short stories, but is still well-worth reading.	2001-06-10

Unlike most works with Atlantis in the title, the author has examined all the evidence and dismissed those that are clearly fanciful or that cannot be proven.  He reaches a very intriguing conclusion about the possible location of Atlantis.  However, the bulk of the book is a study of the possibility of early trade between New World and Old.  The author wisely examines evidence such as genetic similarities in plants instead of wasting time on the shaky evidence of Roman coins, etc.  He brings up some little known shipwrecks that really need to be examined since they appear to be the wrong ships in the wrong places.  All in all, the author is completely persuasive on his evidence for very early trade and less so for Atlantis itself, but even there he provides material for examination and debate.  This is probably the best study yet on the subject.	2001-04-28

The plot revolves around both stopping the aliens and finding out what the aliens really are and why they are attacking.  It all adds up to a page turner.  At the end, all the major plot threads are tied up, but enough loose ends are left for a sequel.  This could easily be the start of a riproaring series.	2001-04-28

This book is unique and fascinating--The kind that nags and nags at you.  It takes the old thought &quot;If only I could live my life over knowing what I know now&quot; and plays it out over and over.  Having died middleaged with an unhappy marriage and a stymied career, our hero wakes up in college with his whole life before him.  He promptly makes himself rich and famous but then he dies again and is reborn again.  What makes the novel fascinating is that the author does not cheat.  He does not stop.  Our main character seems trapped in an endless time loop--or is he?  Suddenly, new factors enter and...well, I won't spoil the plot.  This is a must-read and would be a great novel for discussion.	2001-02-28

However, readers be warned.  You must remember it was written in 1919.  Stereotypes abound.  Women are voluptous, wear very little clothing and are either totally good or totally evil.  If you can make allowances for all that, then it's a thoroughly enjoyable romp and the author's imagination is stunning.  Today, he would place his adventure on an alien planet.  In 1919, the vast uncharted regions of the Pacific were vast and alien enough to contain lost races, lost civilizations, unimaginable science, etc.  My recommendation is to suspend all disbelief and critical judgment and simply enjoy.	2000-12-28

When it first appeared in Astounding Magazine, the title was We Have Fed Our Seas.  It's a quote from Kipling that will make your hair stand on end when you read it in the context of the story.  I can't explain it here without spoiling the plot for the quote gives the theme.  Briefly, the story begins by introducing four men from utterly different backgrounds who are going to spend a few weeks doing research manning a space ship.  The idea here is utterly fascinating.  The space ship carries a matter transmitter that lets people move easily into space.  People come and go routinely--and then something goes horribly wrong.

As a big fan of the Miles' series, I was dismayed and disappointed to read that A Civil Campaign would be a romance.  A romance!  I do not like romances!  But a friend loaned it to me, and I grudgingly opened it and...and...the book reached out, grabbed me and wouldn't let go until I finished it.  Bujold takes the romance conventions and simply uses them to frame a wonderful story.  There's a dinner party that I can only compare to Charlie Chaplin at his best, i.e. just when you think nothing else could go wrong--something else does until just about every guest at the dinner party is just about ready to kill every other guest.  This is definitely a &quot;don't miss&quot; for Miles fans.  I would not recommend it though to beginners in the series.  I think it would be hopelessly confusing.  For anyone who hasn't read the series, I suggest starting with Shards of Honor and working your way down through the series.  Know that I and the other fans envy you as you read these stories for the first time.  But for long-time fans like me, don't let the fact that its a romance stop you.  This actually is one of the best in the series.  My only concern is that Bujold is tying up all the loose ends too well.  Is the series ending?(Tell me it ain't so!)	2000-11-20

His life is utterly changed by an admirable young man who is simply kind to him.  What you may be asking does this have to do with the title?  Mary Shelley is being sneaky here.  She pulls you completely into the narrator's life.  You and he barely notice when someone mentions a plague in China.  Here the comparison to the AIDS epidemic is all to apt.  A plague is advancing.  The end of the world is at hand and no one pays attention because it doesn't directly, personally affect their lives.  Suddenly, the plague is everywhere and then, too late, the human race scrambles to find a way to survive.  It's a very profound, very sad book, well-worth the effort.<br />Written in 1826, this is, as far as I know, the first novel to take up the subject of a deadly plague that threatens the survival of the human race.  Potential readers need to be warned that the writing style takes an effort to get used to.  There is nothing wrong with it.  It's simply different from a different age, the age of the Bronte sisters and Jane Austen.  It is well worth the effort.	2000-09-23

Fritz Leiber's Spacetime for Springers is about an ordinary home as seen by the family cat.  It is the only story told by a cat.  The other stories in the first section are about how people in space are affected by their cats by authors like Heinlein and Clarke.  The second section of the book is a little strange as it has stories about catlike aliens such as the k'zin.  These are very good stories, but they are not really cat stories.  Overall, this is an enjoyable anthology of excellent stories for anyone who likes cats.	2000-09-22

I  disagree with the other reviewer here for the stories are about people  coping with disaster, trying to find ways to salvage something out of the  wreckage.  The stories are divided into two categories.  The first stories  in the book are about how man brings disaster on himself (nuclear war,  overpopulation, etc.)  The last half is of disaster coming upon the earth  (asteroid strikes etc).  What makes the stories enjoyable is that they are  about survivors, not victims.  In fact, one story details a desperate plan  to avert the threat of overpopulation -- at a terrible cost.  Most of the  stories really fall into the action/adventure category with the stakes  being extremely high.	2000-09-06

The authors of Understanding the  Difficult Words of Jesus argue that that is why so many New Testament  phrases and especially the words of Jesus sound so strange or awkward or  just plain confusing.  The authors make a very good case that the Gospels  were originally written in Hebrew and then translated into Greek and too  often the translator gave a literal translation to what was a Hebrew saying  or idiom which means it doesn't make sense in English.  The authors do an  excellent job of placing Jesus in his proper historical context, as highly  educated in both the study of the Torah and in the culture of his day.  We  cannot grasp His meaning without keeping in mind the Jewish roots to all  His teachings.  The book is too short, only 169 pages. While this makes it  a quick and easy read, it also leaves the reader wishing for more and  deeper exploration.  This is a good book for a beginner who wishes a good  tool for understanding the New Testament.  The last 50 pages are an  Appendix which gives examples of what the authors see as the true meaning  and proper translation of some of the most obscure Biblical passages.  One  could wish the Appendix were twice as long, but it makes a good, sound  introduction to the subject.  Highly recommended.	2000-09-03

The plotline is familiar.  It shows a very dark view of ordinary people trying to cope with the end of the world.  That is well-done but it is the fact  that the collapse of civilization is not from nuclear war or such but from  a simple virus.  The virus kills all members of the grass family.  When you  consider how many major food crops would be affected and then the domino  effect of the loss of feed for animals, you are reminded of how truly  vulnerable life on earth is and how easily the balance can be upset.  I  don't know if John Christopher was being prophetic or simply wanted a  different sort of disaster for background, but with today's concerns about  viruses, the book is chillingly real.	2000-07-18

It is a shattering story and the Introduction by  Kenneth Reckford in which he examines the meaning of the play is worth the  price of the book.	2000-07-16

In the Townhouse, she begins with an ordinary English peasant, Martin Reed, as narrator.  He describes how he rose to  wealth and built the townhouse.  The story then switches narrators  to fill in the story as the years pass, but the last word in the novel  belongs to Martin as a wise old man.  A wonderfully vivid picture of  medieval England is painted along the way and we meet some equally vivid  people.  Along with the realism, there's a touch of the supernatural.  It's  a shame it's out of print.	2000-07-12

Few authors besides Poul Anderson would attempt it.  That he doesn't quite succeed, doesn't change how wonderful the underlying idea is.   Earth detects evidence of another civilization 5000 light years away and  decides to send a contact ship.  Even though the round-trip will take  10,000 earth years, the crew will only age two years.  The crew is chosen,  the trip begins and after 6,000 years they realize the alien civilization  may not be there and the trip might be futile.  They go on and find three  alien races and meanwhile earth is changing.  The surviving crew members  will return after 11,000 years to an utterly changed world.  All this is  well-done but the idea is greater than the execution.  The book cries out  for a Dominick Flandry or a Nicholas Van Rijn or some really interesting  central character or a really intense story line.  Instead, you are  introduced to some well-sketched-in but not very interesting people with  not very involving personal problems.  And the story is episodic, although  some of the episodes are wonderful.  Poul Anderson seems incapable of  writing badly.  His second best work like this is far above your average  science fiction.  I highly recommend this for the ideas and the images of  future worlds while being aware that you're taking a long interesting  journey with some not very interesting people.	2000-07-11

Here he seems to have  fun with the silly Adam and Eve story, and turns out a solid, exciting  story.  Earth is destroyed.  By chance a space ship with an all male crew  and a spaceship with an all female crew are out exploring and escape the  destruction.  Their problem is that they don't know the other ship  survived.  They have to look for survivors and find out how to defeat the  enemy. Obviously, if each ship doesn't find the other, the human race will  die.  Or if they find each other they still have to create a safe place in  a hostile universe.  With all these problems as background, the result is a  good old-fashioned adventure story.  And it's extremely refreshing that the  women have adventures as well as the men.	2000-07-08

She made a good story out of the  most unlikely subjects.  Madselin is a minor story but well worth reading.   It begins with Madselin in an impossibly difficult situation.  The time is  two days after the Norman Conquest of England has reached her backwoods  area.  Her husband has just been killed and she is hiding in a convent.  At  this point, she doesn't have a future and certainly no possibility of  happiness.  She'll be lucky to stay alive.  The novel is how this rather  spoiled and sheltered 17 year old girl creates a good future for herself  and those around her.  Norah Lofts takes many of the conventions of the  average romance novel and then turns them around by looking deeply at her  characters.  Madselin is forced to marry a conquering Norman noble, only  he's not a noble but a decent rather bewildered young man not quite sure  how to be a conqueror.  The growth of their relationship forms the meat of  the novel.  There's an underlying grim realism that keeps the story based  in reality.  This is a world of poverty and brutality.  Madselin had  disliked her elderly husband.  In a nice touch, she only came to love and  admire him the day he went out to fight the Normans and is killed.  She,  all along had been in love with a young warrior whom she suspects is now a  mistreated prisoner.  She has to work out how to help him and how that will  affect her marriage.  While this is not a great book, it's well-worth  reading and it sheds light on a very obscure period of history in an  interesting way.	2000-07-08

Letter from Peking turned out to be one of the most deeply moving love stories I've ever read  and I still remember it after all these years.  It goes deeply into both  the joy of love and the high price you have to pay and, quietly in the  background, the quiet miseryof life without love.  At the beginning of the  story, an American woman living with her teenage son in New England is  waiting with a desperate grief and hope for a letter from her husband in  Peking.  She had had to leave for her own safety when the communists took  over.  Her Chinese husband could not bear to leave his homeland.  He loves  China too much to be separated from her even though that means separation  from his beloved wife and son.  The story then recalls their meeting and  decision to marry despite the problems of an interracial marriage.  It  becomes a beautiful tribute to and description of a loving marriage that is  eventually torn apart by the greater love of country.  Meanwhile, the  teenage son is growing up and falling in love with a shallow, pretty girl.   The mother has to agonize over whether this marriage will be a tragedy.   They love each other now, but is this a healthy love?  Can it survive the  pressures put on an interracial marriage when it seems more infatuation  than love?  This question haunts much of the novel as the mother agonizes  over what to do.  She makes a courageous and painful decision to intervene  in a way that will resolve the relationship even at risk of alienating the  son she adores. Meanwhile, the long-awaited letter from Peking has arrived.   This book is a must read for anyone who likes a genuinely mature love  story.  I might add that, believe it or not, it has a happy ending.  The  happy ending is again based on the happiness that maturity, love,  acceptance and wise choices can bring.  It's a shame it's out of print for  this is a book well-worth reading and rereading.	2000-07-03

It tells the story of Joseph of Arimathea, beginning when he runs away from home at the age of 12.  His father is a bitter man who wants to keep his son safe on the farm  in Arimathea.  (His own father had been murdered by the Romans by order of  Herod).  The adventures of young Joseph as he learns to be a sailor are  marvelous as is the background.  The Mediterranean world ruled by Rome  comes to life and you are absolutely there.  Not content with that, we also  travel on a secret mission to Great Britain for tin, but the author  obviously loves the politics of Rome.  I've seen the famous &quot;I,  Claudius&quot; and got confused.  This novel covers much the same period of  time but makes a lot more sense.  The rulers of Rome seem like real people,  as does Joseph as he rises to power.  Joseph wants to beat the Romans at  their own game so to speak, following the old cliche that &quot;the best  revenge is living well&quot;.  He works his way up to wealth and power to  the point where it seems perfectly logical that that the Emperor Augustus  should turn to him and ask how his old friend Herod is!  All that is  interesting and most novels would end here, once Joseph has made it to the  top.  However, he is also a religious Jew, or would like to be.  Something  that gives the novel power is his endless struggle to figure out what  compromises he can make and still be Jewish.  That's a modern struggle.  He  never finds an answer.  He reaches middle age and feels a little empty and  dissatisfied.  Then personal tragedy strikes and he becomes desperate to  find meaning in a life suddenly meaningless.  One of the many strengths of  A Love Divine is the way it gives feel of Roman politics and how inevitably  they were leading to the crucifixion of Jesus.  Unfortunately, by this  time, we are at page 516 and suddenly the story speeds up.  Joseph becomes  a Christian, decides to be an apostle, tries to preach, starts traveling  and we rush along not having time to get to know all the new people and new  situations that are being introduced.  From here to the end the novel is a  little disappointing in comparison to the first 500 pages.  The story being  told is so vast and sweeping that it cries out to be two novels or even a  trilogy.  Too much is crammed into the final 200 pages so the result is a  novel that is merely good instead of superlative.  It is still one of the  best historical novels I have read and highly to be recommended just on the  basis of the vivid picture of the times.  It can be read with enjoyment  just for the history, although you'll be left remembering Joseph and  several dozen of his friends.	2000-07-02

The story is placed in the near future when the moon has a colony and tourists.  The nearest Kip thinks he can get  to the moon is by winning an old spacesuit in a contest.  The whole opening  of the book is his cleverness and resourcefulness in figuring how to win  the spacesuit and then in repairing the old spacesuit.  Heinlein has a lot  to say here about the importance of independence, resourcefulness and  initiative.  The lesson the book gives is that if you want something, go  for it.  Heinlein gets in some real swipes at the public school system that  are as valid today as when it was written.  His solution, if you feel  you're not being educated in school, continue to attend school but educate  yourself.  Read, look up information.  This doesn't mean the book is dull.   All I've mentioned only begins the adventure.  Having fixed up his  spacesuit to the point that it's spaceworthy, Kip one night wears his  spacesuit and turns on its radio, intercepts a call for help, tries to  rescue a kidnapped girl who is fleeing her captors, gets kidnapped himself,  gets his wish to go into space in a way he never dreamed of and suddenly  the rest of the book is non-stop action.  The scope of the book suddenly  takes a giant leap out into the universe, a universe filled with alien  races who frankly don't think much of the humans from earth.  In a very  moving scene, it's up to Kip to present a defense of the human race, with  his life and the life of humanity hanging in the balance.  It's a wonderful  story and as good today as when it was written. If you have preteens who  are ready to &quot;graduate&quot; from reading Harry Potter, this is the  perfect book.	2000-06-25

It is also amazingly well-written and shows Louis L'Amour to have been a thoughtful, philosophical man as well as an adventurer.   Ironically, I haven't read his novels.  When I tried to after reading this  book, I concluded that his autobiography is a far greater work than his  novels.  I suspect that's because his own life story is a far greater story  than any fiction could possibly be, plus he focused mainly on the western.   I really wished he had branched out into the historical novel.  He started  to with The Walking Drum but that was at the end of his life and he didn't  have time to follow with more novels that would cover the history of the  world. As the other reviews emphasize, he began his wanderings at the age  of 15 and from then on educated himself by reading.  As a special bonus, at  the back of the book is a list of the books he read each year from  1930-1935.  It shows how widely he cast his net.  If ever you want to show  a teenager why reading is important, give him this book with the reminder  that Louis L'Amour was a bestselling author for most of his life.	2000-06-25

Usually, you can like a novel if it succeeds at one thing; this novel succeeds on a number of levels, any one of which would make a complete novel.  It acts as  the introduction to a whole new series.  I should warn others who want to  read all five books that this is the strongest of the five.  I became  disappointed by the third in the series as it seemed to move away from the  setup in Memory of Earth.  That doesn't change the fact that Memory is  remarkable.  I notice some readers feel it is too slow.  I enjoyed the slow  careful development of a huge, interrelated cast of characters who are  remarkably vivid.  You come to feel you know these people and like or  dislike them as if they were real.  Most remarkable is the creation of a  society, the City of Basilica.  It's  a Byzantine world and it's a  matriarchy.  It's very unusual to have a matriarchy portrayed in a way that  seems real, that is, it's simply part of the background of the politics of  the city.  As if this weren't enough, there's a remarkable spiritual  dimension.  Card is one of the very few  authors willing to give his  characters and his society a spiritual life.  The relationship of man to  the Oversoul becomes at times a clear metaphor for man and God, especially  when one man receives a visionary dream that sends him on a pilgrimage into  the desert.  It's a long book but worth the journey.	2000-06-10

I found the first in the series a brilliant book, the second was imaginative and interesting and this one alternates between brilliant and appalling.  It's brilliant as  it shows the struggles of 16 members of two families (really one) who have  fled the decadent, fascinating city of Basilica to survive and flourish in  the desert.  They are guided by a vision from the Oversoul, the computer,  that they are to find the lost ships of earth, repair them and return to  earth in them.  It's a breathtakingly vast concept.  This could have,  should have been a classic.  Instead, there is much that is appalling about  the book.  There is an almost unbelievably ugly self-righteousness that  creeps in (actually it leaps in), an attitude of &quot;I'm right.  You're  wrong.  Do as I say or I'll kill you.&quot;  The threats of murder loom  over the book and are never dealt with.  Basically, Card divides his 16  people into two groups, one good and one evil.  The good people keep the  book interesting as they grow in depth and character, as people who don't  think they have anything in common become friends and/or fall in love.   However, the bad people become awful, in a very boring, repetitious way.   There is hatred based on jealousy between brothers -- hatred that leads to  murderous plots.  There is hatred based on jealousy between two sisters.   There a sameness to this hatred that gets very tiresome as it doesn't go  anywhere.  Worst of all (and a major cause of the hatred) is the  selfrighteousness of the leader.  He's the distant father-figure,  fascinating in the first two books as he becomes a prophet leading his  family on his mission to return to earth, appalling here as he literally  forces his family to follow him with threats of death.  The obvious move  would be to reach a decision point, draw a line in the sand and tell people  to join willingly or leave.  Instead, people who don't want to be there are  judged worthless and contemptible with an ugly self-righteousness, but  they're not allowed to leave.  The book becomes a fascinating study in the  birth of religious fanaticism, only it's unintentional.  It's a shame.  The  book would have been much better had everyone had to make an honest choice;  had new people been added to the group as old ones drop out; had the  struggle between whether the group would be matriarchal or patriarchal been  more fully explored, etc.  The list of flaws is very long, but so is the  list of virtues.  I think it proves that Card, even when he's on what seems  to be the wrong track, is still an amazingly great writer.	2000-06-10

I ran across it and was pleasantly surprised that it's still good.  Yes, it has a major flaw that really isn't the author's fault, the attitude towards  women.  At least the women take an active part in the story, but they're  still out of the 1950s.  That aside, this is a good account of first  contact with not one but two alien races on a planet.  The little group of  six astronauts accidentally land in a messy conflict, on top of which they  have their own conflicts within their group.  Everything is nicely drawn  and I like the fact that the end of the story is not the end but clearly a  beginning for all three races.	2000-06-10

Being written by Poul Anderson (I'm a big fan)means he has studied his history so the background details are correct.  I hope that doesn't sound dull; it's just the  opposite.  Nothing is duller or more jarring to a reader than to start  thinking, &quot;This doesn't sound right&quot;.  The High Crusade is  perfect!  The story just sweeps you along with its adventure and underlying  humor.  The humor comes out of the basic situation.  A highly advanced but  unpleasant group of aliens land in Medieval England.  Big mistake.  The  medieval knights simply clobber the aliens and steal their spaceship.  From  then on it's medieval knights conquer the universe!  Of course there's a  personal plot, a marriage that's in trouble and conquering the universe  solves that!  There's also a wonderful framing device as modern humans go  into space and run into their medieval ancestors!  Too bad Anderson never  wrote a sequel!  It's my only criticism.  I'd love to see more of this.	2000-01-04

Wondered how and why Harper Hall got started?  Thought about the implications of all male riders?  In short, if you've read and loved some of the Pern novels, you'll  enjoy this one for all the questions it answers.  At the same time, though,  it lacks any single really interesting central character or plot.  One can  hope that the author will write another book in the same era - greater  acquaintance with some of the same people would help.  The era is 200 years  after Dragonsdawn.  The next threadfall is approaching.  There's some  problems with convincing people to prepare that are nothing but a rehash of  the original stories.  The interest here lies in the fact that this is a  society that still remembers they came from earth.  Even though they have  flying dragons, the last airplane is mothballed in a museum. This is a  society that has struggled to nurture its few remaining computers and  during the novel, the last one breaks down forever.  Decisions have to be  made.  Herein lies the interest of the book.  You see a society in  transition, having to make very difficult decisions.  Overriding all, the  need to make sure the information about the 250 years cycle of threads will  be passed down to succeeding generations.  As the characters agonize over  these problems, one sees the society of Pern we all know from the other  novels take shape.  All this makes fascinating reading along with the  details of how the young dragonets are raised.  If only a really vivid  personality or two had been put in and/or a really interesting plotline  this would have been one of her best instead of merely interesting.   Needless to say, this is not a book for someone who is unfamiliar with the  Pern stories.  It's simply an enjoyable read that fills in a great many  gaps.	1999-12-19

The situation is interesting.  First you meet the heroine surviving alone having escaped slavery by fleeing into the wilderness.   Then she rescues someone from certain death who turns out to be ahigh  ranking officer of the enemy.  This has been done before but it's always an  interesting situation.  I wish the novel had stayed with this plot and  really focused on the two of them struggling to survive together.  Instead,  they both are shoved with a group of slaves onto an alien planet.  Provided  a minimum of supplies they are left to try to settle the planet.  If they  fail, they die.  If they succeed, the planet will then be conquered by the  enemy.  So they have to organize themselves, survive some major monsters  and prepare to defeat the enemy.  It's a good story but it's carried out  &quot;by the numbers&quot;.  That is, there's nothing wrong with the book  but it's definitely a hastily written lightweight read.  Which is not to  say I didn't thoroughly enjoy it.  I just wish there'd been more to it.

To begin with, it's Asimov at his best.  Except for minor lags when he pauses the story to give lots of background information, it's a pageturner.  It's also not only a love  story, it's the only one of his novels I recall where he has a number of  love scenes.  Something that I thought was a mistake -  the love interest  Noys seemed to only be that, suddenly changes in the final pages when you  realize who she really is and what she is doing.  It's Asimov at his  misleading best.  You see what's happening through the eyes of Andrew  Harlan, which means that your view of what's going on keeps changing.   Then, underlying the story is a whole other level of theological meaning.   I don't know if Asimov intended this or not, but essentially the novel,  without ever mentioning religion, deals with the old question of why  doesn't God intervene to prevent evil.  The novel shows a universe in which  men acting like gods are intervening constantly to make the universe a  better place.  Asimov shows the logical consequences, what a true horror  that world would end up being.	1999-11-25

I gave it 5 stars.  It's simply that the fact it  was written in 1911 shows -- both good and bad.  Some of the science is off  the wall, but I assume accurate for the day.  The novel has a fantastic,  hypnotic beginning set in the arctic.  Like the jungle of Tarzan (written,  I think, about the same time), this arctic landscape never existed, but  it's a fantastic place of torment for the hero.  Why is this book worth  reading?  The writing is hyptnotic.  They don't write like that anymore.   Dense, lush with an incredible poetic language, we follow the hero's  solitary wanderings across an empty earth.  This is a story of the last man  on earth.  This is a fossil, an archetype for all the later  stories about  the last man left alive on earth.  A purple cloud came by and killed all  while the hero was racing to the North Pole.  What  carries you along is  the hero's interior as he undergoes one slow painful change within himself  after another as he searches for another survivor,  Does he find anyone?   That's  for the reader to learn.  When you see the movies The Omega Man,  The Quiet Earth, The Night of the Comet(this is a comedy) and all the other  last man on earth movies, this was the great granddaddy of them all.	1999-08-17

Unfortunately, the author doesn't do nearly as  much with it as he could, but it's still a page turner.  I should add a  warning.  I read the two sequals, Beyond Eden and Future Eden, hoping the  author would correct his mistakes and write a really good book.  Alas, it's  the opposite.  They are still fast-moving page turners, but with increasing  lapses in logic and dull characters.  Desert Eden is the only one of the  three that is genuinely enjoyable (and I wish the author would rewrite it  and make a really good story out of it!)	1999-08-15

After a period of terrible isolation, he finds Em, a true survivor like  himself.  They are happy together and attract five other survivors.  A tiny  little tribe grows around them.  Ish devotes his life to trying to bring  back civilization as he knew it.  He fails at his superficial efforts at  farming and at educating the children.  He succeeds beyond his deepest  dreams at giving his descendants the tools they need to create a healthy,  happy way of life.       The novel works as a thought-provoking study of  what do you do when the world collapses around you.  It has some  weaknesses.  Here and there, the fact it was written in 1949 shows.  One  can argue that Ish would have been able to get the children to read if only  he hadn't been such a boring pedant and he could have been a better farmer  if he'd been willing to explore alternate ways and crops.  The book's  strengths greatly outweigh its weaknesses.  For one thing, with not much  action, it's a true page turner.  This is a fantastic novel to discuss and  to argue about and to ponder the fundamental question it raises.  What  would you do for the rest of your life if you survived the end of the  world?	1999-07-17

I read it 30 odd years ago and it was already 30 odd years old!  It predates E.E. Smith's better known  Lensmen series and in many ways is better.  (I don't remember the Lensmen  stories but I do remember the Skylark series.)  It begins with the classic  brilliant, slightly mad scientist, Dick Seaton, except he's young and  hunkish with a gorgeous and high-class girlfriend, Dorothy.  (Her parents  oppose the romance but she's loyal to her Dick.)  Enter the brilliant,  mad-scientist villain named Blackie.  He kidnaps Dorothy.  I'm happy to say  she tries to kick butt, kicks the instrument panel of the space ship  instead and they're off on a grand tour of outer space with our hero in hot  pursuit.  There's another girl and another guy and the book is climaxed by  a double-wedding on an alien planet with an alien race in attendance.  Of  course Blackie is defeated (but only temporarily so he can show up again in  the next book), and they all go home to live happily ever after until the  next adventure (which will occur in about 5 minutes,)  Yes, it's dated and  corny and, if you think about it, extremely silly.   My advice is, don't  think about it. Just read it and enjoy.  This is an excellent book to  introduce early teenagers to a sense of wonder and adventure and awe at the  vastness and mystery of the universe.	1999-07-17
