The sweet story of Emily Harding, thrown 100 years back in time, to right wrongs made during the Civil War is touching and humorous.  I love how pieces of the history of Cabell County WV are shown, as I grew up there.  I think this book is a excellent, and would make a great addition to any library (I even bought several as gifts!).	2004-10-12

There were a lot of ideas in this book that I already had, and a few that were new to me, but the way that Ms. Beechick weaved together the Biblical account with history and made it easily readable was just amazing.  I've read many books on this time period.  Most of them are very scholarly, which definitely has it's place, but this was a quick, light, fun read, that was still jam-packed with lots of info.  She also includes a great bibliography, so I can't wait to start researching more.	2004-07-02

Of the first four books in the Gabaldon series, this is my second favorite, easily (nothing can touch Outlander, of course).

It gave me a nice overview of where to find things, and had a nice amount of humor without overdoing it or being sacreligious.  I didn't agree with everything they said, but I'd still give it four stars.	2003-03-16

I absolutely love the way Gabaldon writes just as if she is talking to you, telling you the story of how and why and where the books came from.  I felt like we were hanging out together as I read through this book.<BR>  I won't give this book five stars, because I do think there were several things that could  have been improved (i.e. the dictionary!), and I did find some areas a little boring (the <BR>horoscope isn't my thing and I felt she rambled on about a few subjects that didn't matter, plus I think she spent far too much time trying to explain the computer).  However, I loved the FAQ and other Q&amp;A sections.  I really enjoyed reading HER answers to some of the questions I had.  I still didn't always agree with her on some of the points made in the section on things people complain about, but that's what makes the world go 'round!  &lt;G&gt;  I thought it was such a neat idea to put in the book, and she did change my thoughts on some issues (and I was with her from the beginning on the rest!).  I absolutely loved reading where all her ideas came from and how she wrote the books.<br />  I hope that there will be a final companion to the whole series and that she will take into account some of the criticism she got on this one and make it excellent.  I think this is a must have addition to any Outlander Collection.  Full of tidbits I'd never considered myself, full of wit and love and fun.  Just a wonderful wonderful companion to the series!	2003-02-20

It was so interesting to hear the stories behind all the Christmas songs.  The only reason I rated it a four is that not all the song lyrics are included.  Even when it is a song I know by heart, I liked reading through the words, especially songs that have several verses that we don't always sing.  Very sweet, easy to read, and interesting.	2001-11-23

As a fan of the Little House books, I've read Laura's stories many times.  But before she wrote them, she wrote for the newspapers about farm life.

I'd read the first two in the trilogy many times before I finally found this in a library.  Wow!  I love it.  There is so much in this book about marriage and class structure, and, of course, World War I.  I'd love to go through and put several quotes that really touched me from it, but I think you should just read the book!  And while you are at it, try to read all the Bristow books -- she's wonderful!	2001-10-16

It's so interesting to follow the Upjohns and Sheramys and see how the family changes as the generations flow by.  I always love anything set in the Civil War, and I liked how Corrie May was able to see some different truths that most people don't.	2001-10-16

This is the first of her plantation trilogy, set in what becomes Louisiana, prior to the American Revolution.  It follows the Larne and Sheramy families, telling how they carved their empires out of the forests.  It's a great love story, a great historical novel, and my favorite of the trilogy.	2001-10-16

I really feel like I know what it would have been like to live in Charleston during the Revolution after reading this book.  And the Romance!!  Ah, I love to read about Celia and the men in her life.  I also liked the way she had more than one REAL romance, something that isn't done in a lot of novels.  I thought it was very well written.  This is a must read for anyone!	2001-10-16

This was the first biography of Laura Wilder that I'd read (other than Anderson's booklet &quot;The Story of the Ingalls&quot;) and I was fascinated to learn all the little details that Donald Zochert had found.  As I understand it, he took a lot of his stories straight from Laura's unpublished first manuscript, Pioneer Girl, which makes it doubly interesting.   Although the book has several inaccuracies, it was the first biography done on LIW, and has several bits of information that aren't easily found elsewhere.  It's a must read for Laura fans, IMO (although I could do without the cheesy cover art, especially the ridiculous pictures on the back cover!).  It's very enjoyable and easy to read.  It fits in nicely between the geared for children &quot;Laura Ingalls Wilder&quot; by Anderson, and the more scholarly &quot;Becoming Laura Ingalls Wilder&quot; by Miller (both also excellent reads).	2001-07-21

A retelling of the story of Hosea in an 1850s California setting.  I felt so deeply for Michael all throughout, and I had such a hard time even putting the book down!  (I even got scared by the waiter at a drive-in restaurant today, because I got so engrossed!)

Not a whole lot challenging in it, but a lot of information.
