Ten-year-old Leslie tells her story of living in Paris for a year, illustrating this appealing odyssey with postage stamps. Her mother, father and 'baby' brother Michael and all of Paris play important roles. Her father introduces her to collecting stamps & they visit the famous stamp market, and become acquainted with several stamp sellers - - their carefully gloved hands and often gruff manners. <br /> <br />For Leslie it is a year of new sights & friendships, of a newly acquired language, and stamps chosen for the album that will bulge with special memories when she returns to the States. Young readers will share the excitement of this adventure, and maybe even feel the lure of stamp collecting. What a wealth of French artists are included! Leslie goes to the beach where her school friends swim topless & there is an appropriate painting by Ingres of a shy nude figure - - mirroring how she felt. <br /> <br />Other art is shown in a stamp from \\"Ceskolovensko\\" with a handsome magician doing an improbable card trick, a stamp from Monaco with \\"La Lectrice\\" . . .even Romanian stamps of radishes & cucumbers! I hope students (including home-schooled) are inspired to adapt their experiences in stories about their own country, state, or particular area of interest: Art, food, bridges, etc.? <br /> <br />McHAIKU has 'graduated' from her stamp-collecting days but enjoyed Leslie's travelogue tremendously, with a good topping of nostalgia. Thank you, Leslie Jonath!	2005-10-06

I rate myself among the most willing to straggle from the crowd & allow footsteps to slow (living on *Less Traveled Road* has taught me something). Give yourself up to the delights of McCall Smith's newest detective & fascinating philosopher  - - you may discover a description (pg. 145) that was immediately copied for my 'collection of clotheslines': a suit hanging on the Isle of Skye  where \\"the wind had been in the arms and legs & had given it life.\\" <br /> <br />I marvel at how the author has turned his scrutiny on the workings of Isabel Dalhousie's mind. No, she isn't  \\"nosy\\" but her curiosity does allow her to scurry as through a maze in the interests of Science & Philosophical research. Her grounded, more skeptical housekeeper, Grace, offers  humor with starch. <br /> <br />I am jealous of future *Mystery* fans who will savour the 8-course banquet someone is sure to bring to television for viewers who appreciate stars neither shallow-minded or pursuing serial partners. Also starved for more challenging fare are readers!And everyone must have something to feel guilty about, so Isabel offers clues that in her next adventure, chocolate will be generously shared as well as more thoughts about duty and friendship. <br /> <br />What do the men in this story think of Isabel and her serendipitous brain, whirring through the daylight hours like a hummingbird: no significant 'looks' missed, with occasional pauses before choosing the proper word; the gentle judgments? How can this review be launched without an appreciation of niece \\"Cat\\" and also \\"Brother Fox\\"? There are questions that surface in my mind: Is it inexplicable for a transplanted heart to trigger visions that would cause Ian's heart to feel endangered? If the story of a transplanted heart inspires the dark wrath of a possible hit-&-run driver (I still cower), what else might a transplanted bassoonist create?  <br /> <br />Alexander McCall Smith's carefully detailed appreciation of Edinburgh and its lovingly drawn inhabitants will be much of what dominates the musings of reviewer mcHAIKU while taking  *my walk to work* (pg. 215  );  how about YOU? I want you to be 'taken' by this exquisite story.	2005-09-27

One lesson we learn is that people can turn their backs on misery & injustice just as easily today as in the early 1860s. (consider the example of the Sudan). <br />  <br />Julian Lester has been a teacher. He knows how to draw students toward the discovery of Truths. \\"Day of Tears\\"  gives many opportunities for acting out the painful emotions of slavery. If Lester's writings are used this way in classrooms, there is the chance for growth, for eyes to be opened, for questioning. <br />  <br />Emma is a fictional character but becomes so very real through her musings, misery and the anger that darkens her skin & makes her clench her teeth. Oh, the rankling of always being treated as an object without feelings! Through decades anger was hidden by the practiced arrangement of facial muscles, the subservient tone of voice. <br />  <br />The book's format is unusual, dramatic - - provocative & effective. The story begins with a true event: Plantation owner Pierce Butler (near Savannah, Georgia), divorced from the well-known British actress/author Fanny Kemble, is driven by his weakness for gambling to sell most of his (approx.430) slaves in what would be known as the largest slave-auction in history. The two-day sale netted $303,850. Stark notes about many slaves are given in Lester's text, including the price paid for each. The Author's Note & excellent references (mainly online) give even more information. <br />  <br />The publisher's 'blurb' describes Pierce Butler as a slave owner who cashes in his \\"assets\\" - thereby losing his humanity. This truth is symbolized by the weeping skies. Soon after the last slave was sold on March 3rd of 1859, the rain stopped. <br />  <br />If you are a parent and/or  teacher you have a God-given opportunity & responsibility to share this book with young readers. Challenge them and be challenged yourself by their reactions and questions.  mcHaiku suggests you also read Julian Lester's \\"On Writing for Children and Other People\\"    (#0803728670).	2005-06-16

This is a book that invites participation, and reminiscing. It will send readers, laughing, to paw through drawers for their own almost-forgotten 'strips of four' . . . Photo booths did seem to give permission to be silly and inventive, and as pompous or unpretentious as one wished to be. What a wide gamut of emotions - - what an array of poses! My favorites are different each time I look through the book - those hair do's! those hats! <br /> <br />The \\"Photomaton\\" invented by an Italian immigrant in 1925 was quickly bought by a NY financier, tho' there must have been some kind of precursor? (One customer image shown above is definitely from the early 1900s.) Those 'models' looked into the lens expectantly & honestly, knowing there would be no retouch job, but maybe wishing that \\"tinting\\" was more affordable. What an aura of glamour it gave. <br /> <br />In the 30s having pictures taken was still in the \\"treat\\" category, definitely a 'lark' - -  on a par with an ice cream soda date! The selection of pictures printed on the back cover of the book do not altogether reflect the collection's breadth. Inside there are many photos of black men & women, and also much less affluent persons. They DO mirror the times. I regret they do not share space on the book's cover.  <br /> <br />\\"PHOTO BOOTH\\" is a book for sharing - - nostalgia will spill over into laughter. Imaginations may even be dusted off.

In their varied forms the inuksuk may be intended as markers for caches of food, to advise hunters of directions, or to  symbolize persons being memorialized. The last is an idea that could be used by students who want to follow the author's instructions for building a personal inuksuk. Another structure is shown serving as a road map to a traveler's next destination. It is not only a potential life-saver but makes a beautiful statement in the barren landscape. <br /> <br />Living in the Arctic means acquiring techniques for survival. Outsiders must acclimate themselves in a short time and this can  be unsettling! For many decades the U.S. War Dept. funded studies in climatology, resulting in proper clothing & more nutritious feeding of troops. One more way in which we have benefited from the insights of our neighbors to the north. <br /> <br />\\"The Inuksuk Book\\" has many striking silk paintings with a gorgeous rainbow of colors that reflect the beauty of the 'Northern Lights' (Aurora Boralis). These inspire an admiration for the mystery of the far north. Contemporary photographs and those from earlier years also enhance the text. Teachers often expand a study unit to include Eskimo/Inuit art. How fortunate the young people who become acquainted with the figures beautifully sculpted from walrus tusks and soapstone. Amazing artistry is evident in works created during the long winters north of Hudson's Bay.  <br /> <br />REVIEWER mcHAIKU marvels at the skills & imagination of the Inuit people and cheers author Mary Wallace for sharing. <br /> <br />	2005-04-16

Richard Wright grew up in the early 1930s . . . thinking that a library card was the TICKET TO FREEDOM. His mother used 'funny papers' to teach him to read but his formal education went only through 9th grade. A chance for a job took him to Memphis, Tennessee, and there he continued to yearn for books. <br /> <br />How difficult it is now to imagine not being allowed a library card because of race. Thousands of books, but only white folks could check them out! At work Richard finally approached one white man who was willing to loan his library card. Bending the truth a bit to use the card, young Richard found a new life spread out before him. <br /> <br />This 5 STAR story was drawn from an incident that Richard Wright wrote about in his famous 1945 autobiography. The books he read inspired his own talent. He worked with words all his life to express his beliefs in freedom and equality. Everyone MUST see the portrait of Wright on the cover of \\"HAIKU, This Other World\\" and be moved by that handsome face which reflects such great strength of character.  <br /> <br />Libraries are more than symbols, and books are treasures that never stop 'giving back'.

A seasoned writer, Robert Burleigh's interpretation of Admiral Byrd's confrontation with the Antarctic night is outstanding for its intended audience of 9-12 year olds, & for others including adults. The illustrations by Walter Krudop give strong suggestions of the abyssmal 'aloneness' & greatly enhance the story-telling. There must also have been an especially clever editor.    Admiral Byrd is delivered to the prepared outpost & lowers himself to a shack buried in the snow. This is reminiscent of native Americans going down a ladder into a kiva. Byrd's cave also will become a sanctuary of ritual.    Byrd is soon writing poetically of his surroundings. Do his writings speak of those who labored to build & equip the space now containing tons of food & fuel?  Outside there are weather instruments set up, from which to gather scientific information, justifying (perhaps) Byrd's personal experiment.     Byrd fights against a blizzard that takes him unawares, and against carbon monoxide fumes that sicken him almost to death. He comes to the point of being unable to stand, and crawls, still struggling to manage his contact by hand-cranked radio. Does he hope that the men at Little America will perceive his illness & depression? The narrative is interspersed with brief journal entries: The cold is so intense & terrible that outdoors he can hear  his breath freeze as he exhales! \\"20 days colder than -60 degrees.\\"    March drags on into August. He fashions a kite, douses the tail with gasoline & watches as it swooshes to the sky, blazing - -  up to a hundred feet to be seen for miles,  but for five minutes only. His desperation is acute, but then is answered by the dim light of an approaching tractor. Three members of the crew on a mercy mission! He collapses from the effect of accumulated terrors.  As light slowly returns to the bottom of the world, he is nurtured  until he can be flown back to base camp.     This book tells a challenging adventure story, especially for today's youth. The artist captured the harsh conditions and clearly portrays Byrd as a man humbled by his experiences - certainly he is less arrogant than when he stepped off the \\"City of New York\\" upon arrival at the frozen continent.    The early 30s were the days when Abercrombie & Fitch outfitted 'real' men, and pemmican & Horlick's malted milk tablets were menu highlights in Antarctica.  Robert Burleigh has achieved an honest telling of this story of courage. REVIEWER mcHAIKU, who \\"dressed up\\" long ago in seal mitts & wolverine hooded top,  will always thrill to stories of polar exploration.	2005-03-14

I think she felt the writing of these poems gave Richard Wright balance (in the  last two years of his life) while fighting illness and suffering the death of his mother. Miss Wright has written beautiful, perceptive and loving words in her Introduction to the collection of haiku; I also am grateful to (Mrs.) Ellen Wright for the cover photograph (clik to hardcover edition):    \\"Native Son, seeing                         from Mississippi clear to         Paris in spring-time.     Black Boy, self-aware,  your portrait holds me, stirring  these sad reveries.\\"       (mcH)    It is my feeling that the \\"counting of syllables\\" CAN be an exercise for healing. I promise, you will be delving into this book countless times. Haiku & senryu . . . each brings delight because inevitably the reader's imagination will be triggered by just one word, or phrase, or aroused feelings. Some believe the 'Haiku moment' comes from using words that \\"do not depend on metaphors & symbols.\\" The INTENT is to EXPRESS the 'AH-NESS.'    However it happens, read through this legacy from Richard Wright and you will experience sheer pleasure.    \\"The low of a cow  Answers a train's long whistle  In the summer dusk.\\"    817 haiku were chosen for publication by Wright from the 4000 he wrote during his illness while exiled in France. I may not follow the 'correct' study method but readers who also write haiku will recognize certain stages of progression, and repetition of certain subjects. Wright wrote often about sparrows, crows, snow, loneliness, magnolias, death, scarecrows, the moon. The following is an  amusing favorite that is considered \\"senryu\\":    \\"It is so hot that    The scarecrow has taken off    All his underwear!\\"                                                        REVIEWER mcHAIKU rarely indicates that you should avoid reading something  BUT in a positive spirit, I feel qiuite free to urge you to  MAKE  THIS  BOOK  A  PART  OF  YOUR  LIFE.	2005-03-10

Here's to COLOR, CREATIVITY & INDEPENDENT THINKING ! What fun for the illustrator, and for us all! <br /> <br />In 1956 Grandma P. left her open-road life to settle in Simi Valley,California. She needed room for her souvenir pencil collection first, and a bottle house was the result of salvaged bottles, a strong arm for mixing mortar and persistence. Her sons helped with roofing & hanging doors as her little 'compound' grew.  <br /> <br />But this was no Hyannisport! Tressa Prisbrey's unstifled creative juices led to other structures, small & tall: a house for dolls, a bottle chapel, birdbath, wishing well and a bottle Rumpus Room. There is a round House of bottles, and a Singing Tree where more than a thousand bottles hang & sing like wind chimes! She 'branched out' and used other materials, even potted cactus, and she laid pathways for the many gawking visitors & picture-takers. <br /> <br />A \\"Preserve Bottle Village Committee\\" works now to protect the future of this imaginative artistry; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. REVIEWER mcHAIKU enthuses over the author & illustrator who bring us Grandma Prisbrey's colors bursting like Roman candles: a memorable legacy for all to share. <br />	2005-03-10

Lenore Look's story of the sweet bond between Katie and her Chinese-American grandma makes one feel a delicious nostalgia, ginger and all. <br /> <br />Although I wish Stephen Johnson had painted the \\"salted butterfish & flounder that hung like laundry\\" in the tiny kitchen (!), his illustrations have a special warm expressiveness from the use of pastels with watercolors. Readers will respond to Katie's contagious smiles and feel completely drawn into her experience. <br /> <br />Look's story has plenty of realism stirred in, including the authentic 'Taishanese' dialect. Katie is with her grandmother each Saturday, after 'Gnin Gnin' has worked all week in a crab cannery. (HARD WORK as fully described by the author!) And when Katie finally realizes her dream of going 'on the job' with her grandmother she learns that sticking it out through bad smells (\\"chiubungbung\\") and long hours are the way Gnin Gnin invests in dreams of a college education for her granddaughter.  <br /> <br />REVIEWER mcHAIKU is allergic to crabmeat but is totally delighted with this wonderfully sensitive story and the eloquent paintings. <br /> <br />	2005-03-10

And of course, ART includes cooking! The area is loosely bound by RICE -- food of sustenance, and by beliefs & rituals that nourish the people's spirits. <br /> <br />1. It  Rains Fishes (Thai cookery) # 0876543565 (1995) <br />2. Hot Sour Salty Sweet  (Mekong River cuisine) # 1579651143 (2000)  <br />3. Seductions of Rice (luxurious, delicious book!) # 1579652344 (2003)  <br /> <br />I have been pursuing the weath of information, rituals & folk tales from these volumes, but oh, so slowly. (Taking a break & watching the movie \\"Eat, Drink, Man, Woman\\" [# B00005JKG1] is a good prescription to follow.) <br /> <br />Each book lifts up the Rice Goddess and the value of following an Asian diet with rice at its heart. Some of the recipes are as fascinating as the traditions & folk stories. \\"It Rains Fishes\\" has colorful BOLD watercolor paintings by T. Goodenough, & delicate companion drawings by M. DeSong which are delightful. The author is Kasma Loha-Unchit who teaches in the Bay Area & also leads discovery tours to Thailand each year. The two books by Jeffrey Alford & Naomi Duguid have handsome photographs and it is difficult to be content staying at home after browsing through these books.  <br /> <br />Aurora Ammayao is the author, and Roy Hamilton (UCLA museum curator) editor of \\"The Art of Rice.\\" Ancient antiquities connected with rice are shown with contemporary crafts, all conveying the sense of cultures centuries old, and rich beyond description. Questions come to mind about what will be there after \\"civilization\\" has sucked all the art & rituals from these people, leaving only commerce with its greed, and greater poverty. <br /> <br />Many writers have contributed to the scholarship of \\"THE ART OF RICE\\" - -  You will follow your individual leadings but these are the chapters that piqued my greatest concentration: <br /> <br />c.30, The Future of Rice: there is a photo of a freezer vault at the International Rice Genebank in the Philippines; also, a collage-like painting of \\"Golf\\" with a commentary on the loss of rice fields to those building new golf courses, mostly adjacent to the burgeoning cities of SE Asia. Someone should sell this as a poster to finance a campaign against the descecration of sacred lands. American-multinational food conglomerates continue to kill the future livelihood of native farmers. <br />c.28, Wrapping the Body with Images of Rice (Kimono patterns from the Edo period; many show sheaves of rice & wooden noisemakers \\"naruko\\" to shoo ravenous sparrows away.) <br />c.25, Straw Matters (beautiful, intricate craftsmanship) <br />c.26, Rice, Self and State <br />c. 8, The Granary: A Home for Rice Spirits <br />c.31, Let's Hope the Bile is Good <br />c.18, The Goddess of Rice <br />c.12, The Gods Walk on Rice  (Bali) <br />c.14, The Ghost Fest of Dan Sai (Thailand) <br />c.17, Of Mites and Men (Japan) <br /> <br />This book is tremendously important. All the museums I can never visit, and the glorious countryside & markets and waterfronts!

Langston Hughes was born February 1, 1902 (in Joplin MO), and his centennial was celebrated with the publication of books honoring his poetry & life, including \\"Langston Hughes, an American Poet\\" by Alice Walker . . . & also, \\"Love to Langston\\" by Tony Medina. <br /> <br />For this book the author writes poems in a style similar to Hughes' - - each being biographical. These are followed by three pages of helpful notes. Some of the dates make for surprises: In 1914 Hughes protested against \\"JIM CROW SEATING\\" in his 7th grade! In 1923 he began an odyssey to learn about the world firsthand, starting with Africa: \\"going around the world digging life, . . mining for riches\\" by observing people. <br /> <br />His poetry was influenced by Walt Whitman and Carl Sandburg, but also by the rhythms of jazz. \\"Jazz makes me sing - - the blues makes me feel . . . a whole lot better . . . hits my heart in the funny bone.\\" The bold colorful illustrations by Gregory Christie are a happy choice and complement Medina's hopeful text. This happened, too, with the 1982 \\"Langston, A Play by Ossie Davis\\" for which Jerry Pinkney illustrated the cover.  <br /> <br />In the 1950s the specter of Senator Joseph McCarthy threatened Hughes' ability to earn a living. He was quite ill in 1967 when \\"dear sweet Alice (Walker)\\" one of the young authors inspired by his works, visited him: \\" ... she brings me oranges like a bag of sun.\\" The sun can also shine into your heart through reading Langston Hughes' poetry, suggests REVIEWER mcHAIKU.	2005-03-07

He says his writing was a religious calling, one he was helpless to deny. Recently, though, . . . \\"the strength of that call has begun to wane.\\"    He was surprised years ago when his editor suggested that he write for children. He learned that finding the initial subject 'opens the gate'. He seemed to have little understanding of the significance when his first book \\"TO BE A SLAVE\\" was named a Newbery Honor book in 1969.    At fourteen the family moved to Nashville TN (his father was a minister); here he was faced with \\"the white heat of hatred\\" and negroes in whom \\"hope unborn had died.\\"( Jas. W. Johnson)  He made friends with books & discovered the courage to dream. About that time he learned that his great grandfather was a Jew from Germany. Read Lester's thoughts about the personal \\"I\\" relating to the story of his ancestors. He went on to share with his students (U Mass/Amherst) what he had learned about himself, and the conviction that it is not enough to be opposed to racism; each person's story must be lived with integrity. Take \\"the risk to live your inner truth, regardless of the consequences,\\" he said.    Cemeteries have been important to the author, and trying to imagine the stories of the dead. \\"In the storytelling experience we bind ourselves to others,\\" writes Lester, and become less lonely. Art & music were important from childhood - Lester types with musical accompaniment. He is interested in photography & shared mostly 'people pictures' in this book.     Some of this book is slow-going. Will 'young adults' check it out? Julius Lester gives many definitions of \\"story\\" . . . My preference  may not be yours, so READ THIS BOOK and savor his words. Also, read the fine review by Alison Follos, above. Julius Lester's several pages (138-147) describing the collaboration between himself and Jerry Pinkney were of particular interest to me. Their books together are successes to enjoy: the Uncle Remus books; John Henry, and Sam & the Tigers.    Julius Lester wrote: \\"Today my identity is molded by the inescapable fact that the sum of my past is greater than the sum of my future. THERE IS ONLY TIME REMAINING TO DO THAT WHICH IS MOST VITAL FOR MY SOUL'S ODYSSEY.\\"  I hope the words are not a valedictory. They hit home with REVIEWER mcHAIKU who hopes to have many days ahead in which to \\"read in order to be moved, & even changed.\\" This is a helpful, inspiring book; Julius Lester has shared generously.

We have appreciated so much  Ronald Himler's illustrations in \\"I Wonder as I Wander\\" (by Gwenyth Swain), and find a similar haunting quality in \\"The Caged Birds.....\\" Here, his drawings of young Ary and the birds in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, add color & poignancy to a simple but profound tale of HOPE. <br /> <br />Both stories are served well by pictures that illuminate a child's anxieties, determination and hopefulness. Frederick Lipp draws us into his story of families trapped by poverty and living in polluted cities where they never see the beauties of the countryside. Young Ary dreams of her family moving from the city. She saves to buy a bird, clinging to the tradition that \\"letting a caged bird . . . a blessed bird . . . go free . . . makes wishes come true.\\" <br /> <br />One day Ary studies carefully the birds before choosing one from the cage. She takes one great breath and then releases it as the bird takes wing with her dreams. The story of yearning for freedom is universal. Children will love not only the allure of another culture but also the author's gentle telling of one child's hopes following the light. Reviewer mcHAIKU suggests that reading this with children will encourage the sharing of dreams - - don't miss such a chance! <br />	2005-02-22

In his youth he became a \\"convinced\\" member of the Quaker faith. These beliefs and practices made him extremely unpopular with the ruling majority in Britain, including his father. (Happily, they were reconciled before the elder's death.) William Penn suffered much for justice & civil liberties. <br /> <br />Readers will learn that Penn was imprisoned time & again in disease-ridden and rat-infested jails. But these experiences did not scar him as the small pox of his childhood did. He is revealed as a disciplined person who would be a good role model for young readers.  <br /> <br />Penn later followed his quest to set aside land in America for other freedom-loving people. He helped the Lenni Lenape natives as well as emigrating Pennsylvanians. While establishment of the Pennsylvania colony was his great achievement, he was able to live there for only a short time.  <br /> <br />There will doubtless be some adults reading this book, who use it & the well-chosen bibliography as a 'starting place' for quests of their own. The basic truths of Penn's life and faith are depicted honestly for a wide audience. Some criticism is printed above but does not include a letter refuting it, as printed by SLJ. As for an opinion that \\"blotchy illustrations detract\\" we should all take to heart this quote from the late Richard F. Ericson, phD: \\"We cannot make value judgments for other people\\" ! <br /> <br />FREEDOM IS ELUSIVE. Learning about the sacrifices made for faith will make us cherish our own more; and hopefully, help us better understand the beliefs of others. Reviewer mcHAIKU gives FIVE STARS to the author AND to the students who learn from the life of William Penn.	2005-02-21

He was a 'militant pacifist' (an oxymoron?) when state religions were see-sawing in prominence. Kings & prime ministers fought for power, and the uneasiness among all levels of society helps explain the proliferation of religious sects in the 1600s. Cynical, cruel laws were passed to 'excuse' the jailing of believers outside the state-church-of-the-moment. Hundreds, including families with children, endured hideous prison conditions for their beliefs. <br /> <br />Fox became a magnet for the many people known as *tender* seekers for spiritual Truth. He had a certain pride that Yolen claims was \\"a fault shared with many Old Testament prophets\\"! The ministry of George Fox was an odd sort at first, according to the author. It consisted \\"of solitary walks, fasting, mournful midnight wanderings, and hours in hollow trees with his Bible.\\" He had an uncompromising nature. His preaching was rustic, yet compelling; William Penn later said Fox used \\"rough, uneducated words.\\"  <br /> <br />George Fox had 'discovered' silence while shepherding in the Leicestershire hills in his youth over 350 years ago. The very essence of Quakerism is his concept of the Inner Light: \\"I live, yet not I, but Christ in me.\\"  <br />               <br />              \\"What Spirit invades? <br />         The Silence becomes thunderous.            <br />           Why, speaking, do I quake?\\"   (mcH) <br /> <br />People listened to Fox preach for hours; in fact, Jane Yolen includes more mention of his preaching than of the silence central to the Quaker way of worshiping.  Poet John Whittier later described Quaker meetings as \\"syllabled by silence.\\"   <br /> <br />The author covers thoroughly the growth of the 'movement' and  organization, their missionary efforts in America, and long-term impact of \\"the Religious Society of Friends\\" & its compassionate arm, the American Friends Service Committee. The days of  *threshing meetings* seem so very long ago! At these gatherings the 'elders' attempted to \\"separate the wheat (those who could receive the Quaker Truth) from the chaff (those who could not)\\"!  <br /> <br />Adult readers of  \\"Friend: The Story of George Fox & the Quakers\\" will be more patient with the many repetitions than young students are apt to be. Yet all will benefit from the author's solid research, and sympathetic telling of an involved story about a person with extreme eccentricities. Few authors have 'tackled' this subject since the publication of Jane Yolen's book. Reviewer mcHAIKU urges you to read this young adult biography of a great spiritual leader, and concurs with William Penn's assessment that \\"GEORGE FOX WAS AN ORIGINAL, BEING NO MAN'S COPY.\\"	2005-02-19

And he could write! He told of Langston Hughes taking over a play rehearsal and recreating his life: those \\"sad old weary blues.\\"  From Kansas where he lived with his grandmother, to Illinois, Mexico, to New York & Harlem, to Africa, to Paris and Harlem again; then Pennsylvania, where he graduated from college in 1929. When other men were jumping from buildings, Langston Hughes continued writing. \\"My soul has grown deep like the rivers.\\"     Many named in the play as influences in Langston Hughes' life, were revered by & quoted by my father: Frederick Douglass, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Countee Cullen, Thurgood Marshall, Mary McLeod Bethune; also white poets Vachel Lindsay & Edna St. Vincent Millay. Ossie Davis opened to us a view of a previous generation, somewhat like the view from that railroad car - - passing swiftly as in a dream.     By coincidence I had again been reading the play before learning of Ossie Davis' death last week. I am grateful to him for sharing the stories of many dreams with play-goers and readers. Even more, Reviewer mcHAIKU is thankful for the lives of two great artists: Langston Hughes  AND  Ossie Davis.	2005-02-09

It seems appropriate that children learning to read be paired with stories of those who lived so courageously.     Isabelle was born probably in 1799 to slave parents who were owned by Dutch New Yorkers. She did not learn to read until she became free some 29-30 years later. \\"Bell\\" suffered the indignities of being sold over & over, but grew tall and formidable. She worked hard at tasks better suited to men, yet endured many beatings. Her yearning for freedom led her to run away:    \\"She wouldn't wait for Master to free her.  She wouldn't wait for the State of New York to free her.   Before Master awoke, Bell slipped away.  She found freedom.\\"    And, oh, what she did with it! She gave herself the name SOJOURNER TRUTH because she believed that God had called her to preach against slavery & to bring equality to women. She traveled \\"up an' down the land\\" speaking out for Freedom & Truth. In 1850 she published her own story: \\"Narrative of Sojourner Truth\\"! She died in 1883.    Gwenyth Swain's prose has a fluidity that is poetic in telling about a woman who was frequently wronged but spoke in a strong voice of \\"an even stronger faith.\\" An author who has also written about the 'president of the underground railroad' Levi Coffin, and Mary Church Terrell, an early civil rights activist, her website is a popular destination . . . especially early each month when a different *free book* is announced.    Reviewer mcHAIKU echoes Gwenyth Swain who wrote that \\"Sojourner Truth was an unstoppable inspiration to people . . . in her time & ever since.\\"	2005-02-05

Elster has captured black history in a delightful series of books about Joe Joe, a young city kid. Photographs are used to enhance Nicole Tadgell's lively illustrations.

Joe Joe is harrassed by other kids as he dreams of going to college: this, after reading about the life of Mary McLeod Bethune whose hopes were built into an 'institute' that  became the Bethune-Cookman College in Florida. The text for the \\"book\\" Joe Joe reads is actually one written by the author who smoothly inserted it in the story.    Mary McLeod Bethune was a formidable lady, and part of my growing-up \\"lessons.\\" My father loved to tell about her standing at the lectern as a guest preacher, saying \\"I AM BEAUTIFUL!\\" Her words put things in proper perspective because what was truly important WAS her message of hope. She had built her dreams from her own fortitude and sweet potato pies.    Reviewer *mcHaiku* hopes that her example will help us all be courageous when facing hurdles to education.	2005-02-05

Author Sid Fleischman calls Gennifer Choldenko's book \\"a taut drama\\" and \\"a marvel\\" . . . YES! . . .  It will really grab you. Even halfway across the country, & seventy years after the story unfolds, Alcatraz holds a fascination for many.  A friend who lived in Al Capone's Chicago \\"neighborhood\\" would have loved this  book; her stories about seeing him there made me aware of a Capone charisma.     Please read *AL CAPONE DOES MY SHIRTS* . . . ASAP! . . . then share your reactions on amazon.com! Some of you have had experience with autistic children.  I have never known anyone with this sensory disorder, yet recently I have been deeply affected - - first, by an NPR interview of Temple Grandin (who figures in Choldenko's generous footnotes), and now by reading this story about \\"Moose\\" Flanagan & his sister Natalie, growing up in the *extraordinary!* surroundings on Alcatraz Island with the families of other workers & guards. Moose is the brother who always tries to be good, especially to an older sister trapped in a disorder that in the mid-thirties was not even named. To get her placed in a special school motivated the family's move to San Francisco, and each family member tries in different ways to cope with the young girl's abnormal behavior, as well as the stresses of the 'Great Depression'.    Dependent on a ferry, the Alcatraz kids attended school on the mainland where they achieved a certain status by stretching the truth with stories of the convicts. Gennifer Choldenko draws each of her characters as tho' they were plucked straight out of OUR memories. Mrs. Flanagan cries for our sympathy as she agonizes for the child whose strangeness makes 'normal' family life impossible. Mama Capone figures in the story . . . and also the warden's cute daughter, Piper, who is adept at provoking mischief and bending her father's rules. I love footnotes the way poor Natalie dotes on indexes, and found quite moving the author's sensitivity in describing the hypnotic hold thatwords, numbers & objects like buttons had on the autistic child.    The story packs a wallop with humor, pathos, sweet understanding, the conniving of kids, and the family's struggles with wide-ranging emotions. Hurrah for books that appeal to boys . . . AND to girls & adults of all ages. No wonder the Newbery judges latched onto it ... & I'll bet they wavered when deciding on the medal winner! The author's notes are fascinating, & her story profited from her year as docent on the island (now a tourist attraction). We learn that there have been \\"Alumni Days\\" for those who once lived at Alcatraz as children! Read the last footnote & sense the hope that buoys scientists after years of working with autistic youngsters.    REVIEWER mcHAIKU wishes we could discuss 'into the night' this brilliant story. It will give (even to those from idyllic childhoods) some new insights into growing-up years. It may take awhile but this book will hit you with its significance, and IT WILL STAY WITH YOU, promises this Swami-Reviewer.	2005-01-25

Children now living in Cincinnati or Corydon or Cairo & New Madrid can try to imagine riding downriver in the early 1800s to a strange new location & life. When they landed on shore (opposite where the skyline of Louisville KY now dominates the scene)the young McClure family tore down the flatboat and recycled the lumber to build their new home! In just about that location, the unusual \\"Falls of the Ohio State Park\\" was established in Indiana during the last decade. The artist's colorful map of their journey from Pennsylvania is decorated with drawings of wildlife , including bears -- and reminds readers that even some species of birds are now becoming scarcer.    No real sense of the dangers & hardships involved comes through Sander's words but perhaps parents can talk with their children about those pioneers and how their stories weren't all told in pretty pictures. Another story (#0027436713) based on Hoosier settlers & drawn from family journals is Joanne Landers Henry's 1992 book \\"A Clearing in the Forest\\". It tells how Indianapolis grew from a clearing into a substantial city & state capital, and includes an episode about slaves visiting in a \\"free\\" state.    Reviewer mcHAIKU recommends Henry's book as well as Scott Sanders' \\"The Floating House\\" for good reading in our turbulent times, & because reading about the hard lives of pioneers may help children find a better perspective on their own difficulties.	2005-01-16

No wonder little kids love to go \\"gobble, gobble, gobble\\"!

Her personality is cultivated through lessons from the natural world. Then, following the menace of Potato Bugs, there comes the ultimate reward: that crowning comfort, mashed potatoes!

Deborah  Hopkinson is an engaging author, and is herself a prolific writer of *convincing* reviews. Her story about Fannie Farmer is a favorite of  mine & tops a list of holiday gift amusements.     In the proper Bostonian household of the Charles Shaw family, Fannie  Farmer was hired as a \\"mother's helper\\", more specifically a cook.  Mrs. Shaw expects a 2nd child; daughter Marcia is 'put out' by being  supplanted by someone who will prepare food & do many things  Marcia feels she does *extremely well* - - like polishing lamp chimneys.  This lively child, quite capable of getting herself into many  scrapes, soon converts to admiration for Fannie & her cooking. The story is  divided like a menu *from Soup to Nuts* and includes Fannie's  trademark *precise measurements* in the recipe for griddle cakes, a BONUS bound to please all readers.    The 1896 edition of the Fannie's[ASIN:0517186780 1896 Boston Cooking-School Cookbook] played an important role in my childhood. One of Fannie's *hints* incorporated  in Nancy Carpenter's hilarious illustrations is: \\"The mixing &  baking of cake requires more care and judgement than any other  branch of cookery.\\" Happily, my mother took this to heart and became  famous for her F. Farmer chocolate cakes.     Children will discover all sorts of historical objects in the illustrations - -  these will doubtless elicit giggles as well as questions and tummy  rumbles. Nancy Carpenter has made pen & ink sketches that are  oh-so-cleverly *collaged* with period engravings on a computer, then  printed and hand colored. Ingenious as well as educational, the pages also have a quaint and comical look. The match-ups of text & illustrations are  thoroughly entertaining even when readers are not familiar with the name of Fannie Farmer. I love this book and hope Hopkinson&Carpenter team up again, and soon.     Reviewer McHAIKU says,  \\"Thank goodness Fannie Farmer's cookbook was revered in our 1930's  household\\" but WHERE in the double-spread of impossibly impressive  desserts that decorate the \\"Fifth Course\\" is Fannie's (& my  mother's) prize chocolate cake?	2004-10-19

The team of Sarah Stewart and David Small produced this winner in 2001 and it's my opinion that only *The Friend* (see mcHAIKU's review dated October 3, 2004) has it 'bested'. <br /> <br />As Hannah becomes a time-traveler between two very different cultures, her level of excitement rises to test her well-schooled mannerliness. She is awe-struck and makes her discoveries seem new to us as we read over her shoulder the words written in her diary: \\"going down the street is like making a journey across the whole world. I feel like happiness has rushed up and grabbed me ..... \\" <br /> <br />There are only two small disappointments for me: I wish there were a situation in which Hannah was juxtaposed with a young city girl - - perhaps in that not-to-be-missed Chicago River boat ride - - somehow sharing an adventure which might suggest kinship despite their obvious differences. And, having recently written a review of *Berghoff's* (\\"The Berghoff Restaurant\\" of Chicago) I wish Hannah & her mother & friend had walked to that 100+ year old establishment to have a German meal - - where another comparison could be drawn. For me, the small black & white sketches of Hannah have a special appeal. Her facial expressions declare that she is a story-teller herself, and David Small makes obvious why he was selected by Caldecott judges.  <br /> <br />This book is a delight to share, and can be a conversation-starter among children raised so differently from those of the Amish faith - - they may question how Hannah could be so eager to return home to the chores she has escaped for a week, and to a culture with gender-segregated religious services, and outhouses, and riding in an oh-so-slow buggy. When picture-book-age children aren't close by I reach out to adults or eleven-year  olds & share the sweetness and strength of these words quietly enhanced by the dark blues of early morning and the jubilant sunrise. I will look for my favorite Monet-like haystacks the next time we travel north, too! <br /> <br />REVIEWER mcHAIKU is content that \\"the simple life\\" makes room for a love of books and hopes that Sarah Stewart & David Small continue their story-telling for many years. <br />	2004-10-12

Griffin shares real pain - - the kind that smarts; she shares country 'knowingness' - older than street-smarts. The author's LOL humor about the Methodists is different from the humor in a story about a well-earned rebuke given by a postmaster. He didn't appreciate INsensitivity, and deserves the readers' accolades. <br /> <br />The 1st story made me grin; the 2nd gave great satisfaction. <br /> <br />The American Art World has \\"primitives\\" but many are just pretend, by pseudo painters who wouldn't know authenticity from hay bales - - or Thanksgiving turkeys? (see cover) ! <br /> <br />C. Griffin is a writer whose words form authentic portraits of life. Her publisher provides a 'blurb' on the back cover: Don't miss their clever, questioning words. Provocative, too, perhaps suggesting that behind Griffin's words are philosophical questions that have challenged us through the centuries.  <br /> <br />A brief dialogue between Adam & Eve gives me another reason to grin but I can also rejoice as the author celebrates the beauty of southern Indiana in \\"Morning\\" and proclaims honestly a life lived in \\"Weekends\\" - \\"Yellow Walls\\" - Two Coffee Mugs\\" - \\"His Superficial Advances\\" - and \\"The Morning Witness.\\" <br /> <br />Applaud with me someone who can write honestly about \\"not-so-safe\\" topics.

It is the poignant story of little Belle's friendship with housekeeper Bea, and of a painful void being filled 'way beyond duty.(How could anyone be paid adequately for love that transcends pity and paycheck?)     This sweetest story is written for children AND adults, and may we all learn about valuing the beautiful varieties of friendship.  The ocean's healing grace is evident when each day \\"Belle and Bea, by the sea, hand in hand\\" grow in friendship and reliance on one another.     But then the day comes when little Belle challenges the ocean with her own bravado and audacity. David Small (husband of the author) paints the rescue: a scene that sums up the author's gratitude for life, for friendship.     This lovely story makes me want to be a pretend librarian and gather adult friends in a circle for story-telling. I would tell how Sarah Stewart's words and David Small's paintings grab my heart. Memories surface as I see the picture in the locket and I have a renewed appreciation for the blessedness of my own childhood.     *REVIEWER mcHAIKU* suggests you 'give yourself up' to the tears as well as the laughter in this lively, loving poem that is matched by exquisitely imaginative illustrations.	2004-10-03

I have been reading the story from my 1897 copy, described as a \\"new illustrated edition ... sure to command attention.\\" The life of a horse told in the first person is not on every child's reading list these days. It wasn't on mine years ago. This was my first reading. Perhaps I missed this classic because I didn't have the typical young girl's 'love affair with horses'. <br /> <br />*BLACK BEAUTY*  was written by Anna Sewell, an English invalid whose Quaker beliefs permeate every page. IF kids will read it, I guarantee the preachiness won't injure them! I was surprised to be so moved by the wrongs done to animals  -- all the suggestions for treating horses  more humanely translate into decent human relations now, as it did then. <br /> <br />Amazon.com states the reading level for *Black Beauty* is ages 4-8; maybe only prodigies are to atempt it? Listening to an adult read this story may help children bridge the years since \\"progress\\" brought us the motor car. Black Beauty talks with other horses about good and bad handlers and owners, and discusses all aspects of life (except mating) with friends Ginger and Merrylegs. He mulls over their temperments and his own, and the good influences of reasoning and praise. Unfortunate events caused by cruel check reins, and bits, whips, or being knocked about are part of this story. There are also exciting times of racing for the doctor, being saved from a stable in flames, or a broken bridge, becoming lame from the loss of a horseshoe. <br /> <br />I hope you won't avoid this 'classis' but will allow yourself to do some time-traveling by adventuring into the late 1800s. Listen to a horse's wise thoughts over the clatter of hooves in the streets. Later you can look up the LISTMANIA titled \\"You've never heard of a talking horse?\\" and ask with Reviewer mcHAIKU: Did the legendary \\"horse whisperer\\" grow up reading *Black Beauty*?	2004-08-18

Eddie thinks she needs that reminder to help quit habits such as tipping back in chairs, or squirreling away food in her cheeks. Wearing rubber bands and making LISTS help her move in the right direction, and liven her friendship with Sally.<br />This summer they avoid discussing Sally's vibrant grandma & her illness. Their friendship seems to call for dancing around the subject but Eddie finally demands that they talk about the possibility of death - and eventually the bond between the girls is strengthened.<br />Sally and Eddie are beautifully described: girls who are real in a sometimes surreal world, who continue to *be there* for each other when problems loom as large and dark as their neighboring Adirondack mountains. This is the story of a budding childhood friendship that grows into true affection as the girls enter their teens.<br />*SNAP* is sure to find wide and unexpected? popularity among young girls as well as older ones who remember sharing a secret shack or a meandering stream. It receives four enthusiastic stars from REVIEWER mcHAIKU who asks, \\"Why can't there be more books in this vein for intelligent, sensitive boys?\\"	2004-07-03

My favorite quotation by the artist is when she exclaimed late in life: &quot;DON'T PICKLE ME AWAY AS A DONE&quot; (p.331). Even after two heart attacks and a stroke Emily Carr was pushing herself around on a makeshift wheeled crate in order to keep painting. She died in 1945 at age 74.<br />Her paintings reflected her spirit as well as the spirit of the forests and native people she grew to love. She was intrepid; the paintings astonishing. She was 'gutsy' and her art could be disturbing. They sometimes mirrored her melancholy; hers was a lonely life. I see echoes of Barbara Kingsolver's &quot;Poisonwood Bible&quot; in Vreeland's commentary on the miserable treatment natives were handed out by bureaucrats and 'men of God'. The torments they caused!<br />Susan Vreeland was writing this book for 17 years. She said &quot;In paint and words, Emily Carr casts a tall shadow, one which has accompanied me in western forests&quot; - this from her experience kayacking  into the north country to search for remnants of the totem poles Carr had sacrificed so much to capture on canvas. <br />Some reviewers have carped about Vreeland introducing fictional characters and relationships in her story. 1st, let's remember this IS FICTION; 2nd, writers often do this to entice a wider audience. If this book serves to introduce hundreds more readers to Emily Carr and the wrongs she fought against, then I say &quot;Amen&quot; - &quot;so be it&quot;; 3rd, the author, in trying to portray the artist's spirit felt she could take 'certain liberties' because Emily, herself, altered facts and chronology in her own writings. And why shouldn't someone as passionate about her painting as Carr also have passionate relationships? One Amazon reviewer has gone a step beyond objecting to fictional love scenes; he/she ridicules the actions and language used as though anyone can say what is a &quot;proper&quot; way of writing about love!<br />Vreeland describes (Part II) Carr's experiences in France in a most engaging way. It was the time of Monet and Van Gogh although Carr did not meet these men. The author captures vividly the critical eye of Parisians and the manner in which Carr's art evolved. Carr's was a truly amazing achievement, as a Canadian and a woman, to have a painting shown in the prestigious Salon d'Automne. She returned to British Columbia with a new confidence in her technique. <br />Late in life Emily Carr was gratified to receive acclaim: &quot;Hers is the greatest contribution of all time to historic art of the Pacific slopes. Miss Carr is essentially of the Canadian West *not by reason of her subject matter alone but by her approach to it*&quot;(from the Ottawa &quot;Citizen&quot;). I find her paintings to be spirit-filled and/or spiritual (according to your individual interpretation); her colors bold and lush. When you come to the end of this book - a glorious adventure for the reader - remember it as a fictionalized account told with love and admiration for someone who lived 'before her time' and captured the true essence of her surroundings.<br />REVIEWER mcHAIKU remains in awe of the subject and heartily applauds the author.	2004-07-02

We are transported to another time with the deafening clamor of the weaving machines, feeling the weariness, the shock and confusion 13 year old Lyddie felt when she became a factory girl. We hunger with her for the kindnesses of fellow workers Diana & Betsy. We understand her yearnings for more knowledge as she listens to her friend read from Charles Dickens' \\"Oliver Twist\\".<br />Her determination to pay off family debts makes it impossible to consider joining the movement for fair labor practices but she does open her mind to learning. Her reading & writing skills lead her to other dreams. In fact, Lyddie fits the description of *a bodacious lady* at a very early age.<br />This is a story about health problems in the mills of New England in the 1800s, and child labor before laws existed for protection of the young. It touches on views of slavery, prejudices against Quakers, Irish immigrants. The descriptions of early settlers pitted against hunger and poverty, even wild bears, have a genuineness that should impress young readers who haven't experienced such struggles, or known hard labor. (It  does upset me that several student reviewers call this a 'boring' book -- how many of them ever 'stared down' a bear?) Following that episode, Paterson says \\"the November night gathered about them ... with its accustomed quiet.\\" <br />It may not be your child's choice for carefree summer reading but it won't be an unhealthy encounter! There may even be some middle-schoolers who will find tracing their roots back to New England an exciting hobby. *Reviewer mcHaiku* is thankful that a sense of humor was part of Lyddie's dna, for it helped her to be a survivor in the best sense. This is a thoughtful book with \\"staying power\\" and is highly recommended.	2004-06-24

In 1630 John Bradford was eleven, and finding it tough to be the son of the colony's high-minded governor, William Bradford. When John's mother died at his birth, he was left with surrogate parents in Holland for the 1st eight years of his life. The intervening years would inevitably make a reunion difficult and John feels almost totally estranged from his father. <br /> <br />He empathizes with John Billington who is often drunk and NOT an upright citizen. Both are frequently  reprimanded by the governor. Happily, there is a friend: Sam Eaton contributes some normality to his life. Sam's five-year-old sister is traumatized when a member of the colony is killed. The book's cover picture shows the tormented Rachel sitting in a tree, hidden from the black-hatted colonists below who are planning to hunt down the murderer, someone trusted by Rachel. <br /> <br />The book brings into focus the *ordinariness* of daily life; however, their struggles were not play-acting like \\"survivors\\" on television. The father-son conflict is not entirely resolved in the story; \\"relationships\\" were not coddled in the harsh physical and social/emotional climate of those times! <br /> <br />In an \\"afterword\\" information is given about some of the book's characters who were actually colonists. REVIEWER mcHAIKU would be interested to learn if readers are primarily boys but recommends this book to all ages, and readers well beyond Massachusetts.	2004-05-31

Here is a book heralded by much publicity; one to put on your \\"Vermeer List\\" ... It will appeal to young mystery readers & kids who relish being considered 'above & beyond' the generic middle school student. This has the lure of PENTOMINOES (for a pronunciation aid, think \\"dominoes\\") which are diagrammed in the book and even avaiilable to *move* on your computer screen after accessing the website given in the book ... plus the challenge of clues encoded in the illustrations. <br />The hero Calder invents a secret code based on the above, and his new friend Petra discusses happenings that may or may not be coincidences. In a book full of clues I wonder whether the author is dropping hints that a future book may revolve around the art of Alexander Calder and/or the artifacts of Petra, ancient city in Jordan. I was hoping Balliett's convoluted tale(as all good mysteries are?) would involve some action inside Chicago's ART INSTITUTE but perhaps in the future the author will use that setting, with a mystery about the unforgettable Chagall stained glass.<br />This book could open up discussions about art critics and art history *experts* ~ also fads in all the necessities of life, including art. The young people are students at the Univ. of Chicago's lab school, where they have an open-minded but nervous teacher; also in a 'leading role' is an elderly eccentric neighbor. The star, of course, is the painting \\"A LADY WRITING\\" by Johannes Vermeer. It disappears between the National Gallery in D.C. and Chicago. Mysterious letters are delivered and demands made. Your reading will speed up with the chase scenes.<br />All ages are involved as players in this drama and that may ensure an audience of a wide age range. REVIEWER MCHAIKU predicts good fun for readers in the 4th-8th grade range, more discussion in classrooms & increased sales of Pentominoes ~ ~ & some of these are definitely works of ART !	2004-05-20

Jen Bryant writes in free verse about the year of the \\"Bruno Hauptmann Trial\\" ending in February 1935. When I read the story she has embroidered around this event my mind plays a newsreel of all the happenings of those three years following the kidnapping of Anne & Charles Lindbergh's baby son from their New Jersey home. Growing up in New York State the trauma of those times affected me deeply. 'Kidnap' was a scary word, a frightening thought. Men who found their way to our back steps asking to trade their labor for meals also seemed frightening. <br />How different from today was the media clamor then? The insatiable, dogged press? The celebrities coming to see and be seen? The pseudo souvenirs? The doubts? The inescapable and never-ending suffering of all involved? (The author tells us there are annual reinactments of The Trial even today). And more doubts? Hauptmann who went to the electric chair still claiming his innocence, is quoted as saying, \\"They think when I die, the case will die. They think it will be like a book I close. BUT THE BOOK, IT WILL NEVER CLOSE\\"<br />The author hopes the book will help readers \\"clarify their own concepts of truth and justice.\\" In the Author's Note, Bryant writes \\"The economic realities of the Great Depression, the rise of the mass media, the country's fear of war and need for emotional escape, all combined to make the Flemington (NJ) trial a true national spectacle.\\"<br />The graphics are appropriate and clever; the 'chapter headings' copy old Smith Corona type. 'Versified' stories happen to appeal to me; I hope they do not put off young people (especially boys) who could \\"osmose\\" some 1930s history as well as those concepts mentioned above.<br />Jen Bryant weaves stories into this sad history and has developed them against the backdrop of an ordinary town with characters that are likeable. Seventh-grader Katie Leigh Flynn, who acts as a pinch-hitting court stenographerfor her temporarily disabled journalist uncle, has troubled moments, real for her age. She grows through the experience and there is a perspective shared in this retelling that offers some healing.<br />REVIEWER MCHAIKU suggests that \\"THE TRIAL\\" is good reading, and another 'Young Adult' book ripe for adult consumption.	2004-05-18

They were striving toward the goal of Freedom while being slaves to the selfishness of others because of skin color. Dred and Harriet Scott are portrayed as real human beings, not objects to be moved as on a game board in a calculating manner, or according to whim.<br />The author describes their agony when 'slave poor' owners who had more slaves than could be used, either rented them out or sold them for needed cash. The Scotts were forced to send their daughters away for safety during the years, 1857 to 1867, when they lived through five trials.<br />Swain shares a unique insight into the famous \\"Dred Scott Decision\\" that burgeoned from this dream for freedom. Support given Dred and Harriet by white lawyers was amazing yet in the end it was a twist of fate, embodied in a conceited, selfish woman that brought them their freedom.<br />This book, \\"DRED AND HARRIET SCOTT: A FAMILY'S STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM\\" sheds light on the fragile nature of freedom, and the cruel irony that freedoms can be eroded by government edict.

Is this the story of Minnie OR is it the story of Willie Faye enchanting the Swift family? She is their distant relative who comes from Heart's Bend, Texas, to live with them in Indianapolis in the Fall of 1932. Willie Faye captivates the four sisters and brother Ozzie, who are growing up just as the Great Depression intrudes on their comfortable life.<br />Minnie calls it \\"The Time of The Dwindling\\" and her diary holds all her thoughts from the month before Christmas. There are colorful colloquialisms scattered throughout, and clever hands working on such projects as Christmas gift hats decorated with guinea hen feathers. The grinding economies forced on the family by the Depression and Papa's loss of work is evident mostly in dress make-overs, and in the menus concocted to stretch some meat, or no meat at all. A description of aspics made this reader laugh out loud, knowing how most of our family hold wobbly gelatines in distain. Young Ozzie's inventions include a \\"vomitron\\" which measures the revulsion some recipes provoke!<br />Imagination and creativity thrived in those years, and favorite radio shows were an important part of family life. Movie-going was a popular pastime, too, although in hard-hit families only the boys with jobs could afford tickets, even at ten cents, or a quarter for a double feature. But for true entertainment nothing could match the starry-eyed magic of Willie Faye's Christmas Eve story. Author Kathryn Lasky makes converts of her readers!<br />While the Swift family takes a stiff upper lip attitude about difficult times, their lives are changed by the arrival of the orphan cousin, and even more by the disappearance of their papa. It turns out that Ozzie inspired his father to write a radio serial, \\"Ozzie, the Boy Wonder.\\" It becomes so popular the family is catapulted right out of their personal Depression.<br />I wanted to reread Minnie's take on hard times after being charmed by the 2003 novel \\"CHIG and the Second Spread,\\" which tellsthe story of a family living only fifty miles south of Minnie Swift. In the hill country Minerva (Chig) Kalpin (could Minnie's name also be 'Minerva'?)grew up in poor, rather than 'comfortable' circumstances. Her experience was different yet similar: both families pulled together to overcome hard times with ingenuity and integrity. <br />Does the Depression Era seem part of the realm of fantasy today? For young readers it must hold the attraction of the unknown. Today's computer-age children will learn much from befriending Minnie and Willie Faye, AND Chig.	2004-01-02

Young readers will learn about the poverty of the lunch bucket that might hold one biscuit, spread only with ketchup -- instead of a real sandwich with TWO spreads.    This is a family story, warm with loving parents, Granny Shorty, brother Hubie, baby sister Em and a \\"Reverend Granddaddy.\\" In the hills of southern Indiana the teacher of the one-room school also plays a leading role; and there are entertainments like fierce games of marbles, and climbs up the town's glacial rock to make important decisions.    Life is a serious business. Ten-year-old Chig is encouraged by her teacher to 'go to the top' with her questions. Chig sends a letter to 'First Lady' Mrs. FDR, and the remaining chapters of the book hold some answers, a train disaster and YES! even a \\"growth spurt\\" for heroine Chig.    (Author Gwenyth Swain dedicated her book to the late Genevra \\"Chig\\" Owens, first woman commissioner of Brown County INDIANA, who is still remembered as an 'honest-to-goodness' politician who happened to be \\"petite.\\")	2003-11-11

Children will truly enjoy learning about this less-familiar carol, \\"ON CHRISTMAS DAY IN THE MORNING,\\" if they follow the suggestions about dressing up as animal farmers. From the amusing sparrow that \\"went out to harrow\\" to the crow who \\"went out to sow\\" kids will have a great time devising masks and costumes for a reinactment. They can go back to an age when farmers in England danced & sang to help their plants grow! Some of those farmers even wore animal masks with that hope. <br />Merry are Melissa Sweet's illustrations that show these imaginative preparations for the Nativity. The artist has embellished her paintings with symbols of Nature which help *plant* in our minds some thoughts of the miracle of rebirth.<br />Children always welcome the idea of Feasting, and will be eager to create a celebration similar to that shown in the joy-filled double-spread.

They have long been fictional favorites  so why drown them in an encyclopedia-length saga peopled with unappealing bit players? Their secrets, possibly rising from some dark celllar of the author's past, are played out in excruciating tedium.<br />Inevitably there will be inferior manuscripts published because the authors are &quot;established&quot; (aka &quot;income-producers&quot;), or they are celebrities. BUT that doesn't mean the books must be purchased -- or read.	2003-10-10

The Appalachian carol \\"I Wonder as I Wander\\" has a haunting melody - and words with staying power. *Perhaps* it came to the attention of American balladeer John Jacob Niles as described in this story. And the sweet, poignant words *may* tell about young Annie wrestling with the loss of her mother and the struggles of an itinerant life that followed.    The author's imagination paints word-pictures that artist Ron Himler shares in watercolor for our delight. Annie questioned God, honestly, with innocence and hope. Today when we hear that song we will feel the beauty of Christmas, while the hope lingers year 'round.    We have many wonderings of our own. Sharing these with our children is important, as is opening their eyes to the values 'grown' during the Depression years.     This is a book all ages will eagerly read together. WHY aren't special titles like this shelved in 'adult fiction' for more readers to discover?	2003-09-29

He is a 77 year-old who became a pinata maker when rheumatism made it too difficult to continue his business of making sombreros.<br />A village boy collects newspapers and concrete sacks for Tio Rico. These he uses to fashion unusual and decorative pinatas. The process is explained by a delightful profusion of photographs which accompany the story. The author, George Ancona, also shows \\"puppets\\"  which are child-size papier-mache forms worn by young folk dancers. He shows his own version of pinata formed over cardboard or balloons for those of us who cannot buy clay pots at a local market.<br />Children everywhere will enjoy this colorful book and be eager to try the craft. With luck, they will have patient teachers and learn some Spanish and/or English words, too! My favorite companion book is \\"Colors of Mexico\\" (isbn: #1575052164), illustrated by Janice Porter.<br />\\"THE PINATA MAKER\\" is a 5-star book for adults as well as children, and most appropriate for the 2003 church women's study of Mexico.

Many books telling the story of *Johnny Appleseed* are available for the enjoyment of children & adults. Most illustrators treat this subject as strictly legend. A few emphasize that John Chapman did in fact live and leave his mark on the future mid-west. Imagine how Grant Wood might have colored that landscape!    While I like to study the old engravings to help form my picture of this man, children may prefer the 'eccentric-woodsman-with-cookpot-on-head' image. Gwenyth Swain's story is colorfully illustrated by Janice Porter who portrays Chapman as being somewhat oriental. In the past I have liked many of her illustrations, but I feel this 5 star interpretation by the author is not enhanced by these pictures. Swain writes as close to the truth as possible. Sometimes the veil of myth is hard to push aside. Perhaps the illustrator is trying to do just that?    The book tells of Chapman's friendship with settlers and Indians; how he 'found' God and spread his beliefs while planting more and more trees. The author helps readers learn about the 'real' Johnny Appleseed, and appreciate the impact of his life's work even though some facts are missing. Yes, we want children to grow up with heroes; they should also be encouraged to look behind and beyond the myths.	2002-11-09

Can today's 4th and 5th graders identify with what may seem ancient history? Will Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her sausage curls draw young readers?<br />Let's hope Gwenyth Swain's story ignites interest & even passion<BR>in 'Women's Rights' and the tough fight to change conditions which today's girls can hardly believe ever existed: NO college for women! NO rights to personal or real property! and definitely NO VOTE!<br />Elizabeth was never a shy violet. She was bright and determined. The story of her childhood makes her seem genuinely real. Her beliefs were authentic and she never turned her back on them, or those who stood with her, persistent and dedicated.<br />As a fan of the author, I was delighted to see her picture on the back cover of the library edition. She is shown at the truly meaningful national historical monment to women's rights, an exciting museum complex in Seneca Falls -- in upstate New York.<BR>This is a town which many people identify as  the backdrop for the movie classic \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\". The museum draws people from all over the USA and world and gives one the opportunity to pay tribute to women who did battle for a worthy cause. I could bridge many decades and pose next to a hero, Frederick Douglass!<br />I recommend this 5-star book for its well-researched story, and useful bibliography. It will help growing readers as they learn to choose values for their own lives.	2002-11-07

It is many-faceted: rural life in the 30's,  the building of character from Quaker roots, post-WWII homesteading in southern Indiana, wise epigrams, tongue-in-cheek tales of wily Hoosiers, and the challenges &amp; delights of residing in a small community of artists, craftsmen and retired folk -- some 'native' -- some 'imported.' My favorite stories are 'Thanksgiving 1935,' 'Truck Policy' and 'The Scuprats of Salt Creek.'<br />Chapter headings are enhanced with handsome scratchboard drawings by another young-at-heart resident, Harlan Scheffler. The author's granddaughter, Tess Kean, designed the very attractive covers which bind the whole and picture the author philosophizing as he takes a break from raking his Brown County lawn.<br />There is a wryness in Swain's prose which is reminiscent of Robert Frost. The author's philosophy is close to that of Henry David Thoreau who is remembered for living in the woods. The book contains memoirs, 'entertainments' and even the poetry of 'Haying.' It is published by *1st Books Library* of Bloomington IN. The publisher also offers this title in electronic format.<br />Your SECOND COPY will rest handsomely &amp; provocatively on the bedside table of your guest room while you enjoy rereading parts from your own book.

Children's books are often the best reading -- and I might not find some titles were it not for Amazon's List Makers. \\"Home of the Brave\\" by Allen Say is such a discovery, a beautiful book.<br />Lucky is the author who can extend his message through his own poignant illustrations. This story of a man whose kayak is swept over a falls into an underground river is told as if in a dream. Is he climbing out of a kiva? Encountering two children, he walks with them in the desert toward lights which are those of an internment camp.<br />This surreal story tells about a people deserted by the country to whom they had given their allegiance. We remember the injustices during World War II and wonder what scars from today's prejudices and judgments are foretold. <br />How I would like to hear a group of young readers discuss what this story means to them. I hope parents and teachers do not try to escape facing these issues with children. To me there is a plea for understanding and Peace, and there is Hope. I  will read it again and again.	2002-07-09

BOOKWORKS: Making Books by Hand is published by Carolrhoda Books of Minneapolis, and so filled with projects that adults working with children may want to be selective in suggesting something simple like a collage & accordion book as a first step.<br />Whatever is chosen from the many varied examples is bound to be colorful and fun and give confidence which will lead to more complicated creations. Making the paper is a wonderfully squishy adventure which surprises and delights most beginners, even adults. Coloring or marbelizing paper is exciting,too. Sometimes words just tumble from one's imagination and soon the young artists have stories to write down, and perhaps decorate with block prints.<br />Gwenyth Swain introduces many interesting facts about the history of book-making, and you will feel the enthusiasm of the children pictured as they learn to make something \\"from scratch.\\" The Minnesota Center for Book Arts offers classes to hundreds of lucky students but your library or community arts group could sponsor similar workshops. Participants could experiment with  pop-ups for greeting cards, and make small bound books for special gifts. Their imaginations will suggest projects you can add in the back of the book.	2002-05-25

Attorney Don Robak is now Judge Robak fighting for the life of his wife Jo, poisoned to near-death by an unknown enemy. I frankly prefer not to have author Joe Hensley suggest that ugly terrorism is pervading Robak's beautiful, peaceful Ohio River community -- which I also love. I don't want to think about the presence of clannish rebels and menacing drug manufacturers there. There is, thankfully, some Hoosier? humor & classic rural characters to add balance. <BR>     Ugly or not, the many personalities are etched on my eyeballs; words have become indelible likenesses. With every page I want life restored to 'Jo'. I want a definitive squelch administered to the sexually overt 'Libby' and see her moneyed security shaken. I find I have developed an abhorrence for purchasing southern Indiana eggs!<BR>     The placid waterfront will always draw me, and I'll enjoy the author's \\"tree tag\\" of squirrels, and the stately mansions on quiet streets. BUT couldn't Joe Hensley's next book be about the ironies of life in peaceful, backward Brown County where the \\"Sheriff's Log\\" doesn't raise goosebumps?<BR>     Listen, you readers: this is a favorite author of mine you should not miss! After you buy this and chew on its contents awhile, write to the author and suggest that, for a change, he write a story about life in the truly slow lane. Admittedly, it is my squeamishness that prevents me from giving 5 stars.	2002-05-21

The author Whiteson describes it as a &quot;sleepy urban village edged with onion fields and swamplands.&quot; There Rodia built his dream: towers which reached 99.5 feet high at the peak, with spires, gazebos and fountains, embellished with green Seven Up and blue Milk of Magnesia bottles, and endless bits of crockery -- all with no financial assistance from anyone.<br />     Until 1987 he worked with steel rods &amp; concrete, giving this gift of identity to the community. In 1954 Rodia deeded the property to a neighbor and left, never to return.  From the helpful TIME LINE we learn that the city engineers conducted structural tests in 1959 and the towers were allowed to stand. The Watts riots followed in August of 1965; in 1975 the long-neglected masterpiece was donated to the city. In 1985 a Conservation Conference was held to draw up an extensive repair program which is still being implemented. The story is fascinating; the reality even more so.	2002-03-20
