There is no pulse to the spinal fluid that is not directly caused by the cardiovascular system, and skull bones are fused early in life, thus making any perceived shifting of them illusory.  It's just another placebo ritual masquerading as science.  The surest sign of that is the complete lack of hard scientific evidence (ie controlled double-blind studies) supporting it, and instead a reliance on testimonials such as those written here.<br />The author actually thinks that individual cells in the body have an individual consciousness and can verbalize their &quot;thoughts&quot;!  It would be funny were it not so sad, and were people with legitimate medical needs not wasting valuable time, energy and money on such nonsense.	2001-06-11

Then this is the book for you.  Here, finally, you get a detailed, intelligent and practical book on how to take your great strategies and actually make them work for you.  They take you through detailed examples of where and how their &quot;scorecard&quot; system was put into practice, where it succeeded, and even where it failed.  That last bit alone puts this book leagues ahead of the cheerleading that usually pervades business books.  There's none of that here - these guys are honest enough to be critical of their own view, which while crucial to practically all scientific achievement, is usually lacking in such books. And even the writing, again as opposed to many business books, is also first rate.  It's all masterfully well-thought out and edited.  It's a must for anyone interested in business strategy and implementation.	2000-12-20

To that extent it might be considered a bit overpriced.  But that aside, the theme of making a lot out of smaller space couldn't be presented better.  The illustrations are fabulous and helpful, and while some of the houses appear to have been built with more than a modest budget, the ideas can easily be converted to a smaller monetary scale.

Concepts such as individualism are explored in a very readable manner.  Had history been this interesting in high school I'd not have had so many naps in class. It's very intellectually exciting to see him trace the path we took to get to our present day &quot;decadence&quot;, which he sees as the &quot;consumer culture&quot;. While the information may not be unique, it is still a great read, especially since it deals with the issues in a fairly even handed manner and does not sound like a partisan screed. When Barzun speaks of liberalism, he speaks in the classic sense, not the modern one, as he bounces from thinker to thinker on this 500 year thought tour.

This generation has gone too long underappreciated as useless old farts by the Boomers, Xers and the latest generation.  We forget that they built modern America thorugh their sacrifices and just plain old determination. While one might quibble with Brokaw's claim of this generation being the greatest (how about the revolutionary war and civil war gens), they are unquestionably the greatest alive today. Brokaw chronicles in easy-to-read vivid vignettes the lives of an assortment of WWII vets from all walks of life. While one might yearn for a bit more detail on the transition from wartime sacrifice to peacetime production, its still a must read for putting the accomplishments of this great generation into perspective.	2000-12-13

Once you read this you'll understand why we owe those soldiers so much thanks and why they'd rather not hear about those times. And what is amazing is that Roney delivers this historical feast in his usual direct and caustic style we've gotten used to on TV.  You'll laugh and cry throughout.	2000-12-13

This is no exception.  While the critiques of religion may trouble some, they are presented in such a compelling manner that their literary value shouldn't be overlooked. The characters are given tremendous depth, as we learn how they think and act.  We are also introduced to some exciting new characters as those covered in previous books take a back seat.

The amazing thing about the book is that the basic storyline remains solid despite the shifting camera angles, and when the climax finally comes, the complete picture becomes clear and is completely amazing. It's a great combination of a good pop-novel story to keep you turning the pages, and artistic merit with regard to originality of story and development of character. This is probably her best work, combining erotic family issues, sci-fi and social issues.  Placing a novel within the novel would seem like pretentious showing off were it not done so well.

He takes complicated business concepts and ties them up into neat little packages, and he riles the little guys working for the &quot;big corporations&quot; who just don't get it.  But the problem is that he goes from good straightforward descriptions of current business components to Y2K-type positive hysteria touting the now-debunked myth of the dot-coms taking over the market place from the plodding corporations. In that respect, the ultimate irony is that because of the speed with which his touted dot-com marketplace moves, the book may have set a modern record for obsolesence. That said, there are some good solid insights about life in the new dot-com marketplace.  You just have to be able to toss aside the mounds of foamy exagerration to get to the kernals of wisdom and truth Hamel offers. And at least the book itself is nice, large, and attractive - once you've gleaned the few points of wisdom, it will look great on your coffee table.	2000-12-12

What then may appear to be a negative as far as simplistic dialogue and small size becomes an asset in the rereading necessary to change ones habits to incorporate the wisdom of these few pages.

It's tough to appreciate in one's head what it is like to cut a tunnel without knowing the steepness of the mountain.   He repeats himself incredibly frequently, which wears on the reader after 100 or so pages.  The story is no doubt historically significant, and having some prior knowledge of the subject, I was fascinated at this look at one of the biggest projects to combine free market forces with government funds.  But to a reader new to the subject, the poor presentation is liable to leave too many important questions unanswered, and too many headaches rom the repetitions.	2000-12-04

For example, all the information is put in one place, so none of that maddening flipping back and forth to compare maps to birds and flight patterns, etc.   The amount of detail is quite impressive!  Now you'll have all the information necessary to identify even the most difficult species.  Even the names are completely up to date. A great gift for the birdwatcher in your world.	2000-11-30

I'm not sure I'd follow all the advise, even if I did find myself in one of these crazy scenarios.  But the book is the ultimate coffee table, waiting room time killer.  True or not, it's a very entertaining read.  More cotton candy than steak in the brain food department. It's a way for all of us who have wondered what we'd do &quot;if&quot; to actually think through the scenarios in more detail, and the authors provide plenty of that. But the bottom line the book makes clear in just about any situation is that survival or just plain old success requires making the best use of your resources and never giving up, and that applies to all of life, not just crocodile wrestling.  So the book has a more universal appeal than many of the negative critics give it credit for.	2000-11-29

It appeals to both adults and children as do all of the latter Potter books (3rd and on).  Harry's character is also greatly developed as we learn more about his past, but it doesn't get in the way of the fast-moving action that will have you seeing just how fast you can turn the pages!   It's a soon-to-be classic of good vs evil.	2000-11-28

While it may be unerving to learn that the most powerful man in American politics is not elected, for those frustrated by economic fedspeak, this book lays out the way the Fed works in a way the interested layman can understand.

The lesson is that man and nature must learn to coexist, told only how a biologist writer could do.  For those who have been lost in the world of concrete and skyscrapers, this will remind you of the wonders of the natural world.

This is what makes his show so thought provoking and interesting even when you disagree with him.  The life stories included in the book are also interesting, and on a wide range of topics, not just politics.  <br />And while his opinions are all over the place, even sometimes (gasp) liberal, he usually backs them up with evidence.  A fine effort from the toughest interviewer out there.	2000-11-25

Parents might want to preview it as the ending may be a bit much for some children.  The character development is amazing, and it will leave you wanting more while being satisfied at the same time.  There are even some surprises.  Get past the hype and evaluate the book on its own merits and its greatness cannot be denied.  You'll never want to put it down.

The characters are totally believable, and as such we see a part of ourselves in them, making the book a wonderful tool for selfreflection. Especially representative of this is his masterful use of the gory details of everyday bodily functions, which at first glance might seem voyeuristic, but is necessary to bring the characters and their tragic flaws alive.  And once the readers empathy is triggered in this way, he is too connected to do anything but keep reading to see what happens. And what happens is so gut wrenching as to make the effort to get there seem trivial by comparison.  My surprise of the year.	2000-11-22

And the fabulous message will seep in to the delight and enrichment of everyone who experiences it.  The Grinch is so evil and scary intitailly that children everywhere will recoil from the image, as they should.  The transformation that this character experences when he steals all the materialistic trappings of Christmas in Whoville only to find that it had no effect at all is nothing short of stupendous.  This will prompt life-relevant questions from 3 year olds and teens alike.  And to top it off, Dr. Suess stays as religiously neutral as possible, so as to allow people of all faiths, or lack thereof, to apply whatever values they see fit to the REAL reason for Christmas.	2000-11-22

US	51245258	R31OZ8OA4YI0UK	0879758236	784675167	Does God Exist?: The Debate between Theists & Atheists	Books	3	11	15	N	N	The non-debate debate	This book has the best of intentions, but leaves one feeling a bit flat.  The first big issue I have is with the introduction, done by Peter Kreeft, and poorly, for he gives a description of the problem from the CHRISTIAN perspective only.  Oh, he talks about atheism, but only as a believer sees it.  For example, he lists Pascal's wager as an argument for the existence of God.  Now a die-hard Christian might see it that way, but educated atheists and Christians alike can see that Pascal's wager is an argument to BELIEVE in God, not an argument for the EXISTENCE of God.<br />The bigger problem is that the primary debators, Moreland and Neilson, debate two entirely different issues, so end up with dueling monologues.  Many think that Moreland won the debate.  I disagree, because Moreland has the tougher task, having to prove both Nielson wrong (who argued that the term &quot;god&quot; is meaningless) and himself right.  That is, proving the term &quot;god&quot; to have meaning doesn't prove that such a being exists.  Neilson would be the victor by winning either one.  So the deck was stacked against Moreland, and in a draw of that sort, I'd give the nod to the negative.<br />The saving grace of the book is in the contributors who, with the possible exceptionr Craig, all offer wonderful insights on the issue, leaving Moreland and Neilson looking worn out and irrelevant by comparison.  One could be forgiven for wondering why, say, Keith Parsons and Dallas Willard (two of the best contributors) were not selected for the debate.  Willard even comments on the intellectual disconnect between the primaries.<br />So its a decent book, but it could have been so much better.	2000-11-13

Peck's first two sections have good sound advice about a healthy world view, testing one's theorie's, seperating the theory from reality, etc.  The main criticism of these sections is that they are highly repetitive and could be WAY shorter.  I can summarize the section entitled &quot;Falling in love&quot; in one sentence - puppy love is not true love.  Everyone together - DUH!<br />But we get a forshadowing of the nonsense to come in the summary of part I entitled &quot;Renunciation and Rebirth&quot;.  Here Peck commits the fallacy of authority over and over again as he demands the reader accept the absurd notion that birth and death are similar merely because he has dug up a lot of quotes from people that agree with him.  Then in &quot;The Work of Attention&quot; he hits us with some baseless newage &quot;It is entirely possible that he could sense within his audience the intensity of my concentration, my attention, my love and he may have been thereby rewarded.&quot;<br />It's all downhill from there, as Peck violates every soundmaxim he established in the first two sections.  Never was an author so schizophrenic.  He procedes to illustrate every fallacy and means of poor reasoning imaginable.  In &quot;Religion and Science&quot; he laughably tries to claim that religion and science are akin merely because both rely on assumptions.  The distinction between well-reasoned self-evident assumptions and those arbitrarily given from on high apparently eludes him.  In &quot;Scientific Tunnel Vision&quot; he completely misunderstands the difference between rejecting a claim which CANNOT be measured and a claim which is DIFFICULT to measure, and he also fails to explain how one is to determine truth or falsehood without measurements.<br />Finally, his final section, Grace, repeats the same two mistakes ad nauseum:<br />1) the presumption that his answer should be treated as plausible  if no one knows for sure what it is.  This ignores the fact that  one can know what an answer is NOT without knowing what it is.  Thus he claims that either there is a loving god or nothing, ignoring all other possibilities<br />2) His complete lack of understanding of probabilities, and how given enough people engaging in enough activities and looking for &quot;coincidences&quot;, many will be noticed COMPLETELY by chance.  To Peck, ANYTHING that occurs positively by chance is proof of the existence of his warped view of God.<br />It's just another example of a true-believer pounding his fist that we believe as he does, while giving us scant reason to do so  that any well-informed rational person would respond to.mption that his answer should be treated as plausible  if no one knows for sure what it is.

US	51245258	R23XJTCR44GW2P	0684823780	338167986	Mere Christianity	Books	2	17	50	N	N	Impressive only to the Ill-informed	When I read MC in college, I remember being impressed with it, and felt for the first time my agnosticism being challenged.  Imagine my surprise years later when I picked it up and found it sorely lacking.  Trained eyes revealed that Lewis simply does not logically connect his conclusions to his premises.  Oh, he makes gestures to that effect, but form alone does not a logical argument make.  He avoids obvious objections to his arguments usually involving a POV beyond the immediate moment, so his arguments seem forced towards a predetermined end.<br />To illustrate, consider this exchange from the section entitled &quot;The Reality of the Law&quot;:<br />&quot;If we ask 'why ought I to be unselfish?', and you reply 'because it is good for society', we may then ask 'why should I care what is good for society except when it happens to pay ME personally?', and then you will have to say 'Because you ought to be unselfish - which simply brings us back to where we started.'<br />But I am not forced to such a self-serving answer because the obvious response is that I care what is good for society because that tends to result in lots of things that pay me personally in the future, irrespective of whether it happens to pay me at the moment.  Lewis' only response to this is to say that &quot;as an explanation of why we feel as we do about right ad wrong it just misses the point&quot;.  This is typical of what one finds in the book - any counterexample to Lewis' theory is either ignored entirely, or dismissed out of hand as off point.<br />I give Lewis credit for his effort, and to the ill-informed it might pose a challenge.  But to the well-read and logically versed, it falls very flat, revealed as one long unsupported assertion.  One can be forgiven for writing in almost every margin &quot;How does Lewis know that?&quot;.  Just don't expect any answers.	2000-11-11
US	51245258	RFI7YERZZ0SBZ	0451163087	465394256	For the New Intellectual: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand (50th Anniversary Edition) (Signet)	Books	3	44	54	N	N	A Bit of Objectivity in the Midst of all this Biased Vitriol	Given the absurdly slanted reviews I've seen here, I thought I'd try to give a bit more of an, er, objective account.  And since the book is sort of a sampler of all Rand's work, a bit of broad background is in order.<br />What Ayn Rand's critics say about her personally is mostly on the mark.  She was a hypocritical megalomaniac, tolerated independent thought only insofar as it agreed with her, was far too quick to levy personal attacks rather than substantive rebuttals to opponent's arguments, and often engaged in scholarship that was less than, um, scholarly, for the sake of expediency.<br />Unfortunately none of this excuses Rand's critics for making the same mistake with regard to her.  Too often her arguments are ignored in lieu of her personal peccadilloes, and while Rand's claim to perfection (more or less) might excuse a bit more enthusiasm in pointing out her errors, it doesn't excuse writing her off entirely.  This is classic ad hominem argumentation, the sort of thing that would have us write off &quot;In Principia&quot; because Newton wasted forests of paper writing about alchemy and believed in biblical inerrancy.<br />As a result, much of what Rand's critics say about her philosophy, and those who view it with some value, is NOT on the mark.  While it is true that some of Rand's followers act as if every body expulsion of hers carries philosophical significance, the vast majority of people simply see some value in Rand's writings while recognizing that she makes mistakes like everyone else.  Her writings on sex are best used for kindling, but her unique and insightful views on the symbolism in the Garden of Eden myth, and the purpose and value of money (all included in FTNI), alone make her a benefactor to the history of human thought.<br />The claim that Rand mostly appeals to high school students is so baseless and preposterous it is difficult to take seriously.   One would be hard pressed to find one high school student in a thousand that even knows who Rand is, much less having read and understood what she had to say.  No, Rand appeals mostly to people who are fed up with the gooey postmodern movement in society that has us being asked to promote feelings over facts (see any liberal response to anti-gun control arguments), and pretending that changing the name of a condition changes the condition (see any PC verbiage).<br />The problem with most of the criticism that actually bothers to deal with Rand's arguments is that her arguments are often misunderstood, and this is partially Rand's fault.  She used language very precisely and somewhat idiosyncratically, at least when viewed from the knee-jerk view of the layman.  From my POV she used words as they should be used, and that such semantic battles are crucial to promoting a change in the way people think.  But when one uses words in a minority way, one must expect to be misunderstood unless one is willing to put forth considerable effort to contextualize what one says, and Rand too often failed to do this.  Thus when she said something like &quot;man cannot exist sans rationality&quot;, a previous reviewer can be forgiven for thinking that she meant no person can remain alive via faith, and therefore she has been refuted.  However this isn't at all what she meant.  What she was getting at is that rationality is the tool via which mankind acquires what it needs to function as human beings should, a far more complex proposition, and one that requires much background to understand.  But without that background, one could easily erroneously, but understandably, conclude that Rand's writings are &quot;pseudointellectual&quot;.<br />The bottom line is that Rand promotes some highly intriguing ideas backed by quite a bit of thought.  Where else will one see the producer placed on a higher rung than the giver?  Who can totally blow off the motivation of socialism in those who simply want to gain at the loss of those they consider &quot;rich&quot;?  Anyone who reads this or any Rand writing for the first time and claims to be unmoved intellectually is kidding himself.  A prime example would be those who are religious and see no similarity between them, and their leaders, to Rand's &quot;witch doctor&quot; persona.  They simply haven't forced themselves to think past the pious-babble that accompanies most religious thought, for it rarely takes me more than 5 minutes of questioning a believer to get them to practically quote Rand's &quot;witch doctor&quot; persona.  It's tough to read about Attila and the Witch Doctor and NOT think of the Roman empire and the history of the papacy.<br />Which brings me to Rand's historical errors.  Most of those I've seen fall into the true-but-irrelevant category a la Bluto's famous &quot;Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor&quot; quote in animal house - her fact was a bit off, but the point made still holds.  Some Gore fans might be able to relate to this. Just because the fact you present as evidence for your view is false doesn't make your view false.  It only makes it unsupported, but too often Rand's critics stop there and dismiss her.<br />So, all in all, 3 stars.  It is after all, only a sampler, but it is guaranteed to get you to think about issues in a way you never have.  For the real meat, read Atlas Shrugged, which along with 1984 and Brave New World, will pretty much give you a complete understanding of everything that goes on in modern society and politics.	2000-11-09
