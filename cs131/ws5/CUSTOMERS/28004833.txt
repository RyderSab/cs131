Wow, was I ever impressed. I used to be into comic books and art in general while in high school, but never in my wildest dreams would I have envisioned what the medium would become. Yes, I am getting old and no, I haven't been keeping up with comics. So, there may be better out there but not with so many different styles: One in pastel, one comp. generated, another in oils, and even a more traditional pen and ink section (all executed exquisitely). <br /> <br />If you are interested in finding out what can be accomplished stylistically and artistically in the world of graphic novels look no further. I can't wait to find volume two. <br />	2005-05-04

But Levy had me hooked by the first chapter. I could not help but care about the characters he portrayed and their plight against the American government. A hectic pace drags you through the book, knowing that their discovery has to be in time to save all of our privacy. If you can't find yourself caring about that then this is not the book for you. <br /> <br />The highest course I've ever taken is pre-calc and I never use higher math in my daily life. So, I have to attribute my fanaticism to this book on Levy's writing and the power of the story itself. Also, the ideas are so well articulated that even a moron like me can pick up on most of the theory (albeit in a simplistic form).  <br /> <br />I would recommend this to any one who has ever fought the establishment or anyone that has ever wanted to. <br />	2005-04-16

If Paul Di Filippo is doing it, then YES it is. <br /> <br />All I can say is Wow! This book does a very good job of speculating the exact nature of the universe. In any other authors hands this book would have turned into a scientific/sci-fi disaster. But Paul pulls it off and with such ease that you might not notice  you are actually learning while reading. It is chocked-full of great existing theories and puts them into words that even I can understand.  <br /> <br />It is the story of Paul Girard and how he is granted the ability to travel between every conceivable dimension. What does he do? Well, for starters he seriously F's up. I may like the character because he reminds me so much of myself. <br /> <br />I would recommend this to anyone who has ever wondered \\"why are we here?\\" It does help if you have a little bit of scientific knowledge, but the book is so good that you could get by without it.  <br /> <br />Why have I not heard of this guy sooner? <br />	2005-04-13

This novel jumps from present day Sarajevo in 1993 to, in the next chapter, Long Island in the 1980's. In Sarajevo Falk fights to stay alive and find stories as an inexperienced and naive freelance reporter, back on Long Island he fights a long and horrible depression that started for no reason and for twelve long hard years showed no signs of ever ending. John is convinced that no one can help him and all he can do is try to hang on and hope everything goes back to the way it was.  <br /> <br />Through the book we see all aspects of his life and get to know Falk better than most of our closest relatives. It made me wonder how many of my close friends are secretly battling depression. John eventually does see a psychiatrist, and after a few different medications finally finds relief. After college he sets off to find himself and ends up in Sarajevo alone again. But with the help of Zoloft he knows that nothing is hopeless. <br /> <br />As a depression survivor, I would recommend this to anyone that thinks that they are alone without hope or anyone that has ever been comforted, as Falk was at one point, by knowing that they can end their life anytime. I know I've made the book sound depressing but Falk is a wonderful writer and the novel has many funny and uplifting moments. The world would be a better place if more people were like John Falk. <br />	2005-04-01

In outward appearance, this book is about one man reading every word in the Encyclopedia Britannica.     On the inside, between interesting facts and strange coincidences (many cross-eyed references), it is the story of A.J.s journey to discover who he is. He revisits his child hood through memories and later in the book actually goes, for a day, to his high school and takes classes with the students. A.J. also is trying to find out \\"why\\" he acts the way he does. As a child, why did he envision himself as the smartest kid in the world? Why has he always been in competition with his father? His dad has been nothing but supportive through his whole life and yet A.J. always feels upstaged. The sad thing is that even A.J. does not like this side of his personality.     During his entries (he goes from A to Z listing some of the more interesting and bizarre entries) you will also learn that A.J. and his wife are trying to get pregnant and it is interesting to witness first hand what that journey can do to a mans psyche.     I know I've made The Know-it-All sound as if it's some very deep reading (and it is if you chose to read it as such), but the truth is that A.J.s witty writing style is very funny and easy to read. I would recommend this to any one who loves to laugh and is interested in all sorts of strange information.	2005-03-29

In Vonnegut's writing and even more so with Heller's, while funny, you cannot help but know that the humor is hiding a pain so great that it threatens to crush the narrator and you, if you're not weary. Connelly, while having a different writing style, has the same dark humor that fans of the above authors may respect. One good example is a scene in which Frank and his paramedic coworkers get drunk and create their own emergency site in the bar, complete with sheet covered pseudo-corps and one giving the dead last writes while splashing the dead with holy water, aka liquor. I haven't done it justice but you'll just have to trust me when I say it is a funny scene indeed.    Now, if you're the bipolar or easily depressed type you may not want to read this book. While it does give great insight into the lives of those who work to rescue us every day, the narrator (Frank) leads a downtrodden life that would make any would-be paramedic rethink his/her career choice. Every street is home to multiple nightmarish job calls and Frank starts to lose his grip on what is memory and what is actually happening in the moment. Ghosts seem to stalk him wherever he goes, managing to ruin almost every aspect of his life.    I would recommend this to anyone who loves a great and emotional story with lots of wry, black humor mixed in. However, be warned that this is not for the easily broken hearted. If you do decide to read BOtD I would recommend that you pay close attention to characters mentioned only in passing at the outset of the book, as many become key characters towards the end.	2005-03-29

But, if you see the world with the eyes of a wondering youth, no matter what your age, then you will be completely enchanted by \\"Gorgon\\" by the time you finish the preface. The writing will make you wish that you were as even half as passionate as Peter Ward- about anything; if I had read this as a child my career and study choices may have been much different. Adolescents beware, you may find yourself wanting to dig in the dirt in the middle of nowhere for the rest of your life.

I've noticed that a lot of reviewers have been giving Morgan a hard time about having ideas similar to those of William Gibson. I hate to tell you guys that \\"cyber punk\\" was started long before Neuromancer. Morgan is even being compared to himself-\\"not as good as Altered Carbon\\" is a common quote. Well, come on people, Altered Carbon is, in my opinion, a classic. Not much stacks up against that.  <br /> <br />With that said, this is a superbly written book. Many have gone into the plot so I'll leave that to them. Kovacs yet again struggles against his training to empathize with other humans, which is what this book is mainly about. The \\"Martian ship\\" that is supposed to be the focus of the story does not even come into play until about two-thirds of the way through.  <br /> <br />If you are sensitive to violence and sexual situations, you may want to consider reading some other author. Nevertheless, do not misconstrue the violence and sexuality as senseless. Both are an integral part of the story.  <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this to anyone that loves to get the adrenalin pumping. Also, no one seems to be noticing that the mystery aspect is quite good as well. Motives are undisclosed until the very end. <br />	2005-03-11

If you think that the carnage described with in it is some type of ridiculous distortion (as some reviewers seem to think) of real life in war, then you may need to read up on your military non-fiction. Try Dispatches, by Herr or for something closer to our current era check out Black Hawk Down, by Bowden. These are not Sci-Fi but display a lack of humanity in war that rivals anything in Broken Angels.  <br /> <br />Do not make the mistake of thinking Broken Angels is glamorizing war. It merely shows it for what it is and always will be- young and old, men and women, solders and civilians dying for no other reason than the whims of the ruling class, for profit and power.  <br /> <br />Finally, for any reviewer opining on how Morgans writing is so violent and sexual; let me remind you that shows like 24 and Desperate Housewives are not about math and baking cookies. Whether you realize it or not, sex and violence are just as popular in the Blue states as in the Red. What I'm getting at is, at least in Broken Angels the writing is somewhat erudite with some form of intelligent dialogue on the nature of war, and the violence illustrated in the book makes you sick and angry (as it should). The stuff on television has no such qualms. Its only purpose is to get you to tune in next week. <br />	2005-03-11

I have read about half of C.M.'s books and I finally realized why I did not like some of the others more. I have been reading them in the wrong order. You see, although it doesn't really matter what order you read them in, if you read them in order you will have an opportunity to meet allot of the same characters at different times in their lives. For example, about fifty pages into Practical DemonKeeping it hit me that Catch, the main antagonist of the book, was also in Lamb, a book that I had read almost a year ago. If I had read the books in order it would have made Lamb that much more interesting. In addition, his last book The Stupidest Angel is like a coming home party for many of his characters. <br /> <br />Here's the order: 1.Practical Demonkeeping (1992) 2.Coyote Blue (1994) 3.Blood sucking Fiends (1995) 4.Island of the Sequined Love Nun (1997) 5.Lamb (2002) 6.Fluke (2003) 7.The stupidest angel (2004) his last book as of this review. <br /> <br />Fans of Tom Robbins or Kurt Vonnegut may like these, but don't get me wrong, the writing is not similar. However, the interesting ideas (of Tom Robbins) and the black humor (Vonnegut) may captivate you. <br />	2005-02-14

John Welter calls up fond memories of Joseph Heller's' Catch-22 with his main characters irreverent logic and uncompromising honesty. This and Catch-22 are two of the only books I've red that made me laugh out loud at least once a page. The big difference is that N.of the A.B.F. is so depressingly sad that at times I was scared to keep reading. <br /> <br /> The main character, Doyle Coldiron, is in the Secret Service, along with his wacky co-workers, his job is to protect important and respected people, people whom he believes \\"don't deserve to be important, much less respected\\". Doyle spends most of his days fervently contemplating his lonely existence and dreaming of the one woman he loves, even though she is married and he knows that it can never be. Coldiron is a truly likable character and I felt his heartache; what could be better proof of a good book? <br /> <br /> Some may say that Welter repeats his ideas (contemplations on loneliness and hurt) too often. However, I believe that he is only trying to impress upon the reader Doyle's' profound loneliness. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this to any one who liked Yossarian or anyone who likes to laugh. If you're like me, you'll be rooting for Doyle the whole way. <br />	2005-02-14

Heinlein no matter where his soul rests. He gave us a beautiful story of love and the human spirit, and shows that we as people could be happy if we only chose to. Many reviewers have gone in-depth about the plot, so I will not repeat it for you here. <br /> <br />Secondly, in first impression his (R.A.H.) style reminds me most of Ray Bradbury; not in small part because of the fact that they both started in the \\"Golden Age\\" of Sci-Fi. Stranger in a Strange Land was written in the fifties and is infused with the colloquialisms of that particular era. If you have seen the movie Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow then you'll know the type of language that I'm speaking of. Though, this novel is not as \\"Golly-Gee-Wiz\\"ish as that movie. <br /> <br />Finally, for Christians, Non-Christians and people of no faith at all, this is a beautiful story that somewhat follows that of the life of Christ. It will remind readers who know of Christ's' teachings what his most important message is: Above all else love each other; love each other no matter what. <br /> <br />I would recommend this to any Bradbury fan, or any one else who wants to see what one of the best Sci-Fi authors has to offer. <br />	2005-02-12

Lou doesn't always understand why his boss wants him to do certain things but Lou likes to look for patterns and is happy to do it.     The plot is great; in the near future a possible cure for autism is found and Lou's boss wants him and the others to be part of the test group.

Many reviewers tell of the plethora of new and interesting ideas in this novel, which was ground breaking for 1951. Yes, the ideas are still fresh but, as has been pointed out, there are many holes in the ideas concerning Espers (a new evolution of mindreading humans). Put that aside and you have a great early sci-fi novel that rivals that of Asimov or any other of their contemporaries and a pretty good mystery to boot.    A part of the book that impressed me was that the climax was strung out for such a long duration. For the last one-hundred pages I kept thinking that there could not possibly be more, but Bester surprised me again and again.

Along with Enders Game by Orson Scott Card, this has the crappiest story to cover ratio ever(this is a horrible cover that has nothing at all to do with the book). I have a terrible habit of letting the cover of a book influence me. Thankfully my better judgment prevailed. I read this book in two days and had to drag myself away from it the first night (at 2am, I had to get up at 6am).     The chapters are set up so that one takes place in the present and two is a sort of flash back and so on. This makes it compulsively hard to put down. To me that is one of the most important qualities in a book and this one does it perfectly.    In the future an asteroid is discovered containing hundreds of automated space ships that are capable of faster than the speed of light travel (the problem is that you don't really know where the ship is going, if anywhere). The beings who built the ships are long gone and have left no trace as to what happened to them or where they went to. So humans take it upon themselves to inhabit the asteroid and send \\"Prospectors\\" out in the ships to search the stars.  A lot of them don't come back.    The book is essentially an interview between one of the most famous and wealthy (prospectors get a percentage of the profits on any thing they find) Prospectors, Robinette, and his computerized therapist. As you get deeper into the book the tension mounts and spirals towards an incident too painful for Robinette to speak of, terminating in one of the most satisfying endings of any book I've ever read.	2004-12-29

Snow Crash (another more famous \\"cyberpunk\\" novel) is like a kids cartoon compared to this gritty, sexual and violent novel. R. M. sets the world, the year 25K, alive. Don't look for pandering descriptions of the world of tomorrow though. The future unravels slowly with only the bits necessary for the story shown. The plot on the other hand doesn't unravel as much as bowl you over. This is one of the only books I've read, other than ghost stories, which have the main character die within the first three pages. The gunfight on the first pages sets the pace for the rest of the book and Morgan's descriptions are amazing. <br /> <br />This is not for anyone who is easily offended by violence or sexual situations. But don't let that hinder your enjoyment of the novel, the V and S fit perfectly into the world Morgan has crafted. Look at our tendencies as a society now and you may see our future printed in this book. <br /> <br />If you do decide to read Altered Carbon it would be my advice to remember all of the names referenced early on. My memory is bad to say the least and I wish someone had warned me to pay closer attention. <br /> <br />I would recommend this to anyone who loves great sci-fi with a believable cohesive future and tons of action (oh yeah, the mystery is pretty slick to). <br /> <br />PS. Don't get me wrong, I loved Snow Crash too.	2004-12-09
US	28004833	RIJEXI2QGM95J	0553380958	445913	Snow Crash	Books	5	0	2	N	N	My first Neal Stephenson read.	At the outset we meet our protagonist, Hiro Protagonist (yes, it is a stupid name). It is difficult to tell exactly what is taking place. The narrator speaks in third person who is quite annoying at first but you get used to it; does not last through the whole book. Soon it becomes clear that Hiro is a pizza delivery boy who also thinks he is a samurai. <br /> <br />Please don't stop reading after the first fifty or sixty pages as I almost did. I promise that it starts to make sense. The whole book is not about the process of future pizza delivery. If you stop you will miss out on some of the best speculative fiction ever. Hiro must figure out who is unleashing a virus that can destroy minds through the Metaverse (the future internet). Rarely had a book raised my adrenalin levels as much as this did. <br /> <br />I must admire an author who can take such a silly seeming idea and infuse it with so mush life and thankfully Stephenson is writing faster than most people can read. From the reviews it seems that this is something to be thankful for.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended to any Sci-fi fan not only hackers and programmers (I can barely check my email). <br />	2004-11-20

As others have stated, the book leaves you wondering if maybe you missed something while reading it the first time. Thankfully the characters (especially Frannie) are so well drawn and the writing so good that you may not mind reading it again. Unfortunately I have too many books waiting for me on my counter to justify a reread (at least not at this moment). It is quite possible that I did miss something. <br /> <br />With that said, Wooden Sea reminded me of amore sentimental HARUKI MURAKAMI (I have herd of them both categorized as \\"magical realists\\")It is the story of how a three legged one eyed dog, a feather, a shovel, a lizard, a couple of other Frannies from different times, and aliens can turn a normal guys life into a hectic mess. Any possibility that they could not have. . . Well, maybe the feather but the rest is definitely messed up. <br /> <br />The plot was sort of goofy at times (the reason it did not get five stars) but the power of the writing pulls you through to the end. I would recommend this to anyone who can suspend their beliefs of what is real. <br />	2004-11-11

In the near future biological advances allow parents to choose certain biological traits for their impending children, one of which is sleeplessness. At the outset, this \\"child upgrade\\" is highly sought after. Parents soon realize that the amount of work involved in raising a child who never sleeps is astronomical; it also takes a high psychological and physical toll on both parties. <br /> <br />Once grown, the first group of sleepless is seen as a boon to society. Their advancements in science and economics are hailed as miracles. As more and more sleepless grow the \\"sleepers\\" start to realize that they are going to have to compete with a group that many see as having an unfair advantage. A schism starts to form in society between the sleepers and the sleepless. <br /> <br />The novel follows mainly the Camden sisters- twins, Liesha and Alice. Liesha is a genetically altered sleepless who's birth was planned. However, another egg is fertilized accidentally during the pregnancy. Alice is the product of that accident; she is a completely unaltered sleeper. Envy and animosity abound on both sides. <br /> <br />Nancy Kress has a real gift for characterization. One of the best parts on this novel is the incredible people and their realistic interaction.  <br /> <br />It took me two weeks to read the first 80 pages and only three day to read the last 320. It takes awhile to warm-up but it is worthwhile. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves great writing, not only sci-fi. <br />	2004-10-28

I don't care whether your a garbage man or a CEO (or a really messy CEO who happens to constantly be picking up trash) one of the most difficult problems in life is finding the place were you can feel you belong. Pratchet, in the few of his books I've read (mostly the Night Watch part of Disk world with Carrot and Vimes), has a great knack for illustrating this problem and showing how his characters find ways to overcome it.    In Mort Death is tired of his endless job, ushering the souls of the living into the after life. Not a bad job, it just gets to be boring doing the same thing since the dawn of time. He locates what seems to be a suitable replacement in Mort; a clumsy, self-conscious youth who seems cannot do anything correctly.  Death did not know that when he brought Mort on as his apprentice. Queue wackiness. In the aftermath they both realize that their place in life found them without any help.    Once again, Terry Pratchet has shown why he is counted among the best fantasy writers in the business. His wit and intelligence illuminate every page and I would highly recommend this to any fantasy reader who values mirth as much as content.    In addition, there are two great \\"So you would like to. . .\\" lists that show the exact chronology of the series that I found most helpful. You may want to look them up to figure out where you would like to start.	2004-10-21

This is the book that helped start the cyber punk genre (written in 1985 for crying-out-loud), written in a stream of thought style (don't worry it's no Finnegan's Wake) that can be hard to follow at times. If you're used to reading authors such as Philip K. Dick this should be no problem for you.    A hacker, Case, double crosses an employer who then destroys the neurons that enable his cyberspace travel. A new employer with a dubious background offers to fix the supposedly irreversible damage in exchange for an even more dubious job. The books break-neck pace lasts through the whole book; reading it is like drinking five double espressos and playing Rez on PlayStation 2 till three A.M.    I can recommend this to erudite readers who have yet to enter the Cyberpunk arena. I know I'll be reading more soon.	2004-10-01

The main theme of book three is the family reuniting to try to find Brand. The whole way through the book you'll be wondering who imprisoned him, all of the siblings add their own pontification and each has very valid points. You'll never guess who it was.    Also, new shadows are introduced (the world of the clouds has to be my favorite so far), and some great new Questions arise. The main one being: is Amber itself a shadow? And are Corwinn and his siblings princes' of the true Amber?    If you read the first two I'm not sure why you would even be reading this, but if you haven't I would recommend the first two highly and trust me they only get better and better.	2004-09-30

How can I keep from running away while screaming and tearing at my hair? This novel was given birth by those ideas. It is good but at most it seems like a daydream.

But I'm used to reading John Barth and Philip K. Dick novels; they are good preparation for the jumpy narrative and time line. If you can stand to be perplexed for the better part of each chapter (as to exact time and character/s that your dealing with), than you'll absolutely love this book. If you're easily confused or are looking for a quick read, than you may want to look else where.    With that aside, I would compare the battle scenes to a more poetic Robert Jordan.

With that said, I love PKD, and have read quite a few of his works. I, having been aclimated to his style, found it very enjoyable. The only concerns I have are that some of the ideas, with reguards to the backwards flow of time, are somewhat garbled. A good example is how cigeretts are smoked by inhaling the fumes and blowing into the filter- yet the people still manage to communicate while inhaling. Try it yourself, see it's not so easy. I know it's nit-picky, I can't help it.    All in all a great book for anyone who already enjoys PKD.	2004-08-26

Or maybe you're the kind of person who likes the philosophical, thought provoking style of Tom Robbins. If either of these authors are your cup of tea then you will most definitely like this book.    Like most of Moore's books, you have to suspend your disbeliefs while you read. Some of his ideas are so far-out that they seem sort of silly. But that is what Moore is all about. He does manage to add meaningful dialog about the nature of depression and antidepressants. He does admit the usefulness of the latter while showing the necessity of the former. A major problem in psychology is pointed out also; does your doctor show a lack of interest in your mental problems? You know, when you're telling your doctor that you've been feeling down and he/she already has the prescription for a new medication half way written out before you are even done giving your symptoms, just something to think about.    Also, if you like this kind of wacky adventure you may want to check out \\"Stormy Weather\\" or \\"Tourist Season\\" by Carl Hiaasan.

Now, do you remember anything from the class? If you're like me, you do; now you know why that teacher was so crass. Not everyone likes the technique but darn-it it works.

US	28004833	R185NT5NFA67OF	0060558121	337033298	American Gods	Books	5	1	1	N	N	alot of truth	In a world of constantly evolving beliefs and morals, this book stands to try to explain why we as Americans feel pressure to change our spiritual selves. Using Shadow to stand for our evolving society Gaiman shows how we WILL make it out the other side and how the new and old can coexist.<br /><br />With that said, the best parts of this book are the small bits of historical fiction interlaced with the main story that explain how some of the gods came to America in the first place. It has piqued my interest in old religions and an interest that goes beyond a book is the highest acolyte I can give.	2004-03-11

It reminded me of the movie \\"the Ring\\" when the actors look out at the crowd at the end.        This is simply a great book and I would not even classify it as Sci-fi only as fiction. By the end of the book, I felt as if I knew the characters personally. I especially empathized with the storeowner and his search for a place and a meaning in his world. Did you figure out why he could not?        If you do not like to think through ideas on your own without having the author spell them out for you then this is not the book for you. However, if you are prone to contemplation I would highly recommend it.	2004-02-17

I did not think he could out do the first in the series but to my pleasant surprise, he did. This book along with the first evokes such a staggering felling of wonder that at points during reading I could barely contain the swelling of my heart. I would recommend this to anyone that loves to feel powerful emotions while reading; in my opinion the greatest test of a book. I cannot wait for the third.	2004-01-22

On the other hand if you like an interesting story with many crazy facts and even crazier ideas you will love this. I have read it and listened to it(on tape) at least eight times.	2003-11-06
US	28004833	R4AQLU5Z1YGGH	0380977265	468229732	Dandelion Wine	Books	5	0	0	N	N	small town delight	This book has inspired me to move to the countryside with my family and enjoy life. Why have we as a people gone to the cities away from family and friends? Was it money? Was it the false dream of fame and success? Dandelion Wine helped me see that success is having the love of your family and the warmth of a good home. Without those, the rest means nothing.	2003-11-06
US	28004833	RA6YM7VUQ3WYH	0553564943	930626996	Magician: Apprentice	Books	4	2	4	N	N	No filler	This may not be for the technically minded. It is however for the reader who longs for a sense of magic once felt while young. The magic lost in real life. This book made me want to look for more interesting biology and science books. It is a great leap ahead of his book \\"the lives of a cell\\". Many people will equate this with Tolkien. There are many hints at great back story lines and quite a few events that will become legend in this universe. The scene with the dying dragon will stick with me throughout the series and after.<br /><br />The best part for me was the exclusion of ultra realistic descriptions of every horse, castle, cart, tree etc. as some of the other fantasy writers tend to do. All in all this is great read full of promise.	2003-11-05
