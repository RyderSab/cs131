Lowe Dr. P.H., FAHPA, FAAHB	Review: Prevention of Skin Cancer, Edited by David Hill, J. Mark Elwood, and Dallas R. English<br />This book, part of the series Cancer Prevention - Cancer Control, is one of the most comprehensive texts on the prevention of skin cancer published to date.  This volume investigates skin cancer prevention from the etiology and epidemiology of skin cancer prevention to the efficacy of interventions. In addition, the 16 chapters in the book provide information on other areas such as solar and ultraviolet radiation, stratospheric ozone depletion, the influence of genetics, solaria usage, patterns of sun exposures and an economic perspective of skin cancer prevention programs. Each chapter provides an excellent overview of current scientific knowledge in these areas and ends with a section entitled \\"Implications for Public Health\\" that helps to frame the discussion from a public health perspective.<br />The editors are well known in the field of cancer prevention.  Professor David Hill's work as a behavioral scientist in cancer control and prevention is international. He has been a prolific researcher in skin cancer prevention and has been involved with Australia's Sun Smart program for many years. His co-editors Professors Elwood and English are distinguished epidemiologists, and experienced in the area of skin cancer prevention.   The book, according to the editors, was initiated as an outcome of a workshop held in Melbourne, Australia.  The editors brought together both Australian and international researchers, distinguished in the area of cancer control and prevention, to write the chapters.  <br />The book appears to be geared toward a wide diverse range of multiple audiences.  The publishers' state it is an essential reference/handbook for public health and health promotion practitioners and researchers, and add that it would be of interest to dermatologists, epidemiologists and anyone with an interest in skin cancer.   However with reference to the first two audiences it must be noted that most chapter sections on \\"Implication for Public Health\\" are modest, and while they reinforce what is known they do not suggest new directions. However, this book may be a great resource for those individuals who participate peripherally in skin cancer prevention and might not be as aware of the state of the science in all its dimensions.  To the individual who is thinking of getting into the area of skin cancer prevention, this book is a must to read.  Each chapter summarizes and synthesizes an enormous amount of literature in a very readable fashion.<br /> I would recommend this book as required reading for all those in the area of cancer control and prevention as it, in the year 2004, is the most relevant and up to date comprehensive review of all aspects of skin cancer prevention. <BR>I hope that the area of skin cancer prevention continues to make strides in finding new science as is evidenced by the work presented in this book. If so, we can look forward to the 2nd edition of this book.	2004-01-20

Also, it has become apparent that there are several environmental and industrial toxins thatcan cause nephropathy. Clinical Nephrotoxins: Renal Injury From Drugs and Chemicals is a hardcover book that explores the mechanisms by which medications, environmental toxins, and industrial <BR>toxins can cause renal disease. The book is a  712-page, 35-chapter work, written by 95 international authors.<br />Most chapters have contributions from multiple authors and provide very good, up-to-date information and a very thorough reference list. Most of the chapters flow very well, often commenting (when applicable) on clinical manifestations, pathology, pathophysiology of renal injury (known or suspected), <BR>and preventive measures. However, I will say that a couple of chapters did not follow this form, and I was slightly disappointed with these chapters. All chapters have figures and tables, including pictures of biopsies, when applicable. I found the figures and tables to be quite helpful and aided in my understanding of the topic being presented. <BR>Overall, this book provides a very good overview on the mechanisms of drug- and toxin induced nephropathy.Up-to-date information on current clinically relevant medications (including herbal) and worldwide environmental and industrial toxins is provided. It would be a welcome addition to any health care provider's collection of reference books. <br />Bhavin Patel, PharmD <BR>Nephrology Clinical Pharmacy Specialist <BR>Hennepin County Medical Center <BR>Minneapolis, Minnesota <BR>American Journal of Kidney Diseases, Vol 42, No 6 (December), 2003: p 1324 1324	2004-01-09

Thus there is a principal question that this book aims to answer:&quot;How can psychology help in the development of a sustainable society?&quot;  The authors demonstrate that psychology has an important role in the sense of promoting sustainable values, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours. The contributors show us that sustainable development involves the simultaneous pursuit of economic prosperity, environmental quality, political participation, and social equity.<br />........This book maps the four primary domains that need be considered to achieve sustainable development: economic, environmental, institutional/political, and social.  Although the book presents a psychology viewpoint, it will benefit any interested reader in environmental studies.&quot;	2003-11-14

Extensive changes in this area have occurred over the last 20 years, introducing new concepts and practices, such as just-in-time manufacturing and total quality management.<br />Approximately 1,100 articles are included in the encyclopedia. About 1,000 of these are short, paragraph-length entries that introduce new concepts, principles, and practices, such as genetic algorithms. The remaining 100 articles, which are each five to ten pages long, offer up-to-date coverage of complex activities, such as product development. All the major articles and many of the shorter ones provide references to important research on this topic. New concepts and practices are often tied to specific companies, and in many of the articles, \\"real-world\\" examples are given.<br />The editor provides myriad ways of finding needed information. The table-of-contents includes a list of all articles in the encyclopedia, arranged alphabetically by the article headings. A separate list of the lengthier, major articles are provided, also arranged alphabetically by the article heading. Some keyword terms mentioned in the articles (e.g., Valdez principles and MAINOPT) do not have their own entries, but they can be located by using the subject-name index.<br />Some of the additional indexes are unique reference sources in themselves. Most notable is an index of the \\"real-world\\" companies and organizations featured in the articles. The references cited by these articles lead the reader to a prepared list of articles that are usually scattered across a variety of trade journals. The editor included two bibliographies, both composed of the references cited by the articles. The first is arranged alphabetically by author, the second by topic, allowing the reader to search for additional information by both author and subject.<br />This encyclopedia is important addition to any academic library supporting teaching and research in business or engineering, and it would be useful for managers in company or organizational settings. It not only details innovations in the area of production and manufacturing management, but also links them to related concepts and practices through extensive cross-referencing of entries. The encyclopedia is a bit pricey ..., but it is a well-constructed, well-written publication that offers state-of-the-art coverage.	2002-11-06
