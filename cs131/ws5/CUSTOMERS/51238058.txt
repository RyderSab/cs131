Has your relationship gone stale?  Are you trying to understand your mate?  Are you feeling `Clueless'\\"?  If you can say, \\"yes\\" to one or more of these questions, then maybe this is the book for you.<br /><br /> What does it take to get your significant other to woo and romance you?  How about being honest with your mate and giving them a clue as to what you need?  This is the premise on which author Bobbie Reid bases her advice.<br /><br />Like so much advice we get, we hear it often, know it, but don't act on it.  This small volume encourages readers to act upon our impulses, make the changes ourselves and encourage our loved one to make positive changes, too.  Nothing will improve if we don't speak up to our mates and speak out about what we want.  Therein is the magic of Clueless.  The book discusses ways that can help couples graciously and gently keep their relationships strong, while making them even better.<br /><br /> Each of the book's sections discusses an area the lives of couples that can affect the failure or success of a partnership.  For instance, Chapter 9 is titled Talking and Listening.  \\"Women want men to talk to them.  Women want men to talk with them.  But most of all, women want men to listen to them.  Talking to each other has a different rating scale for men and women.  Truthfully, men want women to listen to them too, but the subject matter and degree of importance placed on communication may be different,\\" says Reid.  After talking about the experiences of men and women who did or did not talk and listen to each other, Reid suggests what may have made a difference in a relationship gone wrong.<br /><br /> At the end of Chapter 9, under \\"Real Solutions,\\" she lists what men should be aware of.  \\"When a woman is very clear about her likes and dislikes, the man she loves should listen,\\" she says.<br /><br /> Advice for the female partner is, \\"Try to state clearly what you'd like for a present, keeping his financial state in mind.  Write it on his personal calendar.  Cut out pictures from magazines and catalogs.  Print out an internet site . . ..\\"  How can he possible miss all this?  If he does, he is definitely clueless.<br /><br /> Clueless is a user-friendly book that is a fast and easy read.  The advice may sound like common sense, but maybe couples need to be more aware of the common sense things of marriage.  Maybe divorce rates wouldn't be so high if we used thoughtfulness and common sense.financial state in mind.   Write it on his personal calendar.   Cut out pictures from magazines and catalogs.

Among other questions, Susan Jeffers, PhD, answers the age old question,  \\"What Does Real Love Really Look Like?\\" in her book The Feel the Fear Guide to Lasting Love.  Can you answer the question?  The answer may not be what you expect, and the answer is well worth reading.<br /><br /> Through examples of couples she interviews, Jeffers shows us how her advice on how to correct love related problems can work.  Some of her advice is hard to swallow, however.  Jeffers tells us that many of our problems with others whom we love could be solved if we hold up a mirror and take a good hard look at ourselves.<br /><br /> \\"Now that you are coming to the realization that you are powerful and loving and have nothing to fear,\\" Jeffers, says, \\"I invite you to use your power and love in a creative and exciting way.  And that is to work toward improving your relationship (or finding one) all by yourself,\\" she counsels.<br /><br />All by myself, I can hear you asking.  What about him/her?<br /><br /> There in lies Jeffers' secret to a happy, successful relationship.  Spend your energy, time and effort fixing yourself and taking care of yourself, not worrying about what needs to be fixed or what is wrong with your spouse.  And that is what makes her advice hard to follow.  You may have to be silent, giving, loving and responsible when your mate isn't any of those things.<br /><br /> To help overcome the possible obstacles in following her advice, Jeffers lists and discusses \\"Love Lessons\\" that include:<br /><br /> *Expanding your words of love one week at a time.<br /><br /> *Talk beautifully about your mate in the company of others.<br /><br /> *Be who you want your partner to be.<br /><br /> *Make time.<br /><br /> *Become a romantic.<br /><br /> *Appreciate the little things.<br /><br /> *Focus on abundance.<br /><br /> *Remember to have patience.<br /><br /> Along with listing these golden rules, she tells readers how to achieve results by practicing them.<br /><br />Lessons in compassion, how to find your \\"Higher Self,\\" and how to give to get what you want in life area bundant in this volume.

The death of his parents, the memory of his, \\" . . . ghostly grandmother - with her salty fingers, claw-like hands, sallow hollow cheeks, loose false teeth, . . ..\\"  The meeting of a girl friend's older brother who was named Jack Shema, but became to be known as Hakki Bey, the boy who was brilliant, artistic, self destructive and beat his sister from time-to-time.  He tells of Sharon, the sister whom he took to Tokyo for an abortion.<br /><br />Zabor tells his experiences and memories lyrically and honestly.  Many passages are compelling.  Some of the writing is long winded, however, and my interest waned. but something always pulled me back into the story.  Zabor shows readers the world as he sees it competently and interestingly.  He admits that he does not clearly understand everything that happens in his life and this confession allows readers to identify with him.  How many of us understand our lives?<br /><br />Through detailed and sensitive writing Wabenzi:  A Souvenir allows readers to get inside his mind to see what he sees, feel what he feels and he lets readers contemplate his regrets along with him.<br /><br /> Zabor is a jazz drummer and that's how he writes - with improvisation and a forceful rhythm.  I enjoyed Zabor's writing most when he talked about his passion - music.  That's where the best writing comes from, passion.<br /><br /> Reading Wabenzi:  A Souvenir will take some work.  It is not and easy read, but it is worthwhile.	2005-09-26

The area was a whirlpool that attracted psychedelic drugs and druggies, hippies, politicos, and soon-to-be famous bands, among other American oddities.<br /><br />Bob Dylan, The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and the Hell's Angels could be found at dance-hall scenes lit by psychedelic light shows.  It was a two-year span, from 1964 to 1966, of acid, Timothy Leary and the Vietnam War.  Song lyrics held secret and not so secret messages of drugs and protest.  \\"It was the best of times; it was the worst of times,\\" as Dickens would say.<br /><br />The Haight-Ashbury:  A History starts out a little slow, especially if you are not familiar with that time and place in history.  Perry was an insider of the happenings during the, \\"summer of love,\\" as Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead calls the two-year span, and Perry knows vernacular of the time and place which is much like a foreign language to those of us who are uninformed.  He knows the names, businesses, bands, people and the happenings.  If all this is news to you, it's a little hard to trudge through this information and make sense of it.<br /><br />But, if you remember the period, or are curious about the drug culture of the 60s, or if the history of rock bands intrigues you, this is definitely a book for you.  There is a 71-page section where Perry writes a journal of the events that happened April through October of 1967.  Local police were getting tough on drugs; residents of the Haight were tiring of tour busses full of people invading their space.  The darker side of the Haight was emerging.  I found this one section to be an interesting essay on society in general.<br /><br />Toward the book's end, Perry ties the Haight-Ashbury events with what was happening and what had happened around the world and understanding of the \\"Bay area Vortex,\\" becomes clearer.  I went back and reread the opening chapters that seemed confusing at first, but now they made sense.  Despite the, \\" . . .bitterest disappointments and most violent disruption, . . .\\" noted, Perry ends the book with an uplifting message and uses the history of Haight-Ashbury as an example of a Phoenix that arises from the ashes.  An intriguing concept.<br /><br />Sixteen pages of black and white photographs will bring memories of the events and people to the minds of those who saw this time.  For those who are just learning about the era the photographs make the message clearer.  You can see a young Jefferson Airplane and Grateful Dead.  Timothy Leary shows a faint smile for the photographer and George Harrison is surrounded by admirers on Hippie Hill, August 7, 1967.  Samples of the clothes, the art and the hair abound.<br /><br />Educated at Princeton University and the University of California, Berkeley, Perry followed the psychedelic subculture from 1965 until 1968, when he applied for a job at the Rolling Stone Magazine.  Later, he became interested in the history of Middle Eastern food and is now an internationally known authority on this subject.eemed confusing at first, but now they made sense.

A knot of people joined by blood and marriage, leading interwoven lives.  The story opens with the death of family patriarch, Nick Cantini, who is the piece of fabric that adds the color, warmth and strength to the family quilt.<br /><br />Johnny Cantini, Nick's oldest son, is left holding the needle and thread that stitches the family together.  Johnny must continue with the small business his father built while trying to fill his father's shoes as the family's head.<br /><br />To complicate things more, just before his death, Nick makes confession and a last request to Johnny.  Little did anyone - least of all Johnny - know what fulfilling that last request would entail.  Little did Johnny know that his father's confession wasn't the secret Johnny thought it should be.<br /><br />Set in Providence, Rhode Island, the story has a 1950s feel to it.  It is reminiscent of a time when families sat down, ate together and solved all their problems together.  A time of good-humored kidding amongst people who really care about each other and when family values counted.  It is a story about the warmth of knowing people love and need you.  About and honor and taking responsibility.<br /><br />What makes this story most intriguing and humorous is that the deceased Cantini watches the family's happenings and comments to readers about the activities.  (His family members don't hear or see him.)  And to keep things interesting, there is surprise twist at the story's end.<br /><br /> Don't let my referral to the 1950s scare you off from reading this enjoyable novel.  The problems the Cantini family face are as current as tomorrow's stock report, as old as time itself.  If you are fortunate, you will soon start to see your family members in the Cantini family.  If you are not lucky enough to have a squabbling, loving, extended family I'm sure the Cantini's will have you over for dinner and make you feel right at home.me. <br /> <br />	2005-09-26

The destitute playing troupe of performers made up of Joliffe, Basset and his daughter Rose, her son Piers and her love Ellis, had a stroke of very good luck.  After years of traveling the countryside hoping for a few coins that would allow them to survive, they come under patronage of generous Lord Lovell.  Their prayers had been answered, thought the actors.  The only request Lord Lovell made was that the troupe takes on Gil Densell, the young son of one of Lovell's bailiffs, as an apprentice.  How could their generous patron be denied such a small favor?<br /><br />Lord Lovell added to the troupe's good fortune by providing them with a very good job.  The son of Lord Lovell's landholder and daughter of his friend, Sir Edmund Deneby, were to be married.  The troupe was asked to go to Deneby Manor and perform as a betrothal present for the young couple.  And while there, Lord Lovell says, \\"I wanted to be able to call on your wits if need be.\\"<br /><br />The bride-to-be was recently betrothed to another man - a man who died under suspicious circumstances shortly before the wedding.  And her current marriage seemed rushed.  Lovell wants to know what is going on behind the scenes.<br /><br />While at Deneby Manor and during the readying for the celebration, the actors had a warm dry place to stay, good company and regular, meals.  All considered luxuries to the once struggling actors.  Joliffe, who was very popular with all who lived at the manor and the townspeople, found it easy to gather information about the Denebys.<br /><br />Not hard to uncover was the evident distaste the promised bride and her mother, Lady Benedicta, had for each other and the wall of ice that stood between the bride's parents.  Other mysteries, however, are harder to unravel.<br /><br />The story is slow to start, but the delay is well worth it.  Frazer holds your interest with deftly drawn characters acting in a stage of intricate and accurate details of medieval life.  The author's attention to the factual events and trimmings of a performance troupe from that period, add to the delight of the story.<br /><br />As the book ends, the answers to the mysteries are exposed and answers that one would never imagine appear.<br /><br />History and mystery buffs alike,  will enjoy A Play of Dux Moraud.the factual events and trimmings of a performance troupe from that period, add to the delight of the story. <br />As the book ends, the answers to the mysteries are exposed and answers that one would never imagine appear. <br />History and mystery buffs alike,  will enjoy A Play of Dux Moraud. <br />	2005-09-26

She is now a widow and must move, leaving behind years of memories.  Along with the house where she and Jim had raised their children Mildred must leave behind her apple orchards and horses.  That's a lot to leave behind.<br /><br />While cleaning out her attic and preparing to leave, she comes across a Sears Roebuck catalogs and a box.<br /><br />Scrawled across the top of the box in Jim's writing is this message:<br /><br />DO NOT OPEN! DO NOT THROW AWAY!<br /><br />ALWAYS REMEMBER! DON'T EVER FORGET!<br /><br />ALL THAT GLITTERS AIN'T GOLD,<br /><br />IMPORTANT THINGS CAN'T BE BOUGHT AND SOLD.<br /><br />Mildred knew immediately what the message meant.  The year the tree had been  purchased was a year of change for the Jackson family.  Seeing the box brought back a rush of emotions.  Some good, some not so good.<br /><br />  When alive, her husband, Jim, had always looked through the catalogs and wondered what it would be like to be able to buy all the things he craved for his family.  Then one day Jim got a promotion and he could finally afford all the things he'd dreamed about buying and one thing he wanted to buy was the aluminum Christmas tree.<br /><br />Sounds like a perfect ending to a perfect story, right?

His real father figures while growing up consisted of an eclectic collection of alcohol soaked, cigarette smoking male characters - in the truest sense of the term \\"characters\\" - who hung out at a corner bar called \\"Dickens\\".  Surrounded by this circle of tenderhearted friends and mentors in the pub's cool darkness, R.J. (his real name, as he had to clarify to almost everyone he met) he learned about caring, life and being a man.<br /><br />Still, life without a father and bouncing back and forth between tiny one-bedroom apartments to his grandfather's house was tough.  Moehringer didn't let circumstances beyond his control stunt his ambitions, however.  He graduated from Yale University, won the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing, and is a successful novelist and national correspondent for the Los Angeles Times.<br /><br />Moehringer tells of the hole his missing father bore in his heart and soul without being maudlin.  He also relates the joys of being mentored by the several caring men who cheer him on as he journeys through life.  When it comes right down to it, he may be more fortunate than many other fatherless children.  The love between him and his mother is unquestionable and he was guided and cared for by the many members of his extended dysfunctional family with whom he shared the crowded home of his grandfather.  He is proof positive that nurturing and love can come from many different places and sources and that the results of such caring depends more on the receiver than the givers.<br /><br /> The Tender Bar: A Memoir is interesting and lively and even though I am a female, raised with both parents present in my life, I can relate to much of what Moehringer shares in his well written and interesting book.	2005-09-26

The memoir doesn't have an actual story line beyond the day-to-day experiences of Brown as a child.  This doesn't give the reader reason to keep turning the pages to find out what happens.  It is more a diary of what happened during Brown's childhood.  She had an unusual life, true, but I just wasn't drawn into the story.  She tells the story from the vantage point of someone self-absorbed with herself.<br /><br /> Brown tells about \\"Baba,\\" a self-proclaimed spiritual leader, all through the book. The spiritual leader her parents followed is part of the story, but this entity was mentioned in the first 10 chapters to the point of distraction - several times on each page.  Brown makes him a central character along with herself and he is not quite worth that much attention.  Then at the end of the book Brown makes a surprising confession about her feelings toward this person, whom she or her parents never met.<br /><br />While attending the Holy Wounds of Jesus Christ the Savior School, Brown was harassed by the other students because she was an n American, a foreigner.  Sad and regrettable, of course, but in the book, she depicts herself as a child who wouldn't have been easy to warm up to and that made it hard to become emotionally involved with what happened to her.<br /><br /> One reason for this is that Brown was a precocious child and we are reminded of that many times.  In some instances she makes it clear, she knows more than most adults.  This may have been true, but a reader only has to be told once.<br /><br /> Brown says that she tried to write this memoir several times.  \\"I'd try a few times, but all my attempts had gotten bogged down in fury, self-pity or wild speculations about my parents' motivation.  I was bored reading them.\\"<br /><br />Reading All the Fishes Come Home to Roost left me with the same feelings she experienced reading her first drafts. I don't think she has yet overcome the obstacles from her past.<br /><br />Finally, from chapter 29 forward, the memoir becomes more intriguing.  Brown starts to reveal herself, not in a self-indulgent way, but as who she really is.  She reveals her thoughts about and interests beyond those of herself.  Perhaps she will try to write another memoir, starting from chapter 29 of this one.e feelings she experienced reading her first drafts.

Some particulars are raw and cruel, as was much of life in the mid-to-late sixteenth century up to the early 1700s.  Others tell of passionate love, heroic bravery and the beauty and truth of the Age of Enlightenment.<br /><br />Intelligent, daring, passionate and beautiful, Ruth Bas Elazar Saul is called an enchantress or witch by some, a gifted midwife or student of scientia nova by others.<br /><br />A woman born centuries before her time, Ruth is the daughter of Elazar Ben Saul, the chief rabbi of the Jewish quarter of Deutz, Cologne, Germany, but that offers her no special treatment and, in fact, complicates her life.<br /><br />Ruth has no time in her life for love and in fact, decides her studies and work are much more pleasing and important.  Then Detleff Von Tennen, Canon to the cathedral, enters her life and she discovers the power and comfort of love.  And not until Detleff does Ruth meet her equal.  Detleff however, is a Christian.<br /><br />Written with great intelligence and care, The Witch of Cologne is spellbinding, intriguing and touched with erotica.  A warning, some passages reflect the era's superstitions and cruelty and are not for the faint-of-heart or squeamish.	2005-09-26

A poetic study of mankind written with clarity and a fondness for all who find themselves caught in the sphere of time.<br /><br />I'm not a left-brain person, so the science in this small volume went right over my head, but the words went right to my heart.<br /><br />All the blurbs on the back cover that promise an odd, clever, mystical, endlessly fascinating and delightful read are correct.<br /><br />I'm so glad I took the time to read this book.	2005-09-15

Author Dorinne S. Davis, MA, CCC-A, FAAA, has over 35 years as an educational and rehabilitative audiologist and certainly has the credentials<br /><br />The first four chapters of this book contain detailed information about the physics of sound, the body's reaction to sound, the auditory system and processes of this system.  Factual and well written, this intricate information is presented in terms a layperson can easily understand.<br /><br />Chapters five through seven introduce readers to the various methods of sound therapy, their creators, methods and case studies supporting the techniques.<br /><br />Chapter eight describes the powers and uses of the voice.  This chapter offers medically based, but an understandable introduction to the physiological functioning of the voice.  This is an educational as well as interesting chapter.  Chapter nine discusses BioAcoustics, an explanation of, \\"This Signature Sound,\\" of an individual and how our unique vocal frequencies affect us.<br /><br />Chapter ten ties the various therapies and the physiology of our bodies together and how, \\"All of the physiological processes in the body are interlinked by a large number of interacting and crisscrossing pathways.\\"  Or, the how and why sound therapies and how they may stimulate the voice-ear-brain connections.  Chapter 11 relates real-life success stories of sound therapies.<br /><br />Although this book is a little off the beaten track and may be seen as interest to people involved in the field of medicine only, I found the book worthy of my reading/leisure time.  Most certainly, Sound Bodies through Sound Therapy will be of interest to any parent who has a child with symptoms or a diagnosis of autism, apraxia, ADD.ADHD, dyslexia, hyperlexia, Central Auditory Processing Disorder or learning disorders.sorder or learning disorders. <br />  <br />	2005-07-02

But it is 1846 and now she must cope with the harsh realities of the Irish Famine.  While potato crops turn to blighted foul slush in the fields,  Margaret studies the vocation of being a keener - one who takes on the burden of grieving for the dead - under the tutelage of the aged Nuala Lynch.  Margaret learns her duties quickly.  It seems death has touched each family, some several times, in her once idyllic home in Ireland.<br /><br />There is a bright spot in Margaret's life, however.  She knows she will have a future with the  handsome Tom Riordan.  But the devastation surrounding the two leaves no one untouched and Tom is declared a wanted criminal.  Their only escape from the horrific life they are experiencing is to take a ship to America and leave their beloved Ireland behind.  The voyage to the land of promise is hellish, but once they reach Troy, New York, things start looking brighter.<br /><br />Well-researched facts, likeable characters and a compelling story are told between the covers of The Keeners.  Competently written, Shaw writes a moving story that takes the reader through the heartaches and joys and the decay and resurrection experienced by the Irish during a time of revolution and turmoil.	2005-04-18

The Lovely Bones held my attention long enough for me to finish it.  The writing, in places is weak, but then the person telling the story is a 14 year old and the text reads like a 14 year old might speak.  I thought the viewpoint (that of a young girl in heaven) of the main character was different and interesting.  Descriptions of heaven were not too clear nor appealing, but how many readers know what heaven is really like?  I was confused by the mother's reaction to everything, but admired the father.  The little brother, Buckley, is likable, the sister, Lindsey, is not. The likability of this book - more than most - seems to depend on the reader's taste.	2002-12-09

If you have ever owned a Hasselblad you most likely have a copy of Ernst Wildi's The Hasselblad Manual -  virtual bible for Hasselbald owners.  Once again Wildi exhibits his mastery of photographic equipment in this book, Photographic Lenses: A photographer's guide to characteristics, quality, use and design.  Have you ever confused depth of field with depth of focus?  Wildi will set you straight.  Clear diagrams, succinct, precise and clear writing and wonderful images abound in this 125-page volume.  There is nothing left out of this book.  Wildi discusses lens characteristics, understanding advertising claims, lenses for film and digital photography, lens specifications, focal lengths and zoom lenses.  And those are just the first few subjects talked about in chapter one.  Don't let the number of topics lead you to think that the subjects aren't covered thoroughly, though.  They are.  The information is clear enough for beginners to understand, informational enough for pros to learn something new.  You can't go wrong with this volume.	2002-08-17

This 125-page book is an introduction to moving your wedding photography into the digital world, but it is also a guide to further your business if you are already involved in digital photography.  The generously illustrated volume discusses the advantages of digital photography and what may be behind your efforts of avoiding the digital arena.  Okay - you've made the plunge and are willing to advance to digital photography.  Now what?  Where to begin?  The author suggests you, \\"Look before you leap, but don't overanalyze!\\"  He then discusses your decision-making type and how to deal with the \\"cheetah thinkers and the turtle thinkers\\" (do you know your style?). Authors Jeff and Kathleen Hawkins then give you names and numbers for organizations and publications that will help you enter the digital world.  Selecting equipment is discussed as is time management, delegating tasks in your business, marketing and the actual photographing of digital weddings.  Chapters 9-12 help with the after-the-wedding process and album design.  Chapter 13 offers advice from industry professionals in the digital world of photography.  I think that's a lot of information for one slim volume.	2002-08-17

Fine Art Children's Photography: Techniques &amp; Images in Black and White<br />by Doris Carol Doyle and Ian Doyle  Soft cover, 127 pages. Amherst Media, Inc.<br /> I like this book very much because the  photographer/author stresses something I have always believed--a child  doesn't have to look perfect, prim and proper for a portrait.  In fact,  professional portraits of your child having fun and just being a child will  probably be your family's favorite and best remembered photographs.  The  use of black and white film for these photographs gives them a character  and style of their own, and lifts them from the realm of being  informal  snapshots to the medium of art.  Photographer Doris Carol Doyle  introduces herself in the front of the book and tells how she started doing  children's portraiture in her home, using equipment and props that were  available.  She produced some striking images, so if you are getting  started as a photographer her example will give you confidence that you  don't have to have a complete and expensive studio to get started.  Accompanying each image is a diagram of the layout she used, and a complete  description of her equipment.  Doyle takes the time to discuss the little  things that make all the difference when taking a portrait.  For instance,  seating the subject a little lower than the camera causes the child to look  up, showing more of the whites of their eyes and making the eyes look  bigger and brighter.  By watching a child's hands and stance you can get an  idea of their comfort level and she stresses don't limit yourself where  backgrounds are concerned.  Parks, fences, buildings and beaches make  delightful backdrops for children's portraiture.  Doyle includes a  section for various age groups of children in her book.  This is helpful,  because each age brings new delights and new problems.  She discusses  photographing a child with their pet, their friends, family members,  favorite things and while involved in favorite activities.  Location  shooting is discussed as are using fill flash, reflectors and natural  light.  A smaller photograph shows the exact placement of the camera, flash  and reflectors for many of the images.  A complete description of the area  and circumstances during the shoot is explained.  Most important,  Doyle uses examples of her photographs where the child's face is not key to  the image, and how such images can be successful.  A photograph on the back  book cover shows two young boys walking away from the camera.  They are on  a beach, the taller of the two has his arm around the shoulder of the  smaller boy.  If this were an image of my two sons, I know this photograph  would be a favorite of mine.  Children are shown giggling, laughing and  looking down at things.  Childhood is such a fleeting time, it's  important to have photographs of your children enjoying that wonderful,  magical season and this book will help you do that.  Because of the  small details Doyle shares with readers, the ease of reading and the clear  illustrations, I give this book a strong four star rating.<br />Marilyn  Dalrympleorite activities.

There are  things you must know about infrared film, however, in order to create the  haunting, dreamlike images this unusual film can produce.  Learning how  to use infrared film need not be difficult or complicated, and  photographer/author Joseph Paduano proves this in his book, The Art of  Infrared Photography.  Paduano covers all that needs to be known in clear  language and uses a portfolio of his work to demonstrate his points.  Enough infrared theory is discussed so anyone unfamiliar with the film can  understand what makes it different and why.  But Paduano does this without  using terms and language that only a scientist could understand.  The  qualities that make infrared images so different and interesting are the  grain and the haunting white appearance of some subject matter  photographed.  In detail, Paduano explains what subject matter photographs  best with infrared film and why.  For instance, certain trees-- pine, firs,  spruce, for example--don't record as well on infrared film as trees with  large leaves.  The reason for this is that, &quot;The chlorophyll leaf and  blade structures in a healthy plant absorb visible light and reflect most  of the infrared radiation to which the film is sensitive.&quot;  Paduano  goes on to explain which objects and colors best reflect or transmits the  infrared wavelength and offers his photographs to illustrate his comments.  There are clear illustrations and instructions that explain how to  handle the film, load your camera and unload and prepare for processing  this sensitive film.  Infrared film could not be discussed without the  rules of focusing and the use of filters being addressed.  Filters for  infrared, filter factors and exposure compensations are listed in an  easy-to-read chart.  Again, Paduano's images illustrate the differences the  various filters make.  Film speeds, image grains and why these  components are important to the success of your photographs are covered in  detail in chapter 4.  Chapter 5 goes into greater detail about exposure  and filters and the different circumstances that effect the film.  In  chapter 6 you will learn how to expose the film by using timed exposures  and/or flash.  Specific instructions are given on processing and printing  your film in chapter 7.  Once you have mastered infrared photography  you may want to further enhance your images with toning or hand coloring.  These techniques are explained and illustrated as is the use of color  infrared film.  Digital infrared cameras are described, explained and  compared in chapter 10.  The last half of the book contains a  portfolio of Paduano's images.  These photographs clearly show the variety  of effects you can achieve with infrared film and are fuel for any  photographer's imagination.  I found this 100 page, soft cover volume  easy to understand, thorough in explanations, encouraging and motivating.  An excellent addition to your photography library, I give The Art of  Infrared Photography a healthy four out of five stars.<br />Marilyn Dalrymplen, Paduano's images illustrate the differences the  various filters make.

Her work is sold as fine art and has  been featured in exhibits.  In the Infrared Photography Handbook, White  shares all she has learned about this unusual and fascinating film.  If  you have never used infrared film before, don't let the technical terms and  information shown in this book scare you.  White discusses and explains the  &quot;Electromagnetic Spectrum,&quot; &quot;wavelength,&quot; the  &quot;Photographic Spectrum,&quot; &quot;Spectral Ranges of Film  Sensitivity, and the &quot;Infrared Spectrum.&quot;  Large and clear  illustrations show us, and easy to understand language tells us, exactly  what the terms mean and why we need to know this information.  Key material  is repeated in boxes for easy review  Even so, this book will take some  work and study for most, and may seem daunting to newer photographers.  For  photographers who have already studied light, however, this book offers a  good review of the subject.  White has done a thorough and competent job of  discussing the physics of light.  .  White literally takes us by  the hand and walks us through our first roll of infrared film.  Our first  assignment is to shoot a roll of film and take notes of the conditions  under which the film was shot, then analyzing our results.  Once  familiar with the film, White leads us on to &quot;Advanced Theory.&quot;  The topics light sources and color temperature are reviewed.  New  terminology is introduced, such as &quot;Black Body,&quot; &quot;Spectral  Energy Distribution,&quot; and &quot;Color Temperature Values.&quot;  Although technical, charts, graphs and short explanations in bold lettering  make the unfamiliar vocabulary less frightening.  Section III is far  more user friendly and takes us where we are eager to go.  &quot;Making the  Theory Work For You&quot; talks about capturing specific subjects on your  infrared film and the best techniques and equipment with which to do this.  The subjects of film differences, lenses, filters, exposure and darkroom  work are discussed in detail.  White also writes about the basic rules of  making a photograph and how--if at all--these elements are affected by  infrared film.  As I said, this book will take some study and  concentration in order to absorb all the complex information.  I'm not sure  so much detail about the physics of light is necessary, but it can't hurt  to have it on hand and it is something that has to be learned and learned  well by anyone wishing to be a competent photographer.  I give this book a  solid **** star rating.r You&quot; talks about capturing specific subjects on your  infrared film and the best techniques and equipment with which to do this.

Every step is  described and illustrated in detail.  You just can't go wrong.  Chapter  one introduces you to the supplies needed and media available for  handcoloring photographs.  How to set up your workplace is discussed as is  how to choose and prepare the photograph you want to color.  Part of the  preparation for the photograph is the correct printing of the photograph,  print size and paper choice.  These considerations are fully discussed.  Then you make your choice of media.  You can choose  oil paints and  pastels, watercolor paints, colored pencils, markers, acrylics or gouache.  Chapter two introduces you to toners and dyes.  &quot;Toning or dyeing can  help you achieve a better handcolored result,&quot; the author suggests.  A  before and after sample print shows the difference sepia-toning a print  before coloring can make.  The results are indeed, pleasing.  Each step of  the toning and dyeing procedures are clearly illustrated and explained.  Again, sample prints illustrate the effect each process has on a print.  Selective toning or dyeing (a method of toning or dyeing only a portion of  a print) is also described.  You are introduced to oil paints,  pastels and other oil-based media in greater detail in chapter three.  How  to choose the medium best for your project and preparing the print for the  particular media you choose is covered.  Again, clear illustrations and  text allow you to follow the artist through the steps taken to handcolor a  specific photograph using each oil-based medium.  Laird and Chambers  take the same care going into detail in chapter four.  This chapter  covers all you need to know to get started using watercolor paint to color  your photographs.  Clear explanations and instructions accompany the  step-by-step illustrations.  Types of watercolor (liquid, tube or cake) are  discussed as are brushes.  Chapter five talks about using colored pencils  and chapter six discusses all other media.  Can you mix the various  media when coloring one print?  You bet.  Examples of such prints are shown  with suggestions and instructions on how to do it in chapter seven.  Chapter eight ties all the loose ends together, and answers any questions  you still may have before tackling your project.  Chapter nine is a  quick course in color theory, mixing pigments and choosing the best colors  for your particular photograph. The last chapter tells us how to finish the  print and prepare it for showing.  Subjects such as spray finishes,  matting, framing and displaying your print and archival considerations are  covered.  Appendix A lists manufacturers and suppliers for the  various products needed for handcoloring photographs.  Appendix B follows  with a guide to the advantages and disadvantages of the different coloring  media.  A glossary and index end the book.  I found this book  thorough, clear and complete.

If given any of  the assignments listed, would you know how to go about lighting the  subjects correctly and effectively?  Lighting--especially of reflective  surfaces--can be tricky.  The proper lighting of a surface or subject can a  take  dull, boring subject and turn it into a prize winning illustration.  Proper lighting on your models can turn a so-so portrait into a dramatic  statement.  Lighting is important, understanding how to use it correctly  can make or break your career.  I used to think experience,  experimentation and a good eye could lead the way to properly lighting a  scene or subject.  That doesn't always work, however.  If you don't know  how you got the perfect lighting on your subject, you won't know how to  duplicate it if you want that lighting for another subject.  You have to  know the rules.  Creative Lighting Techniques for Studio Photographers  explains lighting in clear language and then demonstrates the various  techniques with large, clean illustrations.  The photographer's vocabulary  of lighting terminology is explained and illustrated with equal  proficiency.  After reading this volume, you will know what specular  lighting, edge transfers, diffused values, obstruction distance and  separation lighting are.  You will understand distant relationships  of light to subject and main light to distance (to subject) to ambient  ratios.  Better than that you will know why and how light works, falls off,  changes energy and reflects and how these elements effect your images.  Any questions you may have after reading the text and studying the  illustrations will probably be answered in the &quot;`Tips' boxes.&quot;  &quot;Tech Tips&quot; feature additional technical information to help you  apply the techniques discussed in the chapter's text.  &quot;Quick  Reminder&quot; boxes repeat important terms and concepts introduced in each  chapter.  &quot;Did You Know?&quot; boxes feature even more helpful  information concerning the use of techniques just learned.  &quot;Data for  Frames&quot; boxes tell all about the technical specifications of the  images, and includes exposure information, camera, lens and film data.  To illustrate the thoroughness of the chapters in this book, I will use the  portion &quot;Light Painting 101,&quot; from Section Three.  The term,  &quot;light Painting&quot; is explained; the reader is then referred to a  previous page where light painting is being used by a photographer for a  commercial shot.  Three schematics of the set up are shown, along eight  with illustrative photographs.

Measuring only 6 1/4 X 6 1/4&quot; with 72 pages, this book holds images of tiny feet in sweet,  scuffed, muddy and precious baby shoes of all kinds. Above the shoes are  chubby knees, drooping socks and rolled up cuffs of baggy pants or  appealing hems of pretty little dresses. Some shoe laces are untied. Some  feet are moving--running jumping, swinging and more, and some are still.<br />Some images are black and white, some are brown-toned and others are  color. All are captivating. What a wonderful idea photographer Marina  Drasnin Gilboa had when she thought of producing this book. This book would  be a precious gift for a new parent or grandparent. Totally delightful.

I had quite a different experience reading Photo Retouching with Adobe Photoshop.  This book is very well written. It makes Adobe Photoshop easy for even a  beginner like me. I followed the directions for a couple of the tasks  explained in this book and had no problem getting the results I wanted.  Chapters cover topics from &quot;a Historical Perspective&quot; of photo  retouching to marketing your work. Lute explains computer terms, such as  plug-ins, hard drives, RAM, and external hard drives. Suggestions for  buying a computer are offered along with what hardware and software may be  best for your purposes. Capturing the digital image is discussed as are  scanning techniques.  Then the fun begins--and I do mean fun. Just learning  Adobe Photoshop myself, I know how frustrating it is to follow directions  when working in Photoshop. After working for hours, getting the effects  wanted in your photograph seems impossible. Not a problem with Photo  Retouching with Adobe Photoshop. Each step is clearly explained and  illustrated. It is impossible to get lost or forget a step if you follow  the script.  For instance, chapter three (&quot;Restoring an Image&quot;)  talks about &quot;Using a Layer as a Mask.&quot; Accompanying the text for  each project are charts, photographs and the list of Adobe Photoshop tools  as they will be seen on your screen is illustrated. The first section tells  the reader how to remove an unwanted object from a picture. Fourteen  easy-to-follow steps take you through the process. Several more projects  are discussed and illustrated and each of the twelve chapters, subjects and  projects are just as thoroughly explained and illustrated. Author and  photographer Gwen Lute is a photo retoucher with over thirty-years of  professional experience. Along with these talents, she lectures to  professional photographers on traditional and digital retouching methods.  Because I actually worked on my own projects following the instructions in  this book, I can say without reservation this is a helpful and valuable  book.photographers on traditional and digital retouching methods.

Ellis, an internationally renowned psychologist and founder of the Albert Ellis Institute for Rational Emotive  Behavior Therapy,  writes like a psychologist--a little too deep for the  layperson.  He also uses initials in his writing.  Whenever you read  &quot;REBT,&quot; you are to remember it stands for Rational Emotive  Behavior Therapy.  &quot;IB&quot; stands for (Irrational Beliefs),  &quot;USA&quot; (unconditional  self-acceptance),  and &quot;UAO&quot;  Unconditional Acceptance of Others.  I found it distracting to be reading a  chapter and having to go back and find for which  &quot;IB,&quot;  REBT,&quot; &quot;UAO,&quot; and all the other initials stood.  About  haf-way through the book, things fell into place, made sense and became  interesting.  I started to understand what Ellis was saying, and the book  became helpful and informative.  His theory is, we are the captain of our  ships--our minds.  No matter what storms we must weather, we have what it  takes to overcome these disturbances and continue our journey with smooth  sailing, under our own power.  On page 49 Ellis says, &quot;. . .you  have little control over many unfortunate Activating Events or Adversities  (A's) that plague you, but you largely can control your Beliefs (B's) about  these Adversities.&quot;  He continues, &quot;You can control and exhange  your own disturbance-creating demands!&quot;  This is the heart of his  therapy.  Ellis relates patient's stories, how they were treated and  how the overcame their problems.  When reading these anecdotes, it gives  the reader a feeling of, I'm not alone with my problems and they can be  overcome.  This is always helpful.  Included in the book is  an REBT  Self-Help Form.  This is a worksheet that allows us to put our problems on  paper, examine them, research them, put them under a microscope and find an  answer to them.  Although a little intimidating at first, this book really  does offer  helpful suggestions if you are willing to stick with it and do  some work.  On the back cover of his book Ellis is described as  controversial, charismatic and innovative.  The answers to life's problems  aren't easy and having someone shake us up a little just might be the push  we need to get ourselves going in the right direction.<br />-End-lly  does offer  helpful suggestions if you are willing to stick with it and do  some work.

You can't be in a field that long and not know what is going on and how to be successful.  In this book, Abraham shares all of what he has learned.  Reading this book  offers a golden opportunity to take advantage of an expert's advice.<br />His  book is full of ideas and information about how you can be more successful  in your business.  He gives examples of big businesses that increased their  profit margins and how they did it, and how you can do the same thing and  get the same results as the big boys.<br />If you have a small business,  however, or are just building your business, you can put Abraham's ideas  and methods to work starting today.  None of the advice is  &quot;Pie-in-the-sky&quot; or difficult.  The ideas are proven  winners.<br />Abraham's approach is consumer oriented--his theory is if you  have happy customers, you will have more business.  This shouldn't be  anything new or suprising, but in today's rough and tumble busines world,  it seems the customer is the last person many businesses think of, yet  there is where your profits are.<br />Each chapter ends with an &quot;Action  Steps&quot; segment.  These are assignments for you to do, and taking the  time to do them will be worthwhile.  The book is easy to understand; it  comes through with what it promises and suggests ways you can go over what  ou already have in assests and opportunities and make more of what you've  got.	2000-03-21

The first thing I noticed about Rebuilding is the feelings that surface during this  trying and stressful period of your life are identified.  When we are  really suffering, it is hard sometimes, to analyze what we are feeling.  Is  it pain?  Depression?  Self-hate?  All of the above?  It is comforting to  read that you learn we are not alone in our pain and confusion and that  given the circumstances, the turmoil you are experiencing is quite normal.  As each emotion is explored, the reasons for them are also examined.  An example from another who has suffered the same misery is given, then the  best part--what we can do with and about those upsetting, hurtful and  sometimes hateful feelings that want to pull us under and drown us.  For example, Chapter 7 looks at the two, &quot; . . . very strong feelings  which accompany the trauma of divorce--guilt and rejection.  Advice given  is to do a self-examination.  Do we need to learn new ways of relating to  people?  Do we realize that feeling rejected is a part of ending any  relationship?  It's normal.  It's natural.  There is nothing wrong with us.  Whew!  If you are the one leaving the relationship, you are probably  feeling guilt.  You don't want to hurt someone you do or did love.  However, say Fisher and Alberti, &quot;To end a love relationship may be  appropriate because it has been destructive for both people.&quot;  Leaving  can be a good thing for both people in the relationship.  The chapter  continues to describe the emotional cycles the &quot;dumpers&quot; (the one  ending the relationship) and the &quot;Dumpee&quot; (the one being  rejected) go through.  Fisher and Alberti acknowledge not everyone is going  to react the same, but no one escapes the pain.  No matter how we are  affected, though, we must remember guilt and rejection are tied to feelings  of self- worth and self-love.  Build up these two areas and we will be less  devastated by life's inevitable rejections.  And how do we go about  building our self-worth.  Chapter 11 tells us how to go about that.  The end of each chapter has a &quot;How Are You Doing?&quot; section.  A  list of questions will help us think our way through our dilemmas and offer  ideas with which we can rebuild our lives.  I like this book because it  forces us to do something besides sitting around feeling sorry for  ourselves.  There are ways to work through relationships that end, and we  have the power and the tools to do it.  We don't have to feel helpless.  I  like this book because it acknowledges we are not alone with our feelings.  There is light at the end of the tunnel.  We can go on to live a normal,  happy life.  It gives us hope.

It is  not just the mundane, &quot;cameras were invented--color film made its  debut in . . . , or Steichen, Adams Avedon were known for . . . ,&quot;  however. A blurb from the book's cover notes, &quot;New York Times  photography critic Vicki Goldberg and art historian Robert Silberman,  senior consultants to the PBS series, show how profoundly photography has  helped shape the life of our nation, examining it in the realms of home  life, advertising, science, news, propaganda, fashion, and celebrity  stardom.&quot;<br />&quot;One of photography's great gifts has always been to  make possible many kinds of vicarious experience,&quot; says the  introduction to an article about National Geographic magazine. Photography  brought foreign peoples and foreign places into our homes. On the other  hand, &quot;Even our worst faults were put before the world's eyes by our  photographers because of the extent of our media industry and the openess  of our press,&quot; say Goldberg and Silberman. These two examples  illustrate the awesome power photography possesses.<br />The first use of  halftone screens and the regular publication of photographs in magazines  and newspapers (1897, The New York Tribune); the first American photo  magazine (Life); the first horrific photographs of war. The image that  showed the stars so clearly that the first catalogue of stellar positions  based on photographic measurements appeared in 1885; images that proved  scientific theories and made social reform possible. Photographs that  showed the world how evil the family of man can be. Images that portray the  wonder and beauty of our world.

A story that is challenging and unconventional, Chantecler! can be a delight to read, or disturbing. It depends on how patient you are as a reader. After reading the book once, I felt the author, Victor Thomas  Salupo, was trying to send too many messages in one story. A blurb on the  back cover by Dr. Glory Van Scott says, \\"Chantecler! is a microcosm of  today's society ...\\" The story is about love, duty, heartbreak, feminism,  betrayal, and more. That is a lot of life to cover in 237 pages.<br />Set in a  barnyard, the story features characters that include a rooster  (Chantecler), a raven, a dog, pigeon and Chantecler's love interest, a  pheasant-hen named Claudine who stole the golden plumage of the male  pheasant and a scarecrow.<br />Reading the book a second time, I was more able  to pick up on all the messages the story contained. After both readings,  however, the story's ending left me wondering.  Chantecler! is not for  everyone, but if you like stories with a philosophical twist that  challenges your mind, it may be the story for you.<br />Marilyn Anita  Dalrymple	1999-12-30

The introduction to the book states, &quot;. . . when photographing landscapes, you are at  the mercy of these elements--quickly changing weather, changing and uneven  illumination, poor contrast or limited tonal range, undesirable yet  unchangeable foregrounds or backgrounds, and extraneous objects in the  scene which may significantly detract from your composition.&quot;  The  challenge of creating a dynamic black and white landscape almost makes a  photographer want to quit before beginning.  Yet, with the help of this  book, obtaining a spectacular black and white landscape seems to be within  the realm of possibility.  I like the book most because there is  great detail in clear and understandable terms.  Along with the text are  more than seventy interpretive examples of black and white landscape  photographs.  The first section of the book discusses &quot;The  Artist's Tools.&quot;  Everything from camera format to film and tripods  are thoroughly addressed, including the benefits or drawbacks of various  choices, prices and recommended accessories.  Section two defines the  art of landscape photography.  Some questions answered are, &quot;What is  art?&quot; &quot;What makes a good landscape photograph?&quot; and  &quot;Why black and White?&quot;  I found section 3 to be the most  informative.  Visual elements are explained in detail.  Among some of the  aspects covered are framing, vision, viewpoint, tonality and design.  &quot;Field Techniques&quot; are explained in section four.  The sometimes  confusing effects of different colored filters on black and white images  are explained with the help of charts and photographic examples.  A  condensed, but comprehensive explanation of the Zone System ends this  section.  The quotation, &quot;The darkroom  . . . allows you to create  an image that exactly matches your artistic conception&quot; introduces  section five. This chapter takes us into the darkroom and beyond.  Section  six explains &quot;Putting it all together,&quot; and section seven gives  examples of field exposure, darkroom printing and Zone System field  exposure records so we can repeat the perfect image every time.

While working in a local drug store, she was  given the duty of processing film in the darkroom.  Fascinated with  photography and an eager student, Welsch was taught the fine art of  printing by a master printer.  As the first female staff photographer  in Boston at the Boston Herald Traveler, she quickly advanced to the Boston  Globe.  Covering the Robert Kennedy funeral, Vietnam War demonstrations and  a papal visit were some of her most challenging assignments.  She completed  a project for National Geographic and collected distinguished awards for  her work as a photojournalist.  Welsch has chosen more than fifty of  her most compelling images to discuss in Stock Photography: Professional  Techniques and Images.  Accompanying each black and white or colored image  is an in-depth discussion by the author explaining settings, composition,  mood and equipment and why and how each element was chosen and used.  I  find her willingness to discuss so deeply and thoroughly her intimate  thoughts of the images and their making, refreshing and helpful.  If you  are a seasoned photographer this book may help you find a new way of seeing  or connecting with your subjects.  If you are a beginner, the insight  Welsch offers is invaluable.  Her revelations concerning her thinking and  reasoning as she shot the image and printed it, is  really a learning  experience for readers.  Dispersed with her disclosures about her  work are facts like how to get started in stock photography, a description  of a photographer's evolution and how to handle necessary technicalities  such as how to get subjects to sign model releases.  Welsch  allows readers to see how the mind of a successful photographer works.  She  is willing to share everything, technically and emotionally, about her  images and the making of them.them.	1999-12-10

It is a breath of fresh air from the  &quot;medical journals&quot; those who have been diagnosed with breast  cancer find themselves reading.<br />Light-hearted, warm, yet informational,  &quot;The Not-so-Scary Breast Cancer Book&quot; does, indeed, make the  diagnosis of breast cancer &quot;Not-so- Scary.&quot;  I would--and  have--recommended this book to recent breast cancer patients who need a  respite from other informational resources that can be too overwhelming,  too cold, too medical. I have every intention of introducing medical  professionals in the field of breast cancer treatment to this  book.<br />Inexpensive and simple ways are suggested for the patient to make  their lives easier, more comfortable, more fun and happier during this very  stressful time; and the book reminds us &quot;This too will pass.&quot;<br />A  definite &quot;must read.&quot;<br />(Marilyn Dalrymple-book reviewer,  photographer, writer and breast cancer survivor.)	1999-10-28
