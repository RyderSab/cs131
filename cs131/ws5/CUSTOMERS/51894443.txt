From Raising Arizona to ... this?<br /><br />Actually, I was raised with the good advice that \\"if you don't have anything nice to say about someone or something then don't say anything at all\\" - advice which I must admit I haven't followed with all that much regularity.<br /><br />But in the case of Dr. Kitei's ... memoir, I will try to make an exception.<br /><br />Currently, there are two books dealing with the fascinating events known as the Phoenix lights.  Neither of them satisfactorily document this series of UFO sightings with sufficient detail or descriptive rigor. However, Mr. Hamilton's The Phoenix Lights Mystery is the superior effort and the only one worth reading.<br /><br />I say this without any animosity towards Lynne Kitei.  Dr. Kitei certainly put a lot of herself into the writing of this book. Unfortunately, way too much to make it interesting for a reader who is primarily curious about discovering whatever it was that did happen in and around Phoenix.	2005-09-18

As long overdue and greatly anticipated as this book was, I regret that I cannot be more appreciative of the end result.<br /><br />Major observations:<br /><br />Granted this is not strictly a biography of a singular person but rather a study of the life and times, focusing on \\"the McDonald years\\" of 1965 to 1971, and its related events.  Nonetheless, even the most devoted reader's attention is soon dulled by what is decidely too much of a good thing.  The density of peripheral persons, committees, case studies, bureaucratic furbelows, trips here, memos there, on and on...<br />Well, you get the picture.  Unfortunately, you begin to lose sight of the man amongst so many less than relevant explanations and elaborations.  I think Ann Druffel suffered from the same obsessive overload that helped contribute to Dr. McDonald's downfall.  If her book was half as long I am certain it would read twice as well.  An editorial job definitely lacking here.<br /><br />Some minor observations:<br /><br />I find the metaphor of Firestorm less than appropriate as a title for this book.  Likewise, the background photo of a forest fire in the cover design will likely lend itself only to confusion for the casually interested potential reader. Again, not the wisest editorial choice.<br /><br />Likewise, I must object to the selection of Dr. Vallee in providing a foreword.  Considering the overuse of his opinions - particularly in constant defense of Dr. Hynek's own trollishness. His presence at the outset of this book seems inapt, to say the least.<br /><br />In any case, I do recommend your reading Firestorm.

Sorry, all you Demonologist wannabes but<br /><br />Jodie can't come out to play.<br /><br />From the outset, let me be clear:<br /><br />Having an open mind and healthy curiosity, I must honestly admit<br /><br />that I have a great deal of interest in and acceptance of a wide<br /><br />range of paranormal phenomena.  But this is not to say I am easily gullible.<br /><br />Dr. Kaplan's book happens to remain the definitive history of<br /><br />what is to every extent a hoax.  That it was a clumsily<br /><br />concocted hoax, there can be no doubt.  That it was a hoax which<br /><br />succeeded so surprisingly well there can be no doubt was due to an even more than usually insipid,<br /><br />lazy and sensationalistic media that cooperated entirely.<br /><br />\\"Journalists\\" who reported gossip almost verbatim in the furtherance of silly season news filler,<br /><br />and interviews that rarely provided even a cursory challenge to credulity were the norm back then.<br /><br />(And what else is new?)<br /><br />This is a dry, detailed and exhaustive documentation of almost<br /><br />every event subsequent to the Lutze/Anson deception which proved so<br /><br />remarkably profitable to all involved.  Prof. Kaplan deserves a<br /><br />great deal of credit for his forebearance and dedication to the truth.<br /><br />There are no cheap frights or pandering in this book, no scares other than in the way reality can<br /><br />be so easily hidden.<br /><br />Red eyed pigs do not haunt its pages.<br /><br />What you will find is a rather twisted, amusing and depressing tale of mendacity,<br /><br />wishful thinking and opportunism.<br /><br />There are some personalities involved in this story who do not bear up very well<br /><br />under the investigative light.<br /><br />It only proves that P.T. Barnum was right about suckers.<br /><br />The saddest part is that it all took such a toll on the investigator.<br /><br />Prof. Kaplan's effort deserves to be appreciated.	2005-04-16

Ann Wroe finds these projections<br />interesting, but you may not.

Tolkien.<br />And from amongst an overwhelmingly creative and prolific<br />output of novels this Chanur series is, to my mind and<br />taste, her finest and most impressive achievement.<br />It is difficult to describe how thoroughly and yet how<br />effortlessly Cherryh evokes her alien races; their<br />psychological, mercantile and poltical twists and turns,<br />so subtle, so compelling and fascinatingly mature, woven<br />into plots that are both intriguing and fast-paced.<br />In other words: C.J. Cherryh offers the sophisticated<br />reader everything that Star Wars and Star Trek and all the<br />other rip-off drivel ought to be but rarely are!<br />Yes, she does make the reader work to get acclimated<br />to the complexities of this strange yet familiar universe,<br />but that effort pays off because her storytelling skills<br />are so full-bodied - with plenty of good, old-fashioned<br />space-opera action to boot!<br />The only drawback to this republication is that it omits the<br />first volume, The Pride of Chanur, (Chanur's Legacy is a follow-<br />up though not expressly a sequel), even though it has the<br />original cover to Pride (which is the poorest of Michael<br />Whelan's otherwise superb four!).

Nothing else quite like it since its original publication over 20 years ago.<br /><br />* As of 2013, I notice several other books have been published concerning this topic.  Unfamiliar with their content, so unable to comment on their quality.<br /><br />Though it begins with, and is occasionally bogged down by some typically tiresome academic prose, for the most part Hufford has the courage to allow the facts - meaning testimonies - to speak for themselves. With the benefit of his methodical and objective reasoning, this approach eventually delivers his subject from the tediousness of too much jargon and equivocation.<br /><br />And though he wisely resists arriving at any certain conclusions, his courage to at least acknowledge most of the possible explanations - physio/psychological or supernatural - associated with pavor nocturnus is much to his credit.<br /><br />Many of the eyewitness accounts (which, I think, could have been improved by some editing), actually make for rather scary and unnerving late night reading.  If you are familiar with the lackluster Grave's End, you will know what I mean. Likewise, similar examples of such \\"entity\\" encounters can be found in numerous other allegedly true haunting accounts. The resemblances and similarities are remarkable and, I submit, establish a pattern of credibility rather than imitation. T<br /><br />I only wish that the Professor had more thoroughly described the different stages of sleep, including brain wave Hz rates, length and periodicity of cycles and degress of REM activity. It seems to me that an all inclusive scientific study of nightmares should result in some truly surprising insights into the nature of consiousness itself. At the very least a more complete and rigorous background explanation of what we currently understand about sleep would do much to bolster the bona fides of this specific inquiry.<br /><br />Likewise, Professor Hufford is way overdue for an update considering the limited sources his research was conducted from and based upon. Considering the fact that he has pioneered this topic, his further investigations ought to be of even greater value and objectivity.<br /><br />* I have found at least one somewhat decent documentary about Night Hag/Shadow People, from @ 2008 which includes Hufford's comments. It is available on YouTube.  He wisely maintains an objective, agnostic opinion, though does not indicate whether or not he is still involved in research.<br /><br />Regarding the entity hypothesis - which I obviously find the most reasonable (yes, that's the right word!), allow me to recommend a perusal of Carlos Castaneda's The Active Side of Infinity, particularly the chapters on Inorganic Awareness and Mud Shadows.<br /><br />Skeptical? Just take a look, you'll see what I mean.<br />Not necessarily THE explanation, but there certainly are many interesting correlations!br />Likewise, Professor Hufford is way overdue for an update considering the limited sources his research was conducted from and based upon.

I must admit that his final,<br />summarizing chapter actually brought a tear to my eye - hardly<br />to be expected from a book on geology and regional history<br />mixed with, amongst other topics, some anthropology.<br />In other words this book has enough of everything to satisfy<br />every curiosity you might have about those tumbled down rows<br />of stones found in just about every New England forest and<br />suburb.

Make<br />sure you order the Revised And Updated version from 2003.<br />Carr provides much useful information and perspective on the<br />murderous effect that war has always had on &quot;noncombatants&quot;.<br />Writing clearly (if rather dryly) he describes how such massacres - intentional or otherwise -<br />have effected the evolution not only of warfare's goals but of mankind's concept<br />of how to define and therefore somehow limit what war actually is.<br />I found Caleb Carr's effort here extremely valuable.  He provides<br />much perspective.  It would be petty to gnaw and nit-pick over some of the specific examples<br />Carr utilizes in advancing his basic idea.  Carr has enough dash to make sure he instigates<br />both left and right on his way to the finale--good for him.<br />You will find some of those ideologues fuming in earlier reviews.<br />Carr displays clear-eyed common sense in his analysis of war's<br />lack of distinction between soldier and civilian in its consequences and even its strategies.<br />His comparison of terrorism with slavery and piracy were alone worth the time spent reading.<br />This is a short read but a most worthwhile one.  Make up your own mind - just look over the introduction.  Carr's objectivity and knowledge of military history will provide you with a valuable and useful primer on the nature of terrorism and how<br />it relates to war's human nature.  He does not offer any convenient explanations or easy solution.  I look forward to hearing more from him on this topic.	2003-09-07

This is a shame because the basic idea,<br />setting, characters and themes had so much potential.<br />Frank could also have availed us a small glossary<br />for all those Spanish/South American titles and terms he constantly used here.<br />Obviously his pot had boiled over in the middle 60's,<br />with so many projects cooking - not to mention the<br />incomparable Dune and its still nascent sequel.<br />Nonetheless,in the hands of a decent film script writer<br />(or is that an oxymoron?)<br />an updated and more fully developed version of this story's plot and characters would make a very interesting, intelligent and exciting science fiction movie...<br />Something rarely ever accomplished.

Much better cover on this revised edition then the Edward<br />Gorey illustration on original hardcover.<br />Simply one of the best cultural reviews of movie horror ever<br />written.  The chapter on Fifties' drive-in horror alone is<br />worth the cost of the book.  Loads of documentary information,<br />intelligent commentary, trenchant insights.  The only drawback,<br />as others have mentioned, is David J. Skal's habit of leaning<br />a little too heavily on certain prejudices or opinions in order<br />to make a theory or speculation of his fit a little more neatly<br />then it otherwise would have. Mr. Skal, your &quot;post modernist&quot;<br />academic roots are showing! (Though this stealth editorializing does not intrude too much in The Monster Show, it truly gives<br />you the creeps while struggling through much of his Screams Of Reason.)<br />Anyway, this book is a MUST for anyone devoted to American history, horror trivia, cultural pathology --<br />all that cool stuff and much, much more!  Nicely researched and<br />written, a great reference and resource for the Crypt Keeper-<br />Monster Mash kiddies out there (like me).  If you know what I mean, you ought to own this book.	2002-07-13

Let's hope<br />that enough of the right people have read this account<br />as we hunt down the dispicable Duh-Sama cult and the rest<br />of their nameless ilk.<br />Nearly perfect in its depiction of the minute-to-minute<br />details of this horror-show our men found themselves<br />trapped in for most of a day.  The only criticism I have<br />about Mr. Bowden's reconstruction:<br />1. Should have had more maps, and all should have compass<br />bearings, indications of distance.<br />2. Every chapter and episode ought to have started with an<br />hour/minute of action, to better keep track of the progress<br />of events.<br />3. An alphabetical list of all the combatants likewise would<br />have been convenient and helpful in reducing some of the confusion.<br />4. Mr. Bowden seemed to shy away from criticizing Clinton and<br />those other officials who were, in one respect or another,<br />responsible for this slaughter.  His afterword should have<br />dwelled on this aspect of the story more than it did.<br />Otherwise, one of the finest books I have read in several years.<br />A tribute to the brave Americans who fought and bled and would<br />have otherwise been so unfairly forgotten.	2001-10-01

Do not expect anything like a resolution to the events of  StarTide Rising here.  Brilliant, up-to-date space opera that unfortunately suffers from the Too Much Of A Good Thing syndrome that has bedeviled an awful lot of SF since Frank Herbert set the  sequel-itis meme loose big time.  In other words: bloat. Heaven's Reach would have benefitted more by including less -- less of repetition, less of dizzying detail, less of all that impressive multi-dimensional, multi-species, multi-incident &quot;dross&quot; that only frustrates the story's impetus and, sadly, obscures our interest in its characters.  This novel is a mind-boggler, no doubt about that. Chock full of wonderful, awesome, cosmic ideas.  But...get ready for the NEXT Uplift trilogy, no doubt cooking on Mr. Brin's already overheated word processor right now. And let's hope for the best from the rest!	2001-07-18

Special tribute to Mr. Dolan for his  many references and credit to two of the finest Americans who have yet to delve into this mystery:  Major Donald Keyhoe and Dr. James E. McDonald.<br />Mr. Dolan's perspective on how a better understanding of UFOs has been obfuscated and frustrated by agencies within our government, as well as much of our national media, conjoined of course, is presented efficiently and without distortion or cant. His summary of 25 years' worth of global UFO sightings alone makes this a valuable reference book. Combined with other developments related to the elaboration of our national security apparatus - domestic and international - this study achieves truly authoritative status. This is a book that every student of American history should read, regardless of their opinion about UFOs.<br />If you have any real interest in this subject this book should be on your list.  Deserves a place alongside the too long out of print UFO Controversy In America by Prof. David M. Jacobs.<br />Cannot wait for volume #2!	2001-06-09

There can be no doubt that the maestro was a magnificent talker: frank, witty, engaging, poetic.... Need I go on? Truly blessed with the gift of gab - amongst so many other talents, in fact, the way in which he chatted up his films was, at times, more entertaining than watching some of them.<br />Fellini was a marvelous, uniquely fascinating character, all this is clear from reading these fragmentary interviews.  Unfortunately, what is sorely lacking from the questions Constantini asks is what most readers would primarily want to discover in reading this book.  Yes the incidentals of his life are important, and interesting, and necessary.  Yes the anecdotes about Mastroianni and Eckberg and so on are amusing.  But what about the hows of his approach, the whys of his style? There is just too much missing here to really make it worth our while.  Federico Fellini the filmmaker is actually under-represented!<br />Though he probably would not have answered those sorts of questions all that directly we would still learn a little more about, for example, why Fellini always liked to loop his dialog in such an offbeat way, or why he chose to dolly and pan through his scenes so busily, or how he came to prefer so peculiar a rhythmn to his editing.  THESE are the kinds of questions I think any real admirer of his work would love to try teasing answers from him about. Too little about the way of the art, too much about the way of the career.<br />The maestro deserves better -- and got it!  Read I, FELLINI instead.  On the plus side, though: nice cover, excellent font and print size on good quality paper with some decent pictures.	2001-05-27

This book deserves to be read by EVERYONE who professes a true interest in the Global Warming Hypothesis.  Yes, that's right, that currently popular THEORY which has been so generally and uncritically accepted that most any contradiction of  its dogmas is automatically branded environmental apostasy and corporate sell-out! These two gentlemen have provided us with a welcome antidote to the low-level hysteria usually associated with the currently fashionable model of global climate change, its unctuous hand-wringing and DISASTER-batory self-righteousness.  I only wish they had spent more time with detailing a perspective of the interglacial period we now occupy, particularly of modern science's inadequate understanding  of glacial periodicity and the shorter variations of climate that have interspersed those warming and cooling cycles.  Contemporary thought is ALWAYS far too blind to anything but the narrow parameters of, at most, two or three generations worth of change. Real scientific progress requires such rigor: empirical objectivity, free of bias and prejudgement. The Satanic Gases contributes in its own small way towards that better progress. No, it does not have all the answers, nor is it simply intended as a debunk of &quot;mainstream&quot; consensus.  What you will find here are some alternative explanations to many of the half-truths being fobbed off by the mass media as geophysical and atmospheric fact.  A most excellent and worthwhile place to start, if you care at all for the truth.	2001-02-11

Very knowledgeable, assured - and witty - conclusions about the genesis of general-use operating system GUIs.  The author of the impressive SF novel THE DIAMOND AGE employs his engagingly conversational style to explain why he thinks the design of computer interfaces has divorced users from a true use, understanding and appreciation of such devices.  Is the predominance of the graphical interface symptomatic of our  general laziness, or part of our salvation from creeping technocracy?  There is much that is uncontestably true about this thesis, and even more truth to the related commentary concerning the state and direction of personal computing - and of modern society.  Yet, I could not help feeling,  by the end of this essay, that Stephenson actually left the central question begging: Why precisely does it matter whether computers provide everyone with control over their functionality? Though I hardly qualify as a &quot;power user&quot;, my own personal inclination is towards that degree of freedom: to be able to get under the hood and choose how I want my equipment to perform without having it dictated to me.  This is something that is still much too complicated and tiresome  for most people to bother with - a point which, of couse, Stephenson makes repeatedly.  Unfortunately, he does not sufficently delineate the reasons for our need to aspire to this degree of expertise.  Yet another example of a programmer's priestly attitude towards those pesky end users, perhaps? Likewise, Stephenson's ambivalence towards Microsoft as a monopoly, while admirably idiosyncratic, seemed almost cavalier in its disregard for the history of a company that has flaunted its predatory arrogance - and still does.  That is the reality the poor Nells of user-dom have to contend with.  Simply reduced, his argument seems to be MS ain't a monopoly because I don't think so, and anyway someone else would have been just as bad so what difference does it make? But read Command Line for yourself and see what you think. I guarantee that it will make the time fly by, give you a chuckle or two - and much to think over.  And it sure beats a trip to DisneyWorld.... For now.f and see what you think. I guarantee that it will make the time fly by, give you a chuckle or two - and much to think over.

Sequeing towards...what?  One suspects that the eventual  outcome of this storyline will converge/intertwine with the Sprawl trilogy.  Gibson is brilliant enough to pull that off with his usual multithreading prose.  I for one am grateful  to be along for the ride.  Parties reveals even greater refinement in characterization, plotting, description.  Gibson continues to cut to the bone in his story telling, honing his ability to state many things with astonishing ease and almost deceptive elegance.  One is constantly compelled to re-read passages both for truth of meaning and beauty of construction.  Take advantage of this marvelous author while the origami-like meta-novel he seems to be constructing for us continues to unfold.	2001-01-19

Mr Chariton's research seems to have surpassed his ability to compile and  present it in an entirely satisfactory way.In respect to the presentation  of the sequence of sightings, particularly in Texas - the focus of this  work, a more methodical format would have worked better. I think a  chronology of sightings with respective maps would have helped a great deal  in communicating just how peculiar these sightings were, and how they  played out and fit together withinthe few months of 1897.Likewise, I found  myself wondering more about how previous newspaper accounts were likely to  have influenced later sightings - something the author makes mention of  with less than adequate thoroughness.Thus, my central criticism:obvious  dedication to ALL facets of this truly important and underevaluated series  of UFO sightings, somehow hamstrung in its presentation (publisher's fault,  perhaps?) by an over-reliance on anecdotal information.  I wound up wishing  that Mr. Chariton had spent more time thinking through everything he had  gathered together about the airships before finally deciding what to  write.In any case, he deserves praise and respect for avery decent and  worthwhileattempt at so obscure a subject.One final suggestion:Has anyone  attempted to search for any mysterious explosions that might have occured  soon after these sightings? If there really was a mysterious inventor named  Wilson in NY or Iowa or wherever, perhaps his lab was destroyed in an  accident that might have been recorded subsequently.	2000-07-19

Sly, randy, and splendidly researched, Harvey Jacob's novel is one for the ages.I did not expect this story to be told with so much humor or such understated insight into what our country - and many of its denizens - was  like circa 1869.  Marvelous descriptions, amusingly deft characterizations,  some startlingly intuitive depths where one would least expect them to  appear.  This novel does not at all suffer to compare with the magnificent  RAGTIME.  I was most amused and impressed by the fast, witty dialogue,  particularly between Barnum and Tom Thumb - what used to be called  &quot;crackling good&quot; dialogue during the old screwball comedy days.  Other scenes reminded me of the logical nonsense of CATCH 22.  In other  words:a hoot and a real pleasure to read - made me want to start it all  over again once I finished. Harvey Jacob's marvelous imagination and talent  has provided us with a celebration of American craziness and craftiness.  Very funny and something else. So read it, already!	2000-07-13

A difficult novel to categorize - even harder to describe accurately without spoiling its effect for the prospective reader. Impressively depicts a time and place and, most importantly, the people who  settled New England.  Very few stories can compare: The Scarlet Letter, The  Crucible, come to mind.  Strange and hypnotic, bordering on a metaphysical  tale -- this mystery has more to do with tormented hearts and hungers of  the soul than with the solving of a tragic murder.  And Mr. Begiebing  almost makes it work completely...but not quite.Somehow there was something  lacking in the last section, some shift of emphasis away from the central  story and its characters' dilemma that left me wanting.  Perhaps a  re-reading will change my opinion.  Undoubtedly there is much splendid  writing here, the kind you pause to savor a couple more times before  proceeding with the story.  And the story itself, for the majority of its  length, fascinates: the true mystery here belonging to the motives of men  and women of faith - or its lacking - in the unfathomable wilderness of  17th century New England.  Unfathomable landscapes without and within.  Mr.  Begiebing draws you into America's antique soul to reveal its present day  shadows.  A splendid book that deserves many readers!	2000-02-15

Avoid this book if you have any affection for the movie. Except for the last couple of pages, the author has little to offer other than the usual drivel about &quot;Post-Modernism&quot;. You will be much  better off buying the Director's Cut on DVD, and watching it several  times!  This series of books has its exceptions, this is not one of them.  Unintentionally hilarious in parts, as only the academician can be.  Pretentious, ponderous cinema-scholar jargon that offers little of value or  insight.

Yet, I must offer a somewhat askew opinion of all four parts of Mr. Wolfe's magnificent series:  There is much meandering and often seemingly parenthetical material to these episodes of Severian.  Some  of them are less than successfully interesting, others seem deliberately  obtuse.  Yes, Mr. Wolfe can illuminate by misdirection; but sometimes that  misdirection is a distraction.  In any case, after having read the entire  series of four installments or movements - as you prefer to consider them -  three times,I must confess that the Sword of The Lictor is, to my mind,  perfect.  Would that the other three shared the same wealth of plain  old-fashioned narrative drive!  Superb as the inventiveness, the brilliance  of language and writing and overall ambiance of this masterpiece is, there  are numerous tiresome stretches. Wolfe's virtue sometimes results in his  only vice worth mentioning: over complicated indefiniteness -- he just  hates resolution.  This poetic openness of style, this opacity that makes  New Sun so dreamlike, also can result in an aggravating diffuseness of  meaning, as if he is afraid of limiting the story's scope or its resonance  -- little chance of that though there is!  Which brings me to that fith  installment: Urth of The New Sun is the best example of over- mythopoeia,  if that is the right word, I have ever seen (until Hyperion). After reading  the fourth installment, Citadel of the Autarch, to discover its beautiful  but unresolved finale to this long, long journey, I wanted to throw the  book against the wall.  In fact, I think I did (18 years ago).  But after  Urth, I vowed never again to let Mr. Wolfe take me on any more quests, or  whatever it was!  Of course, now I am planning to read The Litany of the  Long Sun, so there is hope for me yet. Anyway, be prepared for wonder and  beauty and deep, deep imagination...but at a price!	2000-01-06

The title misleads.Anyone expecting a murder mystery or  psychological thriller in an historical setting (which I did not) will be  disappointed.PERFUME is more fable than novel, and thereby would have  benefitted from  more judicious editing.  There is a great deal of detail -  yes, often exquisitely written and lovely in and of itself - which burdens  the pace of the story.  I found the middle section unnecessarily lengthy  and redundant - though, of course, the ending more than made up for  it.There is a great deal of impressive detail concerning period: place,  manner, and most of all the production of perfumes, soaps, etc.....though  often this wealth of prose tends to burden the flow of the story. Fables  are by their nature basic, spare; magic simplicity is their form and their  appeal.  Here content and form do not always agree. A beautiful nightmare.  Original and memorable? Definitely.  A masterpiece of fiction?  Almost. (As  a footnote, it would have been interesting to see what Kubrick - who was  rumored to have been interested in adapting PERFUME - would have done with  the story, how he might have reshaped it. Improved it, maybe?... Probably  not, considering EYES)	1999-11-24
