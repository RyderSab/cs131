I truly loved this  3rd Harry Potter book and thought it astounding, as good as or better than  the first two volumes. But knowing a key element of the outcome knocked out  some of the punch. The New York Review might be for thinking people, but in  this case it sure seemed dumb.	2000-03-01

My daughter, who is 4, said it's a really, really funny book. I personally love the large format of the hardback  edition, because the foldout ladder after all has to be very big, to reach  the moon.	2000-01-25

It's a little dated, but retains its  wonderful capacity to evoke a time and place filled with the sights,  scents, and sounds of stone masons, oil presses, village fetes, kitchen  knives, bursting gardens, market days, voluble peasants, and one  indomitable Fiat.	1999-10-26

Even today, some 90 years  after this book was written, I can still hear the voice of character Old  Man Matthews speaking as if through my 70-year old father-in-law, who was  raised in the Ozarks. Reading the book, I can hear the rain water dripping  from the mountains leaves, the terror of horse hooves pounding the hill  trails at night, the whisperings of the wind through the pines. It's moody,  beautiful, frightening, and full of splendor, all at once.	1999-10-19

It's set in Hawaii in the 1850's, during a time when pressure from foreign powers created considerable turmoil within the Hawaiian royal house. What I like  best is that the story is told in the person of a Hawaiian priest (and  tutor to the Prince Liholiho). He has considerable, intricate, and savy  knowledge of what goes on in Hawaii. Yet he too, like the powerful royal  house he serves, is subject to political and cutural changes far beyond his  control. The descriptions of the influenza and smallpox epidemics, and the  manifestations of the rapidly vanishing old culture, are chilling.	1999-10-19

But I would also like to add that what I actually enjoyed most was the author's keen observations about the Ozark  people -- shrewdly funny. I married a Missourian with roots in the Ozarks,  and having spent some time there now, I can hear their words, their voices,  their sense of humor, and their stories, through Ms. Hubbell's own voice.  (In fact, I find it almost hard to believe that I'm not actually listening  to my husband's relatives at their social gatherings!)	1999-10-14

It is well-written, lively, and most readable; but it is also terribly  romanticized, Damien IS saintly. Perhaps he was. Readers should take minor  note that the main text was published originally in 1937 (according to an  older edition of this book that I own).	1999-10-04

Although I'm a pretty proficient cook,, I've never had much success trying Chinese dishes before. The difficulty I'd had  with some of the other well-known Chinese cookbooks is that they are too  complicated if you've never cooked with some of the ingredients before --  too many variables for the novice. This book takes a somewhat simpler, yet  satisfying approach. It doesn't lack interest. I think I'll learn a great  deal from it.	1999-09-22

If you enjoy the Betty Crocker series of cookbooks, this is right in there with the best. Highly doable home-cooking, with elegance and imagination. I enjoy the photos. I somewhat wish there were more main-dish recipes, as the  ones presented are in one slim chapter. Also, this is a very hefty book and  doesn't open as flat as the spiral bound hardcovers in some of the other  Betty Crocker volumes.

The author is a lady with drive, passion, love, character, and tremendous guts. I read the book cover to cover at one sitting, it's that kind of story. When she found herself on the brink of welfare following a  divorce, she proudly and energetically bootstrapped her own muffin  business, selling door-to-door with her wares in a red wagon. Selling  without a business license, she got into a few scraps, but  characteristically held her head high and....hey, buy the book. It's worth  it.

Apparently the eyepatch is an essential part of the definition of  &quot;pirate&quot; in a youngster's iconic vocabulary. He doesn't look much  like a pirate to me, either.

It's about the people, the hills, and the lifestyle -- all intertwined inseparably from the food. There's  something rich going on here -- and I don't mean in dollars. The author's  done a fine job. The recipes presented are not abundant (the first recipe  doesn't appear until page 103), but they are as &quot;American&quot; as you  can imagine, if not exactly contemporary. Included are country recipes with  names that will intrigue many of us now: elderberry wine, pot likker  dumplings, Cherokee hominy, Blue Ridge fried corn, cherrylog scuppernong  pie, sorghum taffy, and mule ears.

Its approach is definitely New England regional, which  shouldn't be a deterrent to anyone interested in good cooking. There's one  thing that bothers me, and that is the book is not printed on quality paper  -- it looks more like the stuff used in cheap paperback editions, rather  than a hardcover book.

Photographs  are gorgeous, and the stories about the people make you feel rooted to the  land. One of the more intriguing stories is the &quot;Hanging  Elephant&quot; quilt, which shows an applique block of an elephant being  hung for the crime of killing a Tennessee man in 1916. The book is printed  on heavy, high quality paper. Quilt history buffs and anthropologists will  love this book.

Pictures are all  black &amp; white, and instructions for making the quilts are pretty  minimal.

It's not a how-to book for hobbyists, nor is its history  highly accurate if you want the &quot;real&quot; scoop on quilting.

I was intrigued to discover that Marie Webster's designs, introduced to the public as early as 1912, were the originals from which  &quot;traditional&quot; quilt patterns of the 1920's and 1930's were  derived. These include the sunbonnets (gentle here, not saccharine), the  poppy applique, and the medallion floral appliques. Also, it was an  eye-opener to see Webster's dogwood and sunflower designs, extremely close  variants of which were popularized years later by a manufacturer of quilt  batting. The photography is excellent, and the book is printed on beautiful  heavy-stock paper. The essays (written by Webster's grand-daughter) are  joyful and respectful and a pleasure to read. The book includes patterns  for 12 of the quilts shown. I can hardly wait to get started with my  needle.	1999-06-05

You have to be comfortable drafting your own blocks to size from the small-scale ones  shown in the book. The format may seem old-fashioned in comparison to the  very glossy quilt books that have proliferated of late, but I find this  book immensely suggestive and turn to it time and again.	1999-06-04

The photos are great. What's intriguing is the author's theme of how the quilts of the American depression were often anything but somber -- there was great beauty, joy,  and exuberance in the designs.	1999-06-04

Hopkirk researches and traces the sources and inspirations for many of the characters and places in Kim. I confess that  when I started to read Hopkirk's book, I was fearful lest it spoil Kim's  magic. But I found the very opposite to be the case. The more I read  Hopkirk's book, the more Kim grew in richness, depth, and life, and the  more I felt awe for Kipling's masterpiece.	1999-06-04

The author manages to de-mythify the popular notions about Leonardo, while at the same time showing great sensitivity  and respect to his subject.	1999-06-02

Watch out for small applique pieces. The individual flower designs seem to me to work better than the larger composition pieces shown, but all in all a  refreshing new look.	1999-06-02

This book is really a fine example from those years, and both it and its author deserve to be better known.  The pace of the writing is unhurried, self-assured, and the sense of time,  and place, is breathtaking. The setting is a Buddhist temple in a small  town, and the illicit relationship between the priest and his domineering  mother-in-law. By the time you finish reading it, you feel you know the  people and the town like an insider. I feel like I can see the temple and  feel the hush enclosed by its wooden floors and halls. If you've ever been  to Japan and visited a temple, you'll recognize the feeling, and this book  captures it as well as any I know.	1999-04-08

The author covers a great deal of ground in the  novel and at times I found descriptions (of utterly fascinating events)  rather superficial.	1999-04-08

Emotionally it goes straight to your heart without asking too much of you. I enjoyed it, but it doesn't inspire me to read any of the author's  other books.	1999-04-08
