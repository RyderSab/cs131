A Beginner's Guide to Changing the World is an amazing book.  <br /> <br />Ostensibly a book about a woman (author Isabel Losada) who decides to do something to help the people of Tibet (the Chinese should be ashamed of themselves for what they've done to that peaceful country!), A Beginner's Guide is a book for anyone who longs to LIVE life to its fullest. It's a book for people who yearn for adventures, yet never take the first step toward making them happen. <br /> <br />It isn't just for people interested in Buddhism, either. It's a fun-to-read, inspiring book that anyone, of any religious faith, could embrace and enjoy. <br /> <br />Written in a breezy conversational style, A Beginner's Guide is a tale told wonderfully and joyfully. It recounts Ms. Losada's adventures in Tibet, revealing a side to that country's people the Chinese don't usually let people see. If you'd like to see Tibet, but don't have the time or money (or government permission) to go there, A Beginner's Guide to Changing the World is the next best thing. <br /> <br />I wholeheartedly embrace Ms. Losada's desire to help the people of Tibet. I think what happened (and is happening) in that country is just as terrible as anything that happened to the Jews in Nazi Germany. A Beginner's Guide to Changing the World is one woman's attempt to come to grips with the enormity of the situation and to do something about it. (And you'll never believe what kind of things she dreams up to do about it!) <br /> <br />But, again, this book is not heavy-handed or dire. This is one of the most joyful and positive books I've come across in a long time. <br /> <br />I strongly recommend Isabel Losada's book A Beginner's Guide to Changing the World.	2005-08-30

In the movie \\"You've Got Mail\\" Tom Hanks' character (Joe Fox, F-O-X) said, \\"The Godfather is the I Ching. The Godfather is the sum of all wisdom. The Godfather is the answer to any question.\\"    The Godfather won't help us in this case because what I see happening in these Amazon reviews is straight out of Cool Hand Luke: \\"What we have here is a failure to communicate.\\"    By and large, those who have concerns about Velvet Elvis are quoting Rob's book and drawing from some theological or intellectual background to make their point, while those who support his book are drawing from personal experience with Rob Bell and/or Mars Hill to make theirs. The two sides are not even speaking the same language.    That paragraph was a generalization. I realize that. But for the purposes of making sense of these disparate reviews, I hope you will forgive my liberties.    I'm not quite sure I understand Chris Ostrander's review. I don't think anyone wrote/implied/meant Christianity's Jewish roots were unimportant or unknown. I think the reviewer said clearly that Christians already know where our faith came from, but aren't sure why that keeps coming up in reviews supporting the book.    I'm also not sure where Mike Sheridan is coming from. Reviews (pro and con) for Rob Bell's book stretch all the way back to July 14th. The book has been available in local (Grand Rapids) book stores for a couple of weeks now. I imagine many, many books have been sold (and passed from person to person) since it was put on the shelf. So I don't see why it's necessary to claim anyone's trying to \\"take Rob down.\\"    Mike shared his testimony, which I wholeheartedly applaud and congratulate him for. He wrote, \\"I thought I could never come back to a religion that was full of mean, arrogant, people.\\" Yet his tone and attitude was one of the meanest, most arrogant I've read to date. Mike, I'm sorry you don't like or agree with those who take issue with Rob's book. But you really shouldn't treat them with such contempt. The veracity of those who wrote the five star reviews isn't called into question. So why single out those who disagreed with Rob's book?    To be honest, I don't particularly agree with Rob's approach to Christianity. I think his theology is sketchy and his metaphors are stretched to the breaking point. But I marvel at his ability to market himself, his Noomas and Mars Hill. He has a delightfully engaging personality and is seemingly sincere when he speaks. However, one of the reasons why Velvet Elvis worries me is because those who angrily defend Rob's book seem to be missing the point of Rob's book. It's almost as if they're not really reading it. Rob's not preaching anger and hate and bitterness! Haven't you seen his Noomas? They're very emotional and compassionate.    This is the \\"failure to communicate\\" thing I mentioned earlier. There are a whole lot of disconnects happening here -- between those who like and dislike his book, and even within those who like his book but voice their opinions with venom. Messages are not getting through (or understood) for some reason.    I think there's a place in the world for Rob Bell. He speaks to those who seem to have nothing and need something. If Rob's book is able to soothe the hearts of those who are hurting, then I say pray for him and encourage him. Who knows what God can use? If good can come out of Velvet Elvis and Noomas, and people truly find a genuine relationship with Jesus (and a corresponding depth of knowledge of the Bible) then I say more power to Rob Bell.    However, I also think those who highly praise Velvet Elvis need to see where those who have concerns about Velvet Elvis are coming from. Their points are valid. They can't just be ignored -- or spoken to with contempt. People who think Velvet Elvis is wonderful from cover to cover have to accept the fact that Rob's approach to theology is not the norm and that people have concerns about it. Furthermore, I'd go so far as to say that Rob may not be correct in his thinking. That's a possibility, too. Just as it's a possibility that those who have concerns about Velvet Elvis could be wrong.    Each side should strive to understand the other side, and in so doing treat that \\"opposing\\" side with compassion and respect.    Above all, though, for Rob's sake, please don't write such venomous reviews in defense of Velvet Elvis! Such reviews only add credibility to the concerns of those who wrote the one star reviews. And, while everyone is at it, why not pray for enlightenment regarding those one star reviews?     Maybe there's truth to some of those comments that passion for and loyalty to Rob Bell have obscured.    Who knows? I certainly don't.	2005-08-03
US	51344109	R2KH9F25QRHRVG	0439784549	162568542	Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Book 6)	Books	4	8	11	N	Y	Meatier, faster moving, but somehow a little less "magical"	Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, book six in the world famous Harry Potter series, is much better than its predecessor, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Whereas book five seemed bloated and unnecessarily angst-ridden, Half-Blood was spared the verbosity and, so, flowed more quickly. <br /> <br />I read the entire book in two days, just finishing it an hour ago. <br /> <br />I liked the plot twists. I liked the set-up in the beginning with the chapter on Snape. From that I wondered, \\"Is Snape really a double agent?\\" and \\"Is this chapter foreshadowing something important later in the book?\\" and \\"Which side is Snape really on?\\" <br /> <br />Although the end seemingly provides answers to my questions, it still leaves the question unanswered -- at least in my mind -- \\"Which side is Snape really on?\\" I won't give away specific plot points, in case there are some still reading the book or deciding to. I have a hunch that the story of Snape isn't fully revealed and that another plot twist may be in the offing for book seven. <br /> <br />As reported, a major character dies. I wasn't entirely surprised by which one, but it still wasn't fun to read. <br /> <br />Also as reported, romances flourish between the main characters and others. That was a nice touch on author J.K. Rowling's part, although I wish she had developed the relationships more. (In the end, one of the characters tells his new love interest that he can't see her any more. It was a line of reasoning taken straight out of a Spider Man movie and rang a little hollow.) <br /> <br />The ending and the set-up for book seven (which purports to be the last one) only raises more questions. In fact, what Harry has to do in the last book is so involved, difficult and complicated that although I think it will make for a fascinating read, I don't for the life of me see how even 1,000 pages would be enough to adequately tell the tale. Unless something happens in Ms. Rowling's mind between now and the publication of book seven, I don't see how one book will be enough to wrap up the Harry Potter saga. <br /> <br />Half-Blood Prince is a page-turner. It moves swiftly and deftly. Yet, I felt a strange distance from the characters. It felt less \\"magical\\" than previous books. I felt as though I was reading it from afar, or watching the story unravel dispassionately. I don't know why. Maybe I'm years older than I was when I first read the books. Maybe the book was too swift-moving and didn't afford enough depth of character development. I don't know. <br /> <br />One niggling detail that bugged me a few times is Ms. Rowling's use of acronyms such as O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. and whatnot. (I know there was one or two more, but I can't remember them off the top of my head.) Also, situations from the previous book were alluded to but not explained. It has been nearly two years since I read Phoenix, so my memory is fuzzy on what happened previously. Plus, I can't recall what O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. stand for. What I would have liked to have seen Ms. Rowling do is on first reference spell out the acronyms and then in all subsequent references, use the acronym. <br /> <br />In other words, someone just picking up book six would be completely lost. Very little background and explanation for what's going on is offered. It's assumed by the author that everyone knows and remembers all the details of the series. I, unfortunately, did not. <br /> <br />The bottom line? For all its niggling flaws, book six is one of the best books of the series. I think it could have been longer, but it was as long as it needed to be to move the plot forward. <br /> <br />Again, given the ending of this book, I don't see how a single subsequent book is possible shy of 1,000 pages. Too much has to happen to bring this story to a close!	2005-07-17
US	51344109	R35UVIKECY0WY0	1582344167	481973042	Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell	Books	5	6	9	N	N	Spellbinding, Magnificent, Ingenious, Original, Fascinating	I've been listening to Susanna Clarke's Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell in the car for a week or two now -- and I'm only half way through! Yet, the really amazing thing is this: I wish it was four times longer. <br /> <br />I don't know if the Man With the Thistledown Hair has enchanted me, or if I'm just held enthralled by Clarke's narrative (or both), but I know I'm going to be incredibly sad when I've finished this extraordinary audiobook edition of the 10 pound novel. <br /> <br />Describing Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is probably best left to other reviewers (as well as Amazon's own staff). Suffice to say this is a historical novel of English magic in the same way This is Spinal Tap is a \\"rockumentary\\" about a British rock band.  <br /> <br />Which is to say it's a fantastically detailed fake. From start to finish. But you'd never know it. It contains footnotes, sometimes in exquisite detail, of published books that never were...of lively conversations held between people that never existed...combined with historical references (such as to the Napoleonic wars) that serve to give the book an uncanny air of verisimilitude. Like it's a book of history, rather than a novel. <br /> <br />All of which is remarkable enough on its own. But when viewed as part of an intricate tapestry that weaves together stories about fairy kingdoms, England's two best known magicians (the titular Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell), servants, dukes, ladies, wars and  every day life in Britian in the early 1800s...well, it's almost overwhelming. <br /> <br />I used to think Neil Gaiman (who heartily praised Clarke's novel) was the king of dreamscapes and enchantments. I often thought Clive Barker had a corner on writing books so involved, detailed and engrossing that it literally felt like stepping into another world upon opening their pages. I even considered Tolkien to be the master of creating magical lands and creatures. <br /> <br />But Susanna Clarke has them all beat. And I say thatwith all the reverence such a statement requires. <br /> <br />She has a command of the English language that makes listening to her book (which, by the way, is narrated by British actor Simon Prebble) a delight. Honestly, I run the risk of sounding hyperbolic when I tell you that this is the most engrossing, enjoyable audio book I've ever heard in my life. And I include Jim Dale's outstanding narration of the Harry Potter series among those I've heard. Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, as narrated by the remarkable Prebble, offers a world that's deep, rich and real -- despite the fact that the subject matter is (a) made up, and (b) about magic, fairies and magicians. <br /> <br />I can't praise this book -- especially in its audio edition -- highly enough. As I said, I'm only halfway through listening to it. I have no idea where the story will take me. But I'm enjoying the journey like never before. <br /> <br />This book belongs on the shelf of every lover of superb storytelling.	2005-01-28

Their products are the best I've ever found.<br />I even own the other books written by Ron Rubin and Stuart Avery Gold, the &quot;Minster of Tea&quot; and the &quot;Minister of Travel,&quot; respectively, for The Republic of Tea. Success at Life, Dragon Spirit and Tea Chings are all inspiring, interesting books.<br />But there's something about Tiger Heart, Tiger Mind that struck me the wrong way.<br />For one thing, it's merely a reprise of the previous books. If you like the Positive Mental Attitude (the &quot;your altitude is determined by your attitude&quot;) approach to life, there aren't many books better. Rubin and Gold are the best at combining the pithy tenets of Zen with messages from other legendary pick-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps books such as Think and Grow Rich.<br />Yet, I think the message of this book can be boiled down into five simple steps:<br />Step One: Have lots of money<BR><BR>Step Two: Buy a successful company<BR><BR>Step Three: Make millions with said company<BR><BR>Step Four: Travel to the world's most exotic locales<BR><BR>Step Five: Write books about how to have a positive outlook on life<br />I came to this conclusion when I read the book jacket bio on Ron Rubin. It says, &quot;Ron Rubin bought and took charge of The Republic of Tea...&quot;<br />Well, gee, Ron. If I had the wherewithal to &quot;buy and take charge&quot; of a company, I'd do so. But I don't. And neither does 90% of the people who'd buy this book.<br />What I'd like to see Rubin and Gold do next time is write a practical, nuts and bolts book about how to achieve do-able goals.<br />This book, like Stephen R. Covey's The 7 Habits of Highly Successful People only works if you're born with a silver spoon in your mouth, or everyone you meet and work with has also read the book and is willing to play by its rules.<br />I enjoy a good platitude as much as the next guy. But even I -- the hopeless romantic and positive thinker that I am-- know that it takes more than a winning attitude to succeed. It takes hard work, lucky breaks and, quite often, a truckload of money.<br />If I ever stumble upon said truckload, I'll be sure to write a whimsical book about what I do with it.<br />And I, like Rubin and Gold, will likely chuckle all the way to the bank.	2004-05-20

P'arang (the Buddhist name of author Geri Larkin) does what very few other writers are able to do these days: Write a compelling, sometimes humorous, always fiercely insightful book that's hard to put down. <br />In fact, I finished The Still Point Dhammapada: Living the Buddha's Essential Teachings in just two evenings -- and I'm sure I'll refer to it repeatedly in days to come.<br />The purpose of the book is two-fold: (1) It includes a very smooth-flowing, inclusive-language rendering of the Dhammapada, and (2) Interwoven with the Dhammapada is Ms. Larkin's observations about everything from what it's like to provide a haven for the folks in downtown Detroit, to daily struggles to abide by the Buddha's teachings to meetings with everyday (albeit fascinating) people.<br />P'arang's tone is always self-effacing, earthy and compassionate. Real. Sincere. She comes across as someone you'd like to chat with over a cup of tea.<br />For the record, I'm a Christian. Yet, I have recently become fascinated by Zen and have read many books on this ancient worldview. Why? Because I appreciate its philosophy of &quot;mindfulness,&quot; which means to be fully awake and aware of life and to relish every minute, every thing, and every person along the way. <br />Zen is a simple worldview, yet it can be as deep and vast as you'd like it to be.<br />So it's no wonder I enjoyed Ms. Larkin's book so much. Her writing exemplifies what Zen has to offer.<br />If you're wondering how Zen Buddhists live their lives, you ought to consider reading The Still Point Dhammapada. It's one of the best books I've read on the subject -- although I don't think Ms. Larkin's goal was to write an apologetic for Buddhism. I think she just wanted to share her observations and comments about life as a Zen Buddhist teacher. Take 'em or leave 'em.<br />I took 'em. And really enjoyed The Still Point Dhammapada. I found it to be a wonderful peek into the world of Zen Buddhism from someone who knows it well. Ihighly recommend it -- along with The Still Point Zen Buddhist Temple web site.	2003-10-16

Seth Godin is the most astute marketer of the last 10 years. His latest book, Purple Cow: Transform Your Business by Being Remarkable arrives at just the right time to save the corporate world from ruin.<br />Hyperbole? Not at all.<br />As an adjunct professor in a nearby university, I have the privilege of teaching the principles of direct marketing and advertising to the next generation of adcats and DM pros. I base a lot of my class lectures on both personal experience (I've been a direct marketing guru for nearly 15 years) and cutting edge books -- especially those from Seth Godin.<br />What I like most about Seth Godin (in addition to his witty, insightful style of writing) is that he walks his talk...and doesn't bother to sugar coat what's going on in the world today. He tells it like it is. Or, more accurately, how it should be.<br />Seth is right: This is the most challenging time in history to be part of the American workforce.<br />Recent news reports reveal the unemployment rate (at 6.4%) to be the highest in nine years. But the fault doesn't lie with The White House.<br />Companies these days are actually more interested in playing it safe than in reaching for the stars. Ditto for employees. Remarkable ones aren't getting hired any more. Ones that &quot;fit in&quot; are. (Remarkable ones are routinely shown the door.) <br />The result is an endless parade of boring products, services, and employees. <br />And let's not overlook Hollywood. Or the whiney music industry.<br />Both churn out such bland tripe that they seem bent on drowning the world in a sea of mediocrity. So they have no one to blame but themselves if sales are down.<br />Enter the Purple Cow.<br />Seth's message is simple: BE REMARKABLE.<br />That's it. He calls on companies to be unique and exciting. He calls on employees to be extraordinary, to think big thoughts, to stand out.<br />Here's a personal example. I put the principles of Seth's book to work in my own advertising agency. WhenI started PurpleCrayon Direct earlier this year, I aimed for a target audience roughly the same as every other agency...and got literally zero reponse.<br />So I stepped back, rethought my strategy, and relaunched PurpleCrayon Direct to a completely new and unique audience: Artists. We now work with painters, musicians, actors, writers, sculptors, dancers, poets -- anyone who makes his or her living (or would like to) as an Artist with a capital &quot;A.&quot;<br />And it worked. Big time. The buzz has been amazing.<br />So I know from observing society (and talking to friends out of work and looking for jobs) that America is in trouble. Forced sameness is crippling the human spirit and destroying hope.<br />But I know from personal experience what the answer is: BE REMARKABLE.<br />Thanks to Seth Godin's latest book, I'm more excited than ever before about my professional life. I may still go down in flames with my agency. But at least I'll go down giving it my best shot, being true to myself and to my clients.<br />I highly recommend Purple Cow: Transform Your Business by Being Remarkable.<br />It worked for me. It'll work for you, too.	2003-07-08

I also have all of the previous British editions in book form. I am a die-hard Harry Potter fan. (I even waited at a local bookstore until 12:01 on the 21st to get my copy.)<br />That said, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers: This installment of the marvelous Harry Potter series needed severe editing. It also needed a plot that wasn't so contrived. Not to mention characters who weren't like themselves.<br />I found the book to be utterly boring for the first 100-200 pages, then emotionally overwrought in the middle 400-500 pages, and then wrapped up without so much as a scary confrontation with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named in the last couple of chapters.<br />What's the matter with Harry? Why is he so quick to turn on everyone? He snaps at his elders. He snaps at his friends. He snaps at Dumbledore. It's no wonder people can't take him seriously! He can't seem to speak to anyone in a civil tone or get off his poor-me bandwagon. I'm beginning to think his troubles with Snape are his own smart-mouthed fault. You reap what you so, dude.<br />And what's the matter with J.K. Rowling this time around? She even managed to make Hogwarts -- magical, mysterious, marvelous Hogwarts -- dire and dull. Returning characters Moody and Lupin were just there to take up space for all the life she infused them with.  <br />I think Rowling made the mistake of thinking more is more. It isn't. More was too much. WAY too much.<br />Did anyone else think the book seemed to be depressing, overly filled with violence and anger, and completely mired in political shennanigans? My wife and I listened to the book on CD (Jim Dale is still the best reader I've ever heard!) in the car and she asked me at one point, \\"What kid is going to like all this political stuff? It's way too serious and complicated and frustrating!\\"<br />I agree.<br />But what I find even more frustratingis slogging through 700 pages of a book so bogged down in plots and subplots and characters behaving totally out of character that I could barely finish it...only to have it wrap up neatly and completely within the last 20 pages or so. <br />Deus ex machina at its most wretched!<br />For example, at the end of the book, the Ministry of Magic does an about-face and retracts everything it had said all during the book. The Daily Prophet suddenly makes Harry out to be a hero. Dumbledore confesses things he should have confessed years prior. Harry's would-be relationship with Cho fizzles. Etc. etc.<br />Seven hundred pages of set-up...and 20-30 pages of wrap up -- INCLUDING a snooze fest of a confrontation with Voldemort.<br />Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (book four) was gripping and fascinating and well written and completely spellbinding. The fight scene with Voldemort was one of the most terrifying I'd ever read.<br />Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, on the other hand, is an extremely lackluster book that wouldn't have stood on its own apart from the previous four books in the series.<br />I hope the next Harry Potter book doesn't take three years to write, and is at least 50% shorter. I also hope it's a return to the fun and good naturedness of the first books.<br />If the next book is anything like Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, not even Harry will be able to rise from the ashes.	2003-07-07

I've read the Sandman series.<br />I've read Neverwhere and Stardust and American Gods and Smoke and Mirrors, too. Neverwhere is unbelievably brilliant and creative. Stardust is cute, and clever, but not extraordinary. American Gods is clever, but undeveloped in its execution.<br />I also have Gaiman's other works with illustrator Dave McKean -- The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch: A Romance...the Day I Swapped My Dad for Two Goldfish...Dustcovers: The Selected Sandman Covers and others.<br />So I'm no stranger to Neil Gaiman.<br />Neither am I devoid of ability to recognize talent, creativity and passion.<br />That said, I must admit Coraline left me cold. Not much went on in the book. The characters were flat. And it seemed very dark for supposedly being a children's book.<br />Frankly, the same problem that plagued American Gods seems to run rampant through Coraline: a good idea left undeveloped.<br />Coraline starts out promisingly enough. A big old house. A curious little girl. A bunch of odd neighbors. And a locked door with a brick wall on the other side. Great premise. Lots of things could happen in such a setting.<br />Things do happen, but too quickly without any character development. The stories goes from zero to 60 in a couple of pages and then wraps up -- before any explanation is giving as to why this other world existed, who or what those \\"other parents\\" are, who the strange neighbors are, and why the little girls seems wise beyond her years, able to face terror with hardly a blink of her eye.<br />I think Neil Gaiman needs a hard-nosed editor, one who'll tell him, \\"Great idea, Neil. But it needs to be developed more.\\" Or, \\"Good draft. Could be published as-is. But I think it needs a bit more fleshing out in these areas...\\"<br />I said it in my review of American Gods, and I'll say it in my review of Coraline: Neil Gaiman is extremely talented and creative, but his best work is still ahead of him.<br />I can't recommend Coraline.	2003-02-10
US	51344109	R3IBMAQZ3P6OUX	0805054081	156310833	The Book of Illusions: A Novel	Books	4	29	32	N	N	Vivid, expertly written, compelling, for the mind's eye	After reading a few of the other reviews, I feel somewhat inadequate to render my opinion. I know I won't come close to delving into the deeper meanings and darker shades of Paul Auster's book -- which is odd for me because I usually analyze things to death. But I'd like to describe what the book -- at face value -- meant to me.<br />To start with, with The Book of Illusions I turned off my mind and just enjoyed what I can only describe as a novel with more detail, believability, and fictional reality than I have ever read.<br />\\"Fictional reality\\" is probably a good term for it, too. Fictional reality is the currency with which this exceptional book conducts its business -- and in a manner so believable I began to question if this was fiction at all. (Shades of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil!)<br />Did Hector Mann ever really exist? No, he didn't. But you wouldn't know that by reading Paul Auster's book. Auster paints such a vivid picture of the silent-era movie star and his life that I often wondered to myself if the entire book was based partly on fact, and merely cleverly veiled. (Just to make sure, I checked the Internet Movie Database under the name \\"Hector Mann.\\" No precise listing came up under any cateogry.)<br />I have never seen such rich detail about a fictional person's life! It's astounding to me that the films the book's main character, David Zimmer, describes in painstaking detail never really existed. Dialog, facial expressions, plots, the names of other actors, the names of directors and producers, and the descriptions of the era in which the films were released (the late '20s) are all there in black and white. (No pun intended.)<br />Yet the films were really only \\"seen\\" by one person -- author Paul Auster!<br />What that tells me is Paul Auster has an imagination to rival any sci-fi/fantasy author one could name. He saw in his mind movies that didn't exist, and then had the talent to capture what he saw on paper for us to read.<br />Other reviewers have already detailed the plot. So I won't go into that. I'll just say it's a fairly simple one, really. Nothing earthshattering there. No new ground broken. But Auster takes what could have been the latest Nicholas Sparks novel (and I have nothing against Nicholas Sparks; The Notebook moved me deeply...even changed my life) and infuses it with uncommon three dimensionality.<br />I couldn't put this book down. And I'm not likely to ever forget it. If you like intelligent, compelling novels that (a) don't require a lot of thought to enjoy, or -- paradoxically -- (b) require a lot of though to enjoy, The Book of Illusions will fill the bill nicely.	2002-10-04

His work with The Twilight Zone was stunning. His novels Bid Time Return (which later became the classic movie Somewhere in Time) and What Dreams May Come (which spawned a movie of the same name) are excellent.<br />So it was with great excitement that I discovered this book and bought it. A new Matheson novel! I couldn't wait to read it.<br />Boy was I disappointed.<br />Hunted Past Reason is a pedantic novel with dialog so heavy-handed and stilted that I'm not sure Matheson himself wrote it. How could he have? He's a master storyteller, a legend among legends!<br />Yet, there's his name on the book, and his photo on the dust jacket.<br />The story is about two supposed friends (more like acquaintances) who go backpacking in the wilderness. One man (Doug) is experienced. The other man (Bob) is not. But Bob agrees to go on the trek because he's writing a novel and wanted actual backpacking experience with which to add realism to his book. Somewhere along the way, Doug turns into a maniac and hunts Bob down with intent to kill him.<br />The friction between the two begins immediately...and clumsily. I could tell immediately what was going to happen, and how it was unfolding. The scenes were unbelievably transparent.<br />I never did feel any tension or suspense reading Hunted Beyond Reason. All I felt was a sickness in my stomach from the way-too-graphic scenes of violence (Bob being sodomized by Doug, for example). Ironically, I also found myself pressing forward to complete the novel with the same dogged determination that Bob and Doug pressed through the woods. Not because I was enjoying it, but because I had a destination in mind (the last page) and I wanted to get there as soon as possible.<br />I finished the book last night and felt nothing but relief that it was done. The book's premise is shaky, its dialog is clumsy, and its main characters are unbelievably written. Doug, for instance, is evil incarnate. Bob, on the other hand, compassionately talks to animals and even stops long enough in his haste to flee Doug that he frees a trapped mountain lion. Like, hello! You have a madman at your heels and you're playing Dr. Doolittle?<br />I can't recommend Hunted Beyond Reason. In fact, I heartily suggest you hunt for an entirely different Matheson novel...and let this one remain snoozing with its fellows on the book store shelf.	2002-08-19

What a delightful collection of Sherlock Holems tales!<br />For the record, Three Tales of Avarice includes \\"The Adventure of the Priory School,\\" \\"The Red-Headed League\\" and \\"The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle.\\"<br />British actor Edward Hardwicke does a marvelous job assuming the role of the famous sleuth. And his portrayal of Dr. Watson is superb as well.<br />In fact, Hardwicke's characterizations are among the best I've ever heard. He takes on the voice and personality of each character in the stories and does so in such a compelling way that I found myself so engrossed that I nearly drove off the road listening to his performances. (And they say cell phones are a distraction!)<br />If you're a fan of Sherlock Holmes, I have found these readings by Hardwicke to be the best available. Unfortunately, they're going out of print as fast as I can type this review.<br />So if you want to hear a wonderful actor read stories from one of the world's most lauded authors, please do not hesitate a moment. Buy these delightful stories on CD as quickly as you can!	2002-03-06

So powerful was the spell some of these delicious tomes cast that I can still remember how I felt when I read them. I can picture where they rested on the book shelves. Even their covers have been burned into my mind's eye.<br />And that's saying a lot. Because I'm 41 years old. And some of these books were devoured some 30+ years ago.<br />And in all that time I have never found a book to equal Something Wicked This Way Comes.<br />I read this book yearly, sometimes twice a year. Always in October (my favorite month) and sometimes whenever I need an infusion of wide-eyed wonder.<br />I can't explain what this book does to me. All I can tell you is that each page crackles with electricity. And magic. And all the joys, smells, sounds and feelings of being a boy in a small midwestern town.<br />I doubt anything I say is going to convince you to read this book. After all, it's only my opinion. And you don't even know me.<br />Yet, I can honestly make this prediction. If you have an imagination, a yearning for the days of your youth, a love of night-time thrills and an appreciation for how a master craftsman plies his trade, this book stands a chance of holding a very special place in your heart.<br />Oh. And let's not forget the mournful sound of train whistles and calliopes. You'll find them a-plenty within the pages of Ray Bradbury's marvelous book.	2002-02-28

So much so that I named my Scottish Fold cat &quot;Bradbury&quot; in honor of him.<br />And it's all because of books like this.<br />Zen in the Art of Writing is classic Bradbury: the crisp, short sentences, the vivid mental imagery, the amazing insights into his own writings -- all of it. This book uplifts me, moves me and fills me with awe.<br />It is, without a doubt, the best book on writing I have ever read.<br />Why? Because what he shares seems as pertinent to me as if he wrote it FOR me. Example: Page 17. One day, he discovered that his story titles were nothing more than a list of nouns, such as The Lake. The Night. The Monster. The Town Clock. The Carousel. The Crowd. <br />Such simplicity. Yet, after reading this book I found myself creating my own mental list of titles the same way. Suddenly, just about anything seemed ripe for a story, and infused with some hidden, dark meaning.<br />The Man on the Corner. The Empty Room. The Ten Foot Oak Tree. The Noise in the Basement. The Tea Leaf. The Knight and the Bishop.<br />I don't know why it works for me, but it does. Each of those &quot;titles&quot; (that I just came up with as I'm writing this) could be fleshed out into a story. For some reason, when I see things as nouns, my imagination is uncorked and I begin to feel the urge to explore the thoughts invoked.<br />Try it sometime.<br />Another example: The chapter &quot;How to Keep and Feed a Muse.&quot; Priceless. Magical. He shares ways to awaken the sleeping giant within...and set pen to paper with stellar results.<br />If you're a writer, you need this book. If you're a lover of Bradbury, you need this book. If you just want to know how one of the 20th century's most lauded authors achieved that status, you need this book.<br />I re-read Zen in the Art of Writing whenever I feel my muse begin to slip away like a wisp of fog caught by a sudden breeze. And she returns to me. Grudgingly, perhaps. But she returns.<br />I believe this book could do the same for you.	2002-02-28

The Return of the King starts out slowly, but quickly builds to offer some of the most gripping and emotional battle scenes ever written. The seige of Gondor is awe-inspiring, so well written you'd swear Tolkien was standing there watching it happen before him as he was taking it all down.<br />And that's only in the first 6 discs! It only gets more gripping from that point!<br />*Reading* J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings &quot;trilogy&quot; (I think we all know now it's not really a trilogy, but rather seven slimmer books slapped together to make three fat ones), is wonderful. But *hearing* the books read by a master like Rob Inglis is nothing short of breathtaking. Inglis transforms the books from something you merely imagine into something you actually experience. Each character comes alive and becomes someone you'd instantly recognize should you chance meet him/her.<br />The Return of the King follows on the heels of The Two Towers and picks up the tale of the quest to destroy the One Ring. King is written in the same way as Towers, with multiple tales going on simultaneously. In the Two Towers, the tale is split into three: Frodo and Sam...Merry and Pippin...and Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas. The tales never converge (Inglis' characterization of Gollum in The Two Towers is chilling, by the way -- what a brilliant performance!) and, in fact, seem to splinter even more at the very end of the book. (I won't reveal what happens lest you haven't heard/read it all yet.)<br />King begins with Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli more or less together -- then going their separate ways again...only to come together, miraculously, at the battle for Gondor. And then...well, you'll have to listen for yourself to discover if Frodo succeeds.<br />As with the previous RecordedBooks editions, this CD set is perfect. The sound quality is flawless. Very clear and crisp. Every nuance of Rob Inglis' marvelous voice is heard without spot or blemish. And the 16 CDs (some 15 hours!) seem to fly by. I swear there were times when I didn't want to leave the car because the action was so gripping.<br />As I listened to The Return of the King -- in fact, as I experienced the entire series on CD -- I kept feeling a stirring inside of me that was hard to explain. I think it has to do with knowing one's place in the world, doing what's right, chivalry, gallantry, royalty, kings, queens, etc.<br />For example, whenever I heard one of the characters address someone like Aragorn as &quot;lord,&quot; or when Merry and/or Pippin chose (out of love and respect) to serve their kings to the end if need be, I wondered if we're missing something these days. Actually, I longed to experience the same thing. Some days I just want to be commanded by my king. And I want to follow wholeheartedly as a loyal subject, bravely wielding my sword in battle. Life is so much simpler when you know exactly what to do. Much more clear-cut.<br />But such is the world of J.R.R. Tolkien. Part of its allure is the majesty of the language. Part of it is the unparalleled imagery of the world he created. And part of it is the gallantry and bravery of the characters.<br />If you're new to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series, don't start with The Return of the King. That's the last chapter. Start with The Fellowship of the Ring. Or The Hobbit, which is the &quot;prequel&quot; to the series.<br />But if you want some of the finest audio book experiences you'll ever enjoy, get this set read by Rob Inglis.

I taught Seth's principles in my course on Direct Marketing last semester, and I intend to teach his principles in my course on Fundamentals of Advertising this semester. In fact, I intend to teach his material in every class I have that's even remotely related. Frankly, I think Seth's material should be taught in every university throughout the land -- and shouted from the rooftops amongst those in my profession.<br />Simply put, the material in this book -- deceptively clever, succinct and, at times, humorous -- is explosive. I say deceptive because if you don't \\"get\\" what Seth's trying to tell you, I imagine it would be possible for you to dismiss the entire concept as shallow or gimmicky. However, I believe this information represents nothing less than the future of advertising and marketing. You will ignore it at your own peril.<br />One of the biggest thrills for me was hearing my students put into use Seth's Permission Marketing phrase \\"Turning strangers into friends and friends into customers\\" -- even months after the class ended!<br />Not only is that a testament to the clarity and brevity of Seth's ideas, it's also the distillation of his book's premise.<br />For in today's world, we're bombarded by no less than 3,000 paid advertising messages per day. There's no way we can assimilate, remember and act on that many messages. No matter how creative they may be. It's no longer a matter of breaking through the clutter with killer creative; it's now a battle for one of the most precious commodities we're left with: our attention. And advertisers lose that battle every single minute of every day.<br />Therefore, agencies who seek ever more creative (and expensive!) creative approaches to help boost their clients' sales would do well to read Permission Marketing. Clients who whip their agencies mercilessly, sometimes changing them as often as they change their underwear (because they just aren't seeing the results they expected), would do well to read Seth's Permission Marketing book. BEFORE they blow millions of dollars looking for the next 15-minutes of fame for their advertisement.<br />Odds are, it ain't gonna happen.<br />Permission Marketing clearly describes the problem and equally as clearly provides the answer: ask permission first. Then only send your advertisement to those who ask to see it. Reduced to a catchphrase, what you need to do is turn strangers into friends and friends into customers through the power of direct marketing. <br />Since my field of expertise IS direct marketing, I grasped immediately what Seth was saying. I \\"got\\" it. And I know as sure as I know my own name that what he writes is rock-solid, essential information.<br />The only critical point I'd make is that right now Seth's ideas have a chance to work. And maybe work for a decade or two into the future. But what happens when even those who have given \\"permission\\" to receive advertising messages don't have time to read all the messages they've given permission to receive? I'm a great example of that. I've given permission to receive about a dozen online e-newsletters. (In direct marketing parlance, I've \\"opted in.\\") However, I simply don't have time to wade through them all. (Truth be told, the only one I read -- and look forward to -- on a regular basis is Seth's.) So not all permission is created equal. I imagine as people get even more busy that even those advertisers with whom they have a relationship will begin to see a drop-off in response.<br />But until that time, Permission Marketing should be required reading for all university students, direct marketers (who likely already know its simple, yet powerful message), advertisers, marketers and clients.<br />Once you \\"get\\" what Seth is saying, you'll never look at advertising the same way again!	2002-01-21

Even direct marketing, the profession that most closely adheres to Hopkins' crystal clear, succinct approach, is often in danger of taking the road most travelled and following its advertising brethren into the heart of the woods to wander aimlessly.<br />I'm a direct marketer and adjunct professor at a nearby university. I not only see the value in what Claude Hopkins wrote nearly 80 years ago...I also see what happens when his simple formula for success is ignored, forgotten or never learned. We get Got Milk? ads (a waste of hundreds of millions of dollars that didn't sell one single drop more of the lactose-laden beverage)...ladybugs on rose petals and singing coyotes to sell a once-proud line of cars...and print ads that contain no copy and bewlidering images. We're not only not selling; we're no longer even communicating.<br />Hopkins to the rescue.<br />If you're a copywriter in the profession of marketing or advertising, or if you're a student wishing to gain the best education possible, Claude Hopkins' Scientific Advertising should be in your hands daily. Underline it. Quote it. Memorize it. Pledge allegience to it. Defend it at all costs.<br />This book will help you write more clearly, sell more powerfully and make more money for your clients than ever before.	2002-01-21

And now those who profess it are considered anachronistic at best. And kooky at worst.<br />Ogilvy, a staunch admirer of Hopkins, firmly embraced that tenet -- and it propelled him and his agency (Ogilvy and Mather) to the Mount Olympus of the advertising world. Most importantly, it made his clients rich beyond the dreams of avarice.<br />Ogilvy's writing is captivating. His work, legendary. His ideas, timeless. The information in this book is easily work 10 times the cover price.<br />I've been in the profession of advertising for nearly 15 years. I'm also an adjunct professor at a nearby university. I wholeheartedly recommend Ogilvy On Advertising to my students. I firmly embrace its principles in my profession.<br />And I, without hesitation, urge you to read it as well.	2002-01-21

(Hey, I'm a completist -- or &quot;obsessive,&quot; as some would say!)<br />I also bought this book by Phil Farrand as a sort of guidebook to help me pay even closer attention to the series as I made my way through each season.<br />I agree with previous reviewers in that some of these nits are extremely picky, indeed. But some are downright hilarious.<br />All of them, however, lead me to believe Mr. Farrand has way too much time on his hands.<br />For the record, the Nitpickers Guide for X-Philes takes a very, very, VERY close look at each episode of The X Files for the first four seasons, pointing out continuity, character, geography or technology problems found therein. They could be as nitpicky as dates not lining up with &quot;reality&quot; -- all the way to noticing how props shift from one hand to the other when the camera angle changes, or windows being on a certain wall in one episode and on another wall in a subsequent episode, etc.<br />I found this book to be a lot of fun to read after watching an episode. More often than not, it caused me to re-watch the episode to see for myself the &quot;nits&quot; discovered by the author.<br />If you like The X Files, you'll enjoy this book. If you're not a die-hard X-Phile, this book won't mean much to you.<br />I hope Mr. Farrand writes a second volume covering the next four seasons!	2002-01-04

(Partly because they look so darn cute and partly -- okay mostly -- because of Peter Gether's Norton books.) Being the &quot;completist&quot; that I am (some prefer the term obsessive), I had to buy this book too to make sure all was well with Bradbury (yeah, he's named after the famous author).<br />Unfortunately, Maggitti's book doesn't really satisfy my passion and curiosity for this fascinating breed of feline.<br />For one thing, the book seems slightly outdated. And the pages look -- and often read -- like those of a textbook. Plus, the information seems superficial, almost too basic (even for a feline newbie like myself).<br />In other words, don't expect a lot of passion and humor and a breezy, conversational style. Expect some fairly good information. Expect a slightly detached (read: dry) presentation of facts. Expect a reference book that'll likely sit on your shelf gathering dust once you've flipped through it once.<br />Since there are very few books available strictly about the Scottish Fold breed, you're pretty much stuck with this book or nothing. And, given that choice, I'd say go ahead and buy this book. It's really not as bad as I'm making it out to be. (But it's not a whole lot better, either.)<br />The bottom line: Until someone comes along to write an &quot;owner's manual&quot; book as fun as the Scottish Fold breed of cat, I suggest you turn to Peter Gether's three books: The Cat Who Went To Paris...A Cat Abroad: The Further Adventures of The Cat Who Went to Paris and His Human...and The Cat Who'll Live Forever: The Final Adventures of Norton, The Perfect Cat and His Imperfect Human.	2001-12-27

In my reviews of The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Ring, both read by British Shakesperean actor Rob Inglis, I wrote that the sound quality on these audio books is crystal clear (neither too high, too low or distorted in any way), Inglis's characterizations are spot-on and the story itself (presented here in the only unabridged version available) is engrossing.<br />The Two Towers continues the story begun in The Fellowship of the Ring but introduces new characters, more battle scenes and a nearly palpable feeling of impending doom as Sauron and Saruman search for the ring.<br />Speaking of new characters, I don't think you'll ever find characters more fascinating than Ents. Ents are walking, talking trees found in Fanghorn Forest. Treebeard (a most &quot;unhasty&quot; Ent) is their leader. He's the oldest living thing in Middle Earth. As Inglis read these passages, I could almost picture the unhasty trees talking to Merry and Pippin. And I longed to look into their very old, wise eyes as they did.<br />The bottom line: The Two Towers (part two of the Lord of the Rings &quot;trilogy&quot;) is equal to the previous books in every way.<br />Which means there really isn't much more that needs to be written. This is, without doubt, the best audio books edition of The Lord of the Rings available.<br />How do you know if The Two Towers read by Rob Inglis is right for you? Well, if you...<br />1.

Have a cat you'd like to keep company during the day while you're at work (simply load up your CD changer, push &quot;Play&quot; and &quot;Repeat All&quot; and let Rob Inglis serenade your feline)<br />THEN...<br />This unabridged audio books edition of Tokien's masterpiece read by Rob Inglis is exactly what you need.eed.	2001-12-27

Any book that deals with loved ones dying is sure to cause readers to think hard about their own lives.<br />And make no mistake, Norton the cat was loved. Not only by his human, Peter Gethers, but apparently by everyone with whom he came in contact. Including tens of thousands of readers around the world. And even such folks as Anthony Hopkins, who -- in this book -- personally asks Peter Gethers if he brought Norton with him to a movie preview/party. <br />If even half the things in the Norton books are true (and Gethers swears they're ALL true), then Norton was a unique cat, indeed.<br />Another reason why I titled this a life-changing book is because thanks to Gethers' Norton books (this is the third and final in the series), I bought a Scottish Fold cat that I promptly named Bradbury (after the famous author). Maybe I got all choked up at the ending of this book because Brad was sitting on my lap and I could just picture the emotional turmoil Peter Gethers went through as his beloved companion reached the end of his life.<br />For those of you who don't know what the Norton books are all about, it's hard to explain them. Essentially, and briefly, they're about a Scottish Fold cat (Scottish Folds have the cute folded ears and owlish faces with the big eyes) that goes everywhere his human goes -- literally around the world. The two have humorous -- and sometimes astounding -- adventures that will cause you to raise an eyebrow at the same time they're putting a smile on your face.<br />Even if you don't like cats (the author was once an avowed cat HATER), you'll probably still like the Norton books. The writing is very good, witty and extremely compelling.<br />Don't start with this book, though. Start with the first book in the series: The Cat Who Went to Paris. The Cat Who'll Live Forever recounts the last year or two of Norton's life. Give Norton a chance to grow on you before you read about his demise. I guarantee if you do, by the end of this book YOU'LL be crying, too.	2001-12-27

Rob Inglis' style is perfect for this book. He does the voices well and the story is far richer and more engrossing than that of The Hobbit. (Even though The Hobbit is delightful and unique in its own right.)<br />There really isn't much I can say about these Lord of the Rings audio books that hasn't already been said. This CD edition of The Fellowship of the Ring read by Shakespearean actor Rob Inglis is perfect for you if:<br />1. You love The Lord of the Rings<br />2.

I listen to a lot of audio books.<br />Prior to The Hobbit, I heard Tim Curry read Dune: House Corrino (the last in the Dune Prequel Trilogy)...Edward Hardwicke read Sherlock Holmes...and Jim Dale read the Harry Potter books.<br />All of the above voices are British, so I'm used to that. In fact, I prefer it. A Brit could read a telephone book and it would sound interesting to me.<br />However, despite my penchant for the British dialect, it took a while for me to get used to narrator Rob Inglis' deep, mellifluous voice. I'm not sure why. Maybe because he seemed to read more slowly than the other narrators. Maybe it's because some of his vocalizations sounded similar. Or maybe it's because I've read the story before and I kept waiting for the next exciting thing to happen.<br />Or maybe it was the songs J.R.R. Tolkien's characters burst into from time to time throughout the book. Inglis actually sings the songs! His singing voice is very good, but the songs seemed to last forever. (I fast forwarded through a few of them.)<br />All of this is starting to sound as though I didn't like Inglis' reading of The Hobbit. Pish-posh. As it said, it took a while to get used to, but I quickly did so -- and hated to see the story end.<br />A classically-trained Shakespearean actor, Inglis is a natural to read Tolkien. He has an incredibly expressive voice. Because of its baritone nature, his renderings of dwarves, dragons and goblins was dead-on.<br />As I mentioned, I've read The Hobbit many times. I bought my first copy of it in the early '70s, in fact. But this is the first time I've ever heard it read to me.<br />It was positively delightful! Perhaps Tolkien intended for his story to be read aloud. I don't know. But I loved listening to the adventures of Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin &amp; Company and all the creatures they encounter in their journey to Smaug's lair. Especially by a reader with such a marvelous voice.<br />The quality of this 10-CD set is impeccable. The voice is clear and crisp. The sound level in all CDs is perfect. I have nothing but praise for this unabridged audio book.<br />Which is why I bought Inglis' reading of Tolkien's other (perhaps more famous) works: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and Return of the King. Collectively known as The Lord of the Rings.<br />I have my listening cut out for me!lear and crisp. The sound level in all CDs is perfect.

This book is so sublimely beautiful that it makes me cry every time I read it. And I'm an adult!<br />Similar in format to Harry Chapin's &quot;Cat's in the Cradle&quot; song, The Giving Tree is the story of a young boy and his favorite tree. As the boy grows older, his need for the tree changes. Yet, the tree keeps giving (hence, the book's title), meeting every need -- however extraordinary or simple -- the ever-aging boy puts to it.<br />The ending is perfect. Once, I read this book to a couple of little girls (5 and 6) and I choked up at the end. I seriously doubt the girls fully understood this book's deep meaning, but they loved the story nevertheless. And it'll stick with them.<br />The Giving Tree is an extraordinary book, simple yet remarkably profound. To me, it's a very emotional story, one that resonates deeply within me. I highly recommend it.	2001-11-15

I must admit, I get caught up in Left Behind mania from time to time. I've read half of the books. I've listened to a few on CD in the car. I've met co-author Jerry Jenkins on his book tours. I even think it's great when local morning newscasters talk about reading the latest book in the series.<br />However, all emotionalism and hype aside, something always made me uneasy about the books and their theology. I just couldn't seem to find the verses to support their multi-layered, fanciful theology.<br />End Times Fiction tells me why: the verses don't exist.<br />I just finished reading Gary DeMar's book and now I'm beginning to wonder what Tim LaHaye is up to (besides building a massive marketing empire based around his books -- much like Bruce Wilkinson has done with his ridiculous Prayer of Jabez book). If the Bible is as clear as DeMar indicates that it is, why is LaHay continuing to support, defend and propagate a theology as flawed as any a member of a cult would put forth.<br />End Times Fiction slowly, carefully and clearly tackles each of the theological points found in LaHaye's enormously popular Left Behind books (and in his recently published -- or re-issued -- books on prophecy), comparing LaHaye's statements with verses he uses to support them. They don't match. What LaHaye is telling the world just can't be found in Scripture.<br />If you've read the Left Behind books (as I have), or know someone who has, or if you've been scratching your head trying to figure out how all of the the weeks, years, events and predictions fit with Scripture, you need to read this book and pass it along.<br />Scripture isn't as esoteric as LaHaye makes it out to be. Nor is it as convoluted and spooky.<br />Gary DeMar's book makes things very clear and plain.<br />But be forewarned: After reading this book, you won't look at the Left Behind books -- or their author Tim LaHaye -- the same way ever again.<br />Yet, you may just come away with an even stronger, more biblicallysound and solid, faith. And that's a very good thing, indeed.	2001-11-15

It's nearly impossible to heap too much praise on The Phantom Tollbooth. I read it for the first time 30+ years ago and I never, ever forgot it. I still read it -- and I'm 41 years old!<br />One of the biggest thrills of my life (okay, so maybe I lead a sheltered life) was actually meeting the author, Norton Juster, on a book signing tour in the Milwaukee area about four years ago. After raptly listening to him read his favorite passages from the book, I walked up to his table, shook his hand and said, &quot;I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed this book since I first read it three decades ago. It's still one of my favorite books. Thank you for writing it.&quot;<br />I know that wasn't the most eloquent thing I could have said, but I was completely in awe. Norton Juster is an almost mythical author to me and his book The Phantom Tollbooth is legendary. The only thing that could have affected me more is if I'd met Crockett Johnson, author of Harold and the Purple Crayon. (That's the other kids' book that touched my soul and helped shape my soul.)<br />Anyway, Mr. Juster signed the hardcover &quot;anniversary edition&quot; of The Phantom Tollbooth and I went on my way, smiling as broadly as if I'd just won the lottery.<br />It's hard to describe the plot of The Phantom Tollbooth and do justice to its puns, literary style and mind-bending, imaginative scenarios. Basically, it's the story of a young boy named Milo who finds everything boring in life -- until he discovers a toy car that takes him on an incredible journey to a land sharply divided into the land of numbers and the land of words. The characters he meets along the way are among the most clever and memorable I've ever read. And the narrative is razor sharp, with plays on words flying fast and furious.<br />Simply put, The Phantom Tollbooth is a feast for the imagination, a seven course meal for the mind, pure nourishment for the soul.<br />Sure, this is considered a kids' book. Yet, there is still enough depth and complexity and entertainment to keep adults on their toes as well.<br />If you're an adult who's never read The Phantom Tollbooth, go buy a copy. (Or order one from Amazon if you're shy about being seen buying one at your local bookstore.) If you have kids, do them a huge favor and give a copy to them (I'd tell you to read it to them, but some of the plays on words can only be discovered by seeing the words in print; they need to read it for themselves to fully appreciate it).<br />There aren't many books around this intelligent and fun -- especially for kids.

Say what you will about the writing skills of Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, their story makes for incredibly gripping listening. <br />Especially with the superb vocalizations of reader Tim Curry.<br />As I've noted in my reviews of the previous two readings (Dune: House Atriedes and Dune: House Harkonnen), Curry handles the reading duties with exceptional wit, zest and obvious enjoyment. His vocal renderings of the characters are nothing short of perfect.<br />I bought this cassette edition the week it came out and I've been listening every day since. There are times when I simply don't want to get out of my car because I'm right in the middle of an action sequence and I want to discover how it turns out.<br />The tapes begin with a bang -- Fremen attacking and easily verpowering sloppy, slumbering and drunken Harkonnen soldiers who are guarding an illegal stockpile of melange. From there, the story line jumps from the shortsighted, self-centered schemes of Emperor Shaddam Corrino to the synthetic spice research and manufacturing on IX to the relationship between Duke Leto Atreides and his concubine Lady Jessica to Prince Rhombur Vernius' attempts to return to his captured planet to...<br />Let's just say there are so many plot threads and jumps to another world, another character, another violent plot from either Baron Harkonnen or Shaddam Corrino that you won't get bored. Not even slightly. Even though I know how the story eventually turns out (because of Frank Herbert's Dune book), I'm still caught up in the drama of it all -- relishing each plot unfolding.<br />I haven't finished the tapes yet. But I can tell you I'm hanging on every word and I will, truly, be sad to see the story end.<br />If you want to be highly entertained with a darn good story, and you have drive time to and from work or various locales, please don't hesitate to pick up this cassette series. <br />That goes double if you've already spent time with the Dune world as seen through theeyes of Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. This chapter in the saga is better than Dune: House Atreides and on par with -- or even slightly better than -- Dune: House Harkonnen.<br />Now, if you'll excuse me, I want to get back to the story...	2001-10-18
US	51344109	R3P817VDHIB8GD	0684801051	607441444	Time and Again	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Clever, surprising historical romance w/ time travel twist	I was vacationing in Pentwater, Michigan, this past weekend and saw Finney's Time and Again on the bed and breakfast's library shelf. Strange, I thought. This is only a &quot;library&quot; of two book shelves of varied literary styles (from Tolkien to Sheldon to the Bible); coincidental, as well, since I had this book in my hand two days before and almost bought it...but decided to read it another day.<br />Well, that day came. I read the entire book over the weekend, mostly in the mornings before breakfast...and Saturday night from about 3:30 a.m. until 5:30 a.m. <br />The subject matter fascinates me. I've always loved stories about time travel. Some of my favorite episodes of The Twilight Zone touch on that subject (&quot;Walking Distance,&quot; especially). Plus, one of my favorite movies of all time is Somewhere in Time. On top of that, I'm in advertising. So the main character's profession was of interest to me as well.<br />I had never read any of Finney's books before, although I was aware Richard Matheson borrowed heavily from this book for his own book, Bid Time Return -- which became Somewhere in Time. (In the movie Somewhere in Time there's a running reference to a time travel book called, I think, Travels Through Time by a Professor Finney. That was Matheson's tip of the hat to Finney's book.)<br />Because Finney was new to me, I didn't know what to expect. I wasn't familiar with his style, his plots, his characters and his endings. So I savored every word, only reluctantly putting the book down throughout the day (such as when I sat on the beach for three hours; in hindsight, a mistake since now I look like a boiled lobster). <br />I've read other reviews that complain about the intricate details of New York getting in the way of the story. Baloney. The rich detail only adds to the realism and makes the story that much more fascinating. Finney's description of 1880s New York, for example, is totally engrossing. I longed to see it myself!<br />Of course, maybe one of the reasons why I liked the detail so much is that I've stood outside the Dakota building. I've been in Central Park. I've looked up at the spires of the Dakota from within Central Park and was blown away by the architecture. So, that probably helped make the book more &quot;real&quot; to me.<br />Nevertheless, Finney's slavish attention to detail helped make the story &quot;believable.&quot;<br />As the ending approached, I kept wondering if Simon Morley, the main character, would stay in the past, or return to the present. Would he be with Julie, from 1880s New York, or return to his girlfriend in present day New York. Or would one of them join him in either era? I honestly had no idea what would happen!<br />Admittedly, I had to read and re-read the part in the beginning about the letter mailed on blue stationery a half dozen times or more to make sure I got the names and dates correct. But I was amazed how all the subplots came together in the end. Surprises abound, let me tell you.<br />Speaking of surprises, the ending was a total shock. Not necessarily which era Si Morley chose to stay in, but the little twist regarding the Project. My mouth dropped open when I read the last page...and I quickly turned back to the beginning to re-read the setup...then back to the ending. Brilliant. I never would have thought of that.<br />The only strange letdown, to me, was the note at the end of the book from &quot;J.F.&quot; regarding Simon Morley's adventures (was it called &quot;Afterword&quot;? I don't remember). At first, I thought it was a cool idea that &quot;J.F.&quot; would recount how he came to write Simon's story. That makes the book seem that more more &quot;believable.&quot; But too much is said, too much is unsaid, and the last line sort of deflates the book's own ending. I have mixed feelings about that one page. I would have left it out, or written it differently.<br />By the way, the title of my review represents my opinion that time travelis only an incidental, albeit necessary, part of the book. So if you don't like science fiction, please don't shy away from Time and Again. It's not a science fiction book. To me, the book was a melancholy historical romance that just happened to have a time travel twist to it. In other words, anyone who likes a really good love story, especially one that takes place - in large part -- in the past will love Time and Again.<br />And if you just so happen to be a sci-fi/time travel buff like me, then you just may find Time and Again that much more fascinating.	2001-08-06

I love everything about them -- from their scores (especially those by John Williams or James Horner) to the actors (particularly Sean Connery, Gene Hackman, Kevin Spacey and Cary Grant) to the directors (Shyamalan, Cameron, Welles and Reiner) to the screenwriters (Mamet, Shyamalan and, of course, William Goldman).<br />Goldman's book &quot;Adventures in the Screen Trade&quot; is one of the best books I've read in years. It is chock-full of fascinating anecdotes...crisp, witty, honest writing...and enough &quot;dirt&quot; on Hollywood to keep a half dozen gossip columnists busy at their keyboards for days.<br />So well-written and fun is Goldman's book that I think even if I wasn't a budding screenwriter and avid movie-goer, I still would have found his peek behind the scenes in Hollywood to be an engrossing read. <br />But for me, a true film nut, this book is indispensable. It contains plenty of tips on how to write screenplays, sure, but the most important lesson I learned from Goldman's book is that Hollywood is a brutal, fickle and cutthroat place to do business and that I'd best develop a thick skin if I'm going to send my screenplays there.<br />Since reading Goldman's book, I noticed many of the movies I've enjoyed over the years have been written by him -- including Princess Bride (one of my all-time favorites), Magic, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Misery and even the just-released Jurassic Park 3! <br />&quot;Adventures in the Screen Trade&quot; is a superb book. I highly recommend it.	2001-07-30

I really am.<br />I appreciate clever, creative, inventive, passionate imaginations as much as the next guy. I understand how he revolutionized comic books with his Sandman series. I read Smoke and Mirrors, Stardust, Neverwhere and his kids' book about trading his dad for two goldfish (or whatever it was).<br />Each of the aforementioned books had moments of brilliance in them. Real, genuine creativity coursing through their veins.<br />However, as a whole, I've thought each of his books to be fatally flawed because of some plot, character or narrative defect that caused me to stumble and scratch my head. That doesn't happen when I read Bradbury or Leiber or Tolkien or Lewis or virtually any other of my favorite authors. But it happens with Gaiman. It's almost like he's trying too hard to be The Most Creative Writer On The Planet at the present time. I don't know.<br />I eagerly awaited American Gods and snatched it up the week it came out. I read it from cover to cover in about a week, taking it everywhere I went.<br />Sure enough, creativity and solid storytelling abounded. A few parts were gripping and awe-inspiring. Yet, a few parts left me wondering what the hell was going on, why he needed to add that particular part, why he worded it this or that way, etc. In other words, I found myself studying his narrative style more than enjoying a good read. I can do that with other authors (Lawrence Block's Bernie Rhodenbarr mystery series, for example) and not trip up. But I can't do that with Neil Gaiman. When he trips me up, I tend to stay that way for the rest of the book.<br />The creative idea that made American Gods is a surprising, almost profound one. But I don't think it was developed as powerfully as it could have been. The theme and focus seemed to shift from the idea of the gods battling it out, to the main character (Shadow) to subplots and characters that seemed almost too weird to even remotely pass for &quot;real.&quot;<br />Please don't get me wrong. I think Neil Gaiman is very creative and talented. But I also think he's unfairly staggering under a load of critical praise and pressure that may cause him to think more highly of himself than he ought to...or cause his editors to not question flights of fancy that don't seem to go anywhere, or exist only for their own stake.<br />I certainly hope he continues to write books and share them with the world. Although I think American Gods was good, I don't think it's as good as the book he'll likely write five or ten years from now. Given Mr. Gaiman's staggering imagination and talent, THAT'S the book I'm waiting to read!r />Please don't get me wrong. I think Neil Gaiman is very creative and talented.

I read Bruce Wilkinson's The Prayer of Jabez one afternoon and giant red flags kept going up. (In my mind's eye, I pictured the robot in the old Lost in Space TV show waving his arms and shouting, &quot;Danger, Will Robinson!&quot;)<br />Although the book appears at face value to be a call to biblical devotion and trust in God, I have a sinking feeling it's something else entirely. Its premise relies solely on one small, tiny prayer in the Old Testament, transforming it into a mantra that the author guarantees will bless the one who utters it daily.<br />Oh, really? What happened to God's divine will and providence? Does God desire to bless every man, woman and child equally, regardless of their devotion to Him, or lack thereof? And what if Jabez's prayer was for HIM ONLY and not for everyone else to claim as his or her? (Along those lines, the author's theology is more closely related to that of &quot;Name It and Claim It&quot; charismatics -- or New Age charlatans -- than Sola Scriptura Reformed theologians.)<br />If you truly want to know what biblical Christianity is (and isn't) read Francis Schaeffer's books (especially The Great Evangelical Disaster or True Spirituality). Or Dave Hunt's books (especially The Seduction of Christianity, a book written in the '80s that warns of theology such as Wilkinson's).<br />I'm always wary when Christian books become a bestselling media machine. I mean, really, do we truly need The Prayer of Jabez Devotion for Teens? The Prayer of Jabez for Children? The Prayer of Jabez Prayer Journal? Where will it all end -- The Prayer of Jabez Paper Towels? The Prayer of Jabez Jammies? The Prayer of Jabez Thin Mints?<br />I can see why The Prayer of Jabez is a bestseller. It appeals to people's self-centered desire to get what they want out of life. The rock group Queen recorded a song a few years back called &quot;I Want it All.&quot; One of the lines was, &quot;I want it all...and I want it now.&quot; Wilkinson transformed that sentiment into the spiritual solution du jour called The Prayer of Jabez.<br />I want to be blessed as much as the next guy. But the blessings I receive from God are not and cannot be earned by anything I do. If they could, they wouldn't be blessings. I'd deserve them. I'd earn them. And if I ever get to the point in my life when I think I deserve anything from God, I'm in deep trouble.<br />Blessings are bestowed or not bestowed upon me by God's grace alone. Besides, what are blessings? They don't have to be material. Or financial. I see them every day. I am blessed by the world we live in, the relationships I have, my creative talents, my opportunities, my very life. Most of the people in the Bible were poor or of meager means. Is Wilkinson trying to say that if only they had had a copy of his book, the Jewish people wouldn't have been taken into captivity? Or the disciples wouldn't have been martyred? Or Jesus wouldn't have had to die on the cross? Or David wouldn't have lusted after Bathsheba?<br />The Sermon on the Mount tells us &quot;Blessed are the poor in spirit.&quot; The New Testament tells us to be kind to those who are less fortunate, those who need food, water and clothing. Maybe most of the New Testament need not have been written in the first place if only God had foreseen Wilkinson's book telling us we could all be blessed if only we'd pay attention to an obscure prayer written thousands of years ago.

Anderson.  It's actually read by Tim Curry, as was Dune: House Atreides.<br />I disagree with the other reviewers. I thought Dune: House Harkonnen was extremely well done. Especially Tim Curry's reading.  When I first started listening to Dune: House Atreides, I wasn't sure Curry was a wise choice as reader.  (I kept picturing him in Rocky Horror Picture Show, or comedic movies such as Clue.)  But his characterizations grew on me...so much so that I was eager to hear this latest installment in the Dune prequel trilogy. <br />Curry reads with gusto, obviously hitting his stride and feeling more comfortable with the characters.  It was a pleasure listening to him.  (I particularly enjoyed his humming and irritating portrayal of Hasimir Fenring...or the menacing growl that is Baron Harkonnen...or the belly-laugh, slap-you-on-the-back personality of the exiled ruler of IX, the elder Vernius.)<br />As far as the book itself goes, House Harkonnen is a dark, violent and often disturbing tale that reveals just how evil the Harkonnens are.  At times, I stepped out of my car (where I do all my audio book listening as I drive) feeling depressed after a particularly sadistic scene.  But I clung to every word, eagerly awaiting the next time I'd take a drive so I could discover what happens next.  <br />True, House Harkonnen (or House Atreides, for that matter) doesn't have the depth and density of Frank Herbert's original work, but is that really so bad?  Just as there's only one C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien and Ray Bradbury, there's only one Frank Herbert.  But that doesn't mean Brian Herbert is doing his father a disservice.  On the contrary, I think Frank would be proud of his son's efforts to tell a good tale and provide background that many have wondered about over the years.<br />House Harkonnen offers many plot twists, sub plots and interweaving plot lines that require the listener to pay attention, but the pay off is worth it.  The point of view often shifts from planet to planet and from character to character, unraveling (or weaving together as the case may be) plot threads in clever ways...all masterfully leading toward the culmination of the original Dune.<br />One reviewer said there's nothing in Dune about Leto's son Victor.  Granted, but the existence of Victor explains why Jessica felt moved by love to bear Leto a son.  Nothing short of the events surrounding Victor would have made Jessica betray her Bene Gesserit mandate to bear a girl.<br />Another reviewer said House Harkonnen isn't &quot;really about anything.&quot;  Not true.  It reveals how and why Duke Leto Atreides got to be the man he was in Dune.  It reveals why Baron Harkonnen's condition worsened without a cure.  It reveals how Raban got his nickname &quot;The Beast.&quot;  (Trust me; it was a much-deserved name.)  It reveals where Feyd-Rautha came from.  (I keep picturing Sting as Feyd in the movie version.) It reveals the intricate plots within plots of the Bene Gesserit.  It reveals the many schemes afoot among the Great Houses, and why Duke Leto was so protective of his son Paul. It reveals the origin of Gurney Halleck and how he and Duncan Idaho met and why they were so loyal to House Atreides later on. <br />In short, House Harkonnen is &quot;about&quot; many things that interested me.<br />Frankly, I'm surprised the reviewers weren't more kind.  I thought Dune: House Harkonnen was a captivating (if often sordid) tale that kept me listening right through to the end.  On one hand, knowing the end result (like what happens to everyone in Frank's original Dune) took some of the surprise away from House Harkonnen.  Yet, other times knowing the end result made me think, &quot;So THAT'S how that came about.&quot;<br />I was impressed with the complexity and bravado of House Harkonnen, but didn't give it five stars because I thought a few of the plot lines were overly contrived...and a few of the violent scenes were gratuitous.  Can the Harkonnens truly be that evil?  Would Raban really kill his own...? (You'll have to read the book to find out!)<br />I can't wait for the third installment...and hope Tim Curry reads that one as well.	2000-10-16
US	51344109	R1HICWACV9OWBT	0684833743	451667811	The Unruly Life of Woody Allen: A Biography	Books	2	26	37	N	N	An obvious axe to grind -- skip this one	I like Woody Allen.  But I don't like this book.  Author Marion Meade appears hell-bent on painting Woody to be a pedophile, homewrecker,  misogynist, master manipulator of the media (not to mention the public) and  a noteworthy but deeply flawed human being.  (Actually, I just boiled down  her book for you, hitting all the key words and concepts so now you can  save your money for more worthy purchases.)  Better, less barbed, Woody  books are &quot;Reconstructing Woody,&quot; by Mary P. Nichols and  &quot;Woody Allen on Woody Allen: In Conversation With Stig Bjorkman.&quot;  Actually, if you're one of the few people who believe everything you see in  films, and always thought Woody was the same kindly self-deprecating  schlemiel off-screen as he was on (in other words, many of his movies are  autobiographical), then maybe you need Meade's book.  Frankly, I doubt few  stars (be they movie stars, rock stars, sports stars or -- and this may  come as a shock to Meade -- authors) are the same behind the scenes as they  are in public.  And the more creative a star is, the quirkier he or she is  likely to be in private.  No surprise there.  Yet Meade seems to think  everyone has been hoodwinked by Woody Allen over the years...and only she  has the guts to set the record straight, tell it like it is, blow the lid  off, dig up the dirt, etc.  Baloney.  Woody Allen is a creative genius, but  he's not perfect.  No one is.  And I don't need Marion Meade to tell me  that.  Do you?	2000-08-29

Director of Direct Marketing for a major business-to-business advertising agency.  Hold a Master's degree in Communications.  Am a muggle.  And, I'm not ashamed to admit, was totally  captivated (who says they're just for kids?) by the audio CD edition of  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the fourth installment in the  world-famous series by J.K. Rowling.  A few opinions:  I have all three of  the previous books on CD and loved every minute of them.  In fact, there  were times when I didn't want to stop driving and get out of my car (even  when I arrived at my destination!) because I was so engrossed in the  stories.  But if I thought British performer Jim Dale's reading was amazing  before, I was doubly impressed with him this time around.  As you know,  Goblet of Fire is over twice the size of the other books in the series -- a  total of 17 unabridged CDs, some 20 hours!  Plus, there are dozens of new  characters, some of whom are from foreign lands, and some extremely  gripping action scenes.  Yet, Dale seamlessly switched from character to  character, deftly handling all the accents, all the action...all the while  capturing every emotional nuance of Rowling's words.  A less gifted reader  wouldn't have been able to pull it off and surely would have left the  listener scratching his head wondering who's saying and doing what to whom.  Dale must be part wizard himself!  For some reason, I found the first few  chapters (maybe even the first few CDs) slow going.  But the story picked  up steam and by the last 4-5 CDs I literally found myself sitting in  parking lots, with the car's CD player on, not wanting to walk away from  what was happening.  I was riveted.  If you've never heard Jim Dale read a  Harry Potter book before, you don't know what you're missing.  Nothing  brings the books to life like hearing the characters speaking.  And nothing  makes the drive to and from work more enjoyable.  My favorite  characterizations are Dumbledore, Snape, Malfoy, Hagrid, McGonnagal and, of  course, Harry -- but Dale is very adept at making ALL of Rowling's  characters leap off the pages.  The combination of Rowling's imaginative  words and Dale's superb reading make for a spellbinding experience.  (By  the way, if you're thinking of trying the audio version of the Harry Potter  books, you might want to start with something other than the massive Goblet  of Fire.  Goblet is a deep, sometimes dark, often complex and inarguably  lengthy book that will require a more substantial commitment of time and  attention than the other books in the series.  That's not a bad thing,  however.  Just be forewarned.)e Dumbledore, Snape, Malfoy, Hagrid, McGonnagal and, of  course, Harry -- but Dale is very adept at making ALL of Rowling's  characters leap off the pages.

You won't find such literary depth and deftness here.  J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books are much more akin to Roald Dahl's quirky, alternately lighthearted and dark children's  stories.  However, that's not to say Rowling's books aren't well-written,  enormously entertaining and fun.  They are.  In fact, I can honestly say  that very few books of late have delighted me as much -- *especially* the  CD versions.  For as much as I enjoy *reading* the Harry Potter books (and  I have them all in print form), I love *hearing* them even more.  Jim  Dale's readings (especially the briskly-paced and richly charactered third  book, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) have to be heard to be  believed.  Dale is a master storyteller.  He switches between characters  seamlessly, giving each one a different voice and personality.  His English  accent is a delight, and the pronounciations are crisp.  I especially enjoy  hearing the voices of Draco Malfoy, Hagrid and Professors Dumbledore, Snape  and McGonagall (who has a delightful brogue).  I recently purchased the  third book on CD in anticipation of my 3-hour drive (each way!) to Chicago  for a conference.  I loaded up my car's CD changer and listened all the way  down and back, hanging on every word.  Dale's fabulous reading turned what  could have been a long, uneventful trip into a delightful escape to  Hogwarts.  In fact, when I returned home, I didn't want to get out of my  car ... and, I'm nearly ashamed to say, kept looking for excuses to run  errands just so I could continue listening to the exciting story unfold!   Rowling's books seem tailor-made for *hearing*, as if she wrote them  specifically to be read aloud.  So if you've ever wanted to try an audio  book, and if you enjoy reading the Harry Potter series, I highly recommend  Jim Dale's presentations.  Thankfully, the audio versions are UNABRIDGED so  you can enjoy every single word.  I hope Dale continues to bethe reader  for the Harry Potter series.  I can't imagine any other voice for them.   He's a perfect match for Rowling's words.  By the way, I'm 39 years old.   And I was raised on science fiction and fantasy books.  I rank the Harry  Potter books right up there with some of my all-time favorites.  As I said  in the beginning, Rowling's books are not as deep or clever as many of the  classics of the genre, but they're every bit as entertaining in their own  right.  I recommend the books, but I *highly* recommend Jim Dale's reading  of them.  Especially Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.	2000-02-28
