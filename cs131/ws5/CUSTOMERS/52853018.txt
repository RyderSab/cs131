I love Grisham's non-legal books and have found them all to be wonderfully entertaining and this book is no exception.  The scene where the football players were reminiscing over a past played game was wonderful and the reader felt &quot;right there&quot; reliving it all with them.<br />Grisham reminds us that people are not what they seem.  Appearances can be and are deceiving as we see with Coach Eddie Rake.  Inspiring each and every one of his players, Coach Rake's influence flowed into all of their lives long after the glory days of high school football playing was over.<br />It isn't until Rake's impending demise from cancer that most of his former players gather for the inevitable and reminiscent over their &quot;glory&quot; days and what Coach Rake has meant to each of them and to their small town as well.<br />Coach Rake has touched each life that was under his tutelage and more often than not, left an indelible and lasting impression.  The former players also get to see a more compassionate side of Coach Rake that many did not know existed!<br />I found the book to be not only humorous, but uplifting and inspiring as well.  Grisham reminds us that we all make mistakes throughout the course of our lives - what we decide to do with those grievous errors either makes us or breaks us.<br />Highly recommend!	2004-07-15

Be forewarned though, you WILL need a box of Kleenex standing by.<br />Departing from his infamous Alex Cross murder mystery genre, Patterson has written a very loving book on relationships.  Sam is Jennifer's grandmother and the bond that they share is incredibly special.  Through a series of letters left to Jennifer by Sam, Jennifer finds out that the grandmother that she has known throughout her life has secrets of her own.  Jennifer reads these letters at her grandmother's house, while not knowing if her grandmother will be pulling out the coma after her unexpected fall.<br />Jennifer not only learns about herself in these letters, but also finds the \\"real\\" woman her grandmother is and has been and Jennifer is drawn even closer to her grandmother.  Not believing in love after the loss of her soul-mate husband, Jennifer learns to open up the door to the possibility of love and finds that magic still does exist for her.<br />This was a very quick read and the reader is totally absorbed into the secret of the letters and what Jennifer will do with her new awareness of her grandmother.<br />This book is wonderful, with several surprises along the way, keeping the reader guessing on just what will happen.  Full of love and caring on each of the character's parts, this story will stay with you for awhile, as well as bring tears and smiles along with the knowledge that the power of love is indeed strong and eternal.<br />I absolutely \\"loved\\" this book and wish that Patterson would write more books like this. His sensitivity and insight are remarkable.  If you have not read his previous book, Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, I would also highly recommend that incredible love story, which is an actual true story.<br />This book is special and I am sure that a little of its' magic will spill into your life!	2004-07-15

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Absolutely amazing	Bringing Down The House was a very fascinating look at high stakes gambling and mathematics.  Leave it to MIT students to figure out a way to win millions from the Vegas casinos!  It was definitely intriguing to read about their strategy and \\"game playing\\" and how not to get caught!  Probably amazing is more like it!  The book opened a new dimension to card counting that was a real eye opener to me.<br />As glamorous as it all seemed, with all the money being won and lost, I was glad that the author also brought into play the repercussions on getting caught as well as losing.  The allure of millions of dollars along with a proven system of beating the cards and brainy students from MIT proves to be a powerful combination, as the author finds out first hand.  Successes as well as failures are portrayed and one can really see how the \\"gambling fever\\" takes hold and is a hard habit to shake.  Broken relationships and marriages are a given, as is seen first hand.<br />The story is amazing and again, this one of those books that you just can't put down!!!  One has to keep reminding oneself that the story is true!  With all the high tech security systems in place now, I am wondering if the MIT card counters still have the same success as they once knew and if they are still at it!<br />Absolutely fascinating read!  You won't be disappointed!	2004-07-08

In fact, I could not put this book down and just had to finish it before the day or night was done!  The twists and turns throughout the book kept me captivated and I was surprised at end of the book on who the killer actually was!  Brown managed to weave in several suspects and the reader is definitely left wondering as to which one it is exactly.<br />With a race against time, the kidnapper gives the police, as well as radio personality, Paris Gibson, only 72 hours to find the abducted girl.  Within that time frame, Paris and the police department scramble to discover his whereabouts and identity.<br />With several story lines intertwined, Brown did a great job weaving them all together, while having the reader on the edge of their seats the entire time!<br />Great suspenseful story!	2004-07-08

Keene, and his past life recollections as John B. Gordon, a confederate general.  I must start out by saying that I absolutely do not like reading anything to do with history, so I was very hesitant at first to begin this book.  I am, though, very interested in past life material and gave it a go.  I was very pleasantly surprised as I was unable to put the book down and finished it within 24 hours!!<br />Keene's fascination began as he had a very strange experience while visiting a battlefield at Antietam, coincidently, the very same battlefield on which General Gordon was wounded.  Shortly thereafter, a chance meeting with a psychic at a party, led him to further delve into the Civil War past and his connection with General Gordon.<br />Not only are the pictures of both Keene and Gordon incredibly and uncannily striking, but the fact that they both share the same six placement of scars on their bodies just adds that much more credibility to the entire story.  Keene presents such compelling evidence, that one comes away with wonderment.  Even parallels with their writing styles is pretty incredible!<br />Dr. Brian Weiss, in his books on past lives, also stated as does Jeffrey Keene stated, that soul groups tend to reincarnate in groups, and that it is not uncommon to find members of the same family as well as close friends, together over multiple life times.  Ironically, or maybe not - several of the men in Keene's department, also share incredible striking resemblances to other confederate men who were with General Gordon during the Civil War.<br />The author has done a thorough job researching General John B. Gordon, tracing his lineage as a boy growing up in Georgia, all the way through his death in 1904.  Keene, not being content with the obvious, delved as deeply as possible into as much of General Gordon's entire life history as he was able.  Visiting as many places and battlefields as he could, the parallels between both lives are pretty remarkable and the evidence seems so overwhelming.  The historical writings were a fascinating read, much to my surprise!<br />I think that it is important to note here that Jeffrey Keene did not go searching for any of this to happen to him. Keene's skepticism of hypnotic regression was also not an option for him to explore in further pursuing his recalls.  Instead it was through Keene's memories, which started to come through along with unexplained happenings and feelings, which prompted him to further investigate and explore it all on his own for himself.  Even though Keene was skeptical at first, the more he investigated and researched General Gordon, that the parallels started to become clearer and clearer.  The book is written with intelligence and sensitivity and it is Keene's insight that we much more than our bodies which allows him to delve with an open mind and with much insight into his past life research.<br />Not only is this a great book for civil war buffs, but also for those who are fascinated in past life recall.  Keene now has also become a much sought after lecturer on the Civil war and his research is most extensive.<br />I found this book to be quite extraordinary from several different angles and it would be really hard for one to dismiss Keene's account at all.  Letters are also included in the book from others who have been touched by the media documenting Jeffrey Keene and these others past life recall is fascinating and compelling.  I do believe that skeptics would be pleasantly surprised as well.  Looking at one's own life, including my own, where one has an affinity for a particular place, country, ethnic group or even for a &quot;collection&quot; of objects, or feeling that &quot;one has been here before&quot;, are subtle clues reaching from beyond to remind us that we are much more than our present bodies.  As our minds and thinking become more open, I do believe that we are better able to access portions of ourselves that were previously closed down. &quot;We are all here for a purpose although we many not be aware of that it is. There could by many reasons; to learn lessons, pay back debts to other souls or to serve as an example for others.  This list has no end.  I believe I am performing one of my requirements at this very moment by writing this book.&quot;<br />This book is amazing and it is one of the best books on past life recall that I have ever read.  One also cannot help to be drawn to the author, his experiences, his research, and his insight as well.  Many questions can be raised in one's own life and probably will!  &quot;No one ever dies (at least not in the way many perceive death here on Earth), and Love lasts forever.&quot;<br />Incredible and amazing book in every which way!ieve that we are better able to access portions of ourselves that were previously closed down. &quot;We are all here for a purpose although we many not be aware of that it is.

The Boat of Dreams by Richard Preston is a heart-warming tale of hope and love, which was originally written for his friend who was dying of breast cancer.  This is a wonderful story to share with the entire family, especially during the holidays.<br />Preston brings Santa to life in a very `realistic\\" way, much to both the horror and delight of thirteen-year-old Will and his six-year-old sister, Lila.  \\"Santa\\" teaches Will and Lila to dream their biggest dreams, allowing their love to flow for everyone, as they transverse the world on Christmas Eve in their departed father's beloved lobster boat.  Magic and miracles are in the air as Will and Lila have the adventure of their life on this unforgettable night.  They learn that things are not what they seem and that love does indeed create miracles.<br />This Christmas tale will fill one with hope and love, with several chuckles along the way and will leave the reader with a warm spot in his or her heart along with a tear or two!<br />I heartily recommend this book!	2004-06-28

This is my first experience with any of Anne Perry's books, and it was a big effort to even finish this book.  After finishing the book, I can't believe that I wasted my time even reading it.<br />The story is set \\"around\\" Christmas time and has nothing to do with a \\"Christmas\\" story at all.  The characters are extremely shallow without any depth, the book jacket's hint of a murder and mystery do not materialize at all, and there were many questions left unanswered and I would constantly ask myself, \\"what.....\\"?  Story lines did not connect and the plot did not easily flow.<br />The entire story was unrealistic, bordering on horrible fantasy, as well as lacking in substance and depth.  Not a book that I would recommend to anyone.	2004-06-28

Claiming to be a fictional story, the story is set around true events with a \\"real-life\\" Max.  The healing of Jane's cancer in the story was indeed remarkable, as are the testimonies from some very well know entertainment figures.<br />Vibrational medicine seems to be the way of the future and Lewis seems to be one the forefront.<br />Amazing book to read, lots to think about and to be amazed about as well.  Unfortunately, the process outlined in the book seems to be out of reach financially for a lot of people, and I have to wonder why is that.<br />Sanctuary will not resonate with everyone, as not everyone is ready for the energetic medicine concepts and theories.<br />Read the book and draw your own conclusions but I am still amazed by it all.  It certainly has me thinking and talking people who have tried it.  Again, nothing short of amazing.	2004-05-12

The book started off very slow and I almost put it down.  After the first several chapters or so, I did become more captivated and was intrigued with what was gong on, as I felt that Wilson, the main character was up to something!<br />The story is told though Wilson; so the dialogue is kept to a minimum and Wilson, trying to recapture the love in his marriage, reminisces about his courtship and marriage with his wife, Jane. Wilson realizes through the entire flashback, that he was unable to truly show and verbalize his love for Jane.<br />The ending is indeed a surprise and was very touching and sweet.  But this is not one of Sparks' better books.  I absolutely sobbed though The Notebook, which this book is a sequel to, but this book was dry and flat in most places.<br />Sparks is a great romance writer, but I felt that this book was not up to his usual stellar self.  It is not a bad book..........don't get me wrong! Just not one of his usual gems!	2004-01-08

Get out your Kleenex, as this book is another tear producer!  The Guardian will have you anticipating from chapter to chapter.

Rice manages to immediately draw the reader into the very depths of all of her characters, so that one can feel all of their emotions, all of their struggles and all of their dreams.  Rice weaves magic into all of her stories, filling them with the reality of life, but also with hope and love.  Her characters in this story were complete and the relationships portrayed were intense, believable, and amazing.  Her characters come alive and fill your imagination so that you really don't want to put the book down!<br />This book not only had a romantic twist to it, but it also had a great mysterious and intriguing element to the story.  Rice skillfully led the reader through twists and turns and one did not know until the very end, which character was the perpetrator.<br />Rice's books are not icky sweet romantics, where all the characters live in a fantasy world.  Instead, her books are so filled with life; the realities of life and the messages of love are indeed heartwarming.  Elements of romance and intrigue are woven throughout, interlacing all the incredible relationships.<br />After reading one of Rice's books, one comes away feeling uplifted!

Bravo to the female character, Holly Short, who is the real hero, or should I say heroine in this story!  Eoin Colfer does a great job portraying Holly as smart, ingenious and quick thinking with all the nastiness going on!  The realm of fairies is magical and this book helps bring it to life!<br />I never heard of any hype comparing this series to Harry Potter or even trying to bridge the gap between the Harry books, so I will just say that read this book for itself and try not to compare it to Harry, as this book stands on its own in the genre of fantasy.<br />My 13 year old and 14 year old loved the book and begged me to read it!

I absolutely loved this book and could not put it down.<br />The premise of the book is that people we meet in our lives are put into our lives for a reason, although we may not understand that reason at that time.  The purpose of heaven then, is to understand one's life on earth.<br />\\"People think of heaven as a paradise garden a place where they can float on clouds and laze in rivers and mountains.  But scenery without solace is meaningless.  This is the greatest gift God can give you: to understand what happened in your life.  To have it explained.  It is the place you have been searching for.\\"  Albom reminds us throughout this wonderful tale, that there are no random acts, that we all are indeed connected.  The circle is never ending.<br />The story is seen through Eddie's eyes - the maintenance worker at Ruby's Pier, who dies trying to save a little girl from a crashing carnival ride.  The five significant people in Eddie's life leave Eddie a bit baffled in the beginning, but further on into the story the meaning is very clear and illuminating for Eddie, as for the reader.  The messages are timeless for the reader, but more importantly, healing and bringing a sense of serenity for Eddie, once he understands the significance of it all.  After all, people *are* put into our lives for a reason.<br />This book is wonderfully wise and the serenity and insight contained within will warm one's heart. This book is a departure from Tuesdays With Morrie, yet just as beautifully written, filled with the same heartfelt insight and compassion.  Readers will fall in love with Eddie, just as they did with Morrie.<br />This is book is a definite winner and one will be left thinking and contemplating their own lives afterwards, for days to come.  I know I did!  I cannot recommend this book highly enough!	2003-12-11

Similar to Betty Eadie's and Dannion Brinkley's vivid recalls of their NDEs, Dougherty is also able to recall with vivid clarity his journey and all that was shown to him.<br />Dougherty was living the hedonistic, fast lane of life, with homes in both The Hamptons, and West Palm Beach, driving expensive cars, having many expensive toys, and operating two thriving nightclubs.  Alcohol was his admitted drug of choice, and cocaine use was intermittently part of his lifestyle, as were meaningless relationships with meaningless beautiful women.<br />After suffering an apparent heart attack, Dougherty realized that he was no longer \\"in his body\\", and was met by a former friend who \\"died\\" in Vietnam.  Dougherty recalls in stunning detail his life review, future life events, future world events, including the 9-11 attacks on New York and Washington, his meetings with The Lady of The Light, God, and other spiritual beings.  Because Dougherty's life's mission is not yet completed on earth, he is told he must go back.<br />Needless to say, Dougherty's life is forever transformed after his heavenly encounters, and amazingly, the doctors could not find anything physically wrong with him - all of his medical tests were normal.  Yet Dougherty knew that he had died, but all of the doctors could not find anything indicating a heart attack.<br />As foretold to Dougherty, he indeed turned his life around, and is no longer living a hedonistic, fast lifestyle, but a more spiritual, contemplative one, which includes hospice volunteering, as well as forming his Angels of Mercy organization which provides miracles to those in need.  He is still visited by The Lady of The Light and his devotion and faith in God has deepened greatly.<br />I found this book truly amazing, and I have read all the NDE books that I can, and this account is one of the best.  His honesty and admittances of his former lifestyle helped to portray him as he truly was/is.  He was not portrayed as someone without any flaws, or perfect.  I am sure that all readers can relate to his imperfections in one way or another.  The reader can only \\"try\\" to relate to his struggles and difficulties in \\"trying\\" to live an earthly existence, after seeing and experiencing all that he had with his celestial encounters.  Synchronistic encounters reaffirmed to Dougherty that all that happened did indeed happen.  Events shown to him that would occur in his life happened not according to Dougherty's &quot;trying&quot; to make them happen, but instead they happened according to God's plan.<br />I have to disagree with the other reviewers, as I think that they tended to focus only the events which were predicted for 9/11 and entirely missed the messages contained within the book.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in NDEs.  There is a most startling message in the book from Archangel Michael that was given to Dougherty, that is worth reading several times over.  A message for us all.<br />This book is just another confirmation to us all that there is nothing to fear in dying, that we all are constantly guided and loved, and that we only have to ask for help from above.

Preceded by the Indigo Children, these Crystal children are pretty special and amazing, according to the first-hand accounts related by the parents and grandparents.  Born totally psychic, sensitive, compassionate, empathic, loving, and kind, these children are able to constantly communicate with the angles and spirits around them, as well as the nature spirits.  Again, the true stories presented in the book will astound you.  Not all the children will present with all the abilities as related in the book, but clearly, most have many special and healing abilities.  Filled with the utmost love and compassion, I do believe, as Dr. Virtue believes, these children are here to spread love, truth and compassion.<br />I felt that the book was a bit repetitive at times, which was not necessary, and I also found the first hand accounts of these children just fascinating.  The book is a very quick read, as I did not want to put this book down, due to the amazing subject matter.  While reading this book, I realized that several children I know are presenting with many of the attributes listed.  Dr. Virtue also made sure to drive the point home that these children talk later in life, that they are NOT autistic, as society wants to put a \\"label\\" on them, but rather, they are observing and will talk when they are ready and usually in complete sentences.  I also believe that it takes very aware and in-tune parents as well to raise these children.  Most parents also relate that even though their children speak later in life, they have no trouble whatsoever in understanding them - telepathic communication.<br />Lovely, wonderful book - highly recommend it for those parents and teachers, whose lives are blessed by these special angels - just overlook the repetitiveness!	2003-08-04

Similar to Betty Eadie's and Dannion Brinkley's vivid recalls of their NDEs, Dougherty is also able to recall with vivid clarity his journey and all that was shown to him.<br />Dougherty was living the hedonistic, fast lane of life, with homes in both The Hamptons, and West Palm Beach, driving expensive cars, having many expensive toys, and operating two thriving nightclubs. Alcohol was his admitted drug of choice, and cocaine use was intermittently part of his lifestyle, as were meaningless relationships with meaningless beautiful women.<br />After suffering an apparent heart attack, Dougherty realized that he was no longer \\"in his body\\", and was met by a former friend who \\"died\\" in Vietnam. Dougherty recalls in stunning detail his life review, future life events, future world events, including the 9-11 attacks on New York and Washington, his meetings with The Lady of The Light, God, and other spiritual beings. Because Dougherty's life's mission is not yet completed on earth, he is told he must go back.<br />Needless to say, Dougherty's life is forever transformed after his heavenly encounters, and amazingly, the doctors could not find anything physically wrong with him - all of his medical tests were normal. Yet Dougherty knew that he had died, but all of the doctors could not find anything indicating a heart attack.<br />As foretold to Dougherty, he indeed turned his life around, and is no longer living a hedonistic, fast lifestyle, but a more spiritual, contemplative one, which includes hospice volunteering, as well as forming his Angels of Mercy organization which provides miracles to those in need. He is still visited by The Lady of The Light and his devotion and faith in God has deepened greatly.<br />I found this book truly amazing, and I have read all the NDE books that I can, and this account is one of the best. His honesty and admittances of his former lifestyle helped to portray him as he truly was/is. He was not portrayed as someone without any flaws, or perfect.

Reading books about NDEs to only find out about \\"future predictions\\" is pretty lame, when there are incredible messages contained for us all.<br />This book imparts some very important and beautiful messages which are incredibly timely for what we are living though now.

WRONG.  This is by far THE worse children's book that I have ever read.  Parents don't waste your money on this book. It is not even worth the time to go the library and check this book out.<br />I do believe that a junior high student could easily write a much better book.  The grammar is awful - flow and transition from one paragraph to the other is missing - the subject material does not even make sense - thoughts are scattered - character development is nil - and 99.9% of the book is boring.  I forced myself to finish the book and struggled the entire way to do so.<br />But MOST IMPORTANTLY, this book is depressing, filled with negativity, constant threats of killing the children, perverse humor, and inappropriate adult themes.  Joy, happiness and love are definitely missing in this book. This is not a book to build a child's self esteem or instill messages of self worth or confidence.<br />There is absolutely nothing to like about this book.  I would urge parents to steer their children away from all of the books in the series - like another reviewer said - there are so many other BETTER books out there to read. Lemony Snickett is not one of them.<br />If I could, I would give this book a negative 10.	2003-07-27

I believe that Ms. Brown mentioned that the book was written in 1982 and she should have left it there.  Touted as a \\"classic love story, I found absolutely nothing \\"classic\\" about this book.

I have read all of Hannah's books, and each and every one of her books is endearing and so filled with life's realities.  Hannah is able to draw the reader directly into the story and one just does not want to put her books down until the every end!  The reader is relating to all the characters by feeling all of their emotions and seeing their world perfectly due to the artistry of Hannah's words.<br />I love Hannah's books, as they are so full of hope and love, even through the challenges that life presents each and every one of us.  There is nothing stronger than love and Hannah portrays that so very well in all of her books.  A crisis surely pulls a family together, where the love of one another is able to overcome even the strongest challenge.<br />Hannah portrays that so well with her latest book on the bond of two sisters, broken apart by life, yet love pulls them and those around them closer together.  Love heals, as Hannah so clearly shows.  Sisters torn apart by family forces yet brought together again though their love of one another.<br />Hannah's books are not only wonderful stories, but she also weaves a message throughout her books that just fills one with hope.<br />I loved this book and highly recommend it anyone!

Her books are uplifting, affirming and she instills such hope and confidence in oneself that one does come away feeling that one \\"can do it\\"!<br />Ponder's life story is amazing on many levels and she never seemed to give up when life handed her yet another challenge.  With her faith and trust in God, she embraced each and every challenge and kept going, climbing even higher in the process.<br />Meeting Kelly Ponder in her first assigned Unity church in Alabama, it would be another ten years or so before they would fall in love and marry.  Their relationship was truly a soul mate union and they fostered each other's growth in tremendous ways, leading Catherine to develop and grow another Unity Church in Austin, Texas.  Kelly's unexpected and untimely death was a shock to read, but through the rest of the book, one feels the love and guidance from Kelly to Catherine from the other side throughout her life.  Catherine went on to establish more Unity Churches and each one of them has grown and prospered and still continues to this day.<br />Catherine's life story is so uplifting, so amazing and so lived with faith and trust.  Her example to us is quite incredible.  I have read 4 of her other books and am thirsting for all the other ones!  She writes to the reader and provides so many examples of others putting her affirmations and suggestions into action and experiencing life changing results.  Her words of encouragement, her examples of affirming prosperity, as well as her unwavering trust and faith in God are constant reminders to us all that we can do it all as well.<br />This is truly a prosperity love story on many levels.  Catherine Ponder is one amazing lady, and she has blessed us with her many books on achieving all that we want to achieve.  Our fear is our limitation to our achieving our success.  Catherine lovingly shows us how to get rid of that fear.<br />A wonderful book from a most wonderful lady!  The reader is also treated to pictures of Catherine and Kelly as well as her son.  I highly recommend this book to all who are searching.  One cannot help but be uplifted after reading a Ponder book!  I so eagerly look forward to the next one!  Keep them coming, Ms. Ponder, they are so needed!!!most wonderful lady!  The reader is also treated to pictures of Catherine and Kelly as well as her son.

DARE TO PROSPER is another wonderful book by this amazing author.  I finished this book in one day and then re-read it again, as the gems of wisdom contained within are huge.<br />Ponder lists four steps for prosperous thinking and how to make your dreams your reality.  Appropriate biblical quotes and abundant examples from readers using her formula for success are contained throughout the entire book.  The methods that Ponder writes about, work incredibly!!  One just has to believe and to change one's negative, limiting way of thinking to positive and prosperous thinking.<br />Ponder also talks about tithing and quoting examples again from the Bible and others who tithed their way to prosperity with God as their silent partner.<br />This small book is packed full of wisdom, insight and tools for one to become prosperous.  Ponder dares you to prosper, as there is abundant abundance in the universe for everyone to partake in.  I really liked the section on developing a master plan for prosperity and Ponder tells you very simply on how to develop your own master plan.<br />Ponder's writing style is very down to earth and using real life examples from others who have employed her methods adds greatly to her books.  Biblical examples are also used, but not to the point where this is a \\"religious\\" book and the reader does not get turned off from the quotes, but I feel that the quotes add greatly to what she is teaching about.<br />Great book - incredible information and methods - HIGHLY recommend Ms. Ponder to all who are seeking a more prosperous life - whether in financial, health, business, or relationship aspects of one's life.  I guarantee that you will want to seek out her other books as well!!!  This is one amazing author!	2003-07-16

I have read this book at least twice and it is one of my \\"must haves\\" in my library.<br />Ponder helps the reader look at all situations in one's lives though new eyes - the eyes of love and forgiveness.  Releasing, forgiving, and loving are all that one really needs to live a most joyous and abundant life.  \\"Release is a form of forgiveness that we all need to practice often.  Emotional release is one of the highest forms of love.\\"  If one has feelings of low self-esteem, low self worth and feelings of helplessness, I guarantee that after reading this book, one \\"can\\" change themselves, as well as their life around forever.<br />We are taught through her teachings of love, that we can heal ourselves on many different levels, including success in our business lives.  One of my favorite quotes (and there are many) from the book is, \\"Whatever your problem it is but a test in love.  If you meet that test through love, your problem will be solved.  If you do not meet that test through love, your problem will continue until you do!  Your problem is your initiation into love.\\"<br />One only needs faith and trust to conquer that which holds us in bondage.<br />I absolutely love this book and when fear creeps in, this book is amazing to refer back to once again let love shine and to live in the light.<br />\\"If you are not attracting the good that you desire in your life, learn to express love; become a radiating center of love: and you will find that love, the divine magnet within you, will change your whole world. . . When your heart is filled with love you will not be critical or irritable, but you will be divinely irresistible.\\"  (A quote from May Rowland as quoted in this book.)<br />This book is a pure gem - may you shine on after you read it!<br />Namaste.book is a pure gem - may you shine on after you read it!<BR>Namaste.	2003-04-15

He also explains the causes for each trigger point and then goes into detail for palpating that particular muscle and treating the trigger point.  The illustrations are concise, numerous and very detailed. Case studies are also presented with each muscle group, so that the reader can more clearly understand the assoicated pain and how to treat that particular muscle.<br />One can use this book without any knowledge of anatomy and be able to understand it and apply the various treatment methods outlined.<br />The information presented is invaluable - a most wonderful resouce!!!	2003-04-12

Any prayer to God is good and God hears all prayers, whether they are memorized and recited or spontaneous.  No one prayer is better than the others.  What is important is that God is a part of our daily life and all of our prayers are \\"good\\".<br />I also was turned off on the chapter on the reference to Satan.  Since we have free will and free choice, the decisions we make our own and not someone else's fault.  We have to take accountability for all of them.  I was also disappointed that this minister did not make mention in his book that God is a forgiving and loving God and when we do make \\"mistakes\\", we are still loved and forgiven.  Reading books about Satan tempting us, etc. is getting old.  We have the ultimate last say on our behaviors and our decisions.  I think that it was Flip Wilson who used to say, \\"The devil made me do it.\\"  Yeah right.<br />Wilkinson also makes reference to his ministry and the summer incident where if they don't get over 100 kids then it is failure for their summer ministry.  What?  What is that teaching children? Just getting one person to have a contemplative life is a success.  It's not about the numbers.<br />I also disagree with his statement that people don't ask God for things for themselves.  Wilkinson makes the supposition that we feel guilty asking for ourselves.  People pray all the time for themselves and for others.  He also says, \\"God answers those who have a loyal heart and pray the Jabez prayer\\".  God answers us all the time.  He does not pick and choose.  What people fail to understand is that the answers we receive may not be the ones we \\"want\\", but what is given to us in for our highest good.  Also, our answers may also not come as quickly as we may like them to.  It all comes down to faith.<br />With all the hype surrounding this book, this book was a huge disappointment, filled with many inaccuracies.	2002-06-08

I also felt I was re-reading sections from her husband's book in her book; his words were just changed around a bit.  There was nothing new nor were any original ideas presented in the book.<br />She makes reference on why God loves to answer such a prayer as the Jabez prayer.  Does that mean that God does not answer other kinds of prayers, and only chooses \\"prayers such as . . .?\\"  I think not.  She talks of women being very fearful and giving up on miracles in their lives.  Well, thoughts have energy and if one constantly thinks fearful thoughts, then fear shows up in our lives.  If one does not believe in miracles happening, then they won't.  Ernest Holmes, in his ministry, stated, \\"Change your thoughts, change your life.\\"  Jesus was able to do what he did, not only because of his faith, but also because of the power of his thoughts.  Faith is a huge concept.<br />The feeling I get after reading this book is that if one says this prayer then the miracles unfold.  If one doesn't believe, or is skeptical, or has negative thoughts, their lives will not change.  The author also talks about supporting one's husband.  How about the husband supporting his wife's career?  It works both ways and spousal support is not just \\"one\\" way.  Have I stepped back into the 50's here?  Satan is also mentioned in her book, which, in my review of the Prayer of Jabez, is getting old.  We have free will, which God has given us.  Our choices need to be held accountable by the person who made them and not blamed on someone else.<br />She also makes reference that we have to realize that Jesus died for payment our sins and once we accept that we are saved.  I think not.  God's Spirit is with us always and if one does or does not accept the above statement, it does not mean that God will not bless us.  We are God's expression on earth.  We are already whole and complete and we are loved always.  I am really tired of reading \\"Christian\\" books where the guilt it constantly laid on.  This book also does not talk about a forgiving and loving God, which is very disappointing.<br />She also talks ad nauseum on fear, on women's fears.  Sure we all have fears, but again we either give into them or change them.  It makes me wonder that as a minister's wife, she is so filled with fear, where is her supportative husband?  Does she feel that insecure?  Has her husband not helped to boost her self-confidence or has she been put down and made to feel insecure.  Makes one wonder.<br />This book was just as bad as the original, if not worse.  Another disappointment.hristian\\" books where the guilt it constantly laid on.

The Tin Forest is recommended for readers from 4-8, but this book, to me, is a wonderful book for all ages.  The story teaches the lesson of hanging onto one's dream, of not letting it go, of nourishing it, tending to it, until it indeed sprouts leaves and blossoms into a life of its own.  The old man constantly held onto his dream, and never gave up what he wanted to achieve.  He had hope and that hope spurred him on.  The forest he constantly dreamed of became a reality.<br />He lived in forgotten place, where he was surrounded by trash and objects that others once wanted, but no longer did.  He tirelessly cleared away the trash, organized it, and dreamed at night of his forest with wild animals and lush flowers.  One day, the idea came to him of making his own forest, if one was not going to spout up amidst all of the garbage.  He made a forest of \\"things\\", a forest of tin, fashioned only after his own imagination and the books he devoured each night.  He made trees, and flowers, and plants and the wild creatures that would inhabit his forest.  Then one day, a visitor arrived in the form of a colorful bird, eating the crumbs the old man gave him, and singing his thanks back to the man.  Sadly, the bird left the next morning, which left the old man very lonely.<br />Yet, the next day, the old man awoke to the melody of his visitor and his mate.  They brought seeds to plant and decided to make their home here, in the tin forest.  Soon, green shoots sprouted, flowers bloomed and various wild animals came to the forest to make their home.  . . . \\"And in the house lived an old man who never stopped dreaming.\\"<br />This book is just precious and the illustrations are just as wonderful and precious.  I absolutely LOVED this book!  A wonderful tale of teaching children that nothing is beyond their grasp.<br />\\"There was once a wide, windswept place . . . . but where there is a dream, hope can grow.\\"	2002-05-30

Where Miracles Happen is a wonderful book, which will warm your heart, bring tears to your eyes and leave you with such a warm feeling all over!  Ms. Anderson has managed once again, to capture the essence of the miraculous in everyday life.  With over 50 different accounts of true encounters with heavenly beings, one knows that God loves us, we are watched over, protected, and guided constantly throughout our lives.  Sometimes, as shown by several of the stories, our deceased loved ones are with us and also watching over us.<br />Help is always available, one just has to ask for it, as the story illustrated of the mother who did not have enough money to feed her children and food miraculously appeared, or the child caught in the snowstorm and could not find her way home, yet was guided by a supposed neighbor, who was later found out to be sick that entire week, or the gentleman who was protected driving when his mother invoked safety prayers from him and avoided a collision where a dozen cars lost control, yet no one was injured.<br />There are also stories of healings and of our loved ones sending signs and messages to reassure us that they are indeed in a place of love and that they are indeed all right.  It seems that their messages and signs bring such healing and release to those that they have left behind.<br />These stories will inspire you and lift you up if you are feeling blue.  Sometimes we need gentle reminders from above, that we are loved and cherished and not forgotten, even though we ourselves may think so.<br />I love keeping Ms. Anderson's books near by and randomly opening them and reading passages after a long and particularly stressful day!  I would also encourage anyone to check out Ms. Anderson's website, where one can subscribe to a true angel story of the week!<br />This book would be great comfort to anyone who has lost a loved one, as well as to those who are experiencing turmoil in their lives.  The title of the book does indeed live up to its name and the miracles presented in this book are phenomenal!<br />Highly recommended!!up to its name and the miracles presented in this book are phenomenal!<br />Highly recommended!!	2002-05-30

Adorned in black and white, Tice depicts wonderful images of America, with a few images of Yorkshire and Esonia as well.  Time seems to stand still in the photos, and one can just gaze and ponder and get lost.  Another aspect of his work, which really appeals to me, was that I wanted to reach out and touch almost all of the photos.  The texture contained in most of the photos, is just incredible.<br />The majority of the photos were shot in his native state of New Jersey, and one can get a feel for the complexity of the images presented, from the bounty of nature to the scenes of industrialism.  Tice seems to capture the essence of the people he photographs, as well as showing us the beauty in nature and all around us.<br />A wonderful collection of glimpses of different parts of America from 1953 to 1999.  A little gem of a book!	2002-05-27

The back of the book led one to believe one thing and the story actually led you somewhere else.<br />Anna Bolles has not come to terms with her MS and meets Joe Malone, a very successful businessman and photographer.  In Joe's presence, Anna's doubts, trepidations, and insecurities seem to surface, along with her denial of her MS.  Joe obviously can handle her condition, but Anna \\"just cannot put him through all of the complications\\" and breaks off the relationship.  Joe is absolutely devastated, cannot make Anna change her mind and honors her request.  Anna finally comes to her senses months later and contacts Joe and asks for another chance.<br />I found the book to be very contrite, the characters shallow at times, and the story line to drag.  Joe Malone's character was not developed at all, and the reader hardly gets to know who he is.  He hides behind his questions to Anna.  After finishing the story, I still did not know very much about him and was left hanging.  Anna is too busy denying her MS to comprehend what a life-long relationship with Joe would be like, even though he tells her that he can handle her MS.  Anna seems to dwell too much on her disability and cannot comprehend or realize the gift that has been presented to her in the form of Joe Malone.<br />A disappointing read.	2002-05-27

The accompanying book makes it very clear that this is not a tool for telling the future, but \\"offering insights into your own life and the events surrounding you\\".  The deck contains 33 sacred animal cards relating in the \\"Druid tradition\\".  The cards are big and beautifully illustrated.  The book not only explains each card, but also goes into the detail of the Celtic tradition of the animal.<br />The introduction explains Druid traditions and connecting with the spirit of the animals, who are also our teachers.  Native Americanism and Shamanism are also incorporated throughout the book, as these cultures also worked very closely with the animal spirits and learned to revere the animal spirits for daily guidance and healing.  The book does explain quite nicely the difference between power animals and totems and inner guides.  The last chapter of the book explains in great depth and detail on how to use the cards and to perform different spreads.<br />I found the cards quite powerful and found the messages imparted very timely and incredibly empowering.  I would highly recommend this deck and book for anyone looking to connect to the wisdom and advice of the animal spirits.  I found it to be on par with the Medicine Cards of Jamie Sams and David Carlson - both equally powerful and empowering, but this deck concentrates on the lore and wisdom of the Druids.<br />Highly recommended!...	2002-05-21

They want blue pearls for the blue dress and need to find out from the great oysters if this is possible for them to do.  The head angel visits the great oysters and finds out that it is impossible for them to make blue pearls.  She then confronts \\"the higher power\\" who tells her that it is indeed possible.  She only needs to listen to her heart for the answer.  She then flies back to the land of the great oysters and follows the sound of beautiful singing that she hears.  She finds the small oysters circling their smallest member, who is joyfully singing amid a halo of blue light.  The head angel tells the smallest oysters that they will produce the blue pearls, which will adorn the blue dress.<br />Elise must leave her three small children soon, as she knows her time is almost completed on earth.  She teaches and loves them the best that she can and imparts the wisdom to them that the only important thing on earth \\"is loving and being loved\\".  Material goods are not what is truely important,  . . . but that love is. ...<br />The illustrations by Veronique Giarrusso are most bright, colorful, and beautiful.  The author also has also written an addendum at the end of the story explaining how this story came to be inspired and written.<br />This book would be a wonderful story to read to young children (3-8), if they know that one of their parents will soon leave them to be with God and the angels.  The story is loving, tender, and patient and the pictures will soothe any of their fears.<br />I loved this book and highly recommend it!	2002-05-21

Instead, this book is light, airy, hilarious, and pokes great fun at how most of America runs around crazy during the holiday season.  I really liked this book, could not put it down, and found myself laughing at the antics of Luther and Nora Krank as well as their delightfully intruding close-knit neighbors on Hemlock Drive.<br />With their daughter graduating from college and leaving to spend a year in Peru with the Peace Corps, Luther and Nora decide not to celebrate Christmas this year.  Instead, they decide to take the money that they would normally spend on all the trimmings and take a Caribbean cruise.  That means no tree, no card, no present, no office parties, no decorations, no donations, and no annual home party.<br />Word quickly spreads throughout this small town that the Krank's are not celebrating Christmas and will not be participating in the neighborhood or town festivities.  Instead their time is spent in tanning booths in preparation for the hot Caribbean sun.  The neighbors harass them every chance they get and picket signs even appear on their front lawn.  The neighborhood blames them for not winning the annual \\"best decorated street contest\\", as theirs is the only house not decorated!<br />On Christmas Eve, the Krank's get a surprise call from their daughter that she will indeed being coming home for Christmas and will be there in six hours.

My only complaint is that the book was not longer!!<br />This book will touch your heart and leave you feeling uplifted.  It is also a great book to open and read when one is feeling down and blue!  What I found remarkable in most of the stories, was when the children were in a situation where they felt compromised or felt that they were going to be harmed, they remembered their parents saying to them to call on either God or the angels to help them.  Once they invoked this petition, help was swift and sure.  One cannot help but come away with feelings of amazement and total wonder and knowing that we truly are loved.<br />A book to pass on and on!!!	2002-05-17

I have adored the \\"Max\\" series by Rosemary Wells for quite sometime, as my three children absolutely loved all the Max books when they were younger.  Ms. Wells manages to capture really great nuances on the faces of both Max and his sister Ruby, as well as presenting the most humorous situations for Max and Ruby.<br />Max wants nothing but a dragon shirt and Ruby is insisting on buying him a much-needed pair of pants, per the instructions of their mother.  Max does not give up on his beloved dragon shirt and reminds Ruby every chance he gets.  Ruby gets sidetracked in the store trying on dresses and Max manages to wander in the store after dozing off and not finding Ruby in the dressing room.  Max finds his coveted dragon shirt, puts it on and is \\"found\\" by two policemen in the store.  Well, now the dragon shirt is covered with yummy ice cream and Ruby has no choice but to purchase the shirt for Max!<br />The illustrations and use of color will delight any youngster, as will the antics of Ruby and Max!  I love their facial expressions and even after all of these years, I still love reading these books!  This was one series of book that neither I, nor my children, ever tired of reading.  I find the Max and Ruby books just really classic books!  My children would read them over and over again and would find them first with every library visit!<br />Absolutely pure delight!!!	2002-05-01

We follow Robert from his first day in school in Kindergarten to throughout his entire life! Robert beams with pride when the teacher first gives him a problem to solve and he solves it correctly.  Yet as Robert matures, the problems keep coming, some easy and some not so easy.  Some he can't wait to solve, while others he would prefer for them to go away so that he does not have to solve them.  We all have had problems like that!!<br />Robert perseveres and continues to solve the problems that come his way and discovers that problems still need to be solved when formal school is over and the school of life takes over full time.  Robert loved learning and thus he loved solving the problems that his teacher and life gave to him.  Robert learns that problems cannot be ignored, as they just create bigger and more problems!  Robert also learned that only he could solve his problems, and that no one else could do it for him.  His family and friends supported and encouraged him and had patience with him when he would encounter a particularly \\"tough\\" problem.<br />As Robert matures and weathers time, he finally realizes that ALL of the lessons that he had been learning and all of the problems that he had been solving all had a common theme interwoven into them, and that life was teaching him the greatest lesson of all - how to love.  Decisions based in love and not in anger or hatred are the correct decisions for Robert to make.<br />This book will delight all who read it and it would be a most wonderful book to incorporate into a school curriculum.  This fable is short and wonderfully portrayed, and the drawings of Kathleen Peterson lend a charming quality to the book.<br />Highly recommended!!!	2002-04-09

Composed of five delightful tales, children will be delighted at the antics of owl and his misunderstandings!<br />In the story, The Guest, Owl invites winter into his home with all of her fury!  Snow is everywhere and his pea soup becomes frozen.  Shooing winter out the door, winter closes the door with a bang and Owl settles down once his fire is lit and warmth seeps back into this home.  His soup thaws and Owl is once again contented!<br />Strange Bumps is hysterical as Owl tries to figure out why there are two bumps at the end of his bed, under his covers!  Owls gyrations under the bed and under the covers are guaranteed to bring many laughs!  Owl cannot figure out where they came from or why they will not leave.  He finally settles into his easy chair in front of the fire to get a good nights sleep!<br />Tear-Water Tea is delightful as we see Owl cooking is favorite tear-water tea with his own tears.  He thinks of all the sad things he can, such as mornings nobody saw because everybody was sleeping and pencils that are too short to use.  Filling up his kettle with his tears, he is ready to enjoy his favorite tea!  A tad bit salty for me though.<br />Upstairs and Downstairs depicts Owl running up and down his stairs to check on how the upstairs is doing and how the downstairs is doing.  Owl does this all day long and into the evening and he discovers how tired he is and he cannot be in two places at once!<br />Owl and the Moon is a cute tale of Owl befriending the Moon.  Owl knows that the Moon cannot fit through his door, and it saddens him that the Moon, his friend, cannot come into his house.  Getting ready for bed, Owl notices that Moon is shining outside and has indeed followed him home.  Going to sleep, Owl is no longer sad, as his friend is right outside his door.<br />Another wonderful Lobel, which is sure to delight and please readers young and old alike!  I wish that Lobel had written more books on Owl!!more books on Owl!!	2002-04-09

This is a work of fiction, of Dr. Peck's \\"imaginary\\" version of what he thinks the afterlife could be like.  I find it hard to objective for the review of this book, as I have read so many books on NDE's and OBE's, that when I finished reading this book, it paled in comparison to the other books that I have read.<br />Dr. Peck's story revolves around Dr. Daniel Turpin, a psychiatrist, who lies dying from lung cancer with his two children around him.  Daniel is able to feel himself leave his body and knows that he has died.  While in \\"heaven\\" Daniel encounters other spirits, some in purgatory and some in hell.  The allegorical \\"hell\\" was quite amusing for those souls depicted living in the bottom of trash can, working for Amalgamated Systems!!  Daniel is also able to go back to earth to \\"check-up\\" on his children and to visit his former residence that he once shared with his beloved wife.  Greeters help Daniel with his adjustment to the afterlife and he learns that he cannot interfere with earthly doings, yet he does have freedom of choice.<br />We experience Daniel's partial review of his life and his thirst to serve God.  The Greeters inform Daniel that there are many committees in heaven, if he so wishes to serve.  As Daniel comes to terms with the afterlife and his comfort level takes him out of his paradigm, he becomes adventurous and wants to see and experience more.<br />Even though this is a novel, with all of the information in print and in video of true experiences of the afterlife, this story seemed almost \\"clinical\\" to me.  It was a very simple story, not at all colorful, and at times boring.  Also, when Dr. Peck described Daniel meeting his wife and another son, those meetings, to me, were portrayed as cold, and not at all loving or warm.  This lack of love and warmth really bothered me.  Dr. Peck's allegorical view was very different, yet he does leave the reader thinking and asking questions.  I think also, that readers have to keep in mind that this is a work of fiction.<br />Dr. Peck does portray love and compassion in the afterlife, with Greeters and others who do assist those souls who are having a hard time adjusting.  The patience and love do shine through from those assisting.<br />This is one of those books where one will either really like it or they won't.  It is not a terrible book, just very different with a lack of warmth.the reader thinking and asking questions.

For any 1st to 3rd grader learning to read, this book will allow the child to feel confident and very successful!<br />Four stories are presented by the mouse, who was captured by the weasel for his mouse soup.  The mouse tells the weasel that his soup will not taste good unless he puts stories into the soup.  One plain old mouse will not a soup make!  The stories are:  Bees and the Mud, Two Large Stones, The Crickets, and The Thorn Bush.  After the mouse has finished his delightful stories, the weasel cannot comprehend how he will get the stories into the soup!  Mouse instructs him to find a nest of bees, two large stones, some crickets, and a thorn bush.  Not being very smart, weasel dashes out of the house to find the items, which allows  mouse to escape to the warmth and comfort of his home, to eat a great meal and to finish reading his book!<br />The stories told by mouse are entertaining, lively and a hoot!  They will keep the little reader guessing and wanting to know what is going to happen!  The illustrations are entertaining and really help to contribute to the charm of the story!<br />A true delight!  I love Arnold Lobels books for children!!	2002-04-09

I picked up Fire and Rain at my local library, as amazon.com indicated that this was an out of print book.  If you are a Diane Chamberlain fan, as I am, and if you have not read this book, I strongly recommend that you do!  You will not be disappointed!  Chamberlain has provided yet, another suspenseful, romantic, cannot-put-down tale, which leaves her readers in suspense until the very end!  The book draws you in, immerses you into the lives of all of the characters, and you feel so very much part of the entire scenario.  Chamberlain has the talent of awakening the reader's senses and making them fully present.  One feels like they are really in the town of Valle Rosa.<br />Jeff Cabrio arrives in Valle Rosa with the promise of being able to bring the much needed rains and to stop the fires from destroying the homes and eventually the entire town.  Carmen Perez, the ex-wife of the mayor, is desperately trying to revitalize her dying journalistic career and thinks that by doing an expose on Jeff Cabrio is the only way to do it as well as this being her last chance to prove herself.  But in the investigation of Cabrio, Perez is confronted with the ghosts of her past and knows that she can no longer run from her past pains and problems and must, indeed confront and deal with the demons.  Mia Tanner has her own secrets, which she desperately wants to hide from Jeff Cabrio, but realizes as she is falling in love with him, that they cannot stay hidden any longer either.  Jeff Cabrio does indeed have a most painful past, and has done everything possible to run and hide from this past, as well as his identity.  But will his love for Mia allow him to reveal the truth even to her and do what he must do, to finally have peace in his life?  Meanwhile, the pressure is on Cabrio to bring forth the rain he has promised to save the village.  With the media constantly keeping the pressure on him, Cabrio is not dealing with much more pressure than he ever dreamed of.<br />The suspense will keep the reader guessing on how all the pieces will come together and who will do what and when!!!  This book is classic Chamberlain where the unexpected does indeed happen!!  The suspense is wound around several of the character's painful pasts, allowing love in to heal them and putting the past behind once and for all, and looking toward the future.<br />I highly recommend this book and for this reviewer - she stayed up until 4 in the morning until she finished the book!!!

I found this book to be quite helpful in preparation for designing a website.  Since the website I am designing is strictly informational in nature, I learned many new concepts not only about the basics of a good informational site, but also about the &#147;cruising&#148; habits of web readers.<br />The book is a quick read and I took many notes, but the important thing that I gleaned from this book was how to make my site informational, easy to navigate through and what works and does not work as far as design and color are concerned.  As a cruiser myself, I know what bores me, irritates me, frustrates ma and what appeals to me when I am on a mission to find information and when I want to find it fast.  The information contained in this little was quite valuable in that regard.<br />This is NOT a book about design and the use of color, etc., but instead a book about making a site usable to the &#147;cruiser&#148; and then giving you, the reader, the information on how to attract users to your site, so that they won&#146;t get irritated or frustrated.  Admit it, we all have been to those sites!!<br />I think one might be surprised when reading this book, that color, tons of pictures and graphics are not key elements in an informational website, and our preconceived notions will quickly be laid to rest!<br />Very good book for a &#147;newbie&#148; starting out on the road to web-design as well as seasoned designers.	2002-04-02

The Modern Magi, A Christmas Fable, is a most wonderful, delightful little book, on living the true meaning of Christmas, the whole year through.  Carol Lynn Pearson brings home this meaning poignantly, simply, and beautifully through the character of Annabelle Perkins.  Annabelle will touch your heart and maybe even spur you on, to perform your own selfless Christmas miracle.  Even though the ending was predictable early on, this, in no way whatsoever, detracted from the beauty of the fable.<br />God talks to us constantly, yet one just has to be still and listen, have faith and follow what that inner voice is guiding us to do.  Annabelle heard God speaking to her and she followed her heart and performed miracles for others while on earth.  Was she an angel or a messenger or both?  Only you the reader can decide that.<br />Annabelle's good will was able to live on long after Annabelle left earth and that is what the message of the book was portraying.<br />This little fable will warm you, bring tears to your eyes and remind you once again, that God does indeed work in mysterious ways though many people who touch our lives.<br />A wonderful book to share with the entire family!!!  I loved it!!	2002-03-30

Andrew Greeley has written a magical tale of love, keeping in tune with the Christmas spirit.  Greeley is one of my all time favorite authors, and I have yet to read one of his books, which has not captivated me and given me food for thought.<br />The reader will find this heartwarming a tale a quick read, as the reader is held in suspense until the very end.  Greeley weaves his wit, charm and mystical musings into the romantic tale of Jack, an Irish Catholic lad meeting a beautiful Russian college student at Harvard.  Odessa, a bit of a Russian mystic, weaves her own kind of magic with everyone who comes into her presence.  Her charming and innocent ways at looking at life incorporate the mystical and spirituality of her culture.<br />Jack decides to bring Odessa home to Chicago to meet his family for Christmas.  With her simplicity, innocence, charm, and grace, Odessa manages to mend the uptight Flanigan family and bring them closer together than anyone thought was possible!<br />This is a wonderful tale and helps to bring home the message that people come into our lives for a reason, as God reveals him/her self to us in those that we meet.<br />Another uplifting winner from Farther Andrew Greeley!	2002-03-18

Rice has the endearing quality of drawing the reader right into the world she is portraying and making the reader one of the family.  One cannot help but become intensely involved with the character's lives.  Rice also paints a realistic picture for the reader, and not some made-up fantasy world, where one cannot really relate to the experiences that they are reading about.<br />Rice does a wonderful job portraying the deep bond of two sisters and the aftermath of Dana having to raise her sister, Lily's children, after her and her husband's untimely death.  Family issues arise, centered on Lily's two girls, Quinn and Allie, and once again Rice portrays the intense emotions from the entire family, so that the reader can feel them and experience them.  Throwing a bit of mystery into the untimely deaths, the reader is left wondering for a long time just exactly what is up.<br />The themes of Rice's books seem to center around the family unit and how each member copes when tragedy enters into their lives.  Yet it is done poignantly and with depth and sensitivity, that the reader is left with a renewed sense of hope, and that love can and will prevail.  The romance angle woven into this story is not overwhelming or intoxicating, but has just the right dose of sweetness so that the reader is rooting for Sam and urging him to never give up on Dana!  The reader comes to know the characters so intimately, that one cannot wait to get to the next chapter!<br />I found this story to be endearing and touching and it is classic Rice at her best! Rice fans will not be disappointed, and I found this book to be one of her best!	2002-03-14

This little gem of a book is indeed, a very quick read, but the insightful quotes will leave you feeling uplifted and recharged!  The written contents were originally written as a commemorative speech, so those looking for  \\"more\\" in whatever capacity, will not find it.  I found the book to be insightful words of wisdom for graduating seniors, entering the reality of the \\"real world\\", yet Quindlen speaks of what is truly \\"real\\" as compared to what is forced upon us as real at that tender young and impressionable age.<br />Quindlen speaks of  \\"getting a life.  A real life, a full life...\\"  \\"Learn to be happy.  And, think of life as a terminal illness, because, if you do, you will live it with joy and passion, as it ought to be lived.\\"  I believe that her words have more relevant meaning today, after what we, as a country, have been though recently.  As John Lennon said, \\"Life is what happens to you while you are busy making other plans.\\"<br />This books speaks to one's heart and the things that are truly important, meaningful and heart-felt, when all else fails.<br />The wonderful quotes are too numerous to mention, but well worth the effort of writing your favorites ones down and hanging them up to remind you to live your life with meaning, depth and joy.<br />I loved this simple, yet remarkably profound book.  It is a gem, very much wanting to be shared with those that you love!	2002-01-06

I have never traveled to Finland, but after reading this book, one will feel like they have journeyed there many times!  The author beautifully portrays the simple yet elegant Finnish living designs and also brings the reader though the seasons in order to experience a more up close and personal Finland.  The pictures are beautiful, bright, and do help the reader to have more of a \\"feel\\" of the land and people of Finland.<br /> \\"The house is like its master\\", states a  Finnish Proverb, which greets the reader at the beginning of the book.  Gaynor depicts Finland to the reader in both black and white and incredibly vivid color.  Her narratives throughout the book are wonderful and one will feel that they are totally immersed into the experience of touring the countryside with the author!  The richness of the people, portrayed through their simplistic lifestyle, is very much evident.<br />The reader is also bought into the design of the exterior of the buildings and I loved the pictures of all the different doorways!  The taste of the architectural adventure and history is a treat!  Sources are also listed at the back of the book if one wishes to purchase Finnish furniture or accessories.<br />I heartily recommend this book, whether one is contemplating a trip to this Nordic country, or whether one has a fascination for the culture and experience of Finland.  This book will easily feed your fascination as you cannot help but devour chapter after chapter!  The photographer, Kari Haavisto, is also to be commended for the beauty of the land as seen through her eyes.  The reader will definitely walk away with a more revered perspective for the people, their land, and their lifestyle.	2002-01-06

Secret Lives is the fourth book by Diane Chamberlain that I have read, and the books just seem to get better and better!  Eden Riley, a much sought after actress has decided to make a movie about her famous mother, Katherine Swift, an author of children stories.  Eden's mother died when Eden was young and she hardly knew her mother, yet Eden heard all kind of stories about her.  Eden comes back to the family \\"homestead\\" in the Shenandoah Valley, moves in with her uncle Kyle and his wife, and is presented with numerous journals by her uncle, which her mother wrote throughout her life.<br />Eden comes to discover that things are not what they appear to be, as she discovers her mother for the first time.  Secrets are revealed, truths uncovered, not only about herself, but about her entire \\"family\\" as well.  While seeking the truth, Eden comes to trust and rely on her uncle's colleague, Ben Alexander, and eventually realizes the love that has been missing in her life.  Yet, Ben is also hiding a secret, which could eventually be disastrous to Eden, to her career and to her child as well.<br />Chamberlain weaves suspense, mystery, adventure, and romance all into one page-turner!  As always, her ending will surprise the reader and have one asking where one missed the clues!!  The story line is intense, yet the characters are powerful, can stand on their own and are able to draw the reader into their lives.<br />Another great story by Chamberlain!	2001-11-29

I live in the Annapolis area, which made the book even more interesting to me, as Chamberlain describes the scenes downtown near the waterfront.<br />This is a story of a Susanna, a single mother's fight for her only child as she looses custody to her ex-husband and his new, child hungry, unable-to-bear-children wife.  Unfortunately, the theme is all too relevant today in our society, with courts awarding custody not to the parent who can provide the most loving, stable, and balanced home, but instead to the parent to has the most money and can \\"buy\\" the child.  I could relate to Susanna totally and could not condone her actions, nor can any other mother reading this book!  The reader is able to feel her terror and fear as she formulates her plan and carries it out.  Yet it is in the day-to-day activities, in which we feel Susanna's fear and her loss of Linc.  Susanna sacrifices her own happiness and her chance for love for her only child.<br />This book was similar to the other Chamberlain books I have read, in that there were a lot of little subplots going on, each a mystery in themselves!!  I thought that the characters showed depth, emotion, and portrayed a very real believable element in the plot.  Chamberlain writes of very strong female characters, who seem to push out of their paradigms and prove to themselves that they are capable, despite what family and society seems to say about them.<br />This book will keep you guessing to the very end and the ending once again, will take the reader completely back!  I love the way Chamberlain completely fools the reader at the end, when the reader thinks they have it all figured out!!  It is not what it appears to be!<br />Another good story from Chamberlain!	2001-11-29

I stared reading The Golden Compass on the recommendation of my thirteen-year-old daughter, and I must say, the book is absolutely wonderful!!  The ending of book one just has you grabbing for book two right away!!  I was a big fan of Tolkein and CS Lewis growing up, and to this day, I still enjoy those books, and this series will be taking their place alongside those classics.<br />I find that this book will not only appeal to the young adults, but more so to adults, who still have room in their lives for the mystery, magic and fantasy of life.  I do believe that adults will far more appreciate the subtle contrasts to mythology and theology.<br />As far as the negative reviews I have read, my opinion is to disregard them and read this book for what it is - pure imagination, creativity and fantasy as an absolutely wonderful tale, which just pulls you in deeper with each chapter.<br />Lyra, the protagonist, is an all-encompassing character, which has the reader cheering for her bravery, her ingenuity, her courage, and her love.  Pullman portrays a very strong female heroine, which will appeal to all of the young female readers.  Just when you think Lyra cannot do it, she pulls it off with all of her strength mustered to do it.  The aspect of everyone having their own \\"daemon\\" is fascinating and makes me think of the Native American shamans with their \\"power animals\\", along with shape shifting as well. The shamans and their power animals together heal and bring healing to those who seek his or her counsel.<br />Pullman's world in The Golden Compass can be compared to Milton's Paradise Lost or even to themes in Christianity, but to go and tear apart this book, based on the Christianity premise, is to miss the beauty and genius of this book.  The themes of good vs. evil, can be seen throughout the book in numerous instances - the witches, the armored bears, Mrs. Coulter and Lord Asriel.  Pullman's theme is older than time, and just relevant today as it was in Lyra's world.<br />It has been a long time in which I have read an \\"epic\\" novel, which transported me to another world, which was so believable.  Pullman's characters are believable, as are the personalities of their daemons and the world in which they all live.<br />I highly recommend this book for those adults who still believe in fantasy and of course the young teens will find this book highly charged, adventurous and an amazing adventure which will have them reading the other books in the series!  As for my daughter, she is now reading all of Pullman's books, which has now lead her to Tolkein.<br />I am onto book two!<br />Bravo Pullman!!!world.<br />It has been a long time in which I have read an \\"epic\\" novel, which transported me to another world, which was so believable.

Meeting Archangel Gabriel, they are told that they must perform three miracles by midnight of this Christmas Eve in order to earn their wings.  Don is skeptical and Cathy believes, as they are given their \\"list\\" of who they must help and what they can and cannot do back again on earth.  Gabriel also explains to them about people having faith against all odds, especially during this solemn time of the year.<br />&quot;Little Miracles.  Christmas gifts.  Making something work out for people who just keep trying and believing against all odds.  That is a miracle, you see.  When all facts and figures suggest that something just can't happen - but it does.  When faith makes something happen.&quot;<br />The people Don and Cathy encounter and help are struggling with issues and situations that are not uncommon or difficult in our lives today.  Pozzessere combines touches of humor along with sentimentality as her \\"angels\\" struggle to accomplish their mission before midnight.<br />&quot;Life - on Earth - only lasts so long for any man, woman, and child.  It's a gift, like any other.  And quite fleeting at the very best, against the spectrum of time.  But there is a quality to every man's life.  Life is a gift to be used to the fullest, no matter how the days are measured.  Perhaps life itself is the greatest gift, but sometime it takes a miracle to make people see that.&quot;<br />This book is easy to read and the touches of humor are quite enjoyable in the realm of performing Christmas miracles.  The ending will surprise you as well as bring tears to your eyes.  Christmas is a time of miracles, but it is also a time of love, as Pozzessere so eloquently shows us.  This would be a great book for the entire family to read during the holiday season!	2001-11-29
US	52853018	R1AKWQ61XA2IM8	0553573209	904561240	Firefly Beach	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Another great love story!	Firefly Beach by Luanne Rice is one of her best books yet.  I have read all but three of her books, and with each new book I read, I come to endear Rice as one of my favorite authors.  Her books are incredibly sensitive, the characters are so real and believable, and she writes from her heart.  Her writings seem to center on family issues that one can relate to at one time or another.  Rice lets us know that love can heal, prevail and make things right.<br />Caroline Renwick knows the secret of Joe Connor's father's untimely death when he was only six.  Yet Caroline befriends him at a young age and their relationship grows deeper through their letters to each other.  That is, until Joe discovers the truth of his father's death, and at seventeen and blames Caroline for not telling him the truth, and cuts her out of his life.<br />Years later, Joe comes back into Caroline's life, back to Firefly beach to see for himself where the death occurred, and to find some more answers.  Now a grown woman, Caroline, remains the main support for her mother and two sisters, as they all must confront those demons and deal with them, as well as the arrival of Joe Connor.<br />With grace and style, Luanne Rice portrays a dysfunctional family whose yearnings to heal are marred by more challenges and confrontations.  With Joe's help, Caroline is able to listen to her heart and to her longings and in the process helps her own family to find the strength to heal and to love again.<br />This was another could not put down book, and Ms. Rice writes with the same sensitivity that I have come to admire in her previous books.  A very endearing love story - I highly recommend it!	2001-10-27

I found that I could not put down the book and needed to finish it before anything else got done!  Chamberlain weaves her story with such precision, that one thinks that they know the ending, but WHAM - a surprise is in store for the reader.  The suspense skillfully draws the reader in and does not let go until the very end.<br />I am finding that \\"secrets\\" prevail in her books, and they are not revealed until the end, but the reader is kept in suspense until the very last possible moment!  Chamberlain combines romance, mystery, thrills and issues of family all interwoven and cleverly revealing.<br />The main character, Janine, is incredibly strong, a maverick, who comes into her own despite her overbearing ex-husband and equally over-bearing and controlling parents.  Janine meets Lucas, who shows her how to blossom and to become her own person, and to stop the \\"puppet\\" like behavior she has come to know.  Lucas believes in her decision to start an alternative treatment for her daughter, against the wishes of both her ex-husband and her parents.<br /><br />The story will appeal to both men and women, and the suspense of not knowing if Sophie, Janine's critically ill 8-year old daughter, will be found, will have the reader hanging onto every page!<br />The story was every endearing, courageous and filled with the miracle of love conquering all.<br />I highly recommend this book and am most anxious to read all of her previous books!	2001-10-27

But he outshines himself in his incredible love story, Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas.  I cried and then I cried some more.  This book is based on fact from Patterson's own life and the story is so incredibly beautifully written.  His action seeking fans, mostly men, will not find the Alex Cross kill `em action here.  Instead one will find tenderness and softness beyond words.  It has to be one of the best love stories that I have ever read and I am a die hard Alex Cross fan as well.<br />I finished this book in one day and wanted more.  I wanted to know the sequel.  I did not want it to end.  I was totally amazed at the depth of love that Matt and Suzanne lived and breathed.  I think we all want to find that depth of romance and happiness.<br />Patterson shows us a love so profound, and hope as well, that that kind of love will enter into our own lives.  \\"It's about how good it can be if you find the right person.  It's about treasuring every moment with that special one.  Every single millisecond.\\"<br />I love this book - I cannot say enough good things about it and everyone that I have recommended it to have loved it as well. Five stars does not do it justice at all.<br />It is definitely a story to treasure, a keeper for the favorite shelf, and a reminder that true love does exist.<br />If you read one romance book this year - make it this one - you will not be disappointed, but make sure you have a box of Kleenex handy!	2001-10-27

I did not read these books in order, but that has not detracted from the flow of any of the books.  Since I have read the other books first, and the first book last, Detective Alex Cross has changed somewhat into a mellower, more likeable character.  I did not see the movie, but had envisioned Denzel Washington to play the smooth and sophiscated Alex Cross and was disappointed in the choice of Morgan Freeman.  But after reading this book, Morgan Freeman fits Alex Cross in this book perfectly - for this book only!!!<br />I love Patterson's books and have read just about all of them.  I find them to be engrossing, suspenseful and I just can't put them down.  He foils me with the ending each and every time!!<br />In this book, Patterson has a serial killer at large, Gary Soneji, who has kidnapped two children, and who wants to be known as somebody. Jezzie Flannagan from the FBI, is also on the case, giving Cross support to capture the killer.  Three great strong main characters, exposed to the reader so as to get into their psyche, yet intertwined with each other to make for one incredible story.<br />The ending is a blow out, which is what I love about Patterson - hanging on to the edge of your seat with each and every page, and giving you the shocker at the end.  I love it!  His books are definite thrillers and shockers!	2001-09-22

I found myself swept immediately into the story; and was kept guessing and wondering how all the pieces were going to fit together. Chamberlain has numerous plots going on within this tale, but the reader will not become confused, only anxious to fit all the puzzle pieces together, if they can!  Chamberlain does a wonderful job of holding the reader in suspense and introducing the reader to multiple surprises not only at the end, but also during the course of the story.<br />Eleven-year-old Daria finds a baby on the beach on the morning of her birthday. Her family comes to adopt the baby, who they name Shelly, after no one claims the newborn. After the death of Daria's parents, Daria continues the role of caretaker for her sister, even at the expense of her own happiness. Suffering some brain damage after her birth, Daria is understandably very protective of Shelly.<br />Chamberlain leads the reader through the numerous families summering on the Outer Banks, and leaves you guessing as to who is Shelly's real mother. Nearly twenty years later, Shelly enlists the aid of one of the former residents, Rory Taylor, now a TV producer, to help her find her past. Rory starts asking too many questions, which has several of the residents becoming angry and asking him to leave well enough alone. Afterall, Shelly was raised in a loving and caring home.<br />The web of secrets leaves no one unscathed, as you will find out, yet Chamberlain masterfully weaves this intricate tale, blending everything into a cohesive, heartfelt, and warming tale. The ending will definitely surprise the reader!  I highly recommend this book.<br />I am very much looking forward to reading her other books.	2001-09-22

This book, however, would not be appropriate for the loss of a human life.  The author lets the reader know that it is OK to feel sad, to not want to watch TV, or to eat or to go outside and play.  But most important of all, that it is OK to cry and feel sad.<br />The mother and father hold a backyard funeral for Barney, the beloved deceased cat, and the little boy comes up with nine good things to say about Barney.  Afterwards, when they plant flowers, he can come up with the tenth good thing about Barney.<br />Older children will find this too babyish, I believe, but this book was perfect for my younger children when our beloved dog, Snowball died.  Our vet gave us this book, along with the Rainbow Bridge poem.  It was very comforting.<br />The book conveys that we have to honor the grieving and the questions of children as they mourn their beloved pet, whether it is a fish, a dog, a cow, a horse, or whatever pet is important to them.  The value of a ceremony is just as important for closure.<br />I highly recommend this tender book.	2001-09-17

This was a \\"could not\\" put down book and the author leads you through a maze, twisting and turning with each new occurring development.  The suspense carries you from chapter to chapter, and does not let you go until the very end.<br />Hepinstall's characters are strong and you find yourself cheering for 11-year old Alice, with her boldness, her quick wit, and her intelligence.  Her older brother Boone is forced to grow up rather quickly and one wonders if he is up to the challenge.  His character development gradually builds and the reader is left questioning on where his loyalties lie.  But Hepinstall's artistry cleverly weaves a web, leaving the reader to wonder how and why, and only at the end does one see all the pieces come so smoothly together.<br />The title is misleading, but after having finished the book, the title is perfect for the story!  Not only will the reader find suspense, and mystery, but also the realities of life that stay hidden away in most families.  Abuse in various forms, depression, lies, deceit, as well as portraits of a dysfunctional family.  Set in the late 60's, the author did a great job pulling all of these issues together in painting a portrait of a family in crisis, struggling, coping, and surviving.  The weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the children's mother, Meg, overshadow her rationality; yet, it is realistic.  We all have absences of nectar in our lives, but we are the only ones who can replace what is lost; as substitutes only last so long.<br />The ending is electrifying and riveting!  Again, please don't be mislead by the title, as in doing so, one will miss an incredible thriller.  I highly recommend this book and I guarantee that one will not be disappointed.<br />I now need to read her previous book!!	2001-09-15

I just purchased these amazing and beautiful cards.  The first reading I did was for my younger son and he was amazed at the message imparted to him.  I asked him if what I just told him made sense to him (he is almost 10), and with a huge smile on his face, he said, \\"Yes\\"!<br />The artwork is actually done by at least a half dozen artists, and their impressions of the fairy realm are wonderfully detailed, accurate and mesmerizing.  One can just stare and stare and come away filled with serenity and deep rooted peace.<br />I have Doreen's angel cards, and love those, but the fairies draw out the child in us and remind us to commune more with nature and with them.  For those of us who have always believed in the fairy realm, Doreen brings it out in the open and affirms for us their existence and credibility.  I just finished her book, Healing With The Fairies and was once again, swept away.  Powerful and amazing!<br />Let the magic and beauty of these cards and the fairies help heal those issues in your life, which are troubling you.  You will marvel and the messages imparted and your heart will be opened in wondrous ways.  Thanks Doreen for providing us with yet another tool for healing and happiness.	2001-09-15

This is definitely Rice at her best! It is romantic and sentimental, without being overbearing, with a touch of the mystical thrown in!<br />May Taylor is a single mother with a \\"gifted\\" daughter, who claims to speak with angels. While flying home to Connecticut, Kylie is warned of the impending aircraft danger by one of her angel friends, and seeks the aid of Martin Cartier to help her and her mother to safety. Not knowing why, Kylie knows that this man will somehow play a role in their lives. Cartier, a tough, kind, and greatly sought after bachelor, is a hockey player with the Boston Bruins. He pursues May until she agrees to marry him.<br />Rice once again weaves magic with her characters and one cannot help but fall right into their lives and into their emotions. Balancing issues of death, single parenthood, dual careers, scandal, parental issues, as well as hailing from two different countries, Rice brings home to her readers that any relationship requires commitment, work, dedication, honesty, and most of all love. I was endeared to this quote from the book, \\"That's what a married couple does . . .love each other through sickness and health, for richer, for poorer, in good times and bad. They love each other's children and try to honor each other's parents - even when the whole thing seems impossible.\\"<br />Their marriage is tested, challenged and tested again and Rice's portrayal of a family ripped apart by the trials of life and past events is uncannily real. I could not put this latest bestseller down and was completely swept away and into the saga. I absolutely loved this book and Rice confirms once again, that only love is real. This is one book that will touch your heart and warm your soul - a definite keeper.	2001-09-15

This is one of her earlier works and I have to say that her later books are so much better.  The reader immediately falls into the characters, the story, and one is really swept away with her later writings.  Not so with this book.  The book dragged, the conversations between characters were laborious and unexciting.  I found it very hard to follow the characters, much less even get into them.  I had to force myself to finish the book.<br />The family secrets and surprises kept me going, I suppose.  I wanted to find out what was really going on; otherwise I would not have bothered to finish the book.<br />Ms. Rice has most definitely improved with time and Cloud Nine, Dream Country, Summer Light and Follow The Stars Home are her later books in which you want to stay up all night to finish!  For those who are disappointed in this book, please dont let this discourage you  read her later books!!	2001-09-14

This is a very quick read and one can probably finish it in a couple of hours.  This is a very simple story, not very complicated, of one's man's quest for happiness and answers, in his seemingly hopeless and disparaging life.  While visiting Hawaii for a much-needed respite, he encounters two strangers who profoundly affect his life and leave him questioning and searching for answers.<br />So much is known today on the incredible power of the mind, yet in '83 this book was a precursor and the ideas presented here were probably just as startling to the reader.  Bernie Siegel and others have since paved the way, and mind-body books, seminars and tapes are now mainstreamed.  The messages of the power of the ego, living in the past with our mistakes and re-living them to keep us trapped, are eloquently presented so that the reader cannot miss the message and comprehend its powerful force in our lives.  The book also addresses the power that one's own fear can debilitate them.  \\"It is the thought that is the seed, the failure the form.  Without the thought it is virtually impossible to be a failure.\\"<br />There are gems contained within this simple story and the ending is amazing!  I have not read the sequel, but intend to do, to find out \\"what happens next\\"!  For some the messages will not be new and they will probably find the book so-so, but for others, this story will serve as a gentle reminder and help to open the door to expand one's paradigm.	2001-08-31

I admire Joan Wester Anderson's books and have reviewed several for amazon.com, and was I most surprised when I saw that she had penned a biography. I am too young to know anything about Loretta Young, but after reading this heartfelt book on this amazing woman, I too, became a fan and now need to see her movies!!! I have to disagree with a lot of the reviewers here and do not feel for one instant that Joan Wester Anderson had any kind of agenda or motive with her writing of this biography. I can see why Loretta Young choose Anderson, for I don't think that anyone else but Anderson, could have captured the true essence of Ms. Young, nor the beauty of her soul. The portrayal is sensitive, filled with beauty and inspiration, and portrays a remarkable woman, who refused to compromise her values. Ms Young not only walked her talk, she breathed and lived it on a daily basis. Her devotion to her faith and her spirituality was truly refreshing to read about. I think that the only other person in this day and age that could even come close would be Gloria Estafan. Ms. Young stood up for what she believed in, and in the process gathered many friends and admirers. Her closeness to her family was most touching and revealing to the kind of person she truly was. Anderson uses a quote from St. Basil in the book and this, I believe, sums up Ms. Young, \\"He who sows courtesy reaps friendship, and he who plants kindness gathers love.\\" Ms. Anderson portrays a woman whose beauty radiated from the inside out. I was touched by her generosity, which seemed to be unfailing and never ending. Her wanting to make a difference in this world, was constantly shown, believed in, and made into reality. Yet, Anderson also portrays an actress, a woman, who had struggles of her own in her life, fought the adversity with a deep faith and surmounted even the most difficulties.  No one is perfect; we all make mistakes, yet it is how we handle these challenges in our lives, which makes a difference. Ms. Young handled her challenges with her deep faith and love, which was a huge inspiration to me. In fact, this book was very inspirational to me and I came away with a deep respect for Ms. Young and I admire her immensely. There are wonderful messages to be gleaned from this story, and after reading the reviews here, I think that many people missed them entirely.  If one is looking to read a story on yet another \\"movie star\\" in the hopes of reading as much \\"dirt\\" about them as possible, one will not find it here. Anderson leaves the reader deeply moved about this truly classic lady, with a rare inner beauty, as well as outer beauty. This book came to me in my life where my challenges were being tested and I am learning, once again, to have the faith and to believe. Thank you Joan W.

This is a quick read - you will probably finish it in two hours or less, but it is packed with insight, honesty, humor, and its wisdom will touch your soul.  Walsh starts out by telling the reader that: \\"Relationship is the most important experience in our lives.  Without it, we are nothing.  Literally.\\"  Since we engage in so many different kinds of relationships, Walsch gently points out that,  \\"Being in a relationship has everything to do with what you choose to put into it, not what you can get out of it.\\"  Walsch has the reader looking at relationships from a higher perspective, and not a selfish one, and one will really stop and ponder, when reading and absorbing his words.  Walsch explains how relationships are sacred, as is our experiences of being in a relationship.  He says, \\"Love is a decision, not a reaction.\\"  After the infatuation wears off, what does one have left - A genuine relationship, or an empty example of instant gratification?<br />After finishing the book, I came away with saying, \\"Yes! - This is how it should be!\\"  Walsch makes several references to his relationship with his wife Nancy and how their relationship, empowers, builds, and creates, and does not limit, tear down or hurt the other person.  He asks the reader, \\" What can we empower?  What can we create?\\"  The reader has no choice, but to ask her/himself those very questions.  Is your relationship empowering you and allowing you to create the whole, possible you?  I really loved this quote, \\"Relationships that are based in real love - a love that is true - are relationships that are totally and completely free.  Freedom is the essence of love.  When we love another, we never seek to limit or restrict them in any why whatsoever.  Love does not limit, does not own, does not hold in, but expands, lets go, and releases, the grandest part of who all of us are.\\"<br />This book will open up your heart, your mind and your soul.  The words are pure and simple, but they aim right for your heart.  Your perspective will change, as will your desire for what your soul is seeking in a true relationship.  Walsch, in a subtle way, imparts to the reader, that one does not have to settle for second or third best.  The heart knows - one just has to listen, and one has to be secure in themselves, to not settle, and to only accept the highest calling of the heart.  For as Walsch says, \\"Relationship is the only experience in life that brings you an experience of yourself in life.  Not only do I know myself out of my relationship with you, but I literally define myself as well.  I can only see in me what I see in you\\".<br />Pretty powerful words - pretty powerful, heart-felt book.  I highly recommend this book for those who are seeking and for those that know, that there is something more powerful, sacred, and meaningful in a relationship and nothing else will do.re pure and simple, but they aim right for your heart.

I first encountered Neville on the recommendation of a Religious Science practitioner.  Since that time, I have read all of Nevilles books and all I can say is POWERFUL!  I re-read this book for the second time and it seems that the principles explained and put forth in this book really shined in their clarity this time around.<br />Neville says, Imagination is the gateway of reality.  As one reads this book, which one can be finish in one day, this idea of using ones imagination in the basis of reality is constantly honed into the reader.  Some may find his repetitive honing in of this concept too repetitive, but for me, this repetition was exactly what I needed to really grasp and truly understand the important concepts that Neville was trying to impart to the reader.  Neville clarifies his concepts with actual stories of people manifesting what they imagined.  Nevilles concepts are steeped in quotes from the Bible, not over done at all, which further illustrate and help the reader to grasp the concepts.  The abundant life that Christ promised us is ours to experience now, but not until we have the sense of Christ as our imagination can we experience it.<br />Neville teaches the reader to use ones imagination, with all of ones senses, to manifest that which they desire in reality.  Neville wants us to see it as fulfilled NOW, to act as if it were happening NOW and to abolish all negative thinking to the contrary.  One has to let go and know that it will happen and to not wonder how or why.  The mind is incredibly powerful, as Ernest Holmes, the founder of Science of Mind teaches: Change your thoughts, change your life.  Neville says, Man becomes what he imagines.  On both accounts  so very, very true!<br />The reviewer, who said that this book is not for Christians, has completely missed the entire thought and basis for this book.  This book is for everyone, as one must have the belief that, Spirit, Christ, God, or what ever name you want to use, is at the heart of all we want, imagine and manifest.  Imagination is Christ in man.  Neville points this out quite clearly and often, so that the reader can grasp this main and very important concept.  Neville urges the reader to think from the end  in other words, to imagine that what you want has come to pass.  To realize his ideal, man must first change the pattern which his imagination has followed.  The way to change the outer world is to make the inner speech and action match the outer speech and action of fulfilled desire.<br />I absolutely love this book and have highlighted and underlined most of the book!  This is a book that needs to be read more than once and referred to again and again.  It works  it truly works  but one has to step out of fear, know and have faith that it will happen and know that it comes from God, from Christ, from Spirit, from The One.  Inner speech mirrors imagination, and imagination is Christ.<br />This book is powerful, it is amazing and if followed, one *will* see miracles manifest in ones life.  The other books by Neville are just as powerful  The Power of Awareness, The Law and The Promise and Your Faith is Your Fortune, are my favorites.<br />This is the kind of book that will become worn and torn, as one constantly refers to it time and time again  it is a classic to be savored.ver name you want to use, is at the heart of all we want, imagine and manifest.

To realize his ideal, man must first change the pattern which his imagination has followed.   The way to change the outer world is to make the inner speech and action match the outer speech and action of fulfilled desire.<br />I absolutely love this book and have highlighted and underlined most of the book!  This is a book that needs to be read more than once and referred to again and again.  It works  it truly works  but one has to step out of fear, know and have faith that it will happen and know that it comes from God, from Christ, from Spirit, from The One.  Inner speech mirrors imagination, and imagination is Christ.<br />This book is powerful, it is amazing and if followed, one *will* see miracles manifest in ones life.  The other books by Neville are just as powerful  The Power of Awareness, The Law and The Promise and Your Faith is Your Fortune, are my favorites.<br />This is the kind of book that will become worn and torn, as one constantly refers to it time and time again  it is a classic to be savored.	2001-07-29

I could not put this book down and finished it in one day!  Lindsey Boxer, the main character of this thriller, is an Inspector with the San Francisco homicide department and, who finds herself with three bride and groom murders on her hands.  Leaving no visible clues at the murder scenes, Lindsey, her partner Chris Raleigh and the rest of the force, find themselves stumped over these senseless murders.  Enlisting the aid of three other women friends, they form the Woman's Murder Club, combine their resources and talents in the hopes of catching this maniacal killer.<br />Patterson, once again, has the reader hanging on to every chapter, tying to solve the mystery, only to be completely riveted at the every end - classic Patterson!!  With females as the central characters, Patterson deviates from his strong male, Alex Cross type characters.  The characters were not as developed as in his Alex Cross series, but nonetheless, I found these characters to be just as strong and able to hold their own.<br />As a Patterson fan, I found this book to be one of this best in that the ending was not only a mind-blower, but also a double whammy!  Without giving away the ending, one has to read the book to find out!<br />This reader is eagerly anticipating the next Patterson novel!	2001-07-29

If I could, I would rate this book with 10 stars.  Although one does not have to read his previous two books to read this book, he does make references throughout, but his explanations guide the reader and one is never confused or lost.  Many Lives, Many Masters and Through Time Into Healing are his previous two and both are as riveting as this book.  As with his other books, I could not put this book down either.  The messages imparted in this book are numerous for the deep connection of twin souls.  Weiss states, \\"Destiny dictates the meeting of soulmates.  We *will* meet them.  But what we decide to do after that meeting falls in the province of choice or free will.  A wrong choice or a missed chance can lead to incredible loneliness and suffering.  A right choice, an opportunity realized, can bring us to profound bliss and happiness.\\"<br />Weiss shares the story of two of his patients relating similar past lives, and he eventually connects the two and \\"intervenes\\" to introduce them.  I am sure we have all had the experience of meeting someone and just \\"knowing\\" that we know them on a much deeper level, but we can't explain it.  Those that come into our lives are either ready to meet their \\"other half\\" or as Weiss put it, they are \\"not awakened\\" yet.<br />Weiss speaks throughout the book on the meaning and value of love and indeed, \\"only love is real.\\"  He urges us to forget and forgive our past mistakes, to learn from them and move on - to live fully in the present and not to worry about the future.  This book is one incredible, beautiful lesson in love.  Weiss urges the reader to listen to one's heart, as the ego has other agendas, as do other people.  \\"There is someone special for everyone.\\"  How does one recognize a soulmate? - Weiss states it most profoundly, \\"When both recognize each other, no volcano could erupt with more passion.  The energy released is tremendous. Passion in a relationship cannot be artificially created . . . . . but the chemistry has to be there from the start.\\"  Oh how so very true!!!  \\"The person may not recognize the chemistry.  The attraction is definitely there but the source of chemistry is not understood.  It is delusional to believe that this passion, this soul recognition and attraction will be easily found again with another person.  You do not run into a soulmate every day . . .The more awakened a couple is, the more likelihood of a decision based on love.  When both partners are awakened, ecstasy is within their grasp.\\"<br />Weiss shares the past lives of both Elizabeth and Pedro and the reader is able to see them in different lifetimes, as different sexes, yet they are always together, learning soul lessons and coming back again and again to be together.  As with his previous books, messages come from Elizabeth under hypnosis, from \\"higher conscious masters\\", imparting loving and profound messages to Weiss: \\"Love dissolves fear.  You cannot be afraid when you are feeling love.  When allowed to flow freely, love overcomes all obstacles.\\"  Both of their past lives are most fascinating and the lessons learned are indeed enlightening.  I have used one of Weiss' past regression tapes and they are incredible and one can \\"see\\" as he states in the book.<br />Weiss also share with the reader, his own experiences with his soulmate and wife, Carol, and the \\"obstacles\\" that they had to over come.  \\"Destiny is persistent\\" as Weiss states and as seen in this book and as can be related in our lives, it doesn't give up - we only have to listen.<br />This book is fascinating, thought-provoking and my highlighter was in overtime in reading!!!  So many, many endearing and important thoughts on love and just being.  I have read all of Weiss' books and it is so hard to believe that they can get any better, but it is true!!!  Reading his books, one can experience a deep sense of healing and a profound infusion of love.  This isnot only a book about love, but also a book about  hope.  This is a \\"must have\\" have book and also one that you want to share with those in your life - \\"Listen to your heart, to your own intuitive wisdom when deciding about a gift of destiny, such as a soulmate.  Destiny will deposit its gift directly at your feet, but what you subsequently decide to do with the gift is up to you.  Your heart knows what you need.  Other people have other agendas.\\"<br />A most excellent book - I have read it three times already!is is not only a book about love, but also a book about  hope.

I found this \\"thriller\\" to be one of his best yet!  I was hanging onto every page and actually read this book in one day - I just could not put it down.  Dr. Alex Cross is confronted by solving two different murders - committed by two different murderers, yet both are baffling and both are \\"perfect\\".  The first killer is killing children in the neighborhood of his son's school and the second killer, known as Jack and Jill, are killing celebrities in the Washington, DC area.<br />Cross is then engaged by the White House to protect the President of the United States and his wife from the notorious Jack and Jill.  Cross has his hands full and his loyalties divided.  Can he do it?<br />What is so compelling about this story is that Patterson gets you into the mind of Jack and Jill and well as the child killer.  You feel all of their intense emotions and motivations for killing.  So, as the reader, you know the killer's next victim as well as knowing what Alex Cross is doing to get the killer.  Patterson has you in the mind of the cat as well as the mouse!  I love it!<br />I really love the character of Alex Cross and with each and every \\"Cross\\" book I read, I find Cross' character utterly fascinating.  Once again, Patterson has you guessing the \\"real\\" identity of all the killers and the end comes as a shocker!!  If you love shockers  - this book will have you floored, but then again, also read Roses Are Red by Patterson - that's a shocker as well!	2001-07-02

Detective Alex Cross shines again, as he relentlessly pursues east coast and west coast murders!  What was really fascinating was the concept of twinning in the aspect of committing murders.<br />As always, Patterson will have you hanging from chapter to chapter and just when you think you have it all figured out, something explosive occurs and you don't really know who the killer is until they very end! I am always stumped, but that is what makes reading his books so enjoyable!!<br />I really enjoy Alex Cross' character.  He is real and believable and Patterson gets the reader into Alex's mind and into the psychology of trying to figure out the killer!  This character is great and I am onto the next Alex Cross mystery!!<br />If you are a Patterson fan, as I am, this book will not disappoint!	2001-06-24

I guarantee that every woman who reads this books will see either herself, her mother or her daughter, or maybe even all three relationships in this heartfelt tale.  You will cry, you will laugh and then you will cry tears of joy - so keep that box of Kleenex handy!  I would love for my daughter, who is 12, to read this book when she is older and I am sure that there will be many other mothers out there who will be passing this book onto their daughters to read as well, or even vice versa!<br />As with all of Hannah's books, and I have read them all, her characters remain so true to life that once again the reader feels that they know each and every character personally and intimately.  Hannah draws you in from the very first chapter and never lets you go.  I found this book a bit different than her usual, &quot;romantic&quot; love stories, in that this story focused entirely on the relationship between Nora Bridge and her two daughters, Ruby and Caroline.  There was a romantic twist between Ruby and her childhood sweetheart, Dean, but this was a side bar, and was not the main focus of the book, although it was true to Hannah form!  Hannah fans will not be disappointed with this book, but if they are looking to read a pure romance book, this particular book will not fit the bill this time!<br />Hannah weaves stories that one can relate to on a personal and intimate level.  One can &quot;feel&quot; each and every emotion her characters are going through and through it all Hannah implants her message of love hope.  &quot;Sometimes people get hurt . . . It's never something you should seek out, or do on purpose, but you can't live a life that hurts no one. If you try, you'll end up touching no one.&quot;<br />A mother and daughter relationship is so complex, so tumultuous, so endearing and so precious.  We enter into so many phases with our beloved daughters, yet our hearts are forever bound to them and we only want for them all of the perfection in the mistakes that we have made.  Hannah divides this gap so that it is torn in two and with the beauty of a master craftsman, brings these wounded souls back together again with nothing but pure and simple love. A mother's love indeed knows no bounds.<br />Another winner from Hannah!!

US	52853018	RZ4564GB48GMX	0967978602	527787072	Jennie's Reprisal: A Soul's Evolution from Atlantis to Eternity	Books	5	37	37	N	N	Compelling, Amazing, Extraordinary &amp; Beautiful Tale	Jennie's Reprisal by Carol Bennett, is one of the most extraordinary books that I have read in a long time.  From the foreword, Ms. Bennett explains to the reader that this is indeed a true story, set in the form of a novel.  It is the story of one woman's journey or should I say &quot;one eternal soul's evolution through time.&quot;  During her nightly lucid dreams, Ms. Bennett assumed the soul of her Great Aunt, Jennie Gravatt, who passed in 1926.  Ms. Bennett's journeys as Jennie transversed Atlantis, Ancient Egypt, the Roman Empire, the Dark Ages, the Renaissance, the age of Enlightenment, as well as the Aquarian Age.  What is so fascinating, is that the reader is immediately pulled into Jennie's life as Ms. Bennett or is it Ms. Bennett's life as Jennie.  The author paints such an incredible sensory experience for the reader, that one can literally forget which century they are actually in, until reality jolts them back to the present!  One can feel the gamut of Jennie's happiness, her pain, her sorrow, as well as her sensuous yearnings for her beloved, in lifetime after lifetime.  One comes to know the intricies of Jennie's family and we can see how they too, reincarnated into the same family tree.  Assuming different sexes in different lifetimes, Ms. Bennett is able to see and &quot;experience&quot; the lessons of that soul's particular lifetime.  One of the many quotes that I thoroughly enjoyed, really put reincarnation in its perspective for me - &quot;You can't learn it all in one lifetime.  We have to keep coming back until we get it right.  Reincarnation is an extraordinary form of purification&quot;.  In addition, Ms. Bennett takes the reader on a present day journey to discover and uncover her Great Aunt Jennie's family's past history and their connections to her (Ms. Bennett)in this present lifetime.  All I can say is absolutely fascinating!!  Once engrossed in this tale, you won't be able to put the book down until you too, uncover and discover all of the connections, both past and present.  Life does indeed come full circle. So be prepared to not accomplish anyting EXCEPT finishing this book in one day!<br />This is not only a book about reincarnation, but it is also an incredibly romantic and sensuous love story, which appeals to both males and females.  We all have, at one point in our lives, searched for our elusive &quot;better half&quot; or &quot;soul-mate&quot; or as I like to think of it, our &quot;twin soul&quot;.  &quot;It's even more incredible how a life can be radically changed by meeting that one special person.  I realized that there were no accidents or coincidences.&quot;  Some of us have even had the blissful experience of knowing such joy and love in our lives, while others are still searching.  Ms. Bennett brings us into her heart and soul and opens the door for the reader to experience her longings, her searchings, her passions, and her experiences of her soulful loves, as well as the incredible passion, love and connection of her twin soul.  A love at a depth so profound, Ms. Bennett has the reader aching to experience that incredible love and passion, that incredible love of two souls' bond.  One can't help but to also travel to the heights of love, which brought tears to this reader's eyes.  You, as the reader, are right there, immersed and living it, and feeling it ALL as well.  The story will take your breath away.<br />As a woman reading this amazing true tale, I saw the inequities besought upon Jennie throughout different lifetimes due to her gender, yet what was so inspiring and so amazing, was the soul's determination to right those wrongs, to NOT have to do it again. The struggles and hardships were there and through these dark times, the joy and beauty eventually did shine through.  We all go through growth lessons and it makes one wonder why life can be so utterly hard and painful at times and why can't we do these growth lessons with ease and joy instead!!!!  &quot;My soul followed my heart.  Life was not about acquiring things.  Life was about experiences that led to growth&quot;.  Yet it is precisely this growth, this stuggle that enables to soul to grow and shine.<br />The deep messages, the deep spiritual messages, contained throughout this book will reach into each heart and soul, whether male or female, young or old, and tug at you and linger with you for days.  I know that it has for me.  I am still thinking about the book and have already re-read parts and have shared this book with friends.!!!  The beauty of the book shines though as the reader does indeed learn that love is THE MOST important state that we can aspire to, that we can emulate love and live love and breathe love on a daily basis; yet, ironically it is the same message handed down from God thousands of years ago  - the message today in the 21st century remains the same - it has not changed. &quot;There is a God of us all; a Christ spirit.  Know that all who live in body are spirits of God.  Know that all who live in body are spirits of God.  Know that love is the most important thing as we love and experience the joy of loving, we experience the love of God&quot;.<br />Thank you Ms. Bennett for sharing this beautiful tale with the rest of the world, and for allowing us the rare glimpse into one soul's &quot;journey for perfection&quot;.  Your messages will deeply affect those searching to replace the empty spaces in their lives and hearts and souls with love and hope, and knowing that at times, we don't have to do it alone - it is there for the asking.  As the Course In Miracles says, &quot;Only love is real.&quot;<br />This is a book which needs to be passed along to your significant other, as well as your family members and friends - guaranteed, they will be grateful to you if you did.  This is one of those books, which will quickly be added to your &quot;must have&quot; collection.

I began this book in the afternoon and could not put it down until I finished it, late at night.  I was riveted, and tried to figure out \\"who did it\\" and it was not until the end of the book where I had finally figured most of the pieces out!!  Gardner keeps the reader in suspense throughout and I thought that her character development was great as well.  Since many other reviewers have already summarized the book, I will let you read those and not reiterate it here.  Melanie Stokes is a woman without a past, having been adopted at age nine, by a wealthy Boston doctor and his family.  When Melanie undertakes the task of uncovering that past, people start getting killed and her illusion over her perfect family is shattered.  Her own life is in danger, as someone is determined to keep the truth from her - at any cost.<br />If you enjoy a good suspenseful thriller, which keeps you hanging, then you will immensely enjoy The Other Daughter.

I really enjoyed this book, which opened my eyes in several different aspects.  Looking at the relationship, from someone else's perspective, as well as ending an relationship, makes one more closely examine, the \\"whys\\" and the \\"what ifs\\".  But I believe that the bottom line still comes down to communication, truth and honesty - from both partners.  If the communication is not flowing, how can one know?  Truth and honesty are born from communication.  Michael Drury writes from the perspective of a mistress, speaking to the wives of not losing themselves, but maintaining that sense of self.  She speaks of marriage, love, of sex and of making love - huge difference between having sex and making love. There are many great quotes in the book, \\"Attraction can flare up in almost any situation, but love cannot long endure where there are no selves, no terminals between which the spark can alternate.\\"<br />Her advice is that of an old sage, crone woman - wise beyond her years.  This is not a book one can fly through, but to savor, mull over and contemplate such worldly advice.  Then apply it to your relationship and open the flow of communication, of total honesty and truthfulness.	2001-04-08

Linda sates, \\"I have taken life and living from the sea, and have given the same back, I suppose. ..\\"  The Hannah Boden was sister ship to the ill-fated Andrea Gail, the subject of Sebastian Junger's  book, The Perfect Strom.<br />I find Linda's chosen profession remarkable and her writing reflects her passion and her deep love of the sea.  Linda's poetic musings will surely gain her numerous fans.  Her bravery, knowledge, and tenacity combine to help Linda succeed where others have failed.  I found her musings of past voyages insightful and often funny, if not incredibly real and down to earth.  She describes her crew and the hours of toil it takes to make a living from the sea, but I glimmered her respect of the power upon which she traveled.  \\"The ocean which gives so much takes back what it needs, commanding respect and getting if form those who have seen and understand the hunger.\\"<br />I thoroughly recommend this book, even if one is NOT into fishing!  But if you love the sea in any which way, like I do, I guarantee that you will be awed and come away with a new found respect of fishmen - I know that I did.  I lived in Gloucester, the homeport of the Hannah Boden, but never understood the life of a fisherman - now I do.<br />Wonderful book - now on to read The Perfect Storm!	2001-02-04

Neruda's poems are powerful and their beauty sears into your heart with his words echoing long after.  These poems were featured in the movie, The Postman.

After just finishing Roses Are Red, by Patterson, with its brutality and gore, I found this Patterson book to be as equally absorbing and intriguing but without all of the violence.  After reading the author's note on Page Two, I knew that this book was going to be some kind of departure from \\"normalcy\\".  But when I finished this book, I had to stop and wonder about the plausibility with all of the genetic engineering going on these days.  This book will linger with you for days afterwards  . . .<br />Again, Patterson provides another quick read, with very short chapters and one can literally \\"fly\\" (sorry, no pun intended!) though this book! It was hard for me to put this book down as well.  Patterson has this knack of holding the reader captive from page one!!!<br />This is book is much different than his Alex Cross novels, as was Cradle And All, but the suspense and action are still there.  I found the character of Frannie, the local vet, to be very engaging and appealing.  The \\"winged\\" children were fascinating to read about and I have to wonder how many \\"facts\\" did Patterson gleam from his physician friends that the public is totally unaware of.  I am sure we would all be stunned to find out . .  but then again, maybe not.	2000-12-18

Dear Abby calls James Kavanaugh \\"the poet of the American people.\\"  I would have to agree with that statement as well.  His poems were not limited to a specific genre, but encompassed all of life.  The reader feels his pain, his compassion, his caring, his concern, his sadness, his anger, and his love.  Kavanaugh embraced all of life's ups and downs and lets the reader share in his emotions.  There are over 80 poems contained in this simple book, with some of them illustrated with black and white drawings, which are also by the author.<br />From his introduction; \\"So much of life is spent in an effort to be loved.  We beg for it from infancy.  We struggle to please everyone, parents, teachers, neighbors, anyone who seems important.  We do it all our lives.  Success becomes the measure of our worth.  Even the simplest failure can mean that we are not really lovable.  MAYBE IF I LOVE YOU MORE, Finally I would be loved!\\"<br />Wonderful book of one's passages though life, expressed eloquently and colorfully and most of all, deeply.	2000-12-18

The Omega Game is a suspenseful thriller, which will capture you from page one, and will not let you go, until you finish this book!  I found this book absorbing and had no trouble keeping all of the characters straight.  The book moved along, almost like a chess game!<br />The book starts out with 20 people waking up in a hotel on a lush tropical island without their memory intact of the previous 2-3 months.  There aren't any phones or computers or any electronic devices in the hotel.  No one knows how he or she got there or how he or she will leave.  They are all given an envelope with 5 rules  1) ____ is a player in the game, 2) The players must participate in the Game, 3) The players may agree to change the rules, 4) The players must obey the rules or forfeit, and 5) The winner of the Game is the last player who has not forfeited.  The reader soon finds out that to forfeit means to die.  But who are the killers? One of them, or someone unknown?  Who will be next to die and who will win \\"the Game\\"?  The reader soon finds out that the players are being watched when new envelopes with the new rules mysteriously appear when the players agree to change the rules.  The reader follows the participants in the Game and how they must cope to survive. Who can be trusted?<br />Great thriller!  This book was incredibly hard to put down and the ending will absolutely shock you!!!	2000-12-15

I read a lot of the reviews on this book and most of them were trashing the book.  I tend to disagree.  We all go through change at multiple times in our lives.  This book is not only geared to employment changes, but to relationship, friendship or moving changes, to name a few.  The principles explained here can be applied to any situation in one's life.  Unfortunately, we tend to become narrow-minded and don't realize that the principles stay the same, even though the situation may change - sometimes we just need a gentle reminder of that fact.<br />The quotes from the book are great!  Such as, \\"If you don't change you can become extinct.\\"  \\"The quicker you let go of old cheese, the sooner you find new cheese.\\"  \\"When you move beyond your fear, you feel free.\\"<br />The main message I gained WAS to move beyond my fear, and I was able to relate that to many areas in my life and the \\"change\\" for me was great!  As Blanchard says, \\" It is safer to search in the maze than remain in a cheeseless situation.\\"  How true! Life's journey is about change, but it is how we choose to embrace it to make our journey that much more enjoyable or disastrous!  So, \\"Be ready to change quickly and enjoy it again and again!\\"	2000-12-12

This book will tug at your heartstrings and pull you into the characters from the very start.  Ms. Rice is one of those rare authors who paint an incredibly accurate portrait of her characters, in which the reader feels that they are right there.  The entire story is believable and I especially love her portrayal of young adults.  She seems to have the minutest detail down pat, including their fears, frustrations and mannerisms!  It is very hard to put down a Luanne Rice book once you get started.  This was one such book!  I have read Cloud Nine and Home Fires by this author and recommend them highly as well.<br />The story follows Diane Robbins and her handicapped daughter, Julia, as Diane struggles as a single parent to raise Julia.  Her husband abandoned her after finding out their daughter was \\"not perfect\\", yet her husband's brother, Dr. Alan McIntosh, continues to stay by her and Julia's side and never abandons them.  It is through the friendliness of Amy Brooks, a lost and troubled girl, which helps Diane see, experience, and find the love that has been missing from her life, but has really been there all the time!  Definite soap opera material, but written with such sensitivity and tenderness that makes it believable and not mushy-gushy.  The reader sees love and hope bloom in several of the character's lives as their lives intertwine and they begin to open up and care for one another.  A good tearjerker of a story!  Ms. Rice once again portrays her heroines as strong women experiencing several of life's greater challenges, yet preserving and not losing hope.<br />I would love to see a sequel to this story!  Wonderful story of love and hope!  Highly recommend this book!!!	2000-11-20

The author, searching for contact with her late mother, investigates numerous venues, such as astrology, channeling, tarot cards, psychics, and past life regression to name a few.  After several different people whom she has contacted validate one another, the author slowly begins to embrace that \\"there is something else out there.\\"<br />Does the author directly contact her deceased mother?  No, but indirectly she does, which also brings her to a new awareness as well as opening her previously very skeptic mind.  I admire her frankness and sarcasm throughout the book, which at times is very humorous indeed!  The chapter on synchronicity was very insightful, as we all seem to be experiencing many synchronistic moments these days.<br />The author helps the reader see that there is more \\"out there\\" on the other side and if we but open our minds to other possibilities, we just may receive the answers that we have been searching for.<br />Very good book and I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to learn more who is also a skeptic!  This book will definitely change your mind!	2000-11-20

Contrary to other reviewers, I found Molly to be an evolving character, gaining strength and becoming powerful and self-assured.  Bretton does a great job on character development, which enables the reader to easily embrace and relate to all of the characters.  You are drawn into Molly's tragedy and can feel her pain and heartache. I found Rafe to be a strong and compassionate character and you genuinely cheer for both he and Molly and a life of happiness together.<br />Bretton is another one of those authors expounding upon the power of love in the midst of tragedy.<br />This story was nicely written, tender and compassionate and a story you want to savor for a long time.  It is a story of hope and joy and I thoroughly recommend it!	2000-11-13

The Beach House is the second Georgia Bockoven novel I have read and I found this novel to be as excellent as the first one I read (Far Away From Home).  This novel centers around real life issues and real life characters, all of whom are embracing losses of one kind or another.  Bockoven's writing draws the reader into experiencing each and every heartache of all of the characters, and you can't help but be drawn into the heart of the matter.  Her character depth will indeed have you crying. Her characters are easily embraced because they are so real and their life-situations are not set in some fantasy world.  All of the women characters were strong and independent and not weak and malleable.<br />This is another wonderful book illustrating love's power and healing force.  I especially found the scene on the couple that was married for over 60 years quite tender and touching.  Bockoven once again proves that despite the pain and tragedy in one's life, love can work its magic and heal.<br />This is one book that you will want to read more than once and this book comes with my highest recommendation!	2000-11-13

This is a delightfully, wonderful book on how to make various sizes of miniature bears, from 1 3/4 \\" to 5\\" bears!  The author, Julie Owen, does an outstanding job in instructing the reader in the creation of these precious bears.  One can't but help to fall in love and want to create each and every one!  Ms. Owen presents a bear to create for each month of the year, in addition to a Sailor Bear, a Polar Bear, and a Baby Bear!  Included also are the instructions for the basic 10 bears, on which all of the monthly bears are based on. Other women from around the world have created several of the bears and there is a short credit and story of these bears along with the instructions!  Clothes patterns are also included with those bears sporting garments!<br />What I especially love about this book, in addition to the precise and accurate directions, are the incredible pictures and the tips for construction.  Nothing seems to have been left out of this book!  The author is based in the UK, so the supply list reflects that origin, but most of the supplies can be gathered from your local craft or sewing store in the US.<br />As an avid sewer, I read this book from a sewer's point of view, and found myself constructing the bears along with the directions, and noting that nothing seemed to have been left out by the author.  In addition to the construction tips, the reader will find great embellishment tips, to make their bears unique.<br />Ms. Owen has been making bears for quite a long time and also teaches bear workshops.  This book reflects her expertise and her love of the bears.  This is one of THE BEST craft/sewing books I have seen in a long time. This is a book in which everything you see, you can make!  The author also includes a sample birth certificate for your creation!<br />If you are interested in making your own miniature bears, I highly recommend this excellent book!!	2000-11-13

It was impossible to \\"stop\\" reading - \\"just one more chapter\\"!!!  That day nothing whatsoever got done that was supposed to!<br />I love the way Patterson leaves you hanging from chapter to chapter and the suspense of a serial killer was gripping!  Knowing who the killer was in the beginning of the book was great in that you were trying to figure out what the next move was going to be and it was always a surprise!  The dark, sick, and twisted mind of Geoffrey Schaffer was graphically and excellently portrayed in the book.  I was intrigued also by Cross trying to psychologically figure this guy out throughout the trial of murders as Schaffer was playing \\"the game\\". The suspense kept masterfully building.  I was expecting some show at the end of the book by Geoffrey Schaffer, but never expected that shocker of an ending!!  Phew!  Give me more Alex Cross!!  I would love to see this book as a sequel!<br />I became a Patterson fan with Cradle And All, and now I am hooked completely!

The dialogue between Janie and Sam was often times hilarious and I found myself laughing out loud as well.  The concept of \\"The List\\" and the plot around the list was interesting along with the murders occurring because of the publicity generated.  Howard did do a really good job on the interaction of all of the characters and their development.<br />Based on this book, this author is not one in which I would run out and get her next book to read as soon as I could.	2000-11-13

I have just about all of his books and have read numerous books more than once.  I cannot begin to describe the hope and inspiration he has provided to me in my times of despair.  The world is a much better place because of the love, power, and strength of Og Mandino's literary jewels.<br />The Twelfth Angel is a powerful testament to courage, faith, hope and most importantly, love.  I have carried that quote from Winston Churchill around with me for years, \\"Never, never, never, never, never give up!\\".  Og is able to take the reader to heights I have never before felt with another author.  I can now understand readers writing to him with their testimonies of wanting to end their life and after reading a Mandino story, they were infused with such hope and the courage to go on.  This story will do that for you as well.<br />I am sure that we all have felt and experienced soul wrenched despair and thinking the only solution was suicide.  John Harding, the main character, experiences these very thoughts and feelings and angels appear in his life in the form of some very special people, including a very special little boy named Tim.  I really believe that it is little Timmy who gives John the will to live again and John helps to give back to Timmy, as he embraces life once again.<br />This is story which will make you cry and yet have you soaring on hope and love.  As I said in the beginning, I absolutely love Og Mandino and have nothing but the highest praise for each and every one of his books.  I re-read them often and share them with friends.  I guarantee that you too, will fall in love with this incredible author - an angel himself.<br />Please give this book to your children to read - it will have an impact on them - guaranteed.  This is the kind of book that will stay in your heart for days.	2000-11-09

After Miranda's attempted suicide by flinging herself off of a cliff, she is rescued by Adam Kirkpatric, whereby she is forced to confront her anger at being alive.  Miranda, with Adam's helps, is able to realize that she is not guilty nor is she responsible, for the horrific tragedy that befell her.  It is with Adam's caring and kindness and eventual love for Miranda, which allows Miranda to heal both emotionally and physically as well as to eventually love again.<br />The author has an amazing way of embracing one of life's tragedies, and letting the reader feel the raw, vulnerable emotions of the characters, as if they were one's own.  I found the characters believable, as well as the tragic situation believable and felt the despair, which permeated most of this story.  Yes, the romantic twist held my attention, but to me, that was not the main focus of this story.  Life hurts at times, and we can wallow in it and lose ourselves or we can let love in and heal - and love can come to us by various different angels!<br />Wonderful book full of hope and love!

She writes of tragedy and loss that will have you weeping but by the end of this book, you are smiling with joy at the realization of love and hope in this family in the midst of all of the tragedy.<br />I absolutely loved the tenderness, understanding, and compassion in the character of Thomas Devlin - (yes, Thomas, where are you? :-)).  I admired the strength and courage in Anne Davis after the recent loss of her four-year-old daughter.  She draws the reader completely into the depth of each character, from young to old, and you feel like you know them intimately and can relate to them all.  You experience their pain, grief, and uncertainty and mourn their losses.  Rice's ability to magically draw on the emotions and real life scenarios of family life is really amazing.<br />This book's message is indeed one of hope, trust and love.  Luanne Rice lets you know that amidst the chaos of tragedy, love can find roots, grow sprouts, and blossom gloriously again - one just has to trust and let love in.<br />I love to see this book made into a movie!

Be sure to keep plenty of Kleenex handy, as you will need them for this book!<br />This was one of the most beautiful love stories I have read and Luann Rice is quickly becoming another favorite author of mine.  I just finished reading Home Fires by her the night before and now Cloud Nine - what an emotional ride!!<br />Rice writes stories that grip your heart and soul and she does not let go until the story is over.  Her character portrayal, especially of teen-agers, is so realistic, that you feel that they are your next-door neighbors and closest friends!  Cloud Nine embraces all the nuances of family life, which has experienced death and familial loss, and the heartache that that causes.  It embodies tragedy in multiple scenarios consisting of divorce, remarriage, cancer, and several deaths, yet, contained within all of these facts, there is a ray of faith and hope that life can and will get better.  There is hope of reconciliation and the miracle of love working its magic.  The character's live are not portrayed here as \\"perfect\\", but are wrought with dysfunction and pain, due to real-life experiences.<br />I found this story's ending to be bittersweet and wish that it did end differently, but once again, I am reminded that life is not perfect and life sometimes does not play out as we want it to - it is just fe being life.  Rice expertly captures that feeling with Cloud Nine and conveys it so beautifully to her readers.  You are swept up into the emotions of the drama and you cannot help it.<br />I absolutely loved this book and once again Rice demonstrates to us that love has a powerful and healing effect, on both the young and the old.  Her message is of embracing life each and every day as a gift to yourself and to your loved ones, as one never knows what the next day will bring.	2000-11-03

Why would I want to change, even for a day, the most important and shaping event in my life?\\"<br />This single quote could summarize this most remarkable book, by an equally remarkable man.  After reading this book, (in which I stayed up until it was finished), I am just totally amazed at Lance's guts, determination and strength in fighting testicular cancer, which should have, according to the poor odds against him (less than 3%), killed him. Lance, instead of becoming a victim, chose instead to be survivor!<br />Here a story of inspiration that will bring tears to your eyes, tears of compassion, joy and triumph.  This is one man's story of incredible challenge of digging down deep for inner resources in managing and conquering cancer.  Lance refused to become a statistic and instead rallied and became cancer's worst enemy.  He refused to give in and chose to fight the disease with all that he had.  I admire his love and admiration for his mother, who continues to be one of his strengths in his life.  He was fortunate, as well, to have loving friends support him throughout his entire ordeal.<br />\\"The one thing the illness has convinced me of beyond all doubt - more than any experience I've had as an athlete - is that we are much better than we know.  We have unrealized capacities that sometime only emerge in crisis.  So, if there is a purpose to the suffering that is cancer, I think it must be this: it's meant to improve us.\\"<br />The book chronicles the emotional and physical changes Lance undergoes as he triumphs over cancer as well as his emotional coping both during and after.  This is a book of true courage and determination.  Lance set up a foundation to help other cancer patients manage and survive their cancer. Lance lives his mother's inspiration of  \\"make every obstacle an opportunity.\\"<br />Lance proves that the power of the mind, combined with taking control of one's disease, seeking different opinions and doctors, and becoming an expert on the topic can help one overcome and conquer cancer.<br />This is book is an excellent, poignant and emotional testimony to one man's faith and determination.

Alaina Costanza is thrown back into time, captured into the latest romance story she is writing.  Unbeknownst to Alaina, her villain character, Killian, is actually her soul mate, reaching across time and space to Alaina to rectify the loss and love in both of their lives in the late 1870's.<br />I thought the concept was ingenious and really enjoyed this book of time-travel!  I also found it interesting that Hannah picked out several elements from her book, The Enchantment, and used those elements in this book! I thought it very clever!<br />Hannah once again paints a heroine who is strong and determined, with supporting characters that are as equally believable.  The reader is immediately drawn into the story, and I thought that the story line moved great!  This is the last book of Hannah's that I had left to read, and it, too, did not disappoint me.<br />Kristin Hannah has quickly become one of my favorite authors due to her ability to draw the reader intensely into the heart and plot of the story, with believable and true to life characters.  Her love stories are warm and sensitive, with the heroine able to overcome obstacles in her life, and embrace love once again.  I have found that all of Hannah's books contain messages of struggle, hope and love.  And as always, once you fall in love with the characters in her books, you are dying for a sequel!	2000-10-30

All I can is AMAZING.  The artwork, by various artists, is just beautiful and not just limited to the angels.  Unicorns, fairies, medicine woman and cherubs are also displayed here.  The borders around each of the 44 cards are just as beautiful.<br />What I like so much about the cards, is that I feel that the message of the day from the angels, turns out to be what I need to hear that day.  After digesting the messages in the book, I tune into what the angels are trying to tell me.  The healing messages of peace are very calming and uplifting.  The secret, I am finding, is to just invite them to help out in your life.  I was prompted to buy theses gems after receiving an angel reading from someone using the cards - I am so glad I did!<br />Another wonderful angelic tool for one's use from Doreen Virtue!	2000-10-27

One needs to be forewarned that one will be releasing &quot;negative&quot; garbage by the completion of this tape. I think that one will find that one's negative issues will be released swiftly, and in some cases, some issues in which one was not even aware that they were carrying them around!  All I can say is that I used this tape the first day I received it and felt &quot;pounds&quot; of negativity fall away and I really felt lighter and more joyful.  I intend to use this tape on a weekly basis, in conjunction with Doreen's other tapes!<br />Very powerful and cleansing!!!!  Highly recommend this tape.	2000-10-27

Since I have read all but 2 of her books, I can say that I enjoy her later novels so much better than her earlier works!  Hannah's writing embodies that magic which draws readers into the heart and soul of the characters and this can be seen in her earlier novels, but it is more explosive in her later works!  Everything about her later novels cries \\"believable\\"!  I found this book to be not as believable as her other novels and became bored reading it during several parts of it.  It was an OK book, but then again I am not much of a reader of historical romance.<br />Hannah writes of strong heroines who seem to overcome adversity resiliently and are very much in control.  Still, I just could not get into this story.  Sometimes I felt like I was reading a Harlequin romance, which is not what I was seeking to read - oh well.  I felt that Ms. Devon was not quite the believable character I had come to expect from Ms. Hannah.<br />I have quickly become a die-hard Hannah fan and eagerly await her next book due out early next spring.  Hannah's books will not disappoint you and it just depends what kind of \\"love-story\\" one is seeking to read.  But nonetheless, Hannah remains a true hopeless romantic and this shines in all of her books!	2000-10-27

The Enchantment, her second book, pales in comparison to her more recent books, especially Angel Falls, Mystic Lake, and Home Again, to name a few.<br />I devoured her other books, but found The Enchantment relatively slow going and a tad bit sophomoric at times.  Disappointingly, this book is not as good as her later books in which she draws the reader straight into the heart of her characters as well as into the plot.  I really could not find the characters really that believable.  Yet, once again and true to form, Hannah delivers her \\"message\\" of hope and renewal, as both characters learn to shed their old haunting habits and persona by learning to trust and letting love in.  The setting was just not believable at all to me, searching for the lost city of Cibola in New Mexico in the late 1800's.<br />This is not one of Hannah's better novels and the title of the book would not have caught my eye either.  This is an OK story with a few redeeming passages!  But don't let this review discourage other readers from reading and savoring Hannah's other books - they are definitely delightful and sure to earn Hannah new fans!	2000-10-25

I have been totally captivated by all of his books, but this one is by far, to me, his best love story.  Once I picked up this book, I could not put it down and stayed up till the wee hours finishing the book!!<br />I find the sensitivity portrayed in Sparks' books unusual for a male author.  His insight and tenderness seem to wash over the reader in waves, engulfing you and tugging at your heartstrings.  His characters come alive as, we too, can feel the depth of their pain, joy, and their emotions.<br />This love story is a story of broken love, hurt and betrayal experienced by both Denise and Taylor.  Yet, both characters are seeking, in their own ways, to love and trust again.  But first, they both must learn to let go of the past, their deep hurts, and realize that their past cannot be compared to the present.  Until they step beyond the realization that they cannot compare events that happened to them in the past to their current situation, they cannot have a future.  Denise is able to successfully do this and to stand strong in her convictions, but Taylor struggles constantly with this and until he finally realizes that he needs to heal by letting go of his past which continually haunts him, otherwise he will never be able to find happiness or peace in his life.  Interestingly enough, I think we all can see a part of ourselves in this story as well.  We can choose to be happy now, learn from our past mistakes, forgive ourselves and move on, or we can wallow in the past and make ourselves absolutely miserable.  Once again, our choice!  Seeing Taylor experiencing his pain and his struggles in letting go were very enlightening, moving, and so real.  Sparks brings his reader to a depth of emotions like no other.  Yet the message here is in trusting and letting love weave its magic and healing, when one finds the right partner in life.<br />The story is genuine, modern, and real and not some far fetched fantasy world.  My only complaint was Kyle's speech impediment became a bit too much for the reader.  I think the point was made early on.<br />I absolutely loved this book and eagerly await the next book by Nicholas Sparks!far fetched fantasy world.

This tape is absolutely wonderful - I am using the tape on a daily basis to help release old blocks and to work with forgiveness. I must say that after doing the tape, just once, I felt &quot;lighter&quot; and I felt that I &quot;was&quot; able to release allot of old baggage!! The tape will calm you and bring you a great sense of peace.<br />The message I gained from Doreen was to let go and let God. Don't try to &quot;push&quot; what you want, but let Divine Intervention take over and do the work! Sometimes it is hard to ask for help, but Doreen's tape gently nudges you to do just that. Helping to forgive and to heal past hurts will pave the way for you to let love shine in!<br />I heartily recommend this tape.	2000-10-20

Waiting For The Moon is another tearjerker from Kristin Hannah in which the reader becomes totally absorbed into the characters and the story.  Hannah's writing portrays true-to-life characters, which anyone can relate to due to the emotional depth of every single one of her characters.  We suffer with them through the good and the bad and our box of Kleenex is never far from us!!!!<br />Hannah's books always portray a hidden message to the reader, yet all of her subtle messages are woven with hope and love.  Despite the hurt and tragedies in all of our lives, love seems to always prevail and the sun does shine!!  No exception with this story!<br />After an attempted suicide, Selena wakes up a completely different person from what she was, without any memories of her past.  She weaves her innocent child-like magic of love with the other residents of Lethe House in Maine where she was brought to be healed.  She affects every single life for the better in that house and rays of sunshine emerge for all, who are living in pain and misery.<br />With all of Hannah's books, you want a sequel and this book is no exception!!

This is the fourth book of hers that I have read and I simply cannot read her books fast enough!  This book is incredibly emotional and it pulls you right into the character's world with such intensity, that you will definitely need a box of Kleenex handy!<br />Hannah has the talent of making her characters come alive with such depth and emotion.  You feel their struggles, their losses and their loves.  You feel their fear and you understand it all.  Hannah writes with such emotion that you cannot but help becoming lost in the story line.  She once again has you so connected to the characters, that you feel that you know them and this what endears readers to her.  Hannah does not write your typical mush and gush romance novel - the love and romance is more real, down-earth and believable.  Her heroines all seem to face reality-based challenges, which anyone can relate to, as well as to overcoming those challenges.<br />Hannah's writing is laced not only with depth filled emotions, but also with a unique sensitivity that touches the reader at a level most other authors never come close to.  She manages to weave her magic from the very beginning and the reader is gently released from that magic web at the very end, with a very deep sigh!  But her story will linger with you for days.  As with all of her books - you want a sequel!<br />What more can I say?  Kristin Hannah has fast become one of my favorite authors and her stories will leave you thinking, pondering and wondering as well as feeling good!  This book is definitely a keeper and wish I could rate it with more than 5 stars!  Angel Falls, On Mystic Lake and Home Again are others by Hannah, which I have read and fell in love with!<br />This is a story of love and hope eternal which I could not put down until I finished it.

This is not a mush and gush romantic tale - but one of love and lost love.  The heroine, Liz Adams, sacrifices herself for her father's wishes, dreams, and commands.  Liz lives her life based on the decisions her father makes for her, as well as for her three other siblings.  All of their lives become intertwined when Liz's husband, Michael, runs for the Presidency and even more so, when their patriarch dies and Liz is left to confront the façade and charade she has lived, and the love that she yearned for and could not have.<br />This tale had many characters, and all were equally interesting but not to the point of confusion - a nice mix and balance.<br />This story kept me guessing and I would really love to see a sequel to this book!! Too many unanswered questions and too many open-ended issues left in the book!<br />This is my first book by Jean Stone and I would enthusiastically recommended this book to other readers.

If you read the other reviews, there is not much more for me to add in the way of content of the book - I agree with all of the reviewers.<br />This book will blow your socks off and it is one book that you will want to mark up, highlight and copy passages to keep with you daily.  I am on the second reading and cannot begin to explain the liberation I feel in the change of my thoughts, letting go of fear and learning how to live in the light.  I feel as if a light bulb has gone off and \\"I have finally gotten it!!!!\\".<br />Reading this book, one can feel the love emanating from each and every page - and sometimes you feel as if Jesus himself is speaking to you.  The wisdom, beauty, and love are simplistic, yet mankind has complicated the teachings of Jesus.  It really is simple - \\"to be as Jesus\\" - as Price says.  To align your consciousness with God, to let go of fear- which is the way for the ego to control us - to just be in the love and presence of God.<br />The chapters on healing were eye opening in the sense that we are already empowered to heal ourselves - yet once again fear may prevent us from accomplishing this.<br />Our indoctrinated beliefs have prevented many of us from truly experiencing all that we can be - all that God has wanted us to be. The abundance that God provides to all is there - we are the ones who have &quot;learned&quot; to limit ourselves.  This book will teach you ever so swiftly to &quot;unlearn&quot; your limiting thinking and bring abundance into your life.<br />Living in joy is what this book is all about - I would rate this book 10 stars if I could - It is one amazing, insightful, and one of the most profound books I have ever read!!!!  I am now on a mission to read all of Price's other books.	2000-10-13

After reading this book, a sense of peace enveloped me - I think that anyone who reads this book will find the same to be true.<br />The healing messages do indeed cover just about every area of one's life, from addiction, to betrayal, to children, to love and loneliness, to money, to trust, to fun, to grief and to dreams, just to name a few.  Doreen adds, \\"Their (the angels) messages help us heal our beliefs and thoughts by offering us empowering, loving viewpoints.  They teach us how to use our spiritual senses to see, hear, feel and know the real world that transcends the illusory world's problems.\\"  I learned that my own beliefs often imprison me and limit my joy now.<br />This book speaks to your heart with soothing messages love, which comfort even the most stressed out or anguished person.  I have written numerous favorite sayings down and carry them as my bookmark in the current book I am reading, just to remind myself that I am comforted and loved when needed.  Love is a powerful force from God and the angels, and if you, too, surrender your \\"problems\\", you can experience miracles in your life!<br />This book is absolutely wonderful and I especially enjoyed Part II on Communicating, Healing and Living with the Angels.  The angels are God's gifts to us and are there whenever we need assistance.  All we need to do is ask and they are there to soothe, comfort, uplift and guide us.  After reading this book, I came away with refreshing and new healing insights to my own personal dilemmas.  This book will inspire, heal, and uplift you - in more ways than one!!!!!	2000-10-12

I call it awful and would not waste my time reading it.<br />I \\"struggled\\" through this book, and I only finished it because I was curious on seeing where it was trying to go. It never went anywhere.<br />The characters were boring and horrible. The writing style put me to sleep and I could not get into the characters or setting at all. I found the \\"heroine\\" utterly dry and stupid. Everything about this book was flat and dead.<br />This book is only \\"stunningly\\" boring and goes nowhere. I thought I was reading something an adolescent wrote - the style was not mature or sophisticated at all. There was absolutely no psychological suspense to this book at all. There is no depth, or passion or power to this debut novel. And no, this novel will not haunt you with its' beauty because there is no beauty contained anywhere in this book.<br />I am a voracious reader, but this book is the first book that I have read that never ever lived up to its book jacket \\"thrilling\\" description.

As with all of her other books, you want a sequel to the book.  The dramas portrayed are so true to life, that you have to remind yourself, \\"this is just a story . . .!!!!\\"<br />This is a book of hope and faith and love.  This book will have you weeping at the loss, the hurt and the self-destruction of lives and yet you will be cheering at the turn around.  We learn about the power of forgiveness and the power of love and wishing we all had a friend like Francis in our lives.  This love story is also a story of inspiration.<br />Hannah once again does a tremendous job of painting characters so realistically while skillfully imparting to her readers another uplifting message of love and hope.<br />This is my third book by Kristin Hannah and I have cried through every one of them and I cannot read them fast enough!!  She is fast becoming one of my favorite authors.  I am not a big romance reader, but I find that her books tug at your heart while depicting life as it is and not some fantasy.<br />I could easily give this book more than 5 stars - I guarantee you won't be disappointed in this book or in any of her other books.	2000-10-05

Hannah brings reality home in her novels and leaves the reader questioning her own life!  Hannah does not write the typical \\"mush and gush\\" dime store romance novels, but instead breathes life into her characters in settings which could very well happen in our own lives.  You can't help but fall in love with her characters as well as being able relate to them.  The reader slides effortlessly into the story which Hannah is painting, so much so that one often  forgets that this is \\"just\\" a novel - her characters are indeed THAT real.  This is just one of the traits which endears Hannah's fans to her and who just cannot wait for the next novel to come out!<br />Annie goes back \\"home\\" after her husband informs her that, after 20 years of marriage, he wants out, as he is in love with another woman.  Annie is forced to face and confront her life, her life decisions and how she came to lose herself during her marriage.  On Mystic Lake is a journey of one woman's quest to find her real self.  Along her journey, she meets up with an old friend from high school who is grieving after the suicide of his wife and who is unable to comfort and relate to his six-year old daughter who has been devastated by the loss of her mother.<br />While all three of the main characters are forced to deal with tragedy in their lives, it is the essences of these tragedies, which pulls them all together and plants the seeds of love and hope to grow.<br />The reader experiences the emotional catharsis of Annie as she bravely confronts her fears and weaknesses and finds the emotional strength to overcome and emerge as a more powerful, strong woman who finally goes after that which she truly desires - love.<br />Once again, I read another of Hannah's books in one sitting.  They are much too good to put down - it is impossible!  This is an excellent book - a love story that will have you maybe rethinking your own sacrifices in your life!

The ending is explosive, with intriguing twists, turns, and subplots along the way. As with all of Sheldon's books, I have to finish them in one day, as I cannot bear to NOT know what the next chapter will bring!<br />The ending is a shocker, as it is with all of Sheldon's books, with all of the character's \\"secrets\\" unraveling and exposed.  Sheldon is great at keeping the reader cleverly baited until the very end.  Sheldon sort of deviates from his typical strong main heroine character type on this tale and casts his light instead on four heirs to their father's massive fortune, with one of the heirs being illegitimate.  Murder, mayhem, revenge, greed, blackmail, and hate all cast their hooks in this one, with some romance thrown in. As usual, the reader gets immediately drawn into the mystery and gets completely knocked off course just when you think you have figured out \\"who did it\\"!  The action is non-stop!<br />This book will not disappoint any Sheldon fans and I found it to be one of his best.	2000-09-28

A Man Called Dave is the heart-warming conclusion of the autobiographical trilogy which began with A Child Called It and The Lost Boy.  As with Dave's other books, this book will also have you crying and cheering.  Crying at the horror of what he lived though, crying at his stolen youth, crying at his courage and aiming to please and to be the best at whatever he attempted in his life, especially being a wonderful father to his son. Crying because he never, ever gave up.  You will be cheering at his accomplishments, at facing and overcoming his fears and cheering most of all, because Dave Pelzer learned to grow in love and not to grow in hate. Dave not only learned to love, but he learned to forgive admist the hate.  You will cheer at his hope and how that spark of hope kept him going - kept him surviving.<br />I do so admire this man, who fought against THE most incredible odds of abuse by his mother, to become a New York Times best-selling author, having a distinguished career with the air force, and receiving numerous prestigious humanitarian awards, one of which was being chosen in 1994 as the only American to receive The Outstanding Young Persons of the World award.  Dave also contributes his time and talent in helping other abused children and teens to overcome their familial abuse and to reach their potential.<br />Dave's faith in God helped pull him through, but Dave also proved that he had faith in himself and the strength to persevere.  As a child, his mother physically brutalized him, stabbed him, starved him, tortured him mentally, and treated the family dog better than she treated him.  Yet he never, never gave up.  As with other abused children, Dave also sought the approval of his mother until the day she died.  I cry just thinking about what he lived through, what he endured for so long before his school intervened and \\"rescued\\" him from his torture chamber.<br />This book deserves a 10 and I HIGHLY recommend reading the entire trilogy of Dave's books (More 10s!!!).

US	52853018	RD20LTCT4Y3U	0609605925	781244785	Angel Falls	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Soul gripping love story	I absolutely could NOT put this book down and had to finish it in one day.  This is my first read with Kristin Hannah and I found her to be a compelling author.  Not only did I cry throughout the entire book, but I also was captured immediately and absorbed thoroughly into the lives of the characters.  I was able to \\"feel\\" their emotions and pain and their love for one another.  I hardly read romance novels, yet when I am compelled to do so, I tend to seek those novels out that are not mushy and gushy, but those that are more realistic and of speak of a true and unrequited love! This is such a book.  If you are looking for mush and gush you will not find it here.  If you looking for a contemporary and more realistic \\"love story\\", this is the book for you!<br />I found this story to be heart wrenching at times and yet the love and devotion that Dr. Liam Campbell displayed towards his wife during their marriage, is the love that most of us women long for!  Sometimes it takes tragedy in one's life to verbally express all those \\"take-for-granted\\" things we forget to say to those we love.  Liam's love for Mikela is genuine and true, and in fact, so true and deep, that he even searches out Mikela's first husband to help bring Mikela out of her coma and back to her family which adores and loves her.<br />The reader is gripped by the emotions of her two children, Jacey and Brett and what they are feeling and experiencing.  At times you just want to take Brett into your arms and just hug him!  The author did an absolutely wonderful job of completely capturing the reader's attention, emotions and heart throughout the entire book.  I felt like I was right there, living it all with them.  Very few books do this to me.<br />While Mikela was in the coma as a result of falling off her horse, she \\"awakened\\" to the fact that her undying flame of love for her ex-husband was really an obsession and did not and would not stand the test of time.  She finally let go of her entrapping pain and misery and saw the real, time-tested love, which Liam has for her and the children.  It was the daily devotion of her husband by her bedside as well as their love as a family, which helped bring Mikela out of her coma.<br />I absolutely loved this book, which tugged at my heartstrings like no other book has.  Let yourself be carried away into the lives of the Campbells and you too will feel like you are right there.  Have plenty of tissues available and may we all find that time tested love in our lives like Liam has for Mikela!!!n and misery and saw the real, time-tested love, which Liam has for her and the children.

Tell Me Your Dreams, a suspenseful psycho thriller by Sheldon, is another can't put down book!  Ashley Patterson, suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD),  is accused of committing numerous brutal and ghastly murders, all on men, and all of which she cannot remember doing.<br />Sheldon has us suspended during the courtroom proceedings and leads us down a path, where you are kept wondering, \\"how is Ashley going to get out of this one?\\"  With a reversal of a guilty verdict, we follow Ashley into a psychiatric hospital where her goal is to integrate her other two personalities, label her \\"cured\\" and release her back into society.<br />I found the chapters on the treatments of MPD quite fascinating and can only imagine the real-life horrific traumas occur to have this happen to people, as explained in the book  - (I don't want to give away the suspense!)<br />The ending is TOTALLY unexpected, which keeps Sheldon's fans coming back for more and more and more . . . .  Just make sure you read the ending slowly!!<br />This book, even though it is fiction, is based on actual medical evidence. I thoroughly recommend this book and once again, Sheldon fans will NOT be disappointed.	2000-09-22

Each book is a gem!  I could not  write down the quotes fast enough from this book! This book will leave you  joyful as well as hopeful in this most romantic tale.<br />Pilar is confronted  with facing herself - either she embraces her love or she walks away from  it in the form of her childhood friend, who has misgivings about entering  the seminary, due to his enduring love for her.  She encounters the  feminine face and force of God, which desires her to open up to love.  Likewise, her seminarian is facing the battle of choosing between love and  God. Both characters encounter challenges of the heart and find that they  can have the best of both worlds - of love and of God.  This is NOT a pushy  or preachy religious book, but a book, which imparts the feminine and  masculine aspects of God in our lives amidst the deep love of a man and a  woman have for each other.  \\"The previous day, the world had made sense,  even without love's presence.  But now we needed each other in order to see  the true brilliance of things (88).\\"<br />\\"But love is always new.  Regardless  of whether we love once, twice, or a dozen times in our life, we always  face a brand-new situation.  Love can consign us to hell or to paradise,  but it always takes us somewhere.  We simply have to accept it, because it  is what nourishes our existence.  If we reject it, we die of hunger,  because we lack the courage to stretch out a hand and pluck the fruit from  the branches of the tree of life.  We have to take love where we find it,  even it that means hours, days, weeks of disappointment and sadness.  The  moment we begin to seek love, love begins to seek us.  And to save us.  (79)\\"<br />Coelho, the eternal optimist, shows us once again the power of love  and of God's love in our lives.  This book is a quick read and it is one of  Coelho's best!  A great love story!	2000-09-19

In our disposable society today, it is so refreshing to read about  true love, faith, and commitment.<br />Kim Carpenter's wife, Krickitt, was  not expected to survive massive head injuries sustained from a head on  collision with a truck.  Miraculously and against all odds, she did  survive.  Her faith in God, along with the unrelenting adoration and help  of her husband and family (and of course all of the doctors!) helped pull  Krickitt back into a functioning world.  Unfortunately, Krickitt lost all  memory of her brief marriage, engagement and courtship with her husband.  Kim held on steadfast to his marriage vows and never, never gave up,  despite the unsurmounting odds of their marriage ever surviving such  tragedies.<br />It is so humbling to read of their devout faith in God, which  pulled them both through some incredible life challenges, if not providing  miracles in their lives, time and time again.  Kim's heartfelt love for  Krickitt comes through strongly and I do so admire his integrity, his  devotion and the love he has for his wife.  This story is a huge testament  to the power and bond of love and marriage.  I do believe that many men in  his position would have walked out and not stood by Krickitt's side.<br />The Carpenters renewed their wedding vows for a second time, as Kim had  to woo Krickitt all over again, as she had no memory of her husband at all.  Their lives will no longer be what it was before the accident and Krickett  is not the same person she was before, as is Kim.  Both have grown and both  have a deeper commitment and love for one another.<br />Living a nightmare in  every conceivable way, the Carpenter's faith in God gave them the strength  and will to persevere. God often gives us challenges in life and we do not  understand why, and only later do the \\"lessons\\" or the meaning of all  become clear to us.  The messages imparted in this heart-felt story will  hopefully ignite the love shared in all marriages and to help to heal those  marriages in trouble and cement even further those solid marriages.<br />This story will have you crying and cheering as well as have you  questioning what is \\"really\\" important in our lives and how faith in God  can pull us through even the darkest nightmares.  Love and undying faith is  what it is all about!<br />Kim Carpenter you are one heck of a guy - the world  needs more guys like you!

Diana does fight - she does not give up and she is  still fighting.  Her struggles throughout the book, her hiding information  from her family and friends, all testify to her strength and fierce  determination to conquer this disease.<br />I thought the actions and  reactions of her children as well as her husband was very revealing and at  times sad.<br />This is an excellent book for anyone coping with a loved one  with AD - I found it very insightful, informative, and helpful.

Even though this book has very mixed reviews - I did like it.  I tried to read the book as an inspirational book and not as a book written by \\"a  famous person.\\"<br />I did find the book inspirational and I believe that if  one keeps \\"Maria Shriver's\\" persona in perspective, one can gleam some very  insightful and powerful messages that this book is imparting.  The author  is famous, beautiful, successful and a self proclaimed over-achiever - she  is driven and has been and continues to be successful.  Her words of wisdom  are illustrated by her hard knocks in life - her time in the trenches.  She  speaks from the experience of a woman, a mother, a wife, a daughter and a  career woman.  She impressed me as someone not resting on her \\"privileged\\"  upbringing, but really pursing her passion and working hard for her  success.  I really enjoyed the chapter \\"Superwoman is Dead . . .\\".  I guess  we woman do want to be superwoman and have and do it all, but the reality  is pinpointed home that we really can't be and those who proclaim they are,  are lying!<br />I enjoyed Maria's humor and I admire her success.  I could  relate to her fears and inadequacies and I wish that I had some of these  words of wisdom imparted to me both before and after college - my choices  would have different.  I felt the book was very down to earth and I enjoyed  reading stories from her childhood and about her parents.  Her humor and  honesty livened the stories, making the book very approachable.  Yet I  have to wonder, do we read inspirational books and heed some of the advice  or do we still need to experience our own struggles and failures and losses  before we heed the advice we read years, months or even days ago from those  that have \\"been there, done that\\"?<br />There are many gems of wisdom of  contained in this little, fast reading book which I thoroughly enjoyed.  I  would recommend this book to all ages and for both sexes!	2000-08-30

This is the third book of his that I have read and I  found his latest book to be no different!  This is an excellent book - it  will have you questioning your own life and the value that you do or don't  place on it.<br /> As some of the reviewers have said - this is a book about  life and not about death and I could not agree more.  After an unsuccessful  attempt at suicide, Veronika awakens in a mental hospital with a grim death  sentence hanging over her head of only having five days left to live.  Her  conformist way of life, her mediocrity, her stifled creativity, as well as  her unwillingness to take risks or challenges, are all brought into the  limelight for the reader to \\"feel\\".  The reader experiences many emotions  on Veronika's journey during the remaining five days of her life.  We are  treated to what her dream \\"would have been\\" if she followed her heart and  allowed her emotions and passions to shine through.<br />Veronika's five-day  metamorphosis is in effect her rebirth into life. She allows her buried  feelings, passions and creativity to surface and to be acknowledged.  Her  brief stay also influences other patients in the hospital, as they too  undergo their own rebirth into the joy of living.<br />The ending of this tale  will come as a surprise to some readers, to others maybe not.  Nonetheless,  this book is excellent and will re-confirm to the reader just how precious,  joyous and love-filled life is. This book also brings home many messages,  the most important one being - life is what you make it - it is your choice  and your choice alone - one can either live life to the fullest or be a  walking zombie as Veronika was.<br />I thoroughly recommend this book as  another inspiring and thought provoking book by Paulo Coelho.  I very much  look forward to his next book.	2000-08-30

This is Shirley's journey of one finding themselves, or re-discovering themselves  on the centuries old Camino - a 500 mile spiritual trek across Spain.<br />I  found this book to be wonderfully enlightening, illuminating, and I applaud  Shirley for the courage to complete this journey of the Spirit.  Shirley  says, \\"The Camino itself helps facilitate the resolution of emotional  issues.\\"<br />The reader is treated to flashbacks of Shirley's past lives as  she once lived along the Camino, including an amazing past life in Lemuria  and Atlantis.  I found Shirley's honesty and candor refreshing, and many of  her insights hit directly home with me.  I do believe that the reader will  also gain as many insights as I did and stop and let it all sink in.  We  are treated to her lessons and fears that she has to conquer as well.<br />I  really resonated with her thoughts on fear: \\"Never ask yourself what it is  you fear - instead ask yourself what it is that concerns you.  A fear  thought, put out, will return, because all energy returns to the sender.  Any energy always makes a loop until it regains the source.  A concern  thought will return also.  A that moment discern why you're concerned.\\"<br />I  began my spiritual questing with Shirley's first book and have devoured  everything she has written.  She is not afraid to speak her truth and she  is not afraid to seek to deepen her spirituality and then share the rest of  that with humanity.  I am sure that I am not the only one who she has  deeply and positively affected.  We are spiritual beings having a human  experience and once again we are reminded of our mission - to reconnect to  the Divine source - to love - to God.<br />Another wonderful quote, \\"I had  walked the Camino in order to understand what we were capable of as human  beings - such spiritual magnificence and such destructive fragmentation of  our own souls.  Were we all repeating such dramas even today because we  hadn't remembered what we came from?\\"<br />I urge everyone to read this  fascinating book.

Relating to a  significant other can be so much better and so much more nurturing  following the examples in this book.<br />I highly recommend this book and  find personally, that this book contains a WEALTH of information.

I know that a lot of the other reviewers did not, but I beg to differ.  The book was very funny, very moving, and had some very tender moments in it. I could not put this book down and had to  finish it before the day was over!  This would make a heck of a movie and  from what I gather here, it will be!<br />If you want a fast read on a  romantic tale - this is it with some mysticism thrown in.  The story was  very romantic and the dialogue, I thought, was witty and at times  provoking.  The incredibly hilarious dialogue between Arthur and his friend  Paul was so vivid that I was laughing out loud!  Few books make me do that.  I liked the quote, \\"I believe that everyday life with someone is the  ground in which true intimacy grows.\\" A tale attesting to the true love  between two people and the giving because of that love.  \\"Happiness is not  just there for the taking.  You're either a giver or a receiver.\\"<br />Sorry, but a for a die-hard romantic here, this story was great!  I  would love to see a sequel as well on the follow-up between Lauren and  Arthur. I guess we all search for that one true love, as Arthur was, and  when it ended for Arthur after he had indeed found that love, the reader  feels his loss and devastation - his pain is real.<br />Great book and I  highly recommend it!	2000-07-13

The book was very hard to put down and I was immediately drawn into the lives of all of the characters in Pine Bend.  I was captivated by  Ellie's quest in discovering her past as well as solving the mystery of the  disappearance of Mabel Beauvais, for the biography she was researching and  writing.  Wind held your attention until the very end, revealing Ellie's  past and at the same time, exposing the mystery of Mabel Beauvais'  disappearance.  Intertwining the unraveling past of both Ellie and Mabel,  combined with the steamy, sensual encounters with Ellie and Blue Reynard,  had the reader not wanting to put the book down.<br />I felt the issues going  on with all of the characters were real life and one could relate very  easily to them.  It was inevitable that the two main characters, Ellie and  Blue, would fall in love. But the anticipation by the author, and the  sensual build-up made for some very steamy scenes!  Yet, the issues of fear  and abandonment facing one of the characters could easily be related to,  which made this story come alive for the reader.  The intimate encounters  were very sensual and very steamy - need I say more?<br />As a first time Ruth  Wind reader, I thought the book wonderfully combined romance, mystery, and  pulled the reader directly into the heart of the little town of Pine Bend  and its inhabitants.  It was very easy to get lost in this book and forget  about everything else!  (Which I did! ).  I recommend this book highly and  I am looking forward to reading Ruth Wind's other books.	2000-07-11

I found The Alchemist to be a wonderful tale on pursuing one's dreams.  Coelho shows how easy it is to give up ever attaining one's dreams due to complacency - or not wanting to move out of one's comfort zone.  \\"People  are afraid to pursue their most important dreams, because they feel that  they don't deserve them, or that they'll be unable to achieve them.\\"  Another endearing quote from the book, \\"There is only one thing that makes  a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.\\"  Yet Santiago does  want to pursue his dream of finding his treasure and yes, at times we see  and feel his fear, but along his journey, he has learned to listen to his  heart and to trust what his heart teaches him.<br />\\"When a person really  desires something all the universe conspires to help that person to realize  his dream.\\"  Throughout the book, we see \\"omens\\" appearing in Santiago's  path, leading him to his dream.  Instead of ignoring these wonderful omens,  Santiago listens, observes, and follows the guidance set forth from his  heart.  He faces his fears, faces his demons, and he learns to trust.  He  is constantly tested along the way, yet he continues to listen to the  murmurings of his heart, which are never wrong. Santiago learns about love  along the way and helps others to face their fears as well.  Coelho states,  \\"And that's where the power of love comes in.  Because when we love, we  always strive to become better than we are.\\"<br />Some may see this fable as  contrite, or overworked or too new age for their tastes.  I disagree and  loved the messages that this book imparted, interwoven in the tale of the  desert, The Alchemist, and Santiago.  This book, I found, imparted to me  numerous jewels of wisdom.  I was captured and absorbed into the tale and  found myself relating to the fears, but I completely understood the message  of following one's dreams, listening to one's heart, trusting, loving and  learning to let go of fear.  \\"Listen to your heart.  It knows all things,  because it came from the Soul of the World, and it will one day return  there.  Wherever your heart is, that is where you'll find your treasure.  Your heart is alive.  Keep listening to what it has to say.\\"  The Alchemist  imparts these words of wisdom to Santiago when Santiago begins to doubt and  question.<br />\\"Everyone on earth has treasure that awaits him,\\" his heart  said. \\"We, people's hearts, seldom say much about those treasures, because  people no longer want to go in search of them.

The Secret of Shambhala is the best story yet, in Redfield's continuing saga of the Insights.  The journey was intriguing, fast paced, and yes, often times predictable, but the ending was great - I would never have  imagined it to end that way.  The story captivates your attention and will  have you pondering and wondering on the marvels of the Eleventh Insight.  This insight could very well be applied to life situations now.  I would be  curious to find out how many have tried and were successful!<br />I disagree  with the other reviewers on bringing the government into the story.  I  think that it adds to the suspense and one must realize that the country of  Tibet is not like our country in the sense of religious freedom that we  have.<br />This book contains many wisdom filled passages, which speak to the  heart.  In the chapter titled, The Life Process, I was captivated on the  \\"parenting\\" issues brought up.  Makes one stop and think.  \\"We choose our  parents in part to be awakened to what is missing, to what needs to be  added to human understanding, and we begin that process by being  dissatisfied with what we find in our lives with them.\\"<br />As many are  awakening to the spiritual consciousness that is blossoming on this planet,  we are learning that our thoughts as well as we are connected.  We are  learning that our thoughts are energy and we can influence our own lives.  This newest book by Redfield helps bring all of that into focus, expounds  on this concept and gives us a new tool to use in our spiritual evolution.  I highly recommend this book!	2000-07-05

This book will change your life and profoundly affect how you think about life after death.  Joel wrote this book after the passing of his much beloved  friend, Albert, by suicide.  The depth of their relationship was indeed one  of soul mates.  The love, passion, compassion, faith, and trust that are  expressed in this story will consume you.  The caring, kindness, and the  wisdom that was and still is lived on a daily basis will leave you crying.  Once you start reading this book, you won't be able to put it down!<br />The  soul connection experienced by Joel and Albert transcended death, as Albert  \\"contacted\\" Joel constantly.  This beautiful story proves that love  endures, that there is nothing more important than love.  Both of them had  made an agreement to contact the other one after the first one had died.  From beyond, Albert expressed so eloquently to Joel, \\"Know that each and  every moment of life matters and that they are the same in many ways.  Ways  you have not yet seen.  The good, the bad, the healthy days, the sick ones,  happy, sad, bored, or thrilled - they are the same.  With each and every  breath, and in every moment of life, you are working things out, things  that are connected to something far greater.  You are part of something  much bigger.  We are all part of this larger purpose.  Those kind people  and those cruel people all have a purpose you can't possibly understand  right now.  Each and every person matters, and each and every moment  matters.  The painful ones included.  We are all one.\\"  Albert's soothing  words gave Joel the impetus to fight his disease, to find the peace he was  searching for and to finally live in acceptance.<br />Joel's incredible  strength and determination helped him to surmount all of the \\"odds\\" given  to him by his doctors on his impending death from AIDS in 1990.  Albert  helped them both to conquer fear and doubt by their faith in the belief  \\"that this is not our path.\\"  The path was NOT one of dying and suffering,  but of living.  AIDS also gave Joel the opportunity to learn about  forgiveness - forgiveness of others, but more importantly, forgiveness of  one's self.  Dr. Cohen helped Joel \\"see\\" by explaining to him that without  forgiveness, we can keep the hurts inside \\"where they will fester and cause  disease, or we can make the conscious choice to let go of them for our own  sake.\\"  By letting go, Joel was able to bring restored health to his AIDS  racked body.  I applaud him on his extraordinary inner resolve and strength  as well as on his openness for forgiveness and change.  Joel is truly an  inspiration to those of us trying to conquer our own challenges that life  presents us.  My tears of sorrow, turned to tears of joy for Joel.<br />With  Joel's continued \\"signaling\\" from Albert, he began to find that he was  psychically beginning to receive messages from other souls that had passed,  to be relayed to his friends or even spontaneously to people that he would  happen to meet.  These episodes were fascinating to read and they indeed  brought great comfort to those who had lost a loved one.<br />I found this  book to be a beautiful tribute to the love that we share in our intimate  relationships, as well as to those in our family, and in our circle of  friends.  I found Joel to be such a strong, loving, warm, caring and  considerate person, and I felt that I knew him as one of my friends - I  just wanted to hug him!  The lessons imparted in this book will gently  nudge you to accept and to change- to let go.  I will leave you with this  most wondrous quote from Joel, \\"There will be pain and suffering for all of  us.  We have a choice in how we perceive it.  There will be moments of joy  and laughter and love.  It seems wise to look upon the pleasant moments of  life during the trying times.  It seems our best choice of perception.  Everything in life will pass.  No trouble will last forever.  Perhaps it is  the indescribable thing we call love that paves our way.  I cannot imagine  this journey without it.\\"  Thank you Joel.t forever.  Perhaps it is  the indescribable thing we call love that paves our way.  I cannot imagine  this journey without it.\\"  Thank you Joel.	2000-07-03

John Roger really helps facilitates the healing we all need to do on this issue.  Forgiveness of self is really expounded upon and had a profound effect on  me.  This book is full of compassion, wit and wisdom.  It is one of those  books that you will want to refer to again and again.  Just open to any  page and let the love and wisdom pour over you and heal you.  This book is  indeed a healing book.  There is a \\"gem\\" contained on each and every page.  God's eternal message of love and forgiveness is lovingly portrayed and no  where is blame or guilt to be found.<br />Teaching one with love and  compassion, we are guided to walk a path of love and not a path of revenge  and hate.  I just finished Joel Rothschild's book, Signals, where he, too  talks about forgiveness and how if one does not forgive, the anger and hate  can fester inside us and cause disease.  As John Roger states, \\"Don't  judge, forgive and then forget it.\\"<br />\\"As you change behavior, you change  the emotion.  As you change the emotion, you change the thinking.  As you  change the thinking, you're getting wisdom.  As you gain wisdom, you go  into forgiveness.\\"<br />This is an EXCELLENT book to bring you back into  forgiveness with gentleness.  Often, we are the roughest with ourselves.  Do something good for yourself - go out and get this book and be prepared  to have your heart opened.  Let the tears fall and open the way for  cleansing to begin.  You will NOT be disappointed.  One of the best books I  have read in a long time on forgiveness.  I highly recommend this book!	2000-07-03

Dan Brown has managed to combine The Vatican, the secret brotherhood of the Illuminati, murder, assassins, the Swiss research facility - CERN, a Harvard symbologist, stolen antimatter, a dead priest / physicist's  daughter who helped develop the antimatter, the Swiss Guard, and super high  speed aircraft, (from Boston to Switzerland in 1 hour! ) all in a race  against time.<br />This book is riveting, as the plot thickens and intensifies  and I found myself \\"peeking\\" into the next chapter - something I NEVER do!  The suspense was too much - but excellent!  I just could not put this book  down and had to let everything fall around me as I raced to finish all 430  pages!  The ending will blow you totally away - and just when you think  you had it all figured out - It will stun you!<br />I found the history of  the Vatican, the information on the conclave in electing a pope, as well as  all of the history, combined with the history of the Illuminati totally  fascinating.  My interest never waned throughout this fast-paced,  compelling story.  I really don't want to retell the story, as you can read  it in the above editorial review.<br />Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor  of religious iconology and Vittoria Vetra, a physicist are in a race  against time to save Vatican City from a diabolical plot - revenge and  hatred from the ancient brotherhood of the Illuminati against the Catholic  Church.  With the Pope murdered, the four favored bishops are found missing  from the conclave.  At precise intervals, the Illuminati inform the Vatican  that the bishops will be murdered.  It is up to Langdon and Vittoria to try  and figure out the \\"clues\\" from the Illuminati and save the bishops. But  not only are they trying to save the bishops, they are also trying to save  the entire Vatican, as stolen antimatter is hidden somewhere inside the  Vatican.  Time is also running out as the antimatter has the capacity to  level the entire city.  Antimatter \\"is the most powerful energy source  known to man.  A single gram of antimatter contains the energy of a  20-kilotin nuclear bomb - the size of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.\\"<br />You  will find this book totally fascinating and incredibly compelling.

This first book covers his formative years through age 7.  This book depicts in  graphic details the horrific abuse that Dave lived through at the hands of  his psychotic and alcoholic mother.  I had actually read the second book,  The Lost Boy first and then went back to read the first one.  I could not  read this book continually.  I had to dry my tears, put the book down, and  take a deep breath.  Just when you thought that the abuse could not get  worse, the abuse, in fact, unfortunately does get worse.  How this child  survived and lived is a miracle in itself. How he found the strength to  cope, and to endure is beyond my imagination.  His incredible strength is  testament to the man who he is today.  I can hardly wait to read the third  book in the series, A Man Called Dave.<br />This book sites the abuse that  Dave suffered as the third worst case of abuse in the history of the state  of California. This book will have you crying at what he endured and lived  through.  Ironically, Dave's mother did not start out as mentally disturbed  and he recalls loving memories of his mother for the first 4 or 5 years of  his life.  Your heart will break as you live through his torture - from  being stabbed, to burned, to enduring the gas chamber of Clorox and ammonia  fumes, to being made to sit as a prisoner of war, to being made to drink  ammonia, to being starved, beaten, as well as being degraded by being  called \\"it\\" or \\"the boy\\" instead of his name. The dog in the family was  actually treated better than this child was.  You will cheer when he  outwitted his mother and won small, but short-lived victories.  His father  was no better and \\"allowed\\" his wife to abuse this child.<br />I realize  that social services are much better today than they were over 20 years  ago, but I have to ask why?  Why didn't anybody notice much sooner how this  child was dressed, and how he smelled, and all of the bruises on his body  and why he always stole food?<br />This heart-wrenching tale will leave you  speechless at times. Yet, in the end, one reads of Dave's accomplished  military career and his involvement in helping the youth of today.  All I  can say is God bless you Dave.  You are an incredible person to have  endured, to have survived and to not have given up.  I commend you.<br />This  book is excellent and it will, as well as Dave Pelzer will, make a  permanent impact on your heart.sooner how this  child was dressed, and how he smelled, and all of the bruises on his body  and why he always stole food? <br />This heart-wrenching tale will leave you  speechless at times.

I feel so inspired after reading this book, so ready to put into practice what this powerful, little book is teaching.  This \\"classic\\" has been around since the turn of the century and it seems  to be even more relevant in today's stressful and competitive society.  I  underlined so many wonderful and inspiring passages that I intend to refer  to on a daily basis.  As Allen states, \\"a man is literally what he thinks\\",  or as the saying goes, garbage in, garbage out!  Or put another way, \\"All  that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result  of his own thoughts.\\"<br />I have learned that I cannot blame others for my  life, or my state of affairs - they are my creation, the end product of my  thoughts and actions.  Allen states that man makes or unmakes himself by  the thoughts he keeps and cultivates.  Man is truly is his own worst  enemy!<br />I really resonated to his quote on fear, \\"Thoughts of doubt and  fear never accomplish anything, and never can.  They always lead to  failure.  Purpose, energy, power to do, and all strong thoughts cease when  doubt and fear creep in.\\"  How profound and how true.  How we let fear run  our lives - again proving how powerful our thoughts can be.  Allen further  expounds by saying, \\"He who has conquered doubt and fear has conquered  failure.\\"<br />The garden of our mind is only cultivated by us.  What kind  of crop we want to consistently yield is solely determined on our positive,  enriching, and encouraging thoughts or on our doubting, destructive and  negative ones.  We alone hold the key to our future, and our success, and  our attainments in life.  We can either have a feast or a famine - it is  only up to us.<br />This highly inspirational book cannot help but to motivate  you in some degree.  I feel like I have been given the keys to a door that  was once rusty and would not open, but now will yield freely in my hand.  Another great quote is, \\"The Vision that you glorify in your mind, the  Ideal that you enthrone in your heart - this you will build your life by,  this you will become.\\"  This is one book that you will want to keep  constantly by your side, especially for those times when you get  discouraged, or when the road seems rough.  Just reading one page will have  you having a change of heart, with its motivation putting you back on that  right path.<br />This book is a MUST read if you are desiring to change your  negatives into positives!

The passions expressed were poignant, with the author's mind reliving his past in order to contain his sanity in the present.  His descriptives were superb - his strength  inspiring.  To have the world in the palm of your hand on one day and the  next day, you are virtually a prisoner, locked inside your own body.  His  despair was masked with humor and wit and never once did he feel sorry for  himself to the point of anguish.  Would I have been as courageous as he in  the same situation?<br />This is quick read, divided into numerous chapters,  each a little tale in its own.  You will laugh and you will cry - to  realize that life as you know it can be taken from you in a heartbeat and  you will be forever changed.  His beauty expresses itself through his prose  as the reader can see his mind is totally intact, alas, it is his body that  binds him.  One's compassion is elevated as his sensitivity shines though  as well, masking the sadness of the knowledge of death slowly making its  way to his door.<br />An excellent book that will tug at your heart.  It will  also heighten your sensitivity to the fact that despite his disabilities,  he still needed the comfort and love of friends and family.  The  realization that some &quot;friends&quot; could not accept his condition  and chose not to visit touched me deeply.  He needed love around him more  than ever.	2000-06-22

He chronicles his journey  from Brazil, with his wife Chris, and their 40-day sojourn in the Mojave  Desert, seeking the Valkyries.  The Valkyries were rumored to be able to  speak and to see their angels.  Having fought a battle with darkness, Paulo  has redeemed his life and is a seeker of the light.  Paulo was also told  that \\"people wind up killing what they love most\\" as he seeks to rectify  certain, if not all, areas of his life.<br />This book is journey of faith, of  trust, of forgiveness, of love, of self-discovery, and of battling the  darkness within ourselves, and wanting to change.  As Paulo states, \\"Faith  is a different conquest, and it requires daily combat in order to  maintained.\\"  His faith is tested to the very end, as he seeks contact with  his angels.  His journey within transforms him as well as transforming his  wife at the same time.  Their two soul journeys will inspire you.<br />\\"We are  responsible for everything that happens in this world.  We are the warriors  of the light.  With the strength of our love and our will, we can change  our destiny, as well as the destiny of many others.\\"  In this age of angel  sightings, angel occurrences are happening with intense frequency.  It is  as if God is sending his messengers with a message and that message if one  of love.  The stories being written give hope to those in need of hope and  bring home the message that there is another way - love.<br />\\"If on the other  hand, we accept all that is wrong about us - and despite it, believe that  we are desiring of a happy life - then we will have thrown open an immense  window that will allow Love to enter.  Little by little, our defects will  disappear, because one who is happy can look at the world only with love -  the force that regenerates everything that exists in the universe.\\"<br />This  is an amazing book, which will cause you to think and revaluate parts of  your life.

I am glad I did. Faith of Our Fathers chronicles John McCain's  Grandfather and Father, two incredibly impressive Naval Admirals in our  country's history. I found the history of his father and grandfather,  lively, amusing and very, very interesting. The chronicles were  exceptionally written and lively - not at all boring and dry.<br />John's  candor and honesty on his expectations of following in the tradition of his  forbearers at the Naval Academy, as well as filling unwritten expectations,  and the high expectations that he placed on himself was a captivating read.  Living so close to the Academy myself, it is even more interesting to read  of life in the &quot;Yard&quot; and the strict discipline of the military.  After reading this book, I know understand so much more.<br />I was too young  when Vietnam was really going on and vaguely recall the POWs being  released. Nonetheless, I now have a new found admiration for these men and  McCain goes to great lengths to name quite a few of these men and bestow  recognition and thanks to all of them. I never quite understood the  &quot;military code&quot; and again, came away with admiration and  understanding for the men in the military and that entire way of life. In  our day and age of high tech, it was refreshing to read of  &quot;heroes&quot; and &quot;patriotism&quot;. Our country could use more  of these kinds of men and women.<br />I was laughing and crying throughout  this book and it was so heart wrenching to read of the POWs, but their  faith and belief was inspiring, and the term heroes kept coming to mind,  yes heroes - very much so. A quote that appealed to me from McCain,  &quot;Nothing in life is more liberating than to fight for a cause larger  than yourself, something that encompasses you but is not defined by your  existence alone.&quot; Another one - &quot;But in Vietnam I had come to  understand how brief a moment a life is. For I had learned that you can  fill the moment with purpose and experiences that will make your life  greater than the sum of its days. I had learned to acknowledge my failings  and to recognize opportunities for redemption.&quot;<br />McCain is  incredibly hard on himself for signing a confession and no one can fault or  judge him for doing that. Put in his position, the torture and beatings for  over 6 years - what would any of us have done? The sheer will and  determination combined with the unbelievable hope, faith, and love of their  country, as well as each other, kept these men alive.<br />This remarkable  story left me with admiration for the McCain men. Each generation has left  an indelible mark on the continued freedom of this country. Each of these  men showed what honor is and that honor was passed to each generation.<br />I  highly recommend this book to anyone - you will definitely walk away with a  profound sense of admiration and new perspective on our military - I know I  did.ence alone.&quot; Another one - &quot;But in Vietnam I had come to  understand how brief a moment a life is.

I  have to ask myself what would have become of these precious children if it  were not for the Anglin's?

The Messengers is an incredible, true story that will leave you amazed and wanting more!  Thank goodness Nick Bunick has another equally excellent book out, In God's Truth, which I also highly recommend reading after this  book!  The Messengers offers solid &quot;proof&quot;, if you are one that  needs &quot;proof&quot;, of the existence of angels and their assistance in  our lives. God works in mysterious ways and we only need to ask for  help.<br />I was totally fascinated with Nick's journey with the angels, his  friend's encounters with the angels and how one's higher power intervenes  and helps out in our lives. The passages were written with such descriptive  clarity, that I thought that I was right there.  The angel encounters were  so incredible - I am at a loss for words!<br />I applaud Nick for sharing  his beautiful story with the rest of the world.  It is so interesting to  read about Paul and how man has changed the Bible and the dogma and rules  that have been put in place for religion.  It saddens me to think that it  was never meant to be this way at all.<br />This is a book with a message and  that message is love - pure and simple.  The message is also about trust  and faith and living our lives differently. This is a book that will leave  you with many questions as well as questioning yourself.  It will linger  with you for days and gently tap you on the shoulder with a reminder of a  &quot;444&quot; or &quot;111&quot; experience!  Truely!<br />If there are only  two books you read this year, read BOTH of Nick Bunick's books - and your  life will be forever changed.	2000-06-14

This book is no exception.  Many topics are covered here - and not just grief from the death of a loved one.  Van  Praagh covers divorce, loss of pets, passages, and grief resulting from  destruction.<br />He gently and lovingly guides one through the grief and  reminds us once again, that we need to grieve, in our own way and in our  own time - eveyone is different.  Our society tends to hasten the grief  process and does not seem to honor what each and every one of us needs to  heal.  &quot;We need to accept the loss in order  begin the healing  process.  All grief needs to be felt and realized.&quot;<br />&quot;Let your  grief become an opportunity for your soul to grow.&quot;  Van Praagh  illustrates that each soul is on a unique path, a unique jouney.  When that  soul's mission is accomplished, that soul goes &quot;home&quot; to God -  yet the soul continues to live on - it is just the physical body which  dies.<br />This book will bring immense comfort in the loss of loved one  through death, through divorce or even through a relationship ending.  We  deal with the grief, grow and move on.  To NOT deal with the grief, is to  stagnate.<br />There are many wonderful illustrations from different readings  which Van Praagh has done with family members which have lost a loved one.  The love that comes through is just amazing.  Love never dies - it is  eternal.<br />I found this book extremely beneficial, healing and  transforming. I found that there is grief still left in me from losing  loved ones that I now need to express.  &quot;In order to continue life in  any meaningful way, you must allow yourself to grieve.&quot;<br />The shock  that one goes through when dealing with a loss is not often understood by  others, yet one gets condemned for acting stupid or for doing stupid things  by others.  My compassion level as well as my patience has enabled me to  more understanding of my past actions and behaviors by reading this section  on the shock effect of grief.  My eyes are now opened to a new level of  compassion and understanding for myself as well as for others.  Thank  you.<br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough!  The comfort that it has  brought me is 10 stars!  &quot;Tears clean the windows of the soul.  Grieving is a great opportunity to grow, to understand and to explore  ourselves.&quot;e understanding of my past actions and behaviors by reading this section  on the shock effect of grief.

This book was a fascinating read, as Dr. Moody really explored and explained the entire phenomena of Near Death Experiences - from children, to combat veterans, as well as why  it is NOT a mental illness.  He also introduced NDE researchers from across  the country, what kind of research they are doing as well as providing very  detailed NDE experiences of these researchers.  The book also contained an  incredible variety of NDE examples from people who have &quot;died&quot;  and have come back.<br />Once again, the timely messages of love come through  from those who have experienced an NDE and Dr. Moody makes a great case for  life after death.  This is the fifth book on NDEs that I have read and I  have completely changed my attitude towards death and the life after.  The  fear is no longer there.<br />What I continue to find most fascinating is the  way in which people change for the better after having an NDE.  Their  &quot;new&quot; outlook and attitude on life is amazing and  transforming.<br />This book will comfort those who have lost a loved one and  it will also explain many aspects of the NDE.  I found this book to be an  enjoyable read and I did not want to put the book down.  I HIGHLY recommend  this book.	2000-06-08

In this book, she has a visitation by an archangel, who is concerned about the spiritual state of mankind.  Coming to Mary, he feels  that her words will be able to awaken mankind and to help them  &quot;turnaround&quot; their negative behavior.<br />I do believe that Mary's  words impact millions of people as she has always lovingly written of the  truth and has helped us see the truth.<br />The book is a fast read and  expounds upon the Ten Commandments.  The archangel goes into the  &quot;simplicity&quot; of each one and how mankind has chosen to disregard  these rules from God and explains what can be done to turn things  around.<br />I just finished reading In God's Truth by Nick Bunick and along  with this book by Mary Summer Rain, I feel that man has turned around the  words of God and man has used these words in ways that God did not intend  to be used.  The simple words of faith and love have become distorted and  as mentioned in the book, we have become an &quot;I&quot; and and a  &quot;me&quot; generation.<br />This is a book of hope, of looking at where  one is and where one needs to go.  It is a book of introspection and asking  of yourself &quot;what is really, really important in my life?&quot;  Am I  living my life as God wants me to?  Would I do the things right now if God  were standing right next to me?<br />Some pretty heavy issues in this book,  bring up some major questions.  You *will* question yourself and some of  the answers you come up with will hopefully have you changing around your  life.<br />I recommend this book enthusiastically.	2000-05-30

I had finished reading The Messengers and my soul cried for more from Nick Bunick.  In God's Truth is filled with truth and  beauty and you will be forever changed after reading it.  You will WANT to  make changes in your life.<br />Nick discovered his past life as Paul who was  with Jesus over 2,000 years ago.  The &quot;truthful&quot; insight gained  by his past life regression will have you thinking, questioning, and  grieving.  Grieving in that Jesus' message of love and compassion has been  turned into fear and guilt by various religions, going back to the medieval  church to control the people.  It is now time as Nick says, to unlock that  door of Fear which keeps us rooted and unable to open up our minds and eyes  and really &quot;see&quot; and &quot;know&quot;.<br />This is one book that  you will want to refer to constantly as well as refer it to others.  Nick  has a beautiful prayer at the end as well as a very magical spiritual  healing.<br />I was constantly amazed at each and every chapter, but  especailly on the chapters of Jesus and the Bible.<br />As the new millenium  brings forward more spiritual consciousness, Nick Bunick has been blessed  to help bring this consciousness to others.  His encounters with angels is  fascinating and touching and Nick shares some of his guided writings with  the readers.  I strongly recommend his first book, The Messengers, in which  Nick details his encounters of the angels and God in his life.  Just  incredible.<br />This has got to be one of the best books I have read in a  long time and I intended to re-read it again.  This book is filled with  love, compassion and caring and speaks of Jesus' ministry as Jesus meant it  to be.  I strongly urge religious leaders to read and embrace this book.  This is NOT a book asking or telling you to stop your religion, but instead  to look at how Jesus' words have been changed through the centuries to fit  others ideas of how things should be.  Another good book that also address  this theme is The Visitation by Mary Summer Rain.<br />I believe we are being  called back into the love of Jesus and Nick Bunick is donig all that he can  to ensure that this accomplished!  Thank you Nick for opening my heart and  eyes and mind.hrough the centuries to fit  others ideas of how things should be.

This is the third book of Ms. Anderson's that I have read and am once again amazed and inspired.  Her stories are stories of beauty, faith and love and each and every one cannot help but fill one with faith and hope.<br />&quot;For nothing is impossible with God.&quot;  We are reminded once  again, the love that God has for us and we need only ask and we shall  receive.<br />My favorite story was Triumph In The Sky, the story of a  baby's journey to receive a liver transplant and the pilot who aided him on  his journey.<br />Miracles do happen.  As Joan says, &quot;His light is  eternal.  His love prevails.&quot;<br />All the stories are beautiful and I  recommend this book highly.

But the title echoed home and it called out to me.  Once starting this book, I could not put it down and  finished it in the wee hours of the morning.  I then cried.<br />This is an  EXCELLENT book for all women, but especially for those of you who have been  abused or are being abused and DO NOT want to look at reality in the eye.  If your eyes are closed, like mine were, this book will compassionately and  lovinging open them up and empower you.  It took me so long to get out of  an abusive situation with 3 children, and like Michele's the abuse still  continues, even though the divorce is final.  Michele portrays in her story  that abuse knows no &quot;class&quot; boundaries - it strikes everyone.  Yet, why do we wait so long to remove ourselves from these situations?  I  guess it is an individual answer.<br />I felt many of the emotions and pain  and situations that Michele felt and could just relate so very much to her  situation.<br />I cannot thank her enough for being brave and bold enough to  share her story with women.  This is a MUST read for all people involved  with helping women in domestic violence situations.<br />This book will OPEN  your eyes if they are shut and I encourage you to read this book for your  sake or for those of you who know women who are being abused and for some  reason cannot or are unable to leave.<br />This book will DEFINITELY help you  heal and/or start you on the path of healing.<br />Thank you Michele - I  applaud and commend you.	2000-05-27

This book is, to me, a more &quot;scientific&quot; type of explanation, written by an MD, but nonetheless, quite fascinating and  very interesting.  Recommended reading if you are interested in finding out  more about NDEs.<br />Again, reports of people who have had NDEs, the message  is the same - kindness and love as taught by Jesus.  People's lives are  forever changed after having an NDE.<br />Moody goes into more explanations  and actually posts the questioins and answers, that I, as a reader, was  asking as well!<br />I especially liked the subject on suicide, in which Dr.  Moody interviewed subjects who had attempted suicide, had a NDE and came  back to &quot;live&quot;.  All said that is was wrong and they would never  do it again.  We are God's gift, doing His duty here on earth.  Suicide  opposses God.  Pretty hefty message in this chapter.<br />Because of his  research, readers and others might be looking for Dr. Moody to  &quot;prove&quot; that there is life after death.  He quite clearly  explains that that is not his intent, yet offers his own views on the  subject.  You, the reader, can judge for yourselves and claim your own  beliefs.  Yet, after reading numerous books on the subject, (I am currently  reading 2 more of Dr. Moody's books),it is very hard to doubt the  existence.  I leave you with this quote from Dr. Moody's book, &quot;I  believe it lies within the realm of possibility that, in a similiar  fashion, almost everyone may eventually come to accept intellectually, even  without definite proof, that there is another dimension of existence into  which the soul passes at death.  Remember that it is our own anxiety about  whether death is final which shows through when we challenge a person who  has had such an experience to &quot;prove&quot; that there is life after  death.&quot;	2000-05-27

God has told us, &quot;Ask and ye  shall receive&quot;, and that includes the asking for help for our loved  ones and for ourselves.<br />This is a book that will renew your faith and  reaffirm God's love for us.  It is at the darkest times of our lives, when  we feel alone and abandoned, that we are loved the most.  Help is there and  we just have to ask for it.  As Joan Anderson says, &quot;...that, whatever  their failings, God is holding them gently in the palm of His  hand.&quot;<br />Reading the numerous stories, you will discover that angels  can take many forms and not just the heavenly beings we were taught about  as children.<br />Read this book to renew your spirit, increase your faith and  to uplift your life.  You will NOT be disappointed.  This book is a gem.  And remember that you are loved and that miracles do indeed happen!	2000-05-24

Neenan is confronted by Michael an angel resembling Michael  Jordan, who contracts with Neenan in changing his life before his impending  death.  Neenan must completely change each close familial relationship in  his life, which has become damaged due to his quest for more power,  conquests and more money.<br />Greely intertwines his descriptive and lively  characters around two equally lively and descriptive angels, doing all they  can to insure Neean turns his life around.  Greely combines adventure,  suspense, mystery and romance for one memorable tale of hope and the  message of God's love ever present in our lives.  His message of  forgiveness, love, and renewal bring one back to the realization that we  are never alone, we are never forgotten and that we are loved.<br />I  thoroughly recommend this book and you will have to read the book for the  suspenseful ending!

The Lost Boy is an absolutely amazing true story of Dave Pelzer, which chronicles his years from 12 to 18 years of age as a foster child.  This is book two of three and now I must go and read the other two books in the  trilogy.  I could not put this book down.  I would recommend this book to  everyone.<br />This will book will make you cry, it will make you mad, and at  the end, you will be cheering and crying tears of joy for Dave.  This book  will break your heart and if you are a parent, you will be outraged at the  abuse.  Sadly, child abuse is so prevalent, and there are so many cunning,  and devious parents out there, that some children do not get out and the  abuse is \\"allowed\\" to go on and on or the child is killed.<br />Dave's  strength, determination, and unbreakable spirit shine throughout this book.  How he survived the brutality can only be called a miracle.  It breaks my  heart to read of such incredible abuse and one does have to thank the  foster parents, social works and teachers in this child's life.  Dave says,  \\"It takes a community to save a child\\", and I wholeheartedly agree.<br />Dave  takes you through his five different foster families during his adolescent  years and his desperate determination to find the love of a family and a  \\"home\\" propels him by not abandoning hope.<br />Dave's inner strength,  courage, and fortitude are a shining inspiration to us all.

The Phantom of Manhattan is a \\"sequel\\" to the Phantom of the Opera, but this sequel is not written, of course, by the original author, Gaston Leroux, but by the well-known author Frederick Forsyth.<br />Forsyth has  managed to capture the \\"original\\" flavor of Leroux and has written, in my  opinion, a most unforgettable sequel.  With Andrew Lloyd Webber's  phenomenal success of the musical Phantom, the popularity of \\"Phantom\\" is  world known and loved.  Forsyth and Webber actually spoke about how the  Phantom tale could continue and the result of those conversations is this  incredible book!  This book will also capture and entice the ranks of  Phantom lovers and I would love to see a movie from this book.<br />The  Phantom of Manhattan picks right up where the original left off with the  Phantom, Erik fleeing the scene after abducting Christine during a scene in  her operatic debut.  Forsyth manages to weave his tale with bits of  mystery, suspense, and romance and he certainly keeps you guessing!  I  don't want to give away keys elements of the tale, but I was sure intrigued  and managed to read this book in 2 days!  The character development was  superb, and the author kept the characters to only a few key players.  The  book's chapters are told by the individual characters which adds to the  flavor and drama of the story.<br />This tale is masterfully told and with a  great preface, speaking to the original tale of Leroux.  He manages to give  you more of a background, which adds to this book immensely.<br />This is a  very good book and I would highly recommend it.  It is a tale of unrequited  love with an incredible ending!<br />I have to disagree with most all of the  other reviews that I have read.  I did not read this book looking to  critique Forsyth, but on the contrary, as a sequal to the Phantom.  Yes, it  was a different &quot;kind&quot; of book for Forsyth, but I found it very  intriguing and enjoyable.<br />I highly recommend this book!	2000-05-10

Betty's amazing journey while she had \\"died\\" is truly extraordinary.  After reading this book and the 2 books by Dannion  Brinkley, I would have to say that I do not have a fear of dying!  Dying is  just the start of the next stage of one's life - not something to be  feared.  Our spirit lives on, and just sheds the physical body.<br />Our  society thinks of death and speaking of death as \\"taboo\\".  Yet Betty shows  us that death is beautiful and loving.  The love Betty experienced just  overwhelms you and her love comes through this book to you.  You cannot  help but cry.  There are many quotes in this book that you will definitely  want to write down.  This book will definitely change your life in someway  and bring great comfort for those you have recently lost a loved one.  Betty's life was forever changed because of this experience and her  awareness and love of God shines through.  It is amazing to me how many of  us were raised to think of an angry, vengeful and hurting God, yet this is  never seen by those who see God in the NDE.  Again, Betty is her own worst  judge as she reviews her life - not God or the light beings that she  meets.<br />Melvin Morse, MD, another author/pioneer in the NDE field wrote a  most inspiring introduction to the book.  He describes this book as \\"a  journey into the meaning of this life.\\"  He also states that this book  teaches us \\"that our own individual lives are important and filled with  meaning.\\"  Those returning back from NDE's bring back the simple and  beautiful messages - \\"Love is supreme. . .  Love must govern. . . We create  our own surrounding by the thoughts we think . . .  We are sent her to live  life fully, to live it abundantly, to find joy in our own creations, to  experience both failure and success, to use free will to expand and magnify  our lives.\\"<br />Once again, simple, timeless messages are brought back and  those are of love, kindness, service and forgiveness.  Nothing new, just  presented in a different way, through a different messenger.  As Betty says  of the \\"clearly expressed Savior's message, Above all else, love one  another.\\"<br />I cannot recommend this book enough.  I actually had to read it  two times to make sure that I did not miss anything!  It is glorious and  the scenes that she paints when she is in the Garden, is remarkable.  Passages of the book with stay with you, uplifting and encouraging you. You  will think of this book during the day, as Betty's words slowly sink into  your soul and ignite.  This book can and will have transforming effects -  it can't be helped!<br />Betty, even though it took you 19 years to share  these experiences with the world - I for one am glad that you did and the  difference you are making with others is astounding.

What can I say about the quintessential love story?  Boy meets girl, girl meets boy,  parents separate them and then they meet again years later, get married,  and live happily ever after.<br />Only with Nicholas Sparks as the author,  this story is different.  You are immediately captivated into the story,  reliving it, feeling it and savoring each and every emotion.  It is a  sensory experience reading this story and you feel like you become Noah or  Allie, the main characters, the soul mates.  By the end of the book, tears  are sure to be shed, deep sighs emitted and then one is left thinking is  such a love possible and where does one find a love like this?<br />This is a  beautiful love story, with all the emotions to hook you from the get-go.  The sensitivity of the author is clearly portrayed in Noah and Allie.  Nicolas Sparks weaves his magic with this story, which is based on his  wife's \\"beloved grandparents.\\"<br />I absolutely loved this story and I am not  a big romance reader.

He has managed to write another excellent book of his near death experiences, his journeys and the messages he received from the Beings of Light.  This second book is filled with  love, compassion and guidance, as was the first book.  As Dannion says,  \\"Love is the important thing there is.\\" \\"All you need to realize is that  love is powerful.  Its expression is treating others the way they want to  be treated.\\"  I read this book and then had to go back and read his first  book.  Then I had to read this book once again.

I find people's experiences of near-death  experiences quite fascinating and this book is no exception.<br />Dannion does  repeat a lot of what was contained in the first book, but I found that he  went into much more detail in this book.  The story behind the story, so to  speak.  I really came away with deeper understanding and compassion for all  that he had gone through.  I thought it was extremely interesting when he  told about helping his so called \\"friends\\" with his new gifts.  His work  with hospice is extraordinary. He is relentless, committed to his life's  mission and does not give up.  Considering what he has and had gone  through, he has had valid reasons for giving up.

Our children and the dying can teach us so much, if we  only take the time to listen!  After reading his book, I wanted to  volunteer my time with hospice and one day I hope to do that.<br />I find  Dannion to be a most compassionate and remarkable man.  Again we are  treated to those ancient but timely messages of love, forgiveness, and  kindness to our fellow man.  I applaud him in reaching out to others with  his messages.

But as the author states in his preface - \\"you have been forewarned\\".  I don't read many fiction books, yet when I do, I tend  to stick to favorite authors and Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorites.  I  was hooked after reading Message In A Bottle - another tearjerker.<br />I am a  hopeless romantic and I usually don't read romance books, but this book is  superb for all of you other hopeless romantics.  This book will tear at  your heartstrings and will linger with you for days.  I could not put this  book down and read it in two days.  I was immediately captivated and  transported into Landon Carter's world in the late 1950's.  Landon does an  incredible amount of \\"growing up\\" during his seventeenth year of life. The  minister's daughter, Jamie Sullivan, helps him to transform from a selfish,  self-absorbed \\"kid\\", to a young adult on the verge of manhood.  Landon  conveys traits of tenderness, and compassion, and learns about love and  faith and how to forgive, while his love blossoms for Jamie. Jamie is able  to bring out all that is pure and good from Landon.  It is this innocent  love that is all consuming that helps to foster Landon's growth and wisdom.<br />Jamie may be portrayed in the book as a \\"goodie two-shoes\\", but her  innocence, her unnerving faith and trying to live her life as God wanted us  all to live, endears her to the reader.<br />The book may be predictable in  parts, but that does not deter from the beauty of this story.  In the  conclusion, Landon realizes what love is and what it really means to love  another by helping  your love's dream become a reality.  Landon's heart  softens when he lets his true nature come through and shine - and shine it  does. Epitome of true love - most definitely!  With Landon's  transformation complete, the reader is completely absorbed with these two  main characters.  You can't help but fall in love with them.<br />Nicholas  Sparks - I congratulate you on another most tender and endearing story.<br />I absolutely love this book and recommend it heartily.  This is a must  read kind of book that can't help but uplift you as well.

He was able to read it without a problem and we both  enjoyed the adventures, most often times hilarious, of Frog and Toad.<br />I  love Arnold Lobel's books for children and have read many of them to my  children throughout the years.

It is thekind of book that you want to refer to again and again as well as tohand it out to other people.  Marshall's writing and poetry conveysensitivity, awareness, comfort, and upliftment and are amazingly profound.  I read the book in one sitting and was crying through most of the book!  I was so touched at a deep level.  The simplistic messages of the beauty of God and of love come across so sweetly. Marshall's insights and caring are remarkable for a young child.  He is truly gifted.  God has blessed him and in turn Marshall has blessed us with God's messages.  It is said that our children are indeed our teachers and this child, so filled with love, teaches purely from the heart.  The wisdom contained in his writings, reminds one of an \\"old soul\\".  I commend his parents and relatives for fostering his talent and thank them for allowing the rest of the world to bask in Marshall's teachings of love.  Marshall's \\"poetry is the magnificent kindness of the heart\\".<br />In the forward by Dr. Laurence A. Becker, I was so moved by his reflection of Marshall's parents.  \\"I am convinced that it came about primarily through the powerful and unconditional love of his family who refused to see him as incomplete in any way.  They acted toward him as the perfect being they see him to be.  They acted as though he were already the magnificent being he has come to be.\\"<br />And as Marshall says, \\"Will we free the world to think perfectly about the listening and marvelous children?\\" Just imagine the possibilities for future generations if our love were indeed unconditional.<br />I found this book to be a great comfort for me at this point in my life.  I learned so much from this angelic teenager and now I am learning how to listen. I cannot recommend this book enough and I know that the reader will be profoundly moved on many levels.<br />Marshall you are a gift to us all and I eagerly anticipate your next book!  Just please don't wait too long!'t wait too long!	2000-05-02

It is avery basic book, nothing sophisticated, and my 4th grader was able to read it without a problem.  The book was actually an enjoyable read and I learned quite a lot about Cousteau, whom I have admired for a long time.  The book was accompanied by black and white pencil drawings, which added to the enjoyability of the book.<br />Because this book did not go into immense detail, it would not be appropriate for someone doing a school project requiring lots of dates and details.<br />For any child who wants to learn more about Jacques Cousteau, my son and I would both recommend this book as a very good introduction.  Personally, after reading the book, I would like to read an \\"adult\\" book to learn more about this most determined and fascinating man.	2000-05-01

Burton's endearing tale reminiscences about a  particular Christmas for him in Wales.  Burton draws the reader in  immediately with his descriptive style and one is right there with little  Rich, as he is called, experiencing the entire scene. I felt so completely  drawn into the story.  The reader follows and feels little Rich's fear and  anxiety and the mystery surrounding this particular Christmas.  We are  surprised at the end of the book with his first presented gift on the Eve  of Christmas!<br />I would have loved to read more from Richard Burton, but  alas, this is the only piece that he has ever written.  Suffice to say that  his style is quite captivating and resonates with rich descriptions.<br />The book contains an afterward by his widow, Sally Burton, which  provides the reader an even more intimate glimpse into his early childhood,  including his mother and his 12 additional siblings!  He is number 12 in  the pecking order and became orphaned at the age of two. His older sister  raised him and the love he feels towards her is very evident in the book;  in fact, he does adores her.  I am grateful for this little insight, which  helped to clarify this tale even more.  The reader is also treated to  pictures of little Rich and his sister, Cis who raised him.<br />I found this  \\"little\\" tale in this \\"little\\" book most delightful!	2000-04-29

I would say that after reading this book, which by the way, I could not put down until I finished it, Dannion was indeed  \\"saved by the light\\".  What I found so fascinating was the turn-around -  the total turn around of his life.  I had heard about life reviews before,  but the impact for me, was that not only do we get to review our life, but  also get to review how the other person felt whom we were hurting, whether  it be conscious or unconscious.  How our actions have a \\"ripple effect\\" in  the world. I can only imagine what pain that must be.  I was also  especially moved by the messages that the book imparts, messages of God's  love and kindness and forgiveness.  These messages are old, yet they have  spanned time and remain true today in the new millennium and I feel, are  needed more than ever.  Dannion's will to survive, and his peacefulness on  accepting death helped me see that we are indeed much more than our human  bodies.  I commend him on his hospice work and sharing with us that death  is a time for love and forgiveness.  He shows us that death is a healing  time for all families and that death is actually the beginning of our next  life, our next adventure.  Nothing to fear, but to embrace instead.  The  quote that most inspired me from the book from the Being of Light is, \\"What  you are is the difference that God makes.  And that difference is love.\\"  This is a book that needs to be passed on and on and on!  I cannot  recommend it enough.  For those who have recently lost a love one, this  book will provide immeasurable comfort for you.	2000-04-27
