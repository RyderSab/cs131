US	49738138	R2KMV1BEKQQPMN	0425201082	233898538	Beneath Still Waters	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Not bad	The town of Goulden's Falls, long sunken beneath the surface of a man-made lake, harbors a terrible secret.  As the fiftieth anniversary of the dam approaches, the forgotten horror awakens, drawing two independent journalists into its orbit. <br /> <br />This is one of those cheap paperback originals with garish covers that there seemed to be so many of in the 80s.  Largely forgotten, they now gather dust on the shelves of used book stores if they still exist at all.  This novel actually succeeds as an efficient, effective little thriller for much of its length.  By the end, however, it becomes clear that author Matthew J. Costello has no way to end it other than by falling back on the hoariest of B-movie cliches.  Until that point, though, it evokes some pretty good shudders, particularly in scenes wherein divers explore the submerged town.	2005-10-01

There are the dangerous lifeforms of the planet Genellan, where an overcrowed Earth is attempting to establish its first colony.  There are the kones, natives of another planet in the the same system, who are ambivalent about the arrival of the human race.  There is the mysterious race of alien marauders who have victimized the kones in the past and prove to be a definite obstacle to the expansion of the human race.  And, finally, there are the hideous inhabitants of an alternate colony site on a nightmarish world that becomes the site of a harrowing rescue mission.  Geir writes a crackling tale on a wide canvas, successfully keeping many narrative balls in the air.  Sadly, this series is out of print (I've found it only in used book stores).  There is only one more published book in the series, but it is my impression that it does not provide closure because of the early cancellation of the series, probably due to poor sales.  Volume III, \\"First Victory,\\" sits on my shelf, and one day I shall read it and no doubt be disappointed that the saga will never be concluded.	2005-09-03
US	49738138	R11ZMIR6QBRCG4	0892960639	252825277	Levine	Books	3	6	7	N	N	A frightened detective	In the late 50s and early 60s, author Donald E. Westlake, then just getting started, sold four short stories about a mild-mannered police detective named Abe Levine to Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine.  Levine's unique angle was that he was acutely aware of his mortality; he's in the habit of compulsively monitoring his own heartbeat and believes himself to be in danger of a heart attack.  His fear of death manifests itself as a deep, pitiless rage against those who take the lives of others, and his adventures typically conclude with him expressing this anger, perhaps in an unexpected comment or, in one particularly dark episode, by driving a criminal to suicide.  This volume collects all of the Levine stories, including one that Hitchcock wouldn't publish because it didn't really qualify as a mystery and another written especially for this volume.  The last two stories are the best, but even when the story itself is weak, Levine's unique take on life maintains a certain level of interest.	2005-08-06

It comes as no surprise that there is a double-cross, and Lestat is trapped in the body of a human.  He enlists the aid of his friend David Talbot, an elite member of the Talamasca, a secret organization that studies supernatural phenomena.  Together, they must find a way to unseat the wizard from Lestat's super powerful body and restore the vampire to his rightful shell.    Like the previous book in the series, \\"Queen of the Damned,\\" this one takes a while to get going.  In fact, a full 200 pages pass before reflection and philosophy finally recede a bit and a plot begins to assert itself.  Once it does, though, the book really takes off and turns out to be a terrific read with a surprising ending.  I wish Anne Rice would get better at integrating her themes and her plots so that we could be spared these long, meandering prologues (however insightful they may be) before the action starts.	2005-07-31

Not unexpected, given the legendary status of Frank Herbert's original series.  It's been a good 15 years since I read the originals, and I intend to read them again after working my way through the prequels.  What to make of this effort by Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson?  They've definitely decided to go the route of space opera in this story of the great conflict between humans and thinking machines that would result in the taboo against artificial intelligence that the elder Herbert alludes to in the original books.  The great care taken by him in developing coherent systems of philosophy and ecology is not evident here, which undoubtedly contributes to much of the disillusionment.  Frankly though, I felt that the original series sometimes got too bogged down in such abstract and esoteric matters, particularly in the later books.  (Maybe I'll feel different when I reread them; my attention span was shorter 15 years ago.)  I just went with the story that Herbert and Anderson had to tell and enjoyed it for what it was--a crackling tale of heroes and villains that offers insight into the origins of many elements of the Dune universe.	2005-07-05

In the final novel of Edgar Rice Burroughs's Venus series, stalwart Earthman Carson Napier and his mate, the beautiful Duare, are trying to find their way back to Korva, the country that became their home in the previous book.  We follow them from mishap to mishap as they encounter a nation of fishmen, the cult of a strange goddess, a macabre museum whose living exhibits are paralyzed then mounted, and a war between navies of huge land-bound ships on a great plain.  The story is episodic, reflecting its genesis as a quartet of pulp magazine stories, but lots of fun if you like this sort of thing.

Since Lovecraft himself is such a titanic figure in American horror, his critical opinions on the genre are naturally of interest to anyone attracted to the topic.

This is the only novel of Brunner's that I've read, but I have to assume that he improved considerably later since he produced two very highly regarded novels, \\"The Sheep Look Up\\" and \\"Stand on Zanzibar.\\"  This book is a bit of fluff that displays all of the worst traits of Golden Age science fiction--a nave faith in the ability of extraordinary individuals (invariably scientists) to engineer the optimum human destiny, and a maddening tendency toward endless exposition delivered through interminable conversations.  The hero, Counce, subjects people to horrendous fates, including starvation and torture, all in the name of a greater good--and they love him for it later.  I don't think this novel has ever been reprinted (I came across it in a used book store), and I can understand why.	2005-05-20

The most interesting aspect of this novel is the way it tracks the local mood through the initial excitement at the attention and attendant business opportunities that the mysterious killings provide to the eventual horror that comes with the dawning realization that there might really be a monster out there.  Overall however, author John Lutz has produced a pretty low-key thriller that lacks much in the way of genuine suspense and has a real let-down of an ending.  I don't want to give anything away, but...  (...) There's also a subplot involving a local bigshot who seems to be scheming something big that never pays off.  \\"Bonegrinder\\" lurked in a box of unread paperbacks for more than twenty years before rising to waste several hours of my reading life.

There is a play within a play--a marvelous send-up of drawing room mysteries--and a couple of drama critics who comment on the stage action in rather oblique ways that often make it seem that they may actually be speaking of their relations with the actors playing the characters.  Then they enter the action of the play and everyone seems compelled to remain in character.  I suppose one could read a lot into this, such as the nature of the roles we play in society or the degree to which the reality we experience is deterministic or preordained, but frankly I just enjoyed the humor.  It's too clever by half to be a meaningful statement about the human condition, but just witty enough to be a terrific comedy.	2005-04-27

His nuanced and detailed examinations of motive and emotion speak to us across years and cultural barriers because of the universality of his themes.  The prospect of reading a novella that tracks in great detail the preoccupations of a rather ordinary man as he sickens and dies may not seem very enticing, but Tolstoy delivers such truth and understanding that the result is fascinating and moving.  Here, the focus is on Ivan Ilyich, a government functionary who enjoys some professional success before succumbing as the result of a meaningless, seemingly trivial, accident.  As death grows near, he is forced to reexamine his belief that he has lived a good life simply because it conformed to the expectations of proper society.  As such, it also serves as an eloquent defense of the author's own decision in his real life to renounce the privileges of his birth to live the simple life of a peasant.	2005-04-16

Peter Straub develops a compelling mystery with interesting characters and then fails to make it pay off in the end.  Tom's near death experience turns out to have no bearing on later events and the resolution of the mystery is pretty much what you would expect; any time you have arrogant, powerful rich characters who treat the protagonist badly, you know that they must be up to their necks in some kind of dirty business.  I've read \\"Koko,\\" the first (and much superior) novel in the so-called Blue Rose trilogy and I fail to see any connection between them, other than the fact that Tom reads a novel that was written by one of the characters from \\"Koko.\\"  This is not one of Straub's best.	2005-04-12

Michael Crichton has produced an exciting pastiche of historical narrative combining documents written by an actual Arab traveler with his own imaginative speculations on the origins of the epic poem Beowulf.  Disregard the reviewers who found this novel boring.  There are not very many conversations, so I suppose they were put off by having to read so many paragraphs of five lines or more.

Hell is depicted as the ultimate bureaucracy, staffed by tempters who are motivated by the fear of punishment.  Lewis frequently displays great insight when dissecting the less charitable elements of human nature.  However, he also comes across as disdainful, dismissive and condescending toward non-Christians.   <br /> <br />At times, he shows himself to be in possession of prejudices that, in my eyes at least, disqualify him from being the moral authority that many believe him to be.  The best example of this can be found in the epilogue, \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast,\\" in which Lewis laments the tendency of some to interpret the political ideal of \\"equality\\" as a moral justification for dragging everyone down to the same level of mediocrity.  He claims that the feeling that prompts someone to claim that they are just as good as anyone else is one of the root causes of sin and is really just \\"the itching, writhing, smarting awareness of an inferiority which the patient refuses to accept.\\"  Among the examples of inferiority that he provides are some really stunning cases, whether stunningly irrelevant and frivolous (such as the claim that toy dogs are inferior to Saint Bernards) or stunningly wrong-headed and shallow (such as the claim that plain women are inferior to beauties).   <br /> <br />Whatever you may think of his content, though, Lewis always makes his case clearly and, in this case, through the conception of a brilliant metaphor. <br />	2005-03-24

When author Fritz Leiber keeps his focus on that basic premise, detailing the effects of the Wanderer's appearance and mankind's efforts to cope with it, this novel really flies, particularly in an early sequence wherein an astronaut barely escapes the shattering of the Moon and finds himself in orbit around the new planet.  This is real action-packed sense-of-wonder science fiction from a grand master. <br /> <br />However, other factors act against the novel's success.  There are far too many characters and many of them are handled in such sketchy fashion that not even Leiber seems interested in them.  For example, the high jacking of an ocean-liner, which could have generated some genuine excitement, is instead summarized in flat declarative sentences in a couple of paragraphs.  In addition, I don't want to give away the ultimate nature and purpose of the Wanderer, so suffice it to say that by the time one of our heroes became involved in a love affair with a green-furred cat woman from outer space, certain plot elements had turned decisively away from the hard-SF depiction of global tragedy that I had begun to enjoy.  Finally, the dialogue and relationships among the characters has become terribly dated.  I know that it's not fair to expect an author to anticipate what will make his story seem stale forty years later; nevertheless, it does remain a distraction and an obstacle to complete enjoyment. <br />	2005-03-05

Each of them is caught in a domestic trap that makes them vulnerable to desperate schemes born of hopelessness.  Masako is a strong, capable woman who lives in a sterile, loveless household.  Beautiful Yayoi has two children and is saddled with a philandering gambler for a husband.  Skipper is a widow who barely ekes out a living caring for her mother-in-law, a teenage daughter, and a grandson.  Kuniko is a vain, despicable woman, self-centered and deep in debt.  One of the many pleasures of this suspenseful novel is watching how the consequences of their actions radiate, like ripples from a stone dropped into still water, until they awaken the long-repressed sadistic passions of a disturbed killer.    Perhaps Kirino could be faulted for telegraphing some of her plot developments earlier than necessary, but this remains an exceedingly powerful suspense novel.  I was drawn into the lives of these women and was sorry when the story came to an end.  An added bonus is the glimpse it provides of Japan's dark side, a much needed humanizing touch for Americans who still hold a stereotypical view of Japan as a society of polite human worker bees.  I hope more of Kirino's novels will be translated into English in the near future.	2005-02-25

This leads one of the most famous partnerships in literature into a strange case involving treasure, murder, and betrayal.  As he did in the previous novel of the series, Arthur Conan Doyle tells two stories.  One is the tale of Holmes, Watson, and the unraveling of the case.  The other is the flashback to the story of the main villain, an adventure tale involving a native mutiny against colonial masters.  As a product of his time, Doyle cannot, I suppose, help being sympathetic to the colonialists and there is an undercurrent of racism that can be troubling to modern eyes.  However, it is encouraging to note that not a single racist sentiment (that I can recall) is attributed to either Holmes or Watson.  This is a fine mystery that benefits from the strong evocation of fog-bound Victorian London.	2005-02-05

The American gangster in question often disappears from the narrative for long stretches while Whiting explains the long history of collusion between Japanese politicians and the yakuza.  Nevertheless, the result is a fascinating social history with plenty of entertaining anecdotes and colorful character profiles.  Chief among the latter are Nick Zapetti himself, the \\"gangster\\" who made a fortune with pizza parlors that became the hangout of choice for expatriates, entertainers, and, most significantly, those who make their living on the wrong side of the law, and then lost that fortune through a combination of stubbornness, bad luck, and ignorance.  Another highlight is the career of Rikidozan, the former sumo wrestler who became a national hero and single-handedly established professional wrestling in Japan by defeating foreign wrestlers in scripted bouts, all the while hiding his Korean heritage.  Often very funny, this book appeals to both a taste for the prurient and seamy and the desire for a serious, even-handed analysis of the role of organized crime, political selfishness, and short-sighted anti-Communism in Japan's rise to power and wealth.	2005-01-20

CS Lewis's excellent fantasy is a retelling of the Christian story, featuring a powerful lion named Aslan as a stand-in for Jesus Christ.  Whether you are a member of the faith or just want to read a great fantasy, this is an ideal book.  Written more than 50 years ago, it is brief, efficient, and provides closure, unlike modern fantasies (many of them very fine, I admit) that go on for 900+ pages spread out over three or more volumes.  Lewis's writing style is reminiscent of \\"Mere Christianity,\\" chatty and fatherly with occasional little digressions (such as pointing out that the housekeepers will not figure much in the story) that add charm to the narrative.	2005-01-16

Q and the crews of the starship Enterprise from three parallel universes find themselves right in the thick of the action. <br /> <br />Three things seem apparent about this novel.  First, author Peter David had fun writing it.  It's clever, if a bit too convoluted at times, and has fun making unexpected connections and arcane references to Trek history.  He has a firm grip of the characters and writes their dialogue and interactions well.  Second, he wrote it fast, much too fast.  The prose is very sloppy, becoming at times unreadable.  Third, this book is much too long.  Most, if not all, of the sequences written from the perspectives of Q and Trelane should have been cut out.  That would have improved the novel a great deal, because those scenes are truly awful.   <br /> <br />Here's the problem: how can anyone, much less a guy dashing off a Star Trek novel, convincingly inhabit the perspective of an omnipotent, omniscient being?  A masterful novelist might pull it off with great thought and effort, but Peter David isn't up to the task.  That's not a knock against him, since almost nobody is up to that task, but he should have realized his limitations.  He gives us beings who, rather than existing on a plane beyond our understanding, have mothers and fathers just like we do, act from very human motivations, and even derive their names from Latin root words!  The TV series managed (just barely at times) to present the character successfully because it was always made clear that the version of Q and his universe that we saw was dumbed down to make human comprehension possible.  David mistakes the dumbed down version for the real, unvarnished thing. <br />	2005-01-15

The early part of the book is the least interesting.  Wilde was one of the first useless celebrities-figures who gain notoriety simply because something odd or appealing about them keeps them in the public eye apart from any actual talent (although Wilde was, by all accounts, an excellent speaker).  Ellman's analysis of Wilde's aestheticism is, I suppose, essential to a complete understanding of the man, but since the matters that Wilde devoted so much of his energy to were so frivolous and trivial, it doesn't make for a very good read.  Later, though, Wilde demonstrates his talent with the publication of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" and his successful plays, and the biography picks up as well.  Wilde becomes a truly tragic figure by the end, ruined by his love for Lord Alfred Douglas, hounded by Douglas's father the Marquis of Queensberry, imprisoned, and finally betrayed and forgotten by most of his former friends.  For all his wit and insight, Wilde emerges as a curiously nave character and basically a good man, kind and trusting to a fault.	2005-01-09

This novel is slow to get started, with too many characters and an unfocused narrative.  It probably could have been shortened by about a hundred pages.  After the rocky first section, though, the story takes form and things really pick up.  There are three major threads to the plot.  Akasha and Lestat travel the world, putting her terrifying plan into motion.  Meanwhile, a group of vampires await her arrival in a remote mountain retreat, speculating on her motives and wondering whether they will ultimately be spared.

This desperate adventure coincides with the prophesied Time of Changes, a suitably cataclysmic event that answers most of the questions raised in the series and leaves a pleasant sense of ambiguity surrounding some. <br /> <br />I do not share many of the misgivings voiced by others about this series.  I felt that David Brin wrapped up his various plot threads in a fulfilling manner and provided a satisfying answer to the great mystery that drove this ambitious saga.

This fuller, more three-dimensional portrayal of Lestat seems revisionist and at odds with many aspects of his character as revealed in the previous novel.  For example, I don't recall the Lestat of \\"Interview\\" being so preoccupied with goodness.  Nevertheless, it is fascinating story, even though it ends on an inconclusive, unsatisfying note.

As the double-crossed assassin hunts down his former employers, a policeman and his fiancee find themselves on opposite sides of the fray.  Graham Greene's writing style is very cinematic here; many passages played out effortlessly in my mind's eye like scenes from a vintage film noir.  It almost makes me think that it may have easy for Carol Reed to direct the classic \\"The Third Man\\" (also based on a Greene story).  Greene is not satisfied with simply providing an involving plot; he gives his characters depth and dimension and interesting dialogue as well.  Recommended.	2004-09-26

Gilmore was the first person to be executed in the United States after the reinstatement of the death penalty in the 1970s.  Norman Mailer immerses us deeply in Gilmore and his world.  The first part of the book covers his time outside prison on parole, his intense affair with Nicole Baker, and his inability to cope responsibly with freedom, culminating in the motiveless killings that put him back in prison.  The second half covers Gilmore's time in prison, his battle to be executed, and the media frenzy that surrounded it.  Mailer introduces us to scores of individuals who played parts both large and small in Gilmore's life, demonstrating that everyone has an interesting story if you look closely enough.  This is an uncommonly rich and textured work that rewards the perseverance required to finish it.  Unlike many other reviewers, I did not find the detail to be extraneous nor Mailer's writing style to be overblown or arrogant.  Rather, I was impressed at how restrained and objective it was.	2004-08-15

Every one of Krug's actions appears to be motivated by the need for self-aggrandizement, although he would probably be shocked to hear it; this blindness is a fascinating aspect of the character.  Krug wants to stretch his presence across this universe, so he is building a mile-high glass tower on the northern tundra that will house a tachyon projector.  He needs workers for his project, so he creates androids that are capable of the full range of human emotion and presses them into service.  Some reviewers have complained that the story ends on an inconclusive note but, if you read this story, just think about the havoc that Krug has caused through his single-minded attachment to his own grand schemes without adequate thought to their consequences.  Robert Silverberg has penned a worthy cautionary tale about the danger of pairing too much power with too much ambition and too little ability or desire to imagine any result but what the great man intends.	2004-08-03

I basically agree with him, but the first two sections of this book read like the ramblings of a grouchy old man, albeit a very well-educated one.  It comes alive in the final section, in which Hughes laments that Americans have come to see art as something therapeutic, that the intention to heal or offer solace has come to be of more value than the technical merits of the piece.  This section also includes a very interesting and entertaining account of the furor over the work of Robert Mappelthorpe.	2004-07-29

It came out of a box in my friend's garage, and I decided to read it because he remembered liking it so much. I liked it, too. Although it is rather conventional in its structure and some aspects of the plot were left underdeveloped, I thought that David Morrell had a good handle on the genre and wrote some interesting characters--all men who have endured personal and professional failures and retreated to a small town in Wyoming to live life on a smaller scale. Their self-esteem as well as their lives is put on the line with the appearance of a mysterious virus that changes whatever it infects into a savage, murderous animal. I wonder if the makers of the film &quot;28 Days&quot; were familiar with this book.	2004-07-24

They think they find such a place in the city of Sanara, which is under siege by the Zani. Complications arise as the traitorous ruler of Sanara sends Carson on a secret mission to the rival city of Amlot, supposedly on a vital mission but in reality to get him out of the way so that he can claim the lovely Duare.<br /><br /> Edgar Rice Burroughs satirizes the Nazis (rearrange the letters in 'Zani') in this story, which was published in the late 30s. The constant cries of &quot;Malthu Mephis!&quot; in praise of the cretinous leader of Amlot, the ridiculous salute which consists of standing on one's head until the great man passes, the fear of every citizen that they may be reported to the authorities by friends, family, or others all point to ERB's contempt of the German government of that time in probably his most political series. Of course, there is plenty of adventure and it benefits from being one of the least episodic of his stories. Unfortunately, it becomes a bit unfocused at the end. Naturally, the story ends with Carson and Duare separated once again, but there is only one book left in this series, so I'm sure they'll work things out soon.	2004-07-21

These diary entries form the meat of the book and many of them are real eye-openers.  I knew that there are many kids in our society living in situations that are really intolerable, but I was nevertheless shocked by many of the things I read.  In the end I was impressed by many of the students, saddened by others.<br />I would have liked to read a bit more from Gruwell herself.  Although she mentions what a struggle she had with her class at times, I got the sense from reading the entries that the students started making connections between their lives and their texts and producing well-written, introspective diary entries fairly quickly.  I have no doubt that Gruwell accomplished amazing things, but it sometimes comes across as too pat.  Surely there were some students she didn't reach.  Surely there were times when her approach failed and she had to go back and rethink her methods.  But then again, I suppose that's all material for a different book.  This one is reserved for the voices of the students.  It's a good read.	2004-07-12

Space-faring earthman Carson Napier was separated from his beloved princess Duare at the conclusion of the previous novel.  Now, he is after her once again, determined to get her home safely to her kingdom of Vepaja, and the result is the literary equivalent of one of the old Saturday morning serials with just a pinch of social commentary.  From the Room of the Seven Doors, down the River of Death to the City of the Dead, where a mad scientist presides over a kingdom of zombies, and the beautiful city of Havatoo, which is a paradise but only if your lineage is pure, Carson and Duare bounce from predicament to predicament.  Will they survive their adventures?  Will Duare drop her haughty facade and accept Carson's love?  Is there any doubt?  Not really, but getting there is the fun.  This series benefits by being more humorous than most of Burroughs' work.	2004-07-12

Delany introduces a fascinating and complex culture.  His large cast of characters is drawn from all levels of society, and he handles them very skillfully.  By the end of the book, though, it seems clear that this was never intended to be a self-contained story.  The questions that drive the narrative and motivate the characters are left unanswered, and events sort of peter out inconclusively.  Since this is the first part of a trilogy, it is reasonable to assume that these questions will be answered later.  At that time, I may revise my opinion of this book.  (...)	2004-06-23

Like every other conscious person in the western world, I have always been aware of Holmes' titanic status in our popular culture, but this is actually the first story about him that I've ever read.  It's very entertaining to follow as A. Conan Doyle introduces the various facets of the Holmes legend: we meet Gregson and Lestrade, watch Holmes and Watson take up lodgings at 221B Baker Street, and are introduced to Holmes' violin playing, pipe smoking, snuff addiction, and, of course, his incredible powers of deduction, which are a marvel to all that surround him.  Watson's musings on Holmes' nature are often quite humorous as he attempts to figure out this eccentric individual.<br />The mystery itself is quite good.  Many have remarked on how the story derails with its lengthy digression to the back-story of the murder, which occurred in Utah.  This part of the story is sure to offend Mormons, who are here portrayed as a cultish fascist state that will resort to officially sanctioned murder to accomplish its ends.  Doyle appears to have been reflecting the prejudice of his time, and this is a very unfortunate and disappointing aspect of the novel.  However, if you can look past that, perhaps by imagining that they are some fictional cult, this section of the book is quite effective and suspenseful in its own way.  However, the major strength of the story is, of course, Holmes himself.  I think that Doyle quickly realized this and focused on Holmes much more closely in later stories.	2004-06-08

She informs us of her fragile mental state in the very first essay, in which she describes a pervasive sense of detachment that she felt from the world.  She then goes on to deliver a collection of well-written profiles on personalities, places, and the concerns of the time (late 60s-early 70s).  Didion inserts herself and her personal issues into these pieces on ocassion, which no doubt contributes to the accusation by some that she is a whiner.  On the contrary, I feel that it was courageous for Didion to reveal herself this way and that the awareness of the narrator as a fragile, flawed individual rather than an omnipotent, god-like commentator pronouncing judgement on its subjects gives a unity and a perspective to these disparate pieces that they would not have possessed otherwise.	2004-05-23

I was somewhat underwhelmed by this family classic.  Stuart's \\"adventures,\\" such as riding on a toy boat and going down a drain, are related briefly and dully, without developing much tension or excitement.  The characters are unfailingly stiff and polite with each other; even the interaction between family members often comes off like conversations between strangers at a cocktail party.  The Little family's treatment of Stuart seems quite neglectful as well.  Mr. Little, in particular, seems to think nothing of sending his little son into potentially dangerous situations, such as down a drainpipe to fetch a ring.  At one point, the book describes how it becomes Stuart's job to go inside the piano while it is being played and hold on to a key that sticks, even though doing so subjects him to loud noises that affect his hearing for hours afterward.	2004-05-15

There is much discussion of a powerful new doomsday weapon and many vignettes featuring characters that we have never seen before, do not see again (at least not in this book), and which amount to nothing at all.  The ridiculous ending reveals that this is the first installment of a continuing story, but author Diane Duane has not even provided a provocative cliff-hanger to interest us in reading the next installment.  Rest assured, if I ever decide to read any further (doubtful), it will be a used edition so that the publisher doesn't see any profit from this sorry excuse for a book.	2004-04-09

This is a light, breezy story whose main charm is its amusing lead character, who narrates the story and her many screw-ups on the way to ultimate victory in a very humorous voice.

The identity and nature of Koko is inextricably bound up with a horrible experience that they all share--the massacre of children in a Vietnamese village.    This is a long novel.  Straub paints fully realized characters with complicated and believable motivations.  At times, the horror aspects of the novel take a back seat to the more straightforward human drama in his characters' lives, but I, for one, did not mind this because the drama was so compelling.  In fact, I was a bit let down by the novel's resolution, having enjoyed the details of the search and the interplay between characters so much.  I had come to care more about what was going to happen to Michael Poole, Connor Linklater, Tim Underhill, Maggie Lah, and even the pathetic Harry Beavers than about the identity and fate of Koko.

Like the rest of the series, it is audacious, often fascinating, but also very problematic.  \\"Labyrinth\\" is often long-winded and unwieldy, particularly in the beginning.  But everything comes together as the rival riverboats commanded by archenemies Sam Clemens and John Lackland meet for their final confrontation, after which the survivors struggle on to gain entrance to the mysterious tower in the North Sea.  The battle and the final leg of the journey are well-written and full of adventure and mystery.  However, once they gain entrance to the tower, the story becomes dull and stagnant.  The nature of the Ethicals, their struggle, and the truth about the human soul are presented in a series of interminable conversations.  It is very unsatisfying, after having made the commitment to reading over a thousand pages of this series, to have it resolved with the introduction of a character who simply explains away all of the mysteries.  Also, by the time the series ends, Farmer has killed off the majority of his most interesting characters, often in rather off-handed ways that are at odds with all the attention, detail, and craft that went into developing them in the first place.  Of the final band that reaches the tower, most are relatively minor characters that I really didn't care about and whose personalities had not been well-developed.<br />In my opinion, the Riverworld series has turned out to be quite a disappointment.  It does not live up to the high reputation that it has garnered within the SF community.	2004-03-13

He has been suffering amnesia on our world but recovers his memory and, in uneasy partnership with some of his siblings and outright conflict with others, attempts to wrest Amber from his brother Eric, who has assumed the throne.    The main drawback of this imaginative novel is its brevity.  Roger Zelazny's story is epic in scope but he relates it in less than two hundred pages, making for a narrative that is extremely sketchy at times, reading more like a synopsis than a finished novel.  At one point, Corwin and his brother Bleys travel to a Shadow world, insinuate themselves into the local culture, become worshipped as gods, and forge an army ready to march on Amber and fight with the zeal of Crusaders in a holy war--all in the space of two or three sentences!  In addition, I was never quite clear on the nature of Amber and its powerful ruling family.  What does it mean for one world to be a \\"shadow\\" of another?  The brothers seem godlike at times with their abilities to manipulate the environment of shadow worlds through willpower alone and affect change in Amber itself by pronouncing curses.  What does this say about the nature of reality?  Ultimately, my opinion of Zelazny's series will depend on how well he addresses these concerns.  I am sufficiently intrigued that I look forward to reading more.	2004-02-15

Although this essential quest and the puzzle at the heart of the series still interests, this sprawling, messy novel often tested my patience.  Burton and his crew make an appearance at the beginning, but then disappear from the novel altogether.  There are numerous unnecessary digressions, including several dull chapters of backstory on Farmer's alterego, the science-fiction writer Peter Jairus Frigate (check out the initials), who is actually a relatively minor character.  <br />When Farmer is developing the quest for the truth and the rivalries between characters, the book is fun.  However, it really needed quite a bit of editing to whittle out the extraneous material and some shockingly bad writing.

Guided by a rebel from among the ranks of those who created the place, Sam Clemens and his friends build a riverboat like the ones from Clemens' Mississippi days to search out the headwaters of the river and the mysterious castle which is rumored to exist there.  In the process, they build a nation and become involved in war and intrigue with their neighbors.<br />I was enjoying this novel.  The prose is unexceptional, but efficient and workmanlike, and Farmer tells a decent story in an interesting setting.  Then Farmer introduces the neighboring state of Soul City and its leader, Elwood Hacking, and derails the whole thing.  Hacking is a former slave who is founding an all-black state where \\"soul brothers and soul sisters can loaf and invite their souls.\\"  He is irrational and reactionary.  One of his final acts is to rape a white woman and a passage describing them glimpsed in a window together contrasts the woman's \\"long honey-colored hair and very white skin\\" with \\"the bushy hair and black face of Elwood Hacking\\" in a very distasteful way.  Given his fair treatment of other black characters such as Hugo Firebrass and Jill Gulbirra (from the next book in the series), I am not convinced that Farmer is an unqualified racist, but I was puzzled and disquieted by this aspect of the novel.	2004-01-24

We are reintroduced to the crew of Streaker, who plot their escape from under the nose of their fearsome adversaries.<br />This novel suffers from the same problem as most middle works in a trilogy: having neither a true beginning nor a true ending, it exists as nothing but middle that goes on and on, often seeming quite meandering.  Only when the final novel has been read is it possible to judge just how essential are the plot elements included here.  That said, this series remains immensely enjoyable.  It is always fun to see a talented author create a richly detailed world and then turn it upside down, letting the chips fall where they may.  The story takes a while to get going, as Brin spends about the first seventy pages having characters do little more than contemplate the events of the first novel.  I benefited from this since it had been quite a while since I had read the previous installment, but it seems like that could have been tightened up a bit.<br />I look forward to reading the next book and hope that Brin chooses to revisit this universe some day.

Perhaps it should have been organized into three parts.  Parts 1 and 2 are very anecdotal as author Patrick Tierney gives a first-person account of his adventures in the Andes as he investigated his subject.  Part 1 is as much about mountain climbing as human sacrifice.  He scaled various peaks to investigate mountain burial sites of Incan child sacrifices.  In Part 2, he spends time in the company of modern-day shamans to uncover the truth behind present-day sacrifices, culminating in a lengthy interview with Maximo Coa, a man who is famed for committing many human sacrifices.  Part 3 shifts gears completely.  Referring to the patterns and motifs of human sacrifice and the mythology surrounding it, he makes a provocative and fascinating case that sacrifices were an integral part of early, developing Christianity and that sublimation of and guilt over this fact has resulted in hundreds of years of anti-Semitism.	2004-01-09

It is divided into three sections; tales of the rabbit folk-hero El Ahrairah, other rabbit folktales, and the story of what happened to Hazel and crew after the first novel.  The folktales have a certain charm, but the part I was really looking forward to, the continuing adventures of the Watership rabbits, was distinctly underwhelming.  It is prosaic and disjointed, full of small comings and goings that don't really amount to much.  The mysticism in these stories is far more pronounced but to no clear purpose.  If Adams is going to return to this wonderful world he created so many years after the original was published, he really should have more of a story to tell.	2003-11-30

Ma Rainey's back-up band awaits the overdue arrival of the so-called Queen of Blues, discussing their lives and arguing about the music scene and their places in it.  The white studio execs are practically tearing their hair out over Ma's tardiness and the demands that she is sure to make when she arrives.  When she finally comes, she is every bit as demanding and overbearing as we expect, but also very perceptive-she is well aware that black artists are being exploited by the very record company people who continually urge her to be \\"reasonable\\" about the amount of money that she \\"wastes\\" on personal demands while recording the music that makes them so rich.<br />Although it features very good dialogue and some fine monologues, nothing much happens dramatically during the course of the play.  There is an explosive finale, but it feels contrived and overdone, as though Wilson didn't know where to take his characters after all of the talking stopped.	2003-11-10
US	49738138	R1MOBWWL5LTWVZ	0446518549	614982455	Encounter With Tiber	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Quite good	This ambitious novel weaves five narratives together to tell the epic story of mankind's encounter with the alien Tiberians.  The Tiberians came to our solar system thousands of years ago but left behind only mysterious artifacts, most notably advanced information storage devices known as Encyclopedias.  The story of the Tiberians's adventures on our world is framed by the tale of the humans's multi-generational effort to retrieve an Encyclopedia and use the data therein to seek out the homeworld of the Tiberians.<br />Buzz Aldrin's contribution is evident here.  Although perhaps too detailed at times, the description of the politics and hardware involved in man's conquest of space is fascinating.  A flaw of the novel becomes evident in the lengthy Tiberian mid-section, which probably came predominantly from co-author Steven Barnes.  The aliens are far too human in their psychology-so much so that it is easy to forget that they are aliens at all.  The novel ends beautifully on just the right note of mystery and romance as humankind, now fully matured as a star-faring race, seeks the elusive descendants of their ancient alien predecessors.	2003-11-09

It presents the climax of Bram Stoker's overrated novel from Mina Harker's point of view and shows us what happened to her and the other characters afterward.  It turns out that, with the blood of Dracula flowing in her veins, Mina has far more sympathy for the Count and his minions than was hinted at in Stoker's novel.  Furthermore, all is not quiet at Castle Dracula despite the destruction of the famous vampire...<br />Stoker's original novel was overlong and frequently dull.  The characters were one-dimensional stalwart men and fainting damsels.  Author Ellen Bergstrom has filled out these characters and added a feminist perspective, not to mention a healthy dose of sex.  Purists may shudder at her approach, but I found it to be an interesting take on a novel that really doesn't deserve to be treated as sacrosanct and untouchable.	2003-11-08

This slim volume is both compulsively readable and dense with thought-provoking elements.  I did not expect the visceral, brutal quality of the more nightmarish sequences to be rendered so graphically and effectively in a 19th century novel.  Small wonder that it caused controversy when it was published.  But the novel offers more than just brilliant horror.  Wells's story is also a parable on what it is to be human and the role of religion in a society.  Excellent.	2003-10-04

Eventually, he proves himself to be invaluable to the survival of his adopted home.<br />This is a very clunky novel.  It is poorly written, with uninteresting characters and dull plotting.  There are far too many lengthy conversations and dull exposition-Blish tells when he ought to be showing.  Like many older science fiction novels, it displays a naïve infatuation with technology that has not aged well-for example, a city that is governed by infallible computers is held to be superior to one that is controlled by mere men.  Blish fails to develop adequately his intellectual theme-that a knowledge of history and its lessons is an invaluable guide to coping with the future-and the moments of high adventure are presented in stiff, workmanlike fashion.  Not recommended.	2003-09-27

This book is a &quot;biography&quot; which supposes that the Tarzan novels tell the story of a real figure, albeit much fictionalized to protect his true identity.  Farmer seperates the &quot;fact&quot; from the fiction and also traces the jungle lord's kinship with such other notable figures as Sherlock Holmes, Doc Savage, the Shadow, and the Scarlet Pimpernel.

They try to befriend her and discover the truth about her.  Scott Ciencin knows how to write the characters and has a good grasp of the show's vernacular, but he is less successful at crafting a compelling story.  Most annoying, he gives Arianna an ability that would allow her to easily resolve the tension and uncertainty that torments her, yet provides an excuse for not exercising it that is very flimsy and contrived.  The humor leans toward the cute and lacks the bite that characterizes the best writing of the series.  If this is the type of story that had appeared on air, Buffy would not have lasted seven seasons.	2003-09-01

Wells does an exceptional job of extrapolation on the science of his day.  The lunar ecology is fascinating and poetic: each sundown all the plant life dies and the air falls to the ground like snow.  Wells betrays his interest in class once again: the Selenites have a society based on that of social insects, with each member possessing specializations necessary to its function, an idea that was no doubt fresher then than it is now.<br />The first part of this novel is a rousing adventure, as Wells makes imaginative use of the fact that the Earthlings are virtual supermen in the 1/6 gravity of the Moon.  No doubt this novel was greatly influential to later adventure writers such as Edgar Rice Burroughs.  The second part is more thoughtful and subtle, yet perhaps more horrifying, as a man alone among the Selenites strives to prevent their leader from deducing the greedy and expansionist nature of mankind for fear of his life.	2003-08-24

Unfortunately, it also promises ultimate destruction.  Only a few scientists are capable of seeing beyond their own self-interest and hubris to recognize this fact, but can they make others believe?  Asimov has constructed an admirable allegory for the environment quandry that we face here on earth, although he fails to show how limitless power would transform our lives.<br />The novel is constructed in three parts.  The first and third sections involve human beings and rely too much on telling and not enough on showing--lots of long, didactic conversations and far too little incident.  The third section is particularly weak; it is dull and bloodless with a take on human sexuality which is supposed to be advanced but, from today's standpoint, seems firmly mired in a seventies mentality. <br />The triumph of this novel is the masterful middle section.  Asimov depicts an alien society that is truly unlike mankind, yet he manages to depict distinct individuals.  This is quite surprising coming from a writer who is known neither for characterization or alien-building.  It's just a shame that the rest of the novel could not maintain this quality and had to end on such a tragically dull note.	2003-08-23

Therefore, Hogwarts is secured and Harry is watched closely.  Of course, Sirius Black does come, but not for the reasons that everyone expects...<br />This is the best of the first three Potter books.  It is darker and more complex than the previous books, with plenty of mystery and a number of surprising revelations along the way.  Azkaban and the Dementors that guard it are truly hideous creations, giving this book much more of a horror angle than the first two.  The focus of the book remains the tight friendship among Harry, Hermione, and Ron.	2003-08-10

As such, I suppose I am the ideal audience for this book, since CS Lewis undertakes to explain the fundamental unifying beliefs of the various Christian denominations in simple language and analogy that should be clear to anyone.  In this, he succeeds admirably, although his tone often comes off as condescending.  In the end, however, I was not persuaded.  I am put off by his views on homosexuals and the role of women as well as his acceptance of the Christian's permission (if not obligation) to kill in cases such as war or criminal punishment.  <br />I was also not convinced by his basic premise that God must exist because humans everywhere share a basic moral sense.  It is easier for me to believe that we evolved certain behaviors because they allowed us to coexist relatively peacefully in communities; these behaviors had survival value for us because we are best able to thrive in communities.  Being the intellectually complex beings that we are, we have developed sets of religious belief to explain these behaviors and tendencies to ourselves.  <br />These problems notwithstanding, \\"Mere Christianity\\" is a readable and illuminating introduction to Christian thought and merits reading.	2003-08-02

Even now, many of these tales still retain the capacity to shock.  Like most anthologies, the quality of the content is uneven, but the overall result is elevated by Ellison's story introductions, the afterwords to each story by the writers themselves, and the general sense that one is reading a serious attempt to push the genre in a more significant direction.  Standouts include stories by Ellison himself, Fritz Leiber, David R. Bunch, Sonya Dorman, JG Ballard, and Norman Spinrad.  Interestingly, the only real stinkers in the book are produced by veteran writers: Theodore Sturgeon, Damon Knight, and Poul Anderson.	2003-06-29

Her poet's sensibility is certainly put to good use here.  She uses beautiful, evocative prose to consummate what is clearly a long-standing love affair with the five senses.  Although this book is well-reasoned and researched, including much fascinating information about how the senses operate, this is not really a rigorously scientific book.  Rather, it is a collection of essays that often have little apparent connection to each other apart from the particular sense under discussion.  One moment we might be reading about the latest (at the time of publication) scientific findings about our sense of smell; on the next page we may encounter profiles of people who work as professional smellers for the perfume industry; from there we might move to Ackerman's own garden or a memory of time spent in a eucalyptus grove.  The result is an interesting, highly idiosyncratic journey through our senses and what they mean to us.	2003-06-14

This is one of the most significant novels ever written in the mystery genre.  Protagonist Spade is the epitome of the hard-boiled private dick, and author Dashiell Hammett's lean, economical style has influenced many of the writers who followed him.  For me, the main attractions of this novel did not include the resolution of the mystery.  I didn't really care about what happened to the black bird.  I enjoyed Hammett's style, the sharp dialogue, and the intricate double-crosses that the various characters pull on each other with varying levels of success.  The lengthy scene near the end of the story wherein Spade has all the principle characters together in one room and tries to hammer out an agreement that will allow most of them to get what they want while satisfying the police's need for a fall guy as well is a real highlight.  This novel is cheerfully amoral and very entertaining.	2003-06-12

The evil genius Achilles, Bean's old enemy, kidnaps Petra and others in order to further his own plans for world domination; Bean must join forces with Ender's brother Peter to thwart him.  Thus begins a novel of political intrigue and manuevering that at times reads too much like the narration for a game of Risk.  Author Orson Scott Card has fashioned a good story, but dilutes its effectiveness with too much conversation and polemic.  He passes up most opportunities to inject some action into the events.  Characters die and nations go to war, but for the most part Card tells us these things through the dialogue of characters who are not present rather than putting us right there at the scene and showing us.

In 1986, every potential liaison is conducted in the shadow of death as BJ attends the deaths of friends, participates in AIDS marches, and struggles to retain hope in the future.  As grim as the subject matter becomes, author David Feinberg never loses his sense of humor.

Back in Evan's hometown, something similar seems to have happened to Evan's uncle.  All of this is presented effectively, which is what makes the conclusion such a disappointment.  All of the various plot threads come together, but it all feels very arbitrary and sketchy.  The final explanation for the supernatural goings-on is vague.

When he comes into possession of a secret list of Greek patriots who are pretending to be collaborators, he must go on the run to escape the enemy forces that have been assigned to retrieve the information.  This is the only book by Leon Uris that I have read.  I was under the impression that he was a writer who researched his subjects meticulously.  Perhaps this was one of his first books, because there is very little local color here, nothing that one couldn't glean from watching movies and skimming a few travel books.  Worse than that, the characters and situations are clich from start to finish, and the prose is dull.  It reads like a treatment for a typical 50s WWII flick.	2003-05-04

Central themes include assimilation and the loss of traditional cultural values, troubled marraiges, and, of course, the shameful internment of Japanese Americans during WWII.  As a writer who was raised in the culture and who originally published many of these stories in Japanese American publications for a largely Japanese American audience, she produces uniquely authentic accounts of a lifestyle that has largely disappeared.  Here are the farms, the oil fields, the New Year's celebrations, the dusty internment camps, the tragic generation gaps, the hopes, dreams, and loneliness of a people who are inclined to remain quiet about personal matters--these stories present a fully developed portrait of the Japanese experience in American and its consequences.

This is a note that Vonnegut strikes often: a poor ineffectual fool passively accepts his fate in an absurd, random universe.  The more Vonnegut I read, the more tired I become of this tune, but I must admit that the author makes some interesting points along the way.<br />This time the fool is Rudy Waltz, who gained the nickname of Deadeye Dick when he fired a gun into the air, inadvertantly killing a pregnant woman a block away.  The story is fascinating and real when dealing with this tragic mistake and its consequences.  I couldn't help but feel some disappointment as the more absurd qualities of the story (ie, neutron bombs and radioactive mantlepieces) asserted themselves.  Vonnegut writes well about real people dealing with real problems.  I wish he would have restrained himself from introducing so many surreal elements; they smack of gimmickry and self-conscious symbolism.	2003-04-17

Nearly every character in this story is crazy, some because they have become unbalanced through their horrific battle experiences and others because they serve so well as functionaries in a system that has normalized the killing of other people.  Yossarian retains his  sanity through a tight focus on the necessity of his own survival.  He becomes a hero by ultimately refusing to capitulate to the forces that demand him to sublimate this most basic and healthy of natural urges to the convenience of a system of death based on the spurious logic of \\"Catch-22,\\" a series of mutually exclusive choices that make true choice impossible and lead one by default down the most destructive path.<br />This is a very funny book, although I felt that some of the more outlandish satire didn't sit well with the more graphically realistic elements of the novel.  The narrative is presented in a disjointed manner that heightens the chaos of the situation.  <BR>Some may be put off by the manner in which Heller attacks the mentality of war without any consideration for the specific conditions that may have provided some justification for the prosecution of WWII.	2003-03-30

She has constructed a narrative that is uncommonly perceptive and literate about both the subtle and quirky level of individual motivation and the larger forces of society which form the arena in which human lives play themselves out.  Middlemarch is a provincial English town during Victorian times and Eliot selects a broad range of characters from every level of society to illustrate her themes.  Prominent among these themes are the way in which the ambitions of potentially extraordinary achievers can be constrained by a poor choice of affiliation, most notably bad marraiges.  She also addresses the role of women, the way that wealthy landowners determine the quality of life for the poor, and presents insightful portraits of a number of personality types.  It is often a very funny book as well, as she exposes the foibles of the pompous and self-deluded with subtle and unerring accuracy.    This is not a light read.  This is a long, dense novel, but I found something fascinating on nearly every page.	2003-03-29

All goes well until their discovery by a starship crewed by humans with a mysterious purpose throws everything into chaos and uncertainty.<br />David Brin is telling a big story here.  The planet and the various alien cultures upon it are meticulously detailed and his concept of Uplift, whereby races achieve sentience and admittance to a heavily stratified galactic society through the patronage of more advanced races, remains one of the most brilliant concepts in science fiction.<br />However, be warned.  This is not a stand-alone book.  As Brin himself acknowledges in his afterword, his story just kept expanding in the telling until it could no longer be contained within a single volume.  This book does not even attempt to provide a temporary conclusion but rather leaves all of the various plot strands waving in thin air.  Therefore, I do recommend this book, but only if you are prepared to go on and read the next two in the trilogy as well.	2003-03-22

A trio of vampires--Lestat, comfortable with his nature and capable of reveling in his power and cruelty; Louis, conflicted by his dark cravings but unable to resist them; and Claudia, tortured by being forever trapped in the body of a six-year-old girl--provide the prism through which we are introduced to a meticulously crafted vampire underworld that exists parallel to our own.  Those who are put off by the dark, mopey, tragically romantic, gothic cliche that the vampire has become should not be deterred from reading this book, even though it is responsible for launching that cliche.  Rice's prose is lovely and there is much interesting contemplation on the nature of evil and redemption.  Not to mention a great story as well.	2003-03-08

Some authors, such as Lester del Rey and Theodore Sturgeon, improved greatly later to judge from their sub-standard initial offerings.  AE Van Vogt's inexplicably beloved \\"Black Destroyer\\" is also anthologized here yet again.

Not a bad idea for a novel, but John Brunner fails to develop his theme adequately in this thin volume.  Brunner's forte is really more toward the societal aspects of speculative fiction rather than technological extrapolation, yet he depends too much on almost mystical computers and technobabble regarding &quot;transfinite numbers&quot; to achieve his effect.  The device of subtly different alternate universes could have been exploited in far more interesting ways.	2003-02-16

He does this by adopting a historical approach, following the evolution of man's understanding of the nature of motion from the speculations of early Greek philosophers such as Zeno and Aristotle through the work of ground-breaking physicists such as Einstein and Bohr up to the most current knowledge about the crucial importance of the observer in determining reality.

Author Robert L. Forward never lets us forget how wonderful and brilliant he thinks his hero is, which came off as more than a little self-congratulatory since I couldn't shake the feeling that he was meant to serve as an alter-ego for Forward himself.  There is much juvenile one-upmanship between Randy and his cartoonish arch-rival, Oscar, who is just as bad as Randy is good and whose dislike is never explained as anything more than jealousy (but then, who wouldn't be jealous of such a terrific guy as Randy).  I found the key plot device of the Silverhairs to be ludicrous and uninteresting.  The sole saving grace of this book is some fascinating business toward the end concerning time travel and the interaction between the Randys of various time periods.  Had this aspect of the story been more prominent, it would have been a better book, but instead it is buried among juvenile characterizations and dull plotting.	2003-01-19

Although there is a great deal of information about King's life both public and private, other key players in this great drama also receive extensive treatment.  Some, such as John & Robert Kennedy and J. Edgar Hoover, are well-known.  Others have received far less recognition: Vernon Johns, the powerful itinerant country preacher who was a kind of grandfather to the movement; Bayard Rustin, whose unconventional lifestyle clashed with political reality in a way that caused much pain to King; Stanley Levison, one of King's closest confidante's and advisors, from whom King was pressured to distance himself because of alleged communist ties; Bob Moses, a tireless, courageous worker who toiled for years in the Deep South to register Negroes for the vote.<br />Branch also narrates events such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the Freedom Rides with the you-are-there immediacy of an eyewitness reporter and the eye for detail of a novelist.  This book is a very satisfying and informative read.	2003-01-08

He encounters a number of interesting and mysterious characters, including the Rose of the title, whose secret provides a pleasant surprise.  Martin Cruz Smith appears to have done his homework well; the evocation of the setting is well-done and there is a lot of fascinating information about mining in Victorian England.<br />Perhaps it is not fair to criticize one book by saying that it is not as good as another, but I was a bit disappointed because of the very high standard Smith set for himself with his series about Russian detective Arkady Renko.  &quot;Rose&quot; does not quite rise to that level.	2002-12-23

The first part of the story, in which English real estate agent Johnathan Harker is trapped inside Castle Dracula with the dread count, is riveting and so much better than I expected.  Stoker conjures up a truly oppresive and frightening atmosphere.<br />However, once the action shifts to England, the story bogs down and never really gets going again.  Stoker uses the unwieldy device of telling the entire story through the journal entries of various characters--they must have truly extraordinary memories to reproduce the conversations and lengthy speeches contained therein.  The characters themselves are paper thin; all of the men are brave and honorable and all of the women fair and pure.  Stoker devotes page after page to conversations in which characters deliver testimonials to each other's sterling qualities, which grows rather tiresome very quickly.  To make matters worse, Dracula fades into the background at this point and makes only a few appearances after that.<br />There are a few effective moments and things pick up a bit by the end of the novel, but it is never able to match the horror of its brilliant first section.	2002-12-08

The story revolves around three detectives whose lives, both professional and personal, are always teetering on the edge of collapse and the web of lies and concealment surrounding a sensational murder case in which each finds his own opportunity for a sort of redemption.

The world that author Robert Jordan has created for them to travel through is richly detailed, perhaps to a fault.  For all the book's great length, surprisingly little actually occurs over the course of the story as page after page are given over to explanations of the world's history and the details of daily life.  Still, I'm not complaining.  The stage he has set is worthy of a great epic; although all of the familiar trappings of heroic fantasy are present, rarely are they realized so fully.  The individual characters are well-drawn; their innocence, bewilderment, and growing fear as they realize the scope of the forces arrayed against them are excellently portrayed.  I also enjoyed the way that men and women each have their own kinds of magic.    One quibble: a story of this type really benefits from detailed maps of the world in which it takes place.  I found the map in this book too scanty and hope that this is rectified in later books of the series.	2002-10-13

Will, Beanpole, Henry and Fritz, the boys who have figured prominently in the previous two novels, are destined to have pivotal roles in this final struggle as well.  The strengths and weaknesses of the other books are evident here, too.  John Christopher has devised a great story with a satisfying ending, as our central characters rededicate themselves to the challenges confronting a post-Masters Earth.  However, Christopher's story is really too big for the minimalist style he has adopted.  Years pass in the course of a few pages and I was left with the feeling that I was being allowed only a glimpse of what could have been a richly detailed, fascinating world.  Of course, this book was written with young readers in mind, so brevity was a natural concern.  Christopher's Tripod books follow the primary adage of show business: always leave them wanting more.	2002-07-06

The working class has developed into the Morlocks, who have become physically repulsive creatures of the night yet retain some knowledge of technology.  The aristocrats have become the Eloi, attractive yet utterly useless, living like sheep.  Without the constraints of economics to protect the elite class, the Morlocks have begun to feed on them literally, just as the upper-class could have been said to feed on the workers figuratively during the Victorian Era.  Besides such social commentary, Wells also treats us to a haunting glimpse of the Earth at the end of time, where great crab-like creatures scuttle beside a drying sea under a dying sun.

Thus, JK Rowling begins an entertaining saga that has become a publishing phenomenon.  Like so many others, I have also been enthralled by Harry and his world.  I like the meticulous way that Rowling constructs a world that coexists with everyday reality, complete with its own sports, economy, and political organizations.  She peoples it with colorful, memorable characters, all of it anchored by the tight friendship between Harry, Ron, and Hermione.  I'm looking forward to seeing how Rowling develops her story over the next six books.	2002-05-21

These scattered, interrelated communities exist within two general, mutually antagonistic factions: the Shapers, who rely on genetic manipulation, and the Mechanists, who rely on advanced technology.  Bruce Sterling is an inventive writer with a lively intellect, but his novel often introduces such a barrage of names and factions that it was difficult for me to orient myself.  Furthermore, the action sometimes leaps years forward with scarcely any attention given to what happened in between.  Sterling's focus is more on developing his complex history than his characters and the novel suffers as a result.<br />Fortunately, this volume also contains Sterling's short fiction set within the same universe.  Every one of them is a gem--a rabbit punch to the mind with sharply drawn characterizations.  I would recommend reading the stories before the novel.  They supply an introduction to the Shaper/Mechanist universe and a  firm grounding in its realities that probably would have increased my appreciation of the novel.	2002-05-11

Soon, he is on the trail of a woman who may have committed murder to steal the identity of another.  This novel definitely benefits from its exotic setting.  Interesting facts and insights into Japanese society enliven a mystery that seems a bit plodding at times.  Although it drags in the middle, it really begins to pick up momentum again toward the end.  The finale reveals that this novel is not really about the mystery so much as it is about Inspector Honma and his drive to solve the puzzle.  Honma is a well-drawn character, but I would have been happier if the novel had provided more closure concerning the runaway fiancee.	2002-04-12

Together, they set off on a journey across the Atlantic Ocean.  I remember being enchanted by this story as a child.  Upon rereading it recently, however, it struck me as a somewhat cold exercise in storytelling for children.  The only character that really shows any personality is the nasty Centipede, and all of them seem to be rather class-conscious--even the saintly Ladybug, who looks down on ladybugs with two dots as being ill-mannered.  This is, however, still a book that I would read to my own children.  My changed opinion of it probably has more to do with the evolution of my tastes as a reader than it does with the merits of the book itself.	2002-03-25

There is a lot of action in this third novel of David Brin's Uplift series.  So far, each entry has been better than its predeccesor.

Two are successful, and they strive to learn as much as possible about the enemy so that they may report back to the last existing colony of free humans.  I preferred this novel to the previous one, \\"The White Mountains.\\"  Both novels share the same deficiency, a tendency to relate certain events too sketchily and a failure to develop key characters, in this case the German boy, Fritz.  However, the Masters themselves and Wil's adventures in their city are fascinating, and John Christopher's style does make for a fast-paced story.  My interest is piqued and I look forward to reading the final book in the trilogy.	2002-03-04

Vonnegut uses this spare plot as a point of departure for observations on numerous topics of interest.  Some literary gimmicks get in the way of the enjoyment: Vonnegut's habit of explaining commonplace things as though he were addressing an alien with no concept of Earthly existence, and the integration of drawings by the author into the text.  Both would have been more effective had they been used more sparingly.  Nevertheless, this book is often funny and sometimes profound.	2002-02-10

In order to justify their trip and make their return home possible, they must wait for the alien culture below to attain a certain level of technology.  There are interesting speculations about the nature of interstellar and planetary societies and imaginative extrapolations on technology.  There is also plenty of good old-fashioned scheming and political maneuvering among the humans.  It's much too long but, it's a good read.<br />My major complaint with the novel comes from Vinge's treatment of the alien Spiders.  Although he presents an interesting rationale for the extremely anthropomorphic approach he takes, it still never sat quite right with me.  There are significant differences between Spider and human society, yet Vinge downplays the alienness so much that it often seems that we are reading about just another human culture.  As a result, the various alien subplots were sometimes tedious reading.  The end of the story didn't quite play fair, either.  Perhaps it's my own fault for being an inattentive reader, but I missed any clues Vinge might have left as to the ultimate nature of the communication between the humans and Spiders.  Therefore, the resolution seemed to come out of left field.	2001-12-16

The ship crashes on a water world and struggles for survival as the &quot;Galactics&quot; battle overhead for the right of capture.<br />I was not so impressed with &quot;Sundiver,&quot; the first book in the Uplift series.  I'm so glad that I didn't stop there.  &quot;Startide Rising&quot; is an exceptional read.  David Brin has a unique talent for constructing consistent, plausible alien world-views.  When I saw that dolphins were major protagonists in this story, I was half-expecting some kind of new age pseudo-philosophy about the wisdom of the deep and the lessons that we humans need to learn.  Brin, however, is nowhere near as simplistic as that.  There is wisdom in his dolphins, but there is also avarice, ambition, brutality and other characteristics that are unique to the species.<br />The novel is somewhat more convoluted than necessary, and it seemed to me that several major plots were left unresolved.  Perhaps that will be addressed in future books.	2001-12-11

The opening sequence, featuring a group of disheartened and frightened men awaiting their fates  on an island that has been forgotten in the world-wide conflict that is raging, is pretty suspenseful.  The second part, featuring the villain of the title, is frequently entertaining as well.  One scene, which features a battle between dirigibles and men on horseback, rises to the level of high adventure.  Unfortunately, the character of Una Persson, another interdimensional traveler who makes brief appearances in all of the Bastable books and is well-developed in none of them, figures prominently in the climax.  There is also some sketchy mumbo-jumbo about a council of people who have the power to travel between dimensions.  Could have been better.	2001-11-15

The concept of Uplift, in which races achieve sentience via genetic manipulation by more advanced species, is very interesting, but it is pushed too far into the background here.  I was also disappointed by the resolution of the mystery, which made the scope of the story much more narrow and trivial than it could have been.  There were also some plot elements, such as the main characters schizophrenia and the trauma in his past, that really didn't amount to much.

Quite the contrary, I found the end to be flawed, which is why the book loses one star from me.  After such an uncompromising look at the dysfunctional world of Ignatius J. Reilly and his utter inability to cope with the modern world, I felt that the finale was the literary equivalent of the feel-good ending that has been tacked on to a film that has not tested well at advance screenings.  Given what had gone before, I really didn't see how Ignatius could end up anywhere but a mental hospital.  This is not to impugn John Kennedy Toole's honesty as a writer.  Given the fact that Toole committed suicide before his book saw publication--according to Walker Percy's introduction, it would probably never have been published had his mother not shopped it around after his death--I wonder how much Toole himself was like Ignatius; it may be that giving his story a hopeful ending was his way of encouraging himself as well.  I was also put off by the over-the-top stereotyping of the gay characters.<br />The above-mentioned reservations notwithstanding, this is a remarkable work of black humor; although I laughed frequently, I was also struck by the real pain in these characters' lives.  A very unique reading experience.	2001-09-30

Nicols misses no opportunity to endow his characters with bad breath, crusty nostrils, dirty teeth and any other repulsive characteristic imaginable, all of it described in loving detail. They wander through a nightmarish world of violence, poverty and sickness, both suffering and inflicting suffering on others, all told in a psuedo-literary style that is intended to signal us that something Frightfully Important is being related.

US	49738138	R3QXBO08TK87LJ	0891901531	950650389	The Land Leviathan	Books	2	2	3	N	N	Don't bother	Moorcock's meditation on racism and nationalism is obvious and dull.  His hero, the dimension-hopping Oswald Bastable, finds himself on an earth where technological advance has unleashed man's basest, most aggressive tendencies, leading to total war on a world-wide scale.  The author has plenty of opinions, but hardly a clue as to how to wrap them in a coherent storyline.  A few historical personages appear, such as Gandhi as the president of a pacifist country, but they are not used in a way that provides any insight into their characters beyond what everyone already knows (ie, Gandhi was a pacifist).  White authors always court disaster when they attempt to write about black rage over slavery and discrimination, and Moorcock embarrasses himself by creating the Black Attila, who crusades to make the earth safe for his people.  Finally, Moorcock has the bad habit of setting up a &quot;mysterious situation&quot; whose explanation should be as painfully obvious to his protagonist as it is to the reader.  Yet he writes as if nobody can guess what he has planned.  For example, during Attila's invasion of America with his irresistable weapons, the evil racists put black people into cages which are mounted atop the walls that encircle their position.  What on earth, we are expected to wonder, could they have been placed there for?  Then, when it is revealed by our suitably shocked narrator by they are to be used as a human barricade, we are expected to be surprised.<br />I know that Moorcock is capable of crafting a good story, but this isn't one of them	2001-07-09

Scout Finch's world is full of wonder and mystery.  When her father, the lawyer Atticus Finch, takes the case of a black man who has been falsely accused of raping a white woman, she begins to see and understand both the ugliness that exists in the world and the meaning of true heroism.  Harper Lee's novel must be one of the most perceptive narratives from the viewpoint of a child ever written.	2001-07-07

Plot elements, such as the sojourning spacecraft and the king who wanted to build a stairway to the stars, come and go without amounting to a unified whole.  Character does not seem to be a major concern for Clarke, which is fine if you have as strong a plot as he did in, for example, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama,&quot; but I did not find the struggle to build the space elevator sufficiently interesting in and of itself to satisfy me.	2001-07-02

According to several reviewers, my enjoyment of that series will be curtailed by having read this prequel first.  Oh, well.  I still plan to read the rest of the books because I enjoyed this one so much.  John Christopher makes a very interesting and effective choice when he chooses to tell his story entirely from the point of view of his adolescent protagonists.  We know only what they know.  Their lives go on fairly normally for a time, even after the Tripods have arrived on Earth.  But things begin to go gradually wrong until, by the end of the book, the Tripods are firmly in control of the Earth and our protagonists are fleeing for their lives with every hand turned against them.  Very good.  And the Tripods' method of taking over is chilling.	2001-06-25

Therefore, I may not be the best audience for this literary explication of existentialism.  Having said that, I found Satre's prose frequently evocative, but his hero, Roquentin, was extremely frustrating.  Indeed, his bouts of existentialist horror triggered by such everyday realia as chairs, trees, and hands made me wonder whether he was mentally disturbed.  Of course, I don't believe that all existentialists are insane, but I do wonder which came first, the chicken or the egg--is this philosophy a clear-eyed look at reality that naturally leads to ennui, or is it a rationale for inaction and fear constructed by highly intelligent depressives?  Perhaps Woody Allen said it best: &quot;The mind is the most over-rated organ in the body.&quot;  If it makes us catatonic with horror at the sight of a tree, then ignorance really is bliss.	2001-06-17
US	49738138	R2U66WKQYZEIGL	0140156046	937703555	Libra (Contemporary American Fiction)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Excellent	A brilliant imagining of what may have happened behind the scenes of the 1963 Kennedy assassination.  There are no diabolical masterminds here, just confused, pathetic men for whom the weaving of secrets is both a means of control and a natural expression of their own frustrations.  There is no intricate conspiracy, rather an accumulation of events that ultimately explodes into a national tragedy.  The book makes the point that cause and effect are very slippery concepts when it comes to history.	2001-06-04

The indigenous life-forms of Genellan are basically direct analogues of Earth creatures.  The sentient aliens are so recognizably human in their psychology that the only significant barrier to understanding between the species is the lack of a common language.  Nevertheless, the depiction of stranded humans struggling to survive is compelling and, despite the abovementioned misgivings, I found myself moved at times by the struggle to find common cause among the various species.	2001-03-30

Gordon Liddy.  Is this satire fair to Nixon and his gang?  I don't know, but I suspect that it is.  At any rate, it remains a witty parable of hypocrisy in high places and, given the rate at which our technology is improving, its comments on surveillance are bound to keep this book topical for quite some time to come.	2001-03-02
US	49738138	RE8W80EACWAR3	0671704184	257613214	Weaveworld	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Epic	An impressive novel in which the villains have just as many vulnerabilities as the heroes.  Clive Barker demonstrates here that he possesses one of those big imaginations that can build worlds in which exist characters and events that can keep me involved for over 700 pages.  His prose is also quite extraordinary--the book is filled which interesting turns of phrase and unexpected perspectives.<br />What impressed me the most is that, although there is plenty of magic in this story, the villains are not undone by anything so simple as the destruction or utilization of some particularly powerful magical artifact.  Even the most powerful, godlike beings are shown to have frailties and weaknesses, and it is these that ultimately lead to their downfall.  Good work, Mr. Barker.	2001-01-25
US	49738138	R2DWB5WFXUSZO7	0679426620	543344242	Havana Bay	Books	4	11	13	N	N	Very good...yet disappointing	The first three novels about Arkady Renko were strengthened by a powerful story arc that developed throughout the books--his banishment from and return to mainstream Russian society and the slow development and eventual cosummation of his romance with Irina.  Irina's presence figured heavily in Arkady's life throughout those books; even when she was not present, her presence was strongly felt. <br />With those story arcs concluded, &quot;Havana Bay&quot; feels a bit superfluous.  Worse than that, Irina has been eliminated before the events of the novel even begin.  Was this really necessary?  For those of us who followed Arkady as he struggled through that difficult romance, this is a very disappointing choice on the part of the author.  Couldn't Irina have been waiting at home while Renko had his Cuban adventure?  Is the idea of a happy Renko so intolerable?  Cut the man a little slack, Mr. Smith!<br />Nevertheless, this book is very enjoyable.  The mileau is perfect: decadent, sleazy opportunists scheming in the midst of a crumbling society.  Although Martin's Cuba isn't as fully realized as his European locales, his eye for telling detail and interesting local color remains sharp.  Arkady's ally, Ofelia Osorio, is a fascinating protagonist--I would be happy to read a book about her alone.  She possesses the passion for finding the truth that seems to be somewhat dimmed in Renko this time around.	2000-12-08

I lived in Japan for three years, and although I never encountered any people of the type revealed in these vignettes, nothing I read in these pages conflicts with my own understanding of Japanese society.      The final section, about a computer-obsessed otaku, is an unfortunate way to end the book.  It's speculations on the melding of man and machine are overdone; furthermore, it falls back on the old cliche of attributing whatever aspect of Japanese culture is under discussion to the Japanese' lack of a strict prescriptive system of morality.  However, Greenfeld's book is very strong when his focus is narrowed to the motivations and activities of individuals.	2000-11-26

The story alternates between the exiles in the past, ageing and battling mental illness brought on by their isolation, and the activities that resulted in their sentences.  The primary character, Jim Barrett, struggles to maintain his deteriorating community while investigating the puzzle of a new prisoner who is unlike any of the others.  The end is a bit unsatisfying--merely a conversation that wraps up the various plot points.  Published in 1967, this novel nevertheless includes some startling predictions of later political developments, including an inconclusive presedential election that had very unfortunate results!	2000-11-24

In addition, the first third of the book, which explains how adventurer Oswald Bastable traveled to the future, is really an enormous non-sequitur.  There is really no reason for the protagonist of this story to be a visitor from the past and, other than establishing that fact, nothing that happens at the beginning has any bearing at all on what happens in the rest of the story.	2000-11-20

I didn't expect deathless prose, but neither did I expect the writing to be quite so poor nor the plot to be so mediocre.  This would make for a very average episode were it to be filmed for television.  When I read a novel based on a television series, I want to see a story that puts the characters in situations that we can't see on the tube, be it for budget considerations, mature story content, or whatever.  I haven't read anything alse by Charles Grant, but I understand that he has a reputation as a horror writer of some quality.  If so, he must have cranked this one out in a hurry for the paycheck.	2000-11-11

It's interesting that humanity requires a common enemy, the Beast Things, in order to unite it.  This displays a realistic  understanding of human psychology that is undermined to some extent by an ending in which everything is wrapped up a bit too tidily.  There is a problem with pacing--the most exciting scenes occur in the middle of the story.  Also, the Beast Things just never seemed like a particularly menacing presence outside of the abandoned cities which were their lairs.  More of the novel should have happened there.	2000-11-03

Perhaps the communications from beings  that live in stars and the existence of a hidden ship that just happens to  be awaiting the arrival of our hero  wouldn't have seemed so left-field if  I had known that this was the third book of a series when I began it.  I  presume that these are plot elements left over from the first two books.   Isn't there some way to let the reader know that before he begins  reading?<br />At any rate, I plan to go back and read the prior books before  forging ahead.

The explanation for the hero's talent was  a bit too far-fetched and his motivation for penetrating into the dangerous  Hospital was extremely weak.  There was also that annoying streak of  fascism that surfaces so often in science-fiction, particularly that of the  &quot;Old Masters.&quot;  Both oppressor and oppressed alike seem the  recognize a need for capital punishment and concealing from the public the  true circumstances surrounding it.  It is up to extraordinary individuals  to make rational choices about what is good for the common man.<br />I give it  three stars for its solid prose and the imaginative story that kept me  reading despite the above-mentioned flaws.
