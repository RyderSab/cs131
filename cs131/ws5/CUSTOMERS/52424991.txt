I was stunned to find there are no reviews of this book here at Amazon. This book is a great read. I had trouble putting it down! The author is a professor of literature and makes an apology for stepping outside her field (of literature) to write a book about plastic surgery, but it is PRECISELY her background that makes this book so wonderful.<br /><br />The topic is well-researched and yet presented in layman's terms and the stats and facts are nothing but mind blowing. She makes references to Frankenstein, which prompted me to go read THAT classic and she's right; we're now formed by society's impressions of our physical appearance (which is the link to Victor Frankenstein's monster).<br /><br />If you think about this, it's rather insane. When people's appearance is improved, they're treated better by society and that gives them more self-confidence and inner peace. How bass-ackwards is that?<br /><br />I don't know when I've read a more thought-provoking book than \\"Flesh Wounds.\\" I find myself quoting from it to friends again and again. And it's also proving INVALUABLE in writing my own book about internet dating. (Available August 2005).<br /><br />Rose Thornton	2005-06-14

It's a great idea for a story and a worthy story that needs to be told, but...<br /><br />Some of the information contained in this children's book is not accurate. I know, I know, this book is \\"just for kids\\" but aren't children worthy of historically accurate information? The beauty part of historical fiction is that it's a fictional account told within the solid framework of accurate historical details.<br /><br />THere are many problems with this little book, such as the telling of how one of the children used leftover pieces and parts from the Sears kit house to \\"build a treehouse.\\"<br /><br />These were pre-cut kit homes and the only leftover pieces and parts would be small bits of trim moulding (which was approximately sized, but not precisely pre-cut). Hard to build a treehouse from 87 2-inch and 3-inch pieces of window trim and baseboard.<br /><br />There are other parts of the story that are lacking, too. That being said, I like the pictures a lot. They're cute, colorful and the children look real and happy.<br /><br />Rose Thornton<br /><br />author, The Houses That Sears Built	2002-05-04

When I ordered this book in February of 2002, my marriage of 24 years was a mess and he was a mess and I was a mess. Things just kept getting worse and worse. His \\"outbursts\\" were becoming increasingly severe and his aim was also improving.<br /><br />In desperation, I read this book and read it again and read it yet again. Screwing up all my courage, I went to my husband and told him that he needed to get help or we needed to end our marriage. He opted for Door #2. The next five years - living alone and learning how to be independent - were not easy, but it's when times are hard that we are forced to grow the most.<br /><br />Friedrich Nietzche said, \\"that which does not kill us makes us want to die.\\" Oh wait, his quote was, \\"that which does not kill us makes us stronger.\\"<br /><br />Yeah, that's it. During those five years, I wandered a bit in the wilderness and then found my feet and grew in more ways than I imagined possible. I wouldn't take a kajillion dollars to walk down that path again, but I also can't even begin to express how grateful I am to Ms. Evans for writing this book.<br /><br />If you're in an abusive relationship, you probably feel very isolated and painfully alone. This book will help break that spell. It speaks the truth that will set you free from the hell of living with an angry, unhappy and hurtful man.<br /><br />With apologies to Meister Eckhart, I quote one of his most famous lines, with a minor adjustment: \\"If you're frightened of divorcing an angry man[actually, Eckhart said 'dying'] and you're holding on, you'll see demons tearing your life away. If you've made your peace, then the demons are really angels freeing you from the pain of a horrid marriage [earth].<br /><br />Now that I'm five years out of that bad marriage and my new life is well under way and I've made my peace, I am able to see that those demons really were angels - in the form of words penned by Ms. Evans - that came into my life and set me free.ose demons really were angels - in the form of words penned by Ms. Evans - that came into my life and set me free.	2002-02-21

When I was a teen, I decided that if God in heaven couldn't help me with my problems here on earth, I wanted nothing to do with Him (or Her).<br />This book made God's love PRACTICAL in my day-to-day life.<br />If God is Love, as the Bible says, then God's love must have the power to heal any messy situation humans can find themselves mired in.<br />Science and Health explains more about God and how to use His (or Her) power to address and correct and heal those human problems.  I started really studying this book about 15 years ago and I've learned how to use prayer to heal deep depressions, physical problems and even relationship issues.<br />This is not a self-improvement book per se.

Mrs. Eddy, the book's author, says that it is never God's will for us to be sick or sinful.  That we have divine authority to rise above these problems and be conquerors, *because* God is all good!<br />Mrs. Eddy proved these ideas in her own life and then wrote this book so she could teach others what she had learned.<br />This book changed my life because it really introduced me to God and showed me that He never would create anything that would hurt His beloved child.  And beyond that, I learned how to make prayer practical and applicable to every human need.<br />This book really brings to light the &quot;good news&quot; of the Bible.

I don't want anyone to see that I'm letting you do this.&quot;  In Davis' book, she states that we have a legal right to read our own medical charts. Her book is full of this type of &quot;been there, done that&quot; advice.<br />The next to last chapter, which gives some information on hospice and practical advice on how to sit by the bedside when it's time for your loved one to leave this world, was very well written and is alone worth the price of this book.<br />I've read many of these books and this is one of the few that I'd highly recommend.	2000-12-08

It was my beloved big brother who first pointed out to me that Tootle was really a story about conforming to societal pressures. After his comments, I read the book with \\"new eyes\\" and was shocked.<br /><br />Tootle is told that if he ever wants to amount to anything, he'd darn well better, \\"Stay on the rails\\" (ie: remain in the ruts of life). Like the young, innocent child, er, train that he is, Tootle persistently rebels at this idea.<br /><br />Yet throughout the book, the mesmeric, lock-step-enforcing mantra that is drilled into Tootle is \\"Stay on the rails!\\"<br /><br />Midway through the book, we read, \\"Next day, Tootle played all day in the meadow.\\" The two-page illustration shows us that Tootle is happy; down deep to his iron-welds happy. There's a lovely daisy-chain draped around his front boiler plate; colorful butterflies dance around his head. His steam whistle bellows a happy tune. And Tootle's expressive choo-choo face - his eyes, nose and mouth - bespeak a profound joy.<br /><br />This is Tootle's best moment. And this is where the book should have ended.<br /><br />But no, this is not where the book ends. Tootle has a lesson to learn. In the end, Tootle is \\"cured\\" of jumping off the rails and enjoying the simple joys of life and frolicking in the meadow. Like his co-workers, er, fellow locomotives, he dutifully shows up for work each day and never questions, never rails against the sameness of his lot in life. At the end of the book, Tootle has been so thoroughly brainwashed that he is now advising the other young workers, \\"stay on the rails, no matter what.\\"<br /><br />We weep with Tootle and for Tootle, in that he has been taught by well-meaning \\"friends\\" to live a life more ordinary. I can only recommend Tootle for parents who want their children to \\"stay in the ruts of life, no matter what.\\"<br /><br />On the plus side, the pictures sure are cute. I really like happy train pictures.	2000-12-07

Sherry was the kind of daughter every mother would be proud of and grateful for. She stood by her mother through the whole experience and provided support in every way. And that was my favorite part of this book - the story of how Sherry handled different problems and remained her mother's number one cheerleader and support.<br />But as far as the practical wisdom I could glean from the book - there was not enough of that for me. The book is a quick read - and I found the second part of the book a little slow and impractical. The treasure bag was a cute idea, but not one that would be useful in our circumstances.<br />Of this type of book, I'd more highly recommend &quot;The Alzheimer's sourcebook for caregivers&quot; by Frena Gray Davidson. That book was a little more polished and had more tidbits and details on getting through the day when the depression and exhaustion starts to swamp you.<br />&quot;Visiting Mom&quot; is an important book and has received glowing reviews from everyone here - so maybe it will be the book that speaks right to your heart. But other than a few lines here and there, it was not the book for me.	2000-10-29

Frena Gray Davidson has written a very spiritually centered book that will inevitably help any caregiver and their loved one.<br />She speaks about how we'll see the &quot;divine child&quot; untouched by darkness or sickness - our loved one - emerge in this process. And she states that we must listen to the feeling behind the words. That little statement has changed my life. When someone asks for their mother, who may have passed on decades earlier, they're really seeking comfort and security and reassurance. We need to hear their feelings that lie in back of their words.<br />She goes on to say that 30% of language is verbal, the rest is expressed in body language and behavior.<br />Further on she makes the observation that Alzheimer's patients are sensitive to the thoughts of those around them and to always give plenty of Love, both in word, action and thought.<br />She states that &quot;unconditional Love is not a measure, it is a flow. You cannot give it or get it, you can only be part of it. When you love a person with Alzheimers, clarity and awareness come to that person.&quot;  [p149]<br />The other wonderful point she makes is that so much of our disappointment in Alzheimers patients is tied to our notion of their &quot;proper&quot; mortal identity. Your mother doesn't know she's your mother anymore, but you can value and cherish who she is in the here and now. Don't live in the past but nurture the childlike qualities she is expressing in the present.<br />Tons of good advice. The other book I'd recommend for anyone dealing with Alzheimers is &quot;Science and Health with key to the Scriptures&quot; by M. B. Eddy. It is a terrific sourcebook on powerful prayers that heal and restore. It is the &quot;how-to&quot; book of prayer.	2000-10-23

For a coffee table book with lots of pretty pictures and glossy photos, it's great.<br />But as a research tool to learn more about the day to day life of Victorian-era homes, it is not what I expected.<br />First off, the homes that are featured in this book are grandiose and ostentatious examples of Victorian mansions. The rooms pictured are cavernous and the furnishings look like museum pieces. For decorating and interior design hints, this would be a good resource.<br />I was looking for a book that told the *why* of old house living. WHY does my modest 1904 Builder's Style home have that hole, that niche, that pipe, that THING over there? What did it do and what was its purpose?  [Incidentally, after 4 years of searching, I've abandoned hope of finding a book that answers those questions and am in the process of WRITING a book that answers those questions.]<br />&quot;The Secret Life of Victorian Houses&quot; does not address those type of questions. Nonetheless, it was good enough to be rated a &quot;keeper&quot; in my ever growing library of Old House Information.<br />There is quite a bit of text with good information and useful knowledge. Just not near enough.<br />If you want to know what life was like in our SIMPLE homes 100 years ago, I recommend Susan Strasser's &quot;Never Done&quot; and &quot;Victorian America&quot; by Thomas Schlereth and if you want to know everything there is to know about old house heating systems, try &quot;The Quiet Indoor Revolution&quot; by Bud Konzo.<br />But this book - &quot;secret life&quot; is not really for dig-in-the-dirt types like me. It's more for people who hire other people to make their fantastic old mansions look fancy and fine.<br />Again, it's focus is solely on interior design, *not* mechanical systems or construction techniques.<br />Rose Thornton	2000-09-28

Someone at a construction-type website told me about this book. (BTW, thanks Bob!)<br />I am writing a book detailing mechanical systems in turn of the century homes and when I found this book, I literally couldn't put it down. As I read it, previously obscure details of home heating systems became crystal clear and I made little noises as these revelations dawned in thought.<br />I was amazed. It is a book explaining the most technical aspects of old house heating systems, but it does so in a very lively and interesting manner. Woven throughout the book are the author's own anecdotes and reminiscenses, which make the book an easy read.<br />The author and his family lived in a house in Illinois that was built soley for the purpose of monitoring, studying and recording heating systems in the home. He covers the 1920's (coal furnaces) and on up to the late 1980's.<br />If you want technical, this book has plenty of that. (I did not read every page) But the book is also just a fascinating read on the how and why of old house heating systems.<br />And despite the fact that I've now read hundreds of books on old houses, &quot;Bud&quot; Konzo explained things in a way that made it so very easy to understand.<br />One tiny example - electricity was generally available in cities by the early 1920's, but blower fans weren't installed in the countless old gravity-fed furnaces until the mid-1940's.<br />And why, you ask? (At least, that's what I was wondering...)<br />In the 1920's, electricity cost about 10 cents per kWh, the equivalent of $2 an hour today. Because of this, forced air heating systems did not really catch on until the mid 1940's.<br />Tidbit Number 2 - Not everyone wanted a blower fan on the gravity fed furnaces. (gravity-fed means it relies on convection currents to carry heated air up through the vents and registers.)  Gravity fed furnaces were silent. No blower noise. Early blower fans were noisy: Quietness was an important feature of the home.<br />Bud has written a treasure here. I'm shocked I'd never heard of it before.

At the end of my daughter's kindergarten class (she was 5) I was told by her school that she would probably start reading in first grade. Half way through first grade, I was told she was a little slow and not picking up  things as fast as she could. At this point, I stepped in and taught my  daughter to read using &quot;Noah Websters' Blue Backed Speller&quot; and  &quot;McGuffey's Readers.&quot;<br />&quot;McGuffey's Readers&quot; are a  delight. I read the books cover to cover and loved every single story  contained therein. These two literary tools [the Readers and the BB  Speller] were how America learned to read for 150 years. And after  *wasting* 18 months listening to reading &quot;specialists&quot; in public  schools, *I* taught my daughter to read in under 6 weeks.<br />She is now a  rising 8th grader and a prolific reader.<br />I *highly* recommend McGuffey's  Readers for any parent who wants to teach their child to read. It is a book  you will keep forever, and it is something to be handed down to your  children and their children and on and on.<br />And as a prior reviewer  stated, they are a real keyhole peak into a bygone time. Plus, the stories  are very moral and leave a strong [good!] impression on young minds.	2000-07-31

After having read several of Lewis' books, I read &quot;A Grief Observed&quot; which quickly became my favorite. It is his journal - and almost too personal - where you bear witness to Lewis' progress as he  sloughs his way through the deep mire of sorrow and grief.<br />In the first  pages of the book, he tells of going to God, seeking relief from the agony  he feels in his heart over the fresh loss of his beloved wife, Helen Joy,  only to find - the door slammed and the sound of the door being bolted and  doubled bolted from the inside.<br />He rails against God and his faith is  stirred to its core.<br />In the end, he finds his way back to God, but it is  not an easy journey or a primrose path.<br />For all of Lewis' intellectual  reasonings and scholarly attainments, I find &quot;A Grief Observed&quot;  to be his best work because it comes from the very heart of a man seeking  to find the answers to life's hardest questions. It is not a philosophical  insight or an intellectual wrangling, but a spirit-filled work that lays  bare the heart of a man who loved his wife completely.<br />This is an  important book. Read it. You'll be changed.	2000-07-20

When I read this book, I found it  so inspiring that I actually made copious notes of his insights and advice.  Something I'd never done before. Then I strove to *live* those  insights.<br />It's a good read and a very worthwhile book for anyone wanting  to plumb beneath the surface of things and discover the keys to happiness  and peace.	2000-06-25

It was (and is) a terrific book and I was a teen in the early 1970's when I first read this book. A teen reviewer's comment (in a prior post) that &quot;no 15 year old could be this naive about drugs&quot; is not quite  accurate.<br />Things were VERY different for teens 25 years ago. Our world  has changed a lot in these last 3 decades, but the message in &quot;Go Ask  Alice&quot; is timeless.<br />I'd STRONGLY recommend this book as required  reading for all teens, though as I recall, there is some inappropriate  language.<br />The ending is especially troubling and though I've read  thousands of books in the last thirty years, I can still remember MUCH of  &quot;Go Ask Alice.&quot;  It is a powerful message with imagery and word  pictures that make deep and lasting impressions.	2000-06-19

Writings&quot; is  &quot;Ways that are vain&quot; which is one of the best explanations of  evil that I've ever seen in print. If you liked C. S. Lewis'  &quot;Screwtape Letters&quot; you'll also appreciate Mrs. Eddy's article  &quot;Ways that are vain.&quot;<br />If you just want to know more about Mary  Baker Eddy, this book really gives an inside look at the woman's life and  work. &quot;Retrospection and Introspection&quot; (in Misc. Writings) is  Mrs. Eddy's autobiography and is a great read.<br />This is a THICK book -  well over 1,000 pages and it is stuffed full of practical wisdom, good  information and specific instruction on how to pray more effectively.<br />I  highly recommend this book, as well as Eddy's more well known book  &quot;Science &amp; Health, with key to the Scriptures.&quot;	2000-06-19

You have to love an evangelical Christian who would even dare to write a book with a title like this.<br />Christianity MUST BE a &quot;thinking man's  faith&quot; and BECAUSE OF THAT, we can't be afraid to ask and answer the  hard questions.<br />Elijah Lovejoy, first martyr of the free press, (look up  his life story if you don't know this name - he's a fascinating historical  figure!) is quoted as saying &quot;Truth has nothing to fear from  investigation.&quot;<br />Yancey investigates God, Truth and does it in a way  that really brings the reader along and opens up dialogues that are a wee  bit scary. It also digs deep into the story of Job and explores that whole  conundrum in a new light. Lots of food for thought there.<br />The opening  story - about the young man burning his religious books - paints an  indelible scene in my thought that I will not soon forget.<br />On the down  side - I don't think this is Yancey's best work. His number one best book  (and my favorite book of the DECADE! ) is:<br />&quot;What's so amazing about  Grace.&quot;<br />I've given away four copies of that book SO FAR!<br />My  number two favorite Yancey book is &quot;The Jesus I Never Knew.&quot;  Another GREAT book, but not as good as his &quot;Grace&quot;  book.<br />&quot;Disappointment with God&quot; is in third place, but any book  that makes you think deeply about God, and draw closer to God, is well  worth five stars. This book certainly does do that.	2000-06-19

I read this book but wished I hadn't.<br />I love to read inspiring books and my favorite authors are Corrie ten Boom, Philip Yancey, C. S. Lewis, William Barclay, Ron Mehl, Norman Vincent Peale and countless others.<br />But  I would not recommend this book to my friends or relatives.<br />The  descriptions of violence and torture were so graphic and disturbing that it  took me some time to erase those horrific images from my thought.<br />The  wrongs committed against our martyred brothers and sisters in Christ should  never be forgotten, but do we really need all the details of their  unspeakably violent, painful and agonizingly slow deaths?<br />I don't think  so.<br />These martyrs didn't die so that we could still be talking and  reading about the specifics of their tortured deaths. They sacrificed their  lives in the name of Christ. I think the highest tribute we can pay to  these martyrs is to glorify God with our LIFE and strive EACH DAY to follow  the teachings of Jesus Christ, as outlined in the Sermon on the Mount.<br />In  summary - perhaps this book has a place in Christian history, but this book  does not have a place in my library and I'd advise my friends and family to  pass this one by.	2000-06-19

As  soon as the last word was read on the last page, it was &quot;Mama, please  read it again!&quot;<br />(how I miss those days, by the way!)<br />The book also  has a powerful message about Love that children understand and  cherish.<br />This is a wonderful book.

I'd recommend this be one of the first books you read as you start your spiritual journey. This is a profound book that will jolt you awake from your apathetic musings and stir you to the depths of your soul.<br />I was a  Christian for 12+ years before I picked up this little volume and it was of  inestimable worth for me, but I regretted not having read it much  sooner.<br />It's one of those books (like E. L. Prentiss's &quot;Stepping  Heavenward&quot;) that feels like it was written JUST for you.  &quot;Screwtape Letters&quot; has that same feel - that C. S. Lewis crawled  into your consciousness and described every mental battle you've ever had -  and explains that those subtle arguments which steered you away from  spiritual growth, were cleverly disguised devilish whispers.  As Lewis  points out, the path to hell is a gentle slope.<br />I highly recommend this  book to anyone who wants to learn how to differentiate between God's  thoughts and the lies of evil. &quot;Screwtape Letters&quot; pulls back the  curtain and reveals  evil's best kept secrets and oh-so subtle tricks.	2000-06-19

Violence, romance, passion, sex, betrayal, prophesy, war, victory, defeat, wisdom, foolishness, advice, guidance, knowledge, it is all there.<br />The Bible is indeed, the Book of books. I double dog dare ANYONE to read this  book cover to cover and THEN claim that it is not an interesting and  compelling book.<br />But beyond being interesting, it is The Word of God. For  many years, I investigated a number of different philosophies and faiths,  trying to find answers to those 1001 questions us deep thinkers can come up  with. The Bible soothed my troubled thoughts and satisfied my heart's  hunger. It is the wisdom of the ages.<br />Having problems in life? No need  to reinvent the wheel. The Bible tells of folks who have been through  exactly what you're facing and tells how they resolved their problems.<br />Need some Proverbial wisdom? Check out proverbs.<br />Corrie ten Boom,  (whose books I HIGHLY recommend) survived Germany's worst prison camps and  in the dozens of books this great Christian writer penned, she would  frequently refer to the Bible as &quot;God's Love letter to his  child.&quot;<br />That just sums it all up.	2000-06-08

Or that most homes had only one or two outlets and a light bulb  hanging from a string?<br />This book is a compendium of both fascinating  facts and substantial histories of the development of residential  electrical usage in our country.<br />I love old houses and historical  information, and perhaps because of that, I found this book to be a  fascinating read. Some parts of it were a wee bit dry, where he delved into  some of the more technical aspects of this modern utility, but the majority  of the book was a treasure.<br />After reading this book, and gaining an  better understanding of the history of electricity, I'd say, without  hesitation, that introducing the modern convenience of electrical current  into our homes may be the most significant discovery of the last 500 years.	2000-06-08

It's also filled with  thoughtful insights that make you go &quot;Wow, I never thought of that  Bible verse in that light before.&quot;<br />For that reason, I give it five  stars. Any book that gives you a deeper love of God (as this book does) is  surely worth five stars.<br />But his more recent book &quot;What's So Amazing  About Grace&quot; seems like it plumbs the depth of spirituality a bit  more. Kind of like the comparison of Mark's Gospel and John's Gospel.  Mark's writings are strong and clear, but John's message is so deeply  metaphysical you fear you may never glean all the spiritual nuggets  contained therein.<br />Not to irreverantly compare Yancey to John..., but  Yancey's books are always a joy to read. I just preferred &quot;What's so  Amazing About Grace.&quot;<br />However, after borrowing and reading &quot;The  Jesus I Never Knew&quot; I immediately bought my own copy. It is a good  foundational item for every Christian's bookshelf.	2000-06-07

And if you can't change it, change the way you think about  it.&quot;<br />This is a powerful book/audio tape. And it is narrated by Maya  Angelou, which makes it even more of a treasure.<br />I'd highly recommend  this book to anyone who wants to improve the way they think about life.	2000-06-02

I bought this book after 22 years of marriage and it was a wonderful resource. The book contains several stories of married couples who struggled through some VERY hard times to stay married. It provides a rare  keyhole peak into the intimate details and struggles of couples' lives.<br />And it proves that the great majority of good marriages come at a cost -  of much self-sacrifice, letting go, prayer and a deep desire to remain with  your spouse, even when the going gets *extremely* rough.

And it is a very  interesting book.<br />The author really lays her heart on the line - and  tells in wonderfully frank language how hard it is to truly live the  spiritual axiom - &quot;Not my will - but thine be done.&quot;<br />And it  also sums up Maya Angelou's maxim that &quot;we are all more alike than we  are different.&quot;<br />&quot;Stepping Heavenward&quot; was so close to my  own life that I felt compelled to keep reading it and find out how  everything turned out! I read the book in two days, snatching every spare  moment I could to race back to the book and see what happened next!<br />I  loved it. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone. In fact,  I'm buying more copies for Christmas presents and I've handed it off to a  school teacher hoping that she'll consider putting it on the required  reading list.<br />If you only buy three Christian books this year - I'd  recommend this book, Stepping Heavenward, along with &quot;What's so  Amazing About Grace&quot; and &quot;Science and Health with Key to the  Scriptures.&quot;<br />Three powerful books. Along with the Bible, of course,  but EVERYONE has a Bible.  :-)<br />If you order &quot;Stepping  Heavenward&quot; you won't be disappointed. And if you are, donate it to  the local library.

There is nothing we can do to  make God love us less and there is nothing we can do to make God love us  more. We are all honored guests at our Father's table. God has a place for  each of us. I am the one Jesus (and God) loves. The cross and only the  cross put to end for all time the law of eternal consequences.<br />These are  just a few of the pearls I've gleaned and readily remember from Yancey's  wonderful book.<br />This book is so rich and so filled with inspiration and  insight, you can't read it all at one time. I'd read a few pages, think  about it, read the same pages again, think some more, APPLY the truths to  my life - saw results, read some more, thought about it some more...and on  and on it went.<br />GOSPEL means &quot;good news&quot; and Yancey's book  &quot;What's so amazing about Grace&quot; is filled with good news. And it  will change you and change your life and open your eyes to see just what a  joy it is to be known as a child of God.  It is all good news.<br />By the  way, my other two books - if I were stranded on a desert isle - would be  [1]The Amplified Bible, [2]Science and Health with key to the Scriptures  and [3]&quot;What's so Amazing about Grace.&quot;  Those three would keep  me busy for a long time.	2000-05-16

(Argosy won) Now that we have riverboats all over  our state, this former governor now *works* for Argosy Gaming.<br />Rapes and  robberies went up 33% in Atlantic City, New Jersey after the casinos opened  there.<br />&quot;Bad Bet&quot; it tells of the subtle and overt techniques  casinos use to lure people in and entice them - to keep the money flowing.  Even the layout of casinos is done with much forethought as to the best way  to separate people from their money.<br />And O'Brien talks about how the  gambling industry goes looking for communities in economic straights to set  up shop.  (which is exactly what happened in our city)<br />This is a  powerful book. I think every local or civic leader that has a casino in  their community or is even considering allowing casinos in, should pause  and read this book.

His information could have saved me a bundle of dough.<br />If you're going to buy more than $50 on eBay, his book is an invaluable  resource.<br />And it's written in very understandable language. I'm about as  computer literate as Daisy, but I was able to understand and grasp  everything Sinclair talks about. (Daisy is my dog) <br />It's well laid out -  easy to reference and easy to read.

Hall racks, card  stands and hall chairs are all discussed in this chapter.<br /><br />Chapter Two is  \\"Death in the dining room\\" - which gets it's name from the slain  game often depicted on victorian dining room furniture - such as side  boards and buffets.<br /><br />Chapter Three is \\"Words to Live by\\" -  Samplers, wall hangings and other embroidered or metal stamped messages.<br /><br />Chapter Four is \\"When the Music Stops\\" which covers the  societal importance of pump organs and how music was very important to a  Victorian woman.<br /><br />Chapter Five is \\"Posture and Power\\" - a  chapter about living room (parlor) furniture.<br /><br />There are a zillion  interesting little factoids about life at the turn of this century. And it  does give you a good feel for etiquette and expectations and the rules back  then.<br /><br />And it answered questions for me - like \\"Why was parlor  furniture so uncomfortable and rigid?\\" Because Victorians placed great  emphasis on the importance of self-control as an invaluable discipline.  Comfortable furniture suggested mental laziness. (My paraphrase)<br /><br />So it  does give some insights into why things were the way they were. Lots of  history there.<br /><br />But when I picked it up, I thought it was a book on old  houses, not old furniture. I thought the title was an allusion to the fact  that 100 years ago, funerals were held in the dining room, which is the  reason many old house dining rooms have an entry door - so the visitors  could graciously and easily leave the house after the viewing. It is not  that kind of book. But I still enjoyed reading it.<br /><br />It is a large book  with one or more pictures of antique furnishings on every page. A good  resource for someone who wants to recreate a historic interior.<br /><br />Rose Thornton<br />author, The Houses That Sears Builtornton  author, The Houses That Sears Built	2000-05-12

Before reading this book, I had no idea how much dogs contributed to our war effort or how many lives they saved. This book really taps into the spiritual nature and intuitive sense and amazing intelligence of dogs.<br />It points out (one of hundreds of fascinating facts) that the Viet Cong  had tremendous respect for these dogs and their ability, and the VC made  the dogs a priority target because they were such a threat.<br />Every  handler says things like &quot;our dog saved the lives of every man in the  platoon that night...&quot;<br />It covers dogs in war from World War I  (1918) to Desert Storm (1990's).<br />Dogs in WWI were used as messengers and  to find the dead and wounded on the battlefield. The US government even  made gas masks for dogs, which was quite challenging, because dogs pant to  give off heat and the masks had to be designed to compensate for that  unique attribute.<br />&quot;War Dogs&quot; also points out that dogs have  the capacity to sniff out land mines with a greater factor of reliability  than modern equipment.<br />The stories are well written and you will never  look at a dog the same way again.	2000-05-11

The most incredible auction I ever saw on eBay was under &quot;HOT&quot; items (meaning it had over 30 bids) for &quot;a wee bit of good  advice.&quot; I couldn't resist, so I checked it out. Yes indeed, some  fellow was selling a few minutes of advice and counsel to the highest  bidder.<br />My purchases were primarily books, but I made some foolish  mistakes when I started buying on e-Bay. By the time I bought Sinclair's  book, I was a seasoned eBay buyer and seller, but after reading his book I  realized there was still quite a bit that I didn't know.<br />If you're going  to spend more than $50 on eBay in your lifetime (which by definition would  include everyone in the Milky Way Galaxy) you need to buy this book.<br />Good layout, good size, easy to read, simple writing style, yet very  informative and a fantastic price - considering the potential savings (and  profit) from following his advice.<br />The part I loved best - you don't have  to be a computer genius to read and comprehend what he's telling you. My  computer literacy is a few notches higher than Daisy's. (she's my dog) And  I was able to follow pretty much everything Sinclair is saying.<br />And  there's also a section on how to protect and defend yourself against  fraud.<br />It's over 400 pages and is fully indexed. Lots of good graphics  too.<br />Seriously - if you do more than a couple eBay transactions per  year, this book is needful and valuable. As much for buyers as for  sellers.<br />I'd have saved myself close to $100 if I'd bought it before I  started trading on eBay.	2000-05-05

Which is where I was headed. This book was a resource that did a good job of explaining the mechanics of flight. I had no idea there were so many back up systems  to every aspect of flying. And after you read this book, you understand  that if you are still afraid of flying, that particular fear really has  nothing to do with the plane or flying.<br />This book helped me pull the mask  off this fear and did a lot to promote healing.<br />Last time I boarded a  plane, I walked into the cockpit and had a long talk with the [Southwest]  co-pilot, who was *very* dear and understanding. He was funny, too. He  showed me how things work and reiterated the incredible safety record of  jet planes.<br />I wouldn't have dreamt of walking into that cockpit until I  read Debbie's book.<br />Just knowing the man who was flying the plane helped  tremendously.<br />And during the flight, I told hubby everything that was  going on. Because I had read this book so many times I knew everything that  was going on.<br />There are dozens, maybe hundreds of reassurances in this  book about the safety of jets. For instance, did you know that the WING  (there's only one wing on jet planes - it's a continuous piece of metal)  can flex up and down over 20 feet before breaking? Planes can take an  incredible beating and keep on flying.<br />And the wing[s] act as shock  absorbers so the fuselage maintains a more even flight.<br />This really was  a great book. Taught me an incredible amount of the how and why of flight.	2000-05-05

That's how this book is - you read a  verse and say &quot;Aha...so that's what that verse means..I never thought  of it in that light&quot; and then you have to think about it for a time  and let it sink in deep.

I had to find out what happened to this dear little boy.<br />And then I *RAN* to the library to get  the sequel and then I went back to get the third book in the series.<br />A  previous post is right - you'll never look at a child in tatters the same  way. And to me - that is one of this book's big messages. Several people  failed Dave as a child. How many people in school and in his neighborhood  saw this sad little boy but lacked the moral courage to help him out?<br />How many times have I seen a child like that, and went merrily on my  way? Hard questions, but thank goodness for Dave's strength and willingness  to bring these questions to our thought and our collective consciousness.<br />This book is a clarion call that we are all  responsible for the  children in our circle or village. I think we will all be held accountable  for looking the other way when we discovered a child in need.<br />A powerful  book. I highly recommend it - but be forewarned, the descriptions are  graphic.<br />And a last note - I am so grateful to hear Dave has been healed  of this dreadful past. I hope his story will be a shining light to show  others - full healing and restoration is possible.	2000-05-03

He shows how the words  and works of Jesus are applicable to every need of mankind in the here and  now. And the tone in his books is so down-to-earth, yet inspiring. It's a  wonderful balance and I loved this book.<br />However, I must confess - I  preferred &quot;Meeting God at a Dead End&quot; also by Mehl.

Not to repeat what several others have mentioned here in these well written reviews, but this is a wonderful book.<br />The most notable element I see in this book is that children do not pass ALONE. There is always a  loving presence - someone that goes with the child - and takes away their  fears and eases the transition.<br />There was one story about a young girl  (age 7) who tried to kill herself. She'd been the victim of horrible child  abuse and chose suicide as the only way out. She left her body and found  herself surrounded by &quot;a bubble of love and life&quot;. She was shown  a tree - encased in ice and snow - and told she was in the winter of her  life now, but that summer was coming and much joy was ahead of her in life.<br />She was 47 when interviewed for this book and her adult life had been  one of stability, joy and much peace.<br />The other good reason to buy this  book is because on page 147 is &quot;the rest of the story&quot; about the  1986 bombing of the elementary school in Cokeville, Wyoming.<br />Many of the  children who were there when the bomb went off (they'd all been stuffed  into one classroom by David Young, the bomber) told of  angelic beings that  gave them very specific instructions as to where to go to be safe.<br />Not  one or two, but many children talked about the angels, or &quot;nice ladies  who were all lit up&quot; and voices - all giving them clear  direction.<br />And by the way, only David Young died when that bomb went off.<br />This is a well written, informative, enlightening and good-news book.	2000-05-02

This is one of the most intelligently written NDE (near death experience) books I've ever read. (And I've read a few...) Dannion's story was an amazing one and he told it very well.<br />It is a compelling book - I found  myself devouring the book cover to cover and then perusing it a second  time.<br />One of the most interesting things I picked up on in this book is  his experience of returning to this life.<br />He had been sent down to the  morgue, with a sheet draped over his body, when he came back to life.<br />And he talked about the moment of decision - whether to go back or to  remain in the next life - and once that decision was made, his body stirred  and he was alive again.<br />This (to me) was a wonderful proof that there is  no power in the body. It is not the body that makes decisions about life.  Dannion's body was dead but once he decided to return to (this) life, the  body was restored.<br />The human scene shifted to correspond with the  spiritual reality and the spiritual decisions.<br />Read the book and draw  your own inspirations, revelations and education. It was a great read and a  book with much depth.	2000-05-02

Barclay's writings speak to me like none other. William Barclay passed on in the early 1980's, but thankfully, he left behind so much of his useful and practical knowledge.<br />Of these DSB series, John is my favorite.<br />Barclay's book on John says that this disciple was portrayed as  &quot;The Eagle&quot; because he saw things from a higher, more spiritual  view and his writings had more metaphysical meat to them.<br />Barclay's  exegesis on John really brings that out.<br />And the thing I love most about  this book is the practicality of his teachings. It's not a dry or dusty  interpretation, but a here and now explanation. He makes the writings of  these men come alive and then shows how the teachings of Jesus are  practical and applicable to all the needs of mankind - for now and  forever.<br />As someone else once said of this remarkable man, William  Barclay, &quot;he saved the Bible from the experts.&quot;<br />John was the  first of this series that I read. And then I went out and bought Matthew.  And then Luke. And then Mark and before I was done - I'd purchased and read  them all.	2000-05-02

It  is definitely a foundational book for every Christian's library.<br />The  only reason I didn't give it FIVE stars was because he didn't address a  loss that stings even worse than death - and that is rejection by a loved  one.<br />With spousal and parental abandonment going on in record numbers, I  think there is a great need for a work (like Zig's Confessions of a  Greiving Christian) on healing the grief occasioned by rejection and  abandonment.<br />He spoke frequently about how much love there was (and is!)  in his family and I loved hearing about it and I love his openess in  sharing his heart with all the world, but there are a lot of families that  don't have that strong anchor of love at their core, and they need healing  and support too.<br />Nonetheless, Zig's book is a treasure. It's too good to  borrow at the library. This is something you'll want for highlighting and  referring back to - again and again.	2000-05-01

This book is over 110 pages and every page has at least one picture, and most have two or three.<br />Beyond the good information re: color schemes, there is a lot of information in this book about the 101 details (fretwork,  finials, porches, etc) of an old house.<br />Unfortunately, there are  precious few old drawings and the ones they do have are done in muted  browns and beiges. Now, I know they didn't have color photos back in those  days, but I do wish they'd included more color pictures (drawings) of these  old houses.<br />There are also some very interesting old paint ads - such as  one that suggests the right house paint is *the* key to health and  happiness. The book also contains plenty of written information and  history, which is interesting reading.<br />And the photos/drawings offer a  nice blend of the ostentatious Queen Annes and by contrast, the simple and  modest &quot;Builder's Style&quot; homes.<br />I'm an old house purist trying  to redo my simple old home as authentically as possible. This book is a  good resource for that.	2000-05-01

Her writing style is so interesting and compelling. I read this book straight through - I simply could not put it down. After I finished this book, I read her other four biographical works, all very interesting, but I think &quot;caged bird&quot; was by far the  best of the group.<br />It is a book that gives you a deep abiding sense of  compassion for the gross inequities of Jim Crow laws and it gave me a  keyhole peak of what it meant to be black and poor.<br />Maya's description  of listening to the radio and cheering when Joe Louis won the heavyweight  championship will always stay with me. She spoke about how it felt to see a  black man triumph in the ring and that it was a victory for every black  man, woman and child, as well. My words are so inadequate to express the  depth of emotion and sense of joy which she conveyed so beautifully in her  book.<br />Read the book.

This book was required reading for my daughter's high school English class. She handed it to me one day and said &quot;Mom, this is a powerful book. I think you'd like it a lot!&quot; So I began to read the book and  she was right. I loved it.<br />I grew up in the South in the 1960's and I  love books about life in the deep south. This book is (sadly) very  believable and really enlarged my sense of compassion for humanity and more  precisely, opened my eyes ever more to the core issues of racial prejudice.<br />The language is graphic and some descriptions are pretty rough. As a  prior poster said - it is not a book for anyone under 16. It is a book for  mature audiences, only.<br />But what a book. It's one of those rare books  that gives a real paradigm shift. Things suddenly look quite different  after you've finished reading this book.	2000-04-29

When we adopted a 10 week old Sheltie (Daisy) I wanted a better experience. I wanted to learn how to really love dogs.<br />This book [and Daisy] helped me understand the depth and love and  compassion within these gentle animals.<br />A prior reviewer said that  Jeffrey Moussaieff simply created his dogs in his own image, but how can a  pet live with us for a lifetime without picking up on our emotional vibes?<br />This book is filled with compelling anecdotes and stories about dogs and  the unconditional love that is in their heart and soul.<br />One story from  this book - (from memory) Many decades ago, a man decides he wants to get  rid of his dog. He chooses to end the dog's life by drowning it. He rows  out into a large river and pushes the dog out of the boat. The dog ducks  under the boat and swins up on the other side and tries to crawl back into  the boat. The man goes to the other side of the small boat and using the  oar, pushes the dog back under the water. Dog again swims to the other side  and tries to crawl back in. The man is losing his temper. He stands up and  uses the oar to push the dog under and hold him under. In doing so, he  loses his balance and falls into the water. The dog saves his life.<br />I  shared this story with children I teach as an example of unconditional  love.<br />I don't know that we humans have really mastered this  unconditional love that bears no ill will, but just keeps pouring out  love.<br />The book is full of these stories.<br />I highly recommend it.	2000-04-28

The &quot;thou shalt nots&quot; of the 10 commandments can feel a little like a stern God admonishing us, but Mehl's book really shows the tremendous love and care behind each commandment and shows the spiritual depth of those 10 spiritual guides and landmarks. He casts a new light on  them, by explaining that they provide a fence of protection around God's  beloved children.<br />His chapter on the 7th commandment - adultery - is  alone worth the price of the book. He speaks frankly about how he counsels  young couples who wish to marry. It is a powerful chapter with much depth.<br />Mehl's writing style is warm and personable. His practical wisdom and  Christly humility speak through every word of this powerful little book.<br />I've spent 7 years working *daily* to live the 10 commandments, but this  book - &quot;The ten(der) commandments&quot; gave me many new insights and  profound revelations.	2000-04-27

I'm not sure how I first stumbled onto Barclay's work, but once I found his books - I couldn't stop! I've read this entire series of books - some of them I've read over and over again. In fact, the two volumes on Matthew and John I've read repeatedly.<br />His books are full of powerful quotes and  amazing stories and word pictures. His translations make such spiritual  logic. You find yourself saying &quot;Aha...&quot; over and over again -  because the truths he shares feel so much like something you've always  known - but needed a little help in understanding.<br />Barclay describes a  God who loves us, who cares for us, who forgives us and who wants only the  best of the best for us.<br />It opened my eyes and taught me how to love  myself *because* God loves me!<br />A favorite line I've always remembered -  Barclay quotes an old rabbinical saying &quot;In the life to come, a man  will have to give an account of all the good things of this life he could  have enjoyed - but did not.&quot;<br />Barclay's interpretation of the gospels  is full of &quot;Good news!&quot;	2000-04-27

(I was a very young Mom with two children) That was over 15 years ago and I still remember so much about this book. The author makes the point that being a  mother is not all sweetness and lace - but self-sacrifice and more  self-sacrifice. She makes a good point - that Motherhood is not for  everyone. It is a decision that should be made carefully and thoughtfully  and no one should ever be pressured into having a child.<br />Around this same  time, Ann Lander's survey came out - where she asked her readers - &quot;If  you could do it all over again, would you have children?&quot; And a large  majority said &quot;NO!&quot;.<br />This book explains the reasons some  folks regret having children.	2000-03-30

This book is a must in public schools	When I drove my Sheltie to the Vet to be spayed, she was shaking violently. Yet she was in that car *every* morning, riding with me on my errands. How could she know *this* morning was different? So, AS AN  EXPERIMENT, I changed my view. (I'd been apprehensive as well) I told the  dog, mentally, what was going on and also told her that she did not need to  be afraid. I told her that she may experience some discomfort after this  procedure, but it would be minimal and this surgery was in her best  interest and there would be a good outcome. I told her that Love was  present at the vet's office and the presence of Love forbade the entrance  of fear. Her shaking quickly stopped and she laid down comfortably in the  seat.<br />My childhood dog (he passed years ago) also was very sensitive to  thought.<br />Boone's book - Kinship with All Life - proves that these  examples are not the exception but the rule.  Reading this book (just  recently) has changed me forever. One of my all time favorites. I have  always assumed dogs were &quot;not too bright&quot; but I have now have  great respect for their capacities.<br />This book is a quick read, but it  causes a real paradigm shift in thought. Nothing IN THE UNIVERSE will look  the same after you read Boone's little treatise on animals.<br />One last note  - In every book I've read about life after life, there is one constant  theme - When the departed talk about returning home to say good-bye to  loves ones, they always add &quot;No one in the room could see me or hear  my words, but the dog kept barking at me and looked right at me...&quot;<br />Dogs see through the veil that obscures our own  thoughts.<br />rosethorn@home.com	2000-03-18

Books	1	203	224	N	Y	Kind of a so-so read and some mixed messages.	I agree with another reviewer who said his favorite part of the book was the first two chapters. Sums it up for me.<br />The rest of the book repeats the mantra - don't indulge in buying material goods - furniture, cars, etc.  (guns/butter theory) Save your money. Invest in things that will pay you.  Make money work for you; don't work for money.<br />Certainly a lot of wisdom  there, however, it's pretty basic.<br />I was troubled by the author's  attitude towards the average worker. Somewhat condescending. The author's  dad [poor dad] was a college professor. The *second dad* [rich dad] was a  neighbor who had invested in real estate and businesses and took young  Robert under his wing. Rich dad pointed out different folks in his employ  and told Robert &quot;you don't want to be like them.&quot;<br />And why is  that? Because they didn't have the vision to invest? Because they weren't  rich? Because they were working in service work? Wow. Kind of harsh.<br />One  gets the impression the investor dad [rich dad] worked constantly. A real  workaholic. Is that the model we should aspire to? This book uses money as  the measure of success. I have a problem with that.<br />College professor dad  [poor dad] and others like him who work 9-5 jobs and struggle to support  their families were regarded as parents of a lesser ability or lesser  vision.<br />The counter-argument might be, well, Robert retired at 47 years  of age. I don't know about Robert, but when I'm 47, all my kids will have  grown up and left home.<br />Robert makes good points. However, I found  myself getting swept away with the dream of being wildly rich and had to  stop and ask myself &quot;What are my goals in life? Where do I want to  spend my time? Invest my energies?&quot;<br />Robert makes the point that we  do have to get off the hamster wheel of doing things the way they've always  been done. Good point and well made.<br />However, I remember something an  older friend told me years ago. He worked two and three jobs the whole time  his kids were growing up, so he could invest and live comfortably at  retirement.

For the last 20 years, I've rehabbed old houses and loved the work. I've always wondered about the EPA's wild statements regarding HOW UNSAFE old houses are. Why didn't our grandparents and parents fall over dead from all  these hazards?<br />While writing an article about radon in the home, I  discovered Casandra Moore and her book and even had a chance to interview  her. I was so impressed with her, I came right to Amazon.com and bought her  book. **It is one of the finest books in print.** Period.<br />She speaks the  truth about these hazards in our home and each statement is substantiated  and supported.<br />It is a very interesting read and a very reassuring  read. No, our grandparents and parents did *NOT* fall over dead from the  hazards in these old houses and there's a reason they did not!<br />Too often,  the so-called hazards are completely overstated and blown out of all  proportion by a massive governmental bureaucracy's creative imagination or  a misplaced hope to save us from ourselves.<br />Moore's book reveals that  lead levels [measured by blood lead levels] have fallen from 60 micrograms  in 1970 to about 10 micrograms in 1990. That is a significant  decrease.<br />She also reveals that the US Public Health Service keeps  lowering the bar. Three times in 15 years,  they've decreased the *safe*  number for blood lead levels, which makes the numbers or percentages of  children at risk APPEAR to jump way up. Makes for hot headlines, but bad  information.<br />Her book is stuffed full of this kind of information. Very  very interesting.<br />This is a good read, an interesting topic, an important  book and a wonderful resource. I'd recommend it as a *must read* for anyone  who lives in a pre-1970 built house.<br />TO conclude, Moore has good news to  share. The EPA is not the final word on on our health and well being. We  are indeed, &quot;safe at home.&quot;<br />Rose	1999-09-29
