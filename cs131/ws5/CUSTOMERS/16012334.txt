Lessons From a Leader on How to Turn Around a Service Business	Books	5	0	0	N	N	About the Book-	Service Success!: Lessons from a Leader on how to Turn Around a Service Business   <br />  <br />ANNOTATION <br />Packed with practical ideas and strategies for service managers, this candid case study demonstrates how to improve performance and profitability in any service business. A success story himself, Kaplan pioneers a radical new system for measuring quality in the service industry.  <br /> <br />FROM THE PUBLISHER <br />Nine out of every ten new jobs created each year are in the service sector. Although service jobs are at the heart of today's economy, accounting for three-quarters of our GNP, there has not been, until now, a system that enables managers to accurately measure and improve service quality, productivity, and profitability. While manufacturing processes lend themselves to statistical measurement, the intangibles of quality service are much harder to quantify. In this book, Dan Kaplan - the man who dramatically transformed the money-losing Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation into the industry leader with an enviable profit margin - reveals the battle-tested methodologies he used in forging one of the recognized business success stories in the service field. Turnarounds in industry rarely come as 450-foot home runs, Kaplan explains. What is needed instead are 1,000 singles - the kind of steady incremental progress toward a goal that is responsible for most wins, in baseball and in business. In Service Success! Kaplan shows how, by deliberately employing a policy of \\"small wins,\\" leaders can bring people along with them as they challenge and move beyond the status quo, seeking always to make tomorrow better than today.  <br /> <br />FROM THE CRITICS <br />Publisher's Weekly <br />Total quality management (TQM) is the most significant managerial theory since 1980; unfortunately, its basic tenets are often obscured by numbing jargon and mathematical formulas. Kaplan, president of Hertz Equipment Rental Corp., and Rieser, a former editor at Fortune ,here craft one of the best applied TQM studies to appear this season. Starting with ``a set of simple methods that will enable managers to become more effective and productive,'' the authors describe the turnaround policies (statistical benchmarking, constantly refining service standards and building trust through commitment) employed by Kaplan at Hertz. While the authors' observations on operations management and financial controls are useful, their elaborations on corporate culture, management development and business ethics are particularly strong. (Apr.)  <br /> <br />Library Journal <br />The service sector of the U.S. economy is booming. Until recently, the number of books devoted to the management of services has been smaller than those devoted to manufacturing. These new titles are helping to change the situation. Targeting the service firm with fewer than 100 employees, the Rosses provide a how-to manual geared especially to newcomers to the service sector. They provide guidelines for such frequently encountered problems as formulating a marketing plan, motivating employees, and attracting favorable public relations. While most of the suggestions are already available in standard management libraries, these authors provide a remarkable service by assembling and distilling much of this information. Kaplan targets the larger service company. Presenting the management philosophy he developed while managing the turnaround at Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation, Kaplan details the successful application of TQM principles to a service setting. His core idea is that the ultimate success results from doing thousands of little things just a bit better than the competition. Managers will love this book because it resonates with the tone of a pragmatic manager who can express his ideas in a general way that any service organization can apply. Both books will serve libraries well.-- Gene R. Laczniak, Marquette Univ., Milwaukee	2004-11-10

There follow other episodes, centered on Greg, an American journalist, and Julio, his Mexican friend and collaborator. Taibo gives the reader a plethora of brilliant characters in this panoramic novel that moves backward and forward in time.  <br /> <br />FROM THE PUBLISHER <br />St. Martin's Press is proud to publish the first English translation of a major literary novel by Paco Ignacio Taibo II, whose previous appearances in this country have been this leading Mexican author's crime novels. The \\"four hands\\" are those of two world-ranging journalists, one Mexican and one American. It is these two men who provide the initially improbable links between such disparate elements of Taibo's amazing novel as Stan Laurel's witnessing the assassination of Pancho Villa; the Disinformation Operation of an anonymous group in New York who approach their dingy office up a fire escape; the discovery of Leon Trotsky's notes for the crime novel he was writing when he was murdered in Mexico; the stupefying thesis proposals of graduate student Elena Jordan; an episode in the Contra war in Nicaragua; and the Spanish miner's takeover of a coal mine in the thirties. These themes and others, like the voices of a Bach fugue, appear and disappear and reappear, gradually weaving together into an intricate whole without losing their separate identities. Four Hands is a funny, dazzling, and exuberant work that only this author could have created.  <br /> <br />FROM THE CRITICS <br />Publisher's Weekly <br />Two journalists-one Mexican, the other American-each tell the story of a plot to vilify the Nicaraguan Sandinistas in this complex tale that weaves together real and fictional characters including Pancho Villa, Stan Laurel and Harry Houdini. (July)  <br /> <br />Library Journal <br />At times reminiscent of Doctorow's work, Four Hands is a glorious documentary-style novel, offbeat and usually comic. Taibo (Some Clouds, LJ 6/1/92) focuses on two 1980s journalists. Both partners and friends, Mexican Julio Fernndez and North American Greg Simon write about politics and revolution for the likes of Mother Jones and Rolling Stone. Interwoven with their stories are strands of fiction and fictionalized nonfiction that span the decades of the 20th century, roaming from the Americas to Europe and back. Other characters include Stan Laurel, Leon Trotsky, and civil engineer and anti-Sandinista Ben Linder. Taibo, who lives in Mexico City, is already well known to Spanish-language readers. This novel belongs in all strong contemporary literature collections.-Mary Margaret Benson, Linfield Coll. Lib., McMinnville, Ore.  <br /> <br />BookList - Donna Seaman <br />Taibo is usually considered a crime writer due to such anarchistic detective novels as No Happy Ending , but even though espionage plays a role here, this hilariously disorienting tale is too slippery for a genre designation. The title refers to lucrative if frequently ludicrous partnerships, such as that of Laurel and Hardy (Stan Laurel plays a key role in this complicated narrative), and the collaboration of the novel's main characters, journalists Greg and Julio. Greg, Jewish and chronically alienated, is the photographer, while Julio, loquacious and sanguine, does most of the writing, although, four-handedly, they manage to crank out articles in both Spanish and English, doubling their earning potential. As they track down their latest story amid the chaos and fervor of Latin American politics, war, gun trading, and drug dealing, they inadvertently parallel Operation Snow White, the goofy, most likely pointless brainchild of a CIA operative named Alex. Taibo's cleverly fractured yet unmistakably pointed plot involves dwarfs both literal and figurative, Houdini, a long-lost manuscript of a mystery written by Trotsky, and wonderfully caustic musings on the cult of information. Taibo ranges all over the map, and we follow, curious and entertained.	2004-11-10

Divorced at age 35, she chose for her next husband ``Brant,' a man nine years her junior.

Documents his life and details the joy & anguish of his on-&-off love affair with college chum C.C. Dasham. <br /> <br />FROM THE PUBLISHER <br />It occurred to me today with something of a shock how horrible it would be for this diary of mine to be pawed over and read unsympathetically after I am dead, by those incapable of understanding... <br /> <br />And then the thought of the one thing even more dreadful and terrible than that - for my diary never to be read by the one person who would or could understand. For I do want it to be read - there is no use concealing the fact - by somebody who is like me, who would understand. <br /> <br />Jeb Alexander was a gay man who lived in Washington, D.C., during the first half of the twentieth century. From 1918, when he was nineteen years old, until the late 1950s, he chronicled his daily life engagingly and unsparingly, leaving behind a unique record of ordinary gay life before Stonewall, a history that has remained largely hidden until now. <br /> <br />Jeb came of age as the century did, witnessing and recording political and social change from the position of insider as an editor for the U.S. Government and outsider as a gay man. Painfully shy, and frustrated in his ambition to be a novelist by writer's block, Jeb turned to his diary as a way of expressing himself as well as recording events, creating a full emotional self-portrait and unforgettable sketches of the men who made up his lively circle of friends. <br /> <br />Jeb and Dash also details the joy and anguish of an extraordinary on-and-off love affair between Jeb and C. C. Dasham (Dash), whom he met in college and with whom he remained friends throughout his life. A rare and important historical document, a beautifully written memoir, a love story, an ode to old Washington, D.C., Jeb and Dash is a remarkable find and an enduring literary achievement.	2004-11-10

As a world-famous interior decorator, she has worked her magic on interiors large and small, from mansions and embassies to cottages and studio apartments. Through her writing and lectures, she has encouraged millions to brighten their lives and their homes by turning mundane tasks into small pleasurable rituals that add beauty and joy to everything they do. Alexandra Stoddard's secrets of Living a Beautiful Life are yours. <br /> <br />FROM THE CRITICS <br />Publisher's Weekly <br />Interior designer Stoddard (Style for Living, etc.t believes that ``only by paying careful attention to the simple details of daily tasks and to our immediate surroundings can we live vitally and beautifully all the days of our lives.'' Her syrupy, repetitious prescription for gaining control over life and uplifting the ordinary into restorative events is mostly commonsensical: i.e., making morning lists, using perfumed stationery, special china and bedding, finger bowls, massages, fresh produce, good lighting. But some readers will balk at bathing with citrus fruit slices, opening mail with a silver George III meat skewer or making the inside of the refrigerator ``a feast for the eye'' with flowers, and may be at a loss as to where they can purchase a ``Fragrance on the Line'' plastic disc of pure extract of perfume for insertion into a telephone mouthpiece. Unimaginative drawings are included. First serial to McCall's; BOMC alternate.

Inspiration for creative and colorful living is not only limited to ideas for the kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. Each of the six chapters ends with ``grace notes'' which are yet more ideas to make some of the small things in one's life enjoyable, whether it be letterwriting, weeding a garden, entertaining, or doing something special for a homebound person. As in her other two titles, Style for Living ( LJ 7/74) and A Child's Place ( LJ 9/15/77), individuality and personality are highly regarded. Recommended for public libraries.

Corporate Coach   <br />  <br />ANNOTATION <br />The founder and CEO of Miller Business Systems, who's built a solid reputation for going all-out for the customer and creating an upbeat, personable environment that keeps employees happy, loyal, and productive, presents a revolutionary work in which he likens managing a company to coaching a team by joining customers and employees in a common cause.  <br /> <br />FROM THE PUBLISHER <br />Jim Miller's bestselling book provides a revolutionary approach to team management and customer service that has helped his own company's sales rise from $50,000 to $150 million.  <br /> <br />FROM THE CRITICS <br />Library Journal <br />The founder of Miller Business Systems, an office supply company, presents his principles of customer focus that have enhanced his company's success. Through analogies, Miller relates his leadership concepts to sports teams, which will surely appeal to executives with annual box seats! All the current good ideas on serving customers, such as hiring customer-oriented employees, focusing internal processes on serving customers, constant systems redesign based on customer feedback, and long-term relationships with customers can be found in this program, read by the author. Although Miller's ideas are soundly rooted in the extensive literature in this genre, he offers little new information. Also, with the significant problems inherent in today's professional sports business, his attempt to relate complex team-based organizational success to successful athletic teams is outdated. Invest instead in the more substantial work from Ron Zemke (Working with Jerks, S. & S. Audio, 1989).-Dale Farris, Groves, Tex.  <br /> <br />BookList - Barbara Jacobs <br />Another business book filled with sports metaphors? Yes and no, because Miller (helped by coauthor Brown) does have a story to tell. And when the subject is teamwork, the language of the playing fields is appropriate--though admittedly overused. In anecdotalfashion, he relates and demonstrates how working in teams solves all potential employer issues: customer service, creativity, quality, sales, problem solving, and employee loyalty. What's more, the advice proferred is specific and complete with samples--e.g., don't separate work from home; reward frequently; watch body language and rely on gut instincts when hiring; and involve employees in strategy as well as service. After this easy, non-high-falutin' read, those who didn't understand the power of working (and playing) together will grasp it; those managers who already practice teamwork just might find they've honed their skills.	2004-11-10

It is a world of picturesque fishing ports like Treboul, of genteel resorts like Cabourg, which Proust called Balbec, and where he fell in love with Albertine and of old-fashioned sea-side towns like Saint-Marc-sur-Mer, the setting for Jacques Tati's \\"Monsieur Hulot's Holiday\\".  <br /> <br />Glynn Boyd Harte evokes this lost domain. Setting off from Wimereux, he journeys unsystematically westwards, painting madly-turreted villas, pre-war garages, their walls plastered with old advertisements, cafes with their red-checked gingham table-cloths, sea-side stalls, with rubber tyres and buckets and spades, and fishmongers' slabs covered with oysters, mussels and langoustines. He stays in elegantly faded hotels with bizarre wallpapers. The book finishes in an end-of-season sadness as the last visitors depart, the hotels are closed and shuttered and the long autumn shadows creep across the empty sands.  <br /> <br />Glynn Boyd Harte's previous books include \\"A Weekend in Dieppe\\", \\"Metro-land\\" and \\"Venice\\".	2004-11-10

FROM THE CRITICS <br />Library Journal <br />This book offers instruction on how to achieve decorative effects in home remodeling using the colors and textures of a variety of materials. These materials include paints, wallpapers, tiles, flooring, and--in the case of curtains, bedding, and other sewn accessories--fabrics. For a small-format book there is a lot of information here, much of it conveyed through color photos, drawings, and charts, all of which are tightly but creatively juxtaposed. This layout works especially well for selecting and using materials to achieve different decorative as well as functional results. Its brief hands-on descriptions of tools (ranging in this case from power saws to sewing machines) and application procedures will need supplementing by more detailed how-to manuals, in some cases.

In such \\"girlfriend groups,\\" the author claims, women can rediscover their \\"feminine soul.\\" Herron worries that women have lost \\"the motherline,\\" a group of female elders who traditionally helped initiate them into adulthood. (Herron's own mother died when she was 12, possibly influencing her concern over \\"the disruption of the fabric of female community.\\") Though Herron sometimes slips into a blanket criticism of feminism and into generalized assumptions about women's traits and desires, her group of \\"fierce beauties\\" does provide a rare model of mutual support. A young wife learns to take responsibility for her own sexuality; a middle-aged woman responds to her husband's affair; a bed-and-breakfast manager buys her own hotel; a septuagenarian has her first \\"fling\\" since her husband's death; an accountant becomes a full-time artist; a business executive travels to Africa, takes up photography and quits her job. Many such stories of female empowerment flow through Herron's nine-step program \\"to help women love and believe in themselves.\\" Complete with \\"Fierce Beauty Tips,\\" this glimpse of women's honest thoughts and feelings is part slumber party and part study of goddess/feminine archetypes. As such, it may help ease readers' sense of isolation and disrespect in society, even if it doesn't fulfill Herron's wish of spawning a plethora of new \\"girlfriend groups.\\" Agent, Tom Grady. Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.  <br /> <br /> <br />From Library Journal <br />Herron, executive director of the Gender Relations Institute and the Fatherhood Coalition, recounts thestories of a group of eight women who met for years in a Santa Barbara, CA, art studio to become \\"fierce beauties\\"--women who refuse to be victims, celebrate their bodies, and meet regularly with female friends. With more than 20 years of counseling experience, Herron knows New Age feminism and hopes to help women reconnect with their souls and form their own fierce beauty clubs. Chapters cover healing female shame, communing with the goddesses, claiming the lost part of oneself, finding one's erotic voices, discovering one's creative fire, and finding spiritual sources of love. The result is a slow read with involved sentence structures and concepts that a counselor though not necessarily a lay reader would be familiar with.

Handel is an ex-priest turned surgeon, a man whose humanity has been sacrificed to intellect. Picasso, a young woman cast out by the family that drove her to madness, is comforted only by her painting. And Sappho is the famed lesbian poet of antiquity, as alive as her immortal verse. Each is at once beguilingly symbolic and painfully real, alienated from a brutal technological world and united by Winterson's narrative, which directs them together towards a single end of satisfying inevitability. A story of lust, the unloved and loss, Art & Lies is also a jeremiad upholding the virtues of culture against the cold numbness of modern life. Erudite, impassioned, philosophical and, above all, daring, Winterson enfolds her characters in the ageless beauty of art - with a depth of feeling every bit as dazzling as her rich prose and fierce intellect.  <br /> <br />FROM THE CRITICS <br />Publisher's Weekly <br />Set on a train traveling through a dystopian future England, Winterson's latest novel is a patchwork meditation on identity and artistry. <br />_______________________________________ <br /> <br />To read Jeanette Winterson's 'Art & Lies' can and should be compared to the process of eating a glazed cream clair. It is rich, it is melancholically sweet, it is pleasurable. Conjuring, her work strikes the reader with its clarity, its lucidity, its beauty. A delicious delirium. While the plot remains in the background, the nudity of confessional tone and stylistic voice lulls you to sleep only to slap you awake in the following paragraph. The price of each paragraph is a petal, as Emily Dickinson once wrote. A remarkable poetic novel, these words should keep you up nights and days in daze.	2004-11-10

Dyer has crafted a powerful collection of writings, poems, and sayings by some of the greatest thinkers of the past twentyfive centuries. In succinct original essays, Dyer sets out to explain the meaning and context of each piece of wisdom, and, most important, how we can actively apply these teachings to our modern lives. <br /> <br />A beautiful and thoughtful gift, this book shows us a window to wisdom and a door to greatness. <br /> <br />SYNOPSIS <br />Bestselling author Wayne W. Dyer has crafted a powerful collection of writings, poems, and sayings by some of the greatest thinkers of the past twentyfive centuries. <br /> <br />FROM THE CRITICS <br />Wayne W. Dyer <br />This book is not about appreciating poetry and philosophy as much as it is about applying the wisdom of these writers to our everyday lives. All the selections in this book convey messages from sensitive, highly creative, and productive individuals who were alive here at one time, just as you and I are today.  <br /> <br />Library Journal <br />This is intended as a handbook of wisdom gleaned from 60 sources, ancient and contemporary, ranging from novelists, poets, sages, and saints to statesmen, including the likes of Herman Melville, Dorothy Parker, Shakespeare, Buddha, Jesus, Mother Teresa, and Mahatma Gandhi. Each chapter, prefaced by a quotation from an individual whose contribution to history is summed up in a few lines, revolves around a specific theme, such as forgiveness, work, family and home, divinity, individuality, and so forth. These writings are often rambling and take inspiration from individuals who have no bearing on the selected quotations. This book is self-actualization guru Dyer at his presumptuous best, capitalizing on the wisdom of others and devoting the final chapter to himself as a master worthy of the last word. Notmuch to recommend here.--Bernadette McGrath, Vancouver P.L.  <br /> <br />Kirkus Reviews <br />An enhanced version of a commonplace book, Wisdom of the Ages offers brief excerpts from the writings of 60 \\"teachers\\" (ranging from Buddha and Jesus up to George Bernard Shaw and Mother Teresa) followed by three- to four-page musings by Dyer (Real Magic) which attempt to explicate the sayings. The necessarily fragmentary nature of such an approach means that the book lends itself more to browsing than to study; the often bland and unsurprising analyses of the excerpts, and the only fitfully convincing effort to draw from each excerpt some plan of action for change and enhanced awareness would suggest that only the author's longtime fans are likely to find the volume of much interest or utility. (His fans are, of course, legion.)	2004-11-10

Fred Reichheld's national bestseller The Loyalty Effect shows why companies that ignore these skyrocketing defections face a dismal future of low growth, weak profits, and shortened life expectancy. Reichheld demonstrates the power of loyalty-based management as a highly profitable alternative to the economics of perpetual churn. He makes a powerful economic case for loyalty-and takes you through the numbers to prove it. His startling conclusion: Even a small improvement in customer retention can double profits in your company. The Loyalty Effect will change the way you think about loyalty, profits, and the nature of business. <br /> <br />Author Biography: Fred Reichheld is a Director Emeritus of Bain & Company and a Bain Fellow.
