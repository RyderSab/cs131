His work is well known, but Idle the human being has been less public. What is surprising, and gratifying, about this book is that Idle opens up and lets us inside his mind a bit. The picture that emerges is of a thoughtful, intelligent, sensitive man . The book is gently funny, but the humor arises out of his natural wit, and not the antic contrivances of a Monty Python skit. Idle also writes about the death of his mother and his close friendship with George Harrison, with an unexpected emotional openness. Recommended highly.	2005-03-14

It is a fundamentally dishonest approach to both history and biography. <br /> <br />One example will serve: As the invasion of Iraq was getting underway, \\"the press\\" became obsessed (as Sammon depicts it) with the idea that Iraq could become a quagmire. Sammon cites several examples of reporters asking various Bush administration officials whether that was a concern, and the officials airily insisting that it would not be a problem. <br /> <br />Then Bagdad fell in short order. Aha! Sammon brays! O foolish \\"press!\\" How silly you must feel now that the quagmire didn't come to pass. <br /> <br />To make this claim, of course, Sammon must ignore everything that happened after that, including a spiraling rate of U.S. casualities, the rise of insurgencies and the chaos of what Bush has recently called a \\"catastrophic success.\\" Any honest journalist would report that indeed Iraq DID become a quagmire and may remain one for some time. But that inconvenient fact, hostile to the picture Sammon wants to present, is blithely ignored in his book. <br /> <br />(Sammon always refers to \\"the press\\" as if it were a single thing, rather than hundreds of individuals). <br /> <br />This kind of creative abuse of reality is persistent throughout. I give it two stars because it is snappily written and easy to read. That is about the only thing that makes it even worth considering.	2004-09-12

The book details their early Canadian success and struggle to build an American following before the 1998 album Stunt and its breakout single &quot;One Week&quot; made them stars. It touches on band member Kevin Hearn's struggle to overcome leukemia and various marriages and births.<br />But it doesn't explore much past the surface in any aspect. This band has been through some struggles, and the brooding melancholy that lurks in their lyrics has to come from somewhere. But the book emphasizes their clever wordplay, sense of humor and superb musicianship leaving much unanswered about what personal darknesses lead to songs like &quot;When I Fall&quot; or &quot;Light Up My Room,&quot; or &quot;Break Your Heart&quot; or &quot;Pinch Me.&quot;<br />I know there are some stories to tell, because I've read some of them in interviews with the band. Myers doesn't seem interested in offering a deeper examination of these fascinating people, and the book suffers as a result. The closest he comes is when he mentions the death of one of Ed Robertson's brothers as part of the meaning of the song &quot;Leave&quot; -- the way that a premature death can haunt those left behind. But even then he mentions it in passing and deals with the whole issue in one paragraph. <br />The other major failing is that Myers is infatuated with his own cleverness, and the text is peppered with puns and efforts to incorporate song titles into sentences. These devices might bring a smile or two used sparingly, but he seems to lack both self-restraint and a good editor.<br />It's a good book, and worth reading for any fan of the band, but it isn't what it could have been.	2003-12-23

Here in America, while there is certainly a tension between government and that particular brand of fundamentalist Christians who fervently believe government should be in the business of helping them force their beliefs on everyone else, there is nothing resembling actual persecution.<br />Even the so-called \\"persecution\\" that Limbaugh describes is relatively rare. Many of his examples omit important information that would change the impression he is trying to create. (For example, he describes Jaroy Carpenter as \\"a motivational speaker,\\" and claims he was forbidden from speaking to a high school group simply because he is a Christian. What he doesn't tell you is that Carpenter is actually a fire-and-brimstone preacher who routinely uses such public speaking opportunities as proselytizing events.)<br />While Limabugh may raise a good point and a valid issue here and there, for the most part this book is a hysterical exaggeration built on half-truths.

(And for good reason ... they're accurate.)<br />I have nothing but praise for his accurate research and his analysis of the right-wing propaganda machine and the dangers it poses to honest intellectual discourse.

Facts are facts, and can't be argued with.<br />Unfortunately, the facts only rarely support Reagan-boosting, Clinton-bashing positions like Hannity's, so he misrepresents them or omits them altogether when they're inconvenient.<br />As just one example, he presents a chart cribbed from a Web site that purports to show the massive spending deficits under the Reagan administration were the fault of a Congress that spent far more money than Reagan wanted. The chart includes a \\"cumulative difference\\" column that adds up the percentage difference for the Reagan budget proposal vs. the actual expenditure year by year from 1982 through 1989. <br />Hannity claims it proves that federal spending would have been 25 percent less if Reagan's budgets had been adopted. The problem is, it doesn't work that way. Each budget is independent of the others, they are not linked to budgets from previous years. In reality, if you add up the amount Reagan proposed vs. the amount spent, the difference is only 2.8 percent. ($7.4 trillion proposed over the eight years, $7.6 trillion spent.)<br />There's another problem too: The amounts actually spent are not, as Hannity claims, the budgets that Congress approved. In fact, for at least most of the years, the amount is much closer to the proposed levels. Spending in a budget year often exceeds the amount budgeted (otherwise there would be no ability to respond to unforseen events), for reasons that are not the fault of either Congress or the White House. (In 1982 for example, Reagan proposed $695.3 billion and Congress approved $696 billion. The difference is hardly worth mentioning. But the actual amount spent that year was $745.8 billion, which Hannity incorrectly blames on Congress.)<br />That's just one example out of many. Want another? Hannity claims that after 9/11, Democrats \\"showed little interest\\" in an investigation of the intelligence failure that allowed it.Anybody who followed the news in the year or so after the attacks knows that Democrats in Congress pushed repeatedly for a commission to do just that, and the Bush administration refused for months until finally having to give in. This was documented in practically every newspaper in the country multiple times, but Hannity is banking on the likelihood that his readers didn't pay much attention or don't remember.<br />There may be good factual reasons to champion conservatism, but if that is the philosphy you want to hold, you should find better spokespersons.<br />I'm sure some people will dismiss this review as just \\"liberal bias.\\" But I'm talking about facts. Truth. Honesty. It seems to me that people who claim to be patriotic people of integrity would want to stand on truth rather than lies.	2003-08-30

As such, she can stretch the truth a bit to underscore her arguments, so I won't complain too much about her factual inaccuracies here.<br />However, the polemic fails miserably. She argues that the only possible reason a person might object to an American war is love of the enemy.<br />There is no room in Coulter's narrow world view for conscientious objection. No understanding that someone might oppose a war because the cost in American lives is too great, or because the war is morally misguided. No, in her mind, no one can oppose a war for any reason except the desire for the enemy to win.<br />Further, she argues, because some Democrats have opposed wars, all liberals are treasonous.<br />There is more, of course. She doesn't focus just on the anti-war elements, but the underlying flawed logic is always the same: any opposition to hawkish conservatism, and the policies that come with it, is motivated by love for Communists or Islamic extremists (no other possible reasons accepted) and therefore, treason.<br />This would be a satire worthy of Swift if I didn't believe Coulter believes and means every word of it. That makes it just scary. My one comfort is knowing that this book is so ridiculous and extreme that the only people who will believe its thesis are people who already believed it.<br />And yes, I did read it.	2003-08-30

Unfortunately, this book is a long series of distortions, exaggerations and outright lies.<br />Just a few examples (because a full rebuttal would be as long as the book!):<br />1. In trying to make the case that liberals and the media are elitists who don't care about the common folk, she offers this as evidence: After NASCAR racer Dale Earnhardt died, on February 18, 2001, \\"It took the New York Times two days to deem Earnhardt's death sufficently important to mention it on the first page .... The article began 'His death brought a silence to the Wal-Mart'\\"<br />Fact: The New York Times ran a front-page article on Earnhardt's death on Feb. 19, the day after he died, the earliest a morning newspaper could do so. The article begins \\"Stock car racing's greatest champ, Dale Earnhardt was killed ... \\" and goes on to desribe the accident that killed him. Coulter is completely wrong.<br />2. To support her claim that the mainsream media is controlled by not just liberals, but far-left liberals, she reports that Evan Thomas, the Washington bureau chief of Newsweek, is the son of Norman Thomas, a six-time Socialist candidate for president.<br />Fact: Evan Thomas's father is Evan Thomas Sr., who was a businessman. (He is more distantly related to Norman Thomas, but there's no evidence he shares the same political views.) Coulter got it wrong.<br />3. Coulter writes that \\"New York Times columnist Frank Rich demanded that Ashcroft stop monkeying around with Muslim terrorists and concentrate on anti-abortion extremists.\\" What Rich really did was to mildly criticize Ashcroft for refusing to meet with Planned Parenthood on the subject of abortion clinic violence. Rich said absolutely nothing about leaving Al Qaeda alone. Ann is fibbing just a bit here.<br />4. According to Coulter (four times in the course of the book), Al Gore claimed that he and Tipper were the models for the main characters in Erich Segal's \\"Love Story,\\" and Segal had denied it.<br />In fact, what Gore said was the he had read once in the Nashville newspaper that Segal himself had said that. And in fact that is true, the Nashville Tennssean had published a story in 1980 or so quoting Segal as saying that. Turned out the newspaper had misquoted Segal -- Segal had said that the male character was based partly on Gore and partly on Tommy Lee Jones, period. But all Gore ever claimed was that he had once read an article saying that, and that was true ... the article was wrong, but it had been published. <br />5. She frequently confuses (intentionally I'm sure) any words that appear in a newspaper with that newspaper's position. In mutiple cases in her book, she will write that a newspaper \\"says\\" or \\"believes\\" something, when in fact the quote turns out to be from a source in a story expressing his or her opinion, or an op-ed piece by an outside writer. This is simple lying.<br />6. She also lies with her end notes. In trying to prove that the media was friendly to Democratic Senator Robert Packwood before he was accused of sexual harassment and hostile afterward, she cites 10 quotes alternating between positive and negative, from before and after Packwood's leaving Congress in scandal.<br />Look closely though, and it turns out that all 10 quotes come from a total of only four articles ... one for four of the five negative quotes, one for the remaining negative, one for three of the positives and one more for the final two. A sampling of four stories is hardly evidence of general media trends.<br />I find it alternately amusing and frustrating that conservatives dismiss critiques like this as \\"liberal bias,\\" because I'm talking about documented facts. No matter what Ann Coulter says, the NYT did publish a page one story about Dale Earnhardt the day following his death and did not begin it with a patronizing sentence about Wal-Mart. No matter what Ann Coulter says, Newsweek's Washington bureau chief is not the son of a Socialist. No matter what Ann Coulter says, Frank Rich did not write that John Ashcroft should \\"stop monkeying around\\" with Muslim terrorists. No matter what Ann Coulter says, Al Gore did not claim he and Tipper were the models for the characters in Love Story. No matter what Ann Coulter says, a source quoted in a newspaper story is speaking for him or herself, not the newspaper.<br />This book has been deconstructed expertly time and time again, on Web sites like spinsanity.com, in books like Eric Alterman's \\"What Liberal Media?\\" and many other places. How Ann Coulter can show herself in public is beyond me.	2003-08-24
