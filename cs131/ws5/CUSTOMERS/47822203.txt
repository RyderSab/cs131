While I have read the first three books in this series, this is the one that really made me think.  When the island is inundated with mail sent to the Angels of Heavenly Daze the town is split in how to handle the requests.  Most of the people want to ignore the mail, to not worry about the problems of others, as they all have their own...Babette is worried about finances and replacing a leaky roof, Olympia is worried about losing her beloved Edmund, Georgie is worried his parents are heading towards divorce, and Birdie is worried about Capt. Salt....and so finding a way to respond to the pleas of help are met with vairous responses.  Birdie wants to send money to a family in need while others are so opposed to her plan in fear others will follow requesting handouts that can not be supplied.  Meanwhile, the true angels of the island are working behind the scenes trying to aid their charges reach conclusions that meet everyones needs.  This book removed my blinders regarding some of my own thoughts and choices.  The simple but powerful statement \\"We are the Father's hands on earth\\" made me think.  I too have budget issues, I struggle to make ends meet, but I can do things for others who may have lost or never had faith that God will provide for us.  I may smile at someone who hasn't had someone acknowledge them in a long time, or somehow encourage someone who felt alone.  And I can trust that God will provide for my needs.  I needed this reminder and am glad in the gentle stories of Heavenly Daze, I'm assured that having faith is where my future lies...	2005-08-25

Louisa forges ahead with opening her home to wounded soldiers. <br /> <br />Jesse joins a wagon train headed west guided by Wolf Torgestad, half Norwegian and half Sioux.  To gather enough supplies to be allowed to join the wagon train, Jesse had to race Ahab, hoping to win the purse of gold, but if she lost, she forfeited Ahab. <br /> <br />Louisa struggles to find her place in helping with the war effort...knitting socks and rolling bandages just doesn't seem enough....but finding the medicines to ease their suffering is...but it means going North and smuggling them back at the risk of her life. <br /> <br />I have read all three books in this series, this was my favorite...that being said, there are some big flaws in these books, the continuity is uneven and rough at times.  One page Meshach is riding Ahab, the next paragraph has Jesse riding him with no switch possible...often Ms. Snelling uses the same exact phrases over and over...as Lousia writes her letters, she invariably must blot a tear before it runs the ink, and finally after pages of minute detail you hurtle through big life changing events in two pages...maybe some more editing was needed?  But the stories are good enough to brush aside these rough spots.  I've read other books by Ms. Snelling and will look for future works...	2005-06-07

It is 1906, Sarah's children are grown, and her ranch is gripped tightly in the 3rd year of a fierce drought.  Charlie and Gil arrive home at the ranch after dropping out of college.  To Sarah, an education is worth more than gold and she can't understand why they would rather work the ranch than sit in a class room and learn. <br /> <br />Sarah's well runs dry and things are looking very grim for the survival of her cattle when her mother announces she paid a water witch to come find a new well.  Lazarus arrives on a white mule, spouting Biblical verses and sparking fear in Sarah...but he delivered and water is found...but instead of easing the struggle from the drought, more problems arise and this is only the beginning of Sarah's struggles...she faces trials that would break most people...deaths, betrayal, forces of nature that rip away at her iron will.  Sarah's nephew arrives unannounced one day demanding to become a cowboy.  Willie is the son of her brother Ernest and a \\"slatternly\\" woman he married, Lulu.  But Willie is family and Sarah takes him in.  Little does she know the pain Willie has buried so deep inside him and the tragic consequences that erupt when that pain surfaces. <br /> <br />The story is filled with the gritty reality of ranching in Arizona in the early 1900's.  The backbone of the story is as strong as Sarah herself.  This book is a fast read, filled with tension and harsh emotions...I pushed myself to finish it late in the night, because I simply couldn't put it down without knowing how Sarah would come out.  I wasn't disappointed.  This is a great adventure. <br /> <br />	2005-05-18

She will fight to survive and keep her family safe.  The book is Sarah's diary, started when she was a young girl with only a scant education.  The writing is stilted and full of misspellings...but as the years pass, Sarah grows up and through her indomitable will and thirst for knowledge her diary gains fluency along with her reading skills.   <br /> <br />Sarah's life is full of the harsh realities of the west, Indians, Mountain Men, marriages and deaths. She is fearless in the face of adversity, earning her the respect of marauding Indians. She meets the love of her life early in the story, but doesn't recognize him as her one true love until much later.  She fights to keep a deserted wagon full of books discovered on a wagon train because to her reading is the most important thing.   <br /> <br />The book is as powerful and strong as Sarah herself is.

This book is filled with the history of linen.  It is throughly documented with detailed indices. Translated from French, the details provided and pictures are glorious.  Turning the pages is a true historical lesson in how linen was created, embellished, and used during times past.  The use of lace and embroidery is stunning.  I marvel at the complexity of the designs and when I sit with my needle and thread under a magnifying glass and high powered lamp I am in awe of the early needleworkers toiling away without the assistance of these tools.  The book soothes me and transports me to another time.  This is one of my favorite books in my personal library.	2005-04-26

I love the Stephanie Plum series and truthfully expected to find Metro Girl \\"ok\\", I expected it to be just good enough to give me a fix until the next Stephanie Plum book to come out.  Well I was wrong...this book stands on its own.  Follow the exploits of Alexandra Barnaby, known as Barney to her family and friends, search Miami for her wayward younger brother, Bill turned into a fast paced romp.  Bill called Barney but their call was interrupted by a woman's scream and the line going dead.  That sets up a tale of murder and intrigue involving Castro (Castro!), missing gold, and a possible weapon of mass destruction.   <br /> <br />Barney meets up with Sam Hooker, NASCAR guy, who is searching for his missing boat that Bill appears to have \\"borrowed\\".  The chemistry between Barney and Hooker is immediate and intense.  The dialogue rips between the two characters...sexual inneundos fly back and forth and the humor is always right below the surface or actually bubbling over the top.    <br /> <br />As usual, the supporting characters are wonderful and surprising, from pistol packing cigar rolling women to evil henchman going by the name PukeFace.  The book is a fast read, perfect for the summer vacation or time spent holed up due to rainy weather.  The book is campy and fun. I recommend it to anyone wanting to laugh but still have a bit of mystery thrown in.	2005-03-29

Her family lost their own farm to a flood and now lives under the unforgiving roof of her Uncle Jacob.  He is a harsh, humourless, and unforgiving man who lost his beloved wife and twin sons to illness years before.  This results in the farm potentially being willed upon Uncle Jacob's death, to Dorethea's brother who is back east studying medicine.  So her parents work from sun up to sun down for Uncle Jacob, uncomplaining at his constant critiscim.      Uncle Jacob allows no one to get close to him, and bullies his niece into creating a quilt for him with several unusual blocks of his own design....it is only after his sudden death that Dorethea and her family discover the true meaning of the Sugar Camp Quilt.  It throws her family into danger and mystery while at the same time showing a new side to Uncle Jacob that they never knew about.    The Sugar Camp Quilt book is a wonderful story, at first I missed the familiar characters from the previous Elm Creek Quilt books, but Dorthea's story was strong enough to keep me engrossed and I finished the book quickly.  I gave it four stars only because it did not have the familiar characters in it, otherwise it would have been a 5 star review.	2005-03-15

After meeting Colin she swiftly falls in love and they marry.  Colin is all she dreamed of, romantic, dashing, and is traveling via wagon train to the wilds of Oregon.  Jordan is thrilled to be on an adventure, she slowly realizes the brutality of the long journey.  There are deaths and hardships.  She sees a side of Colin she never knew and fears what that dark side will turn into.   <br /> <br />The story introduces you to many of the families in the wagon train and when they reach Oregon they all decide to settle nearby as they feel they have become neighbors.  Colin struggles with the \\"sameness\\" of everyday and finally in desparation shocks Jordan by telling her he is returning to sea to make a large sum of money on one trip to Africa on a slaving ship.  Jordan is dismayed as she has recently given birth to their son, Michael.  Colin asks their good friend Ty Sublette to watch out over his family. Within 2 days Colin leaves her and heads off on the voyage that will take up a year.  Two years later there has been no word from Colin and it is believed he is dead.  Ty and Jordan marry and start their own family.   <br /> <br />The end of the book is too much of a rush and trying to tie up loose ends.  The faith part of the story is there, but truly is not a primary focus of the story.  I did not like how it ended at all.  For the deep turmoil that was happening, it seemed to be resolved very quickly and too neatly.  I have read several other Gilbert Morris books and while there were parts of the book I truly liked, it isn't one of his better works.	2005-02-11

These convicts, some innocent of their crimes, while others had made mistakes, must first endure a vicious trip across dangerous seas.  This book contains the evolving romances of 4 couples, all intertwined throughout the four stories.  Each story's basis is a deep Christian faith.  In the first story, John Martin was wrongly convicted of murder and sentenced to life toiling in Australia.  During the voyage, he quells a riot, but is severly punished by a jealous ships officer.  He is nursed back to health by Elizabeth.  Once arriving in Australia they strive to prove John's innocence while he struggles to trust in God's plan.    The second story revolves around Adam and Kate...Adam was also once a convict but now free and is working to create a life for himself in the Australian outback.  He takes John Martin as his assigned worker and soon learns to believe in God and agrees to try and prove John's innocence in England.  Adam meets Kate in England and together they face danger from John's true enemy.  While they struggle to return to Australia with John's proof, they fall in love.    Beth and William also travel to Australia with Kate and Adam.  William has loved Beth since they were children, married her in an arranged marriage filled with lies and secrets and as a Reverend struggles to find peace with God when he feels Beth has betrayed him.  His struggles to remain loyal to his vows and his love of God are painful but result in glorious true love.    The fourth story revolves around Tim and Patricia.  They struggle to find common ground, all the while struggling to survive in the harsh Australian Outback.  This is probably the weakest of the four stories and I think could have been left out of the book.    I found some of the stories a bit slow, but did get involved in the characters and wanted to see the conclusions of their stories.  I do wish it had moved a long just a bit faster.  But I felt you did get to truly experience the harsh conditions all who lived in Australia dealt with in the early years of the country's existence.  Particularly interesting was when the author revealed which characters in the stories were actually members of her own family.  I also liked how strongly having faith in God was woven into all the story lines.  Having a personal relationship with God does not make your life go smoothly but it does give you a solid anchor to weather the storms that all of us experience. I think that was the strong point of the book and therefore worth four stars.  Having faith in God will get all of us through life's difficulties.	2005-01-27

It helped me analyze my faith in so many ways.  I almost felt I was joining the O'Malley clan at times as I moved through each book, learning about each person in depth.  This is the final book in the series and when the previous book ended, I ached for Stephen.  His journey towards God initally took him away from his family.  As he found his way back home, he was truly finding his way home to God.   <br /> <br />While the mystery of the stolen jewels in a small town intertwined with his budding romance with Meghan moves the story along, at times I felt the stolen jewels was a bit of an annoyance that got in the the way of Stephen's story.  The mystery wasn't why I wanted to read this book.  I wanted to see how Stephen would find solace and the peace he so desperately was searching for.  Would Meg be the one to help him find God and the peace he wanted?  Would he once again be able to work as a paramedic?  Or would he turn his back on his family and life and run as hard and fast as he could?   <br /> <br />Jennifer's gift of her diary and Bible starts to give him the foundation that he needs to find his own sense of peace and calmness.  As he stakes a claim in the small town of Silverton, he slowly finds the peace he is looking for.  Of course he does this in a climax of tornadoes and a kidnapping but it seemed like the tornadoes path of destruction was much like what Stephen had felt was happening in his life.  Only after the tornado had torn through things he loved was he able to see clearly what he wanted from life and God.   <br /> <br />The O'Malleys' story is wrapped up nicely with no loose ends.  I will miss their fierce devotion and unquestioning love for each other.  But I do know I will be ready to read other Dee Henderson books.  They have all been consistently well done and I always looked forward to the next book in the series.	2005-01-12

Yes, the margins are pushed in and yes I wished for more...but I was blessed with what was there.  The story of Father Tim's Christmas was exactly what I needed.  It is a story of faith, faith in doing what you didn't imagine you could do, faith in hoping for something you never dreamed of having, and faith in the simplicity of the lives of our Mitford family.  The book is setting the stage for the end of the series where we may see the conclusion of all the loose threads, will Kenny be found, will Father Tim and Cynthia travel to Ireland, will Dooley stay a Barlowe or become a Kavanagh...these are worth waiting for, in detail and in depth.<br />To get to enjoy Christmas in Mitford makes this book worth my time to enjoy the story.

Jude did as she was told and never made a scene, even after her 7 month marriage ended in a whimper, yet in a span of under 3 months we are to believe that she turns into a passionate, fist fighting, hot blooded Irish woman not caring at all what other people think of her or her actions.  It seemed too big of a leap in a very short span of time.  Jude was always apologizing for everything she did or said and believed the best she could be was average...of course you may think the fairy prince Carrick helped her find her way in her struggle to find her place...I did like the supporting characters as well as her love interest, Aidan Gallagher...altogether I have read worse but I have also read much better!	2003-03-13

I got this book as a gift and was skeptical about it.  My daughter was born in China and I adopted her a few years ago.  The author did an excellent job capturing the day to day life of China.  The story itself was fast paced and heartwrenching.  How much &quot;truth&quot; spurred this story on is suspect and that bothers me that some people will think this &quot;really&quot; happened.  If people are reading this as a guide to international adoption it would scare everyone away.  That being said, this FICTIONAL story was grand.  Had powerful emotions and drama, it was a quick read and one I did not want to put down; but I did several times as it got too close for me.  I kept thinking what would I have done if that had been me, after having my baby girl for 5 days what would I have done if a Chinese official had requested her back?  The thought of running in a country such as China is mind boggling.  But the thrill of the chase was great and exciting.

While China is putting together the clues leading to the murderer, she also is trying to understand why her best friend Ruby has become distant and remote.  One of the things I liked best about this book was not the actual murder story (which was very good) but the subplot of Ruby's story.  The life of China is rich with multiple layers and the characters continue to grow and have added depth with each story.  I think that is what I like best about the China Bayles series, the characters continue to change and grow like all of us.	2002-06-14

Meeting Gabe's family is hard enough, but after the murder of a beautiful young singer, Tyler Brown, Benni finds herself deep in a murder mystery where her husband's best friends are all prime suspects.  She and Gabe struggle to find their footing in their marriage which seemed so right in California but under the scrutiny of his family seems ill advised.

Bennie is thrust into danger as she gets closer and closer to identifying the murderer.  Will Gabe be able to protect her?  Ms. Fowler's writing is fast paced and the story moves well.  I did think there were a few loose ends in the story but nothing that will keep me from reading the rest of the Benni Harper mysteries.  They are currently all on the top of my reading list.

If you enjoy the China Bayles series you should enjoy this series of mysteries written around the life of Benni Harper.  The characters are well written, with depth.  The mystery is involved, not easily determined.  The supporting characters delightful.  I especially liked how while the mystery is solved it is not cleanly resolved.  Life is complex and not easily tied up into a neat package with a bow.  Even though I had not read previous Bennie Harper stories, I did not feel I could not follow relationships set up in earlier stories.  I will go back and read the first books in this series...two of my favorite passages from the book...&quot;A hurt can soften you like a good, wool blanket, or, if you let it, turn you into a pile of dried leaves, ready to crumble at the first footstep.&quot; And I couldn't help but smile, being from the Texas legal community, at reading &quot;I dated an attorney from Fort Worth once.

The mystery itself was good, clues were there, but not obvious. I will read the other books in this series with enjoyment. If you are looking for an easy fast read, this is it.	2002-02-01

It is written by an 8 year old girl, Ying Ying Fry, who is adopted from China.  It is her story of going back to her orphanage in ChangSha, China to see and talk to kids in the orphange and learn about their life.  My daughter is also adopted from ChangSha so this story held even more meaning.  The words are Ying Ying's and they are powerful in her observations.  The pictures of the children and of life in general in China also fill in gaps of what her life may have been like.  This is a perfect gift for your child from China.  We will treasure it for its glimpse it gave us of life in China.  Thank you Ying Ying!	2001-10-18

It is her family's island home off the coast of Georgia, where she grew up with her brother Brian and sister Alexa.  Although Sanctuary also carries emotional burdens for Jo Ellen.  Her beloved mother disappeared 20 years ago never to be heard from again.  Her father withdrew from his family in mourning, Jo Ellen escaped the island and became a successful photographer.  Suddenly she is being stalked by someone sending her pictures of her mother, Jo Ellen realizes her mother is dead.  After suffering an emotional breakdown, Jo Ellen retreats to Sanctuary.  There she finds love after meeting Nathan Delaney, who visited the island with his family the summer of Jo Ellen's mom disappeared.  The mystery is fast paced and intriguing, the one complaint I have is there were so many characters and love stories for each of the sibilings, they sometimes felt rushed, or maybe I wanted more stories on each of the siblings...I recommend reading Sanctuary...it speeds up as the book progresses until you can't turn the pages fast enough!	2001-10-10

I was so excited about this book, I bought one for my daughter's birthday present only to find out my sister had bought one for me!  So we each have a copy of this beautiful story.  The watercolor illustrations are beautiful.  The story is wonderful about a single mom's adoption of her daughter from China.  It is my story.  I recommend this to anyone and in particular to all the single parents looking for a story that is perfect for a forever family of two.	2001-03-05

The fast paced conclusion was excellent pulling the story together, filled with horror and wonder.  I wanted the story to move faster, the first half was like slogging through mud, you can see the glorious meadow beyond but first have to plod through muck to get there.  The story involves a couple who buy their first house after living in London apartments.  They find a worn cottage in a remote village, it needs lots of restoration but they believe it will be grand.  So after purchasing it, it is fixed up, and they settle into life in the country.  They are stunned to find gardens blooming where once weeds had been, animals coming for visits, seemingly unafraid of human contact, they are somewhat dismayed to find a mysterious castle through the woods filled with &quot;Synergists&quot;.  They are warned by the village folk to stay away from the Synergists.  Slowly the leader of the group, entices Midge to explore her pain filled past.  The end is a flurry of spooky horror. What is really behind all the mysteries at the cottage, are the Synergists friends or evil foes, what happened to Flora (the previous owner of the cottage). I recommend the book, but be prepared for a slow start to a slam bang finish.	2001-03-05

The pictures are paired up with quotes from the bible as well as other sources including Robert Frost, Shakespeare, and Robert Louis Stevenson.  My favorite is The Light of Peace picture (lighthouse on the craggy cliffs, stone cottage with warm lights glowing, waves crashing and the sun setting) paired with the quote &quot;The light shines in the darkness.&quot;	2001-02-28

It has questions and space for the mom to fill in life events for her child.  It covers basic questions such as where the mother was born, grandmother and grandfather's names, things that were happening in the country when the mother was born etc.  It also goes deeper and helps the mother record memories from her life growing up and then during the time of her child.  I particularly liked it because I'm a single mom and adopted my daughter and this book works well for us.  Some &quot;baby books&quot; don't &quot;fit&quot; our family.  This one does.  I will fill it out as life goes by and someday have a hopefully treasured keepsake for my daughter.  Nice job of having Thomas Kinkade pictures sprinkled throughout the book.	2001-02-28

Lucia is an Apalachee Indian, granddaughter of Isabel, the White Sun Woman of her clan.  This story is full of the rich history of a time not well known about.  There is romance between Lucia and Carlos, as well as Charity and Isaac.  This is a tale of two families bound together by Lucia and her struggle to survive in her world which is being forced to follow Christianity as well as her struggle to survive once she is taken as a slave and ends up in Charity's household.  How will Lucia continue to serve as the White Sun Woman while living in a so called civilized world.  Will Lucia find a way to return to Carlos?  Isaac is green to the ways of the new world.  He falls in love with Charity but it is not to be, as her father wishes to solidify the families fortune by having her marry her cousin, Henry, whom Charity fears.  The richness of the story transports you to a long ago time.  It was not a fast read, sometimes slow, but I found that fit the timeframe of the story.  It was a good visit to a time I did not know much about.	2001-02-26

Delving into the lives of Father Tim and his parishoner's is the best medicine I know for relieving the day to day strain of life.  This time in Mitford, changes are happening everywhere you turn.  Father Tim and Cynthia are deciding about retirement, Buck and Pauline are faced with making life changing decisions, the town's long time Mayor is in a fight against an unscrupulous opponent in the mayoral election, and there is a mystery afoot with a Florida real estate company trying to buy several prime pieces of property.  Who is behind the real estate offerings?  Why does someone want to buy all the property? Why is Mack trying so hard to become Mayor of Mitford?  Will Dooley ever get along with Lace?  These questions are all answered as all ways as the story winds its way through the heart of Mitford and its readers.  One of my favorite things about the Mitford books is how Father Tim's faith is portrayed.  He lives his faith, everyday, with every decision.  He moves me in his efforts to be fair and kind and responsive to the many missives he handles in his duties.  Read and enjoy.	2001-02-15

The second installment of the Mitford books is refreshing yet thought provoking.  It picks up where the first book ended, with Father Tim struggling with his relationships with Dooley and Cynthia, while trying to meet all the various needs of his congregation at the same time.  I found Father Tim's anguish in trying to reach beyond his fears and deepen his romance with Cynthia realistic and probing.  Their love letters to each other reflect great courage on both their parts.  Dooley continues to exasperate and delight Father Tim as their trust in each other grows.  Reading this book is like going on a vacation...you want to savor every minute but can't wait to see what happens next!	2001-02-08

Father Tim and Cynthia are happily married, Dooley grows in both education and spirit, Miss Sadie brought me to tears and laughter, while the rest of the gang simply enchanted me.  Father Tim's happiness is almost palpable in his delight with his newly married life with Cynthia.  His courage in dealing with the daily life struggles of his congregation seems daunting at times, but through pain he finds answers and joy.  His love of God shines through him in his daily dealings with the gang at the Grill, Homeless Hobbs, and Uncle Billy.  I want to read these stories so fast for the joy they bring me but long to delay the end of my time with my new family.  These books speak to my heart.	2001-02-08

But my delight is complete with each page unfolding the lives of the people in Mitford. Father Tim is the town's priest.  Through his life we meet all the character's of the town and grow to love all of them.  Mitford is the town who takes care of their own, where the town cafe has all the news, gardens flourish, and the church is the town's social center.  The pace is relaxing, sweet, and full.  Father Tim is struggling in his own faith but yet leads his flock with unerring strength and grace.  While he frets over his human foibles, he is stretched by new relationships, first a dog, who only responds when scripture is quoted to him, then a boy, who is struggling to find love and acceptance, and finally in the neighbor who lives next door.  Father Tim and Cynthia's relationship grows in fits and spurts together.  Reading this book was like going on a vacation.  I became relaxed and refreshed chapter by chapter.  I can't wait to read on about Mitford while sipping my cup of tea.	2001-02-05
US	47822203	R3HDV1P1VBNM8D	0385316879	170822767	Journey	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Perfect for travel reading, pleasant but you will want more	The story of the awakening of Madeline Beaumont Hunter is a journey of personal growth and courage.  Madeline is the wife of Jack Hunter, handsome, rich, powerful, and poltical heavy weight.  Madeline grew up poor, married young to an abusive husband and was &quot;rescued&quot; by Jack.  Maddy grew under his tutelage into a polished, accomplished, anchorwoman in Washington.  But behind the perfect couple facade is a marriage pushed to the brink with jealousy, anger, and power.  Maddy's story is complex and unfolds bit by bit as her marriage is crumbling.  This book compares physical abuse with mental and emotional abuse well, although sometimes repetatively.  I wish Maddy would not run from one man to another man to another, but could see that on her own she is strong and valued. The topics in the book are hauntingly topical in todays society. All in all, it was a good book, just not great.	2001-01-25

The Judge is a fast read and enjoyable but realistic it is not. The main character is an attorney, Madriani, who is drawn into defending Judge Acosta in a murder trial. Madriani throughout the story breaks laws, lawyers ethical rules, and attorney client rules.  He would be disbarred in the real world.  Plus he isn't quick enough to catch a major piece of evidence that is basically dropped in his lap until the very end of the story.  The story moves quickly both in the courts and by reading.  Suspending any real world legal knowledge made it more enjoyable.  I think a little more realistic take on being a lawyer would have worked, maybe Mr. Martinin didn't have the time to figure out others ways to achieve the same end results but without destroying his main character's character.	2001-01-22

Dr. Wilson's goal in life is to prove his dead alcoholic and abusive father's relgious beliefs to be a sham.  Wil's apparent triumph sets wheels in motion that could lead to incomprehensible world wide changes and his death.  A cat and mouse game ensues with Wil trying to stay alive while seeking answers to deep secrets.  The book is a fast read with several sub-plots tossed in, including a romance.  What ever your beliefs, this book will make you think.	2001-01-11

We often read this story of how others became forever familes, and she loves looking at the pictures. I found the book to be sensitive and honest. It will be a vehicle for us to talk about her adoption in deeper levels as she gets older. I like the black and white pictures and the variety of Chinese life they capture. My daughter has a rich cultural heritage and this book will be part of it.	2001-01-11
