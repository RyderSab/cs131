US	51355211	R238VAWU6L5Z7V	0823004899	353364231	The Big Book of 5000 Fonts (and Where to Get Them)	Books	3	20	20	N	Y	Not for IDing Type Faces!	This book is done in a unique fashion and I wasn't disappointed with it. If you are simply looking for type faces, it fills the bill rather nicely. If you are trying to identify a type face, it doesn't offer enough for a comparison. Unfortunately, there are few capital letters shown so one cannot tell how the type face appears when composed in all capital letters. In a few instances, the name of the font isn't the font that is shown! Yikes! In any event, it is a helpful addition to your library since many of the type faces shown in this book can be found at no other single source.	2004-09-26

The book is well-done and presents many popular foundry type (metal) type faces. I find it valuable when comparing today's digital type fonts with the original. It displays the complete alphabet in a large size for easy comparison and recognition and includes a brief history of the type face. I feel that the book supplements other books such as \\"Encyclopedia of Type Faces\\" (Jaspert, Berry, and Johnson).	2004-09-26
