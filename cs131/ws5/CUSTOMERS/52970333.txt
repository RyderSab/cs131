It's fairly small compared to the typical game-programming tome (even with its medium-sized print), and not much less expensive.  If you went strictly by the number of words per dollar, you might overlook it.<br />If you're planning to write a 2D game with the DirectGraphics API, however, this book is exactly what you need.  There may not be a lot of words, but they're the right ones.<br />The first 40% of the book explains how to do everything you could do with 2D interfaces, and a little more.  Copying rectangles, copying non-rectangular images, and page-flipping are explained.  Added to the mix are rotation and scaling effects that were generally not possible (or at least not fast) with DirectDraw.<br />The next 40% gets into 3D engine details, explaining just enough to let you take advantage of Z-buffering, anti-aliasing, and lighting effects without needing you to be the Wizard of Polygons.  The math review is brief and to the point.<br />The last 20% is something of a waste.  A long chapter is spent learning how to parse a \\".x\\" file that contains a 3D model, something that is largely uninteresting for people whose focus is on 2D (and unnecessary for everyone else).  Another covers particle systems, which is interesting but completely out of place in this book.  One might suspect the author was padding it out a bit.  A section on text rasterization with Direct3D might have been more appropriate.<br />Overall I got exactly what I was hoping for.  The author describes the different approaches clearly, points out areas where you can get into trouble, and for the most part stays focused on the subject at hand.  The result is a book that will get you up and running with 2D under Direct3D in a few hours.	2003-07-15
US	52970333	R3P2GS0SBGVVDN	0672323699	19490560	Tricks of the Windows Game Programming Gurus (2nd Edition)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Good stuff	Game programming books are a hit-or-miss proposition.  There are some really bad ones and some really good ones.  This book falls into the latter category.<br />If you already know how to program in C, this will show you enough to get started writing Windows games.  Basic Win32 and COM stuff is covered in enough detail to let you understand what's going on without dragging on excessively.  The DirectX chapters do an excellent job of telling you what you need to do and why.<br />The game physics and AI chapters provide a strong introduction to the subject without getting bogged down in specifics that can't be generalized.  Enough math is covered (trig, vector ops) to get through most common issues.<br />There are some minor flaws.  The chapter on game physics, while good, needs some editorial work: some symbols and even a couple of formulas are missing.  The chapter on writing text adventures is completely out of place in this book.  The DirectSound chapter was strong, but glossing over 16-bit sound was a mistake.  All text output is done through the (very slow) GDI functions, so writing a replacement would have made for a logical chapter.<br />On the whole, though, this is an excellent place to start.	2003-07-10

The DirectX API has certainly changed a great deal from 6.0 to 9.0, but good game architecture doesn't change much.<br />The book was disappointing. At times it reads like a collection of disjointed articles written by an amateur programmer, and at other times it demonstrates a clear \\"been there, done that\\" presence.<br />Many aspects of the book are, simply, annoying. After briefly mentioning the Age of Empires scenario editor, the author writes in a separate note offset from the main text: \\"I worked on the scenario editor and it is largely the same as I programmed it to be, at least functionally.\\" This self-important commentary does nothing to promote anyone's understanding of game development.<br />The author's programming skills are poor. Other reviewers have said this; no need to beat it into the ground. I get the sense the author was working on tools for the games he worked on, not the games themselves. This comes out in the text: good explanations of the game development process and tools used by animators and developers, but shaky descriptions of game architecture.<br />The choice of topics is a mix of good and bad. The early chapters on planning are very good, but then we get into a very long chapter on painfully optimizing line drawing, complete with a bad clipping algorithm (\\"Actually I wrote it myself without any help.\\") The chapter ends with, \\"but also realize that there isn't much line drawing in games these days\\", calling into question the purpose of spending so much time on it.<br />It does have a long chapter on pathfinding, which was nice to see.	2003-06-30

It tells you how to do all of the typical things you'd want to do for a small business, often giving alternate approaches that are either faster or more useful that the obvious ones.<br />It has an introduction to accounting mechanics in Appendix B, but that just explains a few basic facts about double-entry accounting systems, and tells you to memorize a table of credit vs. debit effects (e.g. debits increase asset accounts and decrease liability accounts).  The book fails to explain why debits sometimes make things go up and sometimes down, something that would've been much more helpful than simple memorization.<br />I would've liked to see a chapter explaining what sorts of accounts a typical company of a specific type would set up, and how they would be used.  I like to know *why* I'm doing something as well as *how* I should do it.<br />Perhaps such things are better handled in a general book on business accounting, but a short chapter would've been enough.<br />The tone of the book is generally light-hearted.  Occasionally it gets a little thick, e.g. on page 61: &quot;Now this will be a big surprise.  (I'm just kidding.)  QuickBooks provides descriptions [...]  When you choose the command, QuickBooks displays the lost city of Atlantis.  Okay, not really.  QuickBooks actually displays [...]&quot;.  It's not usually that silly, but the author's sense of humor does pervade the book.	2002-10-10

What legal structure to choose, which agencies you need to deal with, what forms you need and where to get them, web addresses, phone numbers, and all the details.<br />It also has a wealth of information on running a business, including information on accounting, taxation, and employees.  It's well organized and easy to read.<br />The only gaps are in some of the details on forming LLCs and corporations.  The reader is referred to other Nolo books for the gritty details.  If you're forming a partnership or sole proprietorship -- probably the most common types for &quot;cottage industry&quot; -- the book is reasonably complete.	2002-08-01

However, in most cases, you create an LLC by filling the blanks in a state form, and then optionally create an Operating Agreement by filling in the blanks in a sample version included in the book.<br />The value of this book is in the state-by-state reference and in the sample Operating Agreement (and accompanying explanations).  It doesn't tell you much of anything about what else you need to do to start a business or run it, referring you to other books written by the author.<br />Given the relatively light content, I wouldn't have expected it to be on the high end price range of Nolo's offerings.  The book's real value for me was filling in some gaps in Nolo's excellent &quot;Small Business Start-Up Kit for California&quot; by Peri Pakroo.	2002-08-01
US	52970333	R1655ZSX4FMI6C	0380799154	920423724	Thunder Rift	Books	3	3	4	N	Y	Decent	Not a bad book, not a great book.  Just decent.<br />The basic idea is a ship full of soldiers and scientists exploring a nearby region of space.  The soldiers are predictably aggressive and paranoid, and the scientists are incredibly uninterested in the first contact with an alien culture.  (Once they determine that an intelligent species isn't the one they were looking for, they all totally lose interest.  Hello?)<br />Unlike many reviewers, I didn't find the &quot;blues&quot; especially different from humans.  The author tried very hard to make them different, but they're no more alien than the folks in an ethnically different part of town.<br />The book tries to surprise you by setting things up one way and then having them turn out to be something very different.  The set up is so clumsy that the end is revealed at the beginning.  (Assertions made about a certain phenomenon come to mind.)<br />The plot progressed well, and the main character was well developed.  An interesting read, but not a very deep one.	2002-04-30

Most of the book is preparation for or execution of battle against the Posleen, an enemy with a low IQ and a large appetite.<br />The plot and action scenes were well done, and for the most part it felt very \\"real\\".  I got quite wrapped up in the story.<br />Occasionally things would knock me back out of the story.  The graphic depictions of what happens when you introduce high-velocity projectiles to the inside of a well-armored suit were crude and unnecessary.  (If you're going to document the revolting parts, that's fine, but kindly remove references to spaghetti.  Thanks.)  There were several reverential references to military SF authors (one by name) that were out of place and silly.  Praising the people you admire is all well and good, but turning them into the salvation of humanity is stretching it.<br />There were political issues that came and went with no apparent effect on the outcome of the story.  Perhaps they will factor into the sequel?<br />There were \\"major\\" threads and \\"minor\\" threads, the latter distinguished from the major only by the speed with which the pertinent characters met their demise.  The story had a lot of recurring faces on parallel plot lines, but switched between them haphazardly, as if the author got tired of telling us about the recon squad for a while and decided to come back to it some other day.<br />What is at fault, I think, is less the writing and more the editing.  The author has a tremendous talent that isn't well honed in this novel.  When he finally gets down to business for the last half of the book, though, the result is captivating.	2002-04-04

I liked it, but it doesn't compare well to the previous two.<br />Smith seems to be developing a pattern to the plot in his novels.  Lots of mystery, interrupted by the occasional talking applicance, followed by some weird reality-bending concepts toward the end of the book.  One of Us has a more intricate plot than the previous novels, and a more solid grounding in conventional reality, but I would have liked to see him break out of the mold entirely.<br />The characters seemed somehow less alive.  The ruminations of the protagonist lacked a certain something.<br />The book is considerably less gory than his earlier works; whether that's an improvement is a matter of taste.<br />I've come to view this book as Smith &quot;lite&quot;.  It's an easier introduction to his writing than, say, Spares, but it just feels like there's something missing.<br />I should finish by pointing out that, although this review is generally negative, it's only so because I loved his earlier works so much more.	2002-03-10

It certainly held my attention for a long stretch.<br />That, I think, is what's best about Wizard's First Rule.  It's long, it's engrossing, and unlike Jordan's books, it actually has an end at the end.<br />What annoyed me about this was the occasional bouts of self-importance.  Every once in a while the author would try to be clever or deep, and the attempt would fall completely flat.  Being profound is all well and good, but you actually have to *be* profound, not rattle off some zen-sounding phrase and hope everybody will soak it up.<br />I think I would have enjoyed this more if I'd let that sort of thing slip past.  You can destroy a rock with magic but can't destroy a beard?  Fine.  You can cause intense pain with magic when you touch somebody, but can't stop an organ from functioning?  Okay.<br />If you accept the book for what it is -- a long, fantastic journey through strange places, populated by some genuinely nasty people (who tend to get what they have coming to them in satisfying ways) -- it's really quite entertaining.	2001-11-04

I enjoyed it thoroughly.<br />It started off as a hard-boiled, hard-sci-fi action novel with some odd characters and unusual scenery.  It turned into a remarkably imaginative romp through strange places and stranger plot twists.  The exploration of the protagonist's psyche and background was much deeper than similar books in this genre -- the section after he's Gone Away stands out in particular.<br />The only thing that bugged me was the incessant &quot;___ was like ___&quot;.  Too many things were described in terms of other things; the language pattern started to wear on me.<br />If you don't like strong language and the occasional blood &amp; guts, you don't want to read this.  If you don't mind, this is a great read.	2001-11-04

Simply the best book there is for genetically average, non-chemically-enhanced trainees.<br />A comment on a prior review: the book does not insist that any exercise not described in the book is unsafe.  Rather, it states that exercises were omitted either because they were unsafe under all conditions, unsafe without a trainer, or were reundant with better ones.  Excellent lifts, such as cleans, were omitted because doing them without a lifting coach is a dangerous prospect.	2001-08-19

The Elfstones of Shannara is a marvelous epic that shouldn't be  missed.<br />Everything from the depth of the characters to the descriptions  of the heroic battle with Demons is wonderfully done.  Battles without and  within must be fought, and worthy adversaries must be overcome.

I'm glad I didn't; the last third of the book made it all worthwhile.<br />The story, as a whole, is well written.  The author has a way of poking fun at certain character traits  that works rather well.  Where I ran afoul of her style is with the way  that, for most of the middle of the book, the characters are always on the  verge of figuring things out.<br />This sort of drawn-out, pained suspense  annoyed me to the point where I wanted to reach into the novel, grab  certain characters, and shake them vigorously.  It's somewhat frustrating  to find that, 200 pages later, a fundamental question that was *almost*  answered earlier is still *almost* answered now.<br />Some people have  commented that you could skip about 200 pages in the middle and hardly miss  a beat in the plot.  They're correct.  However, you would also miss out on  some clever dialog, and you'd never get to know certain characters in a way  that makes the final hundred pages so poignant.	1999-09-07

This is the first Neil Gaiman book I've read; in fact, the first I'd ever heard of him was when a local PBS station broadcast the Neverwhere mini-series.<br />Gaiman does an amazing job of  presenting a bizarre, frightening world from the perspective of a rather  ordinary fellow who wants little more than to be perfectly ordinary.  The  book manages to be clever, funny, and eerily unsettling all at once.<br />If  you enjoy science fiction narrated with a clever tongue, you MUST read this  book.	1999-03-27

But that's not what it's about.<br />What it's about is teaching you which behaviors are  constructive and which aren't.  By avoiding specific actions, you can avoid  irritating co-workers, customers, and people you meet every day.  If you  change your approach from the confrontational to the constructive, you can  be much more pleasant to be around.<br />At its heart, that's what the book is  all about: if you're a pleasant person to be around, other people will like  you.  It's not so much about manipulating others as it is controlling  negative impulses in your own personality.<br />There's nothing in here that  you couldn't learn by interacting with people on a daily basis, and  studying their responses.  People who are good at dealing with others --  even in difficult situations, like reprimanding someone who works for them  -- have an intuitive understanding of the lessons in this book.  If you  really pay attention to how others react to the things you do and say, you  will soon discover what sets other people off.<br />Rather than spend half  your life figuring this stuff out, why not buy the book and see what's  there?  It's light reading, with lots of analogies to back up the  interesting points.	1999-03-02

He took a number of concepts and creatures from the Known Space  genre (there's a collection called &quot;Neutron Star&quot; with some short  fiction in the same area) and combined them into a wild adventure on a  mysterious world.<br />Ringworld is a memorable place, and it's well worth  reading about.	1999-02-18

Niven is way out in  left field (witness Ringworld), Pournelle is firmly rooted, and when you  put them together you get something in between. &quot;Mote&quot; got the  two of them in just the right spot.<br />The book is fascinating all the way  through.

After all is said and done, I know a lot more random facts about Japanese and Arabic culture, the fundamentals  of psychology, astrophysics, biology, and materials science; but I can't  say I really enjoyed the book much.<br />The trouble for me was that I look to  science fiction as an escape from reality, not the written form of a  documentary on the Discovery channel.  If you're looking for lots of  &quot;hard&quot; science, or enjoy fiction that's long on characters and  short on action, then this book will suit you well.  I just couldn't get  excited reading about somebody wandering around in his rover, going from  camp to camp and having philosophical discussions about the role of women  in Bedouin culture.<br />Things do start to pick up around 500 pages in, but  in a book with slightly under 600 pages that's not quite soon enough for  me.	1999-01-03

As it turns out, that's because it was printed on heavy stock, in large type, and contains a lot of material that could be omitted.<br />The book assumes you're already familiar with Windows programming and MFC -- I wasn't familiar with either, and so felt this acutely -- yet the author felt compelled to provide details like how to select more than one file at a time from the standard file dialog.  Particularly in the early chapters, you spend half the time learning something interesting, and half the time wondering whether the author had a page quota.<br />I would be more willing to recommend this book if it had taken the form of a manual, and provided comprehensive coverage rather than selecting a few topics and casually walking through them.  I would also have liked to see more recommendations on how to go about creating and maintaining source code and associated resource files. !  The author intersperses comments like, &quot;if you change something here, you will have to go back and clean up the other stuff over here&quot;.  Had that taken the form of a checklist, instead of casual commentary sprinkled throughout the book, it might have proven more useful.<br />There *are* useful pieces of information here, about features you might not otherwise notice, but this book falls short of providing a comprehensive manual or a useful &quot;how to&quot; guide.	1998-07-20

While this book will help you  become a smarter investor, the goal isn't so   much to convince you that certain methods of   picking securities are superior to others as it is to   provide a solid education in financial market   theory.   <br />   It's a long book, and written with an academic   style that some people will find dry and boring,   but Malkiel successfully avoids turning it into   a textbook.  He manages to present a wealth of   information about *why* markets behave the way   they do without getting bogged down in the math.   <br />   If you've read some of the other books on   investing, and are interested enough to want   to look deeper behind the scenes, this book   is well worth your time.	1997-09-21

Some of the stories there (&quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;,   which bears little resemblance to the awful   movie, and &quot;Burning Chrome&quot;) should be considered   prerequisites if you don't want to be confused   by some of the terminology and oblique historical   references.   <br />   I can understand why some readers got turned   off.  You're dropped into a foreign world and   expected to understand what terms mean from   context, but even the context is foreign.  If   you find yourself getting frustrated after the   first couple of chapters, read _Burning Chrome_   first, then go back and give it another try.  The   short story collection has some real gems in it,   and if you enjoyed _Neuromancer_ it's definitely   worth your time.   <br />   I thought _Neuromancer_ was an *excellent* book.	1997-08-29

Fortunately, his prattling<br /> is interesting, entertaining, and laden with<br /> good advice for the potential investor.<br /><br /> The book covers a range of personal finance<br /> and investment topics, and is filled with<br /> interesting anecdotes that drive his points home.<br /> While not as complete a guide as &quot;Personal<br /> Finance for Dummies&quot;, it goes into<br /> slightly more depth on some investment subjects,<br /> and the informal structure may appeal to those<br /> turned off by guides that resemble textbooks.	1997-08-28

From the title alone, I wouldn't have bought this  book.  I mean, who wants a personal finance book  that's intended for a dummy?  I was saving money,   I owned mutual funds that were doing well, no   credit card debt -- all the things that you're   supposed to do, I was doing.   <br />   I was surprised at how much I learned from this   book.  Rather than focus on investments alone   (which *are* covered, and in a much plainer and   more accessible way than something like Andrew   Tobias' &quot;Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need&quot;),   it looks at every aspect of your financial life.   <br />   Do you understand life insurance?  The ins and   outs of home loans?  Think options trading will   make money?  What about market timing   newsletters?  Does paying other people to manage your money make sense?  Which professions are   more interested in the commissions they get than   your interests, and what should you do to avoid   them?  Should you divert 401(k) money   into a custodial account for your kids?  If   you're saving up to buy a house in another two   years, should that money be invested in the   stock market?  Sometimes there are simple   answers, but many times the answer is that it   depends on who you are, how you like to live,   and where you want to be in 30 or 40 years.   Rather than tell you how you should be living   your life, Tyson asks you to decide what is   best for *you*, and suggests how to get there.   <br />   It's split cleanly into sections that stand   by themselves, and written in a style that can   be comprehended by a dummy, but isn't   &quot;dumbed down&quot; or condescending.  The purpose   of the book is to show you how to maintain   control of your life and avoid getting ripped   off by the multitude of self-interested   &quot;consultants&quot;.   <br />   The first dime anybody invests should be in   this book.	1997-08-27
