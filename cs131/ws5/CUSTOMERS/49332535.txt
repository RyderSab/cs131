James and her prolific detective Adam Dalgliesh, I was a little hesitant to stray from that series into the first one devoted to Cordelia Gray.  Yet \\"An Unsuitable Job for a Woman\\" is a richly rewarding read, with the classic elements that mark James' writing and a mystery as twisted as anything that Dalgliesh would find himself up against (and the fact that he makes an appearance later in the book is a boon).  James went out on a limb crafting a new detective, a young female one at that, but succeeds in establishing Cordelia Gray in easy company with her more reknowned detective.<br /><br />\\"An Unsuitable Job for a Woman\\" introduces readers to Cordelia Gray, a twenty-two year old private investigator who has just inherited the entire investigation buisness from her partner after his suicide.  She finds herself at odds with how to make ends meet, when a case is thrown her way that was originally intended for her partner.  Cordelia makes her way to Cambridge, at the request of the famous scientist Ronald Callender.  He is at a loss to explain the suicide of his young son and hires Cordelia to find out why his son killed himself.  As soon as Cordelia starts searching and asking questions regarding the young heir's death, she finds herself convinced that the case is one of murder, not suicide, and that her own life may be at risk.<br /><br />Cordelia Gray has her work cut out for her.  Secrets abound everywhere, and she must make her way in a 'man's world' to uncover the truth behind the mystery.  The writing is surprisingly fast-paced for a novel that is introducting a new character, but James throws in the necessary information about her new sleuth as the novel progresses.  It is told in natural flashbacks through Cordelia's thoughts on the case at hand.  I look forward to reading the other Cordelia Gray mystery and am sure I will find myself wishing there were more.	2005-10-10

Waugh is famous for his scathing satire and witty play with words; he can craft characters who are odious even to him and dispose of their problems with ease and brillance.  Such is the case with \\"The Loved One\\", a wry novel that skewers everything from the upper class to religion to funerary practices, all while drawing laughs and smiles from the reader.<br /><br />Dennis Barlow is a young Englishman living in southern California.  He fashions himself to be a poet, but as the Muse has left him dry, he finds employment at the Happier Hunting Grounds a.k.a. the local pet cemetery.  When his mentor and roommate commits suicide, it is up to Dennis to arrange his funeral at the chic and studied Whispering Glades - not so much a cemetery as an entire business devoted to the dead and their 'waiting ones'.  Dennis finds himself enthralled with not only Whispering Glades, but with Aimee, a young cosmetician who works there.  He fights for her attention with plagarized poems while her other suitor, Mr. Joyboy the wonder mortician, delivers smiling corpse after corpse for her to paint in hopes of winning her love.<br /><br />After introducing readers to this integral triangle of the book, the novel is then devoted to Aimee's struggles to choose which man she should marry.  This questioning leads to some fatal consequences, that are indecorously disposed of through Waugh's irreverent creation Dennis Barlow.  \\"The Loved One\\" is tirelessly funny, and searchingly honest.  Evelyn Waugh examines the farce humans play when a loved one dies with heretofore unknown wit and alacrity that may have failed under lesser hands.	2005-10-10

James.  She is a first class writer who weaves her mysteries full of plot twists while developing her detective Adam Dalgliesh book after book.  Even though the books fit into an ordered series, she doesn't spend needless time rehashing events in Dalgliesh's life, but allows<br /><br />her readers to grow with him.  \\"Unnatural Causes\\" finds Dalgliesh hoping to take a vacation at his aunt's house in Suffolk; needless to say, he finds himself enmeshed in a murder investigation that might perhaps hit too close to home.<br /><br />When writer Maurice Seton is found dead in a boat, floating at sea, his hands chopped off, the community of writers is instantly on alert and under investigation.  His death had to come at the hands of one of the people in this small, closely knit town, but the post mortem shows that Seton died of natural<br /><br />causes.  Dalgliesh isn't convinced, and despite his wish to remain aloof, he involves himself in the search for the truth behind the writer's death.  He must work his way through seemingly unbreakable alibis and preconceived prejudices.<br /><br />\\"Unnatural Causes\\" is a quick-paced mystery, but the ending fails in comparison to others in the series.  Usually P.D. James invites the readers into the thoughts and reactions of the both the killer and those affected by the crimes; however, this novel is summed up with a taped confession that doesn't allow the readers to enter in.  I found it ironic that Dalgliesh lambasts detective fiction at one point for wrapping cases up too tidily with not enough clues to point one to the real killer.  This was the first time I have read a James' mystery where I knew who the killer was, just by instinct, but could not figure out the motive; perhaps if I look back, the clues will be there, as they usually are.	2005-10-06

He desperately tries to pass his memories onto his son so that they will never die, even if he does.<br /><br />\\"The Forgotten\\", like most of Wiesel's books, weaves back and forth through time and between different narrators.  At times the transitions between these various changes is a little choppy, but the stories all interconnect in the end.  Elhanan's son, Malkiel, struggles with the task his father has assigned him.  He cannot fathom how he is to possibly hold and retain his father's memories along with his own.  And when his father asks him to take a pilgrimage to his hometown, both are unsure as to what to look for, but know that an answer must exist there that will free Elhanan's painful memories and grant him peace.<br /><br />Wiesel has devoted his life to searching for meaning in what has happened to the Jewish people.  As a survivor of the Holocaust, he has a tremendous witness to bear.  That aspect of being a witness plays a large role in \\"The Forgotten\\".  As Malkiel finally realizes, he must do what his father no longer can.  \\"I will bear witness in his place; I will speak for him.  It is the son's duty not to let his father die.\\"  And it is the duty of the world not to let the past slip into oblivion.  Lest we forget.	2005-10-01

When Sally is found dead after her car goes over a cliff, questions of sucide arise.  And readers are left to wander through the lives of people closest to Sally as they offer insight and questions about her death.<br /><br />Rotating between four perspectives, Beeman weaves a short tale filled with an often stunning and lyrical mood, that ultimately falls flat and ineffectual.  Sally's life is woven among that of her sister Mattie, Mattie's husband Evan, Sally's lover Joel, and Joel's soon-to-be-ex-wife (unless he can change her mind) Anna.  Beeman devotes too much time to the inconsequential aspects of these characters' lives, instead of focusing on the story at hand.<br /><br />While the changes in perspective is an interesting route to uncover any mystery, too little is devoted to what drew readers into the book in the first place.  Yes, the reader is given various skewed insights into Sally's life and her possible motives for ending her life (if it was suicide), but one must read through the lives of one-dimensional characters who are too cliched to be real.  Beeman's writing is strongest when describing the setting, rather than developing the characters.	2005-10-01

They have never seen the girl in their life; how could she have wound up murdered in their house?  Mrs. Bantry calls in her good friend Miss Marple to search out the truth that several detectives cannot find, and bring the murderer to justice before he kills again.<br /><br />Miss Marple is just as puzzled as the Bantrys as to why the blonde was found in their house.  The victim, Ruby Keene, was a dancer at the local hotel and had fallen into the affection of a hotel visitor, the wealthy and crippled Conway Jefferson.  His son-in-law and daughter-in-law definitely had means to murder Ruby, but their alibis are solid.  And the other suspicious characters without alibis, have no motives for the killing.  Miss Marple has her work cut out for her, but as usual, she rises to the challenge and surpasses the efforts of the local constable and a retired Scotland Yard detective.<br /><br />\\"The Body in the Library\\" is a quick-paced, witty mystery.  Agatha Christie uses several cliches in wonderful and clever plot twists as the mystery surrounding the murder begins to unravel.  The ending seems a little rushed, and there are often too many detectives looking into the case, which is perhaps why Miss Marple outwits them all.	2005-09-24

The topic matter of this novel might seem like strange territory for the Steinbeck of \\"Cannery Row\\" or \\"Of Mice and Men\\", but is filled with his trademark depictions of men who have been broken by life trying to find their way.  This time the novel focuses on Joseph Wayne and his family as they try to eek out a living in the valley of Nuestra Senora in California.<br /><br />Joseph Wayne leaves his family and dying father in Vermont to fulfill his dreams of owning his own land in the vast unknown country.  After he has established his farm, he receives news that his father has passed away, and his brothers shortly come to live with him at his ranch.  The Wayne family experiences every prosperity the land has to offer and happiness settles on them; however, Joseph believes that this prosperity is due to the spirit of his father who resides in the great oak tree he built his house next too.  He daily offers news and sacrifices (of a sort) to the tree as a way of thanksgiving.  This worries his devoutly Christian brother Burton, who eventually destroys the tree when he leaves the ranch.  As soon as the tree is destroyed and dying, disaster settles upon the ranch and the Wayne family.<br /><br />After the disaster strikes, Steinbeck takes readers along on Joseph's quest as he madly searches for the meaning behind the dying land and a way to bring it back to life.  In his search, he means to leave no stone unturned, no matter what the sacrifice.  \\"To a God Unknown\\" is a compelling examination of man's fate and beliefs.  The story is beautifully told with vivdly poetic descriptions of the land.  And yet the characters seem to lack some luster, some thread of reality.  While some may mark that up to the story being a fable, a vast quantity of the dialogue rings untrue and leaves the characters flatly, one-dimensional.  The story is strongest when the author isn't forcing his characters to confess things to move the story along, when it's allowed to unfold with the enviable grace that infuses all of Steinbeck's greatest works.st when the author isn't forcing his characters to confess things to move the story along, when it's allowed to unfold with the enviable grace that infuses all of Steinbeck's greatest works.	2005-09-23

This is the case with \\"Murder Is Easy\\", which follows the retired policeman Luke Fitzwilliam through his trials to piece together a string of deaths that may or may not be murder.  Christie's novel is well thought out, plentiful in red herrings, and a quick, enjoyable mystery.<br /><br />Traveling into London by train, Luke Fitzwilliam finds himself stuck in a compartment with Miss Fullerton, a supposedly dotty old maid who instantly tells him about life in her quaint little village of Wychwood.  Except that Wychwood isn't all it's cracked up to be; Miss Fullerton is certain there's a murderer on the loose and is on her way to Scotland Yard to tell them.  Luke humors her and would likely forget her story, except that he discovers she was run over by a car on her way to Scotland Yard, and the man she fingered as the next victim of the murderer, suddenly dies a short time later.  Now Luke is convinced that Miss Fullerton's suspicions were correct, and he sets off to Wychwood to uncover the mystery for himself.<br /><br />As soon as Luke is in the village, he sets out to discover who the murderer might be, compiling lists of suspects and motives, along with any possible connections between the victims.  It is a daunting task, especially when it must be done under a false cover, but the villagers are more than willing to help out.  And when the murderer strikes again while Luke's in town, all certainties are thrown out the window as he tries to uncover the unlikely murderer.  \\"Murder Is Easy\\" is a quick-paced read, that draws the reader into the story.  I wasn't fooled by all the red herrings, as Luke tended to be, so I wasn't surprised by the ending.  All in all, even if one figures out the mystery before the author takes one there, the book is still a pleasant escape into the world of one of the best mystery writers.one of the best mystery writers.	2005-09-17

As a fan of many Victorian novelists, I was curious what so-called secrets and mysteries Daniel Pool would uncover.  \\"Dickens' Fur Coat and Charlotte's Unanswered Letters\\" may not be an appropriate title since Pool covers much more ground than just these two authors; he examines the rise of the novel in England during the nineteenth century with great care and thoroughness.<br /><br />While Pool does focus a great amount of time on the writings of Dickens and Charlotte Bronte (and briefly on her sisters) this book is not just a mere examination of authors.  Mixed in with the mini-biography, and gossip-page fodder scandals these authors created, is the detailed explanation of the popularity of the novel.  Pool iterates the progress novels made from three-decker behemoths to readily available cheap one-volume novels.  Another way that the popularity of novels expanded in England was due to serialization; the publishing of novels in installments in literary magazines made these stories available to a wider audience in an age when novels could only be accorded as a luxury to the richest society members.<br /><br />Throughout the course of the book, readers are treated to mini-biographical sketches of writers such as Trollope, Thackerary, Hardy, Henry James, and George Eliot.  These sketches are intermingled with almost too much information at times and the book is supplemented with numerous pictures.  At times it seems as if Pool is trying to cram too much information into too little space; and sometimes it seems as if the same information is being repeated with no overall plan as to the direction of his writing.  However, \\"Dickens' Fur Coat and Charlotte's Unanswered Letters\\" is a delightful read for any fan of Victorian novelists, or novels and the rise of literature in general.	2005-09-15

Austen devotes little time to Jane Fairfax, the young woman destined to be a governess who forms a secret engagement to Frank Churchill; but Joan Aiken takes readers into the background of this fictional character, from youth to marriage, with generally pleasant but uneven storytelling.<br /><br />In \\"Jane Fairfax\\" we are introduced to a young Jane of about six years old.  Destined to befriend the rich Emma Woodhouse, Jane dreams of a close relationship, but these are dashed by Emma's snobbish and superior attitude.  Jane is taken to live with the Campbells, friends of her deceased father, and is brought up as their second daughter, enjoying a sisterly relationship with Rachel Campbell.  It is through the Campbells that she first encounters Frank Churchill and agrees to a secret engagement before she makes her return to Highbury; this proves difficult for Jane who is now unaccustomed to the ways of Highbury, how every word and action are watched and nothing remains secret for long.<br /><br />Joan Aiken doesn't quite deliver on the premise of \\"Jane Fairfax\\".  While she does an admirable job of fleshing out Jane's early life and her inner thoughts, the pace is uneven.  Lengthy amounts of narrative are devoted to frivilous stories while her attachment with Frank and the denouement of the book happen at a lightning speed.  She spends a good section of the book on Jane's childhood, but quickly passes over five years in two paragraphs.  There even seemed to be a four page spell when Mr. Knightley was narrating the story rather than Jane.  I enjoyed the book since I love the characters Jane Austen created in \\"Emma\\", but by no means should this be considered the definitive look into the life of Jane Fairfax.	2005-09-08

For much of his life, he was an agnostic, eventually coming to accept Christianity not through any miraculous transformation, but through rational thinking.  He was a confirmed bachelor, but wound up marrying late in life, to the American divorcee Joy Davidman, his perfect counterpart in almost every manner.  His life was awakened by Joy's presence, but their brief marriage (just nearly four years) was terminated when Joy died of cancer.  C.S. Lewis kept track of his thoughts and ramblings after this event in a series of notebooks that became \\"A Grief Observed\\".<br /><br />\\"A Grief Observed\\" is at times almost too personal.  Lewis leaves nothing hidden, allowing readers access to his anger and his questioning of God.  He claims that these are not all his thoughts, merely 'one in a hundred', that he has recorded as he tries to sort through his sorrow and grief.  He likens his pain to various metaphors, including that of an amputee who still feels the pain of the lost limb - for Lewis, his lost wife who was part of him.  He finds that it is always easy to offer comfort to those who have lost loved ones, to even pray for them, when they are not our loved ones.<br /><br />He questions God at every turn, eventually finding his way back to faith, seeing this challenge as a test of his faith and love.  \\"God has not been trying an experiment on my faith or love in order to find out their quality.  He knew it already.  It was I who didn't.  In this trial He makes us occupy the dock, the witness box, and the bench all at once.  He always knew that my temple was a house of cards.  His only way of making me realize the fact was to knock it down.\\"<br /><br />\\"A Grief Observed\\" is a short book, under one hundred pages, filled out with an afterword that is a brief biographical sketch on Lewis by Chad Walsh, an English professor and friend of Joy Davidman.  It is a fitting close to Lewis' thoughts, to take a brief look at his life from a man who knew both husband and wife.  For someone of such legendary status as Lewis in the academic and literary worlds, it is a unique experience to see his weaknesses.  Lewis acknowledges that there is no map that one can make of sorrow, for it is a process that everyone must go through, and it is reaffirming in faith to travel alongside him through his grief.at his life from a man who knew both husband and wife.

I wondered if Erik Larson had a hard time selling the concept of a book that juxtaposed the 1893 World's Fair with the murderous path of a serial killer.  But his book has crossed all lines and interested a variety of readers - and for good reason.  \\"The Devil in the White City\\" defies classification; it is enticing and well-researched, and oftentimes reads more like a novel than non-fiction.<br /><br />\\"The Devil in the White City\\" is the tale of two men - one who was devoted to improving architecture and his beloved city of Chicago and the other who was bent on using people for his own malicious ends.  The architect, Daniel Burnham, had the unadmirable job of organizing the Chicago's World Fair in little less than two years.  The murderer Henry H. Holmes, took advantage of the fair's presence in Chicago to organize a ring of fraud and murder, hoping to lure young, unchaperoned women into his web through his so-called 'World's Fair Hotel' just west of the fairgrounds.  Author Erik Larson effectively builds suspense around both stories by weaving between the two, and including anecdotes about real-life characters like Buffalo Bill, Thomas Edison, and Theodore Dreiser.<br /><br />The main story is that of Burnham and his struggle to bring the dream of the 'White City' to Chicago.  Arguments and disaster filled the entire process of organizing the fair, everyone hoping to achieve a greater success than that of Paris' preceding fair.  With so many skeptics assured all plans will fail, and the country on the brink of financial devastation, spending money on a temporary fair was a risky investment, but Burnham and numerous others rose to the task.  Burnham's story is fleshed out by that of H.H. Holmes, a diabolic young man who used his good looks and medicinal skills to lure countless young women into his trap.  Following the killer's trail proved difficult for detectives who could not imagine that a man could be so malicious to men, women and even children, and it is unknown today exactly how many people Holmes murdered.<br /><br />It is amazing to think of all the invetions and inovations that debuted at the World's Columbian Exposition - Shredded Wheat, Juicy Fruit gum, the Ferris Wheel.  But it seems even more amazing that so many did not know this story already; it has fallen from our minds as quickly as the buildings of the 'White City' were demolished after the fair.  Erik Larson has done a tremendous job in recreating the dream that was the 1893 World's Fair and done superb justice to the tales of two very different men, both of whom felt like kings of Chicago, if only for a little while.fficult for detectives who could not imagine that a man could be so malicious to men, women and even children, and it is unknown today exactly how many people Holmes murdered. <br /> <br />It is amazing to think of all the invetions and inovations that debuted at the World's Columbian Exposition - Shredded Wheat, Juicy Fruit gum, the Ferris Wheel.

James has crafted a fine mystery with \\"Original Sin\\".  Set at Peverell Press, the oldest publishing house in Britain, the novel follows Commander Adam Dalgliesh and his team as they weave their way through suicide, murder, and practical jokes to uncover the truth behind this mystery.  \\"Original Sin\\" is slightly longer than other mysteries in the Dalgliesh series, but it is quick-paced with plenty of twists thrown in to keep the reader off track.<br /><br />Peverell Press is in trouble - their place of business, Innocent House (a grand reproduction of a Venetian palace) eats up more money in upkeep than the firm makes in business; ever since Gerard Etienne has taken over as director there have been a string of practical jokes that have gone unsolved; and when Gerard Etienne is killed, it is certain that more murders are on their way.  \\"Original Sin\\"  fluctuates between different narrators, allowing the reader to enter into the mindset of all of the characters involved - from the senior executives to the lowliest temp.  Nearly everyone has a motive for murder as few were fond of the directions that Gerard Etienne had planned for Peverell Press.  It is up to Commander Dalgliesh and his investigation team, including Inspector Kate Miskin, who must unravel each fact from each fiction as the stories surrounding the publishing house grow more twisted as the investigation continues.<br /><br />\\"Original Sin\\" is a quick read, the characters are vividly written, and the novel harks back to an earlier era of substance over flash.  The conclusion of the novel happens a little too quickly, but the roots for the murders stretch back through history, and questions of morality and justice arise.  Ultimately the conclusion comes down the a sense of absolution - a forgiveness (or lack thereof) of past sins and sins that are passed from father to son.  \\"Original Sin\\" is a brilliant examination of justice and morality.	2005-08-28

His first memoir chronicled the military experiences of both his father and grandfather, and the time that McCain spent in Vietnam as a prisoner of war.  While that status has helped him in his political career, McCain has never used the term 'hero' to define who he is.  In \\"Worth the Fighting For\\" he chronicles his career in politics, interspersing his recollections with portraits of men he has admired and whom he considers heroes.<br /><br />After ending his Navy career, John McCain moved to Arizona and began his assent in the political arena.  He moved up the ranks to state senator and has served in that capacity for twenty plus years.  His writing is candid and often almost too honest for a man still practicing politics as he recounts fights over legislation and his run for the presidential nomination.  But John McCain is about laying every card on the table.  He doesn't hide anything and he never shirks from anything - even if it means fighting for an issue that goes against the Republican party politics.  McCain seems to be one of the rare politicians who can put partisianship aside and truly work for what is best for America and the American people.  He acknowledges his triumphs, as well as his failures, painting a portrait of a man who has spent his life in service to the country he loves.<br /><br />An interesting blend of memoir and political science, McCain has crafted a read that extends beyond party lines.  Whatever your political preference, you can admire John McCain for what he has achieved throughout his life.  The title \\"Worth the Fighting For\\" is an apt description of McCain's naval and political career, but it more importantly applies to what is at stake in American politics today.  For the government to truly serve the nation, there needs to be less fighting between the two main parties.  And for Americans not in government to make a difference, they need to be active citizens who realize that democracy and freedom are things that are worth fighting for, (even when they come at a high price).t to make a difference, they need to be active citizens who realize that democracy and freedom are things that are worth fighting for, (even when they come at a high price).	2005-08-25

Ever since reading \\"Much Ado About Murder\\", I have worked my way backwards through the Shakespeare and Smythe mysteries written by Simon Hawke.  \\"A Mystery of Errors\\" is the first in the series of mysteries involving William Shakespeare as sleuth, along with would-be actor Symington \\"Tuck\\" Smythe.  Naturally Hawke's first must include some background information about his characters and the time period, but it never distracts from the story at hand.<br /><br />As would-be actor Tuck makes his way to London to pursue his dream, he chances an encounter with a struggling poet hoping to make his mark on the London stage as well.  Becoming fast friends, the pair winds up in London, and find jobs as ostlers with the Queen's Men.  While not the jobs they had hoped for, they seek all opportunities to rise above their positions and prove their worth.  Shakespeare gets his chance to write for the stage and Smythe his chance to act; but of course, everything does not go according to plan and both find themselves mixed up in murder and intrigue.  Loosely following the plot of \\"A Comedy of Errors\\", the pair must unravel a mystery of murder, mistaken identity and conspiracy that places both of their lives at risk.<br /><br />Hawke has done a masterful job of uniting created characters with historical personages, and brings the Elizabethan theater to vivid life.  In his afterword he acknowledges that he is no scholar on Shakespeare, but has taken the liberty to portray him as he has imagined him.  His imagining is funny and likeable, mixing lines of dialogue from Shakespeare's plays into his 'fictional' counterpart's quips and exchanges.  And while some purists may grimace at the thought of using Shakespeare as a fictional character, most assuredly the playwright himself would sanction it - for he himself wouldn't have had the plays he wrote if he didn't borrow (or downright steal) from other sources.  \\"A Mystery of Errors\\" is a fine introduction to the series, but I have found them just as enjoyable to read out of order, and look forward to reading more.a fine introduction to the series, but I have found them just as enjoyable to read out of order, and look forward to reading more.	2005-08-21

She desperately wants to distance herself from her parents, but at every turn, finds herself face to face with her 'memories' of what happened during the war.<br /><br />Pilcer explores the concept of memories being passed down, or inherited, by the children of survivors.  Zosha feels like she has lived through her parents' experiences, that she understands them, if only because she is their child.  She has the nightmares of a survivor, even though she wasn't born until after the war.  And despite her mother's efforts to keep her daughter unburdened by her memories, they are transmitted to her daughter nevertheless.<br /><br />\\"The Holocast Kid\\" is an interesting concept, a collection of stories that span Zosha's liftime.  However, there seems to be little common thread between the pieces, which jut back and forth in time, with no age or year reference to guide the reader.  A few of the characters, especially the men in Zosha's life, seem flat and one-dimensional, existing as mere cardboard foils for Zosha.  Yet there is a strange mix of humor wrapped around these stories about the tragedy of the Holocaust.  Pilcer's novel is a quick, oftentimes entertaining read, that doesn't quite live up to its potential.	2005-08-16

Iain Pears has crafted a historical mystery that brings both his wide cast of characters and the seventeenth century to life.  Set in Oxford in 1663, \\"An Instance of the Fingerpost\\" weaves in and out of time, and through four separate narrators, to uncover the events that led up to the trial and death of Sarah Blundy.<br /><br />The novel begins with its first narrator, Marco da Cola, an Italian gentleman who dabbles in medicine, who is visiting England on family business (or so he claims).  His narration introduces us to Pears' wide array of historical and created characters and their interactions with each other.  When Dr. Grove, an Oxford professor, is found dead, foul play is suspected.  Poison is found in his brandy, and all signs and witnesses point to Sarah Blundy, Grove's former servant, as the murderer.  Well-known and leered at in Oxford as the daughter of a radical, a witch, and a whore, few come to her defense, and she is sentenced to death by hanging and fire.  Case closed, da Cola can return to Italy and all the characters can resume their day-to-day affairs.<br /><br />But all is not as it seems, for three other characters offer their takes on what happened during those fateful days in 1663, and each fingers a different murderer, meaning that Sarah Blundy was falsely accused.  Through the words of a Jack Prescott (a young, escaped prisoner trying to clear his father's name of treason), Dr. Wallis (a cryptographer trying to prove that Marco da Cola was not what he seemed to be), and Anthony Wood (a historian with a very close connection to the Blundy family) readers are given the opportunity to explore all possibilities surrounding this crime and their role in the events of that fateful time.<br /><br />\\"An Instance of the Fingerpost\\" is a daunting read, but, for the most part, moves quickly through the stories that each character has to tell.  Pears' tale is elaborate and well-written, rounding out characters as we encounter them later and see them through the eyes of another.  Each separate narrative builds on the previous, knocking down any progress the reader had made into figuring out the mystery at hand, leaving readers guessing until the very end as to who is telling the true versions of events, and who is merely telling their version, or what they wish people to believe.hat each character has to tell.

His prose flows onto the page as natural as flowers spring from the soil or rain falls from the sky.  I think that is an apt comparison since many of his stories consider the relationship between man and nature.  \\"That Distant Land\\" is a collection of twenty-three stories, many of which have been published previously.  They are brought together marvelously, arranged in chronological order from the 1880s to the 1980s, flowing in and out of time with the neighboring stories.<br /><br />Berry's fiction focuses on the invented town of Port William, a small farming community in Kentucky.  For those who have read his novels, the characters and the town are familiar; for those who haven't, Berry's world is so infused with natural grace that one automatically feels at home in Port William and among its inhabitants.  \\"That Distant Land\\" gathers together assorted stories about Port William's characters, some that are familiar and told from a different perspective, and some that might be unknown, but no less familiar.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the stories that told of Ptolemy Proudfoot and his wife, Miss Minnie Quinch.  \\"A Consent\\", the story of their odd courtship, is a story that leaves your soul beaming at the simplicity and overwhelming power of love.  The Proudfoot-Miss Minnie stories add a dimension of humor to this collection that is absent in other stories.  Berry does not rush any of these stories along; some are short, light-hearted anecdotes - others are long, meandering wanders through time and memory.  Perhaps the two most poignant stories in the collection are \\"Fidelity\\" and the title piece.  Centering around Burley Coulter and Mat Feltner respectively, both are about the end of life, of the memories and people who shape our lives and the memories we will leave behind.<br /><br />While telling his stories, working his way through the history of Port William, Berry affirms time and again a world alive with possibilities, to be what it is and also what it once was.  A farmer in the oldest tradition, he is in love with the land and saddened by the 'advances' technology and urban growth have created.  \\"That Distant Land\\" brings this home as it covers nearly a century of change in the world, and the decay that inevitably hits smalltown America, whose inhabitants feel that perhaps they have nothing left to offer their children that would entice them to stay and carry on their way of life.  Berry, time and again, offers this hope, perhaps as a way of challenge.his way through the history of Port William, Berry affirms time and again a world alive with possibilities, to be what it is and also what it once was.

Time and again his novels plumb the depths of the human psyche and heart, trying to figure out what makes his characters tick.  And more often than not, his characters are broken individuals, in search for who they truly are.  Thomas Chippering, the narrator of \\"Tomcat in Love\\" is exactly that - a broken man who must come to terms with his broken marriage, as the only life he has ever known crumbles around him.  Yet while sharing themes from some of O'Brien's other works, \\"Tomcat in Love\\" is a departure due to its comedic nature.<br /><br />Thomas Chippering is a professor of linguistics, and a dashing 6'6\\" self-professed ladies man.  His world revolves around words, is built of words, is destroyed by words.  After losing his wife, childhood sweetheart Lorna Sue, to the arms of another man, Chippering swears to do everything in his power to seek vengeance - to win her back and then dump her as she did him.  Complicating matters are Chippering's new mistress, Mrs. Robert Kooshof, and his personality in general.  You see, Chippering believes himself to be a god in women's eyes; he enjoys and treasures seemingly harmless flirtations and indiscretions, believing that these women adore and swoon over him.  In reality, these women find him lecherous and harassing, his wandering eyes (and sometimes hands) unwelcome intrusions into their lives.<br /><br />\\"Tomcat in Love\\" follows Chippering as he tries to win back his former wife, while his entire life crashes down upon him.  He is forced to question his so-called 'way with women' and examine what he really, truly wants in his life.  He is a laugh-out-loud funny narrator, witty with words and obsessive about telling stories, and also sometimes maddening in his blindness to what he truly is.  He is shallow and self-centered, making one see what women loathe about him and wonder what some women ever saw in him to begin with.  However, all of these elements make Chippering a true O'Brien hero, if hero he can be called.  As usual, he is chased (literally) by the ghosts of Vietnam, and uses his stance as a 'war hero' for defense when desperately needed.  Thomas Chippering is not all that he believes he is cracked up to be, and when his life falls to pieces, O'Brien does a masterful job of navigating the tricky waters of his recovery, or at least what passes for recovery.en hero, if hero he can be called.

It might seem that this small treatise on prayer would be outdated, since it was written over two centuries ago; however, the applications and directions that De Montfort explains are applicable to today's faithful and faithless.<br /><br />De Montfort begins his treatise by addressing various readers, giving them 'gifts', as he calls them, concerning the rosary and the message he is about to present.  The first part of this book reads as a sermon from the saint.  He gives a history of how the rosary came about, how it was first prayed, and the results that various saints achieved from doing so.  He tells of miracles and wonders that accompanied those who faithfully said their rosary.  De Montfort also explains about the Confraternity of the Most Holy Rosary - how members can choose how often they wish to say the rosary.  His point is that the rosary is a prayer that should be concentrated upon; that one well-said rosary is worth more than one hundred hastily said rosaries.<br /><br />The second part of \\"The Secret of the Rosary\\" is dedicated to the instruction on how to say the entire rosary.  De Montfort gives several ways, as well as explanations on what poses we should be in and what our mindset should be when offering this devotion up to heaven.  De Montfort's work is a quick read, especially informative for non-Catholics, and one that not only offers instruction, but also appreciation for the Holy Rosary and the role it can play in the life of one who says it faithfully.	2005-07-31

Having done so, I think the movie did an admirable job in portraying the story at heart; but reading the book is an even more enjoyable experience.  Douglas Adams' sci-fi satire is a blend of all the best of every world.<br /><br />\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is the story of Arthur Dent, an earthman who discovers one Thursday (while trying to keep his house from being bulldozed) that his close friend, Ford Prefect, is from another planet, and that in a matter of minutes, Earth will be destroyed.  The two hitchhike a ride on the Vogon ship that destroys Arthur's home planet just as said destruction is taking place.  What follows afterwards is a wild ride through the universe with the President of the Imperial Galactic Government, Zaphod Beeblebrox, an earthgirl whom Arthur struck out with at a party, and the robot Marvin, who has been given a Genuine People Personality, and is therefore depressed by everything.  Their travels bring them to find out who was behind the destruction of Earth, the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything, and just who happened to be the most intelligent being on Earth before it was destroyed.<br /><br />There's no doubt why Adams' classic satire has become such a classic.  The story is witty, laugh-out-loud funny and, oddly enough, one that readers can identify with.  I look forward to reading the books that follow for more instructions on how to not panic.	2005-07-29

Rebecca Wells disappoints however, by covering ground that is too familiar, even as she throws in new stories for her characters that are so well-known by now.  She even throws in a few new characters that help counterpoint the craziness of the sisterhood, spreading her stories back and forth between the past and the present.<br /><br />\\"Ya-Yas in Bloom\\" welcomes readers back to the small town of Thornton, Louisiana, home of Vivi Walker and her life-long girlfriends.  Once again readers revisit stories of Vivi's youth, with some familiar stories (told from new viewpoints) and some new stories about characters both loved and hated.  The opening piece about Vivi's mom is especially poignant in light of what readers of the past two works know about Mary Katherine \\"Buggy\\" Abbott, as is learning how the four ya-yas met in the first place when they were little girls.  Viewpoints change between adult and child, with some piercing memories from the children.  Once again readers enter into the troubles and traumas of the main characters, knowing that in the end they will wind up happy and carefree, ready to face whatever lies ahead (with a little help from the Holy Lady, of course).<br /><br />Rebecca Wells has created characters that she knows inside and out.  Their voices are distinctly southern, tinted with their Catholic faith and the guilt and sin they face in their lives.  Those familiar with the previous two works know that the story unfolds in a series of vignettes, making the book seem like a collection of endearingly funny family stories.  \\"Ya-Yas in Bloom\\" is a quick, enjoyable read, however, some of the stories sound too contrived, as if the author were reaching too hard to capture what she achieved in the first two books.

He has the uncanny ability to create worlds and characters that spring to life through his poetic images.  He has definitely breathed new life into the Arthurian legends with his Pendragon Cycle.  But \\"Pendragon\\", the fourth book in the series, is perhaps the weakest link.<br /><br />\\"Pendragon\\" is not a continuation of the story that was started through \\"Taliesin\\", \\"Merlin\\", and \\"Arthur\\".  Rather what Lawhead does in this fourth installment is revisit some stories about Arthur's life that either weren't in the previous books or that weren't expounded upon.  This makes the beginning of the story read like left-overs that Lawhead cut from the original work.  There are even times when the story is word-for-word the same as the previous novel.  That being said, \\"Pendragon\\" does begin to build about halfway through the book and the story of Arthur's struggle to save Britain from a barbarian invasion comes to life.<br /><br />While perhaps not the strongest link in the cycle, \\"Pendragon\\" is a continuation of Lawhead's magnificent rendering of Arthur's life.  He has crafted Arthur as a king who is both strong and intelligent, fearless and faithful, seemingly invincible but also somehow mortal (even though he is the forever king).  If readers can stick out the ramshackle beginning, they will not be disappointed in the end.  Especially when the legend of the grail comes into question.  But, as Merlin says, \\"that is a different story\\" and one this reader is looking forward to.	2005-07-26

The sixth installment of the Harry Potter series is perhaps the best in the series by far.  Readers will encounter an older and more mature Harry than they glimpsed in the fifth book.  Truly, one is left wondering where Rowling can go after reading \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\".<br /><br />Returning to Hogwarts for his sixth year, Harry and his friends are constantly aware of the outside world.  War against the Dark Lord is raging; it is even disturbing the Muggle world.  Harry has been christened the 'Chosen One' and must once again endure the stares and taunts that greeted him as a first year at Hogwarts.  He is also still reeling from the death of his godfather at the hands of the Death Eaters.  As if that weren't enough, he must deal with fights amongst his closest friends, learn how to Apparate and try to figure out what Draco Malfoy is really up to when he disappears for great lengths of time.  Nothing can be taken for granted anymore, and Harry receives extra help from Albus Dumbledore as they search through Lord Voldemort's past to try to find out the secrets (and perhaps the vulnerabilities) of his power.<br /><br />\\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" is extremely well-written (as all of the Potter novels have been) and flows effortlessly from beginning to end.  Readers are taken on a sometimes wild and often heart-breaking ride through Harry's triumphs and turmoils as the times grow darker all around him.  Rowling has once again done a superb job in creating a cliffhanger of an ending, leaving the reader thirsting for more, even if that means that everything will end once it arrives.  However, no one will ever truly be able to leave the world of Harry Potter behind once his tale has come to a close.	2005-07-18

At times in her efforts to capture the time period, the language and story have been forced; but all in all she has been true to the author's world.  I believe that \\"Jane and the Stillroom Maid\\" is by far the best mystery out of the first five books in this series.<br /><br />The fifth saga of Jane Austen as detective finds her in Derbyshire, with many a hint of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" settings, in August of 1806.  While out walking, she discovers the corpse of a young gentleman who has been gruesomely murdered; Jane is even more shocked when it turns out that the victim is not a gentleman, but a maid disguised in her master's clothes.  Unable to leave a mystery in the hands of the local (perhaps inept, backwater) town's justice, she begins investigating the matter herself, along with the help of the Gentleman Rogue, Lord Harold Trowbridge.  Jane is insinuated in the plots of the local gentry and must uncover the truth behind the maid's death - not a random act by a madman, but possibly by someone who had everything to lose or gain by the maid's life and death; and there are several characters who fit the bill.<br /><br />Barron has re-created Jane Austen's time perfectly, and the series progressively improves.  This mystery offers plenty of twists and turns, but enough clues are scattered throughout the narrative to lead reader's to the conclusions that Jane herself reaches.  If the next novels are as well-written as the fifth one is, I truly look forward to more of Jane's exploits in sleuthing out the truth among the most dastardly acts.	2005-07-17

And what could be more commonplace than the happenings of a post office; but as with anything in Discworld, this isn't an ordinary post office.<br /><br />Con-man and all around swindler Moist Van Lipwig has been given a second lease on life by Lord Vetinari, tyrant of the city of Ankh-Morpork.  He is assigned the duty of bringing the post office back to life, a job that has frightened to death at least five previous postmasters.  Moist, with no other choice but certain death, grudgingly accepts his role as postmaster, but is always looking for a way out.  As he struggles with living an honest life, he finds that his skills as a con-man may be just what is needed to revive the post office in Ankh-Morpork.  So what if he has to deliver letters that have clogged the building for the past century; the letters aren't dead and they demand deliverance, um, literally.  So what if his fast mouth gets him into trouble with the local pirate and master swindler Mr. Reacher Gilt - his mouth will surely get him out of trouble and help save the day.  Right?<br /><br />\\"Going Postal\\" is a truly marvelous ride through the ordinary insanity of Ankh-Morpork.  Pratchett makes his world come alive to the reader with just the right blend of zany impossibility and common sense.  Readers will enjoy the journey that Moist makes in his reformation from a man who only ever looked out for himself learning the joys (and insanity) of looking out for others.	2005-07-15

It also serves as an introduction to Theodosia Browning, a tea shop owner and amateur sleuth from Charleston, South Carolina.<br /><br />During the annual historic homes garden party, a guest is found dead, a cup of tea clutched in his lifeless hand.  His death is especially bad news for Theodosia and her employees at the Indigo Tea Shop, when poison is found in his teacup.  Unsatisfied by the investigations of the local police, Theodosia takes her curiosity to the highest levels of snooping, putting herself and those she cares about in danger.  As readers follow along with Theodosia's sleuthing, they are treated to tidbits about the history and culture of tea in a world that comes to vivid life through Childs' descriptions.<br /><br />\\"Death by Darjeeling\\" is a pleasant mystery, with the usual twists and turns, but it ends a little too mysteriously - too few clues are given to aid the readers in figuring out the real perpetrator behind the crime; the reader is led off track just as Theodosia was.  Yet Childs' story is well-written and her characters come to life in the readers' imagination.  One can tell that the author knows her mysteries, and her teas; hopefully the mystery side of the tea shop will progress with each new addition to the series.	2005-07-15

It is the tale of William Crimsworth, a man without parents and forsaken by his brother, who is forced to make his own way in the world.  He decides to try his hand at teaching and travels to Brussels to teach English at an all-boys' school.<br /><br />Once at the school in Brussels, he immediately begins a successful, if not profitable, teaching career.  Soon enough he finds himself teaching four classes per week at the neighboring school for girls, and also finds himself falling for the headmistress Mlle. Reuter.  Inexperienced with women, he is susceptible to and deceived by her whiles and charms until love enters his life in the form of a fellow teacher-pupil Frances Henri.  As is to be expected, despite the abuse Crimsworth suffered from his brother, and having nothing of his own, he manages to work his way into wealth and is able to marry the woman he has fallen in love with.<br /><br />At the beginning of \\"The Professor\\", Crimsworth confesses that is narrative his not exciting and he holds true to his word, especially since he can be a rather irksome narrator.  While not a novel to shake the foundations of literature, \\"The Professor\\" offers insights into who Charlotte Bronte would become as a writer.  Her characters, a few who are one-dimensional, are mainly well-sketched and drawn out; and despite her claim to the lack of excitement in her narrator's story, his tale unfolds briskly and with few unexpected revelations.  Having been a governess herself, (the novel is based on her own experiences), Bronte combines asides about the state of education and the relationship that exists between teacher and pupil.  Some of these insights hold true for today as well, making \\"The Professor\\" an undated and well-written account of man's struggle for success and happiness.<br /><br />**Two things I disliked about the Wordsworth Classics edition.

Through a series of letters to a fourteen-year-old girl, a mysterious man named Alberto Knox offers her a free course in philosophy.  He starts the course by delivering questions to Sophie that make her think of who she is and how the world was made.  Alberto then takes her through a brief course on the history of philosophy, from Greek to modern times.  He manages to shake Sophie out of her mundane existence: he compares humans to living on a rabbit's back, content to remain buried way down in the fur, and never questioning or climbing up to the top to examine the world around us, the way philosophers do.<br /><br />Having taken several philosophy classes in college, much of the information covered about various philosophers was not new - but it was a nice, well-organized and summarized review.  Gaarder's Knox peppers his lectures on philosophers with questions and examples that make it easy for the reader, and his fourteen-year-old pupil, to understand.  Yet there is much more than a simple philosophy course taking place.  Soon enough, Sophie and her teacher receive mysterious messages that cause them to question their very existence and the world around them.  Gaarder manages to turn the narrative upside down, requiring even more thought and questioning from the reader so that they might comprehend what is going on in the story.<br /><br />One does not have to agree with every philosophy presented in the book in order to enjoy it: in fact, one would be very confused indeed if they agreed with every notion every philosopher ever set forth.  Gaarder makes the novel an interactive experience, since many of Sophie's questions would be asked by the reader, and the examples put things into perspective.  Gaarder has a fascinating imagination that sweeps the novel along at a brisk pace, especially when he causes the reader to question the very plausibility of the where he is taking the characters he has created.

Lives can be seen as pilgrimages that are made in an effort to find answers to these questions, to fulfill something that is missing in one's life.  The human pursuit of knowledge is a pilgrimage, according to Paul Elie, the author of \\"The Life You Save May Be Your Own\\".  The book is a pilgrimage in itself, to connect four Catholic writers who seem to have little in common other than their faith.<br /><br />Paul Elie begins by tracing briefly over the youths of these four writers; Doris Day, Thomas Merton, Walker Percy, and Flannery O'Connor.  He details their shortcomings and their conversion to Catholicism (except for O'Connor who was a Catholic born and bred).  Each author tries to figure out what their purpose in life is, and what role their faith plays in that calling.  Doris Day is the founder of the Catholic Worker, a newsletter, and organization, that strived to fight poverty and advance the true purposes of Christian love.  Thomas Merton feels a calling to the priesthood and settles on a life as a hermit at a monastery in Kentucky.  Walker Percy attends medical school, but after suffering from tuberculosis, reconfigures himself as a writer (even if it takes him the rest of his life to figure out just what or how to write).  Flannery O'Connor, striken with Lupus, must resign herself to a life of illness, searching and traveling almost solely through her writing.<br /><br />Over the years, these four writers formed connections with one another - either through common friends, letters, or personal meetings.  They may have agreed or disagreed with each other, but they recognized the efforts that each were making in the name of their faith.  Paul Elie has done an excellent job in tracing the trials and tribulations that each author experienced, without ever letting his narrative bogged down.  And one does not have to have read every piece of writing by these authors; Elie's exegesis of their works is sufficient, and perhaps a prompter to read (or re-read) some of these profound works that demonstrate how one's faith can be pursued in every aspect of one's life.ead every piece of writing by these authors; Elie's exegesis of their works is sufficient, and perhaps a prompter to read (or re-read) some of these profound works that demonstrate how one's faith can be pursued in every aspect of one's life.	2005-07-03

Wih such a vast following of fans, it is natural that numerous people have taken advantage of the plotlines and characters that Jane Austen created for their own imagination and gain.  Some do the great author and her creations justice, while many let their imaginations run wild and undermine the characters that Austen fans hold dear.  While I was impressed with Pamela Aidan's first venture to uncover the backstory of Fitzwilliam Darcy, the beloved counterpart to Elizabeth Bennet in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", her second foray into Darcy's character runs off-track half-way through the book.<br /><br />The first half of \\"Duty and Desire\\", the second in Aidan's Darcy series, is in keeping with the book.  Returning home to Pemberley, Darcy takes charge of his duty to his sister Georgiana.  He hopes to find her fully recovered from her disastrous turn at the hands of the rake Wickham (who has lately insinuated himself among the Bennets and Hertfordshire).  After guaranteeing that Mr. Bingley has decided to forget about Jane Bennet, and that his sister has truly recovered from her past tribulations, Darcy turns himself to trying to forget about Elizabeth Bennet.  Yet everything (and I mean everything) seems to bring her to mind.  In an effort to forget her, he accepts an invitation from an old school friend, and here is where the author's imagination goes far off the Austen map into uncharted and unwelcome territory.<br /><br />While at his friend's castle, Darcy uncovers an unlikely plot involving magical charms and conjurations more fitting to the gothic novels of Austen's time.  Perhaps this was Aidan's desire, but it is not in keeping with Darcy's character.  I found myself plodding through the last hundred pages, wondering where this story was taking the main character.  I'm not even sure the author herself knew.  The story would have been stronger kept in familiar ground - at Pemberley, in London, with Georgiana.  Aidan's excuses for what occupied Darcy's time while away from Hertfordshire are too fanciful to be believable, or desired.  And, as the reader knows, nothing Darcy does can put Elizabeth Bennet from his mind, and we must wait and pay for the next installment to the series.  Here's hoping Aidan does the justice to Austen's ending that she couldn't do to her own conjectures.away from Hertfordshire are too fanciful to be believable, or desired.

It was a pleasure to reacquaint myself with Hercule Poirot, her unassuming, unlikely detective.  When Poirot is called back from the middle east to London, he finds himself aboard the Orient Express with a wide cast of characters, unlikely at such a dead travel time of year.  When a passenger is found murdered on the third day of the journey, Poirot sets himself to the task of figuring out who is responsible.<br /><br />With the train stopped by an unexpected snowstorm, Poirot is convinced that the murder, or murderers, is still on board.  He begins by fortuitously uncovering the true identity of the murder victim, then proceeds to interview the passengers as to their actions the night before.  With no way to check their stories, he and his fellow companions must use their reasoning to figure out the mystery at hand.  Yet with each interview that precedes, more and more information is brought to light that confounds, rather than enlightens, the detective process.  With several well-placed red herrings and a few 'blink-and-you'll-miss-it' clues, Poirot is able to dispell the mystery surrounding the murder and present the solution, or solutions, to everyone on board.<br /><br />\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is a well-written and fast-paced novel.  Agatha Christie knew how to throw in twists that at once confound the facts at hand but never distract from the story.  Hercule Poirot, easily unlikeable (in the hands of a lesser writer) for his know-it-all pomposity, is perhaps Christie's best known and best liked detective with good reason.  The case she has conceived for him in this novel is a mystery lover's dream.	2005-06-21

It is the story of a great-aunt told to her great-niece, who mixes in her own observations about her aunt's life and her experience as a Chinese-American among her narrative.<br /><br />\\"Bound Feet and Western Dress\\" tells the story of the author's great-aunt, Chang Yu-i.  Born in 1900, Yu-i was the first woman in her family to refuse to have her feet bound.  Despite being modern in this aspect, she is stunted and traditional in her upbringing, her education, and the way she acts in her first marriage.  She is famous for having perhaps the first \\"modern\\" divorce in China and is determined to make it on her own from that point on.  No one in her family truly knows her story until her great-niece asks her to tell it.<br /><br />What passes between the two of them may not be a ground-breaking, fascinating story but is rather a quiet reflection on growing up in a changing time.  Yu-i struggles through a great majority of her life to be both modern and traditional, to do what is 'right and expected' and to do what she wanted to do.  She is an inspiration to her great-niece, a first generation Chinese-American who feels at home with neither nationality.  The intersections of the author's remembrances of past encumbrances fit nicely with Yu-i's struggle to bridge the past with the new.  \\"Bound Feet and Western Dress\\" offers a poignant look at the role that women have played in China and how they are defining themselves today.	2005-06-20

James has crafted a mesmerizing mystery with \\"A Certain Justice\\".  Various reviewers have seemed to criticize the fact that there is more story than mystery to James's works, but that is what sets her apart from other mystery writers; her world and characters come to life through her writing.  The reader learns so much about the characters that the reader feels as if they know them personally, and therefore take an interest in what happens to them.<br /><br />\\"A Certain Justice\\" centers around the murder of Venetia Aldridge, a criminal lawyer who was good at winning but perhaps even better at making others dislike her.  Like most P.D. James books, \\"A Certian Justice\\" begins by sketching the lives of the characters who will intersect through murder before the second part of the book.  Before Adam Dalgliesh even enters the scene, the reader is introduced to a wide cast of characters, some who have been given means and motive to wish Venetia Aldridge dead.  Along with his investigation team, which includes Kate Miskin and Piers Tarrant, Dalgliesh sets to interviewing the members of Venetia's law offices to try to unravel the mystery of her death.<br /><br />As is to be expected in any mystery novel, twists and subplots are thrown in that weave around the central plot.  In \\"A Certain Justice\\" they are well-written and do not distract from the story at hand.  Some reviewers have written of being disappointed by the ending to this novel, but it is a reflection of reality, and the system that Venetia Aldridge worked in.  James has never been an author to lay everything out for her readers; rather she leaves little clues along the way, which may seem insignificant at first, for her readers to piece together the author of the crimes committed in her stories.	2005-06-18

At a mere 140 pages, \\"The Luneburg Variation\\" has a lot of ground to cover.  Paolo Maurensig tells the story quickly, through two different narrators, combining the elements of chess with all the atmosphere of a classic mystery thriller.<br /><br />The novel opens with the death of a wealthy businessman.  He is found dead, apparently from suicide, and the only clue is a chessboard made out of rags, with buttons for pieces, that is set up in a complicated mid-game position that lies beside his body.  Maurensig weaves together the two separate narrations between the two sections of the novel.  We learn that one narrator is 'responsible' for the businessman's death but we do not learn why, or how, until the end of the work.  Paolo Maurensig takes the reader through a brief history of chess that even those not proficient at the game can understand.  His characters have devoted their lives to chess - for some it has driven them crazy and torn them apart (like one of the narrators), while others they can separate it from the rest of their lives (like the dead businessman).<br /><br />Yet the story is not solely about chess, where the outcome of a game can have life or death consequences, especially when one narrator finds himself in a Nazi death camp with his nemesis.  What lies at the heart of the story is the mystery surrounding the death of this wealthy businessman; Maurensig gives the readers the clues, but does not state the answer directly.  \\"The Luneburg Variation\\" ends as if the author and the reader were playing a game of chess, and the author says \\"Your move.\\"	2005-06-14

While Valjean is the main character and one that the reader follows throughout the whole novel, there are other characters who are just as important.  Yet \\"Les Miserables\\" is not a literary work that can be summed up by who the characters are and what happens to them.  Victor Hugo, a master writer, weaves his tale together with his thoughts, philosophies, and at times, judgments on the way man treats man as well as how the world works in general.<br /><br />Anyone familiar with \\"Les Miserables\\" knows that it is the story of Jean Valjean, a thief who spent almost two decades in prison, trying to follow the right path in life.  He rescues the young, abused Cosette from the villanious Thenardiers at her mother's request, and raises her as his own.  Never truly knowing love, he learns to love Cosette and sees her as his own daughter.  All the while he is mercilessly hunted by the police inspector Javert, who follows the law to the letter and will stop at almost nothing to see the convict Jean Valjean back in prison.  As Cosette grows up and Valjean seeks to spend his life in the background, she falls in love with the revolutionary idealist Marius; Jean Valjean risks losing her, the only person he has ever loved.  All of these storylines  weave and converge over the background of Paris on the brink of revolution, each character tautly combined with the others, even when they are unaware of these connections.<br /><br />Other readers have stated that reading the abridged version of \\"Les Miserables\\" will suffice so that the reader does not read 'unnecessary' accounts of the battle of Waterloo, the Paris sewage system, etc...  Yet it is these very longwinded transgressions from the story that add to the story.  It offers readers the chance to step inside the Paris of Jean Valjean's time and it is here where Hugo expostulates his philosophies on man and life, allowing the readers to understand what shapes the character of his characters.  Perhaps his most vivid picture of a character is found in Javert.  Hugo offers the following story as a description for this ruthless inspector: that in every pack of wolves that is born, the mother kills one wolf in fear that it would grow up and kill its siblings - that is Javert in his pursuit of Jean Valjean.<br /><br />Hugo's writing is rich in description and in \\"Les Miserables\\" the whole of Paris, including the seedy underworld of crime, is brought to life through the author's attention to detail.  While any work that is nearly 1500 pages can be daunting, it is always a pleasant experience to step into the worlds that Hugo creates and sustains.  \\"Les Miserables\\" can truly stand the test of time due to characters and situations that are not that far removed from anyone or anything today.life, allowing the readers to understand what shapes the character of his characters.

In \\"The Town Beyond the Wall\\" readers are introduced to Michael, a Jew who has survived the Holocaust and spends the rest of his life searching for meaning and answers to questions that may not even have answers.  Wiesel's stories are driven by questions and the memories that haunt his characters.<br /><br />\\"The Town Beyond the Wall\\" is told through flashbacks.  Michael, the narrator, is being tortured in jail after finding his way back home inside the Iron Curtain.  His torture is the 'prayer', to stand face to a wall until the pain in his legs causes him to speak.  But Michael is strong and resists telling on his friend because he wishes to save a life.  He no longer cares about God or religion.  He is plagued by memories of his childhood and the regrets he has about actions not taken.  He desperately wants answers but knows that some of his questions have no answers.<br /><br />Wiesel is a master storyteller.  He creates characters who are vivid and alive, perhaps because they are endowed with who he is.  In \\"The Town Beyond the Wall\\" he has crafted perhaps his most optimistic tale, ending with a parable that is at once as thought-provoking as it is disturbing.  Perhaps Wiesel has Michael sum up the story the best with these words: \\"...it isn't easy to live always under a question mark.  But who says that the essential question has an answer?  The essence of man is to be a question, and the essence of the question is to be without an answer.\\"	2005-05-27

There are many books out there that exploit her stories, plotlines, and characters and add nothing to what she has created.  I was pleased upon reading the first of the \\"Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman\\" series to discover how much Pamela Aidan has added to the wonderful \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" without taking away from the story that Austen fans love and know by heart.<br /><br />\\"An Assembly Such As This\\" is only the first third of the \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" story; however, it is told through the eyes of Mr. Darcy.  Throughout Jane Austen's novel, readers are delighted by the interactions between Mr. Darcy and our lovely protagonist Elizabeth Bennet, but are never given true access to Mr. Darcy's thoughts and inner torment.  Pamela Aidan has done a commendable job of placing herself inside the mind of, perhaps, the most desireable male character ever written.  Readers will be delighted with her imaginings of Darcy's reactions to his first encounters with Elizabeth Bennet.  Aidan gives palpable voice to Darcy's struggle between despising Elizabeth's family and lack of connection, and the natural attraction he feels due to her beauty and unflinching wit.<br /><br />If there is anything to criticize with the novel, it is perhaps that there is too much of the female in Mr. Darcy's voice.  Yes, he is smitten with Elizabeth Bennet, but his expostulations sometimes sound downright 'girly' at times, and it is hard to imagine a man so obsessed with his object of affection.  Yet that hardly detracts from the novel.  It is well-written, with an overwhelming eye for detail of the time period, and is a relatively quick read.  For those Austen fans who wish she had written more, \\"An Assembly Such As This\\" is a commendable and thoroughly enjoyable addition to her masterful story.	2005-05-21

Complicating matters are the search for a French renegade who was undercover at Holy Cross in the guise of the nephew of Father Ailnoth's housekeeper.  Brother Cadfael must piece together the scant clues and abounding rumors to uncover the truth of Ailnoth's death.<br /><br />\\"The Raven in the Foregate\\" is a well-written mystery, although at times too tidy and predictable.

James' mysteries, I was pleasantly surprised to discover this true crime book she had written with the historian T.A. Critchley.  \\"The Maul and the Pear Tree\\" tells the tale of some sinister and disturbing murders that horrified and shocked the London docks in 1811.  Through recreating the time period, studying testimony and accounts of the day, both author and historian have crafted an interesting read about not only murder but also about the restrictions of a rudimentary police system in trying to apprehend an otherwise unheard of serial killer.<br /><br />In December of 1811, seven people were brutally slain.  The first victims were the Marr family; a husband, wife, their infant son, and the boy who worked in their shop.  All were found beaten to death with their throats cut to the neckbone, including the newborn son.  The second victims were the Williamsons, the proprietors of a pub, who were slain in almost exactly the same manner as the Marrs.<br /><br />The search that had begun with the Marr's murders, continued when the killer struck a second time.  The clues were few, but included the murder weapon alluded to in the book's title.  The testimony (both real and speculative) was plentiful, and the community was filled with terror and suspicion.  The magistrates had an incredible task before them - to capture a killer before he, or they, since the evidence surely represented more than one killer, could strike again.<br /><br />In 1811, the different policing agencies did not work together, and very rarely shared the information they received with another branch.  This combined with sketchy details, suspicious neighbors, and the number of superfluous informants who came forward with information made a virtual circus of the trial process.  Arrested and jailed on circumstantial evidence, a man by the name of John Williams was assumed to be the ghastly murderer that everyone had been searching for.  Yet before he could be convicted of any crime, he was found hanged in his jail cell, apparently a self-murder.  Yet the evidence shows that more than one person was involved in the murders of these two families.  James and Critchley lay the groundwork for who the accomplices, or even who the mastermind behind these murders, might be.  The author and historian even call into question whether or not Williams was set up and murdered by the real killer in order to guarantee his own escape.

The reader follows the adventures of Captain Alexander de Milja through various disguises and countries in the early years of WWII.

The first section of the novel does grab the reader's attention - de Milja sneaks the national gold reserve out of Poland, on a train carrying unwitting passengers to saftey through a war-torn country.  Yet Furst throws too many characters, who do not add to the story, into the mix.  And as de Milja moves from job to job, from personality to personality, the reader is not always brought along: it is as if one were beginning a new book with each new personality, for there is little tie between any of the main character's exploits except his thoughts.<br /><br />\\"The Polish Officer\\" reads as if it were trying, desperately, to be a great work of literature.  Furst seems to be follwing a formula card of what \\"seemed inevitable\\" when it comes to writing spy thrillers.  The story takes expected turns, offering little original in the way of plotting.

From the description of Julie Richards on the book cover, we know that she is a hard worker, and we know that her life isn't going to be easy.  Set at the end of the nineteenth century, \\"Gap Creek\\" focuses on the marriage of Julie and Hank Richards, as they experience the downs more than the ups of starting a life on their own.<br /><br />Julie and Hank's marriage is a loving one.  They set out to live at Gap Creek, but a series of events leads them into poverty and despair.  Their landlord is burned and killed in a fire at the house; they are subjected to several con-artists who pretend to want to help them; Hank loses his job and Julie finds herself pregnant; and they have to endure a flood that nearly sweeps them and their house away.  Yet through it all, Julie, and then Hank, are able to find solace in their faith and in one another.  They endure their hard times to start over once again.<br /><br />Robert Morgan's writing is rich with detail.

He is adoring in his praise for works he loves, and critical of works that he believes to have failed.

Lewis' thoughts on literature, I believe, is the next best thing to having had him as a professor of literature.  One can only imagine what it must have been like to be a student of this thoroughly intelligent and well-read man - many of his students must have been intimidated.  Yet the reader is given the opportunity to see the ligther side of Lewis in the final piece entitled 'Unreal Estates', a recorded conversation between Lewis, Kingsley Amis, and Brian Aldiss, that is filled with the author's incomparable humor.  Having grown up on Lewis' stories, it was wonderful to read his thoughts (and the pictures that sparked those thoughts) behind them.	2005-04-16

She gained international success with the English publication of \\"The Thief Lord\\" and continued to spin her magic with the spellbinding \\"Inkheart\\".  Having enjoyed these two forays into the mythical world of children, I was looking forward to reading \\"Dragon Rider\\" and was not disappointed.<br /><br />\\"Dragon Rider\\" has a more mythical setting, in the fact that it asks the reader to believe that fantastic creatures exist in the same realm as humans.  The last of the known dragons on earth are facing eviction from their peaceful valley due to the expansion of humans.  Firedrake, one brave dragon, agrees to search for the Rim of Heaven - a magical hiding place of the dragons, that may or may not exist.  Along with his brownie friend Sorrel, they pick up a human boy named Ben as they travel the world in their quest.  Along the way that meet humans who both help and harm, as well as other fantastic creatures who help and harm.  Their journey is impeded through the evil machinations of Nettlebrand, the Golden One.  A manmade dragon with impenetrable metal scales, Nettlebrand was designed to destroy all of the silver dragons.  With the aide of his frightened servants, Nettlebrand tracks Firedrake, Sorrel and Ben as they make their way towards the Rim of Heaven, so that he may hunt and kill the last of the dragons.<br /><br />Funke's story is filled with vivid and well-rounded characters.  She weaves age-old stories with original plotlines, creating a story that no reader could put down until they know what happens to the heroes.  \\"Dragon Rider\\" is filled with adventure and humor, a truly delightful story for children, as well as for the child inside every adult.	2005-04-12

While \\"Drowning Ruth\\" is no ordinary mystery, its tale unfolds in such a way as to hook the reader and to perhaps even throw the reader off track as to what the actual mystery of the story is.  Christina Schwarz has proven herself to be a talented storyteller as she spins and unravels the web of deceit that has plagued three members of one family.<br /><br />In 1919, Mathilda Neumann is found drowned in the lake which she has lived near her entire life.  She had been living on her own with her baby daughter, waiting for her wounded husband to return home from WWI.  Her sister, Amanda returns home in order to take care of her sister, but has a deeper, darker secret that she cannot reveal to anyone, save her sister, and only when it becomes apparent that she can hide her secret no longer.  Upon Mathilda's death, Amanda resumes responbility for Ruth, the daughter left behind by both parents, and continues her control over Ruth even after the child's father has returned, serving much more as a mother than an aunt.  \\"Drowning Ruth\\" is told through several narrators, skipping back and forth in time and between persons, as the story of what really happened on the dark winter night that Mathilda drowned finally reveals itself to the reader.<br /><br />Schwarz has created vivdly realistic characters in Amanda and Ruth, the two main forces of the novel.  The reader watches as Ruth grows up, from an unruly, sullen child to a shy, unassuming young woman destined to always be seen as the odd one.  The fluctuation between times and narrators hooks the reader desperate to know what happened out on the lake in the winter of 1919.  Schwarz allows details of the story to be confirmed, but holds the total truth of the matter for the bittersweet ending.	2005-04-02

It is a collection of short biographical sketches and observations about the lives a various influential writers, thinkers, and theologians.  Or perhaps all of the men described her meet all three of those descriptions.<br /><br />At first there might not seem to be a common tie between such men as Saint Augustine, Blaise Pascal, William Blake, Soren Kierkegaard, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Leo Tolstoy, and Dietrich Bonhoeffer: yet Muggeridge makes the claim that all of them were spiritual wanderers, devoted to a search for God in their own time.  He calls these men 'God's spies' as they endeavored to make the truth of the gospels shine in the dark times in which they lived.  All of the men Muggeridge devotes his time to went through a crisis in their life or in their nation.  They found strength through their relationship with God to overcome these travials and serve as a bastion for their faith.  They, alone sometimes, were the bright light shining through the overcrowding darkness.<br /><br />Muggeridge's portraits are brief, but succinctly complete.  Even without having read anything by some of these men, the reader is not at a loss.  Muggeridge aptly portrays how their faith affected their lives, and interweaves their own thoughts with his, and the observations of those who knew these great spies.  What \\"A Third Testament\\" causes in the readers is a renewed sense of wonder at the men God uses for His purposes - these motley men who challenged their countrymen to repudiate false teachings.  Indeed, their challenge has survived throughout the generations, and is just as necessary today as it was when they were living.	2005-03-31

Steinbeck is a gifted writer, and his talents are on full display as he chronicles the upheaval and trials of the Joad family, a band of 'Okies' who leave Oklahoma in hopes of a better life in California.  Their story isn't specific to the Joads alone; it is the story of the dispossessed whose dreams continued to float away from them despite their best efforts to achieve them.<br /><br />The Joad family is forced to leave their home and believe a better life awaits them in California.  Steinbeck chronicles in unflinching and bitter reality the travails of life on the road.  He poignantly describes the hatred and greed of the rich against the poor, and the effect that mass-farming will have on the land.  He captures the migrant life with vivid detail and touching observations.<br /><br />Steinbeck alternates between the Joad family's quest and the quest of all the dispossessed - the alternating chapters filled with descriptions of life during 1930s America, the depression and greed that collided when the have nots met those who had.  The characters in \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" continuously search for a better life, a life that is just as continuously denied them, as their family and their willpower breaks down.  Steinbeck leaves the reader wondering what will become of the Joad family, and the others like them.  And although we can guess what their plight will continue to be, the astute author leaves the reader with an indelible image of hope, however bittersweet.	2005-03-30

In the first novel, readers were introduced to Tom Ripley - a poor player who wishes for a better life and achieves it through ill-gotten gains.  The charm of Tom Ripley is that even though he is an amoral murderer, the reader roots for him to get away with all the evil deeds he has committed.<br /><br />This second book finds him married and living a rather quiet, peaceful life in France.  He is the conspirator of Derwatt Ltd., a company that manufactures paintings by an artist who has supposedly been dead for the past six years.  When questions of forgery arrive through an American visitor, Tom impersonates the artist but to little avail.  He later introduces himself to the American visitor as Tom Ripley, and invites him to his home in France to view the two Derwatt paintings he owns, in a desperate attempt to persuade the man to change his mind.  Despite all his charm and storytelling, the man refuses to budge on his theory and plans to seek out an expert when he returns to London.  Tom knows that he must take matters into his own hands to prevent this and the damage it would cause to everyone involved.<br /><br />Tom Ripley is a thoroughly interesting character.  He is intelligent and philosophical despite his amoral adventures into corruption and murder.  He truly believes that he is doing what is best for himself and those involved.  As the story progresses, and the situation becomes even more desperate, there seems to be far too many loose ends to tie up - and Highsmith doesn't end them tidily.  She leaves room open for the series to continue, with questions abounding in the readers' minds.  And through everything we witness Tom do, we still want to see him succeed, even in the most grisly of tasks.	2005-03-25

All three novels stand on their own, but are interconnected in one book due to the fact that the lives of every character intermingles with that of others.<br /><br />'Nathan Coulter' is a tender coming-of-age story, as our young narrator explores and explains his life and the world around him.  Poetically we are told the ramblings and fights of Tom and Nathan, the two Coulter brothers raised by their grandparents after the death of their mother.  Nathan is an honest and perceptive storyteller, revealing the innocent and wondering notions of a young boy's mind.<br /><br />'Remembering' is a starker novel in contrast to the other two in the collection.  It tells the story of a grown Andy Catlett, an agricultural journalist and farmer, trying to come to terms with a devestating injury.  During the process of farming, he lost his right hand and struggles with both the physical demands of his deformity, as well as the psychological and emotional demands it places upon himself, and his family and friends.  The novel shifts in perspective from past to present, fluctuating between Andy's memories, and his rememberings of the stories he has been told about his family and his town.  The ending is bittersweet and poignant, as Andy returns home and comes to terms with the life he must now lead.<br /><br />After being introduced to the grown Andy Catlett in 'Remembering', readers are introduced to him as a boy in 'A World Lost'.  In this novel he reminisces about his childhood and the idol of his younger days - Andrew Catlett, his uncle and namesake.  When Andy was just a young boy of nine, his uncle was murdered and he accepted the story that had been fed him.  He experiences his own grief as well as that of his family, all the while painting a vivid image of the wild man his uncle was.  It isn't until his later years that Andy begins to question the story surrounding his uncle's murder, and searches out sources to learn the truth about the man he most admired.<br /><br />Berry's stories always unfold delicately.  He has imagined the lives of every inhabitant of Port William and its surrounding communities so well that they come to life of their own initiative in the reader's mind.  His novels are odes to a simpler time and life, to the relationship man should have with the earth, to the ties that bind all of us to each other.  His novels are welcome escapes into a world that seems irrevocably lost.  Berry offers readers the hope that this world could exist again.that had been fed him.

Although second in the series, the novels could stand by themselves as intricately clever mysteries that do not rely upon having read the previous story.  While Hawke does indulge in some 'this is what happened previously' to flesh out the characters' backgrounds it doesn't distract from the story at hand.<br /><br />\\"The Slaying of the Shrew\\" finds the Queen's Men in the midst of the plague season, traveling the countryside on tour.  Their first commission is to play at the highly staged wedding of Sir Godfrey Middleton's daughter Catherine, a shrew by reputation, naturally unhappy with an arranged marriage.  Tuck Smythe immediately finds himself involved in scandal when he overhears a plot in which he deduces that Catherine shall be murdered so that the murderer may marry the younger daughter,Blanche,and inherit more money.  His involvement in this intrigue naturally leads him to seek the help of his friend and roommate, William Shakespeare.  Together they try to solve the mystery but not before several murders take place and serve to throw them off track.<br /><br />The beauty of Hawke's mysteries is the smooth intermingling of humor and mystery.  His fashioning of quotes from Shakespeare's plays as everyday bits of dialogue is delightful and pithy word play abounds in puns - one of Shakespeare's favorite devices.  Hawke also combines elements from various plays in the plotline.  Fans of Shakespeare will enjoy the characterization of Will, and the all too natural marriage of drama and mystery.  I look forward to reading the other mysteries in this series.	2005-03-11

As he says in his introduction the story springs from his imagination, \\"I speak for my protagonist, but he does not speak for me.  He has lived through some of my experiences, but I have not lived through his.\\"  And those experiences are what motivate and frustrate the main character throughout the course of this novel.<br /><br />\\"The Accident\\" tells the story of Eliezer, a survivor of the death camps, who cannot forget his past.  He is constantly haunted by his memories and those who have died, so much so that he cannot even live his life.  So when he his hit by a taxi one summer evening, the reader is unsure whether it was on purpose or if it was an accident.  As he lies in his hospital bed, not necessarily fighting for his life, his story fluctuates between the past and present, allowing the reader to enter into his suffering and understand his misery.<br /><br />As always, Wiesel's writing is full of questions.  For a Jew who survived the horror of the Holocaust, these questions always include how God could have allowed this to happen.  Eliezer is convinced that God uses humans as toys to manipulate and enjoy their sufferings.  He is finally brought to terms with his inability to live and what he needs to do in order to leave his past where it belongs and move ahead with his future.  \\"The Accident\\" is a quick read, full of daunting questions and fearless searching that typifies Wiesel's writings.	2005-03-05

It's a lot for a writer to ask the readers to suspend disbelief as Clare and Henry's relationship takes place year after year, or year before year, depending on the situation.  Yet Niffenegger is a gifted writer with an overwhelmingly truthful voice that resonates within her two central characters and their most unusual relationship in \\"The Time-Traveler's Wife\\".<br /><br />Clare Abshire is still a young girl when she firsts meets Henry DeTamble, a chronically disabled man who involuntarily time travels into the past and future.  At first she fails to believe Henry's radical story, but when she witnesses him disappear, she knows he is telling the truth.  For over twelve years they have these meetings in the field behind Clare's girlhood house, and Clare learns of the future they'll share together as husband and wife.  Yet Henry has never met Clare in the present; so when they actually run into each other, she is the one with all the memories of their past, while he holds the key to their future together.<br /><br />Niffenegger weaves her story between the narrations of both Clare and Henry as the years progress.  While unbelievable in the extreme, the reader buys into Henry's story and the dangers he stumbles upon when he travles through time.  We yearn and sympathize with Clare as she desperately loves a man who leaves her alone far too often, after she's waited for him her entire childhood.  \\"The Time-Traveler's Wife\\" is beautifully written, with descriptive passages leaning more towards poetry than to prose.  Niffenegger has spun a fantastic story, filled with laughter and heartbreack and established herself as a voice to be reckoned with.	2005-03-05

It seems incongruous that Michael J. Fox has written such a humble memoir when he is best known for somewhat callous, self-centered characters on the screen.  Yet throughout the course of his reminiscing, he talks about his choices to leave the 'magical world' of Hollywood for a real life.  However, his celebrity status is always there, for better or worse.<br /><br />Fox begins his book with the tale of how he discovered that he had Parkinson's Disease.  He goes through the entire denial process, and 'hides' his disease for so long due to the fact that he hasn't come to terms with it.  He needed to accept it as his fate before he could share it with the world.  His memoir is broken into segments of his life, and Fox summarily describes his Canadian upbringing, how he dropped out of high school to pursue acting in Hollywood, and the years he struggled until he hit financial and celebrity success with \\"Family Ties\\" and the \\"Back to the Future\\" trilogy.  He takes an unflinching look at his box-office failures, movies he acted in more so for financial reasons than creative ones, and an even starker look at his once overpowering dependency on alcohol to help him mask his fears about having PD.  In the end, he recounts why he considers himself to be lucky even though he has an incurable neurological disease, and why he is more than happy to lend his name to finding a cure.<br /><br />Michael J. Fox has written a witty, poignant memoir, filled with the wry humor that made him a beloved household name.  He holds nothing back in his memoir, and never once searches for pity.  He is at peace with his fate and the role that he has chosen to play for the rest of his life off the screen - that of an advocate to raise money for Parkinson's research in efforts to find a cure.  Here's hoping that he succeeds.	2005-02-24

Yet these two novels seem to be written by two entirely different people.  While \\"Killing Time\\" is an entirely different yarn than Carr's previous writings, gone are the intellectual research and vivid characters that made his previous words so enjoyable.<br /><br />The novel begins fairly well.  Short chapters, quick to the point, rife with conspiracy that the government intends to keep hidden.  The plot begins by expostulating the world's position in 2024; economic collapse, inescapable wars, rampant pollution.  When the novel's protagonist Gideon Wolfe stumbles upon video that has doctored images of the president's assassination, he finds himself unbelievably caught up in the plans of a group of expatriate idealists.  And this is where the novel jumps off course from political thriller to science-fiction, well, mumbo jumbo of sorts.  This band of characters believe that they can wake the world from its informational corruption by corrupting the information given to them.  The world wants to be deceived.<br /><br />At first Wolfe is swept up in their idealism, but when one of their plots results in a nucelar disaster, Wolfe pulls out and searches for some place in the world that isn't corrupted by the advance of technology and information.  Carr has an interesting premise, but can't bring to fruition the possible destruction of the world through the use of sci-fi language, schemes and characters.  While some predictions are eerily uncanny in a post-9/11 world, his story is too unbelievable to offer any solution to the world's problems.	2005-02-19

The author and filmmaker's encounter with the women who knew Anne Frank, after her family was captured, left him with more material than could ever be told in a documentary.  It is collected here in this powerful and necessary testament to the legacy of Anne Frank.<br /><br />The book begins with a slight overview of Anne Frank's life.  It then gives way to the stories of six women who knew her - some before her deportation to the camps, and all of them during her final days at Bergen-Belsen.  The collection begins with the reminiscences of Hannah Elisabeth Pick-Goslar, Anne's childhood friend (who she wrote about in her diary), who later threw her Red Cross packages across the barbed-wire fence of the camp when they miraculously encountered one another again.  The stories the women have to tell are similar - their treatment in the camp, the way they met Anne and Margot - and all of them were inexplicably touched by her life.  Some felt an overwhelming sense of failure at not being able to do more to help these poor sisters, but there was little they could do, especially when both were fighting typhus and had little will, or strength, to survive.  At least one even made comment that had Anne known her father was still alive, she might have fought a little harder to see her beloved Pip once more.  Anne was the 'apple of her father's eye' and his life after the liberation of Auschwitz was to let her words bear testimony for her.<br /><br />These women all have powerful and miraculous stories to tell.  The fact that they survived the death camp is a miracle in itself.  One of the women's husband survived Auschwitz with Otto Frank and many of them had the privilege of meeting him after the war; and one had the sad 'honor' of confirming Anne and Margot's deaths.  Perhaps the story of Rachel van Amerongen-Frankfoorder is the most compelling for her witness to not only the girls' final days, but to their deaths as well.  Both the Frank girls died of<br />typhus a few short weeks before the liberation of the camps.  \\"The Last Seven Months of Anne Frank\\" is a crucial examination of an amazing life cut short by unimaginable cruelty, and to the miracle of those who survived to tell it in their own words.deaths as well.

James has crafted a superb mystery with \\"A Mind to Murder\\".  The plot is laid out in her trademark style, vascillating between the introspection of the detective Dalgliesh and the testimony of an array of characters.  The story revolves around the murder of Miss Bolam, the administrative officer of the Steen Psychiatric Clinic.<br /><br />Early on, motives and means are laid out for several characters, and Dalgliesh knows that it had to be an inside job.  Miss Bolam was little liked by several employees and seemingly caused rancor everywhere she went.  Yet Dalgliesh feels an overwhelming sense of failure as he tracks down various pieces of evidence.  The storyline is fairly simple, with enough inconsistencies to throw the reader, and possibly Dalgliesh, off the real murderer's trail.<br /><br />A worthy addition to the Dalgliesh series, \\"A Mind to Murder\\" offers Dalgliesh fans rare insight into his feelings about his deceased wife and son, and the insecurities he feels with moving forward with his life.  The characters are well-written as always, and the story is fast-paced.

And perhaps in its day it was just such a mystery.  However, as intriguing as the premise is, the stories fall far short of expectation.<br /><br />\\"The Suicide Club\\" is a collection of three short stories.  The first story is by far the strongest.  There is a thin strand of connection between all three stories that remains uncovered until the end of each piece.  In the first story, Prince Florizel of Bohemia and his companion, disguise themselves and attend a party of men who wish to end their lives.  In what is termed a 'suicide club' men are dealt cards - with certain cards signifying roles that they are destined to play.  Each night two men are chosen - as executioner and the one to be executed in a proscribed manner.  Prince Florizel is sickened at this discovery and vows to hunt down the president of the club to exact his vengeance, hence the two succeeding stories.<br /><br />Robert Louis Stevenson begins with an interesting story idea, but the succeeding two stories subtract more than they add.  If he had developed the first story in a different direction, \\"The Suicide Club\\" might hold the readers' interest for the entire book.  Although a quick read, the last two stories drag through contrivances that are too far-flung to successfully complete the story.	2005-02-10

Having read the previous three, I already knew what to expect.  Barron has a knack for imitating the style of Austen's day and shows a vast array of study into the lifestyles of Austen's time.  The fourth novel in the series proves Jane to be as stalwart a detective as ever.<br /><br />While Jane visits her brother's home of Godmersham, she is inevitably caught up in the tragic events that unfold in Kent.  With the news of a possible French invasion looming on the horizon, a high-spirited French woman is found murdered at the horse races.  Naturally, suspicion falls on the men who were entangled in her web, and her character and affairs with these men are called into question.  But the detective side of Jane suspects that the foul play was due to political motives rather than jealous passions.<br /><br />Barron introduces a wide cast of characters and suspects, and fully fleshes them out as Jane endeavors to solve another mystery.  The novel moves quickly due to Jane's 'journaling' of events, even if at times the story is predictable.  \\"Jane and the Genius of the Place\\" is a worthy addition and homage to Austen.	2005-02-09

In this novel she demonstrates the fact that she knows her main characters inside and out, giving voice to the plights of teenage girls on the verge of adulthood.  The third installment is a worthy addition to the prior novels.<br /><br />Brashares' novels tell the story of four girlfriends, whose mothers were friends before their birth.  Even though their mothers may have lost contact, the girls have remained friends through thick and thin.  And they've seen and experienced enough trouble for more than double their lives.  \\"Girls in Pants\\" finds them in the final summer before they embark for college, when they'll truly be apart for the first time in their lives.  Once again, they pass the magical pants back and forth during the summer, always exactly when one girl needs them the most.  While two of the girls face new and frightening experiences, the other two must encounter past problems and deal with the ghosts that haunt them.<br /><br />Brashares crafts a good story.

Numerous books exist about Hitler, the Jews, the SS, and the concentration camps.  Yet \\"Treblinka\\" by Jean-Francois Steiner sets itself apart from all the others, by actually placing the reader inside the horrors of the concentration camp.  The camp at Treblinka was to become a model for the great death factories, such as Auschwitz-Birkenau.  Yet, in 1943, the prisoners of Treblinka were able to mount a successful revolt and burn the death camp to the ground.<br /><br />Steiner begins his narrative with a look at life in the ghetto.  One of the questions that has plagued writters of the Holocaust, is how the Jews seemed to willingly accept their death as their fate.  Steiner lays out the webwork of the Nazi Technicians, who manipulated the Jews' submissive nature by making them second guess and question every advantage and disadvantage.  The Jews accepted death, but they honored life.  Despite all of their sufferings, the prisoners of Treblinka were able to revolt against a vicious enemy and escape their nightmare lives.  They knew that hardly anyone in the outside world would believe their tales; through various sources, the Jews learned how their stories of the death camps were met with incredulous ears, by Jews and others who refused to accept the truth.  Yet when the entire camp of Treblinka faced liquidation (once the exhumed bodies of the more than 700,000 Jews who had been killed were burned) they chose to honor live so that someone could live to tell their story.<br /><br />\\"Treblinka\\" is a powerful read.  Of the six-hundred prisoners who escaped the death camp, forty of them survived to bear witness to what they had seen the Germans do to the Jewish people.  Steiner has recreated the painful, stifling atmosphere of Treblinka through these accounts, and has taken liberty in recreating conversations to advance the story's narrative.  However, this does not detract from the truth at hand.  These prisoners faced insurmountable odds and death with every miscalculation.  Their actions are extraordinary and beyond measure.  Steiner has created a truly magnificent memorial to those who lost their lives, and those who fought to bear witness.nsurmountable odds and death with every miscalculation.

Reading her reminiscenses and insights is almost just as good as having a one-on-one conversation with the author.<br /><br />In \\"A Circle of Quiet\\", L'Engle traverses vast territory including the inspiration and necessity of writing, to questions that have plagued her about faith and God.  She is intelligent in her answers and able to recognize her own failings.  For such a talented writer, it is amazing that L'Engle endured years of rejection.  No one wanted to take a chance on stories that couldn't be categorized.  While some may see L'Engle as only a children's author, she is dead-on in her insistence that there is no separation between what makes a book a good children's or adult's book.  The fictional stories of imagination should appeal to all ages if they are open to discover the truths that they seek.<br /><br />L'Engle smartly covers so-called taboo issues and the effect that the changing nature of education and language has played on America's youth.  \\"A Circle of Quiet\\" is truly a wonderful conversation with a cherished friend.  Peppered with analogies of her own life and those of her friends and community, she tries to find a light in the darkness that surrounds all of us.  In the end, she succeeds.	2005-01-22

The concept was intriguing - a nun suffering from severe headaches must determine whether the visions she has been blessed with are from God or a side effect of her affliction.  As the reader learns more about Sister John of the Cross, the reader is drawn into her quest to truly know and serve the Lord with all that she is.<br /><br />Sister John of the Cross is a contemplative nun who has devoted her life to serving the Lord.  When she first begins suffering from these migraines, she finds herself in an even deeper relationship with God.  Words flow from her into notebooks of poetry and she feels an overwhelming sense of completeness in her prayer life.  Yet when a doctor diagnoses her condition as a sort of epilepsy, she must make a decision between her visions and a surgery that would take them away.  As a nun, she must search for God's will instead of her own.<br /><br />Mark Salzman is a gifted writer.  \\"Lying Awake\\" is beautifully written and filled with imagery that comes to life before the reader's eyes.  He weaves Sister John's story with her earlier years, and with the struggle and the doubt that she endured before her headaches began.  Salzman eloquently paints pictures of the nuns' daily lives, interspersing his prose with biblical quotes and prayers that enhance the story.  \\"Lying Awake\\" is a powerful book that will make any reader contemplate their relationship with God.	2005-01-16

It is a quick-paced 'fairy-tale' gone sour about an adventurous girl who yearns to be loved.<br /><br />Young Coraline and her parents have just moved into a new flat in a large, old house.  When her parents pay little attention to her, she is drawn to the locked door in the off-limits drawing room.  Behind the door is a brick wall.  But one day while her mother is out, Coraline unlocks the door to find a hallway, and a flat just like hers.  It even has her other mother and her other father, except, they're not quite the same as her parents.  Everything is better on the other side, but when Coraline's other mother wants her to stay, she gets frightened and returns home.  However, she discovers that her parents are missing, and she must return to this other flat in order to rescue them.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman has crafted a marvelous children's story that is disturbing as it is good.  Coraline's other mother is a twisted, evil creature, who will stop at nothing to keep Coraline with her.  Along the way Coraline encounters various characters both real, and twisted recreations in the 'other' world.  The illustrations by Dave McKean are excellent depictions of this nightmare that Coraline cannot escape.  As much as I enjoyed the story, I found the ending to be a bit summary.  While Coraline is brave and resourceful in conquering her other mother, I thought it was a bit too nicely buttoned up at the end (pun intended for those who have read the book).  All in all, a quick, enjoyable, spooky read for anyone with as vivid an imagination as Neil Gaiman.	2005-01-13

I am sorry I did not discover Pratchett earlier.  His writing is filled with laugh-out-loud moments and peppered with sharp insights into the ways humans function.  He has created a marvelously warped, but awfully familiar universe with his Discworld.  \\"Hogfather\\" is largely a satire about Christmas and the way that we celebrate it; but it is more importantly about the beliefs that shape who we are and the strength those beliefs have over us.<br /><br />The basis for \\"Hogfather\\" is that the Hogfather has been \\"killed\\" and Death must take over the reins in order to ensure that the sun will rise the next morning, as well as to try to bring back the Hogfather.  As he crisscrosses the world on Hogswatch Eve, he is startled by the lack of belief that he encounters in his interactions with humans.  Surely something is wrong in the universe if humans don't belief in the Hogfather and it is Death's task, along with others, to try to set things right.<br /><br />The novel includes a wide cast of characters who are believable and add to the rich tapestry of Pratchett's yarn.  We are allowed to see the story from various vantage points as we discover what is the cause behind this lack of belief.  We laugh out loud at the escapades of the Oh-God of Hangovers and the other various 'gods' who have strangely gained entrance into Discworld.  Yet the best storyline involves Susan Sto-<br /><br />Helit; as Death's grand-daughter, she would like nothing more than to live a normal life as a governess, but inevitably finds herself wrapped up in the plot to save the Hogfather and restore order to Discworld.<br /><br />Pratchett is a highly entertaining author.  He balances the wit and humor of his story with sharp (and sometimes biting) observations about life.  I look forward to more trips into Discworld.	2005-01-13

Judy Pascoe's debut novel is a southern tale of loss and love - the main characters learn how to cope wth their grief in different ways and learn how to move on after the tragedy that afflicts their life.  Pascoe uses the ten-year-old Simone as her narrator - who can only speak for her actions through a child's perspective.<br /><br />After her father's death, ten-year-old Simone is convinced that her father's spirit resides in the tree in the backyard.  By climbing the tree, she can converse with her father.  She is delighted with her find, and tells her mother as their own little secret.  Her mother takes to talking to her deceased husband, but his presence is keeping her from moving on.  Simone relates the events - some down-to-earth, some fantastically unbelievable - that occur throughout the year after her father's death.<br /><br />Pascoe has infused Simone with a powerful voice.  While only ten, she bears witness to much and at times comes across as an adult.  However, it is this very distinction that causes Pascoe's voice to seem forced - at times she tries too hard to capture the innocence and burgeoning experiences of a ten-year-old.  The reader must also suspend disbelief at the story's end, when a catastrophe of biblical proportions wreaks havoc on the family's life.  However, the novel ends with the growing perspective of Simone as she ages and looks back on the events that unfolded when she was ten-years-old.  \\"Our Father Who Art in a Tree\\" is an overall interesting and enjoyable read.	2005-01-10

He sets out to debunk many previous writings on the perpetrators of the Holocaust that leave out, in his opinion, the entire climate of Germany prior to WWII.  Germany was a vastly anitsemitic country that permitted the persecution of the Jews to occur because they believed the Jews to be 'subhuman' and 'unworthy of living'.  Goldhagen argues that most writings on the perpetrators of the Holocaust don't examine the beliefs of the vast majority of the German people.<br /><br />He undertakes various examinations of who exactly is to be held responsible for the attrocities that were committed against the Jewish nation.  He examines how deep the roots of antisemitism were before Hitler's rise to power, that ordinary Germans were willing to accept Hitler's belief that the only way to be rid of the evil Jews was wholesale slaughter.  Did ordinary Germans bat an eye at this malicious intent?  Goldhagen argues that they didn't and provides vast evidence to support his theory that Germans were not coerced into their treatment of the Jews, but abused and killed them willingly.  He examines various records that support his thesis as well and gives strong treatment to the role of police battalions, work camps and death marches.  There is plenty of evidence that demonstrates that the men and women who carried out these crimes were ordinary Germans, not necessarily Nazi party members or even supporters of Hitler.  They were memebers of a nation of people who had been brainwashed through generations of teaching that Jews were subhuman and the cause of their misery.  They truly believed that their lives would be better without Jews, and they went to any means imaginable to make that a reality.<br /><br />\\"Hitler's Willing Executioners\\" is a well-written look into the German culture that existed prior to and during WWII.  Goldhagen argues that too many people were involved in the crimes that they could not have been ignorant of the day-to-day killings of Jews, nor could they have been coerced into committing crimes they were morally opposed to - the evidence isn't there to support these prior claims.  Although well-written, Goldhagen tends to weigh his writing down in redundancy.  The opening thesis and ending conclusion are repetitive and long-winded.  \\"Hitler's Willing Executioners\\" is at its strongest when Goldhagen examines the records of the crimes against the Jews, and allows the facts to speak for themselves.  Anyone who has studied or read about the Holocaust always asks the same question - \\"How could this have happened?\\".  I believe that Goldhagen's thesis holds many of those answers.e crimes that they could not have been ignorant of the day-to-day killings of Jews, nor could they have been coerced into committing crimes they were morally opposed to - the evidence isn't there to support these prior claims.

Kafka is a masterful writer, if not always understandable or prone to explanation.  \\"The Trial\\" is a prime example of this.<br /><br />The reader is immediately introduced to Joseph K., our main character, who is awakened one morning to find himself under arrest.  Throughout the whole process of finding a lawyer, going to trail, etc..., K. is never told what he has been accused of, and neither is the reader.  Yet he is tried and convicted just the same.<br /><br />So many reviewers talk of what a great piece of existential writing this is.  However, it is also a supremely ironic look at the way the legal system works.  Kafka's description of K's trial is at times so absurd as to be unbelievable.  His settings and characters fluctutate between the two-dimensional to utterly vivid.  Throughout the novel, K. never once searches to find the cause of his guilt - he seems to willingly accept his fate, even if he is uncertain of his crime.  Perhaps that is what gives \\"The Trial\\" a sense of universality.	2004-12-31

John Logan masterfully examines the mindset of these two 'supermen' who try to commit the perfect crime, merely because they can.  His play also portrays Clarence Darrow, the man who defended them in court.<br /><br />Leopold and Loeb tried to commit the perfect murder, simply because they could.  They were young, rich and intelligent, and had no motive for killing an innocent cousin than for sheer experimentary entertainment.  Logan examines the friendship between the two teenagers, which strayed into homosexuality, and the slip-up that brought about their capture.  Clarence Darrow, as their defender, doesn't try to deny their actions - he can not do so because they readily admit to their guilt and lack of motive - but he still argues strongly and persuasively to prevent their deaths.<br /><br />John Logan's \\"Never the Sinner\\" is a brilliant look at two fascinating characters.  It's surprising that little has been done with Leopold and Loeb on the screen (despite Hitchcock's similar story \\"The Rope\\").  It is a fascinating and entertaining story that transcends the years.	2004-12-31

After her mother's death, her abusive father neglects her and she dreams of ways in which to kill him.  She eventually goes through a series of foster care situations (hence the last name of Foster), and suffers the abuse as well as the kindness of strangers.<br /><br />The novel is a brief read and perhaps that is part of its downfall.  Kaye Gibbons tries to cram too much into too little.  People have commented on old Ellen's actions and what befalls her.  Yet some of what occurs in her life is too fantastical to believe, even for a southern novel.  She suffers so much at all times, that after a while, the reader is bogged down with no chance of breaking the surface.

Life must be in quotation marks, because even though Levi survived the horrors of the concentration camp, his time there was certainly not living - only dying.  Levi begins his introduction by warning the reader that these memories may not flow in order but are recorded the way he remembers them irregardless of continuity.<br /><br />An Italian Jew, Levi was an outlaw when captured in his mid-twenties and deported to Auschwitz.  His recall for the tiniest details is amazing, but he credits the fact that he was always thinking as his main means of survival.  He describes in vivid detail what it was like to be in the railroad cars transporting them to the camp, the selection process and what one acclimated to life inside the barbed wire fences.  As a higher number, Levi is inexperienced and must learn how to endure being treated worse than animals by the Germans and his superiors.  He vivdly describes his trials in working and living, fighting over and for every little thing that could help him survive.<br /><br />Levi concludes his autobiographical account with a chapter that reads like a diary entry, reviewing his last ten days in the camp after the Germans had fled, before the camp was liberated by foreign armies.  Perhaps at times it seems that Levi is detached and lacks emotion in his writing - he doesn't allow himself to think too long about these people he misses, who were brutually snatched away from him forever.  Rather, he is straightforward in recording the facts as he remembers them, as horrifying and unbelievable as some of them are.<br /><br />The afterword, in this edition, by Philip Roth allows the reader a chance to \\"interact\\" with Primo Levi.  Roth asks him about his experiences and the influences behind his writings, which are mainly all autobiographical.

The picture of the flagraising on Iwo Jima is burned into our memories, even when we don't know the full story behind the events that led to it.  James Bradley is to be lauded for his moving personal and historical account of the most famous flag-raising in American history.<br /><br />Bradley's father never talked about his war experiences to his family.  He returned home, married, and buried the past inside him.  It wasn't until after his death in 1994 that his sons began to piece together his life history, and discovered the hero their father was, for he had served as a medic in the battle for Iwo Jima and been memorialized in bronze for his part in the flag-raising.  (What most Americans don't know, is that image that is forever captured and brandished in our memories, was the second flag-raising on Iwo Jima.)<br /><br />\\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" deftly weaves together the alternately successful and turbulent lives of the young men who raised the flag on Iwo Jima with the historical and military aspects of the very fight over this small, sulfuric island.  Bradley narrates each man's young life and what happened to him after the war was over and their bond tour duties had finished.

As its subtitle suggests, it is the tale of an unwanted daughter - the youngest of five children, whose mother died two weeks after she was born.  She lived with this stigma of causing her mother's death and being mistreated by her family for her entire life.  At times what Adeline Yen Mah endured is unbelievable.<br /><br />Yen Mah begins her memoirs after the death of her father, relating the devastating news from her cruel stepmother, that there was nothing for the children in their father's will; he had died penniless and left them nothing.  She then goes back in time, interweaving family stories with her own lifeline.  After her mother's death, her father remarried a shrewd woman, who regarded her stepchildren as less than her biological children.  She plays her stepchildren against one another and keeps a stranglehold over her husband and his relatives.  Everyone is inferior to her, even if it goes against Chinese tradition.<br /><br />While the other children of the family fail, Adeline succeeds in school but cannot gain the recognition and love from her own parents that some of her siblings have gained.  She eventually gains permission to study medicine in England, and finally finds independence and love in America.  Yet at the center of her aching heart is the hope that her family will be united and that she will be loved.  Her entire life has been spent in the anticipation that her father will applaud her efforts and demonstrate his love for her.<br /><br />Yen Mah's memoir is elegantly written and astonishingly painful.  She naturally weaves in bits of Chinese history and how it affected her family throughout their lives.  She has incredible recall into her tormented childhood that will leave readers shaking their heads in disbelief.

It is an exploration of the questions that plague men's souls about their very existence.<br /><br />We are immediately introduced to our narrator, Meursault, an Algerian Frenchman, as he relates the news of his mother's death.  Instead of being overcome with emotion, Meursault reacts to his mother's passing with little more than mere annoyance.  He then returns to his job and takes up with a young women he has admired for some time.  She becomes besotted with him, but he could care less whether he marries her or not.  For no good reason, other than wanting someone to talk to, he befriends the building's pimp and helps him fight off the men who stalk him.  In one moment of blinding thoughtlessness, Meursault commits an unthinkable murder.  He is arrested, and the rest of the book is devoted to his time in jail and his trial.<br /><br />Although Meursault is the narrator, I feel that we never get to know him.  He wanders aimlessly through life, questioning much and gaining few answers.  His observations about life in jail, and his questions about what happens after death are thoughtprovoking, but reveal little as to the true nature of his mind.  Camus is a gifted writer who explores the darkest realms of the human mind, but fails to come up with any explanation to justify his narrator's motives.  In the end, we want something more than questions - even if the answers aren't known.	2004-12-14

He has taken his extraordinary experiences and used them time and again to narrate novels that cause readers to question along with him.  \\"Dawn\\" is a novel in that same vein; Wiesel likes to ponder questions that may never be answered.<br /><br />\\"Dawn\\" tells the story of Elisha, a survivor of the concentration camps, who finds himself drawn to Palestine and to terrorist activity in the name of saving the Jewish people.  After everything that has happened to his people throughout history and after WWII, fighting is the only option for these passive people.  Elisha has been chosen to serve as executioner to a British officer, kidnapped as retribution for the kidnapping and planned execution of a Jewish rebel.  Elisha struggles with what lies ahead of him at dawn - he believes he could kill the British man if he hates him, but he cannot find any hate within himself.  In fact, Elisha struggles with the whole purpose of his mission, and the cause for which he is fighting.  He cannot imagine himself labeled as a murderer, and is fearful of making those who formed him into murderers as well.  He is utterly torn as to what he must do.<br /><br />Wiesel tells the story through flashbacks, allowing us to see Elisha's previous experiences before coming to Palestine.  We learn that he was lucky to survivie the concentration camps, and that luck may have played a hand in the lives of almost all is friends in the terrorist network.  Wiesel, as always, ponders serious questions concerning ethics, religion and morality.  He makes a poignant case for the Jewish nation, but recognizes that answers may be a long time coming.	2004-12-02

However, \\"The Five Red Herrings\\" gave me much pause and I almost laid the book aside, unfinished.  While I believe that Dorothy L. Sayers is a gifted writer, this novel is overdone in both style and story.<br /><br />\\"The Five Red Herrings\\" begins with the mysterious death of Sandy Campbell, a Scottish artist, who was disliked by almost everyone, and had received threats from all of these people in the past, making them perfect suspects.  When Lord Peter Wimsey examines the crime scene, he immediately suspects foul play (but Sayers leaves it to the reader to determine what aroused his suspicions).  The police of Kirkcudbright are then set off in all directions to follow impossible leads and various red herrings involving six local artists who are all suspects to Campbell's murder.  The story changes viewpoints numerous times as it follows one lead to another, and seems, at times, to go nowhere.  When the reader does finally reach the conclusion and the murderer is revealed, instead of ending the story, Sayers continues on in a \\"fantasy sequence\\" of sorts, with Lord Peter Wimsey recreating the crime in order to justify his theory.<br /><br />While \\"The Five Red Herrings\\" is entertaining, and manages to put the reader off the real killer, it is overdone.  In trying to capture the dialect of Scotland (not to mention Scottish residents with lisps) Sayers sets an enormous challenge for her readers to understand pages of this dialect, but translates it herself in other pages.  Had she been consistent, this might not have bugged me.  Plus, the reader gets lost in all the true and false evidence, each artists' story, and what various witnesses have to say.  Not to mention railroad timetables and the numerous theories that the policemen and detectives have put together - all of them wrong, of course, because only Lord Peter Wimsey could discover the truth.  And although I rather fancied the recreation of the crime, since we'd had so many theories floating through the novel by that point, it caused the ending and confession of the murderer to seem rather more rushed than it should have.er Wimsey could discover the truth.

While many have said how original the premise is for the book to be narrated by a character already dead, stories have been narrated by dead main characters in almost any venue of storytelling.  Nevertheless, Sebold introduces characters and a story that is vivdly drawn and uniquely told.<br /><br />\\"The Lovely Bones\\" examines the aftermath of a young girl's murder.  Sebold deftly analyzes the effect of the Susie Salmon's death on her parents, her sister and brother, the boy who was in love with her, and her killer.  We watch them struggle with her disappearance, and learn the ins and outs of what it takes for each family member to survive.  Her mother cannot cope and feels the need to escape, while her father relentlessly pursues the killer with no shred of evidence as to his guilt.  All the while, we are being told the story through the eyes of the murdered Susie, resting uneasily in a heaven that she sculpts from her own wishes.  Yet her most constant wish, to be reunited with those she loves, is impossible to grant - or is it?  The reader watches these characters grow through Susie's ever present vigil, and wait expectedly for how this story may possibly have a somewhat happy ending.<br /><br />Sebold's storytelling is vivid and quick-paced.  The Salmon family are funny and heartwrenching at the same time.  The pain of Sebold's own personal demons have found catharsis through the praising of Susie's life.  Yet I found myself rather disappointed with the ending.  After such a tremendous build-up, of grieving with this family immediately after Susie's death, I felt that the end was rushed.  And even though justice is never perfect, or perfectly served, there were some loose ends that seemed to rush too fast for some climactic, miraculous event.  I wish that Sebold had keep to the pace set by the beginning of the novel, and hadn't shortchanged the ending.tchanged the ending.	2004-11-23

Berry proves himself to be yet again a master storyteller with the power to weave prose into beautiful and sometimes elegaic poetry.  \\"A Place on Earth\\" is an incredible tribute to the power of loss, love, family and community.<br /><br />Rather than focusing on one character, or one cohesive story, Berry chooses to tell about the daily life of various town members.  Readers feel as though they are members of the community as well and have known these characters and their comings and goings for years.  There are several main characters, such as the Feltner family, who have received news that their son is missing in action and must come to terms with the fact that he may never come home.  Since Port William is a small town, the lives of every townperson is interweaved with that of their neighbors.  Everyone knows everyone, and knows their joys and sufferings almost as immediately as they do.<br /><br />A long time fan of Berry's poetry, I have loved the discovery of these two novels, and look forward to reading the rest of the Port William stories.  Wendell Berry paints his characters so vividly, and sometimes so heartbreakingly real, that we come away from the story shocked back into reality.  Berry knows the true nature of loss, the grief that accompanies it, and the hope that can be found in the most hopeless situations.  Through all the trials and tribulations of the town and its members, hope persistently prevades and will, in the end, erase the pain that has been caused.	2004-11-18

This is a common theme in novels set in future societies, where one questioning citizen is not content to accept the answers supplied by the government, and seeks out answers on their own.  Undoubtedly, their actions will cause them persecution, as they learn that there is more to life than what the government has to offer.<br /><br />In \\"The Last Martyr\\", we meet Alden - a man who works for a living recording human births, but who is unable to conceive a child with his wife.  The redundancy of his job and joyless, unfulfilling marriage cause him to question if there is more to life than what has been proffered.  Citizens in this post-WWIII world must attend clearing sessions that guarantee the free thought or religion no longer exists in the \\"civilized\\" world.  When Alden's mentor realizes that he is questioning the very fundamentals of their society, he sends Alden on a journey to the \\"uncivilized\\" land to see how good life is.<br /><br />Alden visits the uncivilized land, with Caley (a guide meant to keep tabs on Alden and make sure he doesn't stray further than he already has) and becomes fascinated with a religion known as Christianity.  Religion has been outlawed by his government, since no proof has ever been given for the existence of God.  Alden returns to the civilized world and begins to spread his newfound faith through underground meetings for fear the government will find out.<br /><br />\\"The Last Martyr\\" is a quick-paced novel with a realistic vision of what the future may hold.  Despite the precepts of the government, and the clash between the \\"civilized/uncivilized\\" worlds, Mackowicz offers hope for these turbulent times.  The characters are well developed and the novel is peppered with witty asides and clever reimaginings.  I look forward to the next book.	2004-11-18

He spins tales that are wildly funny and entertaining, and yet manages to squeeze in a lesson.  (Even if that lesson is that animals are stupid or to never listen to what a fish says.)<br /><br />\\"Borgel\\" tells the story of Melvin Spellbound and his uncle Borgel.  Borgel is of no clear relation and shows up one day out of the blue.  He stays in his room for weeks at a time and the family children may only enter through invitation, wearing a tie.  One night Melvin is invited to Borgel's room and he believes that they are running away.  They wind up on an adventure through space-time-and-the-other.<br /><br />Pinkwater peppers his story with hilarity mixed with reality.  Borgel and Melvin's space travels are delightfully funny and deepen our appreciation of the wide cast of characters, including Fafner the dog and Freddie the Grivnizoid, as they search space and Hell for the Great Popsicle.  Throughout all his whimsy and witty words, Pinkwater truly makes us care about the characters and wraps up a story that may seem to have wandered so far that there would be no coming back.  Just like what would happen in space travel, if the Dorbzeldge was to drift past the road barriers.	2004-11-10

It has the depth of a large work of fiction, but is intricately told in a short amount of pages.  Michel Quint crafts his story through flashback, demonstrating the powerful role memory plays in shaping our lives.<br /><br />\\"In Our Strange Gardens\\" is the recollection of the author - the memory of his family and the secrets that shape the lives of his father and his uncle.  During World War II, his father and uncle were held prisoners and forced to make terrifying decisions that would affect their lives as well as the lives of others.  Quint's characters are vividly drawn, brief and poignant character studies that examine the true nature of all human beings.<br /><br />The story surprisingly comes full circle, as the author learns the truth behind his father's life, and that of his uncle's.  Once I was finished reading, I was tempted to start over again to see where this circle had all begun.  It is a tender and sweet memorial to the ties that bind us to family and the decisions that shape our lives.	2004-11-07

James is in top form with her latest Adam Dalgliesh mystery, \\"The Murder Room\\".  James' mysteries are always well-laid out and intricately woven with a wide cast of characters.  She likes to begin her novels introducing all the characters in the novel, giving motives and means to each one, making the puzzle of who's guilty and who's innocent ever harder to figure out.<br /><br />The title room is set in the fictional DuPayne Museum - a museum dedicated to the interwar years and doomed to close if all three trustees, the DuPayne children, don't agree to keep it open.  And when Neville DuPayne, the one trustee who wants to close the museum, is brutally murdered on the premises, Adam Dalgliesh and his special investigation team is called in to solve the case.  As they interact with the lives of those who are a part of the museum, Dalgliesh and his team find themselves investigating what appears to be a series of (...)murders, mimicking the cases that are incorporated as exhibits in the Murder Room at the museum.  All this while, Dalgliesh is distracted from the task at hand due to Emma Lavenham (whom readers met in \\"Death in Holy Orders\\").  Their developing relationship has constantly been interrupted due to Dalgliesh's job commitments, and he fears that she won't love him enough to stick around.<br /><br />As always, James' narrative shifts focus between her numerous, vivid characters, and is peppered with literary and philosophical references.  For those who are wary enough to pay attention, she even gives us the keys to figuring out the puzzle as to who the murderer is.  If there's one downfall to \\"The Murder Room\\" I believe it's that enough time isn't given to Adam and Emma's relationship.  She appears at the beginning and end, and intermittenly in Adams' thoughts: since she is an important development in Adam's life, readers want to get to know her better - especially by the end of the book.  I can't wait for the further developments that this entails...	2004-11-07

As a Jew who survived the Holocaust and horrors of the concentration camps when he was but a child, he has spent his life questioning the very nature of his faith and his fellow human beings.  In \\"Conversations With Elie Wiesel\\" readers are given the opportunity to hear his viewpoint on a wide range of topics that concern America, and the entire world, today.<br /><br />These conversations have been honed from numerous interviews with Richard D. Heffner, moderator of the public television show \\"The Open Mind.\\"  Together these two men discuss religion, tolerance, hate, compassion, capital punishment - almost every so-called hot button that exists in the political, social and moral concerns of our world.  Elie Wiesel proves himself to be a thoroughly intelligent man, who raises questions even while recognizing that some may never be answered.  His distinct experiences and his Jewish faith play a role in all that he says or does.<br /><br />These conversations are interspersed with interludes that give true Wiesel fans insights into the inner workings of his mind.  Wiesel argues for the necessary role of compassion in human interactions.  We need to care about our brothers, in spite of our differences, if there is to be any peace and understanding within our world.  He holds out hope for the day when everyone could come together and put aside all the differences and squabbles that separate us and tear us apart.  This truly is a thought-provoking read for anyone interested in religion, philosophy, and the fate of our world.	2004-11-04

Yet Lawhead's storytelling is such that one does not need to read previous works to enjoy this climactic segment of this series.  \\"Arthur\\" incorporates both the characters and the mysteries of the two books that precede it, and breathes new life into an oft-told tale.<br /><br />The story of King Arthur remains such a legend because there is so much mystery around it.  Other reviewers have written against the fact that Lawhead doesn't include certain elements of the better-known legends into his series: that isn't a bad thing, but rather helps him give Arthur a new, and in my opinion, better, voice.  Lawhead also draws upon his own faith and demonstrates how the burgeoning Christian faith sprouted and flourished under Arthur's reign in the Isle of the Mighty.  The reader follows Arthur's life from teenager to veteran king, and from warrior to peace-maker.  We learn of Arthur's trials and triumphs by three men who are in his inner-circle and have watched him over the course of his life.<br /><br />Lawhead is a gifted writer, who can describe entire worlds and vistas that the reader can vivdly imagine.  His characters are always well-rounded and brought to life through believable diaglogue and Lawhead's insatiable quest for historical accuracy.  Although Arthur needed to unite Britain in order to have peace in the land, the book often seems bogged down by battle after battle; there are only so many ways to make each battle different from the next, and I sometimes found myself skimming through these skirmishes in order to get back to the story.	2004-10-30

She has a knack for creating entire worlds that her readers are loath to leave.  Her characters are real people, whose lives we are involved with; we know each of her creations intimately.  We struggle alongside each of them, and rejoice in their successes.<br /><br />Binchy's latest novel, \\"Nights of Rain and Stars\\", takes place on the small Greek island of Aghia Anna.  Four travelers are thrown together with the local people, when tragedy strikes the island.  Each one finds comfort in the others, and all of them are running away from something.  Thomas, the American literature professor, is fearful of his son's relationship with his new stepdad.  Elsa, the beautiful German, has run away from the man she loves after learning something dreadful about his past.  David, the quiet English boy, has run away from having to take over his father's business.  And Fiona, an Irish nurse, has run off to be with her no-good boyfriend, blinded by love and unwilling to listen to anyone's advice.  All of them converge on the island of Aghia Anna, and are inseparable friends within days.  They tear each other apart, and build one another up at the same time.<br /><br />Yet \\"Night of Rain and Stars\\" is not Binchy's best.  The characters seem a little too familiar, as if we've read about them in past books.  Gone are the meandering chapters and vivid minor characters who populate Binchy's other novels.  The entire book has the feel of a collection of short stories sewn together with some fragile thread.  I have read every novel Maeve Binchy has written and buy them as soon as they come out, even in hardcover.  Although an enjoyable read for any fan, I feel that I could've waited for this book to come out as a paperback.	2004-10-12

Carr takes his readers into the darkest depths of New York's nightlife, as he spins a web of calculated and sadistic murders.  The hunt is on for a killer like no other - a serial killer who shows no signs of slowing down.<br /><br />Caleb Carr has set his tale amongst a rich, historical background.  Characters include players from history, like John Pierpont Morgan, and Theodore Roosevelt (when he was police commissioner of New York City).  Against this cast of real characters, Carr has created an astounding team of \\"detectives\\" who use unorthodox methods to track down a killer that no one seems willing to stop.  The story is narrated by John Moore, a newspaper reporter who tells of the exploits of Dr. Laszlo Kriezler, an alienist who has varied experience with killers and the mentally insane.  Together with three others, these men race to uncover the secrets that surround each killing, and try to discover the man who is at the heart of such brutal murders.<br /><br />Carr's characters are vividly drawn, and realistically written.  He gives a reasonably real voice to those real characters, and weaves them into a delightfully and surprisingly fast-paced book (at just shy of 600 pages).  Using more \\"modern\\" methods, such as finger-printing, forensic examination and psychological profiling, Carr has turned a modern day murder spree into a believable historical account.  Although the ending seems a little rushed, after such a long investigation by the team, the story is intelligent and an enjoyable read.	2004-10-11

In his works, he struggles to answer nearly impossible questions: why was it the fate of the Jews to die and why did they seem to accept that fate without a fight?  \\"The Fifth Son\\" is a philosophical testament that seeks the answers to those questions, but also imaginatively examines the bond between father and son.<br /><br />As usual with Wiesel's novels, the reader is transported from the present to the past numerous times.  We meet Rueven Tamiroff, a librarian in New York, a Jew who survived the Holocaust, and a father who cannot communicate with his unnamed son.  His son desperately searches for the keys to his father's behavior, searching out stories of his past through every possible means.  When he finally uncovers the truth about his father's past that is destroying his present reality, the son becomes obsessed with setting the record straight.  The son's travels take him back to Germany and into the darkest recesses of encroaching madness.  Wiesel's characters are vividly written, intelligent and fragile creatures.<br /><br />Wiesel takes his readers on a philosophical tour of Nazi torture and the revenge that assauged those Jews who survived WWII, as well as the guilt they felt for surviving when so many others did not.  He speaks eloquently of the displacement of Jews who moved to America, as well as the anger of the younger German generation who are blamed for the sins of the older generation.  The questions he raises are hard to answer; mainly because answers are yet to be found that would satisfy Wiesel.	2004-10-02

All of these colorful characters are connected to one another for two reasons; they are immigrants from Russia and they have all known and loved a dying man by the name of Alik.  In his last days of life in August of 1991, they gather to say their goodbyes, and reflect on their own lives.<br /><br />The prospect of death is a natural occasion for people to analyze their life - its triumphs and mistakes.  And that is exactly what Ulitskaya's characters do.  They ponder over their pasts and presents, and we progressively learn what their connection to the dying man was.  We discover their passions and their fears, their frustrations and their hopes, their dreams and their realities.  All are beautifully written and played out by believable, vivid characters.<br /><br />Yet \\"The Funeral Party\\" reads less as a novel than a series of character vignettes, exploring the inner-workings of each player in this sad, final saga of Alik's life.  The connection between them is loose, but perhaps it is lost in the translation.  However, overall Ulitskaya offers a wonderful and odd portrait of a wonderfully odd familiy of Russian immigrants.	2004-09-29

The fact that Miller wove factual history with the hysteria of his day makes \\"The Crucible\\" all the more chilling.<br /><br />Throughout the course of the play, a collection of teenage girls 'confess' to having seen various women and men of the town of Salem with the devil.  This hysteria sweeps over the town as even the authorities fall under the sway of these lying young girls.  Caught in the middle of these hysteronics is the Proctor family - John and Elizabeth, who have struggled in the past, but are trying to rebuild their marriage.  They are rent apart when Elizabeth is suspected of being a witch.  John hopes to clear his wife's name, but only manages to make matters worse for both of them.<br /><br />The hysteria experienced in Salem is chilling in the fact that these sorts of witch hunts occur today, in all different areas of society.  \\"The Crucible\\" shows how easily people can be swayed, with the barest of evidence, to believe something that is false.  Miller's play is extremely well-written and informative, and almost too frighteningly real.	2004-09-20

Barron has realistically recreated Austen's time period, playing the editor to Jane's \\"found\\" diaries that record these events, and peppering her narrative with footnotes that inform the reader about Austen's day.<br /><br />With the third book of the series, Barron has improved upon her style.  At times it almost seems a bit of a stretch to capture the language used in Austen's day, but Barron is comfortable in Jane's mindset.  She does the author justice in thought and deed - one can very easily imagine Jane adventuring to discover the twists and turns of the mysteries that fill Barron's pages.  And if there is a slight resemblance to some of Austen's published novels, well, we know when the idea/observation struck her.<br /><br />The third book introduces us to a murder mystery, filled with numerous twists and turns.  Once again we find Jane in the companionship of Lord Harold Trowbridge, as they try to solve a mystery that was committed at his mother's house and that throws suspicion on his family, as well as on various suitors who would claim his niece's hand in marriage.  Together, Lord Harold and Jane uncover the murderer while the law remains impotent to do so.  I very much look forward to whatever mischief she may set her sights upon in book four.	2004-09-19

Surely this is one of her best Dalgliesh mysteries.<br /><br />The expert witness in the title refers to Dr. Edwin Lorrimer, a much respected forensic biologist who leads a solitary life in rural England.  Although admired by colleagues for his work and intelligence, Lorrimer is severly disliked as a person.  The introductory book introduces us to several characters that inhabit Chevisham and their various reasons for disliking Dr. Lorrimer - and perhaps even their motives for killing him.  When he is found dead in his laboratory, all signs point to someone on the inside, and Adam Dalgliesh is called in to piece together the mystery surrounding his death.<br /><br />The cast of characters is well written and believable; their supporting roles are thoroughly realized and move the plot along at a brisk pace.  Dalgliesh is a master at tracking the little things that move humans to murder and the reader follows in his footsteps, searching for the clues even as he seeks them out.  As usual, there is a hint of melancholy in Dalgliesh's actions and in the novel's bittersweet ending; the reader has come to empathize with the vivid characters who may or may not be guilty.	2004-09-12

'Ghost Soldiers' by Hampton Sides is exactly one of those stories.  It tells of the fatal fall of Bataan during WWII and the rescue mission that took place to save American POWs from Japanese death camps.  Yet these events, for all the fanfare they received at the time, have been sadly overlooked by other instances in the same war.<br /><br />'Ghost Soldiers' is a harrowing story; really, two stories.  After a gruesomely explicit prologue, Sides splits his time between the fall of Bataan, the death march and life at the POW camp with the story of the U.S. Rangers attempt to free the camp in 1945.  We see both stories build at the same time and as the narrative builds towards the end, the two stories combine into an incredible climax.  These POWs survived incredible torture and various sordid diseases and were eventually rescued under almost miraculous circumstances.  It's staggering just to imagine all that they had gone through.<br /><br />Sides has done a brilliant job at telling a too-little known story.  He uses a narrative style to interweave the painful accounts of former POWs and Rangers into this timeline.  The British were forced to surrender Bataan (especially due to the circumstances of Pacific warfare after the bombing of Pearl Harbor) and become prisoners of a culture who had no regard for prisoners; death was the only option.  And for too many soldiers, that was their only option.  It is a shame that their stories have been forgotten.	2004-09-08

O'Brien once again brings us to the topic that perpetuates his other novels - the role that memory plays in shaping our entire lives.<br /><br />In 'July, July' he describes a college class of 1969 - what they were like then, what they're like now; what went wrong, what went right.  As a generation coming of age during the Vietnam War, O'Brien's narrative is peppered with the realities that war brought into the  lives of these young, carefree college kids.  We are introduced to a wide cast of characters, gradually learning more about them, as O'Brien fluctuates between the present and flashbacks to the past.  Even though the novel lacks a central, sequential plot, the stories of these characters flow right along, as they analyze their lives and try to discover who they are.<br /><br />O'Brien imaginatively uses the backdrop of a class reunion to examine old wounds and fresh hopes.  These characters are all hurting in some way - either due to lost loves, the death of fellow classmates, divorce, or falling into a mediocrity they never expected for themselves.  The entire cast of characters are vividly drawn, if not always believable, and one cannot help but root for them and their reunion with memories and old friends.  For a generation that experienced such upheaveal and loss, O'Brien strains to make sense of that in 'July, July'.  And this time, his characters can get past the bad memories to begin their lives anew.	2004-08-31

Although not typically a fan of 'chick-lit', I was drawn to Nathan's previous books due to the Jane Austen angle, and I wasn't surprised to discover that I liked her with her own plotline.  'The Nanny' is a quick, enjoyable read that you'll find hard to put down.<br /><br />'The Nanny' introduces us to Jo Green, a twenty-three year old woman from the English countryside, who is dissatisfied with her life but doesn't know what to do.  Impulsively, she answers an ad for a nanny position in London and gladly accepts to work for the lovely but dysfunctional Fitzgerald family.  Jo almost immediately regrets this decision - it's her first time away from home, she's in charge of three kids (aged 4, 6, and 8), and an entire house.  Life looks better for Jo though, when she meets Pippa, a fellow nanny who teaches her how to rule the household, and not be ruled by them.  Things take a turn for the worse however, when Josh, a son from the husband's first marriage, moves in and takes a dislike to Jo.  The feeling is mutual, or is it?<br /><br />'The Nanny' showcases Nathan's trademark wit and clever asides.  Jo is a well-drawn character, although not entirely like her namesake (Josephine from 'Little Women').  Even though predictable and almost seemingly made for a romantic-comedy screenplay, Nathan rises above the vapid fluff of numerous chick-lit novels and sets the pace for some truly talented writing.	2004-08-28

It is their legacies that led the young John McCain to the Naval Academy and to a career in the Navy.  Yet the legacy of these two men is wrapped up in morals, values and patriotism - exactly what makes John McCain the great leader that he is.<br /><br />This book is divided into three sections.  It begins with the stories of McCain's grandfather, an admiral in the Navy who fought in WWII.  His grandfather is depicted as a true seaman, complete with the language.  He then goes on to talk about his father, another Navy admiral, who went on to serve as commander of the Pacific and entire naval force.  Greatly influenced by his grandfather and father, McCain received a commission in the Navy and sought to distinguish himself through serving the United States in war.  Unfortunately, that war happened to be Vietnam.<br /><br />The third section of the book deals with McCain's experiences at the Naval Academy and his time as a prisoner of war in Hanoi.  McCain recognizes that because of his 'celebrity' status (due to his father's top position), he wasn't mistreated as severely as other prisoners.  His accounts of the heroism of these men are extraordinary; the pain they had to endure and the pain that broke them.  POWs were forced to make fake confessions, to listen to their former comrades condemn them in public, and to pretend that they were being treated humanely for the world audience.<br /><br />Throughout his political career, McCain has been known as a POW of Vietnam, yet this is not how he distinguishes himself.  He took what he learned from his time as a prisoner and set about living his life, grateful for his experiences.  At times the book fluctuates in time periods, which can get rather confusing.  Besides the stories of his grandfather and father, and his time as a POW, McCain and co-author Mark Salter, weave in the world events - what went wrong in Vietnam, what could have gone right.  McCain lets his opinion be known, but recognizes that terrible responsibility that comes in waging war.  He has proven himself to be a hero worthy of admiration and the responsibility of leadership.co-author Mark Salter, weave in the world events - what went wrong in Vietnam, what could have gone right.

In my first read, I completely fell for Commander Adam Dalgliesh of the New Scotland Yard, a sensitive detective with a poetic soul and a tragic past.  'Devices and Desires', however, does not focus on Dalgliesh.  While he is settling his late aunt's estate in Norfolk, he must sit on the sidelines as Inspector Rickards tries to solve the murders that keep occuring in the small, closeknit community of Larksoken.<br /><br />The story begins with a brilliant introduction of a killing in the making.  We get to see the serial killer, The Whistler, at work as he tracks his latest victim and kills her.  Upon arriving at Larksoken, which has as its backyard the controversial atomic power station, Dalgliesh finds himself a sounding board for Inspector Rickards and is slowly drawn into the mystery surrounding the inhabitants of the town.  Throughout the course of the novel numerous characters are introduced.  They are well-rounded and vividly drawn, and when a copy-cat murder strikes too close to home, they are even further developed through their alibis and lies.<br /><br />Since this is not Dalgliesh's case, he does not play a large role in the novel.  We are told the story through every characters' eyes and must try to piece together a mystery so tightly woven with tasteful clues spread throughout; the reader will almost feel like one of the inspectors trying to crack the case.  In the end, however, Dalgliesh cannot remain on the sidelines and involves himself with solving the case.  P.D. James has a brilliant knack for creating characters who seem to come alive and her skills at spinning webs of suspense are to be admired.  She keeps her readers guessing until the end; and even if the end may seem a little contrived at times, Ms. James recognizes this and has a little laugh at our/her expense.	2004-08-18

His wit is as sharp as ever and he continues to cleverly tie in various characters/scenarios from several works of literature. The world he has created for Thursday Next is a treat for any bibliophile who has ever dreamed of being able to enter their favorite work of literature.<br /><br />'Something Rotten' finds Thursday Next tired of hiding out in the Book World, so she returns home in order to have her erradicated husband un-erradicated. This isn't as simple as it may seem, and Thursday is forced with defending herself from various attempts on her life, resolving a coup in 'Hamlet', and stopping the ruthless Yorrick Kaine, a fictional character, from becoming a vicious dictator in the real world (well, a Nextian world). She also has to take care of her two-year-old son Friday, get her job back at SpecOps, and most importantly of all, prevent an armageddon from destroying the world. These might seem like insurmountable tasks for the ordinary detective; but as a literary detective, Next is more than equipped for whatever comes her way, real or imagined.<br /><br />Fforde has created an entire world for Thursday Next and is comfortable in her shoes. As she travels between the real and the written world, Fforde's imagination is vibrant and alive, painting an unusual depiction of what really goes on in the books we read. He has given new voices and perspectives to beloved literary characters and has established himself as a force to be reckoned with, in both the literary and 'real' worlds.	2004-08-14

'Brideshead Revisited' is an extremely well-written book that thoroughly tells the story of Charles Ryder, an English officer who is forced to recall the happiest and saddest moments of his life.  Through his memories, we learn of the wealthy and eccentric Marchmain family and the formative role they played in the narrator's life.<br /><br />Charles Ryder begins his memoirs when, as a soldier in WWII, he finds himself requisitioning the old manor home of the Marchmain family.  He immediately recalls his first encounters with the family - the mysterious and ultra-stylish Sebastian, whom he encounters while at Oxford, a pretentious young man who carries around a stuffed bear and has a propensity to drink.  Sebastian is hesitant to introduce Charles to his family, for fear they will charm him so much that he will lose him as a friend for himself.  But Charles does meet, and is charmed by, the Marchmain family, ingratiating himself into every aspect of their life.  He quickly becomes a mainstay with the family and is called upon in times of great stress - when Sebastian's propensity to drink gets him expelled and causes him to escape his demons by running away.  Despite losing his friend, through the years, Charles remains connected with the Marchmains in varying degrees of intimacy.<br /><br />'Brideshead Revisited' is a stylish and well-written saga of one man's journey to discover himself; he seeks out what he desires in others, and at the end of his journey is brought to tears by his remembrances of everything he has lost.  The novel is not only a family saga, but also raises deep questions of faith, especially pertaining to Catholicism.  As an agnostic, Charles ridicules the Marchmain's devout adherence to a faith system he finds mystical; and in the end, he must lose the Marchmain family because he cannot reconcile himself to their system of beliefs.  Charles would rather find his own system of beliefs, exactly what he's been searching for throughout the entire novel, seeking it through school, painting, and relationships, but to no avail.of beliefs, exactly what he's been searching for throughout the entire novel, seeking it through school, painting, and relationships, but to no avail.	2004-08-01

In this drama he puts to good use his vivid characterization and his ability to capture the most intense emotions of humans.  It is a quick and pleasureable read about the last days of a fading salesman.<br /><br />The play tells the story of the famous Willy Loman, a salesman past his prime, who has taken to speaking to characters who do not exist for the others.  In the midst of ordinary conversation, Willy will experience these breaks with reality which throw the person he is speaking to in reality into a state of confusion.  He is a man who is tired of living and wants to provide for his family; a task he finds impossible in a world he no longer recognizes.  Estranged from his elder son Biff because of a past indiscretion, Willy and Biff argue throughout the play, each trying to be something other than what they actually are.<br /><br />As 'Death of a Salesman' builds to its climactic, tragic end, Miller pulls out all the stops.  The revelations and confrontations are marked with astonishing insight and driven by passionate emotions.  His characters cannot escape the destinies they have created for themselves which all leads to Willy's final desperate and misguided sacrifice.	2004-07-31

Everyone has read 'Jane Eyre' by Charlotte or 'Wuthering Heights' by Emily, but few have read 'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' or 'Agnes Grey'. While similar in style to her sisters' writings, Anne's writing has the proclivity to explore the religious side of her characters and their experiences. Her characters find great solace through their faith in God.<br /><br /> 'Agnes Grey' is the 'diary' of a young governess. Its title character sets out to portray the squalid conditions that governesses worked under - how they were less than servants in the eyes of families whose children could do no wrong; but if they did do wrong, it was the fault of the governess and not the parent. As someone who works with children, it is no surprise that parents do not want to recognize their own fault in their children's misbehavior. Agnes' life is marked with poverty and fear that the only man she loves does not return her feelings.<br /><br /> Throughout the novel, the reader is treated to the inner thoughts of the main character, as she pours out her soul (and her numerous tears) onto the page. 'Agnes Grey' is a quick and straight-forward read, with little romanticizing; Bronte's narrator is quick to point out that there are certain things that the reader would not want to read and therefore she has left them out. Overall the book is a telling look at what life must have been like for one of the Bronte sisters - three sisters of a poor curate with few prospects for fortune other than through their writing. Yet the summation is a bit too cursory for a 'tell-all' look at Agnes Grey's life. She says few words, when more are wanted to fully conclude her story.	2004-07-27

However, &quot;In My Hands&quot; is a noticeable exception. It is a harrowing memoir of one young woman, who finds herself drawn to helping the less fortunate Jews, even if it means death.<br /><br /> &quot;In My Hands&quot; tells the story of Irene Gut Opdyke, a displaced Polish Catholic, who experiences life and death during World War II. When Poland is split between both Germany and Russia, she finds herself without a home, and far away from her family at the age of seventeen. She hides in the forest with the remnants of the Polish army, is suspected of being a spy, and endures numerous tortures, but always miraculously survives. God has a purpose for her, even if that keeps her from finding the family that she desperately misses. She finds herself working for the Germans, and because of her Aryan looks, holds substantial sway with her employers. When she witnesses the German's &quot;solution&quot; to the &quot;Jewish problem&quot; she is outraged and takes extreme measures to protect them, even hiding them in the basement of the house of her German employer, an officer of the Wehrmacht.<br /><br /> &quot;In My Hands&quot; is an incredible story. It was written with Jennifer Armstrong, who has placed herself into Irene's story in order to breathe new life into a remarkable account of courage that never quit.

When Daniel Dorsey's parents are killed in a car crash, he is taken in by his grandparents and raised by them along with various aunts and uncles, his whole extended Irish immigrant family.  The story is set in Chicago during the 1950s, a time when innocence was on the cusp of being lost in an ever-changing city.<br />Michael Raleigh paints a vivid picture of young Danny's life.  At age seven, he is an intrepid narrator, eagerly questioning everyone about life.  At the same time, however, he is also suffering from losing his parents and his fears that all those whom he loves will be taken away from him as well.  During these times the reader recognizes the adult voice in Danny - his childlike perceptions of the adults who populate his world are spiced with the wisdom only age can bring.<br />&quot;In the Castle of the Flynns&quot; is a well-written novel, that often reads as a collection of vignettes involving the Flynns and the Dorseys.  Raleigh's characters are realistically voiced and believable.  The reader is immediately wrapped up in the happenings of this eclectic Irish-Catholic family who never lose sight of what young Danny needs.  At times laugh-out-loud funny, at others bittersweet with sentiment, &quot;In the Castle of the Flynns&quot; is a thoroughly enjoyable read about the bonds of love and family.	2004-07-20

Many of these myths are exactly that - they are exaggerated, convulted stories of possible happenings.  It is remarkable that one of those stories, which is almost too improbable to be real, actually occurred; and that is what Stanley Weintruab recounts in &quot;Silent Night&quot;.<br />&quot;Silent Night&quot; is the exploration of the Christmas Truce of WWI, which occurred in December 1914.  On both sides of the fighting, soldiers called for an uneasy truce in order to celebrate Christmas.  It was time for celebration, not for fighting; not to mention the fact that the war had reached a terrible stalemate along the Western front, and no real progress was being made.  During those few glorious Christmas days, soldiers on each side participated in gift exchanges, games of football and the clearing of &quot;No Man's Land&quot; so that they could bury the bodies of their fallen comrades.<br />Weintraub weaves the tale of the 1914 Christmas truce with eye-witness accounts from soldiers, and supplements it with pictures and drawings that prove it actually happened.  Sometimes his storytelling fluctuates too much; numerous accounts are given and it can be confusing as to the time frame and setting in regards to the whole picture.  At the end of his portrayal of this remarkable event, Weintraub offers up a &quot;What if...&quot; chapter - while this may seem irrelevant due to the facts of WWI, it is always a question that will remain in our minds.  Weintraub offers some startling possibilities and does justice to a truth of mythic proportions.	2004-07-15

Although an American, having spent twenty odd years in England gives Bryson a unique perspective on what makes America, and Americans, tick.  &quot;I'm a Stranger Here Myself&quot; is a collection of essays Bryson wrote for an English audience; but they lack none of their charm when read by an Anglophile American.<br />&quot;I'm a Stranger Here Myself&quot; is and odd conglomeration of essays that deal with a range of topics: small-town America, shopping, the inconvenience of our numerous &quot;conveniences&quot;, and several entries on his own ineptness when it comes to technology.  In each of his essays Bryson is a bit of a wanderer, starting in one direction, only to go off on a tangent.  Usually he's able to bring himself back to the point, and can even poke fun at himself for doing so.  His wanderings are what sets his style and what generates the largest laughs or head shakes of disbelief.<br />While Bryson is at times critical of what happens in America, &quot;I'm a Stranger Here Myself&quot; is a loving portrait of a revered country.  However, Bryson's perspective is one of a man living a blessed life.  He now resides in a virtually crime-free small New Hampshire town and grew up in small-town Iowa.  His essays sometimes lack the experiences that growing up or residing in other areas might offer.

Any book/story/movie that deals with teenagers' coming-of-age angst has undoubtedly been influenced by Salinger's dual portrayl of the troubled Holden, at once insanely immature; at the other, wise beyond his years.<br />&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; gives us a weekend in the life of its main character, a troubled sixteen-year-old who has just been thrown out of another school for failing all subjects, except English because he is a master at writing compositions.  He also credits himself to be a master at lying and always finds himself spinning wonderfully impossible yarns to strangers.  Holden is disaffected and somewhat emotionally withdrawn.  Through his flashbacks to the past, we learn about the death of his brother Allie and his experiences at other schools.  Allie's death has affected him more than even Holden realizes and he finds himself unable to connect to anything or anyone permanently.  And when he finds himself kicked out of school again, he fears having to confront his parents at home so he goes on a whirlwind trip to New York City, which only enhances his feelings of loneliness and isolation.<br />Salinger has created a prototype character with Holden Caulfield.  He is witty and wise, but at the same time foolishly naive and over-sensitive.  Yet his insights into the adult world and the phonie ways that people behave are bitterly correct.  Holden knows at once what he doesn't want to do or be, but couldn't tell you what he wants to do.  And when he realizes what that is, it truly is one of the most eloquently written pieces of dialogue in American literature.	2004-07-10

Through the very first pages of \\"The Arctic Incident\\" I was instantly transported into Colfer's imaginative world, and underworld, peopled with fairies, goblins, and an evil boy genius, who seems to have matured.  I was pleased to discover that the second book lived up to the impression that the first one made.<br />\\"The Arctic Incident\\" begins with a look at the young Artemis Fowl stuck in a dreadful boarding school, \\"killing off\\" counselor after counselor that tries to asses what is wrong with him.  Meanwhile, Captain Holly Short of the LEPrecon police force has to deal with a smuggling problem that involves humans and the intelligence-challenged goblins.  Believing Artemis to be the culprit, she kidnaps him and his mountain of a bodyguard Butler, to little avail.  They are not the suppliers but they make a deal with Holly.  They will help her discover who the smugglers are if she will help Artemis find his father, who is being held hostage in the Arctic Circle.  Holly is not looking forward to helping Artemis after their encounter in Book One, but she has no other choice.  Their journey to fulfill both of their missions is filled with tension and humor and further explores the inner-workings of these two fascinating characters.<br />Colfer has created an imaginative world that is peopled with rich and vivid characters, and witty asides to the reader.  Artemis is a boy genius trying to surpress his evil ways in order to find his father and turn over a new leaf; his struggle is that of any teenager's angst.  But the best characters are those who inhabit the lower elements; Foaly the centaur, Captain Short, Commander Root, and best of all, the returning Mulch Diggums, the thief dwarf.  And while the Artemis Fowl books may be labeled as children's books, you don't have to be a child to enjoy the wry humor that Colfer dishes out.	2004-07-10

Dalgliesh travels to St. Anselm's in order to uncover any &quot;foul play&quot; surrounding the boy's death; what he finds is an ever-widening circle of deaths, each related to the other.  It's an inside job and Dalgliesh must figure out who the killer is before more are found dead.  And since it's an inside job, everyone is supsect, even the priests.<br />&quot;Death in Holy Orders&quot; is a quick-paced, sometimes formulaic detective novel.  What sets it apart from others is the characterization.  Adam Dalgliesh is well-written and entirely believable.  The cast of supporting characters, which are numerous, all receive their due and their back stories contribute fully to the plot at hand.

I know Shaffer's play is largely based on speculation, and I wanted some facts.  Since this biography was generally well reviewed and praised, I believed I would be of the same opinion.  However, Solomon has taken perhaps the most outrageous character of classical music and placed him in the most tame and boring of tales.<br />Solomon's biography is thoroughly researched.  He is profoundly adept at analyzing Mozart's music and the various shifts as the composer searches for his own unique style.  Even if you are not familiar with the pieces mentioned, you can still recognize the genius of the notes on the page, provided for you.  And even his analyses of Mozart's character, although mere speculation, are well-written and thought-provoking.<br />However, Solomon spends too much time on the seemingly insignificant.  Yes, Mozart's relationship with his father is important in the course of Mozart's development, but do we really need the speculation as to what Leopold Mozart &quot;may have earned&quot; on their musical travels?  Too often Solomon's research reads like a laundry list of gifts, events, and musical compositions.  The reader hardly knows what to make of Mozart by the end of this biography; since Solomon himself never presents this mythic character in a clear light.  Upon finishing, I felt I had learned more about Mozart's father than I had about the composer himself.  In wanting to give us the entire &quot;life&quot; story of Mozart, he ironically gives us a biography that is lacking exactly that - life.	2004-07-04

Now What?!: Life After the Wedding Dress	Books	4	6	9	N	N	not for all brides (or wives)	I was recently given this book as a gift at a wedding shower.  As a bride-to-be I thought it might be fun to take a spin on the humorous side of post-wedding life, i.e. what happens after the honeymoon is over.  Jenny Lee claims that no one ever told her what life was like after the wedding and so she set out to write a book to right the wrong she felt.  &quot;I Do.  I Did.  Now What?!&quot; is at times funny; at other times the reader feels like the eavesdropper of a dirty-laundry airing session.<br />Lee sets out by telling the history of her relationship with her husband and fills her memoirs with both humorous and bland anecdotes.  Several of these are ones that readers can relate to - coping with the adjustments of living with another person and their not-so-neat habits.  And the book does have several chuckle moments.  Yet perhaps because I've never been the stereotypical girl who loves to shop and loves shoes above all else, I found Lee's &quot;humor&quot; sometimes ingratiating.  And that also means that this book isn't a &quot;one size fits all&quot;; not all women are like what is portrayed in Lee's writing.<br />&quot;I Do.  I Did.  Now What?!&quot; is a quick, sometimes witty read, something like a memoir in the chick-lit genre.  Yet in spite of her dedication to her husband, I found myself feeling sorry for him sometimes.  In several of her anecdotes she mentions how her husband takes her and all that she does for him for granted.  I doubt she realizes that her husband must also be a saint in order to put up with some of her habits and idiosyncracies that grated on my nerves just reading about them.  There's no new, big stand-out advice that hasn't been said at one time or another; yet Jenny Lee sometimes manages to make the old somewhat entertaining.	2004-06-30
US	49332535	R25ACPK2GZNUKJ	0553377957	645186120	A Modern Mephistopheles	Books	3	2	9	N	N	Hardly Devilish at All	&quot;A Modern Mephistopheles&quot; is supposedly meant to be shocking and harrowing.  One reason, because it was written by Louisa May Alcott, best known for docile moral tales such as &quot;Little Women&quot;.  One other reason, is because it contains descriptions of drug use and nefarious affairs.  Yet there is little shocking about &quot;A Modern Mephistopheles&quot; except for how disappointing it truly is.<br />I was intrigued by this novel through the desciption given on the back.  It seemed to be, and is, a departure from what we've known from Alcott.  It is a tale of a failed poet Felix Canaris, who mysteriously takes up with Jasper Helwyze (nice play on a name) and is a &quot;modern&quot; mephistopheles because the poet has made a deal with the &quot;devil&quot;.  Canaris eventually marries and Helwyze even has control over his wife. In the end they want to escape his clutches, but it may be too late for them to be saved.<br />&quot;A Modern Mephistopheles&quot; is a poorly written update of &quot;Faust&quot; in disguise as a mysterious and shocking thriller.  The characters are poorly written and developed.  One never feels any connection with the four main characters; that of the two men and the ladies who inhabit their world.  Helwyze never seems devilish enough even if he &quot;ruins&quot; the life of Canaris and his wife Gladys.  It is filled with quotes from various sources (that are never given) that don't allow Alcott's story to speak for itself.  Perhaps the reason that it can't speak for itself is because it is trying to hard to be &quot;Faust&quot;; since the main characters directly refer to this masterpiece several times.  One is much better off reading the original than settling for this less-than-second-best remake.	2004-06-23

Even though I knew what was going to happen, Daphne Du Maurier still managed to keep me on my toes.  Only the greatest of suspense writers can do that.<br />&quot;Rebecca&quot; tells the tale of a young woman, without family connections, who finds herself falling in love with and agreeing to marry the widowed Maximillian DeWinter.  She becomes the &quot;second&quot; Mrs. DeWinter and must adjust to life at Manderley, the estate that Maxim owns (and, where he also lived with his first wife).  A shy and naive girl of nineteen, Mrs. DeWinter is unable to cope with the splendor and magnitude of life at Manderley.  She constantly feels that everyone is watching her and judging her; but most importantly of all, comparing her to Rebecca, the first Mrs. DeWinter.  She is also convinced that just as much as she loves her husband, he is still that much in love with his first wife.  This mindset is enhanced and complicated by the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (possibly one of the very best literary villians ever) who keeps Rebecca's rooms intact, as if she were about to walk through the door at any moment.  She terrorizes our narrator with her tales of Rebecca and how much Maxim loved her and Mrs. DeWinter believes all of Mrs. Danvers stories.<br />The past finally has to be confronted when Rebecca's body turns up in her sailboat, buried at the bottom of the sea.  The ghost that has hung over their precarious marriage finally &quot;comes to life&quot; to haunt them.  Du Maurier brings her novel to a thrilling conclusion, (even though the story technically begins after the novel's story has come to an end).  The characters are vividly written and one feels the reach of Rebecca's deviousness just as much as Mrs. DeWinter does.  And when it's all over, you want to read it again.	2004-06-23

Simon Worrall begins this tale in Amherst, Massachusettes, Dickinson's hometown, where a library raises money to buy a newly discovered poem by Emily Dickinson.  Little did they know that the poem was a forgery by a man already in prison.<br />Worrall then spins the narrative of Mark Hoffman's life.  Raised in the Mormon faith that is steeped in secrecy and mystery, Hoffman early on becomes a sceptic of the Mormon foundations.  He grows to hate the Mormon church and sets out to create a series of documents that undermine some of the key principles and teachings of the Mormon faith.  He wants to expose Joseph Smith as the con-artist Hoffman believed him to be.  And since the Mormons are so secretive, he knows that his forgeries will be bought to ensure silence that could make the church look back.<br />Worrall goes into an abundance of detail regarding the art of forgery, detailing how it was possible for Hoffman to create these new documents that looked like they were from the correct time period.  If Hoffman can fool even the most celebrated forensic experts, who wouldn't believe him?  But as the tales and lies that Mark Hoffman weaves become bigger and broader, so do his debts, and he finally resorts to murder, which lands him in jail for life.<br />Perhaps the title of this book is mere titilation, because there is little material regarding the life of Emily Dickinson herself.  Yet Worrall does point out some consistencies in character that may have drawn Hoffman to attempt to create a work of poetry that Emily herself may have written in her secretive seclusion.  &quot;The Poet and the Murderer&quot; is well-written and relatively fast-paced.  It makes one wonder if what one actually believes to be authentic can ever be proven to be so.if what one actually believes to be authentic can ever be proven to be so.	2004-06-14

Exactly what hapened in that town has been repressed and kept a secret by any of those who survived.  They will be cursed if they talk about the fateful events that happened in Kolvillag.  Yet there is one survivor, Azriel, who finds that he must tell this story, even if it goes against the oath.<br />Wiesel's story unfolds in the very beginning, as a dialogue of sorts between Azriel and a young man who is ready to take his own life.  This &quot;dialogue&quot; is somewhat confusing at first, as the reader is not sure whom is speaking which lines.  Azriel is affronted by this man's desire to take his life, an action that goes directly agains the Talmud and the Jewish faith, and he believes the story of Kolvillag may save this young man.  He therefore tells the story of his master and mentor, Moshe, the madman of Kolvillag.  In the 1920s, a Christian boy is found murdered and the Christians in the community begin to spread rumors, and then to believe these rumors, that the Jews are responsible.  (The term Christian could easily fall into quotation marks since it only implies ethnicity, not action; for the actions of these men are hardly Christian.)  In order to preserve and protect the Jews, Moshe decides to take the fall and admit to the murder of a young boy he has never met.  He hopes that his action will appease those who oppose the Jews.  How wrong he turns out to be.  The Christians, hungry for blood, might not be satisfied with the blood of one; they might demand the blood of all.<br />Wiesel is a master storyteller, weaving his faith so artfully with his fiction that &quot;The Oath&quot; reads as a factual event.  Perhaps it is because it describes the seemingly endless plight of Jews and the persecution they have endured for generations.  The holocaust of Kolvillag is the precursor for the Holocaust of World War II.  Wiesel's words are often profound and philosophical and are rooted deeply in faith and tradition.  &quot;The Oath&quot; is an incredible story of the ties that bind us to our faith and traditions, and how hard it is to break those ties; it is even more incredible for the very possibility that Kolvillag (or a town just like it) actually existed at one time.'s words are often profound and philosophical and are rooted deeply in faith and tradition.  &quot;The Oath&quot; is an incredible story of the ties that bind us to our faith and traditions, and how hard it is to break those ties; it is even more incredible for the very possibility that Kolvillag (or a town just like it) actually existed at one time.	2004-06-11

For so long, many people have argued that art can have no role in religion.  Peacock argues otherwise, saying that our words and our works are connected, and that art is essential to faith.  As a long-time singer/song-writer, Peacock ought to know.<br />The introductory chapters to the book are slightly weighed down as Peacock seems to struggle for where to begin. &quot;New Way to be Human&quot; really doesn't hit its stride until Peacock takes his theories and applies them to our everyday lives, showing how our faith affects every area of our lives.  He shows just how interconnected we remain to what Christ did for us.  What he is saying isn't necessarily revolutionary; many within various Christian circles and communities have believed this for a long time.  (One example: &quot;Walking on Water: Reflections on Faith and Art by Madeleine L'Engle, first published in 1980)  Yet it is a message that needs to be repeated, if not shouted, in order for it to resonante with the vast majority.  Perhaps Peacock's book will do the trick.	2004-06-11

And I shouldn't have been surprised to find that it was a mingling of those two - a beautifully poetic prose tinged with the instructiveness of an essay.  Wendell Berry has proven himself a master storyteller and his tales are always compelling.<br />&quot;Jayber Crow&quot; tells the life story of Jonah Crow, a barber in the Port William Membership, who affectionately becomes known as Jayber.  The novel builds slowly, dwelling on Jayber's youth and his misguided attempts to serve God through the ministry.  Disillusioned with too many doubts and questions with no answers in sight, Jayber sets off on his own and eventually discovers his talent for cutting hair.  He finds himself the barber of Port William for over thirty years, faithfully cutting hair and participating in the lives of those around him.<br />Initially, Jayber may seem like a lonely man.  He is a confirmed bachelor, who lives in his small apartment above the barber shop.  Yet he knows the deepest, fullest extent of love and passion, as yet unrequited by Mattie Keith (Chatham).  (As he says, &quot;I was married to Mattie Chatham, but she was not married to me...)  He watches Mattie as she herself experiences love, marriage, loss and misery, never once able to express his true feelings for her.  Even after he retires as barber, Jayber still remains the town's barber, and becomes an owner of property - a small cottage by the river where he can fish and reflect on the glories of nature.  By and by, Jayber comes to find the answers to those doubts and questions he had long ago concerning God and he proves himself to be a faithful servant and steward of God's creation.<br />Wendell Berry creates a wonderful cast of characters whom he evokes with believability and wisdom.  The town of Port William Membership becomes a real place on the Kentucky River, that watches as the land around it becomes more technological and industrial.  Yet Berry maintains his focus on how this industrial progress can be just as destructive as others might deem it necessary.  Berry shows this distinction in the story of the Keith family - the struggle between father and son-in-law - for the future of the family farm.<br />Berry's telling of Jayber's life is poetic and often elegiac.  As he gives up his barber shop, the reader feels like they are saying goodbye to Jayber as well.  We have lived with him through the peaks and valleys, and felt the sting of his unrequited love for Mattie.  As industrial progress closes in on Port William, we feel the decrepitude and downfall of the small &quot;backwater&quot; town.  We grieve for Jayber's losses; but Berry is not one to let the story die without a hopeful conclusion.  His final paragraphs, to me, rank among some of the best conclusions in literature.ndustrial.

Holmes is forever quizzing Watson to see things the way he does, to figure out the mysteries of small things, like a walking stick left behind by a visitor.<br />\\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" tells the story of Henry Baskerville, a man who has inherited his family's home and fortune (as the supposed final heir), but also their apparent curse.  His uncle was recently found dead on the grounds of Baskerville Hall, with little explanation for his death.  The locals are sure as to the cause; it is the mysterious hell-hound that haunts the moors that was the cause of his death.  The local doctor brings the matter to Holmes and Watson and they are charged to protect the young Henry Baskerville from a similar fate, as well as to solve the mystery of the hound.<br />While trying to gather facts for his intrepid employer, the faithful Watson narrates the strange happenings among Sir Henry's neighbors, wanting to add his own theories, but leaving the mystery solving to his much-admired mentor.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle writes a well-paced narrative that builds to a climax that is still exciting even when we know the real mystery behind the hound.  At the end, it is Holmes and not his faithful sidekick Watson, who reveals the tricks of his trade and how he solved the mystery that no one ever suspected.  Doyle has created a wonderful pair of complementary characters in Holmes and Watson and it is a joy to read their adventures.	2004-05-30

Benita Eisler allows for some cursory background knowledge of Chopin's family and upbringing, but recounts his time spent in Paris, his affair with George Sand, and his eventual demise due to consumption.  Her scant biography is a quick-paced, easy read.<br />&quot;Chopin's Funeral&quot; paints an almost &quot;rakish&quot; picture of the slight composer.  Eisler talks of his love for fashion and fashionable decorating, that is in contrast to his profession and earnings.  She tells of his relationship with the writer Sand, how the affair started and ended, and the impact it had on both.  (To Sand it seems to have been just another affair, while to Chopin it was possibly the love of his life.)<br />Eisler is much more empathetic when it comes to Chopin's sheer genius at composing, and how admired he was by his contemporaries (including Franz Liszt).  Yet it seems to be the plight of genius composers that they never achieve the success they were destined to until after their untimely death.  Chopin has left the world an incredible legacy of melancholic music that tugs at the heartstrings.  His inventions were ground-breaking at the time and worthy of much more adoration than he received.  And Eisler speaks with knowledge on many of Chopin's compositions.  While an informative read, &quot;Chopin's Funeral&quot; is much too small to give a balanced and complete look at the life of Frederick Chopin.  It leaves the reader wanting to know more and we must seek it from another source.	2004-05-30

It follows the fate of the Markham family - owners of a once prestigious PR firm that is fast losing money and sending the family into possible bankruptcy.  Nathan has reworked Austen's central characters (Anne, her loopy father and sisters, and Captain Wentworth) into believable, vulnerable and often hilarious modern persons.<br />The story beings in 1994 when the youngest of the Markham daughters, Annie, believes herself to be pregnant at the age of nineteen.  She is prepared to elope with her boyfriend Jake, when she discovers that she was only late, not pregnant.  Jake doesn't stick around long enough to hear the truth of the matter and leaves Annie heartbroken and bitter before her years.  Skip ahead seven years, when Jake re-enters Annie's life, as the only possible savior to her family's impending doom.  He is hired on as a marketing consultant who can resurrect Markham's PR, but must contend with the perceivably bitchy Annie and his own feelings about what transpired between the two of them.  And little did either Jake or Annie suspect that they would have to confront their emotions towards the other.<br />Melissa Nathan's prose is quick-paced, light-hearted and witty.  Her characters come to life as their stories intertwine to follow the plotline of Austen's &quot;Persuasion&quot;.  At times there seem to be an overabundance of characters, but their fates are so intertwined with those of the main characters and every subplot is completed by the novel's end.  &quot;Persuading Annie&quot; is a quick, enjoyable read; especially for Austen fans who wish there were more original Jane Austen material to read.  Melissa Nathan's novels are a worthy substitute.	2004-05-22

I am someone who believes that the book is always better than the movie.  And the same is true with &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley.&quot;  I truly think that Anthony Mingella's film was well-made, but there are so many nuances to Tom Ripley's character that could never receive justice on film.<br />Highsmith tells the story of the utterly forgettable Thomas Ripley, a young man who yearns for wealth and prestige to the extent that he schemes his way through life.  A golden opportunity comes along when he is tracked down by the father of Richard &quot;Dickie&quot; Greenleaf.  Dickie's father pays Tom to travel to Italy to force his wayward son to come home.  Tom sets out to fulfill this plan, but on meeting Dickie, he becomes too enthralled with his lifestyle, that he helps Dickie elude his father even more.  Tom is happy in paradise, or so it would see.  He loves Dickie's life so much (and perhaps Dickie himself) that he would do anything to have his lifestyle - including murder.<br />&quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; is a detailed character study of an unlikeable character.  Readers are meant to dislike Tom for all the reasons that other characters do, as does Tom himself.  Yet at the same time, Tom grows on the reader because we want to know what happens to him.  Even as he winds himself further and further into trouble, we want to know how he'll be able to get out of it.  Tom himself finds his situation unbelievable; rarely admitting to himself that the bad deeds he has done are real.  He keeps waiting for his luck to run out.  So do we.	2004-05-21

I was even happier to discover that &quot;Much Ado About Murder&quot; is just one of Hawke's books in a series of Smythe and Shakespeare mystery novels.  Hawke writes this novel from the time period of Shakespeare's life, where not much is known about the poet.  His novel is most definitely speculation, but it is an enjoyable read.<br />We are quickly introduced to Tuck Smythe, a player in the King's Men, who rooms with Shakespeare, a down-on-his-luck player, who writes some sonnets on the side to earn some money to keep himself fed.  Due to their connections, these two players come into contact with various sorts - the seemingly-wealthy would-be patrons, and the band of roving apprentices who fashion themselves to be thieves.  Trouble ensues for Tuck Smythe as he befriends Ben Dickens, a returning soldier who used to be a member of the King's Men.  And sure enough, Shakespeare and Tuck find themselves at the heart of a murder mystery, desperately trying to clear the name of an innocent acquaintance.<br />Hawke's narrative is relatively quick-paced and filled with sly quips that any reader of Shakespeare will recognize.  These will, of course, later become lines in the plays that Shakespeare struggles to write.  In fact, Shakespeare seems to get some of his best lines from others, asking them if he could write down what they said and credit it as his own.  Anyone familiar with &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; will recognize the parallels to this novel's plot, with some inventive differences.  At times, however; the narrative seems too bogged down with characters before it hits its stride about half-way through the book.  Yet I look forward to reading the others in this series.	2004-05-17

As a life-long stickler in regard to spelling and punctuation, I was eager to read this book as soon as I heard about it.  Lynne Truss's hilarious prose, and at-times diatribe against the ignorant who abuse our system of punctuation, is well-written and peppered with humorous sketches that detail the plight of our periods, commas, semi-colons and apostrophes.<br />Thrown in with her stories of punctuation-gone-wrong, are the straightforward rules for using the various symbols that enhance our reading and writing.  Now, admittedly, some of these rules aren't straightforward and can confound even the most dedicated grammarian.  Yet Truss lays out the rules with simple and laugh-out-loud examples.  I found myself laughing along with her stories, because they were so familiar to me as well.<br />Punctuation, as well as spelling, is in a sad state of affairs in our present times.  I cannot read anything without a critical eye and always find numerous mistakes that should have been caught.  Yet if our youth aren't taught how to correctly use punctuation in the first place, how could they know how to fix it when it's wrong?  Truss sees some hope, some light at the end of the tunnel, and it lies with those of us who are sticklers for correct usage.  If we arm ourselves to combat ill-usage, perhaps we can change the tide.<br />This book is not for everyone.  If you don't know when you should use a semi-colon or a colon, than you most likely won't find this book funny.  Informative, but not funny.  And if you don't go into a blind fury when you see a &quot;Truck's Only&quot; sign in a parking lot, than this is not the book for you.  Or perphas it is, because you might learn something.

(I was perhaps a little struck by the comparison to Monty Python.)  I promptly bought \\"A House Called Awful End\\" for my niece, and spent the night ploughing through the book, laughing the entire way.  What a brilliant and witty narrative Philip Ardagh spins.  Needless to say, I was eagerly awaiting a chance to read more about the mishaps and misadventures of the young Eddie Dickens.<br />\\"Dreadful Acts\\" introduces us once again to the hilariously weird world that Eddie inhabits.  He lives in a house called Awful End with his Mad Uncle Jack (who lives in a treehouse, well, a dried-fish house), his even Madder Aunt Maud (who lives in a hollow cow named Marjorie - don't ask if you haven't read the first book), his parents and various other servants who have little sense among the lot of them.  Eddie is awoken one morning to find a driverless hearse in the driveway and must contend with the coffin that is left behind and the escapologist inside that coffin, The Great Zucchinni.  Eddie's escapades with Zucchinni and his helper Daniella, land Eddie in a variety of troubling positions - jail, helping escaped convicts, and a chase on the misty moors that surround the town.<br />Set in Victorian England, Ardagh peppers his narration with whimsical asides to the readers, definitions of possible little-known words and comments about how our hero might feel if he were in a book.  Ardagh's pithy narration is sprinkled with sketches (by David Roberts) that enhance the crazy characters that fill Eddie's life.  While the series does read a little like Lemony Snicket, Ardagh has his own style and humor that bring Eddie and his insane relatives to life.  And while this may be classified as a children's book, it's intelligence and humor are suited for any adult who appreciates good literature.	2004-05-10

Yet through all of these adventures, and some mishaps, they remain the truest of friends.  They have formed a bond that even their conflicting desires  and greedy natures cannot break.<br />After returning from WWI, Danny (the main character and leader of the gang) finds himself an heir to two houses from his grandfather.  His friends quickly take up residence in first one house and then in Danny's house.  They look out for each other, these six grown men, who vacilate from wisdom to foolishness, and bcome better men for having such friends.<br />As usual, Steinbeck's prose is at times sparse, at other times poetic.  His characters are vividly drawn, and their sometimes larger-than-life antics are alive.  &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot; may be hard to get into at the beginning of the novel, but once you've entered their world, you won't want to leave it.	2004-05-06

An entrepenuer wants to locate all of England's tourist attractions onto the Isle of Wight in an attempt to create an idealized England.  Why should tourists have to travel all around the nation when they can visit every attraction and quintessential moment of history in one location?  (Even if those attractions aren't necessarily the originals.)<br />Barnes' narrative begins with the memories of its main character Martha as she tries to figure out the truth and the lies of one's memory.  This introductory chapter is a well-written examination into how we construct the memories of our youth.  The novel then tries to examine how we construct the memories of our history and national identity.  Martha works for Sir Jack Pitman and helps him develop his idea of the perfect England.  They renovate the Isle of Wight to include attractions such as Big Ben, the Tower of London and a scaled down Buckingham Palace, complete with King and Queen.  There are, of course, cream teas and various pubs, along with a crew of actors who re-enact the Battle of Britain, Robin Hood and his Merrie Men and other famous acts of history that are essential to one's notion of what makes England, England.<br />Yet things are not perfect on this idealized island that becomes known as England, England.  While tourism booms on the island, Old England falls apart with its main industry gone.  Barnes examines what happens to memory when it is molded to fit expectations instead of historical accurracy.  While at times uneven, and with a few storylines that seem unnecessary, &quot;England, England&quot; succeeds in its examination of the role memory plays in each of our lives, and in the shaping of our past and present.	2004-04-30

While not necessarily factual, this play by Peter Shaffer is an intelligent and fascinating examination of two men's suffering: pain in both mediocrity and genius.<br />The play is fast-paced and a relatively easy read.  Shaffer paints an elaborate picture of both composer's lives during the time in which they lived.  Shaffer's portrait of Salieri is richly written, his thoughts are revealed to the reader/audience through direct speeches and sidebars.  Characters act as moving set pieces - their dialogue starting or ending as they carry furniture on and off stage to change scenes.<br />Shaffer's play is an examination into the ruin of both men.  Mozart is ruined by his lifestyle and his lack of funding; the citizens and rulers of Vienna find him rude and offensive.  They fail to understand the unfamiliar directions his genius is taking the musical world. Salieri is ruined by his fall into mediocrity and obscurity when Mozart arrives in town, the musician blessed by God, and through his plots that lead to Mozart's downfall.  While much about the play is  based on speculation, it never rings false because of the strong portrayls of each man.<br />Having just recently seen this version of the play performed, it is obvious why Shaffer struggled with getting the character of Salieri &quot;just right.&quot;  He finds absolution in his final act - confessing his sins to his created audience, and not to the creator he once yearned to serve.	2004-04-27

This is the first time I have read something by John Irving, and while I will admit that I found him to be an engaging story-teller, I was a little disappointed in the story itself.  &quot;A Widow for One Year&quot; tells the tale of Ruth Cole at three different stages of her life.  We first meet her as a four year old in 1958, and then again in 1990 and 1995.<br />The upcoming movie is obviously solely based on the first segment of this novel and I think that it is the strongest section of Irving's narrative.  It tells of the unhappy marriage between Ruth's parents, the affair that her mother has with a 16 year old boy (not to mention the father's numerous affairs), and how in the end Ruth's mother has to escape the life she's afraid to have.  This event will haunt Ruth for the rest of her life (as demonstrated in parts 2 and 3, in her string of bad relationships and fear of marriage).  These next two parts of the narrative focus on Ruth's aging and her career, how she eventually marries and has a child, all the while searching for what would make her happy, even as she is still haunted with why her mother left her.  She finds some solace through friendship with her mother's former lover, the grown-up Eddie O'Hare, a writer of autobiographical fiction who is still in love with Ruth's mother Marion.<br />The second and third setions of narrative seem to become bogged down with an overabundance of supporting characters.  While these characters are richly drawn and believable, it detracts from the story at hand.  Sometimes while I was reading, I wasn't entirely sure where the story would end end (especially during Ruth's forays into the red-light district of Amsterdam).  When the conclusion finally arrives after almost 600 pages, it seems both drawn-out and too summarily wrapped up.<br />I found Irving to be an intrepid storyteller, and his characters are vivid and realistic.  However, it seems strange that almost every main character in this novel is a writer.  And after a while, one might begin to wonder if there's some sort of autobiographical writing taking place for Irving himself.  The first part of this narrative is the strongest and I'd be tempted to say that it could stand alone; except we want to know what happens with Ruth, with Eddie, with her mother.  Sometimes what we get seems more than enough; sometimes it seems to be barely enough.ntrepid storyteller, and his characters are vivid and realistic.

However, Simon Winchester's book is an extremely well-written and researched portrayal of little-known history.  &quot;The Professor and the Madman&quot; is an engaging read that draws its readers into the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and therefore into a time when dictionaries were scarce - a fact that is unfathomable today.<br />Winchester begins his tale by setting up the &quot;madman&quot; character, Dr. W.C. Minor, an American in London, who winds up in an asylum for committing murder.  He then transfers to set up the character of Professor James Murray, the man who would be chief editor of the dictionary's progress for several decades.  The narrative alternates between these two men's lives, until they finally meet through the work of compiling the millions of words that make up the English language.  Dr. Minor, although insane, contributed largely to the formation of the dictionary - a labor of love, as it turns out, for both men.  Their stories are interspersed with the history of certain words and the attempts at previous dictionaries, all of which set out to record the majesty of the English language.<br />Winchester's portrayal of these two men and the dictionary that consumed much of their life is fascinating.  As I mentioned earlier, it seems strange to think that a book about a dictionary wouldn't be dry; yet Winchester tells this extraordinary tale with intelligence, wit, and tenderness which captures the tragedy of Dr. Minor's confined life.  As well as recounting Minor's impeccable and invaluable work for the dictionary, he recounts the struggles that haunted Minor throughout his imprisonment, and indeed his life.  Winchester's book is a true testament to the power of words, as well as the ever-mysterious workings of the human mind.	2004-04-17

The description and questions on the back caught my eye (How did three sisters in a remote parsonage know so much about the darker passions of love?), and made me curious enough to purchase it then and there.  I must admit I was immediately drawn in by the introduction and the lawyer's description of his find.  As a fan of the Bronte sisters, who wouldn't be thrilled with such a discovery?  If only the rest of the book lived up to its beginning, or even, the questions that raised my curiosity in the first place.<br />On the back of the book, it is explained to us that the author, James Tully, although a &quot;noted criminologist&quot;, chose to write this story as a novel.  The introduction is written by a lawyer in the firm that had this story sealed, and we are asked to compare this narration to the popular version of the Bronte tale, and see which one seems to be the more likely of the two.  The story then unfolds as young Martha, a maid in the Bronte parsonage, tells tale of all the happenings at Haworth over almost two decades.  Her retelling is concluded at each chapter by the lawyer's conjecture of truths (or shall I say &quot;truths&quot;) that add veracity to Martha's story.  Martha's story lets us know about the evil doings of Arthur Bell Nicholls, Charlotte's husband, who had his hand in the mysterious deaths that occured at Haworth parsonage, including Charlotte's herself.<br />Tully has an interesting theory.  It does seem strange and mysterious how three members of the Bronte clan died in such a short span of time and with similar symptoms.  He raises some questions that might make you question what you know to be true about the Brontes.  Yet this novel is far from enligtening or even satisfactory.  I was disappointed when I finished reading.  However, I am left with only one question after finishing this novel.  If there is any truth to these accusations, why would a criminologist write this as fiction, and not as fact?  Written as fiction, it reads as such.write this as fiction, and not as fact?

Yet the life of this brilliant poet, which was cut short just before the armistice that ended World War I, remains unknown to far too many.  Wilfred Owen is referred to as a \\"soldier-poet\\" of WWI, which includes him in the company of such literary standards as Rupert  Brooke, Robert Graves and Siegfried Sassoon.  But, as perhaps the greatest poet among the three, he is the least known.  Dominic Hibberd's new biography will hopefully set that to rights.<br />I first fell in love with Wilfred Owen's poetry when I read \\"Dulce et Decorum est.\\"  I found his imagery real and terrifying as it spoke to the true brutality and horrors of \\"modern\\" warfare.  (The poem is a description of a soldier dying in a gas attack.)  Throughout the years I have read much on WWI and on the soldier-poets, but nothing has come as close to so vividly portraying the life of one of them as Hibberd's new biography.<br />Hibberd begins his very thorough telling of Owen's life, starting with his familial background and youth, and working his way through Owen's years as a parish assistant and his numerous attempts to gain a university education.  It seems a long time before we are to encounter Wilfred as a soldier, but Hibberd builds a solid base that explains Wilfred's personality and his attitude towards poetry.  Owen's devoutly Evangelical mother had wished her son to enter the service of the church, but after his time in Dunsden, Owen found it increasingly hard to reconcile his Christian faith with his love of literature, finding the two to oppose each other.  His one desire in life was to be a poet, and upon entering the English army, he probably had no idea that his voice would come through war.  Only a few of Owen's poems (five)  were published in his lifetime and after his untimely death, his poetry was collected and published in the 20s and 30s.  Afterwards, he seems to disappear entirely from the literary map until a renewed interest in his work arose in the 1960s; an appropriate time since another \\"war to end all wars\\" was being fought in Vietnam.<br />The one area of dicord I take with this biography concerns Owen's sexuality.  In the book jacket, and several times throughout the book, Hibberd states that Owen was a homosexual.  This is evidently shown through his connections with various personages who were homosexuals, including his friend and mentor, fellow soldier and poet, Siegfried Sassoon.  While I don't doubt that this was the truth regarding Owen's sexuality, Hibberd seems a little over-insistent with too little to back it up.  Yet perhaps this is due to the inconsistencies that exist in the mystery surrounding Wilfred Owen.  Hibberd makes it known that much was done by Owen's brother Harold to paint his brother (as well as himself and the family name) in a better light.  As curator of his brother's letters, Harold took great pains to destroy any references that could be suspicious, which must include references to Owen's sexual preferences.  As seemingly complete as this biography is, Hibberd himself points out in his epilogue that there are facts about Owen's life that we may never know.<br />This book is an engaging read for any fan of World War I or any fan of poetry.  The literary world is much indebted to Owen, whose poetry spoke the truth in a time or darkness, and whose innovations with style and technique were revered by the very poets he once emulated.  If only the literary world was aware of this.  Perhaps Dominic Hibberd's book will finally grant Owen his distinguished place and well-deserved fame in modern literature.iterary map until a renewed interest in his work arose in the 1960s; an appropriate time since another \\"war to end all wars\\" was being fought in Vietnam.<br />The one area of dicord I take with this biography concerns Owen's sexuality.

The story focuses on the narrator, Paul Baumer, as he and his friends come face to face with the horrors of war that the older generation will never experience.  Abruptly, thier idealistic notions are shattered as they encounter the newest monstrosities of war - tanks, airplanes, machine guns, gas, etc... that destroy not only lives, but the spirits of those who are &quot;lucky&quot; enough to survive.<br />At times poetic, Erich Maria Remarque's novel doesn't depict war as glorious or noble.  His soldiers question their reason for fighting and long for a home that will never be the same after the war.  When the main character receives a leave for home, he finds it more damaging than restoring.  In the front lines, he can live with what he sees because he doesn't think about it.  At home, everyone has the wrong idea of war - how noble their actions are, how easy winning should be - and dwelling on these thoughts, the soldier cannot bear the sights he sees when he returns to war.  He cannot handle the killing.  Remarque has his narrator speak of the disparity between fighting and life - how after the war, nothing will be the same for this generation of young soldiers, barely out of their teens; their life now is made up of death.<br />As an avid fan of anything relating to WWI and WWII, this book speaks volumes to just how horrific and unexpectedly devastating WWI was to an entire generation.  Knowing the experiences of other soldiers (such as the soldier-poets Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen) allows Remarque's narrative to resonanate all the more deeply.  His novel could very well be the beginning signal of what we've come to call &quot;the lost generation.&quot;  For indeed, these soldiers are lost.	2004-04-01

It was recommended to me by one of my friends who I spent 4 months with in Oxford, England.  I don't know what took me so long to finally get to it, but I am glad that I did.<br />As an American living in England, Bryson is familiar with their culture, their way of life, their idiosyncrasies.  His descriptions of English manners and formalities are dead-on.  He speaks often of the dry wit and humor that he admires so much in the English people; Bryson himself is a master of this, making me laugh out loud with his summaries and interactions.<br />This truly is an &quot;affectionate&quot; portrait of Britain, as the book is subtitled.  Part travel-narrative, part memoir, &quot;Notes From a Small Island&quot; gives the good along with the bad.  As Bryson ruminates between his recent travels along Britian to memories of past trips/his experiences living there, he offers what he loves and loathes about the nation he has come to call home and will miss when he returns to his native land.  He speaks with admiration and enthusiasm on the vast number of treasures and historical sites the English have in such a small area, yet many of these have been neglected when they should be revered.<br />Bryson's final tour around Britian before heading back to America, takes him to some typical tourist destination cities, but he offers an insider's view of places the average tourist may never encounter.  As someone who has lived in England, it is usually the places off the beaten track that are the best places to visit.  I miss it almost as much as Bryson.	2004-03-29

Having never read anything about his life, I found this book insightful but also a little redundant.  This isn't necessarily a book to read straight through,  but might work better read over time in order to dispel the similarities in questions/answers.<br />This is not a biography, but rather a collection of interviews the confirmed &quot;recluse&quot; gave over the span of his life.  Gorey talks passionately about his loves (ballet, cats, reading) as well as his hates (Henry James - and who could argue?).  Each interview paints a picture of the artist that lives up to the weird and wondrous works he creates.  Gorey's works are bizarre and although not intentionally macabre, they are oddly disconcerting, if not downright unsetlling.  Sometimes his knowledge and responses have the same effect.<br />For anyone who is a fan of this too little known author and artist, &quot;Ascending Peculiarity&quot; is a wonderful portrait of Edward Gorey.  It leaves you wanting to know more, wishing you were there asking the questions, just as many of his works leave you wondering what they were all about.	2004-03-22

For those whose wish is the same as mine, Stephanie Barron's mystery novels have been a pleasure to read.<br />While not entirely perfect, and at times perhaps a little forced in language and style, Barron has affected a heroine of Jane, the likes of which Austen herself would create.  One might not deem Jane a likely detective, but anyone who has read her novels is familiar with the secrets and mysteries that are uncovered within.  This is proven evidence that Austen herself would've made a likely detective.<br />Her second foray into sleuthing seems more quick-paced than the first (\\"The Unpleasantness at Scargrave Manor\\").  While vacationing in Lyme, Jane is thrown into the acquaintance of a Mr. Sidmouth, whose dark demeanor and sardonic wit grab at Jane's heart as readily as her mind's vexation.  The town is in an uproar over smuggling and the mysterious night-time leader of illegal activity, known only as the Reverend.  Jane, in her curiosity, finds herself embroiled in the mystery of discovering who the Reverend is, in order to save the life of Mr. Sidmouth, or (perhaps to her dismay) prove he is the Reverend.  Barron paints the cast of supporting characters well, and creates just enough plot twists to keep you wondering who the Reverend actually is.<br />Barron has captured the time and language of Austen's day.  She insists, in her introductions, that these are Jane's actual memoirs and she has just merely edited them.  While at times, the style seems a little too forced in order to evoke Austen's writing, this is easily overlooked through the sheer pleasure of reading what Jane herself might have written.  I look forward to reading more of the series.	2004-03-17

The &quot;problem&quot; (and I place this in quotes since I don't really see it as a problem) with O'Brien's work, is that one isn't sure whether he is writing fact or fiction.  His memories of Vietnam that make up &quot;The Things They Carried&quot; make one question whether they are fact of fiction.  (And I mention this here since the ghosts of Vietnam have their hold over the main character of this novel as well.)  The same holds true for &quot;In the Lake of the Woods.&quot;  O'Brien uses character interviews and references, footnooted in the Evidence chapters to build his narrative to its climax.<br />&quot;In the Lake of the Woods&quot; tells the story of a disintegrating marriage, that neither partner is ready to admit to.  John and Kathy Wade have escaped to a cabin in the woods for two weeks until the world around them has calmed down.  John is a politician who was slaughtered in the last election when the dark secrets of his past are revealed.  And as a politician, he cannot have any &quot;skeletons&quot; in the closet (how apt that I read this in an election year).  The two hardly communicate, their bond is fragile and their future uncertain.  To complicate matters, John wakes up one morning to find Kathy missing.  The locals suspect foul play; John claims he is innocent, but he is not above reproach.  The novel then sets about trying to uncover the mystery not only of Kathy's disappearance, but of John's secret past.<br />O'Brien has again proven himself a master story-teller.  One is immediately enthralled by the main characters and their mysteries.  While reading, one is torn between like and dislike for John Wade, known to his war buddies as the magician, and one wonders just what tricks he has up his sleeves.  The tricks that O'Brien has are his vivid characters and beautiful prose.  His chapters fluctuate between differing points of view to offering evidence to what happened, as well as to what might have happened.  O'Brien ends his novel by giving the reader the ending, allowing them to choose the scenario they like best.  This is the only way a novel of such depth and intrigue could have ended; leaving a mystery unsolved, as though the &quot;facts&quot; of the story were real.

The only thing I knew about the Schindlers was from seeing the Speilberg movie, so I thought reading about their experience firsthand would be insightful and rewarding.  In her introduction, Emilie states that her husband was not a hero and neither was she.  This isn't a statement trying to discredit their actions, but rather an attitude that is commonplace among WWII survivors.  Any soldier who receives a medal will tell you that he isn't a hero.  The heroes are always described as those who gave their lives.<br /><br />Emilie Schindler begins her very brief memoir with scattered stories, remembrances and incidences from her childhood that are meant to show us at once how inquisitive and stubborn she was, qualities that later served her during WWII.  Her memories seem scattered here and there, with no focus, until she meets Oskar Schindler and marries him shortly thereafter.  As she talks about their experience working as spies, she also highlights and rehashes Oskar's numerous affairs, some with acquaintances and the approval of mutual acquaintances.  From the movie, we know that Oskar was not a faithful husband, but the trouble with Emilie's tirade is that she claims not to be angry at her husband.  If she isn't angry, why is nearly a quarter of the memories about her husband's infidelities?  And if she was so hurt by his actions, why did she stay with him?  She talks about his mysterious and seductive nature that made women pursue him instead of vice versa, but there's no concrete reason to support both her anger at him and her staying with him.  Even the words she claims to have uttered at his graveside for filming the Speilberg movie, seem hollow and untrue when viewed with what she has written previously.  If she has forgiven him for his infidelities and leaving her, it certainly doesn't show in her scrambled prose.  And the final lesson of the prologue that we are to \\"love one another\\" is almost laughable after her tirade against her husband.<br /><br />I'm not trying to say that Emilie Schindler didn't love her husband, or that she doesn't deserve credit for her role in the so-called \\"Schindler's List\\", because the truth of the matter is that her and her husband saved over a thousand Jews.  And without her help, Oskar Schindler most likely would not have succeeded.  However, as inspiring as their story is, and could have been portrayed, this memoir is a bitter rant in disguise.ogue that we are to \\"love one another\\" is almost laughable after her tirade against her husband.

Immediately I was struck by the bold, yet somewhat disturbing illustrations (the voodoo doll) that accompanied Saunders slight moral tale.<br />&quot;The Very Persistent Gapper of Frip&quot; tells the tale of the extremely small town of Frip, three families to be exact, who make their living raising goats and protecting their beloved economy from the gappers - bright orange shrieking creatures who love goats.  If left to their own devices, the gappers will completely cover a goat and soon he will stop giving milk, therefore putting a halt to any sort of income for the three families.  The children of the three families are responsible for brushing the numerous gappers from their goats at any given time of the day.  The less-than-bright gappers settle their sights on the main character, Capable's goats.  She has lost her mother and her father refuses to change (or to eat anything that isn't white) and so she is left alone to handle all the gappers of Frip since her neighbors believe her to be cursed.  Seemingly alone, Capable must teach herself, her father, and her neighbors the true meaning of community (as well as how to overcome the persistent gappers).<br />&quot;The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip,&quot; is a delightful and quick read even if it has a somewhat apparent purpose and moral.  The illustrations by Lane Smith truly elevate this slight tale to an instant classic.	2004-03-10

I found this book to be a relatively easy read.  Jack Sacco writes the stories of the the 92nd Signal Battalion as the memoir that his father, Joe Sacco, never wrote.  Culled most likely from years of hearing his father's war stories, and seeing the sometimes horrific pictures his father kept in his scrapbook, Jack Sacco has paid a wonderful tribute not only to his father, but also to the men his father lived, worked, and fought with.  The characters are vividly painted, and seem to come to life, if not seem a little familiar to anyone who has seen or read anything relating to WWII and combat.<br />I was slightly disappointed that there isn't more about Dachau in the book.  (Only one chapter is devoted to the men arriving at the concentration camp and the horrors they uncover there.)  For such a critical issue, it seems that Sacco could have spent more time on the soldiers' discoveries and the reaction of the townspeople of Dachau.  &quot;They had to have known&quot; about the horrors of the concentration camp located near their homes and I, for one, would have liked for there to have been more on this topic.  Nevertheless, this is an engaging account of a soldier's experiences during WWII.	2004-02-23

Immediately I was drawn into the rich and sumptuous southern community that Tartt paints, as well as into the lives of the characters with all their idiosyncracies.<br />After getting hooked, and wanting to know what happens to Harriet (the main character) and also wanting her to solve the mystery of her brother Robin's murder, I was sorely disappointed when the book seemed to crash off course in the middle.  I wasn't sure where the book was going; and I wasn't entirely sure that Tartt herself knew where the book was going.  Harriet believes she knows who Robin's killer is, but has no evidence.  The story veers off to tell that of the Ratliff family, with their poor-white-trash background, and criminal and drug addictions.  This plot doesn't fit with the world Tartt had created for Harriet and distracts from the narrative.  I can understand the comparison/contrast being made between the two lifestyles, but their story seems to be a novel in itself, and does nothing to enhance Harriet's character.  In fact, through her interactions with the Ratliff's, Harriet becomes annoying and the reader wants to see her fail.<br />It's not surprising that critics loved Tartt's sophomore book and that readers didn't.  As much as I looked forward to this book, it shouldn't have surprised me to be disappointed in it, since I barely managed to get through the first chapter of &quot;A Secret History,&quot; Tartt's debut bestseller.  I'm just glad I bought the book at discount and didn't pay full price.	2004-02-20
