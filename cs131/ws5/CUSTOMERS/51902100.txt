I found this book to be flat, dull and boring and the authour to be rather self-congratulatory.  The author travels from one small Sicilian town to another trying to ... do what?  I dunno.  I read every word, and she didn't have much to say about Sicily or her people except that she likes them.  She really likes them!   <br /> <br />As the series of vignettes progressed, it became difficult to follow any kind of time line. What happened when and with whom?  Dunno.  I am still unclear on how this book of little stories was organized, if indeed it was.   <br /> <br />Finally, I don't know that I gleaned anything from the book except that the author really likes Sicily and she's really glad that she got to live there and she's really lucky that anyone would publish her book.	2005-04-15

The soul of the book is the intense relationship between Henry and Clare that seems not only pre-destined but also transcendent.  The element of time-travel is what makes the story fascinating.<br /><br />Clare meets Henry for the first time when she is a small child and he is a grown man.  As she grows up, he continues to meet with her, and when she finally meets him in \\"real time,\\" he doesn't know her because he hasn't met her yet, but she knows that he is her future.<br /><br />The author does an amazing job of interwearving the time-travel and real-time sequences of the novel.  Henry is the fabric of Clare's whole life, and she becomes his port in his freqently scary existence.<br /><br />The novel brings up questions of free-will and pre-destination.  Does Clare ever really have a choice when it comes to her love for Henry?  Their relationship is both real and over-the-top romantic.  These were characters I fell in love with.  I couldn't bring myself to stop reading, and I felt bereft when I finished.<br /><br />This was a wonderful story and a great read that I will think about for a long time.	2005-01-24

I generally love his work, but this...this was so verbose, so overbearing, so self-involved that it was pretty much unreadable.  So bad.  His characters are caricatures, and he belabors every single point that the book is trying to make. Pages and pages to make me understand that our heroine is poor and her roommate is rich.  Pages to let me know there is racial tension on college teams.  (Wow!)  Just awful.    <br /> <br />And, as other readers have noted, Wolfe seems to be too far out of touch with the universities of today to be able to write anything meaningful about them.  Classes are dumbed-down for jocks. (Incredible!)  College is a breeding ground for binge drinkers. (Shocking!) Kids have sex in their room.  (Scandalous!) None of this is news, nor is it particularly interesting.  Certainly not interesting enough to merit 600+ pages. <br /> <br />Don't waste your time with this terrible read.	2005-01-20
US	51902100	R3JLDB5TS9GCNQ	0804113475	376970861	Ladder of Years	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Not satisfying	Tyler writes melancholy angst and befuddlement better than anyone, and this novel is another example -- i.e. more of the same.  Her novels become so similar that it seems as though the various characters could be supplanted in any of her novels, and no reader would be any the wiser.<br />In any event, this novel finds Delia vaguely dissatisfied with her life, and she leaves her family to pursue a new life on her own.  While the premise of the novel is exciting, the actual read is flat and lacks realism.  It seemed implausible that she could leave her children for eighteen months without a word.  When she finally finds herself coming full circle and returning home, it was absurd to me that she could simply step back into her old life.  Finally, the ending left so many questions unanswered and so many loose ends that it was simply annoying.  On the other hand, I was glad the book had ended...<br />So, this isn't Tyler's best work, but it is truly hers.  If you enjoy her novels, you will enjoy this one despite its boat load of shortcomings.	2004-02-11

While there were sections that I felt as though I were wading through, I could not WAIT to get to the end of the book to unlock the secret of Lily's mother and Tiberon.  On a completely superficial level, this is a great book.  But don't think too hard.  If you suspend your voluntary suspension of disbelief even for a moment, this story of a white girl shacking up with a family of black women in Klan country in 1964 completely falls apart.

(\\"The new baby is so little...too little to walk, too little to talk, to little to eat candy or apples or ice cream...\\") I have given this book to little girls with new siblings, and it has become a daily must-read.  The book puts the emphasis on the newness of big-sisterhood rather than on the new baby, and that is a treat when there is a newborn in the house.  The girls can really identify with the big sister in the book, and they love seeing that other babies do just what their little sibling does!  Of course, the book includes the message that Mom & Dad have enough love for the big sister and the baby, and that a new baby is another part of a loving family.	2003-10-11

I found myself caring for the characters and rooting for one over the other. The book does draw you in. However, the plot leads us on and on into what is finally a dismal abyss. My problem is not that the final twists of the plot are implausible (which they most certainly are.) My problem is that the entire ending of the book is simply miserable. And really, I should have known. The hallmark of Oprah's books is that they are bleak yet hopeful -- until the end, that is, when her book choices are still bleak but all hope has been unrefuteably obliterated. So, this was a good book. But take heed: there is no happy ending here. Nothing to feel good about. No hope at all. None. So finally, I was left unsatisfied even though it was a good read.	2002-07-26

I read this book for the first time what seems like 100 years ago, and its story has never left me. This is the chronicle of Claudia, who is certain that she is gravely mistreated at home.  She convinces her younger brother to run away with her, and her point of destination is the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Running away and living in that fabulous museum would be story enough, if you ask me.  However, during their stay at the museum they stumble upon a secret involving a beautiful sculpted angel with curious markings on its base. The story weaves a engrossing mystery that is solved by the two children with the help of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler.  However, the solution to the mystery is not the point of the story. These children learn that some secrets can be beautiful and can change who you are forever.  I loved this book when I was nine, and I love this book today -- some twenty plus years later. Read this book yourself, read it to your child, read it with your child. It will become part of who you are.	2002-07-26

While the main character is obese, that is not the main point of the story.  I think that this book, more than any other, tells the real tale of what it is like to be a twenty-something woman in the U.S. today.  The story weaves Cannie's whole life -- her job, her love life, her requisite screwed up family, as well as her hopes and dreams.  Her weight does play a part in the story, but this is not a Cinderella ending.  It is not about becoming beautiful, but rather is about being beautiful all along.

His illustrations are always fantastic, but his stories can be erratic.  This on is a dead-on hit.  It is the brief story of a caterpillar's feeding frenzy before he makes his metamorphosis into a butterfly.  The book introduces children to the days of the week, the names of fruits, and numbers as the caterpillar eats through different foods each day --two pears on Tuesday, three plums on Wednesday, etc.-- until he finally weaves his cocoon and emerges as a beautiful butterfly.  This story is a hit every time.  Carle's bright colors and clever die-cut artwork never cease to entertain even the youngest child, and there is surely nothing in nature closer to magic than the emergence of a butterfly.  This is a beautiful and fun book that will enthrall any child.	2002-07-02

(I am in my early 30's, FYI.) I thought that my brother needed some kind of tangible representation not only of death but also of what to expect at the funeral. <br />The important part of this book is that it introduces children to the idea of death and to the ritual of a funeral and to one conception of what happens after we die. In the case of my brother, it opened the doors of communication so that he could ask everything he wanted to know about death. And when my father did die, my brother was prepared. He wasn't surprised by anything that happened because he had a comfortable understanding of what was going on around him. <br />I give Shriver great credit for creating this valuable book. It is not a replacement for communication within the family, but it is a good jumping-off point for discussions.	2002-07-02

I purchased it during my first trimester and could not believe how worthless it was.  Essentially, the book's mantra is &quot;follow the food pyramid.&quot;  What to eat in the second trimester?  &quot;Follow the food pyramid!&quot;  What to eat post-partum?  &quot;Follow the food pyramid!&quot;  They could have simply printed a one-sentence flashcard rather than a book.  The book lacked detail and cohesion.  It was poorly written and simply annoying.  Any single issue of any pregnancy magazine can give you every bit of information offered in this useless book.	2002-06-27

The pictures are really fabulous, and I have spent hours looking through it and reading the text over and over again.  My only disappointment is that there is not enough old Hollywood in the book.  But, for new Hollywood photos and gossip, this is a primo tome.	2002-06-22

But really, there's nothing new here. Who doesn't know that those who fancy themselves the academic elite are, well, elitists? I found the satire to be more the level of a lampoon, and the academic charicatures weren't really worth my time. The story and plot were good ones; however, the author's heavy-handed attempts at satire resulted in verbage that had to be waded through rather than enjoyed.	2001-11-11

The only mystery about this book was how it got published in the first place.  Unlike other reviewers, I found the characters to be completely one-dimensional and pedantic.  The plot was more predictable than a rerun of \\"Murder She Wrote.\\" And please, the talking animals were as absurd as they were annoying.  There were such strong echo's of Disney's The Fox and the Hound, I thought I might be stranded in Orlando.  Really, this book had no redeeming qualities.  If your reading level is over that of a 10 to 12 year old, don't waste your time.	2001-11-05

An Oprah book that doesn't take the reader to the deep dark depths of doom, despair, and depression!<br />This is the story of a woman's self-discovery after her husband of twelve years leaves her.  Her evolution as a woman makes this ride worthwhile.	2001-11-05

His wit is dry and sardonic, and really, what better target for irreverent wit than the holiday season.  His short stories are all rooted in his life history, his recounting of truly hillarious incidences.  I loved this book, and recommend it to anyone who appreciates dry humor.  If you want to be amused, read his work.	2001-11-05

The story was, for the most part, interesting and well-written, but there were chapters and chapters that I felt like I was just wading through to finally finish the book. I think that the story line really picked up in the last half of the book.  Unfortunately, I had to slog through the first half to get there.  The book isn't terrible.  It's just not great.  So read some other work of Allende's -- The House of the Spirits, Of Love and Shadows, The Stories of Eva Luna -- and you will have a more satisfying experience.	2001-01-16

Frankweiler	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	A Great Book	I read this book what seems like 100 years ago, and its story has never left me.  This is the chronicle of two children who run away from home and live in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  During their stay they stumble upon a secret and learn that some secrets can be beautiful.  Some secrets can change who you are forever.  I loved this book when I was nine, and I love this book today -- some twenty plus years later.  Read this book yourself, read it to your child, read it with your child.  It will become part of who you are.	2001-01-15

I am a huge Atwood fan, and I found myself struggling through this novel.  I could not bear to read the sci-fi Zycron passages.  The primary story was a good one, and the ending was fascinating, but this ride was not worthwhile.  Read any of her other works before this one -- Alias Grace, Handmaid's Tale, Cat's Eye, Robber Bride.....	2001-01-15

Madeline writes this book as a tribute to her mother and to her mother's life during the summer that her mother lays dying in Madeline's Crosswicks home.  The book has very strong echoes (read repetitive)of A Circle of Quiet and therefore should not be read immediately after reading that one.  While I found her story interesting and sometimes fascinating, I did get bogged down in some of her listings of her family tree.  But this was overall another lovely book that was thouroughly Madeline	2001-01-15

I don't even understand the musings of other reviewers who found her characters flat or the plot slow.  This was a great book.  It was totally different from Poisonwood (which I also loved), but it was still a great read.  I was immediately drawn into the novel and found it difficult to put down.  The book, like all of her books, has a heavy-duty message.  This time, she is examining the questions of environmentalism, specifically hunting and pesticide use.  As always, her beliefs are clear even as she leads us through both sides of the issue by introducing us to opposing characters and plot lines.  However, I don't think that she was heavy handed or obtuse in her creation;  she was clear.  Again, I loved this book.  It is worth your time and your thought.	2001-01-15

It is enthralling and difficult to put down.  It is well-written, and the characters are believeable and engrossing.  I found myself caring for the characters and rooting for one over the other.  The book does draw you in. However, the plot leads us on and on into what is finally a dismal abyss.  My problem is not that the final twists of the plot are implausible. My problem is that the entire ending of the book is simply miserable.  And really, I should have known.  The hallmark of Oprah's books is that they are bleak yet hopeful -- until the end, that is, when her book choices are still bleak but all hope has been unrefuteably obliterated.  So, this was a good book.  But take heed:  there is no happy ending here.  Nothing to feel good about.  No hope at all. None.  So finally, I was left unsatisfied even though it was a good read.	2001-01-10
