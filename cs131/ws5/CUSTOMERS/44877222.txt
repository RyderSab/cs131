Specifically, Lalami has accorded non-Christian and non-white writers the kind of respect and analysis not usually offered in the \\"mainstream\\" press or even most blogs, for that matter. If this were Lalami's sole contribution to the literary world, she would have much of which to be proud. But now she brings us her first book, Hope and Other Dangerous Pursuits (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill), a collection of interlocking stories, which also reflects her connections to Morocco. The structure of Lalami's collection is as elegant as it is powerful. The title story, \\"The Trip,\\" serves as a prologue where she introduces us to the four main characters who will reappear in the eight subsequent stories. It is dark and cold as four Moroccans huddle with twenty-six others in small boat-a six-meter Zodiac inflatable meant to accommodate eight people-to cross the Strait of Gibraltar. Their hope: to avoid the watchful eye of the authorities as they travel fourteen kilometers to their haven, Spain. Lalami captures with clear and revealing language the brutality of the smugglers and the desperation of their human cargo. The collection is then divided into two parts. In the first, entitled Before, we see what drove Lalami's characters to risk their lives to escape Morocco. In these stories, we see the how desperate circumstances must get before one decides to leave home, perhaps forever. In the second part of the collection (entitled After), we see how the lives of our four protagonists change after their desperate voyage across the Strait of Gibraltar. These stories will surprise the reader. We watch as lives get turned inside out with people doing things that they normally wouldn't absent distressed circumstances. And in the end, we don't know which is more dangerous: the weary acceptance of poverty and brutality or the hope-driven risks people take to make life worth the effort. Lalami wisely doesn't offer any answers. Rather, she gives us potent and perfectly-crafted portraits of those who both battle and embrace hope. And she lets us know that the lives of undocumented immigrants can't be painted with one, broad stroke their lives are as varied as anyone else's. What an auspicious debut this is. One hopes that Lalami will be telling her stories for many years to come. [The full version of this review first appeared in the literary blog, rockslinga.]	2005-09-23

Delights and Amazes	In the forward to the vibrant, sumptuous and well-researched Carnival!, Joyce Ice, Director of the Museum of International Folk Art (MOIFA), notes that festivals \\"as cultural phenomena never fail to intrigue and captivate us as human beings, whether we are casual observers, researchers, or participants.\\"  Edited by Barbara Mauldin, curator of Latin American folk art at MOIFA, Carnival! does indeed intrigue and captivate as we are plunged-through essays, photographs and illustrations-into the fascinating and diverse celebration of this important and lively Christian festival.  Carnival! focuses on communities in Spain, Mexico, Switzerland, Haiti, Bulgaria, Italy, the United States, Bolivia, Brazil, Trinidad and Tobago.  A varied and highly-qualified stable of historians, folklorists, anthropologists, linguists and curators offer well-researched and insightful essays that demonstrate how one festival could evolve into wonderfully diverse (yet similar) pre-Lenten celebrations.  Colorful photographs and illustrations capture the sizzle and sass of the parades and costumes that take center stage in each of the cultures represented in this book.  Carnival! was almost a decade in the making and it shows.  Meticulous yet soulful, scholarly yet enchanting, Carnival! delights and amazes as much as it reminds us of the astonishing diversity of the world's cultures.

The Prologue's first sentences thrust us into an almost familiar yet purely mythical world while introducing Plascencia's sly brand of humor: \\"She was made after the time of ribs and mud.  By papal decree there were to be no more people born of the ground or from the marrow of bones.  All would be created from the propulsions and mounts performed underneath bedsheets-rare exceptions granted for immaculate conceptions.\\"  What an astonishing, strange and deeply moving novel this is.  In all his playfulness, Plascencia nonetheless grapples with troubling issues of free will, religious fidelity, ethnic identity, failed love and the creative process which he melds into a dreamscape that is impossible to forget.  Plascencia-the God of his paper people-has given us a startling work of fiction that stretches not only the norms of storytelling, but also the bounds of our imagination.

Various identities grapple with each other seeking superiority and control: poor vs. middle class, Spanish vs. English, borderland vs. big city, atheist vs. believer, brown vs. white.  In \\"Bullfight,\\" this battle is a bewildering \\"river / that divides me, crosses me daily like the forgotten / history of my grandmother.\\"  The narrator has lost much of her ability to speak Spanish and \\"[e]ven the people I longed for, / la raza, forgot my face.\\"  Yet she knows that her mother, who is half Jewish, suffers this same rupture of identity: \\"Her own lost / heritage buried in a cemetery plot.\\"  But in \\"Learning to Speak,\\" she admits that something must be done despite likely cultural humiliation: \\"I spoke / Spanish broken, tongue-heavy.  I was once too proud / to speak Spanish in the barrio.... Quiero / aprender espaol, I whisper.\\"  And her would-be teacher responds without words: \\"He smiles.\\"  The risk is taken, and a reward received. <br /> <br />Luna's poems have graced the pages of some of the most prestigious literary journals published today: Prairie Schooner, The Georgia Review, Puerto del Sol, Kalliope, and many others.  A native of El Paso who now teaches in Denver, she was a finalist for the National Poetry Series book awards and the Perugia Press Intro Award for women poets.

Liffey also fell for a police officer named Gloria Ramirez, a Native American who was raised by Latino parents who taught her to hate her own heritage.  \\"Dangerous Games\\" begins with Liffey living in East L.A. with Ramirez; his moody daughter is delighted with Ramirez and hopes her father won't mess this one up.  But Liffey's relationship leads inexorably to a new search for a lost child: Ramirez's beautiful 18-year-old niece has disappeared from her tiny reservation in the Owens Valley leaving enough clues to make everyone suspect that she's been swallowed up by L.A.'s porn scene.  Liffey feels up to the task. <br /> <br />If it were left at that, our hero would have more than enough to occupy him.  But during one clear day while Liffey waters his girlfriend's lawn and Maeve lounges alongside chatting with her father, a gangbanger loses control and shoots indiscriminately in Liffey's direction leaving Maeve severely wounded.  As Maeve recuperates, Liffey adds a new mission to his list: revenge.  His subsequent confrontation of the perpetrator and eventual solution is one of the most surprising and fulfilling aspects of the narrative. <br /> <br />But there is still a lost child to find.  And this is where things get ugly as we're thrown into the world of phone sex, porn films, dangerous reality videos, AIDS and very violent men who truly believe that women are meant to be controlled and used in any way imaginable.  Throughout, we're treated to Shannon's smart dialogue, complex characters and a thrill ride of action.  The denouement takes place in the Malibu Hills, set ablaze by reality \\"filmmakers\\" as their ultimate get-rich-quick venture.  As Liffey and others try to outrun the flames, Liffey muses onall the failures in his life and wonders about the meaning of it all.  There are wonderful things in life to be certain: the love of both his girlfriend and his resilient, brilliant daughter.  But all the mistakes are there too: failed relationships, a battle with alcohol, physical scars too many to count.  In Shannon's sure hands, we see the world through the eyes of a man who struggles to reconcile life's joy and pain shaped in large part by Los Angeles itself.  Shannon offers more questions than answers.  But that's okay.  Finely-crafted novels do that.  And this is certainly one of Shannon's best. <br /> <br />[The full version of this review first appeared in The Elegant Variation.]	2005-04-28

The first eight of the 19 stories included in this collection were first published by the Arizona Quarterly between 1947 and 1950. The \\"distinctively Chicano literary space\\" Suarez created was grounded in the harsh realities of a barrio in Tucson called El Hoyo (literally \\"The Hole\\") which the editors term \\"an urban wasteland.\\" Suarez, who was also a journalist, social activist and educator who relocated his family to Southern California in 1958, possessed a sharp eye for quotidian human experience. He populated his \\"sketches\\" (his term) with preening pachucos, avuncular barbers, unrepentant womanizers, chisme-loving comadres, clever swindlers and many other examples of humanity.    Suarez did not romanticize the Chicano experience; indeed, he acknowledged such social dysfunctions as alcohol abuse (\\"Cuco Goes to a Party\\" and \\"Loco-Chu\\"), indolence (\\"Kid Zopilote\\") and economic struggle (\\"The Migrant\\" and \\"Los Coyotes\\") while celebrating the beauty of Chicano culture (\\"Mexican Heaven\\"), human kindness (\\"Dona Clara\\" and \\"Senor Garza\\") and the work ethic (\\"Something Useful, Even Tailoring\\"). Quite often, Suarez relied on biting irony and comedic juxtapositions to illustrate his characters' vices and virtues.  No collection of Chicano literature will be complete without this volume.

Aragon is also the founding editor and publisher of Momotombo Press which promotes emerging Latino writers and is housed at the Institute for Latino Studies at the University of Notre Dame where Aragon is a Visiting Fellow. His talents at translation have been utilized for a half dozen books including those by the great Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca. Aragon's honors include an Academy of American Poets Prize and an AWP Intro Journals Project Award. With Puerta del Sol, Aragon offers us his first full-length book of poetry. And it is about time.  Whether confronting terrorism on Spanish soil, memories of his late mother, or lamenting love lost, Aragon allows his images to travel from one continent to another, between English and Spanish, from hard, present tense reality to amorphous, malleable memory. Aragon's poems are stunning little mirrors that reveal the shimmering complexity of our lives and dreams. This is an eloquent collection that deserves attention.

As Jack Liffey struggles to catch the person responsible for a string of connected crimes, he falls for a police officer named Gloria Ramirez, a Native American who was raised by Latino parents who taught her to hate her own heritage. Liffey is forced to confront and eventually offer help to his viciously-bigoted father, Declan. But Liffey's Good Samaritan daughter believes that her newfound grandfather can discard his ugly beliefs by getting to know her African-American friends. Shannon also intersperses the chapters with entries from the perpetrator's diary, paralleling the investigation, giving us insight into the damaged soul's desire to redress old wrongs and bring honor back to his family that was \\"relocated\\" out of Terminal Island's once thriving Japanese fishing community during World War II. The result is a complex and compelling portrait of people linked by both place and past transgressions. In the end, we wonder if we can ever run from our former selves into a future where we are better people who can improve this world rather than tear it down. As Liffey tries to reason with the perpetrator of the crimes, he sounds as if he's trying to convince himself that forgiveness is, indeed, a great virtue: \\"[W]ar asks too much of a human being. They weren't bad people to start with, and most of them have healed. Time heals. Love heals. Work heals. The human mind is resilient, it finds a way.\\" If Jack Liffey and his father are any guide, these words have truth at their core and there is hope for us all.

In his intriguing introduction to this short dictionary of Spanglish words and phrases, he tracks not only the history of Spanish and English dictionaries, but also the political riff between Spain and English speaking countries such as Britain and the United States.  He also touchingly recounts his head-on encounter with one of his students who told Stavans that she was dropping out and returning to her barrio; she spoke very freely in Spanglish knowing that Stavans would understand what she was saying.  Though he was not able to convince her to stay, the conversation sparked something in Stavans that eventually led to the creation of this book.  Stavans admits that purists consider the very concept of a hybrid such as Spanglish repugnant and even a threat to learning proper Spanish and English, pero Spanglish vive whether we like it or not.  We can hide our collective head in the sand or acknowledge the fact that many people do speak it.  And writers who grew up hearing this blend of languages should feel free to use it in their fiction, poetry and other creative writing because it reflects reality.  Because Stavans es gran escritor y un intelectual verdadero, this book is not only engaging, it is an important step to understanding how languages evolve whether you agree with its premise or not.  I suspect that language scholars will eventually consider \\"Spanglish\\" one of the first and most important books on the subject.	2005-01-01

In Michael Jaime-Becerra's subtle and beautiful debut collection, \\"Every Night is Ladies' Night,\\" we are introduced to one such city: El Monte. Jaime-Becerra spins ten interlocking stories around the hub of El Monte, a working-class community of just over 100,000 people, the vast majority of whom are Latino. The stories bounce back-and-forth from 1984 to 1989 with one leaping thirty years further into the past. The protagonists reappear all tied to streets like Valley and Live Oak, businesses such as Road Runner Liquor, Pick-A-Part, Tortillerilla Bienvenida and the ubiquitous McDonald's. People scrape together livelihoods as mechanics, fast food managers, tattoo artists, truck drivers and musicians. We see how children, teens, parents and grandparents try desperately to fit in, keep their dreams alive, fall in love. Most of the characters we meet are members of the Cruz family. Jaime-Becerra knows that not all life experiences lead to grand epiphanies or dramatic personal growth. With great skill, he shows us that we often battle just to stay in place. This is a beautiful, accomplished debut.  (A longer version of this review appeared in Southwest BookViews.)	2004-12-09

Dysfunctional much of the time, but secure in their desire to improve themselves and find love in the right places (even if they hang around the wrong places a bit too long), Pete and Alice have every reason to disturb and rankle the other.  But within the healing orbits of an unusually honest minister (Helen) and Alice's eccentric aunt, Kate, we can rejoice in their respective baby steps toward something resembling a &quot;normal&quot; life.  Thrown into the mix is--almost literally--the ghost of William James and an assortment of Los Angeles inhabitants such as a jive-talking, white cross-dresser and a beautiful, aging movie star.

Aside from the obvious loss suffered by his family and friends (I never had the pleasure of meeting him), we wonder about the poetry and other writing he would have produced in the wake of his beautiful and accomplished collection, &quot;the iceworker sings.&quot;  Much has been written about Montoya's first book which was the winner of the 1997 Chicano/Latino Literary Prize (University of California at Irvine).  Montoya's Fresno is filled with love, lust, hate, suffering and protest sung in a clear Chicano voice.  Suffice it to say that the brutal yet eloquent honesty of Montoya's poems has assured that &quot;the iceworker sings&quot; will be read and studied for decades to come.	2004-02-01

Well, I offer this compliment to Hayden Herrera.  It is supreme understatement for me to observe that the Mexican artist, Frida Kahlo, was a complex person filled with great contradictions.  Yet, through liberal use of Frida's letters coupled with Herrera's own insightful analysis of her painting, &quot;Frida&quot; brings this great artist to life for us to bask in her brilliance, energy and strength.  &quot;Frida&quot; is one of the most remarkable, illuminating and fulfilling biographies I have ever read.

Wojnicki's prose is pregnant with full-bodied descriptions of one man's quest to be with the woman he loves/lusts after.  This slim novel bursts with the sounds, landscapes, smells and tastes of places like Poland, New York and Mexico and puts one in the mind of Hemingway and Steinbeck.

Thrown into the mix is Rose's teenage daughter who falls in love for the first time.  Though such a set up could easily lead to soap opera cliche, Stahl's great skill never allows this to happen.  Her characters are real and their reactions authentic.  Stahl also has a great gift for description particularly of Shelter Island where much of the novel takes place.  Indeed, at times I felt as though I were watching a movie: the characters, their actions and surroundings all felt so true and without contrivance.  This is a beautiful, powerful novel that raises as many questions about love and forgiveness as it answers.	2003-12-05

In a series of vignettes focusing on different characters, Gonzalez allows us into the lives and painful pasts of these workers.

Juan Delgado with his new collection &quot;A Rush of Hands&quot; is no exception.  But Delgado also addresses those simple, beautiful experiences that cross all ethnic lines.

Never saccharine, always honest, these stories will get under your skin.  Her characters range from teenagers to the elderly, people just experiencing the intricacies of life, and those who have grown jaded from years of battling the random inequities of an illogical world.  Gerber's character of Anna Goldman is worth the price of this book alone.  Without question, Gerber's fiction played an important role in my development as a writer.  This is a must read.	2003-10-21

The novel's storyline is well-known: Rechy writes of one young male hustler who wanders from El Paso to New York to Los Angeles to New Orleans meeting and experiencing male customers, drag queens, tough men and &quot;nellies.&quot;  While partaking of this life, he is also observing the pain and joy of a world filled with &quot;youngmen&quot; and those who are no longer young.  Will he find meaning in any of it?  Will he come to terms with his sexual orientation?  The answers are not clear.  But in the end it doesn't really matter.

If you're Chicano, you might recognize many of the faces and images represented here by such fine artists as John Valadez, Frank Romero, Ester Hernandez, and many others.  If you're not a member of the Chicano community, you will nonetheless be dazzled by the powerful images and colors of the culture.  The introductory essays by Max Benavidez, Constance Cortez and Tere Romo assist us in contextualizing the art that is often, but not always, steeped in the socio-political rumblings of el movimiento.

Well, I wasn't disappointed.  Because this is a mystery with a fine, surprising ending, let me just say that I enjoyed the voice of the hardened, divorced, booze-loving protagonist, Luis Montez, a solo practitioner who finds his old friends from El Movimiento - the Chicano political movement - dying all around him.  Throw in a beautiful, mysterious Chicana and things really start hopping.  This short, tight novel will keep you guessing until the last pages.  I highly recommend this book.	2003-07-15

He impressed me with his thoughtful and eloquent answers to the various questions from the small but intense audience.  So, I bought his book, &quot;At the Rainbow,&quot; and I'm delighted I did.  His poems are rooted primarily in three things: his identity as a Chicano, his status as a Californian, and the natural world presented by the California terrain.  One of my favorite poems is &quot;California Sonnets: Night Sequence,&quot; where Vasquez paints a picture of Los Altos, California: &quot;I look up at the night's broad back/gone crazy with tattoos of light, seasonal/signs almost beyond stoppage, and let/the unsayable build skyward.&quot;  Or in &quot;Coyotes&quot; where Vasquez remembers that as a child, he found &quot;a carcass, split open/and shelled of all gray/sponge-like organs, the heart/and lungs gone from this vest/of coyote....&quot;  This is a finely-crafted, powerful collection that will create living images of California in your mind's eye.	2003-07-10

His short fiction gives us unvarnished glimpses into the lives of Chicanos who suffer from the same type of struggles except this time in their day-to-day attempts - often futile - to draw some meaning from life or even death.  This is an essential book for Latinos who have taken that crazy, unreasonable step to become writers.

I didn't know the author but the story moved me with its powerful, poignant portrait of two lost souls: a woman who had lost her mind (known in the neighborhood as, \\"La Loquita\\") and Rafael, the lonely, owner of the tiendita. When I started to read Richard Yaez's debut collection, \\"El Paso del Norte: Stories on the Border,\\" I was delighted when I came upon \\"Lucero's Mkt.\\" It sat happily nestled among the other borderland stories in this slim, eloquent and vibrant collection. Yaez has a gift: he can bring to life one region in Texas (near the Mexican border) but he doesn't write the same story over and over again. The characters range across the map of Latino experiences: undocumented immigrants, pochos, young, old, male, female, middle-class, indigent. Yaez never falls in the trap known as bathos. He paints an honest picture of life on the border without pulling punches. But he also shows respect for the people he writes about even those who are riddled with imperfections.

Thrown into the mix is the holdover Salvador, an undocumented Mexican, who worked for the previous owners.  Though technically not much happens, the characters go through major life changes as they confront their own and others expectations in matters of culture, language and the work ethic.  The most compelling relationship is between Place -- who feels a bit like a &quot;pocho&quot; because of his poor Spanish and &quot;Americanized&quot; ways of thinking -- and Salvador who is both amused and confounded by Place's ability to be in two cultures at once.  With the help of Place, Salvador becomes more a part of the United States.  Conversely, Salvador helps Place with his Spanish.  Rivera is masterful at painting believeable characters who are not unlike ourselves.  And his meticulous descriptions of Sonoma County's terrain and climate bring that part of California alive.  On top of it, I learned so much about the practicalities of running a ranch from irrigation to medicating cattle.  This is a very fine book.	2003-01-26

In two dozen essays, we not only learn about the great obstacles inherent in starting a literary journal, we see how Lesser developed as a reader and observer.  This is a delightful read filled with Lesser's wonderful observations on love, art and publishing.  I highly recommend this book.	2002-06-08

In &quot;Aching Knees in Palm Springs,&quot; the young narrator recounts working for his father, a gardener, at a large house in Palm Springs:<br />We spent our vacations in shivers--<BR>Raking, trimming, and mowing<BR>Frosted gardens with Dad.<BR>At the eighth hour of kneeling<BR>And picking, the weight on my knees<BR>Was too much for me to continue.<BR>So every time I pulled out a fistful of grass,<BR>I stood up tall and stretched,<BR>The cold air sneaking under my shirt.<br />In &quot;Love Simple,&quot; the narrator remembers his first love that &quot;occurred between/The ninth and tenth grade--/My first girlfriend--/And boy!  Did it come with perks!/She fed me the burritos/My few hungry dimes couldn't buy.&quot;  Here, because of the narrator's near poverty, both love and food become intertwined into one, all-embracing meal for both body and soul.<br />What I enjoyed most about this collection is the author's refusal to sugarcoat his childhood.  We hear his anger towards his father, we hear the pain of growing up without much money.  But there is joy, as well, though meager.  This is a beautiful and truthful collection.  I highly recommend it.	2002-05-29

Books	5	41	46	N	N	Still Running	So much has been written about this powerful, truthful and inspiring memoir by Luis J. Rodriguez that I doubt that I could offer anything to add to the book's understanding and appreciation.  But of all the professional reviews, the most telling critiques come from the high school students and teachers some of which are printed in the first two pages of the most recent edition of &quot;Always Running.&quot;  One student, Johnny Mendez, offers the chilling but hope-filled words: &quot;History repeats itself and we must make some changes.&quot;  These words are chilling because Rodriguez writes of events from the 60s and 70s yet a high school student of today sees the same despair, neglect and fear that existed a generation earlier.  The hope we see is in the high school student's resolve: &quot;[W]e must make some changes.&quot;  Rodriguez has just opened a bookstore in Sylmar, California, named after his wonderful and misunderstood aunt, Tia Chucha, where he hopes to reach out to Latino youth to help them find a path towards full and productive lives.  The fight continues.  And this book still speaks the truth, eloquently and to all.	2002-04-06

I had just learned of the new publisher of poetry, Swan Scythe Press, and ordered several of its chapbooks.  The first one I read was Maria Melendez's \\"Base Pairs.\\"  I was immediately caught up by Melendez's unusual rhythm and word-use in the first stanza of the first poem, \\"The Bothered-By-Questions Method\\":<br />\\"How do you tell the difference?\\" \\"Lunate scar within the ligule<BR>                              signals Great Basin witch grass.\\"<BR>(The new-moon birthmark on his underarm--)<BR>                                   \\"Am I prying?\\"<br />As you can see, we are immediately thrown into a conversation with words that seem both familiar yet strange.  Where is Melendez taking us?  What is she telling us?  We are sucked into her world in this way.  She mixes in a few prose-poems such as \\"Sensing Home: Aural\\" where easy vernacular tells us a story of culture with concise beauty.  My favorite poem is \\"In Birute's Camp,\\" a fearsome telling of the rape of a researcher's assistant by a male ex-captive orangutan.<br />These poems are not meant to lull and comfort the reader.  Melendez offers us powerful, evocative and surprising language to tell important stories, stories about life and all its shadows.  She also offers the reader a nice feature: She ends her chapbook with notes on selected poems to give a bit of background to help us know a little about where some of her ideas come from.  This is a beautiful, enchanting little book.	2002-02-17

For those of us who are aspiring writers or simply lovers of literature, this book offers wonderfully fun, odd and always interesting insights into the minds of such fine writers as Sherman Alexie, Brenda Hillman, David Rains Wallace and Ethan Canin, to name a few of the sixteen authors presented here.  These glimpses into the writers' notebooks show how personal and idiosyncratic the creative process is: we see sketches, first drafts, outlines, newspaper clippings, interlineated text, etc.  Mr. Junker, in his introduction, observes that the &quot;notebooks are notoriously raw, uncooked sometimes to the point of illegibility&quot; requiring footnote translations &quot;for the most egregious practitioners of bad penmanship [such as] Gerald Vizenor and Charles Johnson.&quot;  Well, that's the charm of this joyous collection.  Each excerpt of notebooks includes a short introduction from the writer him/herself which adds nicely to our understanding of how these writers work.  I highly recommend this book.	2002-01-04

Her goal is, in some ways, modest: to bring new Canadian, Mexican and U.S. writing to readers of English and Spanish.  The execution of this goal, however, cannot be dismissed as simple.  Anyone who has read different translations of the same work realizes that a bad translation can suck the soul out of a fine piece of literature.  Here, with works translated either from English to Spanish, or vice versa, nothing is lost.  This first issue of Tameme includes short stories, poems and essays by such wonderful writers as Margaret Atwood, Juan Villoro and Jaime Sabines, to name a few of the many authors featured.  My favorite piece is &quot;New York Day Women,&quot; by Edwidge Danticat, but there is something here for everyone.  If you love literary journals, this one is a must.	2002-01-04

The grace, care and loving attention she gave to my simple lines -- communicated through several e-mails -- confirmed in my heart what my mind already knew: Ms. Mora is one of our literary treasures.  &quot;Aunt Carmen's Book of Practical Saints&quot; puts her joy of language on perfect display.  In poems that resonate regardless of your religious beliefs, she shows how one can communicate joy, sorrow and hopes through prayer to various &quot;santos/as&quot; who are shown here in beautiful photographs of statues and paintings.  This is a handsomely-produced volume of heart-felt, finely-crafted poetry from one of our finest poets.  I also enjoyed Ms. Mora's &quot;code switching&quot; -- i.e., mixing Spanish with English -- which gives the poems a wonderful flavor.  It is a joy to read.	2001-12-23

Eileen Myles doesn't play this game. Memories of sexual experiences, horrible jobs, too much booze, and a family life that doesn't resemble reruns of Ozzie and Harriet spill onto the page without artifice and without regard for chronology. The result is a dizzying, beautiful, tough and honest view into one woman's life. I couldn't stop turning the pages as I wandered deeper into Ms. Myles's memories and connected, at times, with her sense of displacement.  There's also much humor in this book: Ms. Myles has an ability to paint scenes of her Catholic school experiences that can make you laugh out loud.  More authors should write this honestly.	2001-10-17

Alcala's language is clear, evocative and, at times, heart-wrenching as she tells this story of diaspora, lost family connections and personal discovery. One of the most moving chapters (titled, &quot;The Girl in the Closet&quot;) is Alcala at her best as she captures the almost overwhelming fears of a woman beaten down by the sexual transgressions of her employer: &quot;If I just stay here, I will be fine. Before I shut the door, I got a box of crackers from the kitchen, so I will be fine.&quot; This is a powerful novel.	2001-08-24

And it is a remarkable collection at that.  There are thirteen stories here, six of which had never been published before.  The editor, Professor John F. Callahan, did a fine job at choosing the stories to be included, and he describes the fascinating selection process in the book's introduction.  Professor Callahan includes three early Buster-and-Riley stories which inspired me to write my short story, &quot;Los Angeles, 1970&quot; (Outsider Ink at: [...]  The Buster-and-Riley stories capture the wonderful and lively banter between the two boys while showing how the racism of the real world touches and affects their childhood.  There is also &quot;A Party Down at the Square&quot; which is a chilling story told in the first person by a white boy who witnesses the burning of an African-American man.  Each story is well-crafted and powerful in its understatement.  Ellison's graceful and evocative language paints a picture of human strength and frailty with the same honest, unflinching brush.  Though he is best remembered for his novel, &quot;Invisible Man,&quot; this collection demonstrates that he was also a brilliant craftsman of the short story.	2001-08-17

When I started writing fiction a few years ago, I knew that I couldn't enter an MFA program because I'm a full-time attorney with a family to feed and a mortgage to pay.  So, I decided that I should read as much fiction as possible to help teach myself the craft of writing.  One of the books I purchased was the then-new 1998 Prize Stories: The O'Henry Awards.  I couldn't have made a better choice!  In this one volume, I read Lorrie Moore's heartbreaking &quot;People Like That Are the Only People Here,&quot; Steven Millhauser's chilling &quot;The Knife Thrower,&quot; Alice Munro's evocative &quot;The Children Stay,&quot; among many other wonderful and powerful fiction from The New Yorker, Zoetrope: All-Story, Ploughshares, Harper's, and others.  Larry Dark, the series editor, and the prize jury, Andrea Barrett, Mary Gaitskill and Rick Moody, did a wonderful job pulling together the best short fiction of that year.

I was a little concerned about the age difference between the two as well as the fact that Anne could be abusing her power with an undergraduate. Once I got over these hurdles (and we shouldn't ignore them...what if Anne were a Walter?), I fell under the spell of their love and Flannery's not-so-surprising heartbreak.

Present are Bender's trademarks: obsessive characters, whimsical situations, witty dialogue, and so much symbolism that you don't know where to begin deciphering her messages.

Her mother is a travel agent who has never traveled, her father a man suffering from a mysterious, gray disease.  Mona's second grade class is filled with odd, energetic and talkative tikes.

Bernard Cooper's collection of short stories is one of the easiest and funniest reads you'll ever encounter.  This is remarkable not because Cooper doesn't have the literary talent.  He has it in buckets.  What's remarkable is that Cooper's stories, at their core, deal with some rather heartbreaking realities of gay life in America: the ravages of AIDS, homophobia, men and women searching for or creating their identity within a culture that pushes them to the side and says, we are normal, you are not.  Cooper tells us of the married Mormon who realizes he's gay but has been counseled by the church's elders to fight these impulses and seek the company of men.  He decides to follow his advice and throw a party for every gay male he and his skeptical wife know.  A man dying of AIDS decides to add color and style to his neighbors' lives by sneaking out at night and putting up tasteful porchlights, rearranging plants, and painting garage doors and walls.  His partner is mortified by this artistic vigilantism and doesn't know how to stop him.  Certainly, a couple of the stories are not funny such as &quot;X&quot; where we find a young man numbing his senses with drugs as he recalls his first touch with homophobia.<br />I was surprised to find that I had already read several of these stories in various literary journals over the past several years.  Despite this, I enjoyed re-reading them and realized that Cooper is not only a fine writer, he is a master at describig the human condition in such a way that gay or straight readers will identify with the characers on some level.  This is a wonderful book.	2001-06-10

Things we dare not talk about.  Things we should talk about but we tell ourselves that we don't have the strength to confront our own words.  A couple loses their only child to SIDS after years of trying to conceive.  A divorced mother sleeps with her teenage daughter's boyfriend.  A woman meets with her ex-husband, on the sly, to hear him complain about his new, young wife, and to enjoy intimacy.  A young woman is stalked by a silent, obsessed man from the old country.  Despite such topics, Louis uses well-crafted, poetic and subtle language to tell her stories.  She infuses Chinese cultural elements gently but without hesitation.  This is a truly beautiful collection of fiction that I recommend to all who care about language and our daily struggle to make sense out of things that happen to us.	2001-06-01

Gilb doesn't spare us when he allows his male characters to delve deeply into their obsessions with the opposite sex.  In &quot;Maria de Covina,&quot; the first story in the collection, a young Chicano (nineteen but he thinks he passes for twenty) simply tells us: &quot;This is the thing: I like women.  No, wait.  I love women.&quot;  In &quot;The Pillows,&quot; the male protagonist, Jorge, thinks he figured out why his pocho friend, Danny, is having women problems: the only pillows he owns are old, raggedy and dirty.  Jorge is obsessed about this particularly while housesitting for Danny.  Jorge tells his own girlfriend: &quot;I can't imagine a woman getting in a bed with those pillows.  I can't imagine a woman wanting to, even to take a nap.&quot;  Some of the stories are heartbreaking, like &quot;Shout,&quot; where poverty pushes a man to be abusive to his wife and children; even here, there is a glimmer of hope, hope based on love of women.  Gilb is a master at ambiguities, our ambiguities as people searching for companionship.  The only bad thing about this book is that it is too short (a mere 167 pages).<br />Much praise is also due to the artist, Artemio Rodriguez, who illustrated each story with linocuts (similar to woodcuts); these illustrations capture the wonder, danger and craziness of loving women too much.	2001-05-11

Messerli spoke of his giddy discovery that the copyright on many of Barnes' short stories had run so he had the legal right to publish them. Though Barnes apparently was not pleased by this, this collection is the result. And God bless the result. These fourteen tales (puntuated by Barne's own strange and evocative pen-and-ink illustrations) should be read by anyone who loves well-crafted, provative short fiction; and it should be a must for those who are beginning writers. The first sentence of each story introduces you to a world where everyday people and things transmute inexplicably into something weird and dreamlike: &quot;Every Saturday, just as soon as she had slipped her manila pay envelope down her neck, had done up her handkerchiefs and watered the geraniums, Paprika Johnson climbed onto the fire-escape and reached across the strings of her pawnshop banjo.&quot; (From &quot;Paprika Johnson.&quot;) Sometimes, she sets the stage simply as with the first line of &quot;What Do You See, Madam?&quot;: &quot;Mamie Saloam was a dancer.&quot; As Messerli notes in the introduction, Barnes' stories were published in newspapers at a time (the first two decades of the 1900s) when the public expected to see short fiction in such venues. Reading this collection can only make you long for such an era.	2001-04-08

I was lucky enough to have one of my poems accepted for this beautiful anthology of poems by Latina/o writers honoring mothers and grandmothers.  But, setting aside my small contribution (I receive no royalties...I've already been paid!), this beautifully produced collection not only includes work from some of our most treasured Latina/o writers (Virgil Suarez, Pat Mora, Judith Ortiz Cofer, Francisco X. Alarcon, to name a few of the thirteen contributors), but each poem is handsomely illustrated by Ecuadorian artist, Paula Barragan, who uses bright, inviting colors and images that draw both young and old into each poem.  Because most of the authors use a little Spanish, the book includes an easy-to-read glossary with a pronunciation key. Despite being aimed at the younger reader, adults will enjoy this collection as they read it to their children because each poem will conjure up memories of the love, joy and comfort given by mothers and grandmothers.

Novas correctly notes through chapter topics that Latinos are not monolithic but, rather, are made up of numerous cultures each with different dialects, foods, music, politics, history, etc.  She answers such questions as what's a bracero, who was Cesar Chavez, what are mariachis, and offers interesting, straight-forward answers.  As a Chicano, I learned much about other Latinos (and a little about my own culture).  This is an enjoyable and educational book.	2001-04-06

Not just a &quot;Chicano/a Classic,&quot; but a book that rightfully is included in school curricula throughout the United States. This heartbreaking coming of age novella is presented in short but powerful chapters. Esperanza Cordero (note: &quot;esparanza&quot; means &quot;hope&quot;; &quot;cordero&quot; means &quot;lamb&quot;) is about a young girl in a poor Latino neighborhood who tells us her story in vignettes. One of the most moving chapters is &quot;Red Clowns&quot; where Esparanza tells her friend Sally about being raped at the carnival: &quot;Sally Sally a hundred times. Why didn't you hear me when I called? Why didn't you tell them to leave me alone? The one who grabbed me by the arm, he wouldn't let me go. He said I love you, Spanish girl, I love you, and pressed his sour mouth to mine.&quot; This short chapter displays the beauty and potency of Cisneros's prose: she uses simple language, that of a young girl, and juxtaposes the child-like world of the carnival with the adult ugliness of rape. This a moving, well-crafted book that should be on your list of &quot;must reads.&quot;	2001-04-06

For example, in Soto's essay, &quot;The Shirt,&quot; he shows how the tragic, post-Korean War existence of Uncle Shorty seemed magical and special to a young Soto who covets his uncle's shirt: &quot;I used to slip it on when he was asleep, and at the age of five I knew the smell of a man who went and came back from war....It was the shape of muscle, the anger of a tattoo panther hiding behind cotton, the hair in the collar, the small hole where a bullet could have entered and exited without his dying.&quot; Or, with the simple first line of &quot;The Weather,&quot; Soto can set the stage for the mysteries of climate: &quot;January doesn't show its true face until you can scratch a cold window with a finger.&quot;  This little book will make you smile (and sometimes wince) as it brings back your own personal memories of growing up. This is a wonderful collection that offers everyone, including new writers, a chance to enjoy and learn from beautifully crafted essays.	2001-04-04

(My story, &quot;Bender,&quot; was published in Volume 18 of The Pacific Review (spring 2000) ... Ms. Bender is not in the story despite its title.)  She is a writer's writer who can weave fabulist fiction into seductive, complex knots.  The joy comes from trying to untie these knots but, just when you think you've got it, another thread appears out of nowhere.  Thank you, Ms. Bender, wherever you are!	2001-04-04
