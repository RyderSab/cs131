John Keegan needs no introduction to those interested in military history.  He is a graduate of Sandhurst, the British equivalent of West Point, for years has written columns for the London Daily Telegraph, and has written a number of excellent histories on military topics.  His reputation as a military writer was made by his first book, \\"The Face of Battle\\", but many of his subsequent books have been well-regarded best-sellers. <br /> <br />This particular book comes in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and the U.S. War on Terror, and is a consideration of the historical role intelligence has played in military operations.  He illustrates his theme with a number of examples, beginning with Nelson's attempt to intercept the invasion fleet sent to Egypt by Napoleon, followed by Stonewall Jackson's Valley Campaign, the 1914 naval battles of Coronel and the Falkland Islands, the German invasion of Crete in 1941, the battles of Midway and the Atlantic, and the WWII German secret weapons programs.  He uses his examples to illustrate the way technology has influenced information gathering, and the way military commanders have used that information. <br /> <br />His tone is a little different here than in his previous books, especially in the the introduction.  He seems irritable, as though he is expecting a fight.  He sets up several straw men and false dichotomies.  For example he states, \\"Decision in war is always the result of a fight, and in combat willpower always counts for more than foreknowledge.  Let those who disagree show otherwise.\\" <br /> <br />First of all, sometimes wars are won by the THREAT of a fight.  The Cold War comes to mind, but there are other examples.  Secondly, BOTH foreknowledge and willpower are important.  Willpower alone will not always prevail, just as foreknowledge alone is not always sufficient.  Most military authorities, including Keegan himself in other contexts, would respond to this challenge by saying, \\"It's not one or the other; both are important,\\" as are many other factors.  Keegan seems to be arguing with someone here, but it only becomes clear at the end of the book who that someone is. <br /> <br />This tone occurs again in his analysis of the use of intelligence by U.S. forces at the Battle of Midway.  It has always been widely acknowledged that American foreknowledge of Japanese intentions was a crucial part of that stunning U.S. victory.  Keegan seems to feel that he has to \\"debunk\\" that idea, and so devalues the real contribution intelligence made to victory at Midway.  Of course, no one has attributed that victory SOLELY to intelligence.  The credit for victory ultimately belongs to Spruance, for his willingness to throw all his forces into the attack at the crucial moment, and then to later avoid Nagumo's offer of a night action as a follow-up, where U.S. forces would have been at a distinct disadvantage.  Nagumo's decision-making was as poor as Spruance's was good.  The factor of luck also has to be thrown into the mix:  With a few crucial changes, Midway could as easily have turned into an American disaster equal in the event to that suffered by the Japanese. <br /> <br />The biggest weakness of the book is that Keegan downplays the role of leadership.  This is quite a change, since some of his best books, particularly \\"The Mask of Command\\", have focused particularly on the importance of leadership. <br /> <br />In his last pages we see what is on Keegan's mind:  The over-emphasis of the importance of intelligence that has accompanied the American response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11.  In the end he succeeds very well in making his point that intelligence is not enough.  Polish cryptanalysts took the first steps toward breaking the German Enigma code, yet the Poles were unable to defend themselves against German armored forces with their brave but tactically and technically out-dated military forces.  As he says in his conclusion:  \\"Foreknowledge is no protection against disaster.  Even real-time intelligence is never real enough.  Only force finally counts.  As the civilised states begin to chart their way through the wasteland of a universal war on terrorism without foreseeable end, may their warriors shorten their swords.  Intelligence can sharpen their gaze.  The ability to strike sure will remain the best protection against the cloud of unknowing prejudice and ignorance that threatens the laws of enlightenment.\\" <br /> <br />I think Keegan put it better in one of his columns shortly after 9/11, when he stated that the only way to deal with the terrorists is to \\"frighten them into passivity.\\" <br /> <br />It is clear that Keegan has written this book with the debate on terrorism in mind.  Do we need to conciliate and appease those who have declared themselves to be our enemies, as some would advise, or do we follow Keegan's advice?  I think Keegan holds up his side of the debate rather well.	2005-07-25

This is a beautiful book. <br /> <br />My first reaction to reading it was envy:  Envy that her family had the means to send her to a Swiss boarding school to absorb French language and culture.  Envy that she has been able to devote her professional life to the study of such a beautiful and absorbing subject.  And envy at the precision of her language, and the equal precision of her insight into herself.  She is a very intelligent and strong-willed person, but she isn't arrogant.  She seems to appreciate that her relationship with the French language is a gift, and she has done her best to use it well.  I'm sure she is an excellent teacher, compassionate and understanding of her students.  By the end of the book, I came to realize that she has had her share of pain, loneliness, and unhappiness, just like all the rest of us.  But I still envy her. <br /> <br />The author's relationship with the French language is, as one might expect, complicated.  As she tells us how she came to be a teacher of French, we learn much else:  Of her childhood, her father and his premature death, and its effect on her; of her first immersion in the French language at a Swiss boarding school; of her boyfriends, her cigarette smoking, her willfulness and her anger.  We also learn about the relationship between post-WWII French politics and the literature of the French fascists, of Louis-Ferdinand Celine, and also Drieu La Rochelle, Bardeche, and Brasillach.  We learn about her experiences with Paul de Man at Yale, her disillusion when he was exposed as having been a Nazi sympathizer during the war.  We learn of her experiences teaching the Capretz method, and of her search for the perfect French \\"r\\". <br /> <br />This complicated story is told with great economy and precision, as one would expect of someone who has spent her adult life immersed in French language and literature.  Her style is completely lucid and transparent.  Her descriptions flow off the page seamlessly into the mind'seye.  And although we learn quite a lot about the author, we learn only as much as we need to know in order to understand how she came to teach French, and no more.  In this she is very French. <br /> <br />So far as I can tell, there is no French translation of \\"French Lessons\\", although Kaplan's book on the Brasillach trial has been translated.  I would guess that \\"French Lessons\\" would be very difficult to translate adequately into French.	2005-07-20

His publisher didn't like it, most of the critics didn't like it, the former members of the Brook Farm didn't like it, D.H. Lawrence mocked it.  John Updike does his best to point out the redeeming features of the novel, even becomes a bit hysterical, calling Zenobia a \\"Gorgon before whom Coverdale stands transfixed and fascinated.\\"  He praises Hawthorne's use of local color, trying to make \\"The Blithedale Romance\\" into something more than it is. <br /> <br />So, it is not Hawthorne's best novel, according to the critics.  It doesn't stand up to \\"The House of the Seven Gables\\", let alone \\"The Scarlet Letter\\", the two other Hawthorne novels I have read. <br /> <br />Still, reading it is a worthwhile experience.  As Updike says, some of the scenes are very evocative.  The carriage ride out to the farm in an April snow storm (compare with a modern Boston commuter's experience!), the farmhouse kitchen scene, the woods around the farm, Coverdale's Boston hotel, the search for Zenobia's drowned body; all are memorable demonstrations of Hawthorne's descriptive powers. <br /> <br />Of the characters, only Zenobia and Coverdale seem like real people.  The rest are \\"types\\" or only half-sketched. <br /> <br />The worst aspect of the novel is the plot.  Of course it is written from Coverdale's point of view, so we only know what Coverdale knows, but still the denouement makes no sense.  Compared to the suicide of Emma Bovary, for example, which is perhaps an unfair comparison, the suicide of Zenobia seems completely out of character.  One can almost understand D.H. Lawrence's unsympathetic \\"Boo-hoo!\\" at the end of his review of \\"The Blithedale Romance\\".   <br /> <br />Hawthorne writes beautifully.  Telling the story from the point of view of a character who has limited knowledge foreshadows in a way the techniques used by later novelists like Joyce and Woolf.  He was also no doubt trying to create an atmosphere of mystery and intrigue.  But his technique hadn't progressed far enough to make the experiment a success, and he leaves us with too many dangling plot threads and half-formed characters.  It is an admirable experiment, if looked at in this way, but it fails to come fully to life.	2005-07-13

Niall Ferguson is an economic historian who is very good at writing for the general public.  He tends to take conservative positions, and positions that are deliberately provocative.  He also enjoys using irony, the \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" approach, and is a proponent of what is called \\"counter-factual\\" history, the \\"what-if\\" school of historical writing. <br /> <br />This book, a sequel of sorts to his previous book on the British Empire, identifies what he calls the American \\"Empire\\", and then attempts to justify it as a good thing for the world.  He makes a number of very good points in the process. <br /> <br />- America since its independence has been an expansionist power. <br />- We have tended to deny or ignore our expansionist tendencies, or attribute them to self-defense. <br />- We don't have a very good track record of exporting democracy.  He points to the long list of American failures, from the Philippine Insurrection to Vietnam to substantiate this point. <br />- Our successes, which he limits to Japan, Germany, and South Korea, were occupied by us for many years, and still contain substantial numbers of American troops. <br /> <br />He is able to identify America as an \\"empire\\" by stretching the definition of \\"empire\\" quite a bit, but he makes a valid point.  American influence is global, backed by overwhelming military power, technological sophistication, and cultural magnetism. <br /> <br />He then makes his case for the benefits of what he calls \\"liberal\\" empire.  I would summarize the concept as basically that of forcing good government on unruly foreigners, whether they want it or not.  And he adds that the world would be better off if we could do this without so much hand-wringing.  He correctly identifies the Europeans as being demoralized, unwilling and almost incapable of defending themselves.  And he correctly shows that the decolonization movement of the past 40 years has been a failure. <br /> <br />He rightly states that empires usually die from within.  He doesn't see any external threat on the horizon capable of destroying America's power.  He considers Muslim terrorism to be a transient and relatively minor threat, and considers China likewise to be a \\"hollow threat\\".  He says America's internal weaknesses are its lack of able administrators for its overseas \\"empire\\", its fiscal indiscipline, and its lack of interest in having an empire, and that these will result inevitably in the decline of American power. <br /> <br />Ferguson says he likes empires, especially \\"liberal\\" empires, and therefore considers the last named weakness the most serious one.  Empires have seldom been maintained for very long when the imperial power has lost interest in doing so.  However, all is not lost if the US retreats from its position as the world's hegemonic power.  Ferguson thinks that it is quite likely that the world would become \\"a-polar\\", rather than \\"multipolar\\", with no major power interested in or able to mount a major threat to any other major power. <br /> <br />In many ways, Ferguson makes the same points that Noam Chomsky so numbingly expounds, but unlike Chomsky, Fergsuon is a good writer and, as noted above, he LIKES the idea of an American Empire.  He just wishes we would do a better job of it than we have so far. <br /> <br />Although Ferguson is a good writer, the book shows signs of having been put together rather hurriedly. <br /> <br />There are two major weaknesses in Ferguson's argument.  The first is a conceptual one, and it applies not only to this book but to Ferguson's work in general, illustrated by his interest in \\"counterfactual\\" history.  The historian's primary duty is to TELL US WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.  That is usually a very difficult task, more than sufficient for most historians.  Ferguson is more interested in telling us what COULD happen in the future, or what COULD HAVE happened in the past, if only such and such had happened.  Thus Ferguson easily slips into wishful thinking andsloppy analysis, as in the looseness of his definition of \\"empire\\" at the very beginning of the book. <br /> <br />The second major weakness, and I consider it a very serious one, is that he never asks the first question an American would ask:  What's in it for America?  A case can be made, as it was by Woodrow Wilson in 1918, that America's security depends on the spread of democracy and freedom around the world.  This is a debatable concept.  Some would say that we would be more secure if we just minded our own business, or if we became Socialist.  In any case, this is the most important aspect of the whole issue, in my opinion, one that Ferguson hardly considers.  In the end, therefore, \\"Colossus\\", while an interesting read, is rather pointless.	2005-07-08
US	47014068	R2GAIYJFTZROYC	0684855674	684726721	Does America Need a Foreign Policy? : Toward a Diplomacy for the 21st Century	Books	4	3	4	N	N	The question answers itself.	This is the only book of Prof. Kissinger's that I have read, and I have to say that I am not as impressed by it as I thought I would be.  There is no doubt about his intelligence and wide range of knowledge, but he has the diplomat's habit of getting bogged down in the details and in the process forgetting his main point.  Here is the final paragraph in the book:    \\"While traditional patterns are in transition and the very basis of experience and knowledge is being revolutionized, America's ultimate challenge is to transform its power into moral consensus, promoting its values not by imposition but by their willing acceptance in a world that, for all its seeming resistance, desperately needs enlightened leadership.\\"    Well, yes, and, as Rodney King said, \\"Why can't we all just get along?\\"    Content aside, the above quotation is a one-sentence paragraph containing 52 words, a typical sample of Kissinger's turgid, unimaginative, and bureaucratic prose style.  One can almost hear his droning accent as one tries to follow these interminable ramblings.    So:  His style is abysmal and his conclusions either naive or disingenuous.  He KNOWS we live in a world dominated by force, that platitudes are not going to keep us safe and secure, and that perhaps even the SEARCH for safety and security is a chase after rainbows.  As a long-time advocate of realism in foreign policy he should be able to come up with something with a little more depth than this.    In spite of these defects this book is well worth reading.  Although the first six chapters, the bulk of the book, are primarily an indictment of Bill Clinton's foreign policy (or lack thereof), the last chapter contains two very helpful and informative discussions.    The first section of this chapter is a review of the basic historical approaches to American foreign policy, which he has identified as \\"Hamiltonian\\", \\"Jacksonian\\", and \\"Wilsonian\\".  The \\"Hamiltonian\\" is a tradition of practical balance-of-power maneuver advocated most vigorously in the early years of our Republic by Alexander Hamilton, whose first concern was to make sure America avoided being trapped and destroyed by the military monarchies then ruling Europe.  The \\"Jacksonian\\" tradition, named for President Andrew Jackson, more or less corresponds with Isolationism as advocated and practised for most of the 19th century and during the interwar years of the 20th century.  It was a reflection of the development of American self-confidence and relative geographical isolation from the wars of Europe.  The \\"Wilsonian\\" tradition, originating with Woodrow Wilson, has been the major influence on American foreign policy since WWII.  It aspires to make the world over in America's liberal democratic image.  The speeches of George W. Bush could easily have been delivered by Wilson himself.  And the Democrats, who are now so viciously attacking Bush and his policies, when in power have been vigorous advocates of the Wilsonian approach.    When Kissinger himself was in power and responsible for liquidating the American position in Vietnam, it seems to me he followed a pretty orthodox \\"Hamiltonian\\", not to say \\"Machiavellian\\", approach to foreign policy.  It is therefore surprising to hear him sounding so Wilsonian in this book.  One has to wonder if he is being sincere.  Nevertheless, he knows his  subject and presents it well.    The last section of the last chapter, on Universal Jurisdiction, is also very well done.  In the preceding chapter he reviews the basic motivations and concepts of the Treaty of Westphalia, that in 1648 stopped the barbaric blood-letting of the Thirty Years' War.  He then shows how the recent preoccupation with Universal Human Rights, and especially the setting up of the International Criminal Court in 1998, completely overturns the settlement so painfully reached at Westphalia.  (It should be noted that Westphalia is a province of Germany.  The treaty is named after a province because the parties tothe treaty were too hostile to meet in the same city.)  Of course, as many have pointed out, Kissinger has a dog in this fight.  Serious proposals have been made by his political enemies to prosecute him for war crimes, much as Pinochet was indicted by Spain and arrested in Britain for \\"crimes against humanity\\" that occurred in Chile.  Kissinger, however, is not the only person whose personal security is placed at risk by this new and intensely idealistic focus on transnational prosecutions.  Under this doctrine all American military and diplomatic personnel serving overseas are potentially liable to criminal prosecution by third parties for actions taken in the line of their official duties.  Kissinger rightly points out that this unprecedented development has the potential to massively increase the difficulty of America's pursuit of its national security in a dangerous world.    In summary, this book doesn't live up to its title.  However, it should be read for Kissinger's description of the major historical trends of American foreign policy and for his analysis of the doctrine of Universal Jurisdiction.	2005-07-08

This book is typical Chomsky:  Full of special pleading, sarcastic innuendo, and butchery of the English language.  He rides  his same old hobbyhorse, that America is the major source of evil in the world.  He claims to have a sense of humor, but there's no evidence of it in this book, or any of his others.  In spite of (or perhaps because of) being a linguist, he has an atrocious, awkward, obtuse writing style.   <br /> <br />The grain of truth in this book is that America is indeed seeking world domination, although perhaps not deliberately.  Whether or not this is good for either America or the world is a very interesting question, but it is one that you will not see discussed in this book.  Chomsky has already made the decision for you:  America is evil, and therefore American domination of the world is evil.  Every word in this book is designed to foster that belief. <br /> <br />His solution to this problem of \\"American evil\\" is socialist revolution.  He has said that he doesn't advocate violence, so I suppose he would be satisfied with a democratically elected Socialist government.  Perhaps a Socialist America would be a \\"good\\" America, in Chomsky's terms, or perhaps not.  Whatever the case, such a regime would be unlikely to tolerate self-appointed \\"gadflies\\".   <br /> <br />America has been very good to Noam.  In typical Leftist intellectual fashion he has expressed his gratitude by biting the hand that feeds him, by attacking the very system that protects his freedom to be who he is.   <br /> <br />If you like that kind of thing, you will love this book.	2005-06-21

The word that keeps coming to mind as I think about this book is \\"charming\\".  Melville was in a good mood when he wrote \\"Omoo\\", no doubt enjoyed looking back on a very pleasurable period of his still-young life.  While it is true that \\"Omoo\\" wasn't nearly as successful as \\"Typee\\" had been, it is still an impressive work for a young man in his mid-twenties. <br /> <br />I enjoyed his portraits of the people he meets, and especially of his doctor friend, \\"Long Ghost\\".  His descriptions of Polynesian life and the historical context are quite interesting.  And it's funny:  Melville had very good sense of humor, displays it throughout \\"Omoo\\".    <br /> <br />While the book is mainly a picaresque story of adventure, recounting the details of daily life in an exotic setting, and is a much happier book than \\"Typee\\", there are a few scenes that preview Melville's later narrative power.  Here is the \\"Julia\\" in a tropical Pacific gale:  <br /> <br />\\"Under such a press of canvas, and with the heavy sea running, the barque, diving her bows under, now and then shipped green glassy waves, which, breaking over the head-rails, fairly deluged that part of the the ship, and washed clear aft.\\" <br /> <br />And here is a glimpse of the brooding quality of his later work: <br /> <br />\\"But my meditations were soon interrupted by a gray, spectral shadow cast over the heaving billows.  It was the dawn, soon followed by the first rays of the morning.  They flashed into view at one end of the arched night, like - to compare great things with small - the gleamings of Guy Fawkes's lantern in the vaults of the Parliament House.  Before long, what seemed a live ember rested for a moment on the rim of the ocean, and at last the blood-red sun stood full and round in the level East, and the  long sea-day began.\\" <br /> <br />But these are very isolated examples.  By and large, \\"Omoo\\" is a great contrast with Melville's other books.  It is a light, easy, and amusing read.  Highly recommended for Melville fans.  <br /> <br />Helpful critical works on Melville: <br /> <br />Newton Arvin - \\"Herman Melville\\" <br />D.H. Lawrence -\\"Studies in Classic American Literature\\". <br />F.O. Matthiessen - \\"American Renaissance\\" <br /> <br />Note:  This particular edition is from the Northwestern-Newberry Edition of Melville's works, and is an MLA Approved Text.  As such, it is authoritative, but it lacks an explanatory introduction, which may be a slight drawback.	2005-06-09
US	47014068	R114BIBMLZJN6X	0883557185	970148914	Socrates	Books	5	15	15	N	N	Saving Athens' soul in spite of itself.	Alfred Edward Taylor was the son of a Methodist minister, who was educated at Oxford and taught moral philosophy.  He spent his last years teaching at Edinburgh, where he died in 1945.  He was a leading authority on Plato.      This brief popular study of Socrates was first published in Britain in 1933.  It is divided into four sections.    In the first section, on Socrates' early life, Taylor creates a very full picture of Socrates in his younger years, much more specific than most modern experts believe is justified.  But he marshals the circumstantial evidence supporting his case well, and it is interesting to read.    In the next section, covering Socrates' trial and death, Taylor does a good job of elucidating the political and legal issues of the trial.  He thinks that Socrates' accusers truly believed that Socrates was a threat to the Athenian state, and were not acting merely out of personal spite, although they probably intended to force Socrates into exile rather than execute him.  He believes the jury was taken by surprise by Socrates' refusal to go peacefully, that he forced the issue in a direction they did not anticipate, and finally succeeded in angering enough of them that a majority condemned him to death.  Even then, the door was left open for exile via a secret escape from prison, which any normal person would have taken.  They had not anticipated how unlike most men Socrates was.    In the final section, Taylor elaborates on Socrates' thinking, attributing to him ideas, such as the doctrine of the Forms and his conception of the Soul, that modern authorities would consider Plato's.        Taylor presents a point of view of the study of Plato (and of Plato's teacher, Socrates) that was once widely held.  The Ancient Graeco-Roman world comes down to us only in fragile and very incomplete form, so that in some ways it acts as a sort of \\"cultural Rorschach test\\", by which the values of the interpretor and his times are projected back onto the Classical world, with results that are often impossible either to fully verify or completely disprove.    Many thinkers have shared Taylor's vision of Socrates as a spiritual figure, a sort of pagan Jesus Christ, and there is no doubt that the Western intellectual tradition begins with Socrates.  This alone makes Taylor's book well worth reading.	2005-05-31

His experience teaching high-level undergraduates shows in this book, which is very accessible to the educated non-specialist who wants to know why Socrates is so important.<br /><br />The book is organized chronologically, following the events of the trial as they are presented to us in the dialogues of Plato.  The style is clear and concise.  There are copious footnotes, 670 of them in 227 pages, but they are all pertinent and they do not interfere significantly with the narrative flow.  There is an extensive bibliography, almost as valuable as the narrative itself, for those interested in pursuing further study of Socrates.<br /><br />Prof. Colaiaco deeply admires Socrates, holds him up as the first example of principled opposition by the individual to arbitrary state power.  He is disappointed by Socrates' provocation of the jury into sentencing him to death, and in Socrates' refusal to accept exile as an alternative.  Yet Colaiaco shows that the outcome was inevitable, given the desperate political situation of Athens at the time, and Socrates' stubborn lifelong mission to save the souls of his fellow citizens.<br /><br />Colaiaco notes that the jury was obligated to make a decision that was in the best interest of the Athenian polis, not in the best interest of justice.  This illustrates just how different Athenian legal and political ideas were from our own, even though Athens was a democracy.  Under the Athenian legal system, the law was whatever the Athenian jury, chosen by lot, said it was on the day it rendered its verdict, and there was no appeal.  Our concept of justice as \\"equality before the law\\" did not come into existence until some generations later, and then not in Athens, but in Rome.<br /><br />I was disappointed that Prof. Colaiaco didn't comment on Socrates' last words, telling Crito to sacrifice a cock to Aesclepius.  Socrates was no doubt being ironic, as always, but what did he mean?  That his soul had been healed?

The term \\"Classics\\" refers to the study of Greek and Latin Antiquity, but the authors seem to be vaguely embarrassed and apologetic in a \\"P.C.\\" kind of way for their interest in this field.  If they had deleted Chapter 3, which is a disclaimer of any belief in the \\"superiority\\" of the Classical tradition, and if they had avoided sticking the word \\"classics\\" in italics at odd places throughout the text, as though we might have forgotten what the book was about, I would have enjoyed it more.      Having said that, they cover an awful lot of ground in surprising depth and in an interesting way in a short few pages.  The discussion is organized around the Temple of Bassae, about which they tell us a great deal, using the temple and its history to explain the very complicated relationship between the culture of Ancient Greece and Rome and our own.  I have a good though unsystematic familiarity with the Classical world, and I found much that was new and interesting in this book.      The list of further reading is very good, in spite of being a bit \\"P.C.\\"  It is perhaps geared more to the intermediate student than to the complete beginner.  The further one delves into the Classical world, the more one realizes just how vast an ocean one has entered, so even this list just scratches the surface.    It's a good read, but I took one star off for unwarranted political correctness.    As an introduction to the Classical world for beginners Edith Hamilton's \\"The Greek Way\\" and \\"The Roman Way\\" are hard to beat.  They were written in pre-\\"P.C.\\" days, when one didn't have to be coy about extolling the virtues of Western culture and the Classical tradition.    Moses I. Finley's \\"The Ancient Greeks\\", though less lyrical than Hamilton's books, is also quite good.	2005-05-15

This is an unusually good, short, very readable history of a difficult and contentious event, to which justice has not previously been done.  I have read the usual accounts in the general histories (Churchill, Liddell Hart, Keegan and others) of the Second World War, as well as Shirer's \\"The Collapse of the Third Republic: An Inquiry into the Fall of France in 1940\\", and none of them compare with Jackson's book.  He has a very clear and precise writing style and tells the story in a well-organized manner.  His citations of French, British, and German sources are very complete and to the point.  His conclusions and the evidence he bases them on are very clear, leaving one free to agree or disagree as one wishes.  He seems to have no agenda other than the desire to fulfill the historian's first obligation, which is to tell us WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.  He also gives a rather complete discussion, for such a short book, of previous accounts and interpretations of The Fall of France.    After carefully considering the various previous explanations that have been put forth, he in the end attributes the French defeat primarily to a miscalculation by the French High Command as to where the Germans would attack, namely through the Ardennes Forest.  It should be noted that the Allied High Command - Eisenhower, Bradley, Montgomery - made the same mistake only four years later, in November, 1944.  They also assumed that the Germans could not mount an armored attack through that same Ardennes Forest, with near disastrous results for the Allies.  Such an attack had been predicted as early as 1933 by B.H. Liddell Hart.  His warnings of course were ignored in both 1940 and 1944.     Even so, the key factor in the German victory, which surprised the Germans themselves, seems to have been the speed of the German attack.  Guderian in fact was ordered to slow down and even halt after crossing the Meuse because the German High Command feared a French flanking attack from the south.  Guderian offered his resignation to Kleist, who relented, and so the attack went on.  The French in fact did finally attack the German flank, but too slowly and too late.  They were just not prepared for the speed with which aggressive armored operations could be conducted.  Jackson demonstrates clearly that the margin of German victory over France was much closer than it later seemed in retrospect, after the collapse of French morale and the ascendency of Vichy.      Jackson's analysis of the long-term political effects of 1940 on the subsequent course of events of the twentieth century in France, Europe, and the world is quite illuminating, one of the best sections of the book.  He uses the quite different responses to 1940 of two men, Charles de Gaulle and Francois Mitterand, very effectively to illustrate his points.    The story of the Fall of France demonstrates, I believe, one unfortunate disadvantage of consensual, democratic government as opposed to tyranny, and that is that democracies are slow to mobilize for war and reluctant to throw the first punch.  This gives the single-minded aggressor the opportunity to make that first punch a knock-out blow, which is what seems to have happened to France in 1940, from which France may not yet have fully recovered.    Related reading:    B.H. Liddell Hart - \\"History of the Second World War\\"  (L.H. says         \\"I told you so\\" repeatedly.)

Alan Booth followed in the steps (pun intended) of numerous previous travel writers, and was better than most.  He had a ready wit and an excellent sense of humor, and bore the hardships of his chosen method of travel well.  He also liked to drink, an asset when traveling on foot in Japan.    He describes three different walks, each with a distinctive theme.  The first follows the trail of Japanese novelist Osamu Dazai's 1944 tour of his home region, Tsugaru, in Northern Honshu.  The second follows the path of General Takamori Saigo's retreat from the Battle of Enodake, in Kyushu, which ended the Satsuma rebellion in 1877.  The third follows the possible track over central Honshu of the remnents of the Heike clan after their defeat at the Battle of Dannoura in 1186.    Along the way, between descriptions of his blisters and complaints about the weather, he weaves bits of history in with reflections on literature and drama, Japanese society, his own life, and the merits of various alcoholic beverages.  He enjoys the Japanese, but doesn't necessarily like them, pokes fun at them constantly.  Not that the Japanese, like any other nationality, don't deserve having fun poked at them.  But one sometimes wonders why Booth spent so many years living in a country and learning the language of a people for whom he seems to have had so little respect.  He acknowledges this indirectly even in the title of the book, \\"Looking for the Lost\\", which implies that he is looking for a Japan that may never have existed.      His comments on the Noh are interesting, but perplexing.  He was a trained actor, went to Japan to learn about the Noh, and became disillusioned with it very quickly.  From the little I have read and seen of Noh drama, it is based on quite different assumptions from European, especially Shakespearean, drama.  It was \\"pickled\\" from the very beginning, an esoteric art form invented for the nobility, nothing \\"popular\\" or \\"alive\\" about it.  Booth seems to have taken thatdifference personally, as if the Japanese had played a trick on him, rather than seeing the Noh for the quite unusual dramatic form that it is.    His announcement at the end of the book that he has colon cancer is terse and matter of fact, in some ways like Dazai's attitude toward suicide.  One thinks of him writing this book with death looking over his shoulder, which perhaps explains the bittersweet feeling one gets while reading it.    Related works:    Basho - \\"The Narrow Road to the Deep North\\"  Isabella Bird - \\"Unbeatan Tracks in Japan\\"  Ezra Pound and Ernest Fenellosa - \\"The Classic Noh Theatre of             Japan\\"  Mishima Yukio - \\"Five Modern Noh Plays\\"    These are not nearly as much fun to read as Alan Booth.

It is written in a straightforward narrative manner, but it is a work of fiction, NOT a journalistic report, something that is often overlooked.  While, like \\"Moby Dick\\", it contains lots of factual details, mostly quite accurate as confirmed by subsequent research, it is a much more complex tale than it appears to be on the surface. <br /> <br />For a first novel, written when Melville was only 27 years old, the narrative power is quite impressive, as for example in his description of the escape from the ship over the mountains to the Valley of the Typee.  In the early chapters, themes of peace, beauty, and sensuality are combined with Melville's righteous indignation at the activities of Western military and religious intruders to create the illusion of an earthly paradise.  Gradually dread, loneliness, horror, and fear of annihilation come to the fore, as \\"Tommo\\", the protagonist, becomes convinced that he is being kept for eventual eating at a ritual cannibal feast.  He is finally rescued almost by chance, and because of conflict among the Typees. <br /> <br />I read the Oxford World's Classics paperback edition, which has an introduction by Ruth Blair, an Australian professor of English.  It was very helpful with Melville's historical and literary sources and the geographical and cultural context.  The chapter on \\"Typee\\" in \\"Studies in Classic American Literature\\" by D.H. Lawrence adds a further depth of understanding.  Newton Arvin's biography of Melville helps to place \\"Typee\\" in the development of Melville as a writer. <br /> <br />Highly recommended in its own right as a superb example of 19th century American romanticism, with hints of the impending metaphysical explosion of \\"Moby Dick\\".	2005-05-03

There is a \\"hand-wringing\\" quality to his writing, as though he were afraid of offending someone, perhaps due to its being written for the BBC.  And he fudges in a big way British pre-war bungling regarding the Rhineland and Czechoslovakia, and Stalin's role in the purge trials.      Part of the explanation for the whitewash of Stalin can be found in the publications dates:  The first edition of this book was published in 1989, so it was written BEFORE the fall of the Soviet Union, whereas the second edition came out in 1999, afterward.  I don't have a copy of the first edition for comparison purposes, but I do have Overy's \\"Russia's War\\", which came out in 1997, in which he is very clear about Stalin's direct role in the purge trials.  It appears that Overy didn't go to the trouble of revising this material for the second edition \\"The Road to War\\", perhaps thought \\"Russia's War\\" was enough.  But he could at least have made reference to his newer work, rather than let his older misinformation stand uncorrected.    Overy obfuscates the British role in Hitler's remilitarization of the Rhineland in 1936 and in selling out the Czechs at the Munich debacle in 1938, but I'm not sure why he thinks he can get away with this.  The historical record of British indifference and French trepidation is quite clear in both instances.        He goes on for pages about FDR's problems with the Isolationists, but never once mentions Harold Nicolson's now well-known 1939-41 secret U.S.-based propaganda campaign against American neutrality.     Andrew Wheatcroft's chapter on Japan is pretty good.    Overy is a good writer, which can lead one to believe that one is learning a great deal while reading his books.  But at least in this book Overy neglects the first task of the historian, which is to tell us WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.  Atmosphere is nice, but the facts have priority.    Suggestions for further (and better) reading:    Winston Churchill - \\"The Second World War\\", volume 1.   Basil Liddell Hart - \\"History of World War Two\\"  Julian Jackson - \\"The Fall of France\\"  Richard Overy - \\"Russia's War\\" - based on post-1989 evidence, this is much better than the chapter on Russia in \\"The Road to War\\".      Not recommended.	2005-04-30

Clausewitz is notoriously difficult to understand, according to Prof. Howard, because so much of what he wrote was not intended for publication.  As Clausewitz himself stated, he wrote a \\"collection of materials from which a theory of war was to have been distilled.\\"  Professor Howard, the co-author of the standard English translation of Clausewitz, begins that distillation process in these few pages.    He first places Clausewitz in context, with a review of his family origins and military experience.  He was commissioned as an officer in the Prussian Army at the age of 12, fought in his first campaign in 1793 at the age of 13 against the forces of Revolutionary France on the Rhine and then in the Vosges.  In 1806 he was captured following the French defeat of Prussian forces at Auerstadt, a subsidiary of Napoleon's great victory over the Prussians at Jena.  He then spent two years in captivity as a prisoner of war in France.  When later the Prussian king allied himself with Napoleon, Clausewitz resigned from the Prussian Army and joined the Russian Army, where he participated in the Russian victory over Napoleon at Borodino.  When the Prussian King, Frederick William III, eventually joined the Alliance against Napoleon in 1813, Clausewitz became an advisor to General Blucher during the Leipzig campaign, though still in Russian uniform.  After being allowed by the King to rejoin the Prussian Army he became chief of staff to the Prussian III Corps, which acted as a blocking force at Waterloo.  He then spent 12 years at the Prussian Army War College, where he spent much of his time writing his most famous work, On War.  He died in 1831, at the age of 51, in a cholera epidemic in Breslau, where he had been sent to institute a cordon sanitaire to prevent the disease from spreading.      Clausewitz' ideas were formed in the cauldron of the transition from formalized 18th century warfare to the total war of the French Revolution and Napoleonic era.  The successive Prussian defeats had a profound effect on him, stimulating a rethinking of the theory of warfare as it evolved in his lifetime.  There is much debate about how much of his work applies only to the particular circumstances of his era and how much is applicable to warfare in general.      He is frequently contradictory and ambiguous, which is not surprising, given the extreme complexity of the human social phenomenon he is attempting to analyze.  These are a few of his better-known concepts:         - the FRICTION of war (now often called the \\"FOG of war\\")       - successful warfare always involves a FIGHT, although paradoxically, an \\"unfought fight\\", such as the nuclear exchange that didn't happen during the Cold War, can have as much effect as an actual fight       - the necessity of attacking the enemy's CENTER         - the power of the DEFENSE        - the necessity of SUPERIOR FORCE for VICTORY       - the importance of MORALE       - the concept of WAR AS AN EXTENSION OF POLITICS        Prof. Howard provides a good summary of the way Clausewitz influenced the ideas and operations of the great wars of the 20th century - WWI, WWII, and the Cold War - and gives guidance for further study.  He recommends in particular three books:    Peter Paret - \\"Clausewitz and the State\\"  Azar Gat - \\"The Origins of Military Thought from the       Enlightenment to Clausewitz\\"  Raymond Aron - \\"Penser la guerre, Clausewitz\\"    There is as yet no complete English translation of Clausewitz' works.    Highly recommended as an introduction to the study of history's foremost philosopher of warfare.	2005-04-27

My copy of this book was published in 1993, but the 1999 edition available on Amazon appears to be the same book, a reissue, not a revision.    Prof. Cashman has performed the heroic task of creating a textbook accessible to undergraduates on a subject that continues to perplex the Henry Kissingers and Robert McNamaras of the world.  He is honest enough to say in his summary chapter that he does not know the answer to the question he poses, nor does anyone else.  In the process of coming to that conclusion, he provides an excellent survey of the various theoretical approaches to the problem of the causation of war, an accomplishment for which he gets 5 stars.    However, I have some significant criticisms of this book, which seems to be a standard text for undergraduate courses on warfare.  My concerns are Prof. Cashman's tendency toward simplistic thinking and, for want of a better term, his \\"liberal\\" bias.  By \\"liberal\\", I mean a belief that human beings are basically good natured creatures who will behave nicely if left unmolested by politicians and capitalist expoiters.  This is the view espoused by Rousseau and by those thinkers on the Left who have followed in Rousseau's footsteps.      His belief that \\"the central imperative of our times is therefore to avoid wars of mass destruction; all other goals suffer in comparison\\" is not espoused by several other nation-states with which we share Planet Earth, not to mention the practitioners of terror.  This leaves him in the end unprepared to follow the logic of his own research and study:  If \\"one theme of this book is that if we can understand the causes of war, we should be better able to prevent their occurance\\", then Prof. Cashman should be able to come up with a better ending to his book than an exhortion to  national leaders to \\"Do the right thing.\\"  Winston Churchill would no doubt have appreciated that insight during The Battle of Britain, but he might have wanted a little more detail as to how to determinejust exactly what IS the \\"right thing\\".  But Prof. Cashman admits that he can't tell us, so why does he get our hopes up in the first place?    Another concern is that Prof. Cashman frequently engages in evasive rhetorical tactics by grossly mischaracterizing the position of those with whom he disagrees.  For example, he states:      \\"Those who believe that the fundamental cause of war is that humans are naturally aggressive take the position that all men (and women) are the same.\\"      This is a caricature of the argument he opposes, not a fair statement of it, as would be obvious to anyone who has read Thucydides, Machiavelli, Calvin, Hobbes, Freud, and the framers of the American Constitution, not to mention numerous modern philosophers and historians and of course the sociobiologists.  By resorting to such a caricature he undercuts the validity of his criticism and gravely weakens his overall argument.    I was motivated to write this review by the thought that Prof. Cashman has the question wrong.  It's obvious to all but the most extreme believer in the \\"tabula rasa\\" that war is caused by human misbehavior of great variety and ingenuity.  The real question is:  What causes peace?  And are we capable of finding a better answer than that of the Roman Vegetius:  \\"Si vis pacem, para bellum\\":  \\"If you would have peace, prepare for war\\"?    So far, the realistic answer is \\"No\\".      Should we continue to look for a better answer?  Yes, but not at the price of making ourselves vulnerable to attack.      As a wise person once said, \\"The only thing worse than a war won is a war lost.\\"	2005-04-26

With over 200 Amazon reviews, and much critical material available on the web (see [...] for example) it is difficult to say something about Murakami that hasn't been better said elsewhere. <br /> <br />The Wind-up Bird Chronicle, like all Murakami's books,  is very absorbing, flows like a long, complicated dream, a good mystery or science fiction novel.  The fact that the world inhabited by Murakami's characters is, like the characters themselves, somewhat peculiar adds to the interest.  <br /> <br />The World War Two scenes are very vivid, almost cinematic.  Murakami himself says they are fictitious and imaginative, but based on research. <br /> <br />The plot, while intriguing, doesn't make much sense and isn't resolved very well.  The fact that the English translation leaves out large chunks of the Japanese original may account for part of the problem, but plot, so far as I can tell, is not a big issue for Japanese writers in general.  And Murakami, in spite of his familiarity with and use of Western culture, is very Japanese.   <br /> <br />Highly recommended for anyone interested in great modern literature.	2005-04-23

Captain Basil Liddell Hart was the most famous military historian of the 20th century.  Everything he wrote is worth reading, and this is one of his best.      His style is clear, direct, and easy to read.  He leaves you in no doubt as to what he thinks.  He loves to say \\"I told you so\\", and was in a better position than most to exercise that unbecoming character trait.  I don't know of any other historian who can say, as L.H. does:     \\"When in November, 1933, I was consulted as to how our fast tank formations - which the War Office was just beginning to form - could best be used in a future war I had suggested that, in the event of a German invasion of France, we should deliver a tank counterattack through the Ardennes.  I was thereupon told that 'the Ardennes were impassible to tanks', to which I replied that, from personal study of the terrain, I regarded such a view as a delusion - as I had emphasized in several books between the wars.\\"      Guderian's tank attack through the Ardennes in 1940 and the German Ardennes tank offensive of 1944 fully justify L.H.'s right to say \\"I told you so.\\"    This is a straightforward chronological history of the military operations of the major belligerent powers of the Second World War, so much is left out that appears in more general histories.  Also, it was written before the  \\"Ultra\\" and other secret operations were declassified, which is a drawback.  However, current thinking is shifting on the subject of just how much these operations actually contributed to Allied victory (see John Keegan's recent \\"Intelligence in War\\", for example), so that his commentary on the strategic and tactical mistakes of the various combatants is still very much worth reading.  His \\"Epilogue\\", though controversial, is a brilliant and valuable summation of the overall course of the war.    He ends the book on a pessimistic note, clearly very disappointed that a war fought to defend Eastern Europe from a totalitarian power ended with a similar power in occupation of those countries:    \\"Thus the train of European civilization rolled into the long, dark tunnel from which it only emerged after six exhausting years had passed.  Even then, the bright sunlight of victory proved illusory.\\"    If we accept L.H.'s analysis, the Second World War didn't really end until 1989, with the demise of the USSR and the end of its long occupation of Eastern Europe.    Any student of politics, history or warfare, and anyone interested in how our world came to be the way it is, should be familiar with the writings of Basil Liddell Hart, including this book.       Highly recommended.	2005-04-23

Some readers may be tempted to view this as a book of humor, intended to \\"lighten up\\" the often ponderous tendency of American practictioners of Eastern religions to take themselves too seriously.

This short little book gives the impression of having been written by a lazy professor who wanted to pick up a few quid on the side, so he spent a couple of weekends adding some verbal fluffery to his already-potted lecture notes, and OUP let him get away with it. <br /> <br />How do I know he's lazy?  Because he never explains anything.  Here's how he puts it in the introduction:   <br /> <br />\\"It is true that you will need the determination to master some symbolism that may be new to you;  but this is a lot less than is required to have a basic grasp of any new language.  And the perspicuity that the symbolism gives to difficult questions makes any trouble one may have in mastering it well worth it.\\"   <br /> <br />So in the second chapter he jumps into truth tables and begins to use symbolic logic to explain his arguments, and does so all the way through the rest of the book.  Each of the chapters ends with its main idea given in symbolic notation, which I found very irritating and not at all helpful.  He may as well have said, \\"Here are some Japanese ideograms for you to look at.  If you're really smart, and stare at them long enough, they will begin to make sense to you.  Tah, tah!\\" <br /> <br />By the way, \\"perspicuous\\", one of Prof. Priest's favorite words (another is \\"tendentious\\"), means \\"clear\\" or \\"lucid\\", neither of which applies to this book.  But that is the book's second big problem:  Prof. Priest's style.  His chunks of symbolic logic are broken up by \\"chatty\\", breezy \\"discussions\\" that reminded me of Abbott and Costello routines.  Here is an example:   <br /> <br />\\"Consider the liar paradox and its cousin.  Take the latter first.  The sentence 'This sentence is true' was supposed to be an example of something that is neither true nor false.  Let us suppose that this is so.  Then, in particular, it is not true.  But it, itself, says that it is true.  So it must be false, contrary to our supposition that it is neither true nor false.  We seem to haveended up in a contradiction.\\"   <br /> <br />And Who, exactly, was it that was on first, anyway?  And why are we hearing about the Liar's Paradox in a Very Brief Introduction to Logic, unless it's just Prof. Priest showing off again?  I'm sure he would be a real annoyance to have to sit next to on a long airplane ride. <br /> <br />The third big problem with this book is its organization.  The last chapter, on the history of logic, should logically come first.  Right?  So we know where we're going.  And if logic is really hard-wired into us, then the book should be organized logically, with the easy stuff first, and the hard stuff, like logical symbols, later.  Right?  But that takes time, and thought, and, well, WORK, and Prof. Priest wasn't up for WORK,  at least on this book. <br /> <br />I don't know what the discussion of \\"possible worlds\\" is doing in a book on logic, except that Prof. Priest wants to show off again, rather than to teach.  And why all the talk about God?  Does Prof. Priest have a thing about God, as another reviewer suggests?  This is a Very Short Introduction, not a book on the philosophy of religion, so there isn't much room, and what room there is should go to discuss LOGIC, NOT theology. <br /> <br />In short, OUP should find someone to rewrite this book so that it really IS a Very Short Introduction to Logic, rather than a mish-mash of symbols, philosophy of religion, cutesy discussions of paradoxes, and a tendentious lack of perspicuity. <br /> <br />Not recommended.	2005-04-17
US	47014068	RN7EHSXI4M0E7	0521483476	467358055	Paradoxes	Books	5	7	10	N	Y	Excellent book, but not for the beginner.	As a beginner in the study of philosophy, I have frequently read that the study of paradoxes is a waste of time, that paradoxes add little to the appreciation of philosophy as a whole.  Perhaps that's true.  Prof. Sainsbury in his introduction even warns us that the study of paradoxes is said to have led to the premature death of Philetas of Cos back in the old days. <br /> <br />I made the mistake of thinking that as a beginning student of philosophy I would be capable of fully appreciating this book and absorbing its contents.  In fact, I am not, and could not.  However, I can say without hesitation that it wasn't Professor Sainsbury's fault.  He writes very clearly and without affectation, presenting the material as well as anyone could.  Perhaps he makes some errors in his analysis of the paradoxes, but others will have to judge that, not I. <br /> <br />In addition to the \\"fun\\" of paradoxes, he also relates them to more general problems of philosophy, which I was better able to absorb.  For example, in discussing Newcomb's paradox and rational behavior, he has this to say: <br /> <br />\\"A clear perception of the advantages of being a one-boxer cannot give you a REASON for becoming one - even if that were in your power.  Atheists might clearly perceive the comfort to be derived from theism, but this does not give them a REASON for believing that God exists.  The light of reason cannot direct one toward what one perceives as irrational.  To adopt a position one regards as irrational one needs to rely on something other than reason:  drugs, fasting, chanting, dancing, or whatever.\\" <br /> <br />This is one of the better and more succinct descriptions of the relationship between reason and religious belief that I have read, even though I don't completely agree with it.  Reason can take one part-way toward a belief in God, even if total belief is ultimately irrational.  But at least one understands what Prof. Sainsbury has to say on the subject, and it's a minor point, anyway. <br /> <br />Highly recommended, for those who can handle it.	2005-04-17

A \\"Google\\" search of Professor Ruby reveals that he taught at Roosevelt College (now Roosevelt University) in Chicago, and that his textbook is well thought of by Objectivists.  It is written for college students with no previous exposure to logic or philosophical argument.  The  major subject matter of the book is what is now called \\"formal\\" or \\"Aristotelian\\" logic.  There are three sections, the first on use of language, the second on deductive reasoning, including an introductory chapter on symbolic logic, and the third on scientific method and inductive reasoning.    He writes very clearly, defines his terms carefully, and builds his ideas in slow, steady progression.  There are numerous examples and problems.  References are given on specific issues in the problem sections.    Because it was last revised in 1960, the language and examples are of that pre-VietNam, pre-political-correctness era.  For some this may be a detraction, but I found it refreshing.  Although he uses many examples from the current events of the time, he manages successfully to keep his personal political views to himself, and does not advance a political agenda.  Feminists will no doubt be offended by the way he uses Schopenhauer's \\"Essay on Women\\" in his discussion of the \\"ad hominem\\" argument.  But even Chesterton found Schopenhauer's essay offensive.    A more representative example of his approach is this, in his discussion in an early chapter of verbal (as opposed to actual) agreements:    \\"For example, the United States, Great Britain, and the U.S.S.R. agreed at the Yalta and Potsdam 'summit' conferences that democratic governments would be established through free elections in Poland and elsewhere.  The words 'democracy' and 'free' were not precisely defined, and it soon became apparent that the parties had entirely different notions as to what the words meant.  They were in fundamental disagreement concerning policy, but their disagreement was concealed by their acceptance of words which they interpreted differently.\\"      With our knowledge now of what actually went on at Yalta and Potsdam, this is of course a highly simplistic description of events, but it illustrates his point about basic definitions using a topic of the day in a reasonably neutral manner.    The chapters that were most helpful to me were those on verbal disputes, on definitions, and on logical evasions.  I read this book during the 2004 political campaign, which provided daily examples of all three topics.  The section on scientific method is the clearest discussion I have ever come across of the subject, one that anyone contemplating a scientific career should read.    There are numerous introductory books on logic available.  Those  I have attempted to read have made the subject seem obscure and confusing.  I found Prof. Ruby's textbook to be clear, straightforward, and easy to assimilate, and I highly recommend it.	2005-04-11
US	47014068	R3HSEJCZ9L7KE7	019280216X	125535474	Plato: A Very Short Introduction	Books	2	90	124	N	Y	Short and deficient.	This is Prof. Annas' second contribution to this series, her first being A Short Introduction to Ancient Philosophy.  This one does not measure up to the first.  Some of the weaknesses of \\"Ancient Philosophy\\" are more evident in \\"Plato\\", while the strengths are lacking.<br /><br />My first beef with Prof. Annas is trivial, but annoying, and that is her insistance that the traditional English language usage for the third person impersonal discriminates against females.  In order to counter this supposed disrespect of females, she creates opportunities to plunk down a \\"she\\" or a \\"her\\" where a \\"one\\" or \\"it\\" or \\"he\\" would normally be expected.  An example:  Annas writes, \\"Someone who wins the lottery, for example, may well not be made any happier by just having the money.  Unless she puts it to intelligent use, the money may do nothing for her, or even ruin her life.\\"  So, we were talking about the relationship of money to happiness, when suddenly the topic changes to gender politics.  Why not just say, \\"Unless the money is put to intelligent use, it may contribute nothing to happiness, and may even ruin one's life\\", and leave gender politics out of it?  I purchased this book in order to learn about Plato, not to deal with Julia Annas' feminist complexes.<br /><br />She is excessively agnostic about the order of composition of the Platonic dialogues, dismisses with little discussion the internal evidence for a sequence, and its implications for the reconstruction of a picture of the historic Socrates.  My complaint is not that she disagrees, but that she doesn't discuss the issue, which seems to be an important one in studies of Plato.  And she really doesn't get to the meat of Socrates' irony and method of inquiry.<br /><br />She devotes an entire chapter to sex and gender issues, only to then dismiss Plato thus:  \\"By this point, studying Plato has little to contribute to modern feminist discussion:  his starting points and many of his assumptions are too remote from ours for him to be a profitable partner in debate for very long.\\"  If that's true, why did we just spend an entire chapter, 14 percent of a very short book, on the subject?<br /><br />The remainder of the book is taken up with superficial discussions of Plato's views of virtue, the soul, and metaphysics, and ends with a rousing statement of the obvious:  \\"For in the end, his deepest message is not that we should believe in Forms, or the importance of virtue, but that we should engage with him, and with our own contemporaries, in aspiring to understand these matters.\\"<br /><br />I finished her Short Introduction to Ancient Philosophy stimulated to read more.  By contrast, reading this book left me with the opposite feeling, that reading more by Annas would be frustrating and a waste of time.	2005-03-28
US	47014068	ROP0UYME8EWHZ	0865971900	332070847	Story of Law, The	Books	5	16	16	N	N	Law for citizens of a commercial republic.	This is one of the series of high quality, low cost reprints of legal and historical classics published by The Liberty Press.  It was originally published in 1927, and first reprinted by Liberty in 1992.  Zane was a successful commercial attorney who also had a strong interest in the history of the law.  This book was an ambitious undertaking, an outline of the development of the Western legal tradition from prehistoric to modern times.  It is no doubt regarded as being hopelessly out of date by modern legal scholars, but I haven't seen anything better or more recent for the general reader.      Zane's style is for the most part simple and straightforward, understandable by the reader of average education and literacy.  At the time he wrote this book, in the mid-1920's, prosperity had come for the first time to millions of Americans, and television had not yet been invented.  Reading was a major middle-class activity, the Book of the Month Club and Readers Digest were becoming household names, and Zane's book was aimed at that newly educated audience.      Zane has a couple of hobby-horses, one being that commercial law is the foundation of civilization, and he tends to ride it a bit excessively.  He may be correct in his opinion, given that commerce is the foundation of the prosperity and dominance of our modern \\"Western\\" civilization, but his own professional bias is also clearly at work.  He was also fascinated by the development of the English court system and legal profession.  His description of those institutions in the Late Middle Ages is a bit tedious, with more detail than the average general reader is likely to find interesting.  He is very opinionated, which I find entertaining, but this may not be to everyone's taste.     He believed that law evolved organically out of the fact that human beings were creatures who lived in groups and therefore needed to regulate their behavior towards each other in order to survive and reproduce.  Law, for Zane, is a human creation, deeply based on custom and biology, not on divine will or the theories of judges.  His very informative discussion of the origins of the concept of \\"natural law\\" illustrates this belief.      He has little good to say about the laws of the ancient Greeks, attributes most of what we now call law, including the English Common Law, to the Romans.  He also has little regard for the Anglo-Saxons, or Justice Coke, or the jury system.  His chapter on the development of the American legal system is titled \\"The Absolute Reign of Law\\", which states his view of the case very clearly.  He spends much time in this chapter discussing the impeachment of Justice Samuel Chase in 1804, which he believes permanently set the shape of the American political system.  (It should be noted that Justice Rehnquist wrote a history of the Chase impeachment in 1992.)    His chapter on international law includes a long discussion of the Alabama Claims tribunal.  He had a jaundiced view of the American attitude toward that tribunal, and would no doubt be unsurprised by the attitude of the current American government toward international law.    Zane's book is a solid introduction to the history of the Western legal system, and provides a good foundation for further study by the non-professional.  Highly recommended.	2005-03-27
US	47014068	RSN0E1SCOM16N	0385260326	287129497	The Trial of Socrates	Books	2	30	51	N	N	A modern sophist takes on an ancient philosopher.	On its own merits, Stone's book deserves only one star, but because it has brought Socrates to the attention of a wider audience than he otherwise would have it gets a second star.    Maybe Stone learned Attic Greek in order to write this book, and maybe he didn't.  Nothing Stone wrote in this book required analysis of primary sources or any depth of knowledge of Attic Greek, in contrast with the truly scholarly work on Socrates, which often turns on the evaluation of subtle stylistic and linguistic evidence in the ancient sources.    Stone's methods are those of the advocate, the special pleader, and the polemicist, which of course is what he was for his entire journalistic career. He was clearly not a scholar, in spite of his pretensions.  He would have fit in quite well with the clever Sophists Socrates had so much fun arguing against, and so little respect for.  Perhaps Stone had a grudge against Socrates because  Socrates would never have taken Stone seriously had the two ever  met.  Socrates would no doubt have taken Stone apart just like he did everyone else he encounters in Plato's Dialogues.    The idea that Socrates could have used a \\"free speech\\" defense at his trial in ancient Athens is preposterous.  The Athenian democracy quite frequently fined, exiled, or put to death its citizens for the flimsiest of reasons.  One has only to read Thucydides to learn this.  There was no First Amendment in  ancient Athens.  Athenian law was whatever a jury said it was on any given day.  It was for good reason that pure democracy as practiced by Athens developed such a bad reputation that it has never been seriously tried since.    A good antidote to Stone's screed is the paper by Gregory Vlastos called \\"The Historical Socrates and Athenian democracy\\", which appears in his book \\"Socratic Studies\\".  Vlastos also wrote a critical review of Stone's book in The New York Review of Books.  It should be noted that Vlastos identified himself as being Leftist in his personal political views, but didn't let that interfere with his scholarship.  And I doubt that he ever let KGB agents take him out to lunch.	2005-03-22

Akira Iriye is Charles Warren Professor of American History at Harvard University, and is a noted historian of international institutions.  This 1987 book is a well organized and well edited introduction to a complicated subject, the origins of what the Japanese call The Pacific War, and which we know as WWII in Asia and the Pacific.    The book's organization is straightforwardly chronological.  His account of these years is less dramatic but easier to follow than that of John Toland in \\"The Rising Sun\\", even though Toland is a better writer than Iriye.  Iriye has the advantage of having that period as his primary subject, whereas Toland was laying the groundwork for a dramatic account of the war itself.  And Iriye takes pains to explain his conclusions in several different ways, a habit no doubt learned from teaching college undergraduate students, who are the primary target audience of this book.      Iriye clearly describes the step by step process by which Japan entrapped itself in a net from which it was in the end only able to escape by engaging in a suicidal war.  He shows how extremely naive Japanese political and military leaders were to think that they could overturn the existing order in Asia without serious consequences.  Ironically, most of them - Konoye, Tojo, Yamamoto, and others - could see the trap they were heading into, yet believed that there was no way out that would not be a disaster for Japan, and that war was the only way to preserve Japanese honor.  Contrary to some impressions, Japanese at the highest levels of leadership knew very well that Japan was no match for the United States militarily.  But things had deteriorated to the point that even the Atlantic Charter, a precursor of The United Nations, was viewed by the Japanese leadership simply as a declaration of war on Japan by the Anglo-American powers.      Iriye leaves little doubt that once Japan signed the Tripartite Pact with Hitler and Mussolini in 1938, FDR and his cabinet - Hull, Stimson, Knox, Acheson  - saw war with Japan as inevitable.  Their only goal was to try to gain time in order to avoid having to fight in both Europe and Asia at the same time.  In the event, of course, America did both.   A major irony of Japan's joining the Axis powers is that it provided none of the benefits Japan had hoped to gain from the alliance, while at the same time it ended all possibility of a rapprochement with Britain and the US.  Japan had literally backed out onto a tree limb and then proceeded to saw it off.    Iriye delineates the development of China's influence on American policy in the Far East.  By the late 1930's, China was clearly identified in the eyes of the American public as the victim of unjustified Japanese aggression.  This was indeed an accurate assessment of the situation, but the strength and emotion with which it was held by the American public gave the Roosevelt administration very little room to maneuver with Japan, even had it been inclined to do so.  Any accomodation in China that would have left Japan a way toward \\"honorable\\" retreat would have been seen by the American public, no less than Chiang Kai-Shek, as a complete betrayal of China.  This was the trap Japan had entered when the Japanese government allowed the Japanese Army to turn the incident at the Marco Polo Bridge into an excuse to invade China proper, from which there was no escape other than through total war with America.    Japanese public opinion also played a role in polarizing events.  Tojo even started contingency planning for riots should Japan decide to bow to American will and withdraw from China.  And the fear of assassination by nationalistic fanatics in the Japanese Army was an ever-present factor in the decision making of the Japanese political leadership.     Did FDR cook up a conspiracy to lure the Japanese into attacking Pearl Harbor?  Iriye thinks not, and gives pretty good reasons for his opinion, the most convincing one being that by the summer of 1941 the American political and military leadership knew from the broken Japanese diplomatic code that war with Japan was inevitable.  No conspiracy was needed to precipitate war - it was just a matter of time before the Japanese would attack.      In a nutshell, according to Iriye's analysis, Japan had three alternatives open to it by 1939:  1.  Withdraw from China and suffer the consequences:  Loss of prestige, power, resources, and military position; 2.  Follow a policy of \\"perseverance and patience\\", passively waiting for the unlikely chance that events would eventually turn in a direction more to Japan's advantage; 3.  Take the offensive immediately, while Japan still had sufficient oil reserves to support aggressive naval operations, and before the ABCD powers (America, Britain, China, and the Dutch) could further prepare themselves.  In the end, option 3 seemed the most preferable of three bad choices.     Iriye ends on an optimistic note, saying that the period from 1931-45 was an aberration in the history of Japanese-American relations.  One certainly hopes that he is right.	2005-03-16
US	47014068	R38HRXHDAUJ7EZ	0521447356	106776090	Socratic Studies	Books	5	23	24	N	N	Work of a master	This book is a companion volume to Vlastos' \\"Socrates:  Ironist and Moral Philosopher\\".  It contains five papers, on Socrates' method of inquiry (elenchus), on his disavowal of knowledge, on the \\"Socratic Fallacy\\" (also about his attitude toward knowledge), on Socrates' relationship with the Athenian government, a comparison of the \\"Protagoras\\" and the \\"Laches\\" (a very technical paper), plus an essay on Vlastos' own political attitudes compared to those of Socrates.    Vlastos assumes a knowledge of the Greek alphabet and of basic logic.  He spent his professional life trying to clarify Socrates' philosophy to the extent that it can be separated from Plato's projections.  As a non-specialist, I find Professor Vlastos' explanations very convincing, but understanding them requires time and attention to detail.  It is not light reading.    His paper on \\"Socrates and the Athenian democracy\\" covers much of the same ground as I.F. Stone's speculative and subjective book on Socrates' trial and death.  Vlastos takes pains not to outrun his evidence, and when he does, to be very clear about it.  He shows clearly that Socrates was NOT a closet oligarchist, probably sympathized with the democracy, and avoided politics when at all possible.  But he also shows that the evidence for any clear statement of Socrates' political views is sparse - \\"crumbs\\".    The essay on \\"Socrates and Vietnam\\" is the most interesting of the papers because in it Vlastos reveals his own Leftist political views and his disappointment that Socrates wasn't himself more clearly a man of the Left - in ancient terms, a man of the \\"demos\\".  He thinks this is a deficiency and that it diminishes Socrates' status as a moral example.  For Vlastos, the viciousness of Athenian politics does not excuse Socrates' passivity.    Vlastos equates the Vietnam War with the Peloponnesian War, and faults Socrates for staying silent regarding atrocities committed in that war by Athens.  While Professor Vlastos, like Socrates, is dead and can't defend himself, nevertheless it seems to me that Vlastos' naive and doctrinaire support of Communist regimes in both Vietnam and Central America was in harmony with the views of his fellow academics and much of the American electorate, and carried negligible personal risk.  Socrates, by contrast, like any Athenian citizen, ran the risk of fine, exile, or death, if he took a political position that conflicted with the \\"demos\\" of Athens.  No Athenian had the protection of a First Amendment.  Socrates' trial and execution shows the extreme vulnerability of any Athenian who came into political conflict with his fellow citizens.     Vlastos, to his credit, doesn't let his political differences with his hero interfere with his fairness and objectivity.  His work is close, careful, fair-minded, and scholarly reasoning at its best.  May his spirit reside  peacefully with that of the man he spent so many years studying.     (In fairness to Vlastos, it should be noted that in his paper \\"Socrates and Vietnam\\" he states that during the Vietnam years he was notified by the FBI that his status as an immigrant from Canada could be placed in jeopardy if he became too active in the anti-war movement.  He says that FBI notification helped keep him at his research for the next 20 years, and that he identifies with Socrates' desire to stay out of trouble with the authorities.  Vlastos, feeling more secure in exercising his First Amendment rights in the '80's, and no doubt by then a naturalized citizen, became more outspoken in his Leftist views.  However, I don't think the possibility of being deported to Canada is equivalent to being sentenced to death, and, with all due respect to the professor, I find his comparison of his own situation with that of Socrates a bit much.)	2005-03-15

Most people today, even backpackers, want more comfort than that. <br /> <br />Backpacking is usually done by people who think a lot.  It is an attempt to return to an older and simpler way of life.  It is not done out of necessity.  It is done for philosophical reasons. <br /> <br />People used to walk for long distances carrying heavy, uncomfortable loads by necessity.  Then we all got automobiles, and some of us started walking for long distances carrying heavy, uncomfortable loads for fun.  Ryel Kestenbaum's short, interesting book is about walking for long distances for fun carrying light, comfortable loads.  <br /> <br />I have Colin Fletcher's Complete Walker III in front of me.  It is 670 pages long and weighs 3lbs.  Ryel Kestenbaum's is 139 pages long and weighs just under 12oz.   <br /> <br />I love Colin Fletcher's book, started with his first, a long time ago.  But I find the ultralight approach very interesting.  Carry a light pack, and you don't need heavy shoes.  If you don't wear heavy shoes, your legs don't get so tired, so you can go farther with less fatigue.  It all fits together. <br /> <br />The gear recommendations are straightforward.  Fortunately for us, the same technology that has made life in general easier for us is making it possible for us to walk more comfortably while carrying less weight.  Kestenbaum's survey of gear, like the book, is brief, but to the point.  His most important recommendation is to minimize the gear.   <br /> <br />I was interested by his training recommendations for long-distance backpacking trips, and his rationale for them. <br /> <br />To end on a philosophical note, Thoreau said that the purpose of life is to contemplate.  I think he was cribbing from Aristotle, who said that the goal of life is to have the leisure tothink.  Thoreau practiced the ultralight philosophy before his time, and would no doubt do so today.  Aristotle would probably say make some objective observations, then judge for yourself.  The Ultralight Backpacker is a good place to start. <br /> <br />Update, July 11, 2005: <br /> <br />Attempting to follow some of Kestenbaum's recommendations, I set out to find a new pair of low-top lightweight hiking shoes/boots to replace my worn-out Vasque Skywalks.  I have wide feet, which has been a problem in the past, and it still is:  None of the available major-brand low-top hiking shoes come in wide sizes.  The local EMS had none in my size in even a regular width, let alone wide.  LL Bean's \\"Mountain Treads\\" come in wide sizes, so I ordered a pair.  The 11 1/2W, my correct foot size, was too small.  The size 12W was a better fit, but it is made on an Italian last, so the toe was too narrow and the heel too wide, so that my heel wouldn't stay seated in the shoe.  The Vasque Skywalks have served me well, so I decided to look for some new Vasque boots.  REI carries the Vasque brand, but didn't have my size in stock, either in the retail store or on-line.  I finally found a pair of Vasque Breeze GTX XCR boots in size 12 at Campmor that seem to fit well and are very comfortable.  They are hightops - no wide sizes in the Vasque lowtops.  They are lighter, more flexible, and more comfortable than the Skywalks, and the Vibram Contact outsole looks like a big improvement over the old Vibram on the Skywalks. <br /> <br />Based on my recent hike of a New Hampshire 4000 footer, I would have had to spend a lot of time knocking gravel, water, twigs, and even snow out of my shoes had I worn lowtops.  As it was, I had a fall in part due to my worn-out Skywalks, which prompted the search for new boots.  It makes me wonder what kind of trails Kestenbaum hikes on - they must be easier going than the  minimally maintained wilderness area trails in the White Mountains. <br /> <br />On that same hike I tried out a pair of North Face lightweight nylon trousers, again following Kestenbaum's suggestion, rather than my usual rugby shorts.  While the nylon pants were certainly better than the Levis I wore on a Grand Canyon hike many moons ago, they quickly became annoyingly confining around the knees as the trail steepened, and became very warm as the temperature and humidity rose.  I soon changed into the rugby shorts, and was much more comfortable.  I plan to carry the trousers with me, since they are so light, and use them if the temperature drops or bugs become overwhelming. <br /> <br />I considerably lightened my daypack before this hike - one emergency candle instead of 6, etc., - which was probably a reasonable idea.  I have also been using some of his training suggestions, which so far seem to be helpful, but I can't give a final opinion of them yet. <br /> <br />So, of Kestenbaum's suggestions that I have tried so far, two were busts, one was OK, and one is still under investigation. <br /> <br />I'm planning another hike soon, wearing my usual warm-weather garb of rugby shorts and cotton tee-shirt, and will try out my new high-top Vasque boots. <br /> <br />Update, July 21, 2005: <br /> <br />The Vasque Breeze GTX XCR's are great!  Small heel blisters on first hike, which I didn't even notice until I pulled the boots off at the end of the day.  Second hike didn't even produce those.  Very flexible, light, good traction on difficult terrain, good support, very comfortable.  No complaints whatsoever.  I like the high tops, would not feel comfortable with the lowcut equivalent, even if I could find them in a wide size.  I hike with a light daypack only.  Perhaps these would not hold up so well under a heavier pack.  Will report results in the future if that occasion arises.	2005-03-07
US	47014068	R3GF0OU38YKC1R	0385500998	489310389	The Virtues of War: A Novel of Alexander the Great	Books	5	1	1	N	N	The Virtues of Alexander	The Virtues of War is not as good a novel as Pressfield's Gates of Fire, one of the best historical novels ever written, but it is a very fine novel, well worth reading.      Of course, it is fiction with a historical basis, not history, but since even serious historians have widely differing interpretations of Alexander, Pressfield is entitled to take some liberties with the known facts, and yet retain the believability required for a novel.  He has immersed himself sufficiently in what we know of Alexander's world that his liberties are educated and not gratuitious.  Pressfield does better in this regard than Mary Renault, in my opinion.    Pressfield makes us believe that we sit with Alexander on horseback before battle, as the tension rises in both horses and men, awaiting the signal to attack the Persian line and kill King Darius.  And it may actually have been that way.  In any event, being able to generate that kind of believable illusion is the mark of a very accomplished artist.  We read fiction for that kind of experience, and Pressfield delivers.    Pressfield is honest in warning us that he tampers with the facts as they have come down to us, and that he deliberately uses anachronistic language in the service of telling his tale.  However, I had a little trouble with the idea that Alexander might have thought about \\"reordering\\" his \\"priorities\\" or use the phrase \\"order of magnitude\\", or speak of \\"options\\" being \\"closed\\", as though he were an American general at a Pentagon press conference.  I imagine Alexander \\"shifting\\" or \\"moving\\" a camp, rather than \\"reconfiguring\\" it.  Pressfield repeatedly demonstrates a flair for language that rises to Homeric intensity at times, so these lapses into American Pentagonese are a little jarring, at least to me.  But this is a minor complaint, like complaining about Babe Ruth's strike-outs.    A point of usage, perhaps the fault of an editor, rather than Pressfield, is noted on page 74:  The possessive forms of Abrutes, Thebes, and Athens are given as \\"Abrutes's\\", \\"Thebes's\\", and \\"Athens's\\".  Correct usage, according to the 1998 edition of the Oxford Dictionary of Modern American Usage, would delete the \\"s\\" after the apostrophe for the possessive form of classical names ending in \\"s\\".  Normal readers may justifiably think this is a trivial point.    Pressfield's goal in this book is to create a believable portrait of Alexander's inner life, and then to describe his accomplishments as he might have described them himself.  Even though this is a work of fiction, and even though Pressfield tampers with the facts, I believe he has come quite close to the real Alexander.  The concept of \\"daimon\\" was one familiar to Greeks of the time, Socrates' \\"daimonion\\" being one of the most well-known.  It is very credible that a pupil of Aristotle might have thought this way about the mental phenomena he was observing in himself.  The merging of one's own identity with that of one's army and one's nation is a common characteristic of charismatic leaders whose personalities we know more about:  Napoleon and Hitler come to mind.  Phillip's Macedonian Army was of course far superior to any military force that had yet been seen in the ancient world, but there is no doubt that the force and brilliance of Alexander's personality took Phillip's instrument to far greater achievements than it ever would have had under Phillip.  Lastly, Alexander's ruthlessness was not extreme by the standards of the ancient world.  His thoughts about the brutal necessities of war are quite consistent with, for example, Thucydides' Melian Dialogue, in which the vaunted Athenian democracy justifies the extermination of a neutral city, Melos, purely for \\"raisons d'etat\\" - expediency of war.    Given how little we know about Antiquity in general and Alexander in particular, it is not such a surprise that a skillful work of  imaginative writing might get us closer to the truth than would a purely objective account of the facts.  In addition, The Virtues of War is a good read, a gripping tale, very well told.	2005-03-06

I read it in anticipation of tackling his more recent and highly regarded \\"Transformation of War\\".  However, reading this one, which was published in 1989, has made me very reluctant to invest time and energy in the newer \\"Transformation\\", no matter how highly regarded it is.<br /><br />His writing style is bombastic and verbose and his train of thought diffuse.  I found myself having to constantly rewrite his sentences in my head in order to make them coherent.  Whatever original thoughts he may have, and I don't think there are many, get lost in his digressive style.<br /><br />He makes some rather curious statements for an expert on military history.  He dismisses, for example, the military utility of the oxcart, completely overlooking the very potent military application made of the oxcart by the Afrikaner Voortrekkers in the Zulu Wars, where, at the famous Battle of Blood River, circled oxcarts served admirably as a mobile fortress.  (This was of course also common practice during the same time period for immigrants on America's Oregon Trail).  He describes the stirrup as \\"not representing military technology, properly speaking\\", yet later discusses at length maps and roads as military technology.  He may be right about the stirrup, but isn't he then wrong about maps and roads?  And why make such a trivially gratuitous statement in the first place?<br /><br />At another point he casually slanders Winston Churchill (not the first to do so), describing British casualties in the last battle of the Mahdi War in the Sudan as being \\"victims of an ill-considered charge led by Winston Churchill against the wishes of the expedition's commander, General Kitchener\\".  In fact, Churchill was at the time a lowly subaltern in his early 20's, in charge of less than 25 lancers in the second troop from the rear of his cavalry regiment, and was in no position to lead a charge.  The charge was ordered by the regiment's colonel, and may have been an attempt to pre-empt a charge by the Mahdists.  In any event, this is how Churchill describes the events in \\"A Roving Commission\\".  Naturally, we don't know where van Creveld got his version of events because he has no footnotes.  He could have easily made his rather obvious point (that, technological differences aside, the Mahdists' tactics were suicidal) without slandering Churchill.<br /><br />These would be minor details, except that they run on for pages.  He reminds me of an undergraduate trying to \\"B.S.\\" on an essay exam.  He throws out lots of \\"facts\\", but correlates them poorly, offers little synthesis, and no original insight.<br /><br />His chapters on terrorism and nuclear war are particularly disappointing, follow the same empty pattern, promising much, delivering virtually nothing.<br /><br />This is not a scholarly book in any sense, in spite of its pretensions.  There are no footnotes, just general references to secondary sources.  His \\"bibliographical essay\\" is mostly an exercise in self-aggrandizement at the expense of his betters, including everyone from Sun Tzu to Lidell Hart.<br /><br />I happened to be reading William H. McNeill's \\"The Pursuit of Power\\" at the same time as I read van Creveld's book, and noted with surprise that van Creveld appears to have cribbed his outline and much of his narrative directly from McNeill.  I can't find language specific enough to accuse van Creveld of direct plagiarism, but it seems pretty clear that van Creveld just superficially reworked sections of McNeill's book, particularly in the early chapters, and then had the nerve in his \\"bibliographic essay\\" to say McNeill's proof of his thesis is unsuccessful!  McNeill in fact substantiates his somewhat complex thesis quite well, far better than van Creveld does for his own simple-minded ideas.  van Creveld got his PhD from the London School of Economics, while McNeill was a world-famous professor of history at the University of Chicago, which is no doubt sufficient explanation for van Creveld's \\"dog in the manger\\" attitude toward McNeill.<br /><br />In my opinion, van Creveld's book is not only unsuccessful, it is disreputable, and shouldn't have been published.<br /><br />(Van Creveld's November 2004 paper entitled \\"Why Iraq Will End as Vietnam Did\\" shows that neither his powers of analysis nor his writing have improved with time.)icient explanation for van Creveld's \\"dog in the manger\\" attitude toward McNeill.

US	47014068	R7FPEHNK0U8YI	0679640576	218999601	The American Revolution: A History (Modern Library Chronicles)	Books	5	76	82	N	N	A short book that will expand your mind.	I was pleasantly surprised by this book.  It is written by a professor at an Ivy League university (Brown), and yet from reading his book I am unable to determine his personal political leanings.  Either he thinks the same way I do, or he is that \\"rara avis\\", a historian whose only ax to grind is that of the search for objective truth about the past.    He is a superb writer.  There is not a dull sentence in the book, and the narrative flows like a good novel.  It is a brief book, intended to be an introduction for general readers as part of a Modern Library series, and yet as a knowledgeable but non-specialist reader of the period, I learned something new on almost every page.  Professor Wood has made himself one with the Revolutionary era, and has at the same time cultivated the ability to describe it clearly to us moderns.  I suspect he was an excellent classroom instructor for freshmen students.      These quotations illustrate his insightful thought and graceful style:    \\"... the Revolution was not only about home rule; it was also about who should rule at home.\\"    \\"The Revolution, like the whole of American history, is not a simple morality play; it is a complicated and often ironic story that needs to be explained and understood, not celebrated or condemned.\\"    Note the skillful use of the semicolon, the mark of a good prose stylist, and the concise expression of some very complex concepts in two brief sentences.    In a few pages he discusses in a very lucid manner a number of very complicated subjects, for example, the conflict between Burke's theory of \\"virtual\\" representation and the experience of \\"actual\\" representation in the new frontier towns of the American colonies, the development of a new conception of sovereignty as residing in the people to explain the proposed Constitution of 1789, the commonality of ideas shared by the Puritans of the English Civil War and the American revolutionists of a century later, the basis for the continued and unique American belief that we are \\"exceptional\\", outside the mainstream of history, and uniquely chosen as guardians of human freedom.    Wood delves rather deeply into the evolution of American religious belief and practice and its effect on American society in the post-Revolutionary era.  He also succinctly outlines the effect of the Revolution on slavery and women's rights.    He devotes only 12 pages to The War of Independence, and yet in that brief space gives a surprisingly complete and detailed picture of the military, political, and diplomatic course of the war. His comments on the strategic problems of each side are quite incisive, and his narrative is much clearer than Higginbotham's, for example.    The last chapters on the social and political changes set off by the Revolution are his best.  I'm not a big fan of the \\"new history\\" emphasis on social and economic issues.  I think history is mostly about war and politics, in that order.  But Professor Wood shows that my prejudice is absurd, that history is history, war and politics can't be separated from culture and money, and that it is all interesting.       He probably doesn't emphasize enough the origin of the problems in the Constitution that led to its ultimate failure in the crisis of 1860.  But that is a complicated subject, and he lays a sufficient groundwork for further study of that issue.    The bibiographic essay at the end is superb.      I didn't notice any typos - apparently the publisher has corrected in subsequent printings the \\"Yorktown, Pennsylvania\\" error noted by a previous reviewer.    Recommended without reservation.    Note:  (April 15, 2007)  For a broader view of Gordon Wood's thought I highly recommend the review that recently appeared in the Winter 2006/07 edition of the \\"Claremont Review of Books\\", V. VII, #1, pps. 27-30, by Steven F. Hayward, entitled \\"The Liberal Republicanism of Gordon Wood.\\"	2005-02-25

Prof. Taylor teaches philosophy at Oxford University, and clearly knows his subject.  However, his writing style leaves much to be desired.  He tends to be convoluted and verbose, with too many parentheses.  This is fine for an academic paper, but not for \\"A Very Short Introduction\\".  He is worst in the first three chapters, in which he reviews Socrates' life and historical context.  His discussion of \\"the Socratic problem\\" in chapter 3 drags at times, but if you plow through it, ends up being actually pretty good.  However, it does not compare for clarity and crispness of reasoning with the discussions of the problem by Prof. Vlastos.  <br /> <br />Taylor's style does not improve in Chapter 4, on the Socrates of Plato, but I found that in spite of his occasional incoherence there is something of value in this chapter.  He does a good job of laying out Plato's approach to the problem of the nature of morality, and his ultimate failure in that project.  His comments on Plato's defense of Socrates against the Sophists are quite good,  although I've just started The Republic myself, so I may have to revise this opinion later. <br /> <br />Chapter 5, Socrates' influence on later philosophers, including the Skeptics, Cynics, and Stoics in the Hellenistic period, and then in the 19th century Hegel, Kierkegaard,and Nietzsche, was quite illuminating.  All three 19th century philosophers were obsessed with Socrates, and each saw him and used him in his own unique way.  He emphasizes the kinship between Socrates and Nietzsche in particular.  This is clearly the area that interests Prof. Taylor most, where he put in most of his effort, with good and useful results.  His style is noticeable tighter and clearer in this chapter. <br /> <br />Those who have no background in philosophy at all should not start with this book.  Those who are in the process of learning some philosophy, perhaps at an intermediate level, should with a little patience find something of interest here.  Those who wish to have a deeper understanding of Socrates life and thought should, after reading this book, by all means go on to read the two volumes of the master, Prof. Gregory Vlastos, Socrates:  Ironist and Moral Philosopher, and Socratic Studies.	2005-02-23
US	47014068	R2HFGSLZWTHD1B	0399151753	462275401	The Pentagon's New Map: War and Peace in the Twenty-First Century	Books	5	15	22	N	N	An important, but TERRIBLE book.	Barnett has a PhD in political science from Harvard University, which, like many people who have gone to Harvard, is the first thing he tells you about himself.  He thinks this means he is very smart, which he also tells you, over and over and over and over again.  He also KNOWS a lot of very smart and important and powerful people, who may also have gone to Harvard, which he also tells you ad nauseum (that means until you want to throw up, in case you're wondering).    This is basically the story of how Barnett went from Harvard to Washington and found THAT ONE SLIDE that made his career in the big-time, as an important \\"pol-mil\\" analyst.  He tells you all this, and much, much more, in the first part of his book, up to page 154.  It just gets worse from there until it finally ends on page 389.    In the course of this book we learn that Barnett has lots of important friends and acquaintances, that he works 18 hour days holed up in Pentagon briefing rooms with admirals who yell at each other, that he singlehandedly showed the Pentagon how to do their job right, that he left his wife to eat Thanksgiving dinner alone in order to spend time in briefing rooms with admirals, that he is a Democrat (no surprise there), and that his wife (\\"a card-carrying member of the ACLU\\") worries that he is becoming a Republican.    We learn a new language for expressing old ideas:  \\"globalization\\" means \\"American world hegemony\\", \\"disconnectedness\\" means \\"no one has cell phones or computers\\", \\"the Gap\\" and \\"lesser includeds\\" mean \\"poverty-stricken countries\\" (what used to be called \\"The Third World\\") - you get the idea.  New lingo, old ideas.     We learn that Gorbachev really deserves the credit for the fall of the Soviet Union, not Reagan (although I don't think Gorby really meant for things to come out that way), that \\"the world has effectively surrendered the seas to the US Navy, and it has done so out of immense trust that America will not abuse that unprecedented power\\", that theBush administration has engaged in \\"bone-headed\\" diplomacy and \\"political gamesmanship of the most venal sort\\", and that when we \\"successfully exported that rule set to the other great powers\\" (he means the fall of the Soviet Union), \\"the threat of global war basically ended in human history\\".    The full onslaught of this incoherent torrent of self-referential egomaniacal Wilsonianism has to be experienced to be believed.  I would recommend that every American tax-payer read this book at least up to page 154 just to get a feel for the kind of clap-trap we are paying for in Washington.  One can only pray that Barnett is a flash in the pan, and will not be taken too seriously.    He has an action plan, which starts on page 379:    1.  Democratize Iraq (he calls it \\"reconnecting\\" Iraq)  2.  Get rid of Kim Jong Il and unify Korea  3.  Foment counterrevolution in Iran  4.  Form a Free Trade Area of the Americas  5.  Pressure the Saudis to stop funding Islamic maddrassahs, by shifting our automobiles to fuel cells  6.  Develop a military and financial alliance with China  7.  Form an Asian NATO  8.  Merge that Asian NATO with NAFTA and the European NATO  9.  Admit a dozen more states to the US (presumably from Mexico and Central America), with the first Mexican president of the US coming from a Mexican state.  10.  Africa just will have to wait until the Middle East is pacified (\\"integrated into The Core\\")    The first three of these goals aren't total moonshine, except that Barnett doesn't tell us how we are going to accomplish them, other than through the use of military force, as in Iraq.  I suppose that's the Pentagon's problem, now that Barnett has pointed them in the right direction.  As to the rest of it, it's highly unlikely that Mexico WANTS  to be a part of the US, and Africa may or may not be willing to \\"wait its turn\\".  History is not nearly as predictable as Barnett seems to think.  Of course, overwhelming military superiority tends to make things go your way, as long as it lasts.    Whether or not American world hegemony is a good thing for either America or the world is something people of good will may have honest disagreements about, but don't look for that discussion in The Pentagon's New Map.  And if Barnett wants to call American world hegemony \\"globalization\\", I don't think anyone is going to argue the point with him, as long as 12 nuclear carrier battle groups and a large fleet of advanced attack nuclear submarines like the James E. Carter are there to back him up.  However, it is highly unlikely that the world's problems are going to be solved by giving everyone cell phones and access to internet pornography, or even by giving women political power.  We've had quite a few wars since women got the right to vote in America.    Barnett restrains himself from talking about himself long enough to make a couple of good, though unoriginal, points, namely that there is a strong relationship between military power and economic prosperity, and that we should try to avoid forcing China into a corner where they feel they have no choice but to fight us, like we did to Japan in the 1930's.  But these points have been made better by other people, and wading through Barnett's tedious self-aggrandizement is too high a price to pay for these couple of nuggets of truth.    The book would be more readable if it had been edited, instead of being merely a verbatim regurgitation of Barnett's Pentagon briefings.  Some elementary copy editing would also help:  I don't think \\"static quo\\", used twice by Barnett, is a word in the English language.  But no amount of editing will improve Barnett's half-baked ideas.    5 stars because the book is being read by important people, minus 5 stars for sloppy editing and out-of-control narcissism.	2005-02-22

The story itself is so outlandish, bizarre, and terrifying that it would be unbelievable as fiction, yet it reads better than most novels.  Toland is an excellent writer and tells his complex story exceedingly well.  He interviewed hundreds of people for this work, an incredible expenditure of time and energy, and his historical sources are well referenced.    Toland hasn't made any major errors in substance, so far as I can see, but his interpretations do have a pro-Japanese bias, in that he wants Japan to get a fair hearing.  I think that is a legitimate goal, but those who were Japan's direct victims would have, with good reason, difficulty accepting it.  It should be kept in mind that whatever the sins of the Japanese government and military during that era, the Japanese people were punished for them many times over as the war evolved.    The early chapters may seem tedious to some readers, but this is due to the complexity of Japanese politics in the 1930's.  Toland describes in these chapters something that needs emphasis, and that is the role of political assassination in pre-war Japanese politics.  Japanese politicians of that time lived with the knowledge that fanatical young military officers could at any time undo all their work by an assassination, and that there was no way to prevent it so long as the military was in control.  A political culture that condones assassination is unlikely to be one in which reason and common sense prevail.  Most of the decision makers in the Japanese government, from Konoye and Tojo on down, knew that Japan would inevitably lose an all-out war with the US.  Yet until the very end, they all seemed to feel powerless to follow anything other than a suicidal course of action. And at the end, many leaders, including Konoye and Anami, along with numerous military officers, took their own lives.  Tojo was unsuccessful inhis suicide attempt, and lived to be hanged.  Interestingly, he became quite religious before his death, and expressed remorse for the atrocities inflicted by the Japanese Army.    Toland uses first person narratives very effectively to describe the fanaticism and suicidal bravery of the Japanese soldiers, sailors, and pilots; the sufferings of the American POW's; and of the Japanese civilian population under the incendiary and A-bomb attacks on Japan's cities.  The overall effect is horrifying; one wonders that anyone survived.    Toland raises many legitimate questions regarding America's role in the Pacific War, from cultural differences to poor translations to overt racism.  He ends the book with some interesting reflections on the continuities of misguided American policies and attitudes that led from our war with Japan to our war in VietNam.      A few firm conclusions can be drawn from the war experiences Toland describes so well:    There is no such thing as a \\"good\\" war, or if there is, the war in the Pacific was certainly not one of them.   Human courage and endurance transcend race and culture, as do human cruelty and stupidity.    America and Japan were both changed irrevocably by the Pacific War.    Neither nation came out of the war morally intact.      So far, nuclear weapons have not again been used in anger.      One can only hope that our luck continues to hold.	2005-02-20
US	47014068	R2LUL6KGVKVZLG	0684863316	419002241	Alexander Hamilton, American	Books	5	6	7	N	N	5 stars for Hamilton, but Brookhiser is disappointing	I read this book while at the same time reading The Federalist Papers.  Whatever one's opinion is of Hamilton's political beliefs, he was an extremely persuasive writer.  As I read his articles supporting the new constitution I felt transported back to 1787, as though I were reading them in today's newspaper.  They are as fresh today as the day Hamilton wrote them, his passion making the issues come alive on the page.  Hamilton's vivid style makes Brookhiser's dry and stilted prose all the more obvious by contrast.  Brookhiser reads like a PhD thesis, not a brief popular biography.  The facts are there, but Hamilton is dead on the page. To feel Hamilton come alive, read The Federalist, not Brookhiser.  To be fair to Brookhiser, he repeatedly comments on Hamilton's persuasive writing style, even though he is himself unable to emulate it.    Brookhiser clearly dislikes both Jefferson and Burr, Hamilton's major political antagonists, but he does not present those conflicts with the vividness and drama they deserve.    Curiously, nowhere in Brookhiser's fairly detailed account of Hamilton's long entanglement with Maria Reynolds does he mention his wife Betsy's reaction to the relationship.  Hamilton was clearly a complicated man, who inspired great loyalty and admiration in spite of his faults.  But Betsy must have had something to say about the whole thing.    Brookhiser says almost nothing about Hamilton's military record, which was impressive by any standard.        Hamilton was far more conservative than anyone on the American political scene today.  Still, he was a subtle and complex thinker.  Hamilton persuaded Americans to accept a constitution that was (and is) much more conservative than the general temper of the majority of the American people.  He convinced them to accept a government none of them wanted, in spite of themselves, by demonstrating clearly and repeatedly the dangerous position the American States were in due to the incompetence of the Continental Congress and the inherent weakness of the Articles of Confederation, and how badly they needed a strong central government.  Hamilton's urgency and concern practically leap off of every page of The Federalist, on  issues that trouble American politics to this day.  Brookhiser manages to make it all seem like old news, dry as dry toast.      A minor point:  I found that the quirky typeface made the book more difficult to read, especially with all the quotations.    In spite of its shortcomings, this book should be read by every thinking American, regardless of political persuasion.  Even more important is to read Hamilton himself, in The Federalist, in order to understand how and why our form of ordered political liberty came into being.	2005-02-20

Prof. Vlastos writes very clearly and makes his arguments step by step so that there is no mistaking his point, which you are then able to judge for yourself.  He is persuasive, not dogmatic, but you have to be able to follow his train of reasoning.<br /><br />In my opinion, it is unfair to accuse Prof. Vlastos of \\"special pleading\\", that is, presenting only evidence that supports his own arguments.  Vlastos spent his life studying Socrates, and no doubt developed strong feelings for the object of his study, but it seems to me that he goes to great lengths to acknowledge evidence contradicting his own conclusions.  But Vlastos makes his points very thoroughly, so if you want to quibble with him you have to have your own ducks in a row.<br /><br />Vlastos covers the following topics:<br /><br />  -  Socratic Irony.<br /><br />  -  The \\"Socratic problem\\" - what we can know about Socrates as an actual historical figure, as opposed to the various impressions handed down to us by Aristophanes, Plato, Xenophon, and others.<br /><br />  -  The shift from the Socratic method (\\"elenchus\\") to mathematics in Plato's middle dialogues.<br /><br />  -  Does Socrates cheat?  (Yes, but only in jest.)<br /><br />  -  Socrates' religious beliefs.  (He believed in his \\"daimonion\\", but was not a mystic.)<br /><br />  -  Socrates' rejection of the \\"lex talionis\\".  (I found this to be by far the most interesting chapter, Socrates articulating the \\"Golden Rule\\" 400 years before Christ.)<br /><br />  -  An explication of Socrates' theory that Happiness and Virtue are identical.<br /><br />Vlastos concludes that Socrates, believing what he believed, died a happy man.<br /><br />Anyone interested in philosophy will benefit from spending a few hours with Professor Gregory Vlastos and his friend, Socrates.	2005-02-16
US	47014068	R3DVFQW4PEW2FK	0192853570	391413545	Ancient Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Excellent little book	I am a beginning student of philosophy, and found Professor Annas' book to be extremely helpful.  Not only does she provide a sophisticated introduction to ancient Greek thought, she gives the best definition of philosophy I have yet come across:  the search for truth by reasoned argument.  These are two major accomplishments for a very small book.    She manages to cover the pre-Socrates, Socrates, Plato, the Sophists, Aristotle, the Stoics, the Skeptics, the Cynics and many others. She covers Plato and Aristotle in surprising depth.  Her comments on the others are more brief, but they are to the point and meaningful.  She demonstrates very clearly the relevence of ancient Greek thought to the problems we face in our own time.    She uses each chapter to introduce and discuss a major philosophical topic:  Ancient theories of personality are exemplified by the various treatments of the Medea legend, she gives an account of the evolution of the interpretations of Plato's Republic, of what constitutes a happy life and how to achieve it, what is knowledge and how do we think of it, and the beginnings of logical reasoning and theories of reality.  The Greeks didn't make these distinctions, but there you have most of the branches of modern philosophy:  theory of personality, ethics, epistimology, metaphysics, and logic.  Prof. Annas' book is much more sophisticated than it at first appears.    I have only one complaint:  Like many feminists, she takes the English language convention that the impersonal third-person pronoun is masculine or neuter, (\\"he, him\\" or \\"one\\") never feminine (\\"she, her\\"), personally, and at the oddest momentss plonks down a \\"she\\" where a \\"he\\" or \\"one\\" would normally be expected.  This is of course a common device in feminist writing, designed to make a statement about the oppressiveness of Western society in general and the English language in particular.  This detracts from her otherwise exemplary prose style.  Fortunately, she avoids feminist rhetoric otherwise, even in her discussion of Medea.    The single best thing about this book is that it makes one want to read more.	2005-02-11
US	47014068	R2XIGI4WT4AJNF	1565840399	418055365	Japan at War: An Oral History	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Fascinating, informative, nightmarish, essential reading	This book should be read by anyone with an interest in Japan, military history, or the extremes of human behavior.   <br />  <br />The book is structured chronologically, with each section introduced by an overview of the military and political situation.  The interviewees are introduced and described with tact and skill, and great effort is made to present the people objectively, allowing them to tell their own stories.  The interpretive comments are brief but very helpful.  The summaries of the military and political situations are skillfully done. <br /> <br />The credibility of the content of the narratives varies.  The Cooks provide enough background material to judge where many of the weaknesses in each narrative lie, but some of the more contentious episodes may never be objectively verified.  There is no reason to think they COULDN'T have happened, but that isn't the same as saying that they DID happen.  Much objective information has been lost or destroyed in the \\"fog of war\\" and post-war collective amnesia. <br /> <br />I suspect the Cooks just barely scratch the surface of the Japanese war experience with this book.  The Japanese historically have viewed defeat as shameful, and therefore not to be spoken of.  While Japan has changed greatly since 1945, I doubt that such basic Japanese attitudes have changed all that much.  The Cooks raise, but do not begin to answer, questions about the complicity of the Japanese military in atrocities, the concept of war \\"crimes\\", \\"victors' justice\\", etc.  No doubt the Rape of Nanking, the Bataan Death March, the building of the Siam-Burma Railroad with prisoner labor were war crimes, as defined by the Geneva Conventions.  Were the firebombing of Tokyo or the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki therefore justifiable war tactics?  Would the path to victory envisioned by the American Naval Plan Orange, blockade and starvation of the Home Islands, for years, if necessary, have been a more acceptable alternative?  Of course these issues are beyond the scope of the book, but they lurk in the background for anyone reading it. <br /> <br />The Cooks do not directly address the issue of the culpability of Emperor Hirohito in the war and the manner in which the Japanese military prosecuted it.  Several of the interviewees comment on it in passing, but there doesn't seem to be a consistent view.   <br /> <br />\\"The Pacific War\\", as the Japanese call it when referring to the conflict with America and England, was a complete disaster for Japan, a total defeat of an intensely proud and patriotic nation.  The responsibility for the military defeat rests squarely with the Japanese High Command, their strategic blindness, arrogance and incompetence, their lack of insight into their own military weaknesses, and their complete underestimation of the military capacity and determination of the Americans.  The responsibility of other sections of Japanese society, the businessmen and financiers, the politicians, the average soldier, the Emperor himself, the fanatically indocrinated civilian population, is more difficult to parcel out.  All played a greater or lesser part, but the guilt and shame attached to any one participant's actions are for the most part difficult to judge.  The Japanese collective decision to keep silent and hope everyone forgets about it, while unrealistic, may be the best they can do under the circumstances.   <br /> <br />The confusion of the average Japanese participant comes through very clearly in these stories.  The Cooks put it very well:  \\"Japanese narratives of the Pacific War often descend precipitously from brief tales of victory and joy (or relief, or even anxiety) into a shapeless nightmare of plotless slaughter.\\" <br /> <br />Japan is now democratic and free, and has the fourth largest military establishment in the world.  No doubt Japanese forces will someday once again go to war.  The memory of The Pacific War, \\"The 15 Year War\\", if the war in China is included, how it was fought, the suffering inflicted on all civilian populations save the Americans, the devastating and complete defeat of Japanese forces and the destruction of the Japanese homeland, will no doubt influence how those forces are used in the future.  The  Cooks, particularly Haruko, deserve great credit for addressing this difficult subject, and for having the skill and resourcefulness to conduct these interviews, to save these memories for future generations to learn from.   <br />	2005-01-29

I went to the trouble of reading this book because of the reputation of the author, who is editor of the Oxford Companion to Archeology.  However, after the first two or three chapters, I resorted to rapid skimming in order to mitigate the repeated insults Prof. Fagan dealt to my intelligence.<br /><br />We learn many things from this book:  That Fagan has sailed the Bay of Biscay and the Gulf Stream, seen the wall paintings of Niaux, flown over France, viewed the Mesopotamian desert before Saddam built a military airport near it, driven a Land Rover through the Egyptian Desert, wandered Chaco Canyon in the twilight, visited the Great Plaza at Tikal a number of times, and heard Mozart's Requiem in St. Paul's Cathedral.  This would be very interesting if we were reading a travel diary, but does nothing to advance his thesis.  It is clearly \\"filler\\", designed to make the book more marketable to a general audience.<br /><br />Lakes and rivers always \\"teem\\" with fish.  Droughts, floods and other \\"environmental shocks\\" are always \\"devastating\\".  Ancient merchants are \\"watchful\\", and their ships are \\"battered\\".  Gorges are always \\"deep\\", and palaces \\"rich\\". Climatic change is always \\"breathtaking\\".  Cliche follows cliche, until one's eyes droop.<br /><br />The faults of Fagan's substantive material are much graver.  Of course, the weather affects human activity, and always has.  One need do no more than watch the Weather Channel to learn that.  Relating remote climate change to remote changes in human civilization is another matter.  Fagan uses the conditional tense incessantly and qualifies every conclusion.  Authorities \\"believe\\".  We can \\"only speculate\\".  We shall \\"never know\\".  We \\"cannot be sure\\".<br /><br />After wading through 250 pages of impressions and speculations, we come to Fagan's final conclusion:  \\"Climate has helped shape civilization, but not by being benign.\\"  I think the average citizen watching television is already aware of this.  What else does Fagan have to offer us?  \\"There's no reason to assume that we've somehow escaped this shaping process.\\"  The average reader would no doubt agree, even if he or she had missed the worst Florida hurricane season in 50 years while on an archeological dig in the Gobi Desert.<br /><br />He comes to his punchline in the last paragraph of the book, comparing modern civilization to a supertanker, asserting that we are becoming increasingly vulnerable to catastrophic climatic change, and that the people in charge are ignoring the problem.  His last sentence is a highly melodramatic elaboration of this theme:  \\"And no one dares to whisper in the helmsman's ear that he might consider turning the wheel.\\"<br /><br />What are we to think of all this?  Fagan asserts that human activity has contributed to global warming, but nowhere gives any of the details that would substantiate this belief.  He gives a much more believable explanation for climate change by citing the effect of changes in the Earth's orbital parameters and their effects on light levels.  But his overall presentation points to only one really firm conclusion:  climate change is inevitable, and is due to multiple variables that are very poorly understood in our current state of knowledge.  Whether the Earth's climate is going to become cooler or warmer is anyone's guess.  It will no doubt do both at different times, with multiple unpredictable effects.<br /><br />While Fagan makes vague assertions about global warming, he seems to be intelligent enough to realize that the data to support the human contribution to it are weak.  He implies that \\"the Helmsman\\", (no doubt George W. Bush) could do something about it, but refuses.  Fagan certainly knows that whatever action human beings take is likely to have very little effect on the kind of catastrophic climate change he describes throughout his book, but he and his publisher also know that that conclusion doesn't conform with the current \\"zeitgeist\\", and therefore won'tsell books.  So, he implies, hints, surmises, but in the end comes up only with a gloomy vagueness.  One of course wonders, why bother?  Well, I guess professors gotta eat, just like everyone else.<br /><br />I prefer Mark Twain's more honest and MUCH more succinct analysis:  \\"Everyone complains about the weather, but no one ever does anything about it.\\"he end comes up only with a gloomy vagueness.  One of course wonders, why bother?  Well, I guess professors gotta eat, just like everyone else.    I prefer Mark Twain's more honest and MUCH more succinct analysis:  \\"Everyone complains about the weather, but no one ever does anything about it.\\"	2004-10-15

I immediately disliked the book, but forced myself to read carefully the first chapter so I could be more specific about what it was that I disliked.  I was reminded of Steven Pinker's comment in [ASIN:0060958332 The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language (Perennial Classics)]]about how poorly most linguists use the written English language.    I then read the reviews of the previous (third) edition, including the pan by a linguistics graduate student, who noted numerous factual errors, and the criticism of a student who found the format user-unfriendly.    The format of the fourth edition has not been improved.  The type is difficult to read and the layout unimaginative.  It reminds me of the manuals written for computer programs.    The language style is verbose and vague, and the tone pompous and patronizing.  It seems to be written with the lowest common denominator in mind. I suspect he has in mind the students in the Schools of Education, who are among the lowest on the IQ curve among college students. This is no excuse:  education students are going to teach our children, and deserve well-written textbooks just as much as philosophy majors.    His political views are \\"snuck\\" (or \\"sneaked\\", if you prefer) into the text in various cutesy ways, typically resulting in confusing more than clarifying contentious issues.  I suspect this is a deliberate strategy for appearing to be neutral on such subjects, while at the same time advancing his own viewpoint.  Contrast Finegan's slovenly discussion of the issue of \\"Standard English\\" with that of David Crystal in [ASIN:0521530334 The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language]], which is a model of clarity, without being in the slightest doctrinaire or judgemental.  Crystal's point is that there are good practical reasons for attemptingto identify a \\"standard\\" version of the English language, even if it is used only by a small minority of users of English.  Finegan clearly disapproves of standards of any kind for language use, but since he can't mount an intellectually respectable defense of his position, and even freely admits that he has written his book in Standard American English so that it can be read \\"in many parts of the world\\", he resorts to fudging the issue instead of clarifying it.    Finegan similarly slyly advances his own tendentious views on multilingualism, immigration, \\"cultivated\\" or \\"received\\" pronunciation, and animal languages.  He implies that the issue of chimpanzee use of language is still an open question, when in fact it has been clearly demonstrated that language acquisition is uniquely human, and there is no demonstrable continuity between chimpanzee use of signs and human use of language.      The lack of coverage of the neuroanatomic and neurophysiological basis of language function is notable, a weakness that no doubt reflects Finegan's personal bias toward social determinism noted in the discussion of chimpanzee \\"language\\".      There is much useful information in this book, and Finegan is no doubt a competent scholar of linguistics.  Too bad he isn't a better writer, and more open-minded.    Lastly, the book is far too expensive for what it is.  Buy it used, if you need it for a class.	2004-04-04
US	47014068	RU0QDWH8HDTR5	0813320801	305279417	Crete: The Battle And The Resistance (History and Warfare)	Books	3	15	22	N	N	Thorough, but disappointing.	After reading this book, I felt that I understood what happened on Crete from 1941-45 and why, but I also wondered how in the world the British ever thought they were going to win a war if they fought it like they did on Crete.  Beevor chronicles the arrogance, frivolousness, ignorance, stupidity, wilfulness, and lack of attention to detail of the British officer class unsparingly.  Unfortunately, being of that class himself, he often unconsciously exhibits that same flippant, arrogant English schoolboy attitude in his writing, which is the major flaw of the book.      Beevor does justice to the bravery and endurance of the German paratroopers, the Commonwealth troops, and the Cretan people and Resistance fighters.  He is a skillful narrator, and he brings the people to life, all of which compensates somewhat for the flippant tone.  He has eliminated that tone from his subsequent books on Stalingrad and Berlin, with great improvement in the power of his writing.  Would that he had done so in describing the campaign on Crete, which was every bit as serious as Stalingrad and Berlin, especially to the participants.	2004-02-28
US	47014068	R3RMB87DZGYQHA	0521530334	227682660	The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language	Books	4	37	41	N	N	Anglocentric	I have truly enjoyed reading this book, and recommend it highly to anyone interested in learning about the English language.  It is easy to read, clear, and authoritative.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that Mr. Crystal seems to hold the subtly snobbish attitude toward American literature and language still prevalent among the educated class in Britain.  He gives due credit to Benjamin Franklin, Noah Webster, Edgar Allen Poe, and H.L. Mencken, but dismisses Mark Twain as being simply a humorist with vaguely racist tendencies, and fails to even mention Hawthorne, Melville, or Longfellow, the leaders of the 19th century American Renaissance, who succeeded in creating a distinctive American literature, separate from the English tradition.  He also fails to mention Stephen Crane and Ernest Hemingway, but includes Burton Raffles, Peter Sellers (twice), and John Le Carre.     At the same time, I sometimes have the feeling that we Americans have merely borrowed the English language, and don't understand it, love it, and use it the way the English do.  For us, English is handy tool, but if something better came along we would abandon it without a second thought, whereas the English will always speak English.  And Hawthorne, Melville, and Longfellow may be more widely read in the UK these days than they are in their own country.  Mr. Crystal obviously loves the English language, and writes about it with lucidity and affection.  So my complaint is a back-handed compliment, in a way, and I would not discourage anyone from buying and reading this book from cover to cover.	2004-02-13
US	47014068	R3OTA0ELH64Z8R	0333443217	121134636	The Enigma of Japanese Power: People and Politics in a Stateless Nation	Books	3	19	30	N	N	Chomskyan hatchet job on Japan	van Wolferen had the benefit of living in Japan for 20 years as a journalist without ever having learned to read or write Japanese.  One wonders how much credibility Americans would give a book about American culture and politics written by a journalist who had lived in the US for 20 years without learning to read or write English.      But that's not the problem with van Wolferen:  Ruth Benedict and Lafcadio Hearn wrote worthwhile books about Japan without learning the language, in Benedict's case without even having visited Japan.  The problem is van Wolferen's style and thesis.      His style is tendentious, full of false premises, unwarranted assumptions, unsubstantiated assertions, and hysterical exaggeration. His thesis is that Japan is a uniquely evil country, much like Noam Chomsky's attitude toward America.      Here is a small example:  In Chapter 15 \\"The Japanese Phoenix\\" van Wolferen states:  \\"The most famous slogan of the Meiji period was 'fukoku kyohei', 'rich country, strong military', and the response to the real or imaginary external threat was an effort to make Japan invincible.\\"    Well, what about that external threat?  Was it \\"real\\" or was it \\"imaginary\\"?  van Wolferen by offering us the two alternatives implies that the Japanese imagined or at least seriously  exaggerated the external threat.  And was the goal truly to be \\"invincible\\", or was it just to be competitive?      In actual fact, the external threat was all too real.  The Shogunate was overwhelmed by the power of the small but well-armed flotilla Commodore Perry brought to Tokyo Bay in 1853.  The Shogunate's military forces had nothing even remotely comparable to Perry's \\"black ships\\". The shelling and burning of Kagoshima in 1863 by the British Royal Navy and the destruction of the guns guarding the Straits of Shimonoseki by naval bombardment in 1864 by a Four Power flotilla (British, French, Dutch, and American) underlined the point that the Japanese were powerless against Western military force.  They also had before them the example of China, the source of Japanese  High Culture, which was at that time being systematically dismembered by the European powers.  The message was clear:  Japan was going to share China's fate if it did not modernize.      Doesn't seem like an \\"imaginary\\" threat to me.  And \\"invincible\\"?  What about just \\"competitive with the Western powers\\"? - which was in fact the real goal of the Meiji Restoration.    This is just one small example.  Every page abounds with similar distortions.  Interestingly, van Wolferen explicitly states at the outset, on page 24, that he is not interested in objective analysis.       Chalmers Johnson inspired van Wolferen to write this book, and reviewed it extensively.  If you share Johnson's neo-Leftist conspiratorial world view, you will find van Wolferen compelling reading.  If you are interested in learning about Japan as it really is, don't bother reading this book.	2004-02-06
US	47014068	R2JCH1NVDCENSH	0804718350	617876754	Nomonhan: Japan Against Russia, 1939	Books	5	18	18	N	N	Why you should read this book.	Although this book is indeed long, it does not seem long because it is very well written.  The subject is fascinating as well, deepening and clarifying one's understanding of the causes and conduct of WWII.  The fact that this was a modern military campaign fought in the heartland of the former Mongol Empire adds to the interest.  The Japanese were a long way from home at Nomonhan.<br /><br />His description of the hardships of the Japanese troops is very poignant.  A particularly important point foreshadowing the conduct and course of the Pacific War was the assumption by the officer corps that the bravery and endurance of Japanese troops would make up for grave deficiencies in their equipment and supply.  The Japanese troops were of course profoundly brave, going to great lengths to rescue pieces of regimental flags, in a manner reminiscent of 18th century warfare, and attacking and defeating Russian tanks with cider bottles filled with gasoline.  Coox notes that in the later phases of the campaign the Russians used diesel powered tanks, which negated the effectiveness of the \\"Molotov cocktail\\" attacks.  This forshadowing of the attitudes and tactics of the Japanese Army alone makes the book well worth reading for any student of American military history.<br /><br />Perhaps a more important point, one that really isn't made in Coox's book, and a piece of the puzzle only put together for me while recently reading Russia and the West under Lenin and Stalin by George Kennan, is that this campaign occurred at the same time as the Munich debacle in Europe, and was one of the factors motivating Stalin to reach an accomodation with Hitler in the notorious Non-Aggression Pact of 1939.  Stalin was well aware of Soviet military weakness and was desperate to avoid simultaneous war with Germany and Japan.<br /><br />Several reviewers commented on the lack of coverage of the Soviet side of the campaign.  I don't consider this a deficiency, if it is understood at the outset that this is a description of the Japanese side.  The Soviet side of the story has yet to be told, so far as I know.  One can hope that whoever eventually tells it will tell it half as well as Coox has told the Japanese side.	2003-07-20
