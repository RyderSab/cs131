There are two depths to this story and I dont mean intellectual, but rather you can decide to coast it and bounce from place to place accepting or you can pick the people you like and the ones you dont. Either way is perfectly fine, but it gives one different perspectives I beleive. I did both, choosing to side with some and dislike others but ultimately to tag along with the story and watch it. It is probably the weirdest yet most accurate thing I have ever read. The reality of it is frightening, and truthfully I hope the human society never reaches such a level. A human race laced with cold emotionless joy, nothing to fear (which is a defining factor in each of us) life carries itself it out with no point. Only a few who are considered essentially odd and one who has not been brought up in this terrifying surrounding but rather in the &quot;inferrior&quot; native culture can recognize any fault with society (which incidentally is the only reason this system works - every one is happy with it because there isnt any other way). It is almost to weird to read but its not really and if followed, it proves both margianally disatsifying but utterly rewarding.	2001-05-28

US	49129533	RNQDYRO0ZF7D8	0345350499	627223385	The Mists of Avalon	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Penetratingly Profound	The Mists of Avalon is one of the most deep and profound books I have ever read. It is a beautifully written Arthurain legand that uncovers the frailty of human emotions and the monumental influence gods or godesses have over simple men. It gave me the chance to wander through King Arthurs Courts and to part the Mists of Avalon. To live in the time of glorious knights and experience inborn chivalry first hand. The most fascinating thing about this tale is the the characters who are very alive and very real. They demand that you really care about them. Morgaine and Gwenwhyfar command overwhelming depression at times, and then power and glory or lovliness and romance at others. I think Lancelot must have been the most desireable man on Earth (or in Avalon) while Accolan had the most amazing inner self. This is one of the deepest and most passionate and complicated  stories ever written. I read it in great gulps, which I beleive is more than likely the only way possible to read it, but I truly regret that now, for if I had read it more slowly it would have lasted all the longer. This is one of the most beautiful works in the world. It is a charismatic book that presents itself proudly on my bookshelf.	2001-05-27

However, my literature class required me to read a biography, which I must admit, I looked upon with much dismay. I happen to be a very lucky indeed, though, because I had really been meaning to read this book forever (I happen to have known Joyce Anders since I was very young and I love her very much, but my review isnt biased), and what could have been a more opportune time than this? I read it with growing relish and it proved to be a very fascinating book indeed. I loved it and I hope other people have enjoyed reading Joyces story as much as I have. It is a history that is, with in itself, unmatched in uniqueness by any other and I whole heartedly recommend it to the biography shy.	2001-05-26

My cousin told me it was very dissapointing, and I was ready for the worst, but it was suprisingly good. Some of it is perhaps far fetched, but it isn't at all as bad as I was expecting.<br /> Personally, I didn't really like Jacens personality. He seemed a little wimpy, or Something. That, to me at least, was a little dissapointing because I've always liked Jacen. He wasn't a total waste though, and I did enjoy many of his parts. Jaina, however, was done very well. She's always been my favorite, so if I'm not giving a biast opinion, I'm sorry. She did some really cool flying, and after I warmed up to R. A. Salvatore's style of writing, I really enjoyed these scenes. <br />Even though Chewie died, I thought that on the whole, this was a pretty good book. The Yuzhan Vong are pretty gross, and my sister was asking me what kind of name is 'Yuzhan Vong', but Hey! It's Star Wars. They're from another universe. They have to be different to make this a good book. And it is.	2000-10-31

Michael Stackpole is one of my favorite authors, and I really enjoyed this book. I think he has this one under his thumb. It was really excellent. The Yuzhan Vong are still here, menacing and scary, but they Are all that they are played up to be. <br />  I started to get a little more enthusiastic about Anikan, who, I don't mean this in a BAD way, I have always considered somewhat of a brat. I actually like him, and I enjoyed Jacen more too. I really like this book a lot better than Vector Prime, although that was a very good book too. Corran Horn is brought into perspective well, as only Stackpole can do, and Jaina makes it into Rogue Squadron, which is just too cool. Mara Jade is back into it, trying to overcome her disease, and Luke and Mara's marriage is the real thing. The opinion of Borsk Felya, Chief of State, doesn't change. He is still the political weasel he was before, and you can't feel anything but respect for Admiral Kre'Fey, his cousin. <br />I really liked this book. It isn't my favorite Star Wars book, and it probably isn't Michael A Stackpoles best book either, but it was Definately worth reading. I'm just not sure if it's a four star or a five star.	2000-10-31

For some reason I was convinced that it was going to be the worst one, and I put it off to read  last, but after I read it, I was charmed. This was my favorite book, tied  with only one other. This historical fiction is a work or art. It depicts  the bombing at Pearl Harbor well, showing how it changed so many lives. My  copy is bent from over reading. No one that has taken my advice to read it  has been dissapointed.   The predjudice against the Japanese-Americans  sparked by that bombing was really something that changed America. The main  character, Tomi, has to struggle through family problems, as well as broken  of friendships and tries to help hold onto any little bit of family  herritage left. The rewards of reading this book are large, and I really  appreciated it.	2000-09-18

Although it's first in the series, I  read it second, but I enjoyed it just as much. The characters are so funny,  and the story is well written. Jacques' style really comes out in his  books, this book especially. Charming, this is a story that includes  amazing friendships during the hardships of war. The beauty lies in the  plot development, showing how true fantasy should be written. I enjoyed the  different characters and trying to realate all of the peronalities to my  life and people I know. I was really excited when I read this book, and I  got up early in the morning and went to bed late, reading as fast as I  could in those brief hours before I had to start doing the days things or  get to sleep. I'm not embarrassed to say I enjoyed it. Through out the sad  parts and the glorious parts, the parts where certain characters showed  really bravery (like Matthais, my favorite), and the parts where I just  wanted to jump in and help, I felt like a proud parent (in a good way I  mean), or rather an amazed bystander, watching as the characters grew to  have more meaning. I really appreciate all of the work that Mr. Jacques put  into writting these, and I know I will continue to enjoy it repeatedly.	2000-09-18

After a while, I find that time-travel stories tend to be simialar, but this is one  I really enjoyed. After I read it, I gave it to my sister, and I know she  enjoyed it just as much as I did. After that we started over.

This is another of those books I happened to stumble upon as the result of faithful years of being in Battle of the Books. My friends tried to  describe it too me, but I just thought it sounded like the weirdest books  in the world, but since I didn't have a choice, I read it. I enjoyed it  immensly. The vivid descriptions are cool, the vocabulary good, and a book  like no others. Science Fiction is my favorite genre, and this is one of  the best science fiction books. I really don't want to give anything away,  but I'll tell you that it's as exotic and beautiful as the cover, with just  as many mysteries. I would read this one if you enjoy science fiction, and  even if you don't.	2000-09-18

But after I started going, I couldn't stop! I probably would have never have  read it, but it appeared on the Battle of the Books list for 7th/8th grade  battle of the books, so I didn't have a choice. Incredibly descriptive,  this is one of the best of the Redwall books. Trying to figure out the  riddles before the characters was entertaining, not that I did all that  well, and the character development was interesting. At the beginning,  there were too many characters for me to handle, of course I had never read  a Redwall book before at that time, but by the end, I could tell you about  each and every character. This story beautifully addresses greed and the  ability some find to abuse power. If some one were hesitant about starting  the series at the begging, although this one is a ways after, it's a good  place to start.	2000-09-18

Very well written, Krauker describes his summit of Everst in the disaster  of '96. Although I can see the Alaska Range from my house, and on clear  days I can see McKinley, I never considered climbing one.<br />From page one,  you are taken along the treacherous journey, to discover the thrills,  horrors, and secrets of Everest. After reading this, you definetly have to  sit down and think. As Krauker describes the members of his expedition, as  well as others, you get the feeling that you are meeting the people who  went up personally.

I haven't finished the series yet, but it's my favorite so far. This one  kept me up late many nights (between school, and other things this tends to  be the only time I have to read), waiting for my sister to fall asleep so  that I could hall out the old flash light.     The plot twists are carried  through well, the story interesting, making it a definite page turner.  Tycho Celchu goes on trial for the murder of Corran Horn while Rogue  Squadron is sent to take bacta for Warlord Zisinj. The Krytos plague is  threatening to destroy the Rebel Alliance. The death of Corran has  definetly hurt some people. What they don't know that you do is that Issard  has taken him to Lusankya, a place that no one knows much about. And  meanwhile, the spy in Rogue Squadron continues to sabatage. <br /> Carefully,  but well deliverd, this book keeps you on your toes, or rather your  fingertips. Although the battle scenes are few, it is wholey satisfying,  bringing you to the end with sorrow over the book gone by. After I finished  I layed in bed smiling at the ceiling, and I still go back to read the best  parts. This is one of my favorite Star Wars books.	2000-09-17

It is written with skill, showing that the author knows what he is  talking about. John Morton takes you to the Olympics showing exactly what  it's all about. Just as the title says, an insider unveils the agony and  the ecstasy of the Olympic dream. The skiing scenes are exciting, and it  depicts skiing well. As a skiier, I really liked this book, and I know lots  of other people who did too!<br /> A young man named Matthew Johnson driven by  the memory of his fathers dream of making a medal at the olympics, trains  extensively, and is able to make the olympic team. He has his good races  and the bad, while trying to console his mother who is home with a sister  that seems unable to stay out of trouble.

My parents had tried to show it to me when I was younger, but I just didn't get it. Then I saw  them in third grade and I liked it a lot. That year we went on a vacation,  so my mom bought this one for me to read on the airplane. I tried to get  into it a couple of times, but I never got very far. I just couldn't  understand it. I really tried though, and after those first two or three  pages I fell in love with it. Now, of course, I understand it perfectly, I  just didn't know enough about Star Wars then to get it. I never would have  really gotten in to Star Wars (well I don't actually know that, but) if I  hadn't read it. I couldn't put it down and read it rapidly. All I talked  about the rest of the trip was my book and how good it was, and when I got  home I bought the next one, and so started my Star Wars craze.	2000-08-19

This was a good one too, but it was my least favorite of the series. Actually, that's kind of funny because it's one of my best friends  favorite, but that's not the point. There wasn't as much action at this  point, and to me I didn't like the fact that Zekk was a traitor, because I  have always thought he was way cool.

When I realized that it was from the point of view of the  Zhurzh, I started to have doubts, but it turned out to be just as good as  the first. Vivid, and emotional, you find yourself feeling the way the  characters do, hoping that things will turn out for them. This book  compelled me to read the third.	2000-08-04

I usually do not like Si-Fi but when this book was introduced to our class, we fell in love with it. We, especially me, were enchanted by the writing style of the author  and the plot that was unraveled as we met our thirst for more. It kept you  wanting to go back for more.<br />This is written by three people, I  pertaining to all of them. They are Megan Deremer, Olivia Karns, and  Brittany Karns. They are all very good friends and loved this book.	2000-08-01

I have read it four times, and parts of it. I did a report on it in 6th grade, and I got an A. I really enjoyed it. Who wouldn't? It has a plot, and at the  end it resembles the better Cinderella that you always hoped was there. I  absolutely fell in love with Ella, and through all of her bad times I felt  the want she had for something better. I remember the night I first  finished it, I layed in bed smiling at the ceiling, thinking about it and  thinking about it over and over. At the end the worst possible happens, but  she comes out ontop in a beautiful story. I felt so happy for her, because  after all of her trials and all of her hard work, she finally gets what she  wants.	2000-08-01

It kept me captivated from the minute I started to the minute I finished. I thought this story was beautiful, showing emotions and feelings well, and describing things that were so real  to life. This summer I was fortunate enough to travel to Europe and I got  to pick to books to take, so I bought Snow Falling on Cedars, and every  time we got in the van my book was out, all the way untill we finished it.  I loved it. A lot of people tell me that I'm just too soft, but it made me  cry. I wish I could meet David Guterson because he must be a very  interesting person. Ishmael was my favorite, the way intended, and I wish  there was some way he could marry Hatsue or something. I learned a lot of  history I didn't know. When I hear about World War 2, I think of the  Holocaust or events over seas. I have studied it a lot, and I never even  thought about what was going on to the Japanese in America much. This book  really piqued my interest, and I loved the book. I found it down to Earth,  and though there were a few explicit scenes, it was thoroghly enjoyable. I  would definately recomend it.	2000-08-01

I read it on recommendation of a friend, and all I could do after I started was read. I liked it a lot. After I finished I just kept going back and reading over some of the best parts, over and over. It was really good! <br />The story is about a teenager named Arden  who lives with her brother. Both of her parents died when she was young, so  he takes care of her. One day he gets in a snow machineing accident, which  really scares him. A week later when his snow machine, and other things are  found in the river, she knows he is dead. Or is he? No one beleives her,  thinking it's brought on by depression, as she starts to search for her  missing brother. This book was captivating, a story like no other.

At the beggining I was a little apprehensive because it didn't sound very good, but after the first chapter or two I had a keen interest for the story that  was unfolding. This theif is able to out whitt everyone, and although he  seems to have the biggest disadvantage of everyone, he manages to pull it  off with suprising turns at the end.	2000-07-31

It is an awesomely fitting conclusion to Specter of the Past, making Star Wars anything you would hope it could be. I think this is my favorite Star Wars book, coming before just  a few others. This is such a fantastic book! There are many plots in one.  Plus, <br />    LUKE AND MARA ARE GETTING MARRIED! <br />The  galaxy is still torn up over the Camas Document, bringing war closer and  closer to a reallity.

After I read this one I had to read all of the other ones in the series, and I wish there were more. My friends say this is exactly like me because his style  describes me so well, but who can't resist it?<br />In this book, you will  learn the basics for hitchhiking through the galaxy. Bring your towel and  travel with Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect when they have to hitch a ride  with Volgans to get off of Earth before it is demolished for a galaxy  bypass. This small Guide to the galaxy, wiht it's reassuring, Don't Panic,  is so cool you want it. As you meet more characters like AWESOME Zaphod  Beelbrox, Trillion (she's way cool), and Marvin (I think he's funny, no  matter how annoying they find him) you become drawn into the story and have  to finish the series.	2000-07-31

Every night found my self in bed wondering what was going to happen to each different character, with their own situation and circumstances. During the day I just wanted time to read more . . .  very good!  Another of Timothy Zahns best! <br />This book is about a family  who is concerned over the death of their brother. While the rest of the  human race is trying to prepare for war with a seemingly deadly race who  they termed the Conquerors, they are planing a rescue mission for the  brother they think may still be out there. You get the views from the  brother who is captured (and thought to be dead), ones from the father,  Lord Cavanagh, from the brother Aric who is actually on the small rescue  missions boarding party, and from the sister who is stuck on a planet that  is being invaded.       There are a lot of clever twists in this story.  Zahn cleverly adds in Humans past, bringing you into the future where they  are currently. This history includes a super weapon called CIRCE, so  powerful it destroyed a race. Although disassembled, it remains a threat  and also keeps the peace.       In this book are many interesting plots and  twists, making a thoroghly enjoyable book and pushing you to read the next  one.                  READ IT ! ! ! !	2000-07-31
