The tapes introduce concepts and vocabulary in an orderly, easy to understand manner.  The workbook allows you to follow along with the tapes, or to read aloud for practice.  In the margins of each short chapter, it defines words you may not have learned.  Finally, there is a brief but concise 1 page &quot;test&quot; at the end of each chapter to help you evaluate your progress.<br />Good luck with your French!	2003-01-02

It's pocket-sized, yet it doesn't feel overly abridged.  There are handy helps in the back for talking about the time and converting weights, measures, and temperatures.  If you're thinking of reading a novel in French or translating some poetry, though, you'll need a more substantial volume!	2003-01-01

Since it had 4cd's, 2 books and a dictionary, I assumed that it would be a great help to me in learning some Italian.  But it wasn't.  The presentation is not particularly orderly or succinct, and an entire section early on is devoted to how to say absurdly complicated things like &quot;I'm married, but my partner has just left me with our children&quot;.  And what I really wanted to learn was simply how to buy tickets, order food, and hold brief, polite conversations.<br />If you'd like to get started learning Italian, I'd recommend Berlitz's &quot;Rush Hour Italian&quot; which does a good job of going over the basics and helping you remember them.	2002-12-31

It has interesting bits of advice from recent graduates of first tier schools, and also offers a good honest look at what law school will really be like once you get in.  Best of all, though, is the way it slows readers down and guides them through the important questions they need to ask themselves in order to know if they ought to apply to law school.	2002-12-31

Borges' imagination is dazzling, and he delights in lulling readers with droll academic details before springing an unexpected surprise on us.  <br />On the down side, once you become accustomed to his style, you may grow impatient with it.  Some of the stories may feel formulaic, but it's hard to fault these weaknesses when you consider that this book contains nearly his entire life's work of short stories.  Some are bound to be better, and you should buy this book and read it for them.	2002-12-31

On the inside covers are charts that rate recent vintages.  The book begins with discussions of the important winegrowing regions and brief analyses of the most recent harvests in each of them.  But the main reason to buy this little gem is its main section, an alphabetically organised trove of information which not only offers opinions about thousands of winemakers, but also slips in informative tidbits about many grape varieties (not just the famous ones), and growing regions.  A great guide for anyone who's interested in wine, especially those who want more than just the basics!  <BR>   If you are looking for a first book on wine, Oz's &quot;Introducing Wine&quot; might be a better choice - it offers much of the same information in a more user-friendly format with larger pages and print, as well as great pictures.	2002-12-27

As you would expect, the Complete Works contains all of Donne's well-known poems.  Many of these and several of his lesser known pieces are absolutely brilliant works. But there are reasons why all of Donne's habeas corpus  isn't wildly popular, and the Complete Works allows you to find those  reasons for yourself.  If you really want to study Donne, by all means buy  this.  If you're looking for old favorites, a book of selections will spare  your wallet, shelf, and time.	2000-05-05

While the film version of Trainspotting presents a rather slick, humorous version of Mark Renton's life with the needle, the book devotes perhaps a third of itself to a more realistic one.  For example, Diane has no  condoms, and Renton is raped while he's passed out by a dirty, neurotic  man.  Its scope is much larger than the film's, encompassing perhaps three  times the number of significant characters, and weaving their stories  together in a way that keeps the reader feeling as confused as nauseous.  I  liked it on the whole, but too much of it felt disjointed and irrelevant  for me to really enjoy it.	1999-12-03

Instead, he sowed his general narrative with humorous details and vivid, entertaining stories  that bring the values and attitudes of his time to life.  This is one of  the most enjoyable of the Greek classics.	1999-12-03

Far From the Madding crowd is filled with the heartwrenching depiction of humanity that Thomas Hardy created so well, but unlike most of his other significant works it also has a satisfying ending a la Jane Austen.  Perhaps it isn't his MOST perfect work, but it's definately the pleasantest  to swallow.	1999-12-01

Tess of the D'Urbervilles is an intensely depressing but brilliant depiction of the connections between love, fear, and guilt.  The vivid clarity with which Hardy draws Tess as a vulnerable innocent struggling,  and ultimately failing to come to terms with the merciless world makes this  a masterpiece.	1999-12-01

While I enjoyed the book and the idea, Calvino's description of how he was inspired to  write in this way makes it seem that he merely came up with a neat idea and  quickly executed it - without much deliberation.  I wanted to feel that the  book was more than the result of an intellegent, charming writer's Sunday  afternoon.	1999-11-30

Its characters are vividly detailed and intensely amusing, yet Gogol spends the novel tempting the reader to peer behind the slapstick humor of the story and see  something far more significant and sinister.  I've bought the book for  several friends and am reading it for the second time myself.  The  Pevear-Volokhonsky translation is best - it contains helpful, well written  notes and uses words like 'snookums' to bring home the endearing hilarity  of the original.	1999-11-30

It isn't a worthless book, but your time would definately be better spent reading one  of the famous Lawrence books - this is clearly the creation of a young,  impressionable mind.  For instance, Lawrence makes constant reference to  Wagner's 'Ring' in the book, rubbing the reader's nose profusely in  heavyhanded hints that Siemund is borrowed from the German composer's work.	1999-11-30

The story that the book tells is in a way horrible, but I found myself unwilling to close the book and forget about it. Nearly every event in the book is so horrifyingly plausible that I find myself thinking that perhaps Zola was the true creator of the dark world known (undeservedly?) as Greeneland. Perhaps most importantly, however, this book gave me the experience of the suppressed that teachers failed to achieve in high school when we read The Grapes of Wrath and The Jungle.	1999-07-10

Not only does it provide a fascinating glimpse of life a thousand years ago, but the somewhat formal tone and the earthy subjects discussed make the book very humourous. Beside the classic fights of all epics, Njal's Saga contains a court case. I cannot reccommend it enough.	1999-05-08

I cannot give it a 5, however, because I've also read La Porte Etroite, which I thought was a great deal better. In the Immoralist, Michel is largely the father of the tragedy that  rips his life apart; in La Porte Etroite, the disintegration begins from  outside the narrator. Michel's feelings are often hidden behind the veil of  his actions, making it hard to perceive his true desires and intentions  (which even he may not fully grasp). Overall, a good read, but maybe not  the best introduction to Gide.	1998-12-09

This is not Heinrich Boll's best book, but it is certainly well worth reading. The story centers around a court case, in which a man and his father are being tried for burning an army jeep. The case is kept very  low-profile, and the accuseds are not concerned at all by the charges,  which seem suspiciously minor. Boll's finely drawn characters and dialogue  make the story eminently palatable, as he asks the reader subtle questions  about art and its place in the state.	1998-11-24

I read 'Night' by Elie Wiesel, and although I sensed the horror of the Holocaust, I didn't actually feel it. Some time later I read 'Life with a Star', and finally felt it, deep inside. This book is an incredible  description of a Jew's life outside the camps during the war. I highly  recommend it.	1998-11-24

Don't mistake the 'enlightenment' for a Siddharthaesque plot. This book is not written in the  detached style that Siddhartha is. Hrabal's writing is warm, sensitive, and  alluring - as is the book's main character. From the Paradise brothel to an  old hut in the woods, the main character's search for contentment is  sincere. And that may be what makes the book so believeable.	1998-11-14

He runs about photographing them, wondering whether the victims' genitalia were injured  and masturbating at crash safety tests. As the book progressed, I found it  harder and harder to believe in the doctor's obsessions - and in his desire  to die.     Admittedly, those factors do not make the book bad art, they  merely make it repellent. Crash is not an entirely worthless book. It  addresses a number of issues significant to present-day society. If you're  looking for a masterpiece about sex and death, though, don't believe the  hype on the cover. Look elsewhere.	1998-11-14

What you do  see, again and again, is the cruel light of daily life burning up the  revolutionary ideals of the &quot;new&quot; Communist Russia. Platonov  makes clear just how destructive the ideology of the times could become if  left unchecked. The book is peopled with soulless men, wandering about  attempting to improve the lot of the next generation in utterly futile  ways. A very harsh, hard read, The Foundation Pit is a fascinating account  of the Russian people's souls under Communism.	1998-10-25

Most of it is devoted to Kharms'  short stories, which are not only often hilarious, but well written. Of  course, on a more intellectual level, absurdism is suggesting the futility  and humor of typical life. So the book can be enjoyed as an introduction to  absurdism, a funny read, and a collection of philosophic short stories. I  really can't reccomend this highly enough, particularly to readers who've  never experienced absurdism.	1998-10-25

A Potrait of the Artist as a Young Man is worth reading if you read books  often. If you don't, your time might be spent to better ends on another  book, because it is not particularly interesting or stimulating if you  aren't already fascinated by Joyce's writing. Nonetheless, it IS a very  famous and well-regarded book and you may want to read it because of this.	1998-10-21

My only quarrel  with the book was that it seemed rather forced towards the end. This might  be my faulty reading of it, or it may be the way the book was written, but  it seems only honest to mention it. Nonetheless, it's a very fanciful book,  brimming with expectation and freedom, and definately worth reading.	1998-10-14
