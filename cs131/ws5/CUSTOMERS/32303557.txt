Books	5	2	3	N	N	Thoughtful	This is a thought provoking book and its written to those that aren't Christian or haven't taken action in the Christian faith. It explores the concept of God, the supernatural, &amp; how it applies to our life and culture. It's not preachy, its written in such a way that it makes you think while still being easy to read. There are three parts to the book: What are we missing?, signs of disorder, two worlds.	2003-11-29

Is there a higher power, and is that higher power God? These are all the questions that we ask and wonder about. There are many answers and philosophers including Plato himself, have tried to answer these questions. <br />The Purpose-Driven life gives answers and talks about the meaning of life for every human being, from the Christian perspective. And I must say that the author did a very good job on it, no wonder its been a best seller for weeks. Right from the beginning the author writes as if he's talking to the reader, as if its some kind of personal conversation between friends. <br />You don't have to be a scholar or to have grown up in the church to understand this book. That's what I liked about it, anyone can understand what the author is saying. This is unlike any book that I've read. Its about life and people's purpose from a Christian perspective. I'd definately reccomend it, whether your Christian or not. No matter how mature you are as a Christian, you'll definately get something out of this book. <br />Sure the thing doesn't talk about everything that's relevant to the Christian faith but just talks about the basics. It would be useful to have a handy Bible by your side as you read this, I prefer the Message Bible since its easy to read and is written in 21st Century language.	2003-11-29
US	32303557	RHT4AKQ2I40B5	0849942713	723070327	The Visitation	Books	5	4	4	N	N	great	This book starts off a bit slow but it gets very good towards the end. As always, Frank Peretti's books deal with good vs. evil. God vs. Satan, angels vs. demons. His books are written smartly and they avoid cheesy Christian cliches. This time around, Frank Peretti decides not to give the reader a background view of angels vs. demons like in \\"This Present Darkness\\" and \\"Piercing the Darkness\\" series.<br />This time we only see the point of view from the human characters. Although its still a battle of good vs. evil.<br />The book focuses mainly on one character, Travis Jordan. He's resigned as pastor and he's kind of in a rut. Suddenly, a few strangers come into their small town. One in particular is Brandon Nichols, who performs miracles and healings and leads people to believe that he's Jesus Christ.<br />Other strange things include weeping crucifixes, and people acting out as if their characters from the Bible. Lots of weird stuff is happening. Most of the people in town are buying Brandon Nichols's act, and strangers from all over the country are visiting the small town.<br />But to a select few something is just not right. They don't really believe that Brandon is Jesus. Kyle is the first one to say that he's not fooled and that Brandon's power comes from demons.<br />Something has to be done to expose Brandon and to save their town from a lunatic. So Travis, Kyle and Morgan team up to find out who Brandon really is, and its quite a mystery as the book flashes back to Travis's history with his faith and in the church.<br />A lot of stuff here is exposed about the church that usually isn't discussed, and I like that honesty. Frank Peretti has written another great novel, although its much more slow paced.<br />There is some heavy violence towards the end in this novel, its revealed that a character has been \\"crucified\\" and no I'm not talking about Jesus. I would recommend it for older teens and adults. I really liked the conclusion of this book, its well written and Peretti is very imaginative. The book is funny, other times sad, and sometimes romantic while still avoiding the cheesiness factor.written and Peretti is very imaginative.

I can't believe at all the useful advice that I got from this book. Not every tip worked for me, but that's okay, because a lot of her advice was just so helpful and I used a lot of it. <br />The book is about 247 pages and has four sections: home, body, eat & drink, wear. This book is a must for any city girl on a budget. Learn how to decorate for less, take care of plants and flowers, work out & take care of skin, hair and make-up without breaking the bank. Save on clothes, entertain for less, and much more. <br />The only drawback is that it doesn't have a section on how to save on entertainment.

I, normally can't get into these wacky character chick books, but Sophie Kinsella, has done a great job with the character of Rebecca Bloomwood. I've read the first two books in the series, liked them and just got finished reading this new book. If Sophie Kinsella, has another Shopaholic book in the works, then that'd be so cool. I can't wait.<br />Rebecca Bloomwood has finally settled in NYC. She's one of the best personal shoppers at Barneys, she's got great friends, and things are going well with her live-in boyfriend Luke. Her best friend from England, Suze is getting married and Rebecca is invited to the wedding. Which has got Becky thinking of wedding rings and such things. Becky tries to play it cool but she's ecstatic when Luke finally proposes. <br />Her mom soon dives deep in wedding plans in England, and her cold mother-in-law Elinor is planning a huge wedding at the Plaza Hotel. Rebecca can't say no to either wedding! So the wedding plans go on for both weddings on two different countries, the good ol' U.S.A. and England! Time is ticking fast and its time for Becky to decided which wedding she wants. <br />Will our favorite Shopaholic be able to tie the knot? How will she pull it off? You're going to have to read the book to find out, 'cause its so hilarious. This book is indeed the best of the series, it was so funny. The novel plays out like a wacky Hollywood comedy. <br />The only thing that I didn't like was that Suze was marrying her cousin Tarquin! I mean think of the kids! That's just really weird. <br />She's also got the funniest shopping habits! Its a must read for anyone that's a fan of the series, I hope that Sophie Kinsella writes a fourth Shopaholic book. It was also cool seeing Luke solve his mother issues, and the characters do grow in this book.	2003-07-04

It avoids the usual Christian cliches and explores the concept of God. Its aimed at teens in high school, but I'm a college student and I felt that this book could be for anyone despite their age. It helped me understand a lot of things much better even though I've heard of them before. <br />This book talks about who God is, and what he does. It helps explain the trinity, suffering and how it all affects you. Again, this is written from a Christian perspective and I really liked this book. <br />It doesn't have the usual Christian cliches, it doesn't sound boring and I highly recommend it for anyone that wants to understand the concept of God much better from a Christian perspective.

Like other dating books it covers common sense advice like &quot;avoid dating a non Christian, be mature in your relationship with Christ before entering a romantic relationship.&quot; etc. <br />The author presents charts throughout the book on how a romantic relationship should follow. No offense but there is no such thing as a formulaic way to go about relationships, and its ridiculous to actually think that dating is a sin or &quot;disease.&quot; <br />Yes, I agree there are a lot of problems in dating but its not like &quot;courting&quot; is more holy or more safe. There will be problems with romantic relationships no matter what they want to call it. So while I agree there is a lot of smart advice in this book, I wouldn't recommend it. <br />Life doesn't follow formulas and charts. There are better books out there like &quot;Boundaries in Dating&quot; and &quot;When God Writes Your Love Story.&quot; I liked them a whole lot better than this book.	2003-05-27

It goes beyond the \\"save sex for marriage\\" message. We've all heard why we should save sex for marriage, and this book goes beyond that. The book is inspiring whether you are a virgin or have had sex before. You can start over and see why sex for marriage is truly worth waiting for. <br />This book will explain why the \\"Sex and the City\\" philosophy of sex doesn't work in the real world, and why God's way of sex works best.

No, not every bit of advice that was given works for me but nonetheless I did get a lot out of this book. A lot of the advice is common sense and other stuff is like \\"why didn't I think of this myself?\\"<br />There are five sections that include: entertainment, relationships, personal improvement, home improvement, and money. Its a good basic guide for anyone that's looking to save without cramping your style. The authors write with wit and humor.<br />The book is small, pocket book style. My only complaint is that the section on how to make cheap costumes was bad. There are ways to make low cost costumes and they don't have to be lame. That's my only complaint and its a good book overall. I also recommend \\"City Chic: An Urban Girl's Guide to Livin' Large on Less by Nina Willdorf\\"	2003-05-24

I'm a fan of his Xanth series, so naturally I felt compelled to pick up this book. <br />Penn & Chandelle are grandparents of a wild teenage girl, so they rent a house where they could spend some time with their granddaughter. The house is quite unusual. <br />The backdoor opens up to different worlds, the house is conscious and stocks itself with stuff that Penn & Chandelle like. Everything from food, clothing, hobbies, interests, tv, internet, anything that they need and want. <br />There is a holographic window that changes setting, and the house can \\"travel\\" to different locations in the world.<br />Soon their wild granddaughter Lynn joins them, along with her cousin Lloyd and his dob Obsidian. Penn, Chandelle, Lynn, Lloyd & Obsidian are soon discovering the house's many secrets and mysteries...<br />What's the house for? What does it want from its occupants? Well I sure am not going to tell you, your going to have to read to find out. I really liked how Piers Anthony weaved the story. He doesn't give anything away and the house's purpose is revealed in the last pages. <br />This book is somewhat risque with sex references, its not dirty but its somewhat risque. Kinda like when movies have sexual jokes, references, etc. Like the cousin Lloyd is a little lustful for his cousin since he's almost a teenager but that is no excuse...and Lynn flashes him...if you know what I mean.<br />Later on they take in some strangers and there is this girl who is many years older, but she's definately an adult. Anyway this girl was looking for a job, she was lied to and then taken into white slavery, the house & the others eventually find her & help her escape. <br />Lloyd develops a crush on her and then the other characters agree it would be okay if she was with Lloyd in an intimate way because she has no passport, no papers, & no identity. She can't return to her city because where she comes from its considered a cultural disgrace, even if it was not the girl's fault that she ended up in white slavery. <br />That was so sad to read but still I don't think that the characters should have agreed that it would be okay if she was intimate with Lloyd, after all he's a minor!! <br />I only recommend it for older teens & adults but its not something that I would read again, I think that Piers Anthony went too far in this book with the sexual risque situations.	2003-05-18

Well I actually have a life. And some of the advice makes sense i.e. \\"don't open up too fast, don't mention marriage on the first date, dress nice & look attractive.\\"<br />It sounds pretty good, but its common sense. A lot of it seems manipulative & just silly i.e. \\"don't see him more than once or twice a week, don't accept a sat. night date after wed., don't discuss the rules with your therapist.\\" <br />Not everyone finds love by going through the rules, if you've got common sense and a good head on your shoulders, then you'll do fine without the rules. The authors also imply that if you don't follow the rules then you won't end up married or in a committed relationship. <br />Halfway through it feels as if the authors were trying to manipulate the reader by giving advice like \\"don't discuss the rules with your family, friends, and therapist.\\" Ideas are meant to be challenged, and if they were so sure on their Rules then they wouldn't feel threatened if the reader told her loved ones. Besides family & friends are there to help not hurt and give advice. <br />They act as if by using the rules you'll end up with a man. Nothing is 100% guaranteed, I don't care how good it sounds. You might end up being pursued by the wrong guy, hey its happened. Bad boys love a challenge too, and playing hard to get might actually end up hurting you. Guys might think that your just trying to be polite when you talk to them and move on.  <br />The authors need to get real. I know plenty of people that used their common sense & were smart in dating and are married without following the rules. BTW, I don't like to follow advice from authors that have no success in relationships. <br />I read in a newspaper article that one of them got a divorce, not exactly the type of person that's qualified to give advice on relationships. Nothing personal, I'd just rather get advice from an author that has succeeded in that area. Save your money ladies, and check it out from your library first.	2003-05-18

Bring Jesus into the 21st Century, and I really liked that. It was cool &amp; interesting to see what Jesus might have been like if He had come in our time. So that was cool. <br />But I also found it a little confusing. The main character Conrad gets in a car wreck, &amp; is in a coma. At the same time, his mind is in another parallel universe. I just think that was really odd. I would have like to have seen the character come back to his own universe and alive, mind and body. <br />The author also doesn't go into much detail about why the character was thrown into this parallel world. <br />In one scene, Conrad calls Eli &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;, and then in another Eli acknowledges that he knows about the other world &amp; Eli says that He created the parallel universes. That wasn't enough for me, I would have liked to have known more. It should have been more detailed. Its just weird.<br />The flashbacks that his daughter Julia had about their estranged relationship, was annoying. The dialogue just kept repeating itself, and it was done too many times thoroughout the book. I don't mean no offense, but I just felt like the drama could've been much better, and the parallel universe could've been much better. I wish that the whole book had been written much better.	2003-05-08

However that's not to say that it wasn't good, because it was a really great book. <br />I liked that it had a contemporary feel to it, with strong and developed characters. It avoided the Christian sementalities and cliches, so it was refreshing to read. Not the best but its pretty good. It has a positive message, while being warm, and chaste. <br />Many female writers in Christian fiction tend to write with such sentimentality and predictability so much so that it makes me want to gag. Besides a lot of books tend to be about the &quot;schoolmarm heads out west type,&quot; which I don't like. Thank goodness for Dee Henderson and for her portrayal of a strong but loving female character in this book. I read this prequel because I want to start reading the O'Malley series.	2003-04-11

There's also an episode guide in the end, for seasons 1,2, and 3. It's a fun glossie and fans of the trading show will probably like it. But a decorating book? Its not. <br />For all you designer wannabes and fans, there are two more books coming out this upcoming August 2003 that'll focus more on decorating, and how to make decorating magic happen at home.	2003-04-04

That's to be expected in any dating/courting book, but this one is different. Instead of focusing on the hunt for \\"the one,\\" we should be focusing on God, our lives, and becoming the right people in order to marry the right person. <br />The author avoids formulas, cliches, and legalistic rules. He puts things in a new perspective and brings different views to old ideas. He doesn't try to sugar coat anything and he tells it like it is.<br />There are four parts and here's what it covers:<br />Part 1: Building a Solid Foundation for Relationships<br />Chapter 1: \\"All I wanna do is have some fun\\"<BR>Chapter 2: Becoming a person worth knowing and marrying<BR>Chapter 3: Recognizing a person worth knowing and marrying<BR>Chapter 4*: Kissing Dumb Dating Goodbye<br />*in chapter 4, the author talks about the difference between smart dating and dumb dating. And that there's nothing wrong with dating a great and decent person.<br />Part 2: Facing the Sobering Realities about relationships and Marriage<br />Chapter 5: Before you tie the knot, make sure the rope isn't around your neck<BR>Chapter 6: 12 lousy reason for getting married<BR>Chapter 7: 12 problem people to avoid<br />Part 3: Recognizing the right match for a good marriage<br />Chapter 8: The best reasons for getting married<BR>Chapter 9: 12 things to be sure of before you get married<BR>Chapter 10: 10 ways to know you've found \\"The One.\\"<br />Part 4: Life right now<br />Chapter 11: Celebrating singleness<BR>Chapter 12: Dealing with sex<br />I found this book to be quite refreshing from other books on dating/courting. Instead of trying to convince you that courting is more holy, or that dating is dirty, he takes a different approach on dating, friendship, and romance. He doesn't try to talk anyone down and its appropriate for teens and even people in their 20s. <br />I've read a lot of dating/courting books everything from I Kissed Dating Goodbye, Boy Meets Girl, Choosing God's Best, When God Writes Your Love Story, Passion & Purity, etc.<br />This book and WGWYLS(When God Writes Your Love Story) have got to be the best books around on dating, in my opinion anyway. I'd definately recommend it.	2003-04-02

You'll see Jane date, but not that much, see her dealing with her family, her peers, and even with a childhood enemy who she befriends. It could have been better written but I liked it. I could really relate to Jane and I don't understand all the negative reviews. Come on, you've got to admit that she's more real than those other Bridget Jones [types]. It was fun reading about a heroine that I could relate to. It's a light and fun read, take it with you to the beach!	2003-03-31

I've been reading the Love Inspired series for a short time now and they've become my favorite books to read. Not all of them are great, but a lot of them are and this one turned out to be a gem. <br />Rachel Peters is a famous chef who's always on the move and is called to the small town of Magnolia Blossom after her aunt's death. Its up to Rachel now to take care of her siblings, brother Shaun and her sister Amy. But its not as easy as Rachel thought it would be, her siblings resent her, especially Amy, who won't listen to anything Rachel says. On top of all that, she must face her high school sweetheart Michael Hunter who's also a single parent. Michael offers to help Rachel with Shaun and Amy, and in the process the two begin to fall in love. <br />It's predictable but I loved it.	2003-03-30
US	32303557	R3QTJ754UI9VW8	059521293X	73236756	Revelations, Alpha and Omega	Books	1	2	4	N	N	don't be fooled	The author claims that most of life's mysterious questions about God and life are in his novel but don't be fooled. Sure a lot of facts here and storylines are based from the Bible, but a lot of them aren't. A lot of the storylines and ideas that the author incorporates are from writings or \\"lost books\\" that weren't included into the Bible but are still around. So you have a lot of half-truth's in here and a lot of wrong truths. If you want to see what some of those lost books are, go to carm.org ( a Christian based site that talks about such issues.) <br />Please don't be fooled, this author has a lot of half-truths and lies, written into his book, he thinks he's got the answers but he doesn't. He thinks what he's written is the truth but if you really know your bible and study it then you realize that he doesn't. <br />The book basically takes you from the beginning to the end of time and history, and halfway through I just lost interest. It could have been better written, and the character development wasn't that great. Some of what he wrote was just disturbing. Don't take it seriously, and btw, the screenplay format was all right but it was also distracting. Don't waste your money.<br />Sure there will always be a lot of unanswered questions in life like how did they build those pyramids, etc. But a lot of life's important questions can be found in the Bible, after all that's what its there for, look in there for life's questions and not into a novel.	2003-03-30

Not from the law, but from her past. Will she be able to slow down and live life peacefully with the guy she's fallen for? Well you can find out by reading the book, and even though the book is very small and predictable, I liked it. The book is very contemporary and avoids cliches.	2003-03-27
US	32303557	R3KC131BNWGQYY	0373872038	975110776	Her Perfect Match (Laurel Glen, Book 4)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	very good	A lot of the Love Inspired books that I've read, felt cliched and out of touch with reality. It's a small book, dished out by Harlequin Publishing. Some of the books in their Love Inspired line (its specifically written for Christians) were a little too hokey. I'm sorry but not all Christians fit the \\"stereotype\\" that the world has of them. This book is contemporary, and the characters have to deal with real problems and issues. My only warning is that later on in the book, its revealed that the main character was raped as a teenager, but take heart since it later shows her getting help and going to counseling. The author makes the storyline work.<br />The book is about an heiress, who meets a young man at a friend's ranch who is looking for his past. The two don't get along at first (which is natural for most romantic books), but eventually fall in love. Family, love, life issues, friendship, this book is very good, and its well written. Its not another \\"fluff\\" romantic book.	2003-03-27
US	32303557	R14T9WKFP5Y778	0310205719	36906356	The Purpose Driven Life	Books	5	20	24	N	N	The meaning of life	What's the meaning of life? Why are we here? Is there an afterlife? Is there a higher power, and is that higher power God? These are all the questions that we ask and wonder about. There are many answers and philosophers including Plato himself, have tried to answer these questions. <br />A lot of them aren't very satisfactory. I think that most people got to admit that a lot of the answers dished out by the Bible are more complete and more satisfactory than any others can offer. Maybe that's why, its one of the reasons that ithe Bible continues to be a best seller. <br />The Purpose-Driven life gives answers and talks about the meaning of life for every human being, from the Christian perspective. And I must say that the author did a very good job on it, no wonder its been a best seller for weeks. Right from the beginning the author writes as if he's talking to the reader, as if its some kind of personal conversation between friends. <br />You don't have to be a scholar or to have grown up in the church to understand this book. That's what I liked about it, anyone can understand what the author is saying. <br />I've read quite a lot of secular self-help books, Christian self-help books, and Christian living books. This is really unlike any other Christian living book that I've read. It doesn't try to be a manual. Its about life and people's purpose from a Christian perspective. I'd definately reccomend it, whether your Christian or not. No matter how mature you are as a Christian, you'll definately get something out of this book.	2003-03-27

It's a book for the 20s something crowd, and the whole book is written in email format. Its hilarious, and I really liked the characters. It would have been very interesting if the author had done some chapters as a novel. Anyway, I only object to some sexual references that the author made.	2003-03-25
US	32303557	R17OFPEXPY1RP1	0373872046	913521532	Sweet Accord (Love Inspired #197)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	nice	This book is very well written, but it feels very cliched. The town that the main characters live in is so out of the ordinary. They live in a small town where most people get along with others, remember Mayberry from the Andy Griffith Show? That's how this town is. <br />On some levels its hard to relate to the characters, I think that this book is geared towards those raised in the church. If you weren't raised like that, & didn't have a story book life, this might not be appealing. <br />Although I liked reading it, well...I wished that the book was more contemporary. On the plus side, the book is well written, fun, and sentimental.	2003-03-22

I haven't been impressed by love inspired books until now. This books characters are warm, funny, and well developed without feeling cliched. I also liked the fact that this book has a contemporary feel. Brianne Walker is writer who makes her home in the Ozarks (Arkansas hills), and leads a quiet and peaceful life. It all changes one night when single dad Mitch Fowler and his two young sons seek refuge from a rainy storm. Soon Brianne finds herself falling in love not only with Mitch but with the entire family. This book is so hilarious, and I absolutely loved reading it. A must read!	2003-03-22
