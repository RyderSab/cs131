I admired her first heartshattering, atmospheric, and highly resonant tragic novel, \\"The Blue Place,\\" starring this same lead detective character. That novel has the palpable sense of impending doom and unavoidable, inevitable destiny from the very beginning and this wished-for follow-up of Aud's state of emotional and mental health is pure prose poetry of being in the state of grief. I could identify. The 'mystery' novel part of it is negligible, a McGuffin, it's not about that, just as the first novel really wasn't either. The dead lover is so present in her thoughts and heart that it almost reads like a ghost story at times. Aud is not a great detective by any means, but she is a woman of action.	2004-08-16
US	46092285	R83Q53Y0B1IUH	193151397X	584565739	Gulf Breeze	Books	5	11	12	N	N	The most gentle of ubers	I second that motion to make it a movie and what the reviewer below says about these newer novels (many of them ubers) making much better films than the vast majority of indies we see is SO true. The new 'gay cable channel' should definitely give the XWP ubers a look, so many of them have these same engaging characters, sparkling dialogue, delicious sexual situations, well developed backstory and well described backdrop, and humorous, often delightfully quirky, plotlines. These are the novels I wanted to be reading growing up. We have a lot for which to thank that fandom and the bards that came out swinging their quills. This delicate, amusing, romantic novel is an absolute charmer. Her sense of place is palpable, you can smell the salt air, hear the gulls, and feel sand under your feet as you read. The leads have frisson (a la classic romantic comedy) at first sight and keep denying and dancing around it in the most delightful fashion until they finally give in to the feelings. The naturalist backdrop of nature photography and bird sanctuary gives it all great color and nuance. Nothing really major happens, except the most major thing of all, two people meant for each other fall in love. This is such an endearing book I will always count it as one of my favorites.	2004-08-16

I don't believe it's ever been filmed and it would make such a wonderfully modern comedy of manners and sexual politics. Written in the 19th century and surprisingly nouveau. It is possibly my own personal favorite novel, I have several editions and have read it many times. A woman masquerades as a man, in the grand, Shakespearean classic tradition and finds herself drawn to both men and women as they to her. Much homosexual panic and confusion ensues, esp. for the man who finds this intriguing young 'boy' so fascinating. His lover, an older woman, is equally attracted to the disguised girl. Where will it all end? The french invented the menage afterall. Intricately written with lots of social satire and commentary. An interesting footnote: this is the book that Mary is reading in \\"The Children's Hr.\\" that 'inspires' her imagination which leads to her ratting out her teachers as lesbians.	2004-08-09

Along with all of the romance and relationship angst and suspense and a well relayed tactile sense for her setting (I would actually get cold at times while reading from her description of the environment) the thing I liked most about this novel was the presentation of an empathetic, funny, real, genuinely helpful shrink, if only they could all be as intelligent and insightful.	2004-08-06

That's quite a talent. This one is nothing like any of her others. It's sort of like a great Lifetime movie (producers take note!) which may sound like an oxymoron, but don't let that deter you. It's one of those 'what might have been' reconsiderations from several years down the road. Should-have-been college sweethearts, unforseen pregnancy, the out part of the equation having no idea that the woman of her heart has also 'gone gay' (but in a most interesting and, initially, shocking, albeit highly erotic, fashion). Read the book. And if you like this one, try SX Meagher's great uber epic \\"I Found my Heart in San Francisco\\" or RMB's uberish \\"Alma Mater\\" for college age lesbian romance.	2004-08-05

Sort of Xena and Gabrielle meet The Thing via X-Files. It can be read as a send-up of the sf and horror genres, but is, at the same time, a real nail-biting, stomach churning thriller. A great ride. The cocksure lesbian commander of a top secret base under the polar ice instantly raises the hackles of the slightly closeted doctor stationed there and it's an erotic game from the gitgo. Hepburn and Tracy, Beatrice and Benedick, and the amazon heroines of this novel who tease, throw things and curse each other out in style.	2004-08-04

Just when you thought there was no new wrinkle in the xenaverse, this bard arrives with the best 'meet cute' ever conceived. The title says it all. Life among the faults of southern California. This is such a witty book. (The Sequel is called &quot;Stirred.&quot;) The XU is, to quote another bard, &quot;so deeply closeted, she's paneling.&quot; But it makes for a thoughtful, gradual romance. Look up this author's online uber based on her Kilimanjaro trek and you will not be disappointed. Thrilling romance and great scenery.	2004-08-04

Great humor, suspense, and pride of place, makes you want to visit downunder.	2004-08-03

A monumental achievement (the author intends to write a novel length book about her characters for every letter of the alphabet) and a distaff look at life in S.F. every bit as significant as &quot;Tales of the City.&quot; Both of the ubers are young here and still in school, but it gives them an awful lot of memorable growth work to do for, with and towards each other. This would make a great series for the proposed gay channel, every bit as compelling as &quot;The L Word.&quot; And more romantic.	2004-08-03

They are partners who ride together (in a cop car) and fall in love. The depth of the characters if one is a competent (and Lori is more than that) writer are already established, in this author's case it's the great depth of the supporting cast of characters that surround these two women that lifts this book into a category that transcends &quot;uber&quot; and makes it a very significant contribution to lesbian lit. The sequel is just as fine and we eagerly await the third installment.	2004-08-03

This incredibly prolific, generous writer just keeps on sharing her unstoppable talent and imagination with us thankful mortals. This is the lesbian lit I yearned for as a kid. A great sequel and we hope she keeps this series (as well as her online XWP fanfic) going for many years to come. There was a great void to be filled and Miss Good has done it single handed like the great heroines she writes about.

I intend reading her mystery novels based on the strength of her writing here. But someone should give this book a better editing job, the typos are glaring and look as though someone let the spellcheck do the work for them instead of re-reading the manuscript for comprehension and it replaced words with some very odd alternatives. This is a novel every bit as moving as &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; (which should've ended with the women in a relationship as a couple.)	2004-08-03

Parapsychology, telepathy, ghosthunting, reincarnation, hidden family history, all revolving around the central lesbian love story set in the modern day, but framed, as well, by the angst driven forbidden love of their previous incarnations.

Xena online fanfic, esp. of the &quot;uber&quot; or 'real world' variety featuring incarnations of our heroines (based on the characterizations and physical attributes of the actresses who brought Xena and Gabrielle to life) has totally revitalized lesbian romantic literature and the feminist press publishing business. Thank the goddess for it. This happens to be one of the best of the lot because the author is a superb writer and storyteller. The newsroom milieu, the golf world milieu and the lesbian love story (the guarded, hardass Xena uber newsroom boss falls for her necessarily closeted on air talent, the accident prone, adorable Gab uber tv reporter) all ring very true. I just hope she gets around to finishing the sequel which is also posted online.	2004-08-02

This novel and its sequel are exciting, romantic, amusing and politically savvy enough for one to be able to accept the possibility as something that could actually transpire. A woman president...a gay woman president...who falls in love with her biographer (read &quot;bard&quot;). It's really quite a charmer. Believe me, you will not roll your eyes and say, 'oh sure, like that could happen.' This is an uber with a lot of heart and humor.	2004-08-02

What a great film this would make. It's sequel (also first published online) is just as wonderful. But this hugely amusing story is in a class by itself. Even the chapter headings are a riot of tongue in cheek double entendre. This wonderful book is possibly the most endearing lesbian novel ever written. The only thing that comes anywhere near it for me is &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes.&quot; Ya gotta love a book where the panic stricken ex Hollywood actress, scarred in more ways than one, is hiding out from life in her home town and happens to cross paths with the feisty high school drama coach who enlists her to help with her production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; Hilarity ensues, as does tender erotic tinged romance. These characters may be based on the originals but they come out in very original ways all their own. Sweetly quirky and unforgettable. This is a Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan romantic comedy for lesbians. Actresses complain they don't write great roles for them anymore, but they're just not looking in the right place. Lucy and Renee, just look at what you inspired. This one deserves to become a classic.	2004-08-02

She never ceases to continue to amaze and astound. I've read all of her wonderful XWP and Dar & Kerry stories online and am always left wanting more. Romance, humor, thrills...enjoy. She also wrote possibly the best first script by a fan for an established tv series ever in the Xena episode &quot;Legacy.&quot; You have to read these Dar & Kerry ubers in order beginning with the wonderful first novel, &quot;Tropical Storm&quot; which poses the breathless query, &quot;Can I ask you a personal question?&quot; in the most charming, sweetly sexy and unforgettable manner. D&K are one of the most endearing couples you will ever come across.	2003-01-16

Yes, indeed, it is Xena &quot;uber,&quot; an online fanfic phenom that has translated into first novels being published by some very talented writers, the sorts of books by women for women that I have been searching for all my life. This was one of the first and remains one of the best. It incorporates practically the whole overview of the series' dark backstory and character histories into what would be a great stand-alone suspense thriller by any standards, but which takes on a very special resonance and greater meaning when you fully realize and appreciate just who these characters are. Wow, how we'd love to see Lawless and O'Connor enact this, actresses dream of having roles like these written for them, and these two have inspired some of the best roles written expressly just with them in mind, wonderful variations on a theme.	2002-12-20

RMB's best since &quot;Six of One,&quot; though, as with every Rita Mae novel, there will be times when you want to throw it across the room in exasperation. This witty, sly, touching love story between college age women comes across as very familiar territory to those of us who've been reading the (now much of it published) Xena fanfic online for years and rumors are rife that this is indeed of the genre &quot;uber.&quot; It's the first RMB novel I've hugely enjoyed in years. Also, if you enjoy this, the similar themed and very definitely uber online and published novel by L.J. Maas, &quot;None So Blind&quot; will also be to your liking. Not to mention S.X. Meagher's wonderful near Dickensian saga of modern S.F. (a distaff version to rival Maupin's &quot;Tales of the City&quot;), &quot;I Found My Heart in San Francisco.&quot; Both concern the romances of college age women. The uber novels are some of the best writing by women for women that I've ever read.	2002-12-19

Downbeat, but compelling lesbian detective thriller	Superbly written, this uberish detective thriller ruined my sleep after I'd finished it, in sorrow at its outcome, but it's a powerful piece of writing even though I would've preferred an ending such as Sharon Bowers gives us in \\"Lucifer Rising\\" or K. Delacroix in \\"Engravings of Wraith.\\" Aud needs a lesson in WWXD. I was way ahead of her and totting up all her tragic hero mistakes, still it leads to a very palpable sense of doom and inevitability that give it urgency and immediateness, depth, and true tragedy and leads to the, also inevitable, to be continued lead detective series character (do I hear Adam Dalgliesh knocking?), the brooding, grieving, vengeful valkyrie. Lesbians like happy endings too, sigh...just like everybody else.It's almost as if our anti-heroine wants it to happen as a self-fulfilling prophecy to sabotage her own happiness. Oh, those brooding scandinavians!	2002-12-17
