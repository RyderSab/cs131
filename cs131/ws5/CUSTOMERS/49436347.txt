For those who study the &quot;direct path&quot; this book/author is a piece of your puzzle. The book contains the level of wisdom as Nisargadatta's &quot;I Am That&quot; which many regard as one of the most important spiritual book ever. For me this book provides some crucial descriptions of ego (&quot;I&quot; Thought). Our task is to break exclusive identification with the ego but how if we don't know enough about this ego. Most authors have been nebulous in their descriptions of the ego. One of the great qualities of Nisargadatta's books is that his words are as direct as his teaching. This book has the same directness. Every paragraph is meaningfull. There is no waste no repetition. Aziz Kristof's works also have this quality. I plan to collect Jean's other books as well.	2004-03-23

This book contains the most &quot;Spiritually Mature&quot; material I've read in any of the book's Neville has authored. In this book is something new, he sounds like an enlightened psychologist. He describes the interaction between the conscious and subconscious mind and the role of both in manifestation. Overlapping he gives description of the subjective and objective mind. How different are these chapters of the books from his earlier writings. He now knows mechanically how it all works not just that it works. His words have incredible depth and understanding. I once read that Neville was regarded as &quot;The Western Nisargadatta&quot;. I didn't think that title fit until I read Resurrection.	2003-12-12

Seedtime and Harvest opens up with the collosal statement that the Bible is written in the lauguage of symbolism and that all of its characters are personifications of the laws and functions of Mind and that the Bible is psychology rather than history. Neville is attempting to get us to see this work from his, enlightened, perspective.<BR>He also gives us a good breakdown of his version of conscious creation with the roles of Producer, Director, Author and Actor.<BR>Neville also has a great chapter on Faith and gives some substance to the the search for meaning.<BR>There are currently 6 bound Neville books available and I have found 3 on the web that are not.

Anybody interested in OOBE might have read Bruce's \\"Astral Dynamics\\" which reads like the manual for OOBE. His new book paints a fairly dark picture of the psychic realm with cratures like Astral Spiders and Astral Snakes. Sounds like, as humans, we are constantly being attacked from this dimension. Something as simple as a mole might be a sign of an energy attachment (drain) from the psychic realm.<br />I bought the book because he has an interesting method for removing skin blemishes with a ball point pen. I was in for quite a surprise when I looked over the book. Bruce paints a similar picture as do Carlos Castaneda's books of this realm. Bruce himself also seems to be a target of this dimension from what I've read. Perhaps he has opened himself to this through his Astral Travels.

The book is straightforward written in a slight &quot;sassy 70's&quot; lingo. One of the core chapters on the Subconscious David has you commanding your subconscious as your servant with no intentionality of it's own. His description might be valid and even better for this process of instructing the &quot;little man&quot;. The core practice is the &quot;secret&quot; of bringing in the &quot;Cosmic Forces&quot;. I tried this exercise with and without saying the<BR>lines and felt the same physical sensations (not judging just observing). One interesting thing about that practice was<BR>the mentally saying things while holding your breath.

It's refreshing to see such a book. Where other books lack the vocabulary to make such descriptions usually faulting language itself this one excels triumphantly.

For some students this will be exactly what they need.<BR>The book didn't have the impact for me like the words of Ramana (who is often quoted in the book) Maharshi or Nisargadatta.

I've read 3 of Wolinsky's books including \\"Quantum Consciousness\\". I started thumbing through \\"You are Not\\" at the bookstore and ended up ordering online. Although I found Nisargadatta's \\"I Am That\\" to be one of the most incredible spiritiul texts I've read, but I really don't get \\"You are not\\". The first thing that struck me odd was his conclusion that the \\"I Am\\" is a by-product of the physicial nervous system which sounds very much like the materialistic viewpoint.<br />It seems Wolinsky is trying to bring you to his conclusions via his path to the conclusion. The problem for me is that I'm not starting from the same place he did and it's not working for me.<br />Another thing I really disliked as extremely repetitive were his Wolinsky/Student \\"Enquirys\\" which takes up at least half the book throughout. The text for all can be summarized as:<br />-Wolinsky: \\"How does the concept called \\"my consciousness\\" which believes in the concept \\"I Am\\" feel about X\\"?<BR>-Student: It feels like \\"A\\".<BR>-Wolinsky: \\"If \\"A\\" was a concept of the concept called \\"my consciousness\\" which believes in the concept \\"I Am\\" are made of the SAME underlying SUBSTANCE including the awarer and had nothing to do with anything?\\"<BR>Student: _____ (Silence)<br />Another thing \\"I\\" found distracting was Wolinsky's quoting of \\"I\\" and \\"my\\" and \\"my\\" etc...throughout the book. It's almost as bad as trying to read Adi Da who also decides to make his own use of punctuation.<br />The one section I really liked was the beginning of part II where he talks about Ego Yoga and in part III something miraculous...AN ANALOGY! And a really good one about the ocean of consciousness. I guess I was spoiled by \\"I Am That\\" and the divinely delivered analogies Nisargadatta gives us which, for me anyway, go a long way toward explaining the unexplainable.<br />The reason I read this book was in hopes of furthering my understanding of Nisargadatta. I think toward that end I was better served by reading the words of Aziz Kristof (from his .org website). His writing rivals the clarity of Nisargadatta without the learning curve of the Wolinsky \\"system\\".	2002-08-13

I read it the first time in June of 2002. It quite simply is one of the best books on the Absolute (non-dual). In a very direct, no-nonsense style, Nisargadatta spells it out. The book is full of deep metaphors pointing us beyond the mind such as:  &#34;The personal needs a base, a body to identify oneself with, just as a colour needs a surface to appear on.&#34;  &#34;The mind exists in two states: as water and as honey. The water vibrates at the least disturbance, while the honey, however disturbed, returns quickly to immobility.&#34;  What is not poetically stated as such is given very directly:  &#34;To know that you are neither the body nor mind, watch yourself steadily and live unaffected by your body and mind, completely aloof, as if you were dead. It means you have no vested interests, either in the body or in the mind.&#34;  &#34;Self-remembrance, awareness of 'I am' ripens him powerfully and speedily. Give up all ideas about yourself and simply be.&#34;  The value of this book cannot be overstated I hold my copy very close and dear. From the perspective of sheer knowledge this book wastes no paper. The non-dual doesn't waste your time.  I've noticed in that the same depth of wisdom is given by a few others such as: Jean Klein, Ramana Maharshi and Paul Brunton. All are authorities on the non-dual. The reason for the similarities is that essentially the books are written by the same author, The Absolute, filtered through the personality/ego of the body delivering the material.  Note: Not everyone is ready for this book (i.e.the few 1 star reviews). I wouldn't have been had I purchased this earlier than I did. The longer I have it the more it reveals. I would almost swear it's changing with me.	2002-07-31

Burton seems well read as he quotes many famous authors who one gets the impression that Burton believes are beyond men numbers 1, 2 and 3 especially Goethe.

I read the same exercise in Osho's &quot;Book of Secrets&quot;.<br />Another important point is that one needs to review the day before sleep to help remove or soften any karmic impressions received during the day.

Pretending that one has no head seems like something for children to do. Harding's methods help one break through the subject/object duality of experience. All experience begins with the &quot;I&quot; thought. With Harding's headless method the &quot;I&quot; is no longer idenfied with it's customary location in the head but with what one experiences.<br />I admit I had a hard time with some of his language as there seems to be a slight communication gap (for me anyway) between British and American english.

Initially the book hits you with the psychedelic 60's slang and it becomes very obvious the author has done some work with our friend Lysergic acid. I've read some of the work of D.M. Turner and his psychedelic travels and the insights he has are incredible. I believe the insights obtained during such trips are valid, and Golas has some very good insights, but I would question that x number of such trips equal enlightenment. Golas admits to practicing meditation also so it's hard to tell what might have led Golas to his perceived \\"enlightenment\\".<br />I very much like Golas' writing style. The language is very down to earth and to the point and where needed he invents his own terms like \\"whatever-it-is\\". I agree with the majority of the books content. If there is any reason for the universe I would have to answer Love. Golas tells us that our contraction from love is the main cause of suffering. According to Golas \\"Love is the perfect means to enlightenment\\". It's important to love ourselves as we are and for being our unique selves and to go with the flow. <br />His writing is very good and has a couple of excellent analogies that stand out. One is how he describes \\"letting go\\" like listening to music. One must let go of the current note to hear the next and perceive music. The other is when he describes the body as an audience. Our bodies are formed of discrete entities like the audience. We can form statistical models about how each will behave. At the end of the show the entities go home and we see that each was a temporary constructor an illusion as Golas calls it.<br />There is a point in this book I see a potential problem with. Golas talks about the necessity of not avoiding negative thoughts. He maintains that resistance to negative thoughts will cause them to manifest in your life. The key word here is \\"resistance\\". Many \\"New Age\\" schools of thought content you get what you concentrate on. For them Golas isn'tindicating that we dwell on so called negative thought just that we not to offer it resistance. Resistance would add an emotional charge to these thoughts which would indeed increase their likelyhood of manifestation accordingly.<br />Also on the same point Golas seems to go against the 4th way practice of Inner Silence where one deliberately removes the internal verbal deliberation of negative thoughts. Through the 4th way work we gain control of our self by refusing to entertain and thus identify with thoughts that spring from the false or automatic part of our personality.<br />Golas has some psychological conclusions I find hard to swallow like that people with quicker reaction times are vibrating at a higher rate which is an indication of spiritual progress toward enlightenment. He uses the example of the cup falling off the table in Chapter Seven. I can't agree that any observable physical characteristics indicate the degree of one's spiritual progress. If that was so we could devise a simple test to gauge one's vibratory and spiritual level.<br />To conclude I find it noteworthy from his writing one can assume that Golas is not on some ego trip when he mentions the \\"Bodhisattva trip\\" near the end. He also says that no one person is worth more than any other. This tells me he is honestly reporting what he feels and has experienced.	2002-04-08

This book is a &quot;Jane&quot; book which contains some excerpts from Seth sessions.	2002-03-21

This book was fairly disappointing as mostly it was a rehash of material found in Ken's earlier books (which is still good stuff if you've never read it): The great chain of being, the pre-trans fallacy, the 4 quadrants, etc...The real value of this book lies in Chapter 12 where Ken gives &quot;pointing out&quot; instructions for the non-dual which are really excellent.

Hopefully the reader won't stop here but grow beyond the Walsch's and Redfields and Chopras of the world and move on to the great eastern works like those of Ramana Maharshi, Osho, Vivekananda, Nityananda, Sri Nisargadatta, Neem Karoli Baba, Babaji, Bodhidharma, Gurdjieff, Meher Baba, U.G.

Bill probably has one of the best descriptions of \\"mind\\" out there (and I've read Nisargadatta, Maharshi and Wilber). Bill's background in hypnosis has given him some unique insight into the inner workings of how our reality is presented to us through the paradigm of our mind. Bill's exercises for breaking this paradigm are similar to others that use breathing, watching one's thoughts and inquiry. While reading this book it's clear that Bill has been privy to something that is rarely experienced, that he has truly returned from the rabbit hole.	2002-03-21

The real value of this book for me lies in the second part where he describes development from the existential level through the higher transpersonal relams of subtle and causal and non-dual.

Perhaps in style but I would stop there. They both have a &quot;master&quot; who teaches a student through the use of wise &quot;quotes&quot;. Smiley's master is extremely verbose in comparison to Bachs. Part of Illusions appeal is the economy of word. There is so much said in such a little book with so few words it's incredible. &quot;Master&quot; seemed to tilt the scale on the other end with full paragraph descriptions of very inconsequential items. The &quot;wisdom&quot; offered in this book wasn't demonstrated by the characters as much as it was given verbatim in the &quot;Space-Time&quot; principles. Jane Robert's Oversoul Seven books are an outstanding example of using fictional drama to illustrate the Seth concepts instead of merely having your characters speak what they should be enacting. Smiley also used her book to lash out at meat consumers and other groups she has philosophical differences with. Anyway, for the adequate job that this book does presenting many Seth ideas it might be a good introduction to the Seth material for the fiction based reader.	2001-09-26

No this book is not technical, it doesn't give you practical techniques. There are a million other books that do that. This book, as well as JLS, lifts your spirit out of the human dumpster of repetitiveness and connects you to a place where you believe, if only for a moment, that God might exist, that there is a higher purpose for our lives that our lives have some meaning.

According to this book New York is underwater, California has fallen into the sea and most of the east coast has been re-written. This is not the first text to predict dire earth changes but makes very GENERAL predictions for specific years. Now that these years have come and gone without prediction of the prophecy what are we to think? I found the writing in the first half of the book very repetitive and hardly displaying the depth of material found in the latter half. In the back of my &quot;Mary's Message&quot; book is a paragraph about Byron Kirkwood's book (Anne's husband) called &quot;Survival Guide for the New Millennium : How to Survive the Coming Earth Changes&quot;...fairly suspect to say the least...The material greatly improves beginning with chapter 7 as it coincidentally loses its &quot;beat a dead horse&quot; earth changes tone. These chapters are well written and indeed seem to be spoken from someone with a &quot;higher than physical&quot; perspective and pretty much agrees with the &quot;Seth&quot; material channeled by Jane Roberts and some parts with the &quot;Abraham&quot; material channeled by Esther Hicks. I would suggest either of those authors in lieu of Mrs. Kirkwood.	2001-08-20

I'm also disappointed to see the \\"it's not Jane\\" condemnations. Who could ever know for sure that some part of Jane's survival personality was not involved in the production of this manuscript? We also know about channeling, Seth told us many times, that a level of distortion is involved in the process coloring the work through the mind of the receiver. FOR MY REVIEW.... The first thing about this book is it's size. THE BOOK IS VERY SMALL and in my opinion is hardly worthy [it]... However, I did find some valuable information in this book. I didn't read any ideas here that I haven't already read in a Seth book. The concepts presented here might offer a slightly different perspective but I believe reading Seth would be much more beneficial not to say cost effective.	2001-08-16

But one thing makes sense, that one person who should really know what Seth is saying in his works is Jane. In this trilogy I found that I could hardly put the book down during the first book &quot;The Education of Oversoul 7&quot;. This story introduces us to Seven, his entity Cyprus and four of Seven's earthly personalities: Lydia, Josef, Proteus and Ma-ah. The story is fascinating and meant to illustrate the interaction between reincarnational selves with each other and their entity or soul. The second book &quot;The Further Education of Oversoul Seven&quot; didn't hold my attention like the first. Two characters returned from the first book: Josef and Lydia. The story is written from the point of view of a new character William. You meet more of Seven's personalities and see the interaction through time with some of the characters and past or future versions of themselves. The material on &quot;The Gods&quot; seemed to drag the story down to a slow crawl. The third book was almost as interesting as the first. In &quot;The Museum of Time&quot; again Seven is interacting with his personalities except in this story he must assume a human body for a period of time. The writing is very good and the characters are interesting. Jane does an excellent job of illustrating some of Seth's concepts in her novels adding illumination in a way that is only possible through fiction.	2001-06-27

Where Newton's book focuses on the time between lives, Gabriel's book focuses on the time in the womb and seem very careful not to stray too far into the land of reincarnation.

This book kind of gives the \\"missing piece\\" and shows you both sides the positive and countering negative creation. This book, for me, will always be part of my \\"Seth\\" library. Strange to find in such a book is a chapter on \\"Earth Changes\\".

Journey starts on safe ground for most of us can identify with a skeptic when it comes to such topics. The book has the ability (much like Talbots &quot;The Holographic Universe&quot;) to keep the reader rivited and present enough evidence to allow you to suspend your overly critical mind for a while anyway.<br />Destiny, doesn't have the impact the first book does but does delve much more deeply into the topic. It's about 100 pages longer than the first and you get much of Michael Newton's conclusions thrown in which hopefully won't keep the reader from making their own conclusions if they might differ.

This is a &quot;spiritual memior&quot; which describes Michael Riggs' (Bhagavan Das) spiritual search. His journey reads like a who's who of eastern religion.

How wonderful to find such an open and honest work. For the seeker it is a tell-all from someone who has followed an extremely devoted path.<br />The book also functions as a glossary of terms. Every time Das uses a new hindu or buddhist term he explains it instead of assuming the reader knows them all.<br />Das also gives a good contrast between the Hindu and the Buddhist practices since he bounced back and forth between the two.	2000-10-12
