Boz tells everything about his college playing days at OU, including his relationship with Barry Switzer.<br />Brian mentions the steriod incedent and how he felt the NCAA used him as an example. Brian speaks of how the NCAA \\"prostetutes\\" it's players because the players bring in money for the school and the program, but the player gets no money for himself. classic example of the pimping business.<br />Brian also speaks of his rookie season with the seahawks, he tells of his hatred for the golden boy of Denver, John Elway, and his hatred of Pete Rozzell.<br />Brian's hatred of Rozzell stems from the use of the #44 jersey. Brian wore that number since he was little, and now, the NFL told him that he couldn't use it in the NFL, even though other players had done it. from then on, it was the beginning of a \\"beautiful\\" relationship between the two.<br />and Brian doesn't have boundries in the book. he talks of drug use among other players, alcohol, women, football, the NCAA, John Elway, Switzer, etc.<br />and the one thing that people never understood was, that Brian was actually a good guy, despite his arogant, Terminator like look. <br />he had a 3.0 GPA, finished a year early if i'm not mistaken, never used drugs, and wasn't exactly a player. the drugs/steriods issue is covered nicely in the book. he was a man who had respect for himself, and took care of himself.<br />sadly, his career was cut short, but the image of the Boz lives forever. the clean cut kid from Oklahoma who would turn out to be an All-American LB for the OU and became a modern anti-hero speaks his mind in Brian Bosworth: Confessions of a Modern Anti-hero.	2003-01-29

Kennedy	Books	2	2	16	N	N	horrible book and is the first indication	of a massive coverup in the JFK assassination. this book is just horrible, and the Warren Commisson was a fake from the beginning. the whole point of the commission was to conclude that Oswald and only Oswald was responsible for JFK's death and they can't do that beyond a reasonable doubt.<br />their single bullet theory is horrible and so are Oswald's motives. they couldn't duplicate Oswald's shooting spree and their only explanation for the head shot is a back spasm. they exclude important testimony and in most cases, never interviewed many important witnesses. another interesting fact is that some 19 witnesses died within 38 or 39 months follwing JFK's assassination.<br />then the members themselves.<br />almost all 12 had some ties to the Military in one way or another. the best example of the Warren Commission being a fake commisson is the hiring of Allen Dulles onto the commission. Dulles was fired by Kennedy following the Bay of Pigs fiasco and then 2 years later is appointed by LBJ to investigate the murder of the very man who hired him? Dulle's job on the commission was only to keep the CIA/Mafia/Bay of Pigs under wraps and quiet from the other commission members and from the world, and it worked.....unitl 1975. then, their cover was blown and more light was shed on what really happened on November 22, 1963.<br />horrible book.	2002-08-05

Dickey mentions Joe Montana's and Bill Walsh's fued, and how Debartalo was going to fire Walsh about 4 times but Carmen Policy stopped him. he also talks about the disaster behind Jim Druckenmiller and how the 49ers came to chossing him.<br />Dickey says that the 49ers were going to take a QB, and Walsh studdied 4 of them and said that Jake Plummer reminded him of Joe Montana, but he wasn't worth a 1st round pick. So the 49ers took Druck and it turned out to be a horrible pick.<br />Dickey also says that Bill Walsh was behind the pick of Reggie McGrew despite his knee injury.<br />what i don't like about this book is that i want to know more about what is going on on the field. the trades, the moves, some of the games, that stuff, this is mostly off the field.<br />good book though.	2002-07-08

Marrs book was so good that along with Jim Garrisson's book, the movie JFK was born, which in turn created such a fire storm, that the American Government had to pass the Assassinations Freedom Act!!!!! what other book has ever done that? not gerald posners. <br />this book covers everything. it talks about oswald, ruby, the cia, the mafia, the cover-up, garrisson, dallas, new orleans, the warren commission, the house assassinations committee, and even talks about both lyndon and hoover's role in the assassination.  this book is a bit long, and at times, you do get bored, but this book consisits of facts, unlike Posner who uses fantasy to make it look like Oswald and only Oswald killed Kennedy. <br />my favorite part of this book is when Marrs compares the whole Kennedy assassination to Julis Cesar. like Brutus says, \\"it's not that i didn't like Cesar, but i like Rome more\\". the same applys for LBJ, except he hated Kennedy and knew if he didn't do something, that is his childhood dream of becoming President would die.  if hoover didn't do something, he knew he would be retired as FBI director. if the CIA didn't do something, there power would dwindle, just like JFK had said. the Mafia needed to get revenge. like Jim Garrisson once said, everything about the Kennedy assassination points towards 2 things: the Bay of Pigs, and the CIA. <br />what's not as important is who fired from what window, it's about who killed Kennedy, who had the benefited, and who had the power to cover it up. figure this out, and you've got the truth to who killed Kennedy. <br />E'tu Lyndon?	2002-03-18

It gives accounts from varying witnesses and includes very neat and detailed drawing of the Alamo and certain events of the seige to give you a first hand account, and a drawing to go with it.
