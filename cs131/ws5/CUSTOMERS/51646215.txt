Darwin's World is a post-apocalyptic RPG that differs from others in the genre like RIFTS, Shadowrun, and most recently Gamma World by the fact that it contains very little to no magical or fantasy elements - in that respect, it's more like Twilight 2000.  What elements there are - mostly psionics - are easily adapted out if the GM doesn't like them, and that is a major plus for Darwin's World, because post-apocalyptic roleplaying shouldn't be about meeting elves for a romp through a magical cave; that's what regular DnD is for.<br />This hefty, 378-page book is broken down into eight chapters, one decent map, a great appendix of charts, the requisite character sheets, and a surprisingly good (for an RPG) index.  RPG Object's goal was to separate their post-apocalyptic campaign world, Twisted Earth, from the mechanics of the game, and in so doing create the definitive d20 post-apocalyptic RPG.  While they succeeded on the first count, they only slightly missed on the second, and with supplements, or a little GM research, Darwin's World could be exactly what they intended.<br />The first chapter covers character creation, offering a bevy of backgrounds and a collection of classes to cover just about anything.  Some of them seem very similar at first glance, but in playtesting prove themselves to be quite different.  The second chapter covers mutations, which you can use to build-your-own mutant; Chapter 3 is equipment, covering a pretty wide selection of weapons, from conventional guns to laser and energy weapons and power armor which you can use if the apocalypse happened in the near-future.  There are several sly references sprinkled throughout the book, and there are more than a few here to Wasteland and Fallout.  After that, you've got adventure ideas, and then the second half of the book is devoted to the Twisted Earth setting, which seems to be a pretty decent amalgam of several post-apocalyptic ideas from different movies and books (and games).<br />Presentation<br />This is where Darwin's World loses the most points.  The cover is outstanding, and the book is printed on a very high grade of paper stock.  Everything is organized very well, and the charts are readily accessible.  So why the low score?  The illustrations inside are inconsistent, and a good deal of them are really bad.  I don't mean artistically, but print-value-wise.  Some of them look like they were culled from the web - you can see the pixels and blur in a lot of them - and it's quite a jolt when you compare them to other, high-quality artwork in the same book.  The pictures of the guns are simplistic and awful, and I doubt anyone would find them helpful as an imagination tool (as a picture of a gun should be in a role-playing book).  With as much love and attention as they poured into the rest of the book, I'm surprised to find the images so awful.<br />Score: 3.5/5<br />Originality<br />On one hand, there isn't much to say about post-apocalyptic role-playing that hasn't already been said.  On the other, no one has yet to compile it into a useful, complete, d20 guide.  The Twisted Earth setting seems pretty cool (there's a bunch of stuff for it on their website), and the rules themselves are a godsend for any GMs looking to run a post-apoc. Game.  Kudos for that!<br />Score: 5/5<br />Playability<br />The nice thing about the organization of Darwin's World is that it is immensely playable.  The rules are adaptable enough to fit just about any post-apoc. RPG scenario, from \\"the bombs just fell\\" to \\"thousands of years after the bombs fell,\\" and everything in between.  Want to run a Waterworld game?  You can do that.  Want to run an Independence Day, alien-invasion game?  Got that too.  The d20 Modern rules aren't quite as squeaky-clean as d20 DnD, but they're pretty darn good, and Darwin pushes them to their limit.<br />Score: 5/5<br />Value<br />OK, it's really heavy (literally).  With almost four hundred pages, all of them useful, yes, it's a good value.<br />Score: 5/5<br />Playtesting and Conclusions<br />Having run several post-apocalyptic games in the past, I was eager to jump in with Darwin's World, and after scribbling up some characters, my group was ready to join me.  After our first fight with some raiders, we were duly impressed.  If combined with d20 Modern and other Modern supplements, it does deliver what it promised: the definitive post-apocalyptic d20 RPG.  And that's saying a lot.<br />Final Score: 4.6/5>Score: 5/5<br />Value<br />OK, it's really heavy (literally).

A combination of Bill Bryson travelogue and Dave Barry commentary, Murphy's &quot;A Year at the Movies&quot; is both a love letter to Hollywood and a controlled rant against the rampant overcommercialization and pretentiousness in that industry.  The gimmick is that he's going to see one movie a day, in a theater (or other form of public exhibition, such as an airplane for travel) for an entire year.  And, with one minor  exception, he succeeds.<br />Each week, Murphy pens an essay about some facet of the movie  industry and his experiences with it.  &quot;AYATM&quot; is basically a collection of essays about the state of public moviegoing.  They run the gamut from the hilarious (smuggling an entire Thanksgiving dinner into a theater) to the populist (well-deserved rants against Sundance and Cannes) to the emotional (spending the week of 9-11 in the Cook Islands, at one of the most remote theaters in the world).  Murphy is overly sentimental at times, and overly cynical at others, but he manages to keep on track and provide as fair a report as a movie-lover can give.<br />Murphy loves movies.  He loves theaters.  In fact, he loves the entire filmgoing experience, and that's what &quot;AYATM&quot; is about.  Readers complaining because he pans some movies and likes others are missing the point of the book.  His prose offers a smooth read in an accessible style, successfully circumventing the same kind of film snobbery he loathes.  For film lovers, Murphy's book is a welcome respite from the typical fanboy discussions on the Internet, and offers a cheeky kind of solace for those who don't  take themselves - or their films - with complete seriousness.<br />Final Grade: B	2003-01-13

Set in an area dominated by militias, survivalists, and the kinds of folks who like to blame Jewish people and blacks for America's troubles, Brin lampooned the typical, gutsy,  survival-of-the-fittest attitude in post-apocalyptic (PA) fiction, creating a unique blend of adventure story and important moral lesson.  In an interview, Brin said that most PA fiction revels in the downfall of civilization, creating a kind of macho paradise which would be great if you were a gun-toting conservative white male.  For everyone else, it would be hell, and that is exactly what \\"The Postman\\" tackles.<br />Fifteen years after the Doomwar, a combination nuclear,  biological, and chemical exchange between the US and an unknown enemy, Gordon roams the landscape looking for a cause to follow.  The largest organization in this atmosphere are a  loosely-organized militia-army, who follow the teachings of the deceased Nathan Holn, a racist whose beliefs about life and freedom were a mix of Ayn Rand, David Duke, and a badly warped Charles Darwin.  Gordon, a college-educated thinking man, wants nothing to do with the militias, but is inadvertantly forced into acting when bandits steal his clothes and he is forced to dress as a postman and invent a story about the Restored United States to get some food.<br />On his way, Gordon meets towns wallowing in drugs and violence, paranoid people so scared by oppression they trust no one, and an organization seemingly controlled by a computer artificial intelligence.  When the militias begin attacking the Williamette Valley in far greater fervor, Gordon begins to organize the resistance, aided in part by George Powhatan, an organizer who has begun to rebuild civilization in his own way.<br />\\"The Postman\\" makes clear that the downfall of civilization would not be a good thing, especially if you happened to be a woman, or black, or anything else not conforming to the WASP-militia stereotypes.  Aside from a good adventure story, Brin's book bucks convention and treads new groud, providing an obvious stepping stone for later SF novels in the genre like \\"The New Madrid Run\\" and \\"The Rift.\\"  The prose can be rocky, but given \\"Postman\\" was published serially (and wasn't necessarily aspiring to high literature), this can be overlooked for the far more positive points of its content.<br />Final Grade: B-n would not be a good thing, especially if you happened to be a woman, or black, or anything else not conforming to the WASP-militia stereotypes.

Irish poet Seamus Heaney's recent verse translation revived interest in the poem, and about the same time an adaptation of Michael Crichton's \\"Eaters of the Dead\\" (the author's own version of the Beowulf story), called \\"The 13th Warrior,\\" did well at the box office.  Around the same time Gareth Hinds hit comic stores with his funnybook adaptation of the poem, now collected in this volume.<br />The story is timeless.  Beowulf, a Dane, comes to Sweden to help the Geats fight Grendel, who has taken over the great mead-hall the Geats built to celebrate victory.  After some feasting and storytelling, Beowulf tears Grendel's arm off, and the creature flees howling into the night.  Then, Grendel's mother shows up and Beowulf has to take care of her, too.  Cut to late in the warrior's life.  Now, he must face a dragon when all but his loyal squire have left him.<br />In other words, the stuff legendary poems are made of.<br />Hinds' adaptation liberally borrows from what little Anglo-Saxon art remains (mostly sculpture).  The characters are all drawn in that blocky style, almost as if they are made of stone.  The exception is Grendel, who looks like some dripping fiend that crawled out of a swamp (which is basically how he is described).  The art captures the chill and danger of a time long past, when Grendels still walked the earth and people were not safe, even in the largest mead-hall.  The entire poem is not represented - the action sequences themselves are left to the comic form - and what is used, is used for narrative purposes.<br />Still, this Beowulf would make an excellent companion to a classroom study of the poem.  It uses an older (1910) translation, so there are some antiquated words that don't appear in the Heaney version.  There is enough to capture the meaning of the poem, even if it doesn't appear in its entirety.  And Hinds' drawings (ink, woodcarvings, and pencils all) paint a compelling, if bleak, picture of life in Europe's dark age.  This version makes a welcome addition to the study of Saxon poetry.<br />Final Grade: B+aint a compelling, if bleak, picture of life in Europe's dark age.

I think Poe appeals to the young and romantics (and the two are not dissimilar - there is an admirable innocence in both), and why not?  He was obviously a genius, who applied his incredible talents to the women he loved and idolized, and his own tortured, almost perpetually-adolescent soul is the definition of angst.  Therefore, my connection with Poe is sentimental as much as it is \\"fun\\" and scholarly.<br />Which is all to say that I picked up a copy of \\"In the Shadow of Edgar Allan Poe\\" as soon as it became available.  An unusual graphic novel - in the same style as \\"I, Paparazzi\\" which Stephen John Phillips also photographed - \\"Shadow\\" purports to be a \\"diary\\" left by Poe, rediscovered by a literary scholar teetering on the edge of decay.  Poe's diary lays out in graphic detail that the man was not simply haunted by the \\"demons\\" of bipolar disorder and alcoholism, but actual demonic spirits that granted Poe his abilities at the cost of his health, his loved ones, and eventually his life.<br />On one hand, this makes a great addition to the Poe pantheon.  What better explanation for a genius' macabre work than to explain it away by true supernatural forces?  On the other hand, it sells Poe and that very genius short - what way to better insult one of the English languages finest authors than to claim that he wasn't responsible for his own work - that strange creatures from another dimension wrote it instead.  Something about that doesn't sit well with me; one of the things take makes genius, literary and otherwise, so amazing is that people can sit and say, \\"he (or she) is one of US.  A person, another human being, did THAT.\\"  If you explain it away with divine (or profane, as the case might be) inspiration, much of the effect is lost.<br />Not that \\"Shadow\\" is a bad book - far from it.  Fuqua nailed Poe's writing style exactly, and the photography and graphic manipulation give it an otherworldly feel so familiar to those who \\"know Poe.\\"  There was obviously more than a little research involved in \\"Shadow,\\" and both the story and the illustrations reflect a sincere desire to honor the author.  Unfortunately - and maybe it's my own personal bias - \\"Shadow\\" ends up discrediting the very author to whom it pays tribute.<br />That being said, read at your own risk.  Whether you agree with their premise or not, it's still worth a look.<br />Final Grade: C+therworldly feel so familiar to those who \\"know Poe.\\"  There was obviously more than a little research involved in \\"Shadow,\\" and both the story and the illustrations reflect a sincere desire to honor the author.

It's not even close.  Instead of the first three or four letters of the alphabet, like a true encyclopedia, it's subdivided by COMIC.  Then, in the X-men entry, it's subdivided into Hero/Villain.<br />That could be overlooked if there was anything of value within the book, but there isn't.  Most of the entries are copied almost word-for-word (mistakes included) from the Marvel website.  To make matters worse, there is no cross-referencing between entries - but the hypertext links in blue from the website are STILL THERE - and some entries are so misfiled (Scarlet Witch, for example) that you might find her with a treasure map.<br />The information contained in each entry lacks any real depth.  Magneto's entry (one of the longest, almost three pages) is more artwork than text, and what little is embellished from the website mostly just repeats the same basic facts over and over.  The book even ignores the recent \\"Origins\\" story for Wolverine - an effort to get people to buy another expensive hardcover, I suppose.<br />The artwork comes either directly from the comics, or is Alex Ross' work reprinted.  It doesn't really add anything to something that was advertised as an information resource.<br />Volume One of an encyclopedia should have included entries on every Marvel character, organization, and major plotline in the letters A-E, in alphabetical order, with references to other characters, organizations, and events.

Along with Will Eisner's seminal works on the subject (which I have not read all the way through), \\"Understanding Comics\\" uses the graphic-text art form to dissect one of the most rapidly growing trends in both art and literature.  In an accessible, readable style, McCloud takes the reader through the history of comics, the definition of comics as a sequential art form involving symbols, and examines several major trends in modern comic-dom.<br />While there's plenty here for both the casual reader and someone interested in more scholarly study.  While it's more of an introduction than an in-depth exploration of comic study, McCloud provides enough resources for someone to continue study on his or her own, and enough seeds to begin sprouting ideas about the funnybooks.  Occasionally, he misses the mark - his definition of art, for example, is a little broad - and \\"Understanding Comics\\" isn't nearly as well-cited as it could be, but these are easily overlooked flaws.<br />Especially beneficial is his comparison of Japanese Manga comics with traditional American graphic storytelling, because the two are basically the same medium but evolved almost entirely independent of each other, until the last 15 years or so.  I wouldn't recommend it for the Sailor Moon fans, but those that enjoy anime and Manga will find much useful information here, in particular the comparisons between the two comic forms (not so much in any actual study of Manga in and of itself).<br />I highly recommend \\"Understanding Comics\\" to anyone who wants to - well - understand comics.  Whether you are interested in the ways Alan Moore tells a story, or want to deconstruct the use of movement in Dave McKean's artwork, or you want to learn why Spiegelman chose certain symbols and styles in his work, \\"Understanding Comics\\" gives the reader an excellent springboard to further study.<br />Final Grade: A-nderstanding Comics\\" gives the reader an excellent springboard to further study.<br />Final Grade: A-	2002-11-01

In fact, the idea that superheroes are fascist tools isn't a new one, and \\"Watchmen\\" explored that same issue, but from a Reagan-era hysteria point of view.  \\"The Golden Age\\" returns readers to a simpler time, when apple pie and the Stars and Stripes were good, and Hammers and Sickles and All Things Red were bad, and that was that.<br />Since superheroes, especially traditional superheroes, represent the same dualistic worldview- ultimate good and ultimate evil, with very little in between - it's natural that they be used as a vehicle to explore the darker aspects of living with such a limiting cosmology.  \\"Golden Age\\" takes some of the classic superheroes and does just that, focusing on the McCarthy-era, post-WWII hysteria.  On one hand, America had a lot of to be proud of, fighting a successful war to rid the world of obviously evil enemies.  But, on the other, the Red Menace was growing, an evil that no one could really define yet everyone agreed was bad.  Enter the superheroes, fighting for all that is good and American.<br />But where does the line between fascism in the name of good, and fascism in the name of evil, fall?  Or is there even a difference?<br />While \\"The Golden Age's\\" point isn't exactly subtle, sometimes ideologies must be taken to the extreme to show how their application would be absurd.  This it does with style and elegance, making it an interesting story for anyone interested in comics as literature, or as art (or both).  \\"The Golden Age\\" is definitely worth your time.<br />Final Grade: B	2002-10-30

Published in 1996, it combines a psychological thriller, a travel story, and a portrait of why young people decide to leave home for months on end and travel around the world.  While any and all of these themes could become (and have become, in other books) clich&eacute; in a matter of pages, it is a testament to Garland's skill as a writer and as a thinker that he manages to create a book that rises above stereotypes and actually concerns itself with the characters involved, and their real-world counterparts.<br />Richard is a British student who packs his backpack and heads to Thailand, looking for adventure.  His head full of Vietnam-era stories of war and post-Vietnam era stories of untouched paradises that lie just around the next corner, he finds Thailand to be simply an extension of the overcommercialized world he left behind.  When a suicidal maniac in the hotel room next door leaves Richard a map to a beach rumored to be like Eden, he sets off with a pair of French lovers to find out if the stories are true.<br />What he discovers is a place with natural beauty, but with a society of backpackers who, like himself, are trying to escape civilization for as long as possible.  He fits in with Beach culture, but the relative isolation and his conflicts with one of the other residents eventually lead Richard to take up residence more in his mind than in the real world.  When things start to fall apart, partially because of forces Richard helped create, he struggles to hold on not only to his life, but his sanity.<br />People have compared \\"The Beach\\" to other survival-style novels like \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" and accuse it of being many things it is not.  Both are unfair.  The people at The Beach are really little more than a bunch of potsmoking rich kids whose main forms of recreation include playing the Gameboy and smoking marijuana: that is precisely Garland's point, and it is, in a way, an indictment of both the backpacker culture in general and the optimism of youth that leads kids of that age to seek utopia without leaving the civilization they claim to hate.  Garland is fully aware of the contradiction, and this is one of this main points, and one he does not shy away from.  Although many fans of the book did not like the movie, one of the things the film portrayed accurately was Richard's enormously skewed point of view: he sees the world as a place to be compared with video games and movies, because that's really all he knows.  He's a character that the reader is not supposed to like.  It makes him no less responsible for what happens, but it's an interesting look into the psychology not only behind the traveler/backpacker culture, but into the general disaffection of world youth.  Why, when we are promised that things are supposed to be a certain way, do they not turn out such?<br />Garland weaves a fantastic book with \\"The Beach,\\" and its gentle meanderings, gut-wrenching tension, and ferocious violence are worth a read or two.

Alan Moore's \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,\\" part homage to 19th-Century literature, part unconventional superhero story, and an introduction to a new, periodical series from Moore and artist Kevin O'Neil.  In less-capable hands, such a project would be doomed to failure from the start, but Moore's writing and O'Neil's Manga-influenced comic art make \\"League\\" a triumphant piece of literature.<br />In the soot-choked London of \\"League,\\" where giant cranes construct gothic bridges and dirigibles are as commonplace as hansom cabs, Mina Murray, former wife of Jonathan Harker and object of Dracula's affection, is recruited by a Mr. Bond for an unusual mission.  Mr. Bond's supervisor, \\"M\\", wants Murray to team up with Captain Nemo and his Nautilus submarine to track down Allan Quatermain in Egypt.  Once they force his opium addiction into remission, the team recruits Mr. Edward Hyde, and his meek alter-ego Dr. Jeckyll, and a Mr. Griffin, better known as The Invisible Man, who is creating a series of \\"miraculous\\" pregnancies at a school for delinquent girls.<br />Once the team unites, \\"M\\" gives them their first mission: to investigate a Chinese gang ruled by a criminal mastermind, who has stolen a device that allows massive ships to fly.  There is concern that the gang leader will create a giant airship that will allow him to bomb and destroy any part of London he desires - which would be disastrous for the Crown.  While investigating, the League discovers that things aren't quite as they appear, which leads to a final showdown with a famous literary villain.<br />Moore's writing and O'Neil's art save what could have been a trite story and make it not only passable, but enjoyable and fun.  It lacks the literary and philosophical depth of Moore's other works, like \\"Watchmen\\" or \\"From Hell,\\" but \\"League\\" isn't really designed to offer some genre-shattering thesis.

Imagine my surprise when I came across of a copy of Cages, complete with traditional McKean artwork, on my comic-shop shelf.  I wasn't even aware McKean wrote graphic novels, let alone one of such size (it's 500 pages long).  I knew from the minute I saw it that I had to buy it, and after saving my pennies and dimes, I finally got the chance.  Not a moment of the time spent earning the money to buy this book was wasted.<br />In a style that fluctuates somewhat based upon the character being portrayed (although most of the story is told from the artist, Leo's, point of view), Cages tells a tale of three creative people together in an apartment building, set in some parallel-dimension London, or a similar city.  Leo, the artist of paints, canvas, and sketches, moves in and meets John, a novelist, writer, and critic whose work Cages earned him the ire of a public that misunderstood his point.  John must also contend with a pair of goons intent on making his life miserable, which Leo gets a chance to experience firsthand when he tries to save a young girl from their harassment.  The third is Angel, a blues and jazz musician at a local bar, whose poetry-slam style lyrics and dangerously emotional playing style set him apart from the other musicians, both as an artist and a pariah.<br />Rounding it off is a mysterious woman who poses as Leo's model, a landlord on the verge of insanity, a woman with a foul-mouthed cockatoo, and a naked homeless man who fell out of the sky five years ago and has been delirious ever since.

Until the publication of Bag of Bones, that charge may have been true.  No more.  In BOB, King leaves clich&eacute; (both genre and his own) behind and weaves a classic, sprawling, and wholly satisfying tale of good and evil, right and wrong, love and hate, and the living and the dead.<br />Mike Noonan's life - and writing career - come to a crashing halt when his wife dies of an aneurysm while watching an automobile accident.  For four years, he puts himself on neutral and glides through life, until he abandons his house for Sara Laughs, his summer retreat in Western Maine, on the shores of Dark Score Lake.  There, he meets Mattie and Kyla, a single mother and her daughter who happened to get mixed up with the greedy, semi-psychotic computer magnate Max Devore, who wants Kyla, his granddaughter, as his own.  Mike is inevitably drawn into the struggle, and at the same time finds that he, too, has a pulse and remnants of life.  So too, he discovers, does Sara Laughs, a house that harbors spirits and secrets galore.<br />Part romance, part meditation on love and life, part legal thriller, and part satire of the writing industry, Bag of Bones is King's only pure ghost story.  HP Lovecraft opined that any real ghost story is about love, and it is this, the most basic (and complex) of human emotions, that King explores - love for wives, love for children, and love of place.  He keeps his easygoing style and voice, but the subject matter in Bag of Bones is his most contemplative and mature, and while it has elements of horror (some of the ghost scenes are throat-closers), Bag of Bones manages to grow beyond that into a very serious novel.<br />For a writer as maligned as King by the so-called literary-intellectual field, Bag of Bones could be a thumb-in-the-nose, look-what-I-can-do sort of book, but it escapes pretension and snobbery as well.  Many of his books, written almost automatically in the 1980s and early 1990s, are downright formulaic, and there's a hint of that in Bag of Bones, but not much.  It is also his best ghost story, as none of the main characters are psychics - just normal people who can experience ghostly phenomenon, making it all the more terrifying for the non-psychic reader.  While The Shining pulled that off successfully, and Rose Red failed miserably, Bag of Bones keeps the hauntings grounded in something everyday people experience - that subtle, chill wind on a hot day, and noises in the night that may or may not be quite natural.<br />It's disappointing that King's retirement looms so immediately on the horizon, but if one book should stand as a tribute to his literary works, that book should be Bag of Bones.  It's a wholly different beast from The Stand, the other book for which King will undoubtedly be recognized for hundreds of years in the future, but Bag of Bones hums with a kind of tightness and literary prowess rare in any book, in any time.<br />Final Grade: Aically in the 1980s and early 1990s, are downright formulaic, and there's a hint of that in Bag of Bones, but not much.

Feist's epic Riftwar saga, a fantasy adventure spanning two worlds and multiple times.  In the beginning of the book, Prince Arutha fakes his own death in order to escape his city undercover, with the help of old pals like Jimmy the Hand and Amos Trask.  His goal: the northlands, to face off with the leaders of the dark elves, to attempt to put an end to the Riftwar and the strife within his own Kingdom.  At the same time, Pug and Tomas set off on a journey through the cosmos to attempt to learn about the unnamed Enemy, a creature of immeasurable power that threatens both Kelewan and Midkemia.<br />If that sounds confusing, then it might behoove the reader to check out the two Magician books, and Silverthorn, which set up the plot and characters that fight to the conclusion in this volume, the fourth (third, if you count Magician as one) and last in the Riftwar saga.  Here, Pug and Tomas realize the awesome potential of their power, and the dangers of the Tsurani attack for both planets is made clear - the struggle is no longer about resources or war, but a fight for survival that results in the final showdown in the ruined city of Sethanon.  As Arutha seeks to secure his family's hold on the Kingdom's throne, his journey parallels' Pug's and Tomas' as they seek to secure humankind's future against the threat of the Enemy.  It's a nice device, and it lends a sense of urgency and discovery to a story that threatens to be an imitation of Silverthorn.  And, much to Feist's credit, it succeeds for the most part.<br />It becomes evident that Feist might have had less fun writing Darkness than he did the other books in the series.  Where Magician was a personal journey of discovery, and Silverthorn was a fresh-faced pure fantasy set against the backdrop of the Riftwar, Darkness comes off more as a cave-in to certain fantasy clich&eacute;s rather than an upright, original novel.  This becomes more evident if you delve into the other books set in Midkemia, which barely achieve this level of excellence as they fall further and further into repetitive genre standbys.<br />Darkness is still fresh enough to be interesting, and readers who have finished the other books will want to find out how the Riftwar concludes.  Darkness isn't really intended for someone to pick up without reading the other books, which is fine, since it is the final book in a trilogy (imagine reading Return of the King without the other Middle-Earth books).  It makes a good capstone, but heralds the beginning of the end for Midkemia and its beloved characters.

Feist returns to Midkemia and his engrossing Riftwar saga in Silverthorn, the third (second, if you count Magician as one) book on the tale of the struggle between the Kingdom of the Isles and the Empire of Tsurananni.  A short while after the conclusion of Magician: Master, Prince Arutha is to be married to Princess Anita, a relationship hinted at earlier in the series.  On their wedding day, an assassin's poisoned arrow strikes Anita and the only cure to the poison is silverthorn, an elusive herb found far away.<br />With his entourage of fantasy staples, some of which are introduced for the first time into the Riftwar books, including Jimmy the Hand, master thief, and Amos Trask, sailor extraordinaire, Arutha sets off on a quest to determine both the nature of the assassination attempt and to find the magical herb.  On the way, Pug/Milamber and Tomas discover more information about the origins of the elves and the causes of the Riftwar, leading up to events in the next book.<br />Although Silverthorn is far more traditional fantasy than Magician - a typical Dungeons and Dragons party of adventurers sets off on a typical D&amp;D-style quest - Feist manages to maintain the epic feel of his work by establishing enough new characters, relationships, and overall Riftwar plots (the poison is merely a MacGuffin for the other events in the book) to keep readers interested.  Pug/Milamber is much more of a mystical or magical figure in this book, as he is no longer the main character and is instead a powerful force working upon the world in much the same way that wizards were portrayed in the Arthurian or Carolingian legends of medieval Europe.<br />Silverthorn makes for a compelling read, especially to those interested in continuing the setup in Magician.  The book is best read with \\"A Darkness at Sethanon\\" as the immediate sequel (some argue that the two books are really another full book, divided into two).  While not the absolute best in the saga - that honor will remain Magician's - Silverthorn is still a great \\"what comes next\\" book, and Feist has refined his writing style to make it a flowing, enjoyable read.  As fantasy goes, Silverthorn is a cut above the rest, but as it fits into the overall story, it is a must-read.<br />Final Grade: Bnor will remain Magician's - Silverthorn is still a great \\"what comes next\\" book, and Feist has refined his writing style to make it a flowing, enjoyable read.

Feist's Magician after it was subdivided for audiences with shorter attention spans, picks up some years after the first half ends.  Pug has been captured and enslaved on Kelewan, serving the Tsurani.  One day, a passing Great One (magic user) notices Pug's latent magic power and immediately takes him for magical training.  Unlike Pug's homeworld of Midkemia, on Kelewan magic users are revered, as they form the basic protective and governing body of the Empire (Star Wars fans, think Jedi Knights).<br />Pug, now called Milamber, continues his training until he becomes a full-fledged Great One, and one of the most powerful at that.  His mastery of the two paths of magic - the Greater Path, taught on Kelewan, and the Lesser Path, taught on Midkemia, makes him a force that few have seen the likes of on either world.  Milamber, exasperated at the Empire's treatment of his countrymen and its own political infighting, makes an important decision to affect what, in his opinion, will be the best for the Empire itself.<br />Feist begins to interject many more adult themes into Magician: Master, and those who dismissed the first book as typical teenaged fantasy fare are going to be disappointed, because they will have missed one of the most thoughtful fantasy books ever penned.  Milamber wrestles with the philosophies of power and the precepts of the Utilitarian principle: how far can one go before the ends no longer justify the means?  These are grown-up issues treated with grown-up finesse, and in a memorable scene where Milamber/Pug returns to the princess he forcibly left in Apprentice, the reader sees exactly how much of his childhood has been stripped away, leaving the adult.  So, too, does Feist's meticulous storytelling follow this model, sloughing off the final remnants of Pug's childhood for the adult he becomes.<br />For those who like their fantasy thoughtful and well-written, be sure and get both Magician: Apprentice and Magician: Master.<br />Final Grade: A-and Magician: Master.<br />Final Grade: A-	2002-08-03

Feist's fantasy classic Magician, originally published in the early 1980s and broken into two books in the mid-1990s, when Feist's work was gaining a snowballing audience.  Magician deals with the early life of two boys, Pug (the title magician) and Tomas, his more physical pal, both destined for great - or interesting - things.  Apprentice follows these two boys from the early parts of their lives, at about 12 years old, to their late teens.<br />Pug, the main character, is the bookish sort chosen as an apprentice magician in his remote outpost town.  Buddy Tomas is chosen to be a member of the Duke's guard, the profession obviously more preferable to the average teenaged boy.  Pug discovers that he isn't very good at magic, as he's barely able to work the simplest spells, even though his teacher's magical instruments say the exact opposite - that the boy is brimming with power.  A clue to this power is unleashed when Pug must protect the Duke's daughter (who happens to be his own age, and attractive to boot) from trolls and he manages to torch them all with fire from his hands.  Nice!<br />After establishing Pug's character and the relationships between the others, the Tsurani - invaders from another planet (and plane of existence, it seems) whose planet is hopelessly weak in resources.  Fearing the death of their culture and civilization, they employ powerful wizards (Great Ones) to create \\"rifts\\" to other worlds and times, so that they may hunt for the resources they lack.  It seems Pug's world of Midkemia is ripe for the picking, so before Pug has a chance to grow up, he's whisked off in the middle of an all-out war between the two worlds.  With the help of elves, dwarves, and other standard fantasy fare, the Midkemians prepare to defend against the invaders, while Tomas discovers an ancient secret that turns him into something other than a human and Pug is captured by the Tsurani and made to be a slave.<br />Feist's work is epic, no doubt about it.  The story starts off almost child-like and simple, with a small world full of wresting and games and a pretty girl that everyone likes.  It soon turns much uglier, and as Pug grows up and his concerns become more adult, so too does the mood of the book shift from the relative innocence of his personal youth to the gritty reality of war.  Feist has a likable, easy-reading style, and his enjoyment and knowledge of the world he's created is evident in every page.  Many fantasy books are only half-formed worlds with half-formed characters, or great worlds with paper-thin characters.  Feist has his cake and eats it too in Magician, making a world as real as Middle Earth and memorable characters about whom it's easy to care.<br />Magician is a great read for the fantasy fan, and if you find the book a little immature at the beginning, it's only because Feist employs this device to get into the head of his main character and show the difference in concern between Pug the youth and Pug the adult later in the series.

A novel of \\"blue-collar life,\\" \\"Empire Falls\\" follows everyman Miles Roby, a forty-two-year-old manager at the Empire Grill, the final restaurant holdout in the dying Maine mill town of Empire Falls.  The enigmatic Mrs. Whiting owns everything in town, from the Grill to the defunct textile mills whose closing began the slow process of decay that led to the events in the book.  Miles is joined by an enormous cast of characters, including his soon-to-be ex-wife, the fitness-obsessed Janine; their artistic but alienated child Tick; Max, Miles' Dionysian father; Jimmy Minty, Miles' friend from school and the main policeman in town; Zack, Minty's son, who isn't over being spurned by Tick in matters of love; and a whole host of other memorable characters.<br />Russo breathes life into these people through lengthy historical flashbacks, usually in the midst of their day-to-day conversations, a technique that lends the book a leisurely pace and prevents what little action there is from taking precedence over the characters and their development.  The \\"action,\\" which is really just an extension of the character development anyway, mostly revolves around events that lead each character to become more complete people.  Note: not necessarily BETTER people, but more COMPLETE people.<br />It's been said that an author can never create a convincing person, just a hollow shell.  Russo bucks that wisdom in \\"Empire Falls,\\" managing to create people so subtle and nuanced the reader would swear they are merely doppelgangers for the inhabitants of a real town - Somewhere, USA.  For that talent, no doubt, Russo took home his Prize, and deservedly so.  Engaging without being pretentious, and grounded without sinking into the muck, \\"Empire Falls\\" makes a fantastic read for anyone who enjoys a good, long character-driven book.  Other authors, take note: this is how characters should be developed.<br />Final Grade: Athis is how characters should be developed.<br />Final Grade: A	2002-07-17

In fact, it's kind of a way to know that your work is successful - as one artist put it, he knew he had \\"made it\\" when Weird Al did a parody of his song.  As a lumbering juggernaut of publishing power and kid-friendly fun, \\"Harry Potter\\" was ripe for the picking, and Michael Gerber takes the first stab with \\"Barry Trotter and the Unauthorized Parody.\\"  Unfortunately, it's a book so in love with itself and its premise that it becomes so mired in nonsense that the humor is lost in the first few pages.<br />Barry Trotter, world famous slayer of the evil wizard Value-mart, has established an agreement to keep himself at Hogwash School in order to boost attendance and enrollment, and to keep the trustees happy.  When a movie studio plans to do a film about Barry's life, fans overrun Hogwash, turning it into a mud-slicked New Age-ish Woodstock.  Headmaster Bumplemore, furious at the intrusion and the stupidity of these fans, tells the 22-year-old Barry and his buddy Lon (whose brain was replaced with that of a Golden Retriever after a Quidditch - I can't recall the parody word for it - accident), to put a stop to it.<br />On the way, Gerber finds ways to parody many situations from the Potter books.  There are some genuinely funny moments, but most of them involve the all-too-fleeting descriptions of characters (McGonagal roaming the halls, driven insane by Harry's constant troublemaking, is priceless).  The key to good parody is not to wear out your welcome - that's why movies like \\"Blazing Saddles\\" and \\"Spaceballs\\" are so short, and why other classic parody books like \\"Bored of the Rings\\" and \\"Star Wreck\\" rarely run over 150 pages.  Of course, \\"Barry Trotter\\" is still a good deal shorter than \\"Goblet of Fire,\\" but it grows very old very fast as the same jokes are recycled through again and again.<br />If you're a fan of Harry, \\"Barry\\" makes an interesting read, although adults will probably find it more humorous than kids (when it actually IS humorous).  Otherwise, it doesn't really measure up to some of the tried-and-true parody books.  Hopefully, someone will do a better send-up of the boy wizard, because he certainly needs one.<br />Final Grade: C-ind it more humorous than kids (when it actually IS humorous).

I needed something to read while waiting in the emergency room, and my best friend gave this book to my wife for her birthday.  She's the gardener, and my taste in literature usually runs towards the fictive, but I found myself enjoying \\"TBOD\\" in spite of myself.<br />Michael Pollan operates off of an unusual, but simple proposition: that plants have evolved to use human beings as much as we have evolved to use plants.  He uses four examples to illustrate his point: the apple (sweetness), the tulip (beauty), marijuana (intoxication), and the potato (control), each plant representing a basic human desire.  The way those plants use our desires is evolutionarily a good thing for the plant, allowing them to propagate like mad and become hardier and far more resilient to weather and disease.<br />As some of the other reviewers have noted, \\"TBOD\\" is pretty light on the actual science, but the target audience here isn't scientists or those who require heavy amounts of scientific proofs to enjoy a book.  It's a prose book, written for people who have little working knowledge of plants or the garden, and I found the historical anecdotes Pollan provided much more entertaining than his actual thesis (which is kind of one of those \\"well, duh!\\" things anyway).  His deconstruction of the Johnny Appleseed myth (I was born in Central Ohio, and grew up with it, so it was interesting to read the facts) was priceless, as was his treatment of the historical role of flowers and drugs like marijuana.<br />\\"TBOD\\" is well-written, and Pollan has a mastery of prose rare in writers these days.  His words not only flow off the tongue (or page, if you will), he knows how to craft a sentence and a paragraph to create and enhance the mood of the passage - it's a deft scribbling hand, indeed.  If you want a guide on gardening and plant breeding, look elsewhere.

Although claims of \\"yeah, but he did it first\\" are legitimate, Coupland's work should stand on its own as a great piece of postmodern literature as well as cutting-edge zeitgeist.<br />Coupland's three protagonists, all fed up with their respective lives, give up their unsatisfying careers to live in a desert retirement community while working \\"McJobs\\" (jobs with as little responsibility and meaning as possible) and exchanging stories.  They tell stories on road trips, they tell stories at home, they think and imagine stories, because they feel their lives lack meaning, and the only way to discover the \\"why\\" is to use others (and themselves) as an example.<br />The book is littered with side-panel cartoons and \\"definitions\\" of new terms, some of which have entered the lexicon as common words since the book was published in 1992.  The idea of the book - that people try to look for meaning in stories, although they won't necessarily find it - and the creative use of postmodern literary devices won't be as memorable as the mood and mindset this book manages to capture.  Moreso than \\"Fight Club,\\" which is as much a morality tale than a book about stories, \\"Generation X\\" manages to delve deeper into the \\"meaning\\" that Gen-Xers stereotypically cannot find.

The tagline on the inside cover to \\"Origin\\" describes the book as \\"The greatest Marvel story never told.\\"  Many fans, for years, insisted that it never be told: the beginnings of the mysterious, likable X-Man Wolverine.  When Joe Quesada and Bill Jemas took over and Marvel Comics and reversed its almost 15-year downturn, one of their first projects was \\"let's do a story on the origins of Wolverine.\\"  Considered sacred ground - untreadable because part of Wolvie's appeal was his unknown past - the project was reluctantly, and then vigorously, accepted, with top minds from the Marvel universe turning in treatments.<br />\\"Origin\\" is the gorgeous final result of that process.<br />Somewhere in the 19th Century, on a massive estate in Canada, a young boy called \\"Dog\\" Logan escapes his father's drunken beatings by playing with James, the sickly child of the rich landowner in the House, and Rose, James' Irish nanny.  The three forge a childhood bond broken too easily when class distinctions and family squabbles get in the way of their friendship.  One night, the tensions come to a head when the three, now adolescents, are involved in a life-changing tragedy that leaves one horribly scarred, another without a memory and in possession of strange new abilities, and the third frightened for all three.  Two of the friends flee into the night, while the third is left to pick up the pieces.<br />A quote on the back of the book compares \\"Origin\\" with \\"Watchmen\\" and \\"Maus,\\" and suggests it will enter the annals of comic-dom's highest-regarded works.  While it doesn't measure up to those examples, or to \\"V for Vendetta\\" or \\"From Hell,\\" \\"Origin\\" is certainly worthy of praise and deserves a place next to \\"The Killing Joke,\\" or \\"Batman: Year One.\\"  Kubert's illustrations are mind-bogglingly beautiful, managing to combine the serious nature of the story with the comic origins of the players without effort.  The only complaint, and it is minor, is that the book seems short compared with similar series efforts.  The story is told without becoming overlong, but the reader can't help but feel it could have been deeper and more involved.  Overall, \\"Origin\\" is worth its price, and the hardcover book preserves the fantastic art in a great coffee-table format.

Wolvie and X-Men fans will want to read it - unless, of course, you would rather not spoil the mystery, which is perfectly understandable.<br />Final grade: B+	2002-07-09

I *am* a major fan of Ravenloft - I've been with the campaign world since it was released in 1992, and began DMing adventures not long after - so I eventually caved in and took a look at the d20 version of it.  Thankfully, the Kargatane have saved Ravenloft from becoming totally extinct, but this book will be of limited interest to those familiar with the campaign setting.<br />It uses the same timeframe outlined in the Domains of Dread hardcover released in 1997, post Grand Conjunction and post Grim Harvest.  That means there is very little (read: nil) new information in this book as far as the Ravenloft \\"canon\\" goes.  In fact, this book is intended to be a \\"player's guide\\" (even though it deals with powers checks and other DM-only phenomenon), so it has only sketchy information about domains and zilch about the Darklords.  Want that information?  Get ready to shell out for ANOTHER hardcover book (two of `em, if you want all of them...)  The rest of the book is devoted to making 3rd edition characters using some of the customized character rules and races (half-Vistani, for example) from the DoD book.<br />So its safe to say that there's very little to interest the longtime Ravenloft gamer here.  Converting 2nd Edition to d20 isn't impossible - in fact, there are several freeware programs one could download to do all the hard work.  For those of us who have all the old material, and can play 2nd Edition AD&amp;D without a book because we know the rules so well (and yes, I DO have a life), there isn't much to interest us.  Since it's actually cheaper to scrounge most of the 2nd Ed. materials, I say go with those, unless you are dead-set on running 3rd Ed.  In that case, you better be rich...<br />Final Grade: D+ (it's Ravenloft, I can't flunk it outright!)<br />NOTE: I bought it anyway, because I'd like to see the Kargatane keep Ravenloft alive.  Something to consider when making your decision...decision...	2002-06-28

I thought the BG series was only passable, and much preferred the old-skool style of Icewind Dale.  I was going to buy Icewind 2, but when it was delayed another month, I needed some kind of RPG to take up my free time.  Enter NWN.  I discovered that, not only was NWN supposed to be a decent game, it came with a feature I'd been hoping for ever since playing around with the Bard's Tale Construction Set so many years ago (I hope that doesn't date me too much).<br />NWN has an extremely powerful editing tool built in, basically allowing the intrepid person with enough time and creative energy to create a game of infinite length using the NWN engine.  This is an unprecedented achievement for gamers.  Sure, mods like Counter-Strike for Half-Life made money and gathered hundreds of thousands of players, but to create those levels and make those modifications you had to be a pretty mean programmer, an elite 3-D designer, or both.<br />With NWN, you need none of that.  You only need this guide, and the Aurora toolset.<br />On my own, I was able to make a room where I could walk around and put a few monsters to fight, in a weekend.  With this book, I had four rooms, conversations, a boss, and lots of cool effects, in about an hour.  I know little about C programming save the theory (I know PASCAL, but again, that's gonna date me), and most of the game's groovy modifications run through C scripts, but with this guidebook in hand those scripts are no longer a problem.  There are examples for literally hundreds of different things to do, and from there it's a simple matter to extrapolate and change where necessary to fit your design.<br />Since Bioware has released little information regarding Aurora and their messageboards are a crowded, muddled mess, this book is essential for people who are pretty clueless about implementing scripts and such.  It's laid out logically, so you can learn important concepts in order, and has enough illustrations to show the most hopeless illiterate how to make a great module.  The only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that the writing can be a little spazzy at times, making it difficult to follow.  But it happens rarely enough that it isn't a concern.<br />If you want to design modules for NWN,  you NEED a copy of this book.<br />Final Grade: Alogically, so you can learn important concepts in order, and has enough illustrations to show the most hopeless illiterate how to make a great module.

To help this process, the corporate-controlled media provides its own version of the \\"feelies,\\" news and programs with little-to-no real content and designed to do one thing: entertain and distract (Postman's thesis, and not necessarily mine).<br />Postman rightly addresses several issues in the media, illustrated by the Kennedy-Nixon debates: charisma and beauty win in public opinion over content and reason any time, and television is the medium by which that victory is achieved.  Take the 1980s, and Reagan's election (which no doubt served as an inspiration for this book): although Reagan simply repeated catch-phrases with little reasonable thought behind them, his good-natured, \\"aw-shucks\\" approach to politics appealed to voters who ignored Reagan's logical flaws (and his scandals) and elected him twice.<br />Postman's book is obviously outdated, with the advent of the Internet, but his thesis has merit, especially in light of America's current \\"video-game\\" war against Afghanistan (when you lose one of your character's \\"lives,\\" the evening news is replete with the tragedy - World War II reported deaths in the thousands each day, and you didn't see mothers and wives dining with the president).  However, he never achieves the connection that the media - be it TV news, sitcoms, gameshows, pop music, movies, etc. - is about the ONE PRIMARY RULE of Brave New World (the society, not the book): maximizing profits for corporations and consumption among the commoners.  MSNBC, CNN, Fox (Faux) News Channel, and the local news (even the newspapers) - the one thing they have in common is that they are corporate-controlled and therefore are out to make MONEY.  It isn't the consumer that allows himself of herself to be duped, since that is all the consumer has ever had to deal with.  Truth, in American society, is a commodity, only to be used when that is what people want to hear - and judging by the current state of the nation, not many people care to hear it.<br />\\"AOTD\\" is an interesting read, but the reader should use it as a springboard to explore these ideas further.

It has gone through two major revisions, updating both language and information based upon new directions in religious thought, and added a chapter on tribal, animistic traditions found among the rapidly-dwindling native peoples of the world.<br />\\"TWR\\" covers all the major faiths: Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism. Smith explores each religion in its historical context, and uses examples from major religious texts to attempt to paint a picture of each tradition. His writing style flows easily, making for an easily-accessible book that literally anyone could read, although he can be a little spastic at times, switching from idea to idea and back again in ways that aren't always clear. This fault makes it difficult for Smith to explore any belief-structure to a major degree of depth, but since this is an introductory book, that's not a major problem. It's a taste, not the entr&eacute;e.<br />But it still tastes good. Smith takes a very non-judgmental approach to how he presents each tradition: he covers only the good aspects, except for some major historical points (the conflict between Christianity and Islam, for example). This means that there is very little comparison between faiths, except where warranted when one religion came from another - Christianity from Judaism, and Buddhism from Hinduism. Be that as it may, \\"TWW\\" is an excellent introduction for anyone interested in learning about different religions in an objective way. It's not going to spell out which religion is right and which isn't - like any good scholar, Smith leaves that up to the reader. Instead, he offers something to be enjoyed in the spirit of learning.<br />Final Grade: B+	2002-06-20

Like his first, \\"Seinfeld and Philosophy,\\" \\"D'oh\\" is an introductory-level philosophy text compiled of different papers and presentations given by various people in the philosophical field.  Arguably, the Simpsons provide a far richer crop of philosophical conundrums than the \\"show about nothing\\" (who else would soundly wallop objectivist `thought' like the \\"Ayn Rand School for Tots\\" episode), and that is reflected in the various chapters in the book, covering much of the major philosophical movements (although the moderns are strangely underrepresented).<br />Topics include whether Homer is an Aristotelian model (he isn't), whether Bart represents Nietzsche's Will to Power (the book says he might, but he doesn't), and if Maggie embodies the Tao (she does, to a certain degree).  There are more non-philosophical essays as well, including a great one of gender discourse and sexual politics, and essays on parody and allusion.  Unfortunately, due to the short nature of the essay format, these topics are never taken to any great degree of depth, but those looking for an introduction to philosophy will find them to be more than adequate.<br />As with any scholarly compilation, some of the essays are better (and better-written) than others, and the book's weakness lies in the fact that some of them clunk along at a jagged pace.  Some were clearly written for an intellectual audience familiar with philosophical themes and discourse, and some were written for a higher degree of accessibility.  That isn't to say that the essays aren't understandable, but the language, prose, and sentence structure of some (especially the more, um, dry examples) could be a real turn-off to those who would otherwise get a lot out of this book.<br />It's weak, but not too weak to overlook.  The only other problem is that the Nietzsche essay works from a VERY narrow interpretation of old Freddy's works, and should be taken with a grain of salt - but that's a personal problem with the book, not a professional one.<br />Grade: Book.

It's just the right size to hold Groo things, or your lunch, if you want.  It's the standard lunchbox size, and doesn't come with a Thermos (the only fault), but does have a unique Groo postcard inside.  The postcard has a glossy print of the main Groo characters one one side, and postcard-stuff on the other (what else would you call it?)<br />The handle is black, with Dark Horse Comics engraved on it, and the latch is made of sturdy metal.  The front has the Groo logo, with Groo eating a cooked boar while an army watches, scared.  The back is the same Groo characters round-up as the postcard.  The sides are a long Sergio-style cartoon with Groo chasing off a whole bunch of people.<br />Since they don't make Groo stuff in mass numbers like they do for other comic books (which is both a good thing and a bad thing), collectables like this lunchbox should be savored.  They are getting harder and harder to find, so getting one soon might be a good idea.	2002-06-13

Princeton-trained religious columnist Mark Pinsky offers a dual book in \\"The Gospel According to the Simpsons.\\"  On one hand, it is a survey of basic twentieth-century (and some earlier) Christian thought, especially Christian thought in the context of a more global society, as the Simpson's Springfield is a microcosm of American and World cultures.  On the other, it makes a convincing (although somewhat unnecessary) argument that there is a very valid reason to pay attention to The Simpsons.  Better-written, more accessible, and with far more depth than the \\"other\\" Simpsons book (\\"The D'oh of Homer: Simpsons and Philosophy\\"), \\"Gospel\\" is an excellent tool for those interested in either critical analysis of the show, or an excellent introduction to modern theology.<br />The chapters are arranged in an intelligent manner, outlining basic precepts of different Christian faiths: the idea of a personal God and personal prayer, the role of evangelizing, the existence of Heaven and Hell, the authority of the Bible, and so forth.  Pinsky does readers the service of exploring the Jewish tradition and even the \\"miscellaneous\\" (Hindu/Buddhist) traditions in separate chapters; although these serve as mere introductions to these religions, it offers a nice balance and places the entire book within a larger context.<br />Although those who have studied Christian theology might want more depth, those people aren't the book's target audience.  For those who want to make the teachings of Buber, Tillich, Lewis, Boenhoffer, and other recent theologians accessible to all (especially the low-attention-span, pop-culture oriented youth), \\"Gospel\\" is a great way to go about it.  The writing is clear (not surprising since Pinsky is a journalist), and the topics timely.  Fans of the show will no doubt enjoy seeing The Simpsons portrayed in such a positive light; satire is, after all, the highest form of humor, and the degrees of intelligence that go into understanding all of the show's intricacies will come as a reward for the diligent reader.

The result is \\"The Taoist Experience,\\" a collection of 60 primary texts with commentary, detailing the cosmology and practice of Taoism in a way never seen before in the West.<br />To refer to Taoism as a religion is misleading; it is a cosmology, certainly, but the Way is more of a view of the world rather than a specific tradition with detailed belief-systems.  That isn't to say that Taoism isn't as varied and complex as other religious traditions, but it isn't looked upon in the same way.  There's a Chinese saying that a person is a Confucian in their public life, a Taoist in their private life, and a Buddhist at the time of death.  This sums up the worldview that many Asian Taoists hold, and one that tends to confound both Western students and missionaries: it would be wrong to refer to one's self as a \\"Taoist,\\" because it would leave out very important parts of their beliefs.  For this reason, monotheistic religions have had a very hard time finding converts among the Taoist peoples, because they tend to amalgamate beliefs into a whole rather than accepting one set of rules and rejecting all others.<br />This diversity is what \\"TTE\\" celebrates.  It does not sugar-coat Taoism, and presents an even, historically-minded view of the development of Taoist thought from the legendary founder Lao Tzu through modern interpretations.  Furthermore, it paints a picture of Taoism in practice, and the way this unique cosmology blends with Confucian and Buddhist thought in varying degrees through the East.<br />For those interested in looking at Taoism from a scholarly perspective, \\"TTE\\" is an imperative, necessary tool.  There are no other books like this available, and there don't have to be: \\"TTE\\" is the be-all, end-all tool for Taoist scholarship.

This allows the reader to get an even and fair sample of Buddhist thought from the Mahayana, Theravada, and Vajriyana (Tibetan) schools, although Tibetan is less emphasized here than it is elsewhere (which makes sense, since it's a much smaller school in the Buddhist world, despite its overrepresentation in American pop culture).<br />Readers will be able to pick up on many important Buddhist concepts, including the basics (Four Noble Truths, Noble Eightfold Path, etc) and more advanced ideas, like the differences in cosmology between T and M Buddhism (the Arhat and the Bodhisattva, for example).  Beware, though: this is Buddhism as it has historically been practiced, and is still practiced in Asian cultures today.  It is NOT the feel-good, distilled tripe that passes for Buddhism on the spirituality shelf, next to the books on Wicca and similar religions.  There are graphic descriptions of acolytes being beaten, abused, and even killed by monks.  It touches on some of the wars that have erupted over Buddhism, not only in Tibet, but the bloody civil war that has torn Sri Lanka (Ceylon) apart.  Those looking to reaffirm preconceptions about a perfect religion that allows the practitioner to do \\"whatever\\" will want to look elsewhere - this is Buddhism as it IS, as it is PRACTICED, and as it HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY.  It's a great study tool, and imperative for anyone seriously considering calling himself or herself a Buddhist (and, some would argue, to do so is contrary to the Buddha's teachings anyway).  That isn't to say that Buddhism is painted as a horrible religion - quite the contrary - but neither is it sugar-coated, because it CAN be a difficult pill to swallow.<br /><br />Although Strong's book touches with far greater depth on Buddhist ideas than many others, it doesn't delve as deep as others into some of the theological debates that have taken place over the last 2500 years.  It's one step above an \\"introductory\\" text, and to go any deeper, you would have to dig out some serious college-level textbooks.  Thankfully, this is still accessible to readers of almost any level, although \\"TEOB\\" presupposes at least some experience with Buddhist thought.

Clearly written, intelligently presented, and relatively unbiased, it paints a fairly accurate picture of Buddhism in general and Theravada (Vietnamese, Indian, Sri Lankan, etc.) Buddhism in particular.  It covers all the major aspects of Buddhist belief: the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the Three Jewels, the Doctrine of An-Atman (no-soul), but with a definite Theravada twist.<br />Buddhism is very difficult for many Westerners to understand, simply because it relies on a very different worldview.  Most of the books available to Westerners (and I shudder when I see things like \\"The Zen Buddhist Tarot\\" in bookstores) are watered-down, feel-good nonsense that distills the \\"cosmic, dude!\\" aspects of Buddhism and leaves none of the religion's more difficult aspects intact.  Rahula's book does none of that, and manages to communicate the Buddhist cosmology very effectively - no mean feat, considering that an understanding of Hindu thought is almost necessary to fully comprehend Buddhism.<br />But make no mistake, \\"What the Buddha Taught\\" is an introductory book, and nothing more.  It contains no primary texts, and those interested in Buddhist Scripture and the actual PRACTICE of the religion in the world today would be better served to augment this introduction with \\"The Experience of Buddhism,\\" edited by John S. Strong.  Otherwise, \\"WTBT\\" is a good nudge in the direction of Buddhist thought.  If there is a fault here, it is that Rahula can wax a little in favor of Theravada Buddhism (he makes several sly stabs at Mahayana cosmology here and there), but that is to be expected, and the serious reader/scholar can overlook these faults for the much better whole.<br />Final Grade: B+	2002-06-10

Neither of those books are King's best work, and neither is Dreamcatcher - but it manages to one-up most of King's old works.  It's amazing how much his style has matured here, and the reader can tell what King admits to in his afterward: Dreamcatcher was written on a slower pace, by hand, with an inkpen, in notebooks.  No typewriter, no computer.  Take that, John Grisham.<br />The story follows four hunting buddies: Beaver, Pete, Jonesy, and Henry.  When they were young, they prevented a Down's syndrome child from a beating at the hands of the local football star, and in doing so, they managed to form a bond that goes beyond normal human understanding and friendship.  Now, they are in the woods and an alien ship a quarter of a mile wide has crashed.  To make matters worse, another hunter shows up disoriented, farting and burping ethyl alcohol and suffering from a bad case of alien trichinosis.  When his body erupts and a worm starts attacking the friends, things get bad.  When a crazed government agent named Kurtz (a nice reference to \\"Heart of Darkness\\") shows up, things get worse.<br />King has crafted a tale that, while not original, warrants more praise than It or Tommyknockers.  The prose isn't on the same level as \\"Bag of Bones,\\" and the story isn't as sweeping as \\"The Stand,\\" but Dreamcatcher is a fine page-turner, and one fans of King will no doubt enjoy.  His ability to create believable characters with realistic histories is where King truly shines, and he doesn't fail to please in Dreamcatcher.  It seems he's become obsessed with telepathy and psychic powers lately, although he manages that topic far better in this book than he did in his recent miniseries, Rose Red.<br />He doesn't pretend to be writing snotty literature, and that's what makes King's books so enjoyable - they aren't self-conscious.

But, after re-reading the book for the tenth time (or so), I decided to give it a shot.  Brave New World is the most important science fiction novel ever written.  Not necessarily the best, not necessarily the best-written, but the most important.  It is very good and very well written, but those are subjective points open to debate.<br />Brave New World, published some ten years before Orwell's more popular, anti-Communist 1984, imagines a world where people are conditioned from the moment of their birth to be part of an economic and intelligence-based caste, where the media exists for the sole purpose of distracting people from the humdrum of their lives and news is created as sensationalist entertainment, where different thinking is treated with social ostracization or drugs or both, and where the rule of the entire society is maximizing consumption of material goods.  In short, not unlike the world today, and America in particular.<br />BNW (the society outlined in the book) is a Capitalist and Freudian Hell, where people are manipulated to buy things they don't need and conditioned to be perfect molds for that manipulation.  The book follows three main characters: Helmholtz, a reporter who realizes the truth about BNW, Bernard Marx, a man who ultimately succumbs to the ostracizing criticism of his so-called \\"friends,\\" and John Savage, an outsider who grew up with books and without the benefit of BNW's conditioning.  All three eventually come to the same conclusions about BNW: that it is a society based on dictatorship-like control for the sole purpose of increasing consumer-base for a large, unnamed corporation-government.<br />As politicians are increasingly bought off with \\"campaign contributions\\" from corporations and special interests, news media is funneled into networks owned by five white men; physical and mental health is disregarded as the Randian, Capitalist mantra of \\"maximize profits no matter what\\" destroys basic human dignity; and everything from wars to game shows are turned into video-games for our amusement, it becomes very difficult not to make the prophetic connections between Huxley's vision and today's society.  In BNW, there are no protests because people don't care.  There are no dissenters because they are mocked into submission when they don't squeeze into the hole designed for them.  Take a stroll through modern America, and things aren't much different.<br />\\"Brave New World\\" is important because it, not 1984, is the vision of the future.  In a world turning into a Capitalist \\"Utopia,\\" where maximization of profits is the norm and consumption of material goods supercedes all else, one cannot help but shudder at Huxley's words.

Featuring essays by Noam Chomsky, David McGowan, and others, YABLT offers a mix of the intellectual and the borderline loony, and although most essays are well-cited, some of them rely on the same kinds of information manipulation this book is supposed to debunk.<br />There are several essays on how the media is and has been used as a tool to control information.  There isn't much here new for anyone with a passing knowledge of Brave New World, and most of what is here is a repeat of Neal Postman's \\"Amusing Ourselves to Death.\\"  There is an essay on the Bush family's connection to the Nazis (although it should be noted that there is a much better essay on the connection of American BUSINESS to fascist Europe) and Gore's awful environmental record.  Drugs are demystified, the Drug Wars bemoaned, the OKC bombing analyzed, Jesus questioned, and Columbus bashed.  All in all, a good helping of far leftist thought.<br />The book's fault is that many of the essays, as previously mentioned, ignore large logical holes and other pertinent information to make their point.  The Jesus essay is insipid, more the stuff of a whiner than a real Biblical or religious scholar; the OKC essay blatantly ignores several facts in favor of hyperbole; and the Columbus essay has been done before.  Of note are the \\"Apt Pupils\\" article, an excellent piece on the alienation of those who do not conform to antiquated ideas of normalcy in the American school system.  Also of note is \\"Who's Who in Hell,\\" an excellent list of the different humanists/atheists/agnostics/Unitarians and non-Christians who have made an impact in both European and American history.<br />There's enough good stuff here to justify a purchase, but it's a buyer-beware scenario.  One must not let his or her research end with this book - it's a starting point, not a finishing point for many of the issues discussed here.  Don't think that just because some of these conspiracy theorists are bucking the mainstream ideas of events and concepts means that they are automatically correct; some of the bibliographies couldn't stand up to serious scientific or scholarly scrutiny, although many can.

Wren's \\"A Gift Upon the Shore\\" is a rare bird indeed: it's science fiction, written about women characters, in a woman's style, by a woman.  Like other fiction written by women, from a woman's point of view (think \\"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water\\" and books by Barbara Kingsolver), \\"Gift Upon the Shore\\" concerns itself with more lyrical and emotional prose, thankfully glossing over male survivalist-style details for the actual story underneath, and does so much to its advantage.<br />The tale \\"Gift\\" tells is of a woman, Mary Hope, who survives a nuclear holocaust on the Oregon coast with newfound friend Rachel.  Rachel is an artist, who teaches Mary the value of the mind, learning, and beauty.  Together, the two manage to eke out an existence after the bombs, scavenging books from local houses and libraries to preserve for future generations.  The story is told from two consecutive points in time: younger Mary, just after the holocaust, and older Mary, telling the story to a young boy.  Both Marys are threatened by the ignorance of a band of ultra-fundamentalist Christian survivalists, who deem the blasphemous things in her books (such as evolution, plate tectonics, and other sciences) a threat to the order that helped them survive.<br />The beauty of science fiction is that it allows the reader (and writer) to examine possibilities and philosophies under the most extreme of conditions.  The problem is that most sci-fi succumbs to reducing those philosophies to mere stereotypes, and Wren comes dangerously close to doing that in \\"Gift.\\"  The Christians are portrayed as utterly ignorant, witch-burning psychotics or as sheep who merely follow along so as not to disrupt the fragile order.  Likewise, the agnostic/humanist characters are the only fully-fleshed characters in the book; the main villain is almost a laughable cardboard cut-out, almost not even worthy of the agnostic's attentions.  Wren's message is, of course, a vital one, but \\"Gift\\" seems to be preaching to the choir - with such obviously vile enemies, those who need to read the book will likely be put off before the message is received.<br />Otherwise, \\"Gift Upon the Shore\\" is a fine, fast read.  The prose clips along at a steady gait, although the book is somewhat hard to start (if you can make it past the first fifty pages, you'll be fine).  Wren chose to set the novel near the Willamette Valley in Oregon, on the ocean, which is ironically the location of the mythical, paradise-like St. Rose in David Brin's 1984 post-nuclear novel \\"The Postman.\\"  Whether this nod is intentional or not is unclear, but I doubt Wren ignored such a key book in the genre.  At any rate, even with its faults and somewhat heavy-handed moralizing, \\"A Gift Upon the Shore\\" is a very good novel, and deserves attention as such.  It deserves even more so because of the rarity of such a clear, strong female voice in this male-dominated genre.

So it's no surprise that Edvard Radzinskyi's biography is decidedly anti-Stalin (if it wasn't, one would have to wonder).  Unfairly touted as being based on \\"explosive new evidence from [the Kremlin],\\" making it sound more like a Weekly World News story than the compilation of research that it is, \\"Stalin\\" nonetheless is an excellent portrait of a purely evil man, but loses its possibilities in its somewhat narrow scope.<br />The story is told two ways: through stories of Stalin's life re-created from documents and official public records, and through stories told by people who knew and feared the dictator.  Every detail is meticulously re-created, from Stalin's sketchy early childhood to his rise to power as a revolutionary and thief and his eventual destruction and twisting of the Revolution into Stalinism.  People talk about Stalin's various moods and idiosyncrasies, and although Radzinskyi falls short of making any psychological conclusions about Uncle Joe, it's pretty clear that he's collected evidence to support a sketch of a very disturbed, power-hungry, and utterly moral-less individual.<br />The book's only fault is that Radzinskyi, in choosing which vignettes and quotes to keep and which to remove, begins to lean towards one solid view of Stalin: the moral, religious view.  There is precious little about Stalin's place historically or politically, and while the moral view certainly has its place (what book about Stalin WOULDN'T include this?) the reader is left wanting to know more about Stalin's eventual place in history, or politics, or sociology, or even psychology (which is touched on, although obliquely).<br />When all is said and done, this is an excellent book for those interested in dictators, Communism gone horribly awry, mass-murderers, and evil.  There are better biographies of Stalin out there, balance-wise, but the level of detail here is astounding, and makes this biography stand out.<br />B+evil.

While it was published in 1990, and therefore contains none of the more recently-published Indian writers (Alexie, Vizenor, much of Louise Erdrich), \\"American Indian Literatures\\" offers a decent overview of 1970s and 1980s writing such as Leslie Marmon Silko, and what precious little criticism appeared in that time period.<br />What \\"AIL\\" does, however, is compile a vast quantity of oral and written stories, fictional and not (although that term is used loosely when discussing Indian literature, that's the beauty of it).  The cover advertises that it contains information from 1772, and most of what Ruoff has compiled is in the early and mid-1800s, at least as far as oral tradition is concerned.  This is what makes \\"AIL\\" absolutely invaluable: this may be the very first time these oral histories were compiled not for historical or sociological interpretation, but for the purpose of examining them critically as literature (which Ruoff mostly leaves to the reader).  The Bibliography of Indian oral and written histories is immense, taking up nearly a third of the sum total of the book.<br />Anyone seriously studying Indian literature needs a copy of this volume, unless he or she relishes spending days combing through hundred-year-old books in the library.  The most important pieces are contained here, and the book helpfully tells the reader exactly where to go to find something if it is not published between these covers.  \\"AIL\\" is a great scholarly tool for the study of Indian lit, which MUST include early Indian literature if it is to be taken seriously and placed in its proper context.<br />Grade: A	2002-05-05

One of the few studies of American Indian (or Indian, to use Sherman Alexies preferred term) literature, aside from Ruoffs American Indian Literatures and Graulichs Yellow Woman, featuring Leslie Marmon Silko, Krupats book examines major themes of Indian literature as well as the role of the non-Indian when reading Indian books.<br />The Turn to the Native, while it serves as a nice overview of major themes, especially post-Colonialism and the ideologies through which Westerners always tend to view Indian literature, concerns itself largely with Gerald Vizenor and his Heirs of Columbus (two out of the four criticism chapters are devoted to Vizenor, and a full one of them is devoted to Heirs.)  Krupat identifies some of the Sartrian influences (and refutations thereof) in Heirs, while placing the book squarely in the larger context of postcolonial literature and literary theory as a whole.<br />But the main theme of the book is IDENTITY, which he fully explores in the last (and byfar the longest) chapter, A Nice Jewish Boy Among the Indians.  While obstinately about the role of the non-Indian reader in general (and the non-Indian critic in particular) in exploring and reading Indian literature, it really serves as a model for later criticisms of Indian work (and, Ill admit, it helped me in my own journey into this subject far more than traditional criticism ever did).  Told in the form of a story (what else?), it tells Krupats story as a Jewish-American immigrant and the offspring of Holocaust survivors, who share quite a bit in common with the Indians who, in their own way, are survivors of a different kind of Holocaust.  From that basis, Krupat manages to make several statements about the role of non-Indian critics (shaky at best) and non-Indian readers (sorry, you just wont get all of it).  As a non-Indian, it was refreshing to read, and it helped me immensely in organizing my thoughts about Indian literature and my place as a twinkie in it.<br />Essential reading for anyone doing scholarly work in Native American or Indian literature.

It debuted in the late 1970s, and, like other reviewers have commented, it is rather dated because of it.  It still makes a darn fine read, and Niven's skill at storytelling more than make up for the novel's faults.<br />An arrogant scientist discovers a comet heading towards Earth.  A concerned Senator manages to make it into his ranch in the hills above his Los Angeles constituency before it happens.  From there, he and his friends attempt to rebuild civilization, employing everything from Mustard gas to nuclear power along the way.  The \\"bad guys\\" are some hoods from, well, `da `hood, who join forces with some National Guard renegades and form a cannibalistic army.  It's a showdown of apocalyptic proportions (well, not really) that determines the fate of the world - or, at least, Hollywood.<br />Yeah, it may take itself a little too seriously, but Niven and Pournelle know how to tell a good story.  These days, the disaster and post-apocalyptic genre is filled with such books, but \\"Lucifer's Hammer\\" did the Deep Impact thing first.  Prose isn't perfect, but dialogue flows easily; like the more recent \\"The Rift,\\" \\"Lucifer's Hammer\\" is a monster of a book, but doesn't take long to breeze through at all.

While remaining firmly in the `snooty intellectual' camp Morrow himself satirizes in his later books, \\"TITWTWE\\" is still a good read, and is a unique addition to the field of post-apocalyptic fiction.<br />Sandwiched between bookends of Nostradamus, the plot revolves around main character George Paxton, an everyman who carves tombstones for a living and worries about his family.  When his neighbor invents something called a \\"scopas suit\\" that promises to be the device to change the nuclear balance of power, by allowing its wearer to survive and thrive after a nuclear exchange, George finds he cannot afford one - but makes a deal with a strange shopkeeper to get one on the cheap.  On his way home, World War III erupts and George is caught almost at Ground Zero as he watches his family die from intense radiation poisoning.<br />That is just the setup for the meat of the book.  George is rescued by a submarine and taken to Antarctica with five other survivors, to be put on trial for ending the human race.  The judge, jury, and executioners?  A race called \\"unadmitted humans,\\" who came to be in the time-altering effects of the War.  They bleed black blood and only live for a short time, but they nurse George to health so he can stand trial.  Those familiar with \\"Blameless in Abaddon\\" will recognize the trial as a means for Morrow to tell his story, and the reader is intended to sympathize with those who created the nuclear conflict through lies like \\"mutual assured destruction,\\" \\"deterrence,\\" and so forth.<br />It may be an artifact of the Reagan years, but Morrow's \\"TITWTWE\\" remains a solid piece of literature, even if it tapers off (as another review put it, the middle is a part you have to force yourself to get through).  Morrow's prose flows easily, and the trial is a clear indictment of both the no-nukes crowd and those who rely on nuclear weapons instead of human intelligence to solve problems.  As usual, Morrow neatly destroys the traditional dualism inherent in the nuclear debate, leaving the reader to formulate new conclusions after the two most popular choices have been proven wrong.  It may not be his best work, but it's worth checking out, and it belongs on any post-apocalyptic aficionado's shelf..

Oh yeah, it's po-mo...	... but it's also one of the most outstanding examples of Native American (American Indian, or \\"Indian,\\" as Sherman Alexie calls himself) literature.  Gerald Viezenor is a professor of literature at Berkeley, and his contribution to the Indian Lit scene is one of the least-known, most overlooked, and best-constructed books available in this growing field.  While it hasn't shared the commercial success of Alexie's books - partly because not many people are AWARE of Viezenor's book, and partly because it is not your average \\"pick up and read it on the plane\\" sort of book - \\"The Heirs of Columbus' is one of the most original novels in years, Indian or otherwise.<br />The \\"action\\" centers around one Stone Columbus, Native American captain of the Santa Maria Casino.  Every year, he and the other descendents of Columbus (who actually descended from Jewish Indians who immigrated to the `Old' World) get together and tell tales, and what follows is the result.  It would ruin the book to discuss it too much plot-wise, but it's Viezenor's constructs that really set \\"The Heirs of Columbus\\" apart.<br />Indian literature was the first to really mess around with notions of time, narrative, history, and place, all of which have become staples of the po-mo establishment (how's THAT for an oxymoron).  Viezenor almost seems to thumb his nose at the anti-establishment that has now become the trendy establishment, tongue firmly in cheek, saying both that \\"we Indians thought of it FIRST\\" and \\"you don't do it RIGHT, let me show you HOW.\\"  It's a nice change of pace from the usual blah-blah that most po-mo writers seem to think anyone with a latte will lap up.<br />The only fault is that \\"Heirs of Columbus\\" references a LOT of things that those unfamiliar with Native American culture (indeed, most non-Indians) simply won't understand.  Furthermore, Viezenor offers little to no explanation of what these things are, and almost taunts the non-Indian reader with the deluge of them.  It violates one of the cardinal rules of literature - that you don't have to explain everything as you go, and that it should be, at least somewhat, universal no matter what culture the reader comes from.

Thankfully, some of these books, like The Postman and Lucifer's Hammer, manage to transcend this trend and focus on the very human side of what might happen in a world where government protection is no longer available.  The Rift is one of those books.  Walter J. Williams creates a terrifying, but plausible, shattered Midwest where fears of nuclear spillage, racist gangs, and looters gone wild have become quite real.<br />The novel is enormous, and focuses on several groups of characters, including a skateboarder who hooks up with a black guy, an Endtimes preacher who begins running a despotic survivalist camp, a racist sheriff at odds with his community and his own values, a nuclear technician who manages to save millions of people with his skills, and a lady Army COE General whose leadership saves millions more.  Williams uses his amazing skill for writing dialogue to flesh these characters out, and the result is that none come across as overly two-dimensional.  The sheriff is still a decent man, the \\"good\\" guys aren't always good, and the Gub'ment can still be Big and Bad.<br />Williams manages to create a wholly believable scenario with wholly believable characters.  No one is going to mistake this with Shakespeare, but his dialogue is top-notch (did I mention the dialogue yet?)  It's a satisfying read (and it should be, weighing in at darn near a thousand pages), and moves along at a nice pace, never dragging, even during the \\"boring\\" parts (which aren't really boring).  A lot of writers could learn a great deal from Williams' style of storytelling; it reminds one of a mix between Stephen King (for ease of reading and storytelling ability) and Elmore Leonard (for dialogue and depth of character development through dialogue).  The premise isn't necessarily original, but The Rift definitely transcends the \\"post-apocalyptic\\" genre into more mainstream literature, but at the same time, it's a worthy addition to the PA library as well, if only as an example of what can be accomplished with a limited plot and a lot of skill.ng and storytelling ability) and Elmore Leonard (for dialogue and depth of character development through dialogue).

Michael Reisig's first major novel, The New Madrid Run, published by an independent press in Arkansas, is an interesting experiment not only in post-apocalyptic literature but in publishing itself.<br />The premise of the novel is a little far-fetched: a violent shift in the Earth's magnetic poles causes massive earthquakes and tidal waves, and the main character, a pilot and sailor in the Florida Keys, makes for some property he bought a long time ago in Arkansas for this express purpose.  On the way, he picks up some characters, meets some other characters, and eventually heads to a showdown with the main bad guy, a kind of survivalist general who has commandeered much of the local National Guard supplies.<br />So the story isn't original (even if the disaster premise is), it ends too quickly, the characters don't show much real development, and the villain is a cutout stereotype.  So what?  Reisig breaks post-apocalyptic convention on two important counts: first, New Madrid Run, like The Postman (from which it obviously draws inspiration), does not revel in the downfall of civilization.  It isn't some big free-for-all, where extreme libertarians don't have to pay taxes to the Evil Gub'ment  no more, and might makes right (although the bad guys are dispersed by guns).  Second, like The Postman, the survivalists are the bad guys.  In an overmined genre, it's refreshing to see at least a semi-sane take on the realities of a post-disaster America.<br />All in all, Reisig has created an interesting read.  The prose, while not Nabokov, flows nicely, and there are only a few times where the reader thinks that an experienced editor might have helped the novel.  For that is the other means by which Reisig defied convention; going through a small, on-demand press, he circumvented normal publishing routes and created a book and successfully marketed it both on the Internet and in his area.  No mean feat, that, and it beats having to pay an agent to sell your manuscript (although another editing eye is always helpful).  Certainly not a method for every writer, but one that is to be admired.  The product of these endeavors, while entirely satisfying, belongs on any post-apocalyptic aficionado's shelf, if only for the premise alone.

I got this handsome hardcover as part of a payment for some contract work, and I was touched by the story's tender narrative and peaceable message.<br />The bear of the title finds a note in the woods.  One day, he notices a woman reading some books outside of her summer cabin.  The bear comes closer until he develops a relationship with the woman, and she reads to him every day until she has to leave for the winter.  She leaves the bear her books, and when he hibernates with them, he is reminded of his friend and the fond memories they shared.<br />I'm not sure what's so touching about such a simple story, and my summary hardly does it justice.  I think it may be partially due to Jim Lamarche's illustrations, a kind of child-like (but excellent) kind of pastel crayon/colored pencil motif that manages to touch on the primeval aspects of youth still dormant in all of us jaded, twenty-something adults.  A Story for Bear has just the right blend of magic and emotion to make it a favorite for adults and kids alike.  I would certainly have no objections reading it twenty, thirty, or a hundred times to my youngsters (when I have them!)

Miller's A Canticle for Leibowitz sits on shelves with the masterworks of 20th Century science-fiction, like Dune, Stranger in a Strange Land, and Alas, Babylon.  Perhaps the first book (aside from pulp novels) that dreamed of a far-future, post-nuclear scenario, Canticle set new standards not only for science fiction, but it more or less spawned the genre engaged in serious examinations of the long-term effects of the breakdown of civilization.  Where Alas, Babylon and Earth Abides talk about the immediate effects of apocalypse, Canticle starts thousands of years in the future, and centers around a monastery somewhere in Utah, where the Order of Leibowitz keeps watch on ancient books from before some nameless war - endlessly copying them, but unable to comprehend what they mean.<br />One day, a young acolyte stumbles into an old Fallout shelter (he wasn't sure what a Fallout was, but he didn't want to meet one!) and discovers the remains of what appear to be Leibowitz himself (or one of his family members) - along with some holy artifacts.  This pressures the church to name Leibowitz a real saint, and gives the abbey a much-needed boost in funding.  Cut to a few hundred years in the future.  The abbey prepares to host a young nobleman who has discovered an ancient secret - electricity.  He uses the abbey's books to make a contraption work that generates light from a tiny glass bulb.  Cut another thousand years in the future.  Where has all this new progress led?  It's not difficult to guess.<br />Miller has a knack for prose, creating and developing likable characters and taking the reader on a personal tour through his labyrinth of personalities.  He keeps the reader grounded in the big picture by forcing him or her to care about a character, and then ripping that character out of the story in a disconcerting fashion.  It's a technique that works, and works well, as the ultimate moral of the story is humankind's eternal drive to destroy itself.<br />And there is the rub: it's a cynical message told for the first time by a special author.  That colleges still teach Canticle is a testament to its value as literature, but Canticle's message has been done so many times by now, in books, film, comics, and every other pop culture outlet, that it has lost its impact amidst a sea of imitators.  It's like trying to tell someone \\"I got the concert t-shirt first!\\" - they just don't care, because they have one, too.  And it's an unfortunate fate for such a fine novel.<br />But it serves another purpose as well: with the dismantling of the two main nuclear superpowers, there's a degree of hope in modern life that Canticle never could have had.  While we still run the risk of wiping ourselves out, it's something that has taken less precedence over smaller, more concentrated acts of violence.  Those are things we can deal with; the annihilation of our entire civilization is something much larger.  Even if Canticle stands as a mile-marker in human progress, it's an important one, and one to recommend to all sci-fi fans.there is the rub: it's a cynical message told for the first time by a special author.

McDevitt has created a fascinating and intricate society that exists some 800 years after a devastating war.  Learning and study are beginning to seep back into society in a way reminiscent of the ancient Greeks, and an interest in the past sparks a group of travelers to go in search of a knowledge repository called Haven.  The ancient civilization that destroyed itself (American civilization, actually) is called \\"The Roadmakers,\\" and one gets a sense that McDevitt spent more time concocting this world than focusing on the story at hand.<br />The travelers' journey is little more than a nice, if uniform, fantasy story with some science fiction elements.  For a story to be true sci-fi, it has to address modern problems in far-flung ways to attempt to demonstrate current human folly.  The sci-fi elements here serve only to distract, injure, and kill the band as they struggle in their \\"quest.\\"  If the adventure were as interesting as promised, it might have been forgivable, but even that isn't anything special - the reader is treated to different \\"mysteries\\" that turn out to be common 20th (and now 21st) century things.  It's been done before, and done much better, as A Canticle for Liebowitz.  But even the moral in that book is missing here, and all that happens is a few people get very rich and manage to imbibe their culture with fiction books.<br />McDevitt is a fine author (case in point: Moonfall), but this isn't his best work.  It comes across as a formulaic and dull story encased in a culture far too deep for what basically amounts to a pulp novel.  McDevitt's prose, too, seems less developed, and there is often little reason to care for the characters, and little to no character development at all.  In a day and age when such things don't seem to matter, Eternity Road might find readership among those who aren't used to science fiction like Liebowitz, Dune, or Stranger in a Strange Land - the same crowd that thinks Resident Evil is a good horror movie, or Triple-X is a good substitute for James Bond.

US	51646215	R7UL7538CWJQQ	0156002108	367931854	Towing Jehovah (Harvest Book)	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Religious Meditation on a Serious Subject	The first book in James Morrow's \\"Jehovah\\" trilogy, \\"Towing Jehovah,\\" introduces readers to the idea that God has, in fact, died, and His gigantic corpse is drifting in the Atlantic.  Tanker captain Anthony Van Horn learns this from no less than a dying angel, while attempting to atone for an ecological disaster he caused.  Soon, an emissary from the Vatican confirms it, and Van Horn is off to tow God's corpse to the Arctic to prevent it from decaying in the elements and to preserve whatever brain function God might have left.<br />At first glance, this might seem like a pithy, clever, and self-serving attack on religion in general and Christianity in particular.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Like any intelligent satirist, Morrow attacks the extremes on both sides; it is imperative that the mission is kept a secret to keep it from a public that might not understand, and it becomes important to a society of gawdawful liberal humanists that God's body be destroyed so that no one ever discovers it.  The humanists and atheists are the most obvious targets of Morrow's lampooning, and for good reason: the bourgeoisie snobbery they exhibit shows not only the narrowest of minds, but also one of the most hypocritical belief-systems on the planet (much like the fundamentalist Christians, who receive the lampoon-stick in the next book of the trilogy).<br />In fact, this book takes away one of the most ambiguous aspects of religion: the existence of God.  What God's dead body does is FORCE people to accept that He was, at least at one time, quite real and quite alive.  By taking God's existence as a matter of empirical fact instead of a matter of faith, \\"Towing Jehovah\\" can then outline a concrete, believable, and very real cosmology about the nature of God and the meaning of human existence - and, according to the story, that might just be what God was planning all along.<br />Morrow is an exceptional writer, although his style hasn't matured as much in this first book as it does in the other two.  His ideas show a unique kind of absurdist creativity, but that's a good thing: it is only in the most absurd, extreme situations that philosophies and cosmologies can really be tested.  Satirical science fiction may be the funniest way to do so, and the way that reaches the most people.  What good is theology when one has to wade through twenty volumes of Aquinas, or try to understand Heidegger's convoluted language?  By demonstrating philosophical possibilities, Morrow uses his exceptional talents to do his readers a favor.  To that, one must raise the glass and toast his efforts.  While Morrow's prose might not be Nabokov's, there is certainly enough allusion to keep it fresh and enough poetry to keep it timeless, regardless of the subject matter.

God's body has drifted free of its icy tomb and has drifted south.  The Vatican, strapped for cash, sold it to the Baptists so they could use it as the centerpiece of a new theme park, Celestial City, USA.  Meanwhile, Martin Candle, a small-time judge in Pennsylvania, learns that he has cancer.  Lured by the Baptists' promise of healing (which, not surprisingly, turns out to be a ruse to make money), Candle goes to Celestial City to be with God's body.  Needless to say, he's not healed.  In fact, his wife dies shortly after his return and, like Job, Candle wonders what he's done to deserve this.  A lifelong conservative and all-around good guy, Candle sees no reason that he should suffer - in fact, he sees no reason why anyone should suffer under a kind and loving God.<br />What to do?  Simple: do what Job could not.  Put God on trail before the International Court in The Hague for Crimes Against Humanity.<br />Again, Morrow presents readers with a premise that sounds self-serving and overly-clever, and again, nothing could be further from the truth.  Candle's complaint is a very real theological question - if God was all-loving, how could he allow bad things to happen?  If God couldn't stop them, He couldn't be all-powerful.  Therefore, God must know that bad things happen, God must be able to stop them if he's all-powerful, so for some reason, he does not.  Why?<br />Theologies have wrestled with the notion of evil for as long as there has been a belief in an all-powerful deity.  Candle compares himself to Job and Augustine, and those are reasonable conclusions.  But the answer \\"Blameless\\" offers isn't unique - Nietzsche posited the same notion in \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" - but again, it's presented in a way that makes sense to the reader.  Dualistic thinking does not serve humankind; it never has.<br />Morrow's book, perhaps the most compelling of the trilogy, is absolute pleasure to read.  He's finally found his voice, and manages to make the reader care more about the characters - instead of eccentric weirdoes, as per \\"Towing Jehovah,\\" these characters could be our neighbors - or even ourselves.  The story is told effortlessly, and the inclusion of The Devil answers another welcome question in his cosmological ponderings.

It's much different from the other books; not so much about psychology or philosophy, it's more a re-telling of the tale outlined in The Book of Revelation, although with an obvious Morrow twist.  As such, it might not appeal to the same kinds of readers that the other two books attracted, but \\"Footman\\" is in no way a lesser book because of it.<br />Years after the trial at The Hague, God's body disassembled itself piece by piece, His intestines swimming through the ocean like a gigantic snake and His skull sits in geosynchronous orbit over Times Square.  The Vatican rents His skull for advertisers, so people are treated to Microsoft and Coca-Cola ads 24/7.  But, it causes other problems as well...<br />In Nora's struggle and the development of the Temple in Mexico, Morrow reveals the ultimate philosophical lesson in his Jehovah Trilogy: that human value should not be created by external things, even God.  It's what Nietzsche referred to as the \\"metaphysics of the hangman,\\" and is echoed by those who claim that if there is no God, there is no point in living.  That is what the plague victims seem to think, and that is what the Antichrist seeks to capitalize on.  It is also what God wants humans to grow beyond.<br /> It's the ultimate religious/existential lesson, one that Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and even Heidegger stressed in their works.  It is also one of the most complex philosophical concepts to communicate, and Morrow manages to do it in one novel (actually, the setup was there through all the books).<br />Old characters are brought back, and new ones introduced.  Like \\"Blameless,\\" \\"Footman\\" is a walk in the forest to read, pleasant and dense without being oppressive.  Morrow again finds the correct mix of story and philosophy by which to tell his tale, and by so doing weaves as juicy and delicious a narrative for which one could ask.  \\"Footman\\" is much heavier than his other works, and is not simply the tongue-in-cheek satire of the first two volumes.  ...otman\\" is much heavier than his other works, and is not simply the tongue-in-cheek satire of the first two volumes.  ...	2002-04-02

It's a strange narrative, full of personal resentment, bigotry, lies, backstabbing, and manipulation, and Brock's conclusion - that the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy not only existed, but operated with the ease of many former (and infamous) well-oiled political machines.  Of course, this revelation is nothing surprising; it's kind of like when Alan Shepherd took the picture of Earth from orbit and, once and for all, determined that the Earth was not flat, but round.<br />The book begins in Brock's days at Berkeley, when the rampant political correctness that occurs on so many college campuses polarized him to more conservative views.  Brock reasoned, quite correctly, that the lefties who rattle on and on about \\"free speech,\\" but then stifle opposing viewpoints with vigor, are pure hypocrites.  So he migrated to the right, infuriating people with his (mild) conservative editorials in the school paper and making some \\"friends\\" in the process.  After school, when he took a job with a conservative Washington newspaper (owned by the psychotic Rev. Moon, no less), Brock honed his writing abilities and his broad conservative friend-base in Washington.  As time marched on, Brock's renown grew, culminating in the above-mentioned book on Anita Hill, which he dismisses as out-and-out lies and an attempt at character assassination (remember that the next time Rush Limbaugh cites it as a source, if Rush bothers to cite anything at all).<br />What follows is a collection of snippits and vignettes about various figures in the conservative community who not only advocate the stretching of truth and lying to \\"prove\\" their \\"points,\\" but who organize with each other to do so.  The deception was so great that Brock doesn't hesitate to use the term \\"Right-Wing Conspiracy,\\" as this is what it was: not an attempt so much to defame President Clinton, but instead to deceive and manipulate the American public for one sole purpose: the acquisition of power.  It's a strange, Machiavellian lesson, and one that goes against everything America is supposed to stand for.  Brock intersperses his account with tales of his closeted homosexuality, the issue which eventually led him to disassociate himself with the right.  These tales, while interesting, won't be of much concern to the more politically-minded reader, and may very well alienate Brock from the (typically homophobic) audience that need to read this volume.<br />Sometimes rough, sometimes far too personal (you feel like a voyeur in someone else's kitchen), but despite these faults timely and important, \\"Blinded by the Right\\" is a book Americans should read.  It serves as a firm reminder of the old notion \\"power corrupts,\\" and while the conservative American voting public may have the best intentions, the leaders who abuse both religion and ideals to win those votes do not.  Plato was of the opinion that the best leaders are those who do not wish to lead; with that in mind, how can anyone allow people like Brock's friends (or liberals, for that matter) to have the reigns of power in America?  Maybe it's time power went back to the people, not the politicians - and this book argues that case better than any intellectual's essay ever could.rious figures in the conservative community who not only advocate the stretching of truth and lying to \\"prove\\" their \\"points,\\" but who organize with each other to do so.

Heller couldn't have been more accurate; that sentence sums up Lourie's novel with elegance and accurate grace.  Make no mistake, as this is no history book.  It's a work of fiction, but one that is removed enough from the events surrounding its protagonist that it manages to resonate in such a timely fashion it lures the reader inside and doesn't let go.<br />\\"Autobiography\\" reads like a memoir, as it is intended, and follows two main trains of thought: the events the lead Stalin to have his main, exiled political rival, Leon Trotsky, assassinated, and the events that lead Stalin to assume the leadership of the newly-formed Soviet Union and set a standard for what Communism-cum-Stalinism was to be for the 20th Century.  Stalin's story is as much a response to Trotsky's writings-in-exile as a memoir, and the entire story is told not as Stalin writing a history, but as Stalin shoring his fragments against Trotsky's potentially ruining exposes.  Lourie's narrative shifts flawlessly from Stalin's \\"formative\\" years as the son of an alcoholic cobbler and a churchmouse mother in Georgia, to his time at the Seminary, to his career as a thief and revolutionary.  Stalin isn't so much interested in the goals of Communism - a better life for the workers, and so forth - as his is at using an opportunity to gain wealth, power, and prestige (although, neither do any of the other revolutionaries, save perhaps Trotsky).  Lourie outlines Stalin's disdain for intellectual, ineffectual Communist ideals and what eventually leads him to commit some of the most horrific crimes ever visited upon a group of people.<br />But, Stalin is difficult to classify.  From a historical perspective, even though \\"The Boss\\" outscored Hitler in the body count department, he managed to turn the near-medieval Russia into a modern, scientific, industrial superpower in a few decades.  It's the ultimate utilitarian argument: that the ends of struggle (any struggle, be it war, revolution, etc) eventually justify the means.  And that, in the end, is what makes \\"Autobiography\\" so powerful.  Stalin is never portrayed sympathetically per se - in fact, the book reads more like a profile of a serial killer rather than an autobiography - but, in his mad quest for power, it is slowly made clear that he feels the ends did, in fact, justify the means.  It's an interesting question - when do the ends no longer justify the means?  When is killing for a \\"better\\" cause no longer appropriate?  How many degrees of separation are there between Stalin and our current leaders - or even ourselves?<br />Lourie's lyrical, almost Russian, prose helps spin this deceptive, silken tapestry, and the structure of the novel keeps it flowing like a gentle but insistent river.  The only problem here is that the reader is never fully made to believe that the historical Stalin saw himself not as himself, but as someone in relation to someone else.  It is doubtful at best that someone as egotistical and monstrous as Stalin would have constantly compared himself to others - although, pop psychology certainly argues otherwise.

It's not often one finds a literate actor-personality so willing to share not only opinions but be open about the process that leads one into filmmaking.  But, it's so surprise that Bruce Campbell should fit into that category.  In his website updates and in person, he comes across as a down-to-earth, intelligent guy who seems more comfortable as a poker buddy than a high-falootin' actor.  His book, If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B-Movie Actor, reinforces that image.<br />Campbell starts at the beginning, with his parents, and goes through formative (and hilarious) experiences in his schooldays, including meeting Sam Raimi and other filmmaking contemporaries.  The stories about making Super-8 films during and after high school are great, as was the process by which the team ended up making The Evil Dead (not a bad guide for people looking to break into the `Biz, either).  Campbell talks about his experiences in other films and TV shows like Brisco County, all the way up until his recent involvement in Xena and Jack of All Trades.<br />Campbell's tour-de-force is as funny as it is informative, and his tongue-in-cheek style resonates and makes for a very easy read.  Even those not familiar with Campbell and his work, or movies in general, will find enough to keep them interested; fans will definitely want to give this book a once - or twice - over.	2002-03-19

Books	5	15	31	N	N	Kicking Butt and Taking Names	\\"Now is the Winter of our discontent, made glorious Summer by this Son of Bush.\\"  So would Stupid White Men, the most recent book from Roger & Me director and progressive activist Michael Moore, open if he were more inclined to Shakespeare - or found more monkeys to sit at his typewriters.  Fresh off of his campaign to elect Ralph Nader, Green party candidate, in the 2000 election, and his most-recent documentary film (still unreleased and officially untitled and under-wraps), Moore returns with this slamming, damning attack on modern Amerika - and all that implies.<br />Never one for subtlety, Moore refers to Bush as the Commander in Thief and pretty much goes from there.  Those familiar with his in-your-face style and unapologetic politics will probably want to pick this book up as soon as possible, and, if Moore is right, it's not a moment too soon.  Nothing is sacred here: lefties get the lampooning stick just as much as the righties, and there are equal chapters bashing Clinton (the best Republican president we've ever had!) and Bush (who, regardless of electoral votes, still lost by half a million popular votes).  Moore's a hard bug to pin down, but the main premise of his attacks is that both political parties aren't working for voters, but for their own self-preservation.  Heavy on issues like campaign finance reform, Stupid White Men concerns itself with taking on those maladjusted bastards who think the country somehow belongs to them, everyone else be damned: the Stupid White Men.<br />Even before it's release, Stupid White Men garnered much support by listing as an...bestseller, largely because of the censorship story surrounding it.  Over 40,000 copies had already come off the press when terrorists crashed airplanes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and HarperCollins, fearing that no-one would want to read an anti-Bush book in the post-9-11 world, was going to scrap the project entirely.  Thankfully, they only delayed it a bit, and even though Americans might not like anti-Bush statements at the moment (although recent polls show Bush's support has slipped to pre-9-11 levels), Stupid White Men's sales have proven that Americans care for censorship even less.  ...<br />Moore has more than made up for the utter lack of decorum he displayed after the 9-11 attacks.

Thankfully, Stupid White Men redeems him a little bit, and although his true talent lies in film and T.V., it's a good follow-up to his other books (Downsize This! and Adventures in a TV Nation).  SWM is meticulously researched, which is another refreshing thing about Moore - unlike Rush and his brand of blowhards, who inspire entire books citing facts that they either ignored or lied about, Michael actually bothers to do the research and back up his claims.

SWM is meticulously researched, which is another refreshing thing about Moore - unlike Rush and his brand of blowhards, who inspire entire books citing facts that they either ignored or lied about, Michael actually bothers to do the research and back up his claims.  It's a refreshing change of pace for the modern political writer...	2002-02-21

The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer is a fictional tie-in marketing piece, along with a fake website, a la The Blair Witch Project.  Although the authorship of the book remains a question, it is likely not the result of King himself, as the voice is very much unlike anything else King has ever written - although it is not out of the realm of possibility to think that his wife, Tabitha, might have written it.  The question, though, isn't whether the book is real or who wrote it - it's whether someone would spend his or her time reading it.  Unfortunately, like the mini-series - and the marketing campaign for the series - My Life at Rose Red falls prey to some vicious problems that eventually doom it in the end.<br />Reading like a subpar Edith Wharton novel, if Wharton were alive today and writing, the story itself is fractured beyond belief, and seems to run slalom between gothic romance, mystery, and obvious period fantasy.  Notice the lack of the word \\"horror,\\" because it wasn't scary - like the TV show, it pulled its punches way too early, and there was nothing left to be afraid of, because the reader knew what was coming.  The relationship between Ellen and John Rimbauer was uninteresting, and it left the reader feeling nothing for Ellen's plight - she came across as being a two-dimensional caricature rather than a flesh-and-blood character.<br />This book exists only as a marketing tie-in, but ABC dropped the ball with how to do it right.  The book was only released a couple of weeks before the miniseries, so most people who heard about it did so because of the miniseries.  If ABC wanted to build hype (which is clearly the point of the book), it should have been released a couple of months before the series - at least.  As it stands, My Life at Rose Red is going to serve as a footnote to a sad chapter in King's canon, as the miniseries failed to deliver on all its counts.<br />Intended as his own version of The Haunting of Hill House, King was originally involved with the 1999 remake The Haunting, and dropped out because of the bad CGI ghosts and schizophrenic storytelling.  So what did Rose Red bring us?  Bad CGI ghosts and schizophrenic storytelling.  The first part of the series was byfar the best, as it built up a good feeling of dread, even if the audience felt no connection with the characters.  The second and third parts, like this book, were so spastic and dumped all the surprises so early that there was no point in watching the rest - we knew how everyone was going to die.  It isn't horror, and it isn't scary - which is too bad, because the potential in the haunted house genre provides for much more than we are left with in all of Rose Red's forms.going to serve as a footnote to a sad chapter in King's canon, as the miniseries failed to deliver on all its counts.<br />Intended as his own version of The Haunting of Hill House, King was originally involved with the 1999 remake The Haunting, and dropped out because of the bad CGI ghosts and schizophrenic storytelling.

Pow! Form a new idea.  The plot of Tulsa author John Wooley's new novel, Awash in the Blood, seems much like King's signature bricolage, only here it's Vampires and T.V. Preachers.  Pow!  Bang!  With this strange combination, Wooley manages to craft a tale of utmost Gothic realism, a real spine-tingling trip into the macabre and a worthy addition to the vampire genre.<br />On a vacation-cum-missionary trip to Transylvania, the Reverend Mo Johnston, a second-rate T.V. preacher, saves a lot of souls for his show's \\"Hallelujah, Not Halloween\\" series.  Unfortunately, on his last night in the Old World, some kind of creature breaks into his room and bites Johnston - yup - on the neck.  Sporting some new wounds, Johnston heads home and convinces himself - and his television audience - that he's done battle with the Devil himself and won.  Except, he's not so sure that he's won.  His sexual attraction to Alicia, his female assistant, and other women, begins to override the more Godly parts of his mind, and Johnston becomes convinced that perhaps his vampirism isn't a Satanic curse, but instead a gift from God.<br />Wooley's done his research here, both into the glam-and-sham world of T.V. preaching in the evangelical, conservative, Protestant tradition and into vampire myths and other Gothic novels.  Unlike what passes as Gothic horror these days, Blood is devoid of stupid kids wearing black makeup, combat boots, and listening to Marilyn Manson and KMFDM.  It takes the Gothic horror novel back to its roots, weaving a story of love, passion, religion, and the supernatural that's plausible enough to believe but scary enough to make you turn the lights on.  It's a subtle kind of horror, one that comes out in the wee hours of the morning and taps you on the shoulder and, when you turn around, there's nothing there.  Creepy stuff indeed.<br />Blood also draws some interesting parallels between the emotions and passions aroused in Pentecostal-style worship services (or ceremonies in any religion that involve mystic actions, for those who are keeping score), and that's part of what makes Blood such a poignant read: it's a world not so far removed from our own experiences, and if it happens to Mo Johnston, it could happen to us.  Sure, he's no Lestat, but Johnston could be his younger brother.  Awash in the Blood belongs on the horror connoisseur's shelf right next to literature by Anne Rice and H.P. Lovecraft, and as far away from the repulsive dung that passes as \\"Gothic\\" horror these days as it can get.ing there.

David Brin, the Hugo- and Nebula-award-winning author of Startide Rising, The Postman, and Earth is one of those writers.  One of the three \\"Killer B\\"s of American sci-fi, Brin has returned with one of his most compelling and best-written books, Kiln People.<br />A chimera of detective novel, utopic speculation, dystopic fear, and dark humor, Kiln People is set in a near-future where golems, or inexpensive clones of people, are commonplace for those who can afford them.  Golems, or \\"dittos,\\" do all the things that you can't in a day: one might go to the gym and work out, another will go to the library and do research, while a third meets with your mother-in-law.  At the end of the day, the golem's memories are transferred back to the original person.  The action follows Albert Morris, a private detective who is investigating the murder of research scientist.  The story begins to fold in on itself as the lines blur between reality, fantasy, and cloned reality.  The climax and conclusion is classic Brin, and is as shocking as it is poignant.<br />Like all great sci-fi writers, Brin weaves a story of utmost importance as we approach a new century concerned about the notions of privacy and the ethics of cloning.  But he never hits us over the head with morality, and leaves us to form our own conclusions about the content presented here.  Add to that Brin's infinitely readable prose, and Kiln People becomes as accessible as it is important, which is a refreshing change of pace from a genre dominated either by juvenile, pseudo-gothic scribblings or stuff that's so far over most reader's heads that it belongs in a textbook.<br />Kiln People is an excellent, delightful read, and will appeal to fans of Brin's work as well as those interested in the current debates over cloning and privacy - and those of us who just like a good, if slightly unconventional, detective story. Brin is an author who can continually be counted on for great writing and outstanding subject matter, and he continues to weave dazzling tales here.  For good reading in the new year, you can do a lot worse than to pick up a copy of Kiln People - this science fiction isn't just for the nerds anymore.can continually be counted on for great writing and outstanding subject matter, and he continues to weave dazzling tales here.

The US and the USSR have nuked each other back to the stone age, and England has been left to its own devices.  A fascist regime has assumed power with the will of the people, with the simple goal of England's continued existence - by whatever means necessary.  Unfortunately, a genetically-enhanced terrorist, dressed as Guy Fawkes, has been blowing up buildings and assassinating key members of the fascist government.  The story belongs to this terrorist, who calls himself (or herself) &quot;V&quot;, but it's really about the differences between heros, villains, good, and evil.<br />V kills people and destroys property - innocent people at that.  He does it in the name of Freedom, but the Fascist regime V fights against kills innocent people in the name of England's very survival.  Who's the terrorist here?  Who's good, and who's evil?  It's a fascinating question, and like any great artist/thinker, Moore doesn't provide an easy answer.  Were the American &quot;patriots&quot; who fought the British by destroying property and killing innocent people terrorists, especially in light of recent events?  Is terrorism and patriotism based on our perspective?  Is there any time at which fascism, and his twin sister, nationalism, can be excused because it will ensure the survival of a people?<br />Fascism and nationalism are based on emotional rather than logical thoughts, and V's quest for freedom by terrorism is no better.  Either way, arguments for fascism and the methods V employs to fight - indeed, the methods by which any &quot;patriot&quot; or &quot;terrorist&quot; fights against a government - are Utilitarian at best.  Is this suffecient to procure freedom?  Must we always abandon some degree of morality, cutting our losses and giving away our souls, to live &quot;free&quot; or &quot;survive?&quot;  It's something worth considering, and if anything will make you think about it, this brilliantly crafted, lavishly illustrated work of art will do just that.  Enjoy.arguments for fascism and the methods V employs to fight - indeed, the methods by which any &quot;patriot&quot; or &quot;terrorist&quot; fights against a government - are Utilitarian at best.

Although the Japanese have been producing mature stories for years using both comics and animation, Americans are just catching on, but it's great to return to books like Watchmen to see how the entire movement developed here.  Moore has done quite a bit of work in the comic industry, but Watchmen seems to be the piece he's most well-known for.<br />What Moore presents is a story where super-heroes are nothing more than human beings.  With the exception of nuclear accident Dr. Manhattan, every &quot;super-hero&quot; is only a masked vigilante, and society has long since turned their backs on these &quot;uncivilized&quot; crime fighters.  Little more than a fad in the 1950s, super-heros have become a footnote, and now it seems as if someone's out to either kill them or put them in prison for good.  Giving away much more of the story would be doing Mr. Moore's perfectly-paced writing a grave disservice, but the struggle to discover the &quot;villian&quot; takes place against a Reagan-esque background of the threat of nuclear war as the Soviets invade Afghanistan, lending a sense of both urgency and historical siginificance to the work in general.<br />What matters here isn't so much the story, although it's interesting to read on its own, but the character profiles.  Watchmen, which refers to the old Latin saying &quot;Quis custodiet ipsos custodes&quot; - &quot;Who watches the watchmen,&quot;  is a study of what would possess a person to actually don a costume of, say, a giant owl, or a mini-skirt and scoop-top, and go out and fight &quot;evil.&quot;  What is evil?  Is the &quot;hero&quot; who destroys a family and ruins a child's image of his mother any better than the mother herself?  Can rape be excused if the rapist has saved thousands of other people's lives?  At what point does vegeance and morality clash, or coincide?  How sane are these people?  And, most importantly, who is watching them - who's making sure they act in the best interests of the people they are supposed to protect?<br />These are never easy questions, and Moore doesn't resort to easy answers - except once, and that is the single flaw in an otherwise perfect stained-glass window.  I won't give specifics, but let's just say that Dr. Manhattan's final answer to his Mars question is a real disappointment, especially considering the quality of the rest of the book.

Moore takes an interesting twist on the story - and one he himself admits that he believes is false - but the point of the book isn't so much a whodunit as a treatise on the combining of fact and fiction into myth, and the nature of sensationalism and crime in the 20th century.<br />From Hell features an amazing cast of characters and the story is told in sixteen chapters - two of which are a prologue and an epilogue.  Moore weaves historical facts together to form a cohesive story, and draws on dozens of sources, both Ripper-related and otherwise.  From Hell suggests that the Ripper was, in fact, William Gull, Physician Ordinary to the Royal Family and a member of the Freemasons (this fact is revealed very early on in the book, unlike the movie which IS a whodunit).  Where high-level criminologists like FBI profiler John Douglas (inspiration for the Crawford character in Silence of the Lambs) seem to think that the crimes were motivated by a fear of women, Moore focuses on the calm, ritualistic nature of the murders, and the important connection between the victims - that they all knew each other.<br />Although in this book the crime itself was a Masonic ritual, I think it should be noted that Moore isn't trying to smear the Masons, and that should be obvious to anyone reading From Hell.  His contention, one that more or less fits the 100-plus years worth of facts, is that William Gull was gradually going insane and had visions about Masonic deities - shreds of old ritual from Freemasonry's past that he blows out of proportion and begins to manifest, at least in his mind.  There was nothing anti-Freemason in this book, but I realize people have to find something to get bent out of shape about.<br />The crowning achievement of this volume isn't the way Moore creates a perfect fit for Gull as the Ripper, but the appendix at the end in which he details the painstaking amount of research that went into this work.  He has a reference for nearly every factual detail, and readily admits when he makes things up or dramatizes certain events for the story.  It's an excellent resource for Ripperologists and scholars interested in Moore's book, and its inclusion is what makes From Hell such a fascinating read.<br />I absolutely recommend From Hell, especially if you enjoyed the film - the book is far more detailed, and doesn't sacrifice any historical accuracies to make a better story, as the movie did.  If the film is a starting point, this graphic novel is the logical conclusion.  Get it today; you will not be sorry you did.The crowning achievement of this volume isn't the way Moore creates a perfect fit for Gull as the Ripper, but the appendix at the end in which he details the painstaking amount of research that went into this work.

William Brinkley's stunning post-apocalyptic novel should, perhaps, become the standard by which all other P-A literature is to be evaluated.  It has every stereotype, every non-stereotype, and, most important of all, it IS literature - unlike so many of pulp-style novels in this genre.  Brinkley's language is a true pleasure to read, much like Nabokov's or  Joyce's, and the dialogue is still realistic and believable.<br />The story is told out of chronology, starting with landfall on an island as the crew of a United States Naval Missile Cruiser searches for habitable land.  Although the apocalypse is only hinted at, we soon rewind to the moments directly leading up to the launch (in which our ship plays a role) and the crew's  journey away from the shattered world in a search for life and a place to land.  They must deal with Russian (Soviet) submarines, mutiny, and the usual dangers of people at sea.<br />As the cover blurb indicates, the odd element in this book is the inclusion of women.  Many post-apocalyptic books include women only as tertiary or minor characters; in The Last Ship, the captain (wisely) turns over a major decision to the women on board his ship.  The book becomes as much a character study in gender as it does a delightful read or harrowing journey through a nuclear wasteland.  The experiment works, and Brinkley manages to present us with something original, interesting, and accessable.<br />I would recommend this novel over many others in the post-apocalyptic genre.  The sheer pleasure I get from reading the language - and my interest in the subject matter - will keep me coming back for many future re-readings.	2001-10-18

The Grammar!	It's a rare quality that a textbook - for that is, essentially, what Karen Elizabeth Gordon's &quot;Deluxe Transitive Vampire&quot; is - can actually entertain the reader as well.  It's even more rare to find a book that actually makes something as dull and obtuse as English Grammar seem interesting and - dare I say it - fun?<br />I was introduced to this book as part of a college-level grammar class that I'd been putting off until my senior year.  Although I fancy myself a decent writer, I couldn't tell anyone what a gerund was, or how to diagram a sentence, to save my life.  I knew the rules of grammar intuitively, but I just didn't know what they were called.  I'd be lying if I said this book taught me, but it certainly set me on the right path, and took away a good deal of the dread of looking such things up.<br />Illustrated liberally with a spattering of Victorian-style Gothic imagery, and incorporating semi-stories about vampires, debutantes, trolls, and tea parties, the Deluxe Transitive Vampire is a great guide to grammar, from the simplest rules about nouns and verbs to the most abtract, outlandish little &quot;English-isms&quot; in our language.  It's a pleasure to browse through, and when you have to turn to it, it never fails to bring a chuckle (or a shudder).<br />Deluxe Transitive Vampire belongs on any writer's shelf, between the Stunk and White and the Thesaurus.	2001-09-24

That village was Gaviotas; this book is his result.<br />I read this book on a recommendation from Daniel Quinn, author of &quot;The Story of B&quot; and &quot;Beyond Civilization.&quot;  Quinn's entire philosophy rests on two ideas: living in a sustainable manner, and allowing the reader to come up with their own solutions for doing so.  Gaviotas is a community where people did just that - through ingenuity, creativity, and hard work, the residents of this planned village created a place where water is pulled from the ground using pumps attached to children's see-saws, heat is provided by the sun, and electricity by the wind.<br />It's a progressive's dream come true, and an experiment that has succeeded in all possible ways.  This book lays out the history of Gaviotas and its unique founder, Paolo Lugari, and places it within the context of the ongoing struggles in Colombia.  In the wake of the World Trade Center attack, I decided to re-read Gaviotas to remind myself that not only is there hope for humanity as a whole, but hope that individuals will begin to take responsibility to begin freeing ourselves from the confining forces of our self-imposed prisons called &quot;civilization,&quot; but still manage to retain the good things, too.<br />Every person on earth should read and re-read this book.  If you haven't, buy it now or start hoofing it to the library.	2001-09-15
US	51646215	RLFEU2UK8EOA5	0486201058	375854651	Supernatural Horror in Literature	Books	4	1	1	N	N	An Excellent Resource, Scholarly and Entertaining	Sometimes unfairly glossed over and ignored, sometimes unfairly given more credit than he deserves, Howard Phillips (H.P.) Lovecraft's gothic horror novels and stories set a new standard for American horror literature and, most likely, influenced horror writers the world over.  That he is the master of setting, scene, and utter creepiness there is no doubt, but many will debate the effectiveness of his &quot;Out of Time&quot; creatures as genuine fright-inducers versus just plain strange and weird... whatevers.<br />This book, however, is one of Lovecraft's rare pieces of nonfiction - a scholarly survey on the history of supernatural horror throughout literature.  Obviously well-researched and excruciatingly well-written, it makes a fine resource for anyone interested in this subject, although its obvious fault is that it covers nothing beyond 1927 - and doesn't touch nearly enough on Lovecraft's own work.  For a reference resource on post-1930s horror literature (and television, and film, which became important mediums after this volume was written), check out Stephen King's Danse Macabre.<br />This book makes a good investment for scholars interested in Lovecraft or horror, and is written in a way that makes it accessible for those who don't need a lot of scholarly language to entertain them.  Beware - Lovecraft's well-documented anti-Semitism comes through at several points in this book, but it never presents a problem if you can appreciate his work as an entity separate from his abysmal beliefs about this subject (like you could, say, with T.S. Eliot.)<br />Bottom line: a worthwhile investment.	2001-09-01

He follows with On Writing, the latest trump card from the artist of mass-audience literature, a memoir both of writing and his own strange life.<br />In the book, King offers sound and sage advice for people looking to break into the world of writing, following closely the exploits of a fictional author-to-be in several real-world situations, including the writing process itself, finding a market for your work, and the dreaded cover/query letter. Through it all, he remains entertaining and engaging enough so as never to bore, and the chapters on grammar are accessible to everyone, even those (like me!) who have a hard time remembering what the rules are. He also manages to slip in the hardest advice for any writer: kill your darlings, and by all means, LISTEN TO ADVICE. If only more writers could learn this (I am no exception), there would be a lot less bad poetry at coffee houses - or a lot less coffee houses, period.<br />The second part of the book is devoted to King's two personal struggles - his cocaine and alcohol addiction, and his injury and recovery after being struck by a van in 1999. Here, he changes into a wistful but analytic mode, presenting the facts but not attempting to make himself look like a saint or a victim. A refreshing change from celebrities who blame everyone but themselves for their problems - and don't bother to help themselves, either. This part moves along at a steady clip, and will certainly rival autobiographies of other authors - Nabokov's Speak, Memory comes to mind.<br />For an aspiring writer, On Writing is a sound investment. For a King fan, it is indispensable. For fun, it's worth every penny. Pick it up, give it a read - you won't be disappointed.	2001-08-31

When Stephen King collaborated with horror legend Peter Straub early in his career to create a combined horror novel, The Talisman was the dubious result. While written past King's early prime and long before his recent literary explosion, The Talisman is still awful compared to his other works around this era - and any of Straub's books. The plot will seem familiar to King and Straub readers - a young boy, Jack, must travel through an alternate fantasy reality to recover an object called the talisman to restore life to the queen of that land - who happens to be his mother's &quot;twinner,&quot; or spiritually-connected mirror image in the fantasy world. Therefore, saving the queen will save his mother's life as well. After that, the book becomes a road trip novel with some horror elements as Jack makes his way from the East to the West coast, experiencing the horrors of our world and the alternate world, from real physical dangers to corrupt, hypocritical preachers, to abusive, pedophile cops. While The Talisman's premise is a good one, it never takes off like King's great books (and Straub's, too). The reader can, in fact, tell which passages King wrote and which ones Straub wrote (they seemed to have alternated 1-for-1), and this uneven quality contributes to the book's downfall. The reader can never quite get into the story - 200 pages from the end, I had no desire to finish. I didn't really care what happened to the characters, and the story had bored me so much at that point, I just put it down and never came back. If you're looking for good King, good Straub, good horror, or good fantasy, look elsewhere. Let this one sit on the shelves as a footnote to these two author's great literary careers.	2001-08-26

The problem with people telling you about this little collection is that you often build a preconceived notion about what to expect from the work, either good, bad, or strange. If a book ever existed that should be read without any prior knowledge of it whatsoever, The New York Trilogy is it.<br />The book - really a collection of three novellas, originally published separately - follows the adventures of three different men on three different pulp-novel-style investigative cases. To give away more plot does the reader a disservice; after all, while one can describe a series of exhibits on a carnival's &quot;Freak Row,&quot; recreating the emotions involved in walking down that alley defies the conventions of language. Language, and its employ, surrounds many of the events in these books. Auster plays with the reader, offering a mystery as engaging as the ones his characters attempt to solve. He scattered the clues throughout the book, but the responsibility of creating meaning from them - and, by extension, from the book - lies solely with the reader.<br />If that seems unfair of Auster to expect of a reader, and too intellectual and highbrow for people interested in a casual experience, &quot;The New York Trilogy&quot; contains plenty more to recommend it. The mystery of meaning (provided the postmodernists and their odiously pretentious &quot;scholar&quot;-lapdogs haven't ruined such fun things for you) is an optional part of enjoying this work, and those looking for a great read should not be turned away. Vivid, haunting descriptions of The City (by all means, read this book in New York if you have the chance) mingle with stories that show an obvious awe and respect for film-noir and pulp detective stories. Hopelessness, sorrow, happiness, luck and chance, double-crossing, and redemption all combine to form three solid stories that tickle the mind. One gets the impression that Auster wrote this work almost as a tribute to the noir-pulp style, while attempting to offer the reader another mystery, should the reader desire such a challenge.<br />The seeded subcontext in the book offers quite the literary experiment, and like all experiments it doesn't always work. It usually lies in the background, suggesting its presence, but occasionally comes forward and distracts - and detracts - from the main work itself. In addition, the content matter and strange circumstances might put off those with preconceived ideas (thus, my attempt to say much while revealing little). Auster's &quot;Trilogy&quot; certainly merits a read, although it may not immediately appeal to all sensibilities.ption all combine to form three solid stories that tickle the mind.

Those familiar with George's stand-up material probably won't be surprised by what lies between these pages, but for the rest of the world, a little explanation might be necessary.<br />Carlin is, first and foremost, a linguist, like many comedians (Steve Martin being another notable example).  Delightful comedy springs from mastering language, and Carlin wields his Promethean tongue like a nuclear bomb, sparing absolutely nothing.  Is he coarse, hateful, and full of venom?  Yes.  By using words not like swords but an executioner's axe, Carlin dismembers ideas and meanings about politics, religion, history, pop culture, sports, and English itself.  His reasoning, it seems, is to throw the reader or listener so far from common meaning that the person is forced to invent - or at least reconsider - beliefs.<br />Brain Droppings contains many such aphoristic nukes.  Some are a few words long, others continue for a few pages.  There are some classics from his stand-up in here, notably &quot;Football and Baseball&quot; and &quot;A Place for my Stuff.&quot;  Unfortunately, this book really does seem like a collection of brain droppings - things that just kind of fell out of Carlin's mind.  Good or bad, there they are.  If this book has a weak point, it's that it wasn't edited very well, and some of the things in here are just plain silly and dumb.  From a man who is so obviously intelligent and humorous, I expected more at times.<br />Overall, though, does it work?  The nuke-'em-silly technique is certainly open to debate.  Will people get it?  Sometimes.  Remember, for every person that got Archie Bunker's satirical character, there were two that thought he represented a true American, and five that couldn't stomach listening to him at all.  People will find the same thing in these pages.  It's certainly worth a read; if you don't like it, one of your friends definitely will.e pages.

Neil Gaiman's &quot;American Gods,&quot; the latest literary offering from the High Priest of the English Language's Temple of Original Stories, achieves exactly this for exactly that kind of writer.  In &quot;American Gods,&quot; the author of &quot;Neverwhere&quot; and the creator of the Sandman graphic novels fashions a story that fans will find distantly familiar, and new readers will lose themselves inside within a few pages.<br />The book opens with Shadow, the main character and an almost Shakespearian anti-hero, walking out of prison to learn that his wife has died.  On the plane ride home, he meets an enigmatic con-man named Wednesday who offers Shadow a job - and a second chance at life.  With little else to do except practice coin tricks he learned in prison, Shadow reluctantly accepts and the two begin a wintery, midwestern odyssey gathering other characters together in an attempt to weather an upcoming storm.  The book follow's Shadow's travels as he discovers who he's working for, what's going on, and more about himself than he would ever want to know.<br />The journey involves dreams, altered realities, other dimensions, strange encounters, and myths and folklore from every non-American culture on the planet.  As with other Gaiman work, there is a certain amount of fun to figuring out which fantastic character Shadow is talking to - and to figuring out where the twisting plot leads next.<br />Gaiman's premise - that gods are physically created by belief and made manifest - should be familiar to fans of his graphic novels, short stories, and other work.  It is this kind of creativity that sets Gaiman apart from other authors today; his stories are as timeless as the mythologies that span cultures across the world, and yet they are original and fresh enough to engage the reader on a primal and intellectual level.  After reading books like &quot;American Gods&quot; and Gaiman's other works, one imagines he would be utterly comfortable as a bard or storyteller, weaving tales of heros around the fireplace late at night to ward off the darkness and cold outside.<br />&quot;American Gods&quot; is just as epic as these old stories, and as engaging as a new novel should be.  Gaiman is one of the most important and welcome voices in English-language literature today, although intellectual praise shouldn't put off the reader searching for a good story, because that's exactly what one will find between these covers.  &quot;American Gods&quot; is a journey of delights that I can do nothing but recommend to any reader.gh to engage the reader on a primal and intellectual level.

It's now three AM, and I jusy finished reading it cover to cover.<br />After Dachau is simply that good.<br />A fan familiar with Daniel Quinn's other works, I was pleasantly surprised to find After Dachau to be a more carefully constructed novel than books like Ishmael.  Instead of philosophy revealed through conversation, the reader is instead presented with an enormous metaphor.<br />The premise is simple: a wealthy member of the idle rich persues his dream by volunteering as a researcher at an institute that studies reincarnation.  Assigned to a case in New York, he soon finds that nothing is as it seems.<br />Those who know Quinn's views of human history will likely be able to sniff out the metaphor early on, but After Dachau is accessable even to the average reader.  Rather than a dystopic novel like &quot;1984&quot; or &quot;Brave New World,&quot; which some of the reviews seem to liken After Dachau to, this book instead forces us to examine our past, rather than be concerned about our future (although a concern for the future logially follows examination of the past!)<br />I can highly recommend this book.  It has the potential to take its place among works like &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;BNW&quot; in classrooms across the world, and it likely should be afforded such an honor.<br />Give it a read; you won't be disappointed.	2001-04-19

I have rarely been so impressed by any  book about film.  Newman provides a fantastic survey of post-nuclear,  disaster, and other &quot;apocalypse&quot; types of movies while  maintaining a scholar's approach and a likable wit.  The writing style  flows easily, and the humor helps maintain a slightly &quot;human&quot;  perspective about such grim subject matter.<br />I would highly recommend this  book to anyone interested in post-nuclear or disaster/apocalpse movies  either for fun, research, or learning.  The lists of movies, let alone the  discussion of them, make this book worth every penny.	2000-08-27

The inevitability of the characer's  demise leads them to dealing with their situation in many different ways,  each of which is realistic and thought-provoking (what would YOU do?) but  this book stands more as a study of human psychology in extreme conditions  rather than one of the truly great &quot;nuke/mass disaster&quot;  novels.<br />Shute's writing, however, is fantastic and his characters fully  believable.  The fact that the book is rather short on much except  conversation and character development sections more or less shows where  its interests lie.  This book is definately more for the intellectual  interested in the effects of impending doom on people rather than the  thrill-seeker looking for a graphic description of nuclear war.	2000-07-09

Like many other readers, this is Quinn's best book, although to call it a novel is misleading (as Quinn  himself points out in the introduction); the story is only here insofar as  it helps organize Quinn's thoughts into a logical progression and allows  the narrator's questions (which will often mirror the readers) to be  answered in time.<br />This book is very thought-provoking; even if you don't  agree with what is presented here, it will keep you awake more than one  night, mulling over various ideas until the small hours of the morning.	1999-10-17
