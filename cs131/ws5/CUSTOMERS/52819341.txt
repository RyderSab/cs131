Strolling down the cobblestone streets of San Miguel De Allende is a unique experience. From behind the unassuming whitewashed walls standing flush with the sidewalks, pierced here and there by a window adorned with a moucharabieh , one can catches glimpses of life... Music, laughs, the scent of a promising menudo  in the making, a child whose eyes will follow you down the street, a kitten napping in the sun on the window sill... <br />In this Spanish colonial town, much of life takes place out of the passer-by's sight. Following a traditional Andalucian floor plan, the rooms, linked by a colonnaded court, open around a central courtyard, or patio outfitted with a pila , and whose lush and colorful vegetation tempers the austerity of the house seen from the street... <br />Through the eye of Robert de Gast, we are ushered behind these doors to discover lush gardens, antique cantera and saltillo floors,soothing fountains and all these amazing construction details that define Spanish Colonial architecture. <br />A great book to savor, whether you are building or remodeling in the Southwest or Mexico, or you simply enjoy great photography and architecture... <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-02

Not a small feat!! <br /> <br />In her first book, novelist Patty Hill has managed to address the very personal and private topic of grieving, without sounding too mushy, languishing or pessimistic. The Catholic-girl-gone-bad that I am even enjoyed the religious bits intertwined here and there all along... <br /> <br />Her fresh, quirky writing style and her down-to-earth, warm tone left me wishing for more when I got to the last page. <br /> <br />I will be eagerly waiting for book number 2.

Initially, this book caught my eye because the story takes place in the French town where I was born and raised. <br />While I found interesting and informative to re-discover my hometown through the eyes of the writer, I was totally captured by the many sides to this book: the story about a foreigner adapting to a different culture (which I can relate  to, having made my home in the USA...), a international love story between a French man and an English woman (I am French and my husband American), the author learning to become a stepmother, the huge task of nursing back to life a beautiful property which had been abandoned by its previous owners.... <br />There are lots of stories within the main story... All so well written, I lost track of time a lot while reading this book... <br />I also, through her descriptions, recognized some of the characters!! (small town... VERY small town!!) <br />It was a true feast and I am ordering the sequel as soon as I am finished writing this review!! <br />Get this book, it will literally absorb you into its own world... Getting a glimpse of the South of France without leaving your armchair should be enticing enough... I could smell the lavender in the breeze, hear the ciccadas, and almost taste the local foods I so miss here in the US... <br />I recommend it to you all without any reservation! <br /> <br />	2004-09-27
