But the other half of his double play, the personalized reminisces of &quot;Bobby,&quot; alias him, growing up and loving girls and baseball, is basically self-agrandizement; the interesting historical observations -- and there are some --could be told within the story in Parker's as-always brilliant narrative. The Robinson character is not quite fleshed out (although it is in no way Hawk while the hero, Burke, is much like Spenser, Parker's long-running detective). No, the details in the story didn't happen but they might have. And the danger and tension surrounding Robinson were very real.<BR>     You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy this -- but you will lose little skipping the &quot;Bobby&quot; chapters.	2004-06-21

One we can understand. One we can care about. And the writing -- the patented spare, sharp Parker prose -- is as good as it gets in Spenser.<BR>   It starts with Sunny's conflicted but real relationship with her ex-husband, Richie, taking a sinking-stomach turn as Richie announces he is going to get married. Then Sunny gets involved in a case protecting a romance novelist, Melanie Joan Hall, from her ex-husband, Dr. John Melvin, a psychiatrist, a creep and a dangerous dude. In an interesting twist, Parker has Sunny go under cover as Melvin's patient -- and see an honest psychiatrist, too, as a counterbalance. Before she solves the case -- and it's creepier than one expects -- these dual sessions lead to some real psychotherapy for the resistant Sunny and a glimpse into what makes her what she is, just as we have gotten with Spenser. This makes it the most satisfying of the Sunny series so far -- and leaves the reader hungering for Book 4.<BR>    It's a fast and satisfying read.	2002-10-08

Dr. David Crane, accused of strangling his bright, black and beautiful assistant, Dr. Kalista Jordan, hides behind his top-secret genetic research when asked to explain his well known differences with the deceased. As always, Mr. Martini does the best job in the business of showing us the legal strategy of a contentious trial without talking down  and gives us examples of cross-examination that should be studied in a law schol. The dialogue is perhaps his best, the mystery is up to his usual standards - although I've come to care for his daughter Jennifer and would have liked to see more of her as she continues to grow up without a mother - there is a possibility of racism to complicate things and the surprise ending is indeed a brilliantly conceived (and fairly hinted at) surprise.<BR>    Perhaps it is a bit longer than necessary despite it's twists and needed technical explanations, but it's so good I missed half a night's sleep to finish it.	2002-07-29

Kali is particularly likeable, wearing her feelings on her sleeve, and when her good friend, Anne Bailey, is brutally murdered in a style reminiscent of the since-executed Bayside Strangler, whom Kali and Anne helped convict, there is the dual question of finding a murderer who enjoys taunting the police and finding out whether an innocent man has been convicted. Another murder quickly follows, then the killer drops a note suggesting Kali is the next victim. Kali, whose legal skills, tenacity and spunk are a lot better than her personal choices with men, straightens out everything except a budding romance which she decidedly un-straightens.<BR>    Forever or for the next book? Only Jonnie Jacobs knows.  But we eagerly await the answer, and the next book.	2002-07-29

There's the heroine, Mairead O'Clare, a talented young lawyer with lots of spunk and a physical blemish; her boss, attorney Shel Gold, a former boxer whom fate has dealt a blow to the heart; Billie Sunday, the aggressive yet motherly secretary who is raising three boys on her own; and Pontifico Murizzi, the sensitive ex-cop investigator who has his own little secret. You welcome them back and care about them even before you know what the story line is.<BR>    And it's a pretty good story line. Gold's childhood friend, the gangster Big Ben Friendman, is on trial, accused of running down a Russian immigrant boy. The Gold-O'Clare team wins an acquittal but then Juror Number Eleven on the panel is found hanged shortly after calling to say she must speak with Mairead. Again a smarting district attorney charges Friedman with the capital crime and this time evoking a not guilty verdict will not be so easy. Seldom is preparation for a trial so well laid out, and Devane is positively brilliant weaving together four individual's stories while keeping the plot moving toward a most satisfactory if unexpected conclusion. Unexpected because the clue is so subtly sewn into the fabric of the narrative that it is almost impossible to detect and thus things wind up rather abruptly. But that's only a quibble, and the only quibble.	2002-07-01

Parker, especially in his Spenser novels. The intelligence, the staccato, the bare-bones brilliance are there as always, perhaps more finely honed than ever. Widow's Walk is not his best book but it is a good one and would be worth reading for the dialogue alone if there were no plot.<BR>   But there is a plot, and a good one. Parker's client, Mary Smith, is accused of murdering her husband under circumstances that make her pretty much the only suspect. And she comes across as dumb, very dumb. Or is it dumb like a fox? As Spenser tries to find out and get to the bottom of the murder, side issues and side trails galore arise. As he follows them, the body count multiplies. He, and the reader, are in the dark almost until the very end but it's a most entertaining ride.<BR>   It's nice as this series continues to see its characters age. Pearl the wonder dog is in her final innings. Susan and Spenser have become solid and comfortable after 25 marriageless years and we get some glimpses into Susan's depth along the way in this one. The too-glib sexual innuendos are still there but the deepening of their relationship is palpable. Only Hawk is inscrutably unchanged. It's a wonderful visit with old friends, a nice, involved plot and, pardon the pun, dialogue to kill for.	2002-06-25

Yes, it starts slowly, but from about a third of the way through to the end, don't plan on putting it down. Gold, spunky, sensitive, brilliant and with a nose for things that aren't as they seem, has Angela Green, a famous woman in jail for killing her husband,  as a client. She is defending a Son of Sam case concerning a book her client is writing but a quick delving into the circumstances of the trial for her case suggests to Rachel that her client is innocent of murder. Suddenly the case she is supposed to be on becomes a backdrop as Rachel pursues hitherto unfollowed clues and inconsistencies through the murky waters of St. Louis politics and the even murkier waters of the porn industry. A lawyer could drown in such waters very easily, but our girl not only stays afloat, she emerges from them triumphant -- and even works out a thorny romantic problem of her own. Read it. Better yet, read all the Rachel Gold books and then read it; you'll appreciate it even more with such grounding.	2002-06-24

As a romance, it's a bit thin. As an adventure story, it has too open-ended an ending. And yet this is one terrific book. Mr. Demille is one heck of a story-teller.<BR>  Bringing back Paul Breener, the prickly, conscientious investigator of The General's Daughter is only the first stroke of genius here. Brenner, in an uncomfotable retirement after solving the aforementioned mystery, is lured by his old boss to return to Vietnam to solve a recently unearthed mystery in which an North Vietnamese soldier can perhaps document that at American officer killed his own enlisted man. If the Vietnamese soldier is still alive. If the he is to stay alive. If, indeed, the U.S. services and investigative bodies want the story unearthed or buried forever, along with perhaps Mr. Brenner.<BR>   His contact, the enigmatic and lovely Susan Weber, insinuates herself along each stop of his investigation as it winds dangerously Up Country, and soon becomes his lover.  But is she there to help him, spy on him or perhaps execute him?<BR>   All unfolds eventually, each incident uncovering more of Susan Weber's loyalties and where they lie, but the book is too long and too laced with the hell of war for comfort.<BR>   Still, I couldn't put it down.

The attorney she hooks up with after quitting a stuffy if prestigious job, Sheldon Gold, lives with sorrow wrapped around his heart. Their secretary, Billie Sunday, is tough, plucky, and surviving her own tragedy. Their investigator, Pontific Murizzi, is equally memorable with his own secret and his loyalty. And the defendant, Alpha, accused of murdering a fellow homeless man, is as intriguing as he is devious. This character-driven novel centers around who really committed the murder of which Alpha is accused.

Not in this exceptional and exceptionally complex legal thriller by Stephen Horn, a former Justice Department lawyer.<BR>   With the complexity of John Grisham and the flip humor of Robert Parker, Horn has crafted a memorable first novel. His protagonist, Frank O'Connell, has reversed the usual trend, starting at the top and hitting the lawyer's rock bottom of seedy , appointed-lawyer cases. He has walked out the door on a brilliant career, a top-flight Washington, D.C. firm headed by his father-in-law and a marriage to the wonderful Moira which had  produced a son he adores and sees too seldom. Suddenly in the door walks Ashley Bronson, a stunning heiress who has this little  problem: She has just shot a man to death and wants Frank to defend her.<BR>    But Frank falls in love with her and pulls out all stops to defend her in a case so complex as too seem a tad unlikely. How it all works out, and how he navigates the minefield of being in love with two women while amidst a legal minefield makes for a great read.<BR>     Please, Mr. Horn, don't quit while you're ahead but instead give us another Frank O'Connell tour de force.	2001-09-03

But let's start first with the quibbles that separate very good from great, or 5 stars from 4 stars.    This reviewer has two. The continual dirty innuendo talk with Susan (otherwise almost invisible in this book) has turned from cute to uncomfortable, and, for the third straight Parker novel, some of the villains escape justice. As he ages, is Parker just talking about sex and is he seeing the world in less certain terms?     Whatever, his writing is as brilliant as ever and his plotting in this one is very good indeed, complicated and varied.  Mary Lou Buckman, a beautiful blonde damsel in distress, comes to Spenser after her husband is murdered, she says, by a gang of outlaws terrorizing the idle rich in the getaway community of Potshot, Arizona. Spenser, drawing from his past adventures (read that novels), enlists the redoubtable Hawk and five other good-guy villains as a posse and the magnificent seven set out to clean up potshot. Of course they do and of course things aren't quite as they seem, but it's a journey you will be glad to have been along on when you reach the conclusion of this easy read.	2001-04-16

But here Burke turns things around, focusing on Harriman with Irene merely an anjunct in a story which starts slowly but catches your attention and never lets it go. The skeleton of Philip Lefebvre, 10 years gone and in disgrace with his fellow police for supposedly killing a youthful witness for money, is found in his wrecked plane and it's Harriman's case.  He quickly decides Lefebvre is innocent, and just as quickly earns the animosity of all his fellow police officers, including his superiors. It isn't any easier for Harriman when he concludes it is someone inside the police circle who must be the true murderer. In the end, he finds the mastermind, givng a boy back his name and, in an ironic twist, setting in motion the freeing of many bad guys in jail.      It's a great read, but please bring back Irene, Ms. Burke.	2001-04-15

Madriani, a widower with a young daughter, has moved to San Diego to be near the first real love interest in his life since his wife's death, Susan McKay, a child protection worker within the system. Madriani's client, Jonathan Hale, desperate to find his kidnapped granddaughter, is accused of murdering the woman who engineered her disappearance, an over-the-bend women's rights advocate named Zolanda Suade. There is tense courtroom drama (strategy brilliantly explained), an improbable shoot-'em-up in Mexico and a surprise ending. Surprising but not unfair; the clues are there, subtle but there.

A story that moves, a likeable and normal heroine, and a feel of true inside information concerning Iran and Saddam Hussein. Plus he switch3es the action like a sleight of hand artiast, leaving one aspect at its most dramatic point, creating a staccatto affect like short bursts of machine-gun fire.    C.I.A. special agent Sarah Peterson, haunted from childhood by witnessing the execution of her agent-father when she was 3, is given the plum assignment of guarding Secretary of State Jack Montgomery, who turns out to be an arch-villain. Not only has he had billionaire arms distributor Sam Baldwin's daughter kidnapped and marked for death for his own political reasons, but he was the instrument behind the death of Sarah's father.  As it all unfolds, Sarah joins with Baldwin and his top soldier, Hank Savage, against her Presidentially-given orders, and seeks to bring Montgomery down and save the Baldwin girl's life at the same time.      It's a thriller that works, a page-turner. Mr. Samuel draws heavily from his intimate knowledge of the Gulf War so one has to wonder how he will do in his second novel, on less familiar ground. His staccatto writing style suggests he will do fine and I look forward to the return of Sarah Peterson in Book 2.	2001-01-18

Little forensic brilliance, lots of angst. Dr. Kay is not her prickly but positive self but rather a haunted, hunted individual actually being accused of one of the heinous butcheries she so detests. She is a dark, Poe-esque heroine and the book is hard reading, plodding through the gloom, at parts. But for those who know and love the Scarpetta saga, to put it down would be unforgiveable. And in the end it's worth it, even if it leaves us waiting for an inevitable followup which is almost Part 2 of the book.    And it is brilliantly written, Poe-esque in that regard, too. At times passages soar. And Lucy is there, and Pete Marino and the villain we love to hate, the Werewolf.    It's heavy, too heavy. But a Scarpetta fan would not miss it.	2000-12-06

This is far more than a tennis book and, if you're looking for instruction, far less. The platform, if you'll excuse the tennis pun, is a U.S. Open final between Clark Graebner and Arthur Ashe, but it is a study of two men and what brought them to this point, athletically but especially sociologically. The reflective Southerner forced to be a pioneer because he is black. The more rigid son of the Midwest and privilege, with greater power and less versatility. The vagaries that make them human: Graebner, the more up-tight, gambling with a prepared point successfully at a crucial spot in the match. And at the end, there is Ashe, triumphantly whistling a winner off his suspect backhand to close out the match. You want to cheer.

In fact, I was amazed to see it was numero uno. Even Robert Parker, another mystery master, took one novel to get it right.  Francis, in racetrack parlance, broke from the gate fast. All the elements are there: A likeable hero who pursues the truth at great personal risk; a sweet but never turn-the-page-torrid romance with a bend in the road; outside knowledge about an interesting field, and an interesting villain one can almost sympathize with on some level. It grabs you right away with the murder of a jockey during a race and never lets go, right to the surprising conclusion -- one, incidentally, which our hero desperately wanted not to be so. Enjoy. It's a great start to a great, long ride. Francis' first and one of his best.	2000-10-29

As Shattered clearly shows, the powers of a super-nova of the thriller genre are continuing on the wane. All the familiar Francis elements his fans -- and I am one of them -- have long loved are here. The eminently likeable hero. The mystery with a racetrack tie-in. The beatings the hero must endure. The softly sweet romance. And an offbeat field of interest, in this case glass-blowing. The glass blowing stuff is fascinating.  Unfortunately, it is more fascinating than the slow-moving, improbable plot, spelled out with greater detail than the characters of the mystery. I guess we care about Gerard Logan, our virtuoso glass-blower and hero, but not with the depth of heroes of former Francis novels. And the romance with his policewoman is stated rather than felt. Even Francis' deft little touches which subtly show two people developing a love for each other are muted. This is Francis lite.	2000-10-12

Rather this, Sunny's second case, is itself more a series of studies of the varied and tortured physical relations women get into. There's the radical feminist who's a lesbian with a heterosexual itch to scratch; the former prostitute who drifted from respectable married life to lesbian promiscuity; the unhappy wife who deserts her husband and children to find herself; and the overly dependent wife who discovers her husband is cheating and strikes out on her own, a role for which she is singularly unqualified. Then there's Sunny herself, enjoying a perfectly good relationship with the man she's divorced. Somewhere along the way, three people get murdered because of the dirty little complications in the first two relationships above. That the last two confused women are Sunny's best friend and sister adds to the intrigue. But it also adds to the confusion as Sunny hops from emotional problem to emotional problem while trying to solve a well disguised mystery, knowing solving it could also be fatal. It works, well sort of, only because of Parker's genius with sparse prose and clipped, incisive dialogue. And because the heroine is so damn likeable. Still, it's not fully satisyfing and, as he did in Hugger Mugger, Mr. Parker's ending is also unsatisfyingly unresolved. Parhaps as he grows older, Mr. Parker is trying to tell us that the black and white of the young Spenser's world hardly exists. If that's the message, it doesn't quite work. Sort of like this novel.	2000-10-03

There were glimpses of greatness amid a lot of pedestrian stuff. Ditto this book. Spenser's sharp dialogue is there, but not honed as it is in later books. But the plot is pedestrian, college and the rebellion scene, and there's no Hawk and no Susan to help broaden the interest and spice up the dialogue. Parker makes a quantum leap in God Save the Child, putting it almost all together at his current level in Book 2.  I had read many Spencers before I located this beginning novel. Like the Hopper sketches, its greatest interest is in the glimpses of the genius to come. But if this had been my first Spencer read, I might never have gone on to the pleasure of the rest of them.	2000-09-29

Taking on the age-discrimination suit of her mother's  friend leads to a captain of industry with swastikas in his past and, with  her oddball friend Prof. Benny Goldberg and his legal-research irregulars  on the case, Rachel parries all the legal roadblocks a multimillion-dollar  legal staff can throw at her in unraveling a long-buried puzzle. This sets  up an unforgettable and unforgettably dramatic courtroom confrontation. And  woven throughout the fabric are a reverent look at the suffering of the  Jews, even in the United States, before World War II. And, oh, yes, there's  a sweet, growing romance, too.

The myriad plots and subplots in this book, basically a  whodunnit about a nasty but rich doctor and the poor little poor girl  accused of his murder, are satisfying and the story is rich in characters  and character development.  It has bothered me in earlier books that Nina's  relationship with her son Bob and her dual role as provider and single  parent have been given only cursory coverage; here there is satisfyingly  more. And, picking up from the denoument of the last book in the series,  the issue of when, if ever, it is right to take the law into one's own  hands and the effect of doing so on an individual is explored. And the  resumption of an on-again, off-again romatic tie is very welcome.     Overall, the book is tremendously satisfying...but, there are buts. Nina's  hunch at the end seems a bit far-fetched, though it solves the case. And  the italicized beginnings, meant to focus on an individual's struggle with  taking the law into his own hands, detract from the flow of the plot by  diverting focus. They would be better covered within the body of the novel.     Those quibbles aside, I can't wait for the next Nina Reilly story.	2000-08-20

In fact, it's a natural. Graphically, the opening scene is scary in reading and would be  even moreso visually. The story is clever, intricately woven, with enough  false leads to keep everyone guessing, and ends with a satisfying  confrontation between Rachel and a surprising prime villain preceded by a  life-and-death chase through the underground tunnels of old St. Louis --  again, something that would work even better darkly seen in a movie than a  book. But the book works, oh, does it work. There is a sweet romance with a  tragic ending for our heroine and, for a bit of lightness, a couple of  memorable softball moments. The vallainy hinges on someone actually trying  to do some good at its start, another ends-justify-the-means moral issue.  And Rachel's closing confrontational comment: &quot;You've destroyed enough  universes for a lifetime&quot; is the most satisfying resolution, morally  and structurally. I can't wait for the movie, Mr. Kahn.	2000-06-06

O.K., so the detective is a female and the sidekick is gay and the setting is Boston and there's a dog in the picture and a woman-at-the-edge being rescued has a familiar ring, but Sunny Randall is not quite Spencer with a  sex-change operation. And Parker's prose is so pristine that maybe it  wouldn't matter. But for a tough-guy (but sensitive) author who writes  about a tough guy (but sensitive) detective to try things from a feminine  perspective and pretty much get it right is both an accomplishment and  worth a tip of the hate from a longtime Spenser fan. Much of the working  out of the story does seem familiar but it still is well worth the read. I  understand there's to be a second Sunny Randall and I can't help wonder:  Will the young woman she saves in her first story and has arranged to see a  good psychologist end up going to Susan Silverman?	2000-05-14

They are well written, loaded  with authentic material and have truly puzzling mysteries to unravel. Throw  in an irresistible, spunky main character and it's quite a nice package (as  is Rachel Gold). While the fifth and so far final novel, Sheer Gall, is  Kahn's best, Grave Designs is the start of it all. And a fine start it is.  A complex story with a plot that reaches back to Colonial New England and a  brainy heroine struggling with her own emotions and a nefarious criminal  organization are the basis of the absorbing story. Plus there is one light  touch that I just love. Rachel greets an old law-school friend with a flip  &quot;You mean you made bail on the morals charge?&quot; and he replies  &quot;The sheep would never testify against me!&quot; Ah, insouciance. Ah,  breezy dialogue.	2000-05-07

It integrates all the familiar Spenser characters from earlier novels, even Rachel Wallace, sheds further light on the relationship with Hawk, and, most especially, on that with Susan Silverman, which is the subject of the esoteric title. It shows Spencer sensitive and suffering over the woman he loves, seems satisfying psychologically to me, although I'm not sure Susan would act quite as she did. But that's a quibble. This is Parker at his best, Spenser at his height, and a good, rip-roaring, cross-country adventure story to boot. I like God Save the Child and Mortal Stakes and Early Autumn and Small Vices very much. But if I had to take one Spenser book with me on a long, boring journey, this would be it.	2000-03-12
