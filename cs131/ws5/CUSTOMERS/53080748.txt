This is a logical, cogent discourse on attitudes that have developed throughout the Western world in the past fifty years.  In essence, it is a paean to the concept of FREE WILL.  Mankind has the ability, in the decisions he or she makes, to do what they want, and to control their feelings and actions.  This may be a difficult concept for some people who would rather deny free will, and blame others, or sickness, or an unknown force or a divinity.  But in the end, it is the individual who has control. <br /> <br />In particular Chapter Four, Emotional Correctness, drives this point home in a believable, thoughtful, and convincing manner.  This book is not from the right or from the left, it is from the mind and hopefully enough people will read it and act on it for the betterment of our personal, professional and collective lives. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-24

As a novel, this is an exciting page-turner with hints of truth and credibility that seem to make sense, like his Jurassic Park.  But incredible coincidences and sleights of hand creep in, and much of the credibility is lost.  As a statement about the abuse of science, the book is a classic.  It should not be viewed as left or right, environmentalist or anti-environmentalist.  It is a lesson in the importance of truth.  The scientific method of inquiry depends on truths, and too often politics get in the way. <br /> <br />In the medium in which this book is immersed, the possibility of catastrophic environmental effects, it is clear that there are organizations who must maintained a State of Fear to keep themselves going, whether or not the truth justifies their conclusions or their actions. <br /> <br />This is an excellent book, with more to say on integrity than about anything else, and that is framed in a fast paced story that keeps the reader's attention and says something worthwhile to the reader at the same time. <br />	2005-07-24

It takes place at the time that Plato started his Academy, and there are references to him both personally and in descriptions of his institution.  The murder mystery deals with the kind of reasoning that is most familiar in the fictional detectives Hercule Poirot or perhaps Sherlock Holmes.  And then there is the mysterious recognition of a modern day translator that he is actually inserted into this millennia-old text.    In all, I found the book unsatisfying.  The conclusions were not complete and left a lot (too much) for the reader to figure out.  With all the novelty of the read, it was very trying.	2005-07-14

Although there are some highly-incredible moments in the book, such as a submarine picking up a tap-tap-tap signal in the middle of the Arctic, and there is a question of whether all the science is actually science or pseudo-science, that didn't matter. The book was an excellent read, and there was enough logic and action in it to keep one's interest, and to keep one turning the pages.  I thought that it was a much better read than the iconoclastic Da Vinci Code and it's formulaic Angels & Demons.  This book has a beginning, middle and end that was complete, and satisfying, something missing from these other two books.	2005-07-04

It deals with the agony of a man who has had a tremendous loss, in a spouse and in his homeland.  Although he spent decades in the USA, his homeland is still Italy, and as soon as he returns there he, and the rest of us, knows that he re-discovered his home, and now knows where he should be.  His cycling was a good back-drop and added to the continuity of the story.  The ending, although anticipated, seems a little far fetched, but perhaps not for the characters in the story.	2005-07-04

This history is presented in an interesting, informative, and exciting manner, and should be mandatory not just for New Yorkers but for all American students as well.

Many of the columns were interesting . . . painting a picture of a vast right-ring conspiracy that Hillary Clinton first brought to the public discourse.  But it seems that most of these pieces are obsolete, without any interest either as themselves or as a theme.  Does anyone care about Texas state politics in 1989, or Phil Gramm's problems as a senator or as a presidential candidate?  Someone should have gone through this and culled out what was obsolete .. except that that would probably have left less material than would make up a book.

It was difficult to understand the author's great admiration for this man.  He said that Grant knew that the North was so much more populous than the South that even if they lost 10,000 men to the South's 5,000 at every battle, the South would not be able to keep up these losses and would lose, by attrition.  Apparently Grant's priority was not the soldiers under his comand but a near-manic determination to avoid retreat.    On almost every page the author makes note of Grant's inability to handle even the simpliest of financial transactions, and held long standing grudges agains people who had slighted him.  He dismisses Grant's General Order 11, which kicks Jews out of Grant's sphere of influence (which was reversed by Lincoln as soon as he heard about it), with some kind of psychobabble about his own relationship with his father.    If dogged determination were the only criteria for office, then this would be a Great Man and a Hero, but that was all Grant had, and it was just not enough.  He won the war, but the author leaves open the question of whether it could have been won with much less loss of Northern soldiers' lives.    It seems as if the Author feels obliged to say something great about a person whom he convinces himself is great, but what comes across is a man with a very, very narrrow field of competence, with failures upon failures away from the battlefield.  It was an illuminating story of Grant, but I thought that it was far from complimentary and far from what the author was hoping to convey.	2005-03-08

In my opinion, this book tries to do two things: note the correct vs. incorrect use of punctuation and impress upon the reader (or rather the writer) the importance of adhering to a standard of language that will clarify one's meaning. As far as correct vs. incorrect usage, the book creates no end of confusion.  It quotes from one novelist or playwright to another, goes back in time to the origin of certain punctuation norms, and tells us about English vs. American usage.  It shows so many variations in usage, and excuses so much of these variations, that what comes through is that there is really no absolute standard for the English language.  But on the second point, relating punctuation to clarity, she is right on.  While some of her examples seem just plain silly (has anyone ever seen confusion between a comma and an apostrophe) her point comes across to me as: pay attention to punctuation and use it with logic and deliberation. <br /> <br />I don't understand why she has to include a paean to herself in her Foreword . . that is just plain rude to the reader, who has already purchased the book, and who should be able to make up his/her own mind about how great the author is.	2005-02-17

Apparently the entire history of the Balkans is really a history of religious strife, between Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Catholics and Muslims.

This is an excellent chapter written with clarity, and with relevant examples, which should be lifted out of the book and given publicity to counter false protestations of moral equivalence of the acts of a free society vs. acts in a fear society.  The rest of the book seems to be an expansion of King's LETTER FROM A BIRMINGHAM JAIL where the authors argue for strict moral requirements, mainly the institution of the democratic process, to be part of any relationships that we may have with what they call the \\"fear societies.\\"  Half-hearted measures would do nothing but keep the status quo, as King argued in his letter.

The book starts out with an exploration of attitudes towards Jews in America, which is a reflection of attitudes towards these people in other parts of the world at that time in history.  It takes a turn in a questionable direction when it shows most of the American people acquiescing in this attitude, under the guise of avoiding war in Europe.  Were the American people ever this complacent, or racist, or stupid, in the way Roth presents them?  In the last hundred pages of the book, he rushes through the unlikely scenario where he presents the PLOT AGAINST AMERICA, and winds up with the American people doing a U-turn in their attitudes.  This change is not fully explained, and is handled in a very superficial, almost unintelligible manner.  Roth's description of Jewish life in a Jewish neighborhood is interesting, as well as his presentation of the extended Roth family, but his plot leaves something to be desired.  It seems that he rushed through the ending of the book, to make it palatable and neat, nevermind that it doesn't make much sense in light of the attitudes presented in the rest of the book.  His presentation of the Lindberghs is ambivalent, and we are left with a question of whether they were willing or unwilling participants in the views that they espoused.  History is not quite that charitable towards them.  This is not a very good work.	2005-01-16

This is a good review of the history of the Israeli-Palestinian issue.  It addresses the problem from both sides, and from the side of the Arab world also.  Some of his assertions are particularly interesting, including the apparent fact that there were no Palestinians before Israel became a possibility after the Balfour declaration . . . until then these people were just Arabs.  His solutions to the problem left something to be desired.  Essentially he says that there is no solution to the conflict, and presents measures which are contradictory to one of his theses.  He notes that when push comes to shove, a population will favor social issues over economic ones, however his solutions are basically economic solutions.  He should have given the same level of thought to solutions to this problem as he did to the origins of the problem between the Israelis and the Palestinians.	2005-01-13

The book was written in an amateurish fashion, with exaggerations and irrelevant tales and overly dramatic descriptions.  In particular the descriptions of the perils of deep diving seemed to be included on every page of the book.  I am now convinced that deep diving is dangerous, enough already.  The sympathy for the German crew and for their families is another issue that I had with the book. These people were coming to our shores to attack our ships, many of which were non-combat ships.  Their purpose was to instill terror in Americans, particularly those who lived along the coast.  And many of these sailors volunteered for this duty.  They knew that there was a good chance that they would die, so why did they volunteer . . so they could kill as many Americans as they could?  Sympathy for them is misplaced, I would think.  On the positive side, the book does illustrate the types of people who go in for deep diving, and the reasons for it.  The reasons seem to be, for the most part, a bit short of admirable.  For most of these guys it is a macho-buddy trip (although a woman was included on some of the dive trips), an excuse for wild and obnoxious behavior, both on the sea and at get-togethers on land.  If, like me, you know nothing about this kind of life, it would be an interesting read to get a small taste of it, but this all that I can say about it as a worthwhile read.	2005-01-07

Much of this book is a rehash of Sumerian legend from Gilgamesh and biblical stories from Genesis and Exodus, without getting into the unique characteristics of the Jews that made them so important to present civilization.  Eventually he does get into the subject, but in such a peripheral way that he seems to be straining to try to make his argument.  He should have concentrated more on those aspects of Judaism that have truly shaped the west (and he says the undeveloped world also, but that seems to be a real stretch) rather than try to show us that he has read the Old Testament and various versions of Gilgamesh.  There is much less to this book than would appear,  and his gee-whiz style starts to grate on the reader, at least on this reader.	2004-12-23

This was a contrived, jumbled, nonsensical tale with a protagonist who could not possibly be believed.  Going back in time through a so-called Buddhist technique to discover places and incidences that he could not possibly have known in real time, and interacting with people in this dream is just one of the inane avenues in this book.  His superhuman abilities to take care of shattered flesh is also absurd.  Another was the way the book ended where the bad guy just happened to be destroyed at just the right time by something resembling an act of God.  Why mention a real building, The Dakota, while fictionalizing the American Museum of Natural History, and giving it a non-existent address.  So many stereotypical characters, such as the kindly and competent but insensitive reporter, an antagonist with superhuman strength, the dumb cop, etc.  Very sloppy.  And the ending, the reason for the original bad guy to have done what he did, made no sense at all.

The brothers witnesses such unbearable cruelty at the hands of the Germans and many local gentiles that they saw no choice but to fight if they were going to survive.  Their fight included their protection of hundreds and hundreds of Jews.  Through their charisma, organizing skills, and aggressiveness, they successfully accomplished their task. Along the way, however, it appears that they developed a certain hubris, a feeling of such self-importance that they became what can only be called tyrannical.  Although there is a question of whether they or some of their people were unduly robbing the surrounding peasants and appeared less than completely with their Soviet sponsors, there is no question that they took what ever they wanted for themselves, including accommodations and women.  Perhaps as with Moses, Tuvia committed such a cruel act upon the dissolution of the camp that he paid for it by becoming a failure in later life, never able to re-capture his former authority and self-satisfaction.	2004-12-08

Nothing positive is coming out of imperialism as practiced in the Congo as Conrad shows it . . . the native population is portrayed as practically sub-human, with their societies untouched by the Europeans.

The narrator is the only one who has compassion for these people, except for Kurtz at the end of his life who, looking back on what he has done, exclaims the horror, the horror.  Conrad takes the imperialist society of the late eighteenth century to its extremes and shows how shallow it all is.  But this story has greater application.  It shows how human beings can be reduced to sub-human beings by members of the \\"superior\\" spociety.

Did that dinner really happen, and what was the truth about the actual duel?  This book would have had more significance if he included, from the wealth of material available on our early days, only those stories that are true.  He did show the humanity between the six seminal figures in our history, although it is not clear whether that makes them more or less of the giants we consider them today.	2004-08-31

A pleasant and easy to read story with the obligatory bad local boy, poor black matriarch with the wisdom of Solomon and all her children having become professionals, the initially distrusted \\"Northerner\\" from Tennessee, the drunk who can write a good story, and the former reporter, an eccentric who had a thing about obituaries.

It is ironic that the Prince for whom this book was written never read it . . . but so much of the rest of the world has read it.  But apparently not enough people have applied its principles.  This is the way to obtain and retain power, or success.  The Iraqi army was disbanded, in spite of Machiavelli's warning to keep them intact to obtain a base in a conquered territory.  In Afghanistan the Army is ensconced in compounds rather than mixing among the people, another Machiavelli recommendation to show the humanity of the occupier and their desire to work with, rather than be superior to the population.  So much of what is happening today, so much that is wrong can be traced to not taking Machiavelli's advice.  This is perhaps the most useful book ever written.	2004-08-31

Andrew knew what was right, and how to live in a manner that complimented goodness and morality.  He was a diverse thinker, saving an apparent stillborn, changing a woman's diet to eliminate a severe rash rather than apply worthless creams, and he knew the meaning and the worth of being a good medical practitioner.  The issue is that when he knew what he should do, and took another path, his punishment would be severe.  It would be more severe than if, like those around him, he was not aware of the correct path and went about in ignorance and with avarice, there would be no such punishment.  Punishment is based on doing wrong when you know you are doing wrong.  This is a wonderful story with a strong treatment of morality, with descriptions of life in Britain, saying something about the bureaucracy, which deals with professional competence, incompetence and jealousy.  It is a universal story despite the archaic terms and language that are used.	2004-08-30

There have always been people who decry current trends, which they see as bringing on disaster.

In spite of all the protestations, America is still the guiding light of the world, offering its people a better life and more opportunity than anywhere else on earth, and life only gets better in spite of the efforts of some to move it in another direction.

US	53080748	RFVS3N3EJKNU	0670032115	108824701	The Peloponnesian War	Books	5	7	11	N	N	Real Insights!	There is so much here.  The Greeks must have been very prosperous, or else they could not afford to spend so much of their time fighting.  It appears that their main activity was fighting each other, and there were very many City-states involved, at odds with one another as well as with Sparta and Athens.  There is a tremendous sense of personal responsibility.  Every action of the Athenian generals and politicians was rigorously examined, judged, and if found wanting the man in question was exiled, put to death, or given some other form of punishment.  When one considers the fighting, it must be remembered that there was no gunpowder, and no long bow.  Most of the fighting was hand-to-hand combat, which puts a completely different dimension on warefare, stressing training, disipline, physical strength and the like, and with particular emphasis on heroism in the field as opposed to running away from a fight.  Not infrequently a Greek General was killed because he was there with his troops.  Quite a difference from today when a war is fought in Afganistan or Iraq by Generals thousands of miles away, in Tampa, without even the pretense of being at one with the men they are sending out to face the possibility of death.<br />There are different features of democracy that are illustrated in this history.  The indecision, the susceptibility to popular will (like the killing of the Generals after they supposedly failed to rescue downed sailors or retrieve their dead), general stupidity (the invasion of Sicily).  Also, the mercurial nature of their decisions, as well as the stubborn lack of change in direction . . these are conflicting actions, but both are present from one campaign to the next.  No doubt the Oligarchies were not much better.  This points to the government we have in the USA, as the recipient of that prior history ... implying that the ancients must have been studied in depth by Jefferson, Madison and the others of our founders, and thanks to the influenceof the Greeks and recognition of their mistakes, we here in the USA wound up with a better government than the Greeks or anyone else has ever had.<br />Throughout this book I was thinking of Machiavelli and how the Greeks could have used his insights.  Particularly with Alcibiades, who went from one side to another . . old Noccolo would never have sanctioned bringing him back, or the widespread use of merenaries . . if these people could be bought, then they could be bought by either side.  Machiavelli must have been very familiar with the ancient Greeks because so much of the Prince seems to have originated with the mistakes made by both Athenians and Spartans.<br />This is a book in the Tuchman mold, very much reminiscent of Guns of August in the presentation of the historic context for actions, delving into personalities of the players, and putting the entire action in an appropriate and understandable context.<br />This text gives real insights into a period of history unknown to so many, and should be required reading for anyone in a position of leadership, or aspitring to leadership in this country . . to see what came before, and its true relevance to todays events.  I remember quotes from Kennedy and Clinton regarding this period of history, but I can't imagine anyone in the present administration who knows more about Attica or Pelopennesia than the quality of their olives.	2004-02-27

Whatever it was, the lives of a community were changed and the dreams of two families went up in smoke.  One of them found a way to continue their lives, but for the other family, they spiraled into a life of emotional poverty.  The frightening lesson in this book is that it is hard to imagine that any of us would be immune to this disaster.  It could probably happen to practically anyone, and just its possibility opens up the fact of our vulnerabilities.  It made me think that I was on a precipice or a knife edge, facing disaster with just a misstep as I tried to go about my daily, routine tasks.	2004-02-16

Unfortunately, there is little in the book relating the Greeks to modern life, very few instances of why the Greeks really matter to us.  It is an interesting discussion of the Athenians but virtually nothing about the many other Greek City-States, including Sparta, was included, and these other polis are no less important in defining Ancient Greek society as the Athenians. How did the oligarchs and kingdoms abounding in the Aegean two millennia ago affect future history?  Is there an element of Sparta in present day governance, or in other aspects of life today?  What were the differences in the various Greek States and why did democracy lose out among these various other systems?  Is it true that the Athenians virtually argued themselves to death through their democratic processes and were they more successful when they turned, although briefly, to oligarchic rule?  This could have been a much better book.	2004-02-16

Many of the people dealt with are pure charlatans, and others are undisguised demagogues, and this is an intelligent, witty expose of them.  In total, Franken lays bare the fact that there are people who will do anything to attract attention, without any regard for honesty.  One of the most telling anecdotes is that of Dick Cheney, who has to pretend to have a sense of awe and patriotism when referring to Arlington National Cemetery, when he didn't have a clue as to what markers are placed over the graves.  What a phony.  This should not be dismissed as a Liberal/Conservative tome; it is an honest look at people in public life who are trying to grab attention through an undeserved podium.  One has to be reminded of Lincoln's . . . you can't fool all of the people all of the time . . . and wonder when these people will be getting their due. <br />The only deficiency in the book . . . what does one do about the problem of dishonesty in the media and in Government . . hopefully that will be another book by this very talented humorist.	2004-02-15

Even within the morality in 1961 (apparently forbidding the mention of sexual preference in an acknowledged hero, which resulting in omission of what must have been a major formative issue in his life) this is a compelling story of the rise of one of the few peole in the art world whose work is as vibrant today as when it was produced over 500 years ago.  Michelangelo was constantly under pressure to comply with the whims of others, Medici or Pope, and even the works he had no interest in, his creative ability shone through.  His fear of being caught in his forbidden studies of cadavers, suffering through those terrible winter months, dealing with the arbitray whims of his patrons, his genius shone through despite himself.

He is a good-hearted young man who tries to make a go of it, but, as Stella says, falls into the whims and desires of so many people he meets.  He is taken along on a trip to smuggle people form Canada, goes along with his brother's whims and practically marries a woman chosen for him, goes to the shore with an employer, who wants to adopt him, runs off to Mexico with a strange woman and her eagle, ends up in Europe with yet another woman he doesn't say no to, and finds that marriage is less than he would have wanted.  He doesn't seem to be able to take control of his own life.  Undoubtedly there are many people like this, good hearted with a streak of innocence, but winding up with something less than success.  And throughout the book one can see Bellow's disenchantment with rampant Capitalism, which is evident with the successful men in Augies experiences.  I like Augie, and I sympathize with him.
