There is nothing special here, hackneyed plotline, flat dialog, cookie cutter characters...many fantasy books out there similar to it written by 43 year olds.  If your looking for safe, reliable, predictable fantasy plotlines than this book is for you and you will enjoy it otherwise save your money.	2005-09-02
US	52999638	R37KU5EMW4L7PM	0670033634	333083668	The Memory of Running: A Novel	Books	3	9	14	N	N	Moderate view	I enjoyed this book but didn't think it was good or bad.  There is a defined difference in the writing and characters compared to \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" and \\"The Shipping News\\" as the review aboves compares this novel.  Those are books about people who happen to be quirky and odd.  This book is just a book about an akward person.  The author just tries too hard.  From the name of the main character \\"Smithy\\" to the continous first person references to Smithy's obesity and odd scenes of his life.  It just doesn't seem to work somehow.  One thing that doesn't make sense also is the book is written in first person and somehow he tells you about things from his sister and neighbor's point of view that he just couldn't really realistically have known.  If your a fan of John Irving's works (the quirkiest of the quirky) then you may not like this book.  Overall I mildly enjoyed it but might recommend you get it from the library.	2005-03-11

We enjoyed most of the hotels recommended in Northern Italy and Tuscany but found that numerous American travelers carry this book. (We were sitting at a small restaurant in Montepulciano and observed that all 7 tables including our own were Americans and 4 tables had folks reading Rick Steve's Book)  It makes it difficult to get a room less than 30 days in advance...at least some of the more moderately priced hotels.  I found some of the restaurants and hotels sufferred from what I call \\"Rick Steves Syndrome\\"  where many Italians associated seemed to have overdosed on tourism and Americans.  What was once the \\"Backdoor\\" is now the front door. That said, it is an essential part of travel to Italy, expecially when you're on a schedule and want to maximize your sightseeing. Just dont rely on it 100 percent to solve your lodging and dining needs while in Italy.	2004-11-17

This is definitely a journal of almost every day Bill Schuette has on the AT. This is a nuts and bolts type of story, telling you about almost every part if the trail and what it takes and what it's like to do it.  I have read books that generalize large parts of the trail and spend more time on the spiritual, philosophical part of why they are doing the trail but this is not it.  I think I enjoyed this as much as others is I got to hear about parts of the trail that most books seem to skip and it is a timely account from the year 2000.  Another is he finishes the trail unlike Bill Bryson's fractional account, \\"A Walk in the Woods\\"<br /><br />I recommend Mic Lowther's book, \\"Walking North\\" for a nice combination of trail accountability and philosophy.	2004-08-28

I have read most of the Sharpe series by Bernard Cornwell.  I have mostly found them a good read being a fan of historical fiction.  I was hesitant to read a book on &quot;Aurthurian England&quot; for I have found the hackneyed legends sorrounding Aurthur's myth tiresome.  But WOW this is an incredible novel that brings to life a possible historical basis of this sparsely documented time in British history.  It is a rich and exciting portrayal of Arthur and plausible explanations of the people and events that brought about the legend of Excalibur.  I must say it is the best of his novels I have read so far and am excited about continueing with the series.  I have found that those who have not enjoyed this book have been looking for a fantasy novel of a traditional sense about Avalon etc.  This is not it.	2003-11-03

I find when you use books like this one, you really only feel they sent out questionairres to businesses then selected a few without really feeling out what makes a good hotel for some and a bad restaurant for others.  The lack of any map detail as they describe locations will make you buy another guide book to see what may be in the vicinity of a particular hotel and attraction anyway.  So I would stick to Fodor's or Frommer's and get a book to augment it, not this one.	2003-01-10

A great adventure from one of the first motorcycle adventurers. His tales are genuine and his connections with the people in the countries he visits are real.  What I find refreshing is he is a sincere person with real anxieties and doubts.  He doesn't hide his fears and lays it on the line.<br />To comment on previous reviews.  I did not find his observations that he was God or Jupiter bothersome. He was only commenting in the context of his long period on the road and did not detract from the book.	2002-10-22

They say life is a journey well for Helge Pedersen that is literally true.  What I especially liked about this book is that he has a truly realistic look at the countries he is traveling and lives and works with the locals to get to know them better.  He takes risks that I would never be comfortable with but I can enjoy reading about them from the comfort of my living room.  The only negative is the price of the book but you have to expect that I guess with the color photos etc.	2002-08-20

It's a good read however there are some observations.<br />-Andres relationship with his riding partners seem dubious.  He seems to be that irresponsible roommate that you had in college and it is highly interesting that he doesn't tell you Robert's last name or where he is from like he does with Peter.  If Robert is his real name, why after spending months with Andres would he not want to be identified?<br />-He claims to have little money and a poor college student but has 10's of thousands of dollars worth of gear, equipment and resources and he worries little about rent, hotels until the very end. Did his trust fund run out?<br />-He parties like he is on spring break from one end of the continent to the other.<br />-He is constantly perturbed by the locals.  Why travel to a foreign country only to be frustrated by the natives.<br />All and all, it is an adventure worth reading although the writer is not entirely likable.  I recommend &quot;10 years on 2 Wheels&quot; for a truely amazing rider and adventurer, Helge Pedersen.<br />To qualify some previous comments.  I observed numerous spelling/grammatical mistakes in this book.  The publisher should consider hiring better editors.	2002-08-19

So as an avid sci-fi reader I found the basic idea very fascinating.<br />That is where it ends.  The scientific theories etc. in the book are well thought out and presented very well but the characters are extremely one dimensional and for intelligent people, their quests for the truth are nonsensical.  Why read chapters in a book when it adds nothing new to the story and does not move the plotline along?<br />The ending of a book is obviously very important.  No matter how intriguing the rest of the book has been, you have to get it right.  Robert J. Sawyer's attempt to be profound fails miserably and it just ends up being corny.<br />Buy this one at a garage sale.	2002-06-27

Finally publishing it for the public in 2001. I am sorry he did not do it sooner.  After virtually reading every account that has been written about walking all the trail or in part, this book is my favorite.<br />  It seems that they are careful not to mention actually when his family walked the trail but I would guess in the mid 1970's.  It is an excellent balance of what the trail is about, the emotions that ensue and the personal relationships that develop between hikers and their immediate family.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who has dreamed of hiking the trail or mystified why people actually attempt it.	2002-06-03

It may have been the time period between the second book and when the third got published.  I found this trilogy better than most fantasy out there today, though it seemed to flounder and become confused as if the author was not sure how to end it or come to a climax.

He does this for two more nights without finishing this incredible tale. Then you wake up on the fifth morning to find your Uncle's gone home without telling you when he'll be back.<br /><br />These stories are fantastic but after waiting for the next novel to come out and have it delayed for over a year, the frustration level mounts. The plot lines are complicated enough that I will probably have to go back and read some of the novels again and that's no small feat for 800+ page books.<br /><br />With the time investment of these novels, it might be best to wait till all are published before reading for once you've started, you will be running to the bookstore for the next installment.<br /><br />_________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />After reading Science Fiction and Fantasy for 30 years I thought I had exhausted my search for a well written fantasy book that wasn't the SAME plotline over and over and over!  \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is well crafted and has intrigue that will keep you with this book to the very end.
