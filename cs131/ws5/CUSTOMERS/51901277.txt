Scott Fitzgerald's second novel, Anthony Patch is what the protagonist of Fitzgerald's debut \\"This Side of Paradise\\" would have become had he been allowed to grow up without the wizening experiences Amory Blaine suffers.  But, though older and richer than Amory, Anthony truly suffers more; in fact, following his alcoholic downward spiral creates a great deal of suffering in the reader, even as the prose is lovely and the characterizations full.  At least Anthony (and the reader) has the stunning Gloria Gilbert to accompany him on that cirrhotic journey.<br />Anthony and Gloria would have fit right in among the Bright Young Things of Fitzgerald's English contemporary Evelyn Waugh's more satirical, far less meaty novels of callous behavior and insincere rich people.  Fitzgerald's characters are sincere, however--sincere about expecting that the world should fall at their feet forever, and that earning their way by honest toil isn't the way to go about it.  This book is a tale of a destructive marriage in which neither party is more at fault than the other, and in which the greatest sin of both is narcissism (though despair is often not far off as the story moves along).<br />You've got to hand it to Gloria, though: feminists and individualists of all stripes and sexes will appreciate her paean to self-actualization:<br />\\"What grubworms women are to crawl on their bellies through colorless marriages!  Marriage was created not to be a background but to need one.  Mine is going to be outstanding.  It can't, shan't be the setting--it's going to be the performance, the live, lovely glamorous performance, and the world shall be the scenery.  I refuse to dedicate my life to posterity.\\"<br />Wouldn't it be fun to listen to this woman tell stories if she lived to be 80?<br />For all its beauty, \\"The Beautiful and Damned\\" can wear the reader down.  It's too long, for one thing, and Anthony and Gloria keep repeating the same mistakes long after Fitzgerald has established that they are the kind of people who don't learn from their mistakes.  Fitzgerald fans should definitely give it a try, and if it wears on you by the middle of the book then you should feel no guilt about letting it sit for a while.  I should also add that the first seven pages are as enticing an opening as any I've read in an American novel.  Every era needs its portraits in fiction, and the 1920s belong to Fitzgerald.	2002-12-08

(Lord Peter Wimsey Mysteries)	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Let Her Whimsy Take You	\\"Whose Body?\\" is the first Lord Peter Wimsey novel written by Dorothy Sayers in the 1920s, and was the second I read after \\"Gaudy Night.\\"  As someone who generally likes to read series in order, I still have to say it was fun knowing the type of put together gentleman that Lord Peter will become even as I enjoyed reading of his casual manner and clever impulsiveness in his first big fully-recorded case.<br />Lord Peter must figure out what happened to a naked dead man that an architect friend of his mother's finds in his London bathtub one night wearing only a pair of pince-nez glasses.  Meanwhile a rich London financier has turned up missing.  Peter is not the first to make the connection, but no one but he can possibly figure out that what connection there is to be made wasn't quite the one the police came up with.<br />\\"Whose Body?\\" is short, clever and enjoyable.  Sayers is an excellent and sympathetic writer who respects both her characters and the reader.  Her very much alive English settings, both the cold wet bogs and the warm dry fireplaces make Wimsey's world feel like a place I could happily call home.  And if you like this one they keep getting better as the series progresses.  Cheers!	2002-12-08

I can't say was disappointed, especially having gone back to the beginning of the series and read the first three I think it fun to know in advance the kind of mature and together character Lord Peter will become.  Sayers chooses to tell this story from the perspective of Harriet Vane, a mystery writer by profession who gets to say what her creator can't say straight out about the writing life and the reading public.<br />Sayers is a writer who knows how to create atmosphere, in this case the inner and outer life of Harriet as she experiences a reunion weekend at Oxford with its inevitable but welcome punting along the Thames, and pondering the value of the life of the mind.  Sayers also know how to make her mysteries crisp and entertaining, including here much running around with flashlights in the dark, chasing after vandals in the dark and the author of a series of poison pen letters that shake up the old maids of Shrewsbury College.<br />Vane has been saved from a murder charge by Wimsey in an earlier book, and she has not yet forgiven him for it, especially since he can't stop proposing marriage to her since.  Will he finally soften her up?  It's fun to watch him try, even as he helps her solve the series of particularly sinister crimes against the campus community.  \\"Gaudy Night\\" will not disappoint.	2002-12-08

I enjoyed reading it almost a decade ago as I ran from/toward my post-college life in a city and climate I had never lived in before.  The fact that the three principal characters were doing essentially the same thing I was struck a few chords of identification back then.  Andrew from Oregon, Dagmar from L.A. and Claire from the country club world make a fun Platonic threesome, \\"dropping out\\" of society by working \\"McJobs\\" in Palm Springs.  Though slightly younger than the narrator's younger brother, Tyler, I recognized much of the existential angst of growing up in a throwaway, mass pop culture.  And I am also old enough to remember the constant threat of nuclear holocaust (or nucular, as the undereducated pseudo-cowboy occupying 1600 Pennsylvania would have you believe--see p. 165 for definition of \\"Obscurism\\") which permeates the novel.<br />The world has improved in some ways since this book came out in 1991 when college grads were being welcomed by the worst economic environment for entry-level positions since the Great Depression, but don't tell that to the poor kids graduating next May.  Over the last decade many GenX'ers found out that yes, they could do better than their parents after all, but then narrator Andrew Palmer would be quick to question the definition of \\"better.\\"<br />Every generation thinks it's so tough and that the whiny young kids of today have it easier than they did.  The intelligent social observer will appreciate that challenges DIFFER from generation to generation--it's the lucky ones, not necessarily the weak ones, that don't have to fight wars to save the world from Hitler, stop the red menace in the jungle, or comb the deserts to keep the oilmen in power and SUV drivers in their high and mighty heated seats.  Generation X is a marketing term pretty effective in its day; it's also a demographic that will be running yourworld in the next ten to fifteen years.  \\"Generation X\\" is a curious and entertaining novel.  It's an insightful commentary about those who want to overcome the vapid and exploitative advertising culture that helped shape their characters whether they liked it or not.  It's worth the re-read, and if you haven't, it's worth a first read.	2002-12-08

Deputy Police Commissioner Scobie begins the book as a rare subject, an English colonial policeman in Africa not on the take.  He is cursed, however, with a wife who constantly, if not always overtly, reminds him that the life he has provided for them is beneath her.  Louise Scobie is one of those Catholics of the mid-twentieth century that believes things like missing mass on Sunday is a mortal sin, but unfortunately can't bring herself to \\"avoid superbia\\" as the nuns used to admonish schoolchildren in the fifties and sixties.  In other words, Louise is a snob.  When it's announced that her husband won't be promoted when the commissioner retires she simply can't deal with the shame of it.<br />Most of Scobie's capacity for love died several years earlier at a boarding school in England when their nine-year-old daughter was taken by a sudden illness--the difficulty of communication and the fact of World War II prevented him from even attending the funeral--and the third person narrator notes how he retreated into his job, but \\"[t]he less he needed Louise the more he felt responsible for her happiness.\\"  Louise does see Scobie's struggles, even gently accusing him of wishing she were dead.  He responds, as he always does, that her happiness is his priority, and promises to find a way to pay for her passage to South Africa, where she'll be able to be with friends and without the ignominy of not being the new commissioner's wife.  The only way to find the money is to borrow it from a well known but smooth Syrian crime boss who likes Scobie because he can trust him to be incorruptible.<br />Crossing the proprietary line of borrowing the money flows into crossing the mortal sin line as Scobie takes up with a much younger woman.  While he grows to love Helen, whom he meets in a hospital while she recovers from nearly dying in a shipwreck, he cannot love what he sees himself becoming.  Scobie's struggles with despair are moving and genuine, even as the reader perhaps wishes Scobie were just a little bit smarter than he is.  If he were of course, he wouldn't be Scobie, never able to attain his desired simple life where he can do his job and feel loved and loving, redeemed and free.<br />Greene's narrator is sympathetic and not particularly judgmental.  The style is clean and direct and the book is well organized.  I won't necessarily rush out and read another book by Greene, as it's time I avoided reminding myself of the Church-inflicted and self-inflicted moral tortures that Catholics put themselves through.  He's a fine writer, though, and \\"The Heart of the Matter\\" is a fine book.	2002-10-28

He is amusingly philosophical about it, actually, as he is about most of his dangerous undercover adventures.  By the end of the first chapter his assailant lies unconscious on the floor and Fincham's arm is intact.  Only his name isn't James Fincham, it's Thomas Lang, and though he's the good guy, he was the one breaking and entering.   A former member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Lang is now a private investigator who's had an offer he can refuse.  He'll have other offers, some from attractive females that he won't refuse and others from secret service agents and wealthy criminals that he has to think twice about (because to refuse could cause an international incident and harm to at least one of the attractive females).<br />Being a huge fan of Stephen Fry's books, and of much of the acting work he and Hugh Laurie have done together (Jeeves &amp; Wooster; Blackadder) I fully expected to enjoy this book, and I'm happy to say that I did so, thoroughly.  While &quot;The Gun Seller&quot; is a serious suspense thriller, complete with motorcycle chases and a healthy requisition of flying bullets, it's by no means a terribly dark one.   Laurie's sense of humor and facility with the English language are a joy on every page.  This one's a can't miss!	2002-10-12

Beginning a hair's breadth before Plato and bringing us all the way into the 1990s and issues of \\"hypertext,\\" this first giant Norton effort in the theory and criticism line seems to do all it sets out to do.  The excellent introduction nips so-called antitheorists in the bud, remarking, \\"there is no position free of theory, not even the one called `common sense.'\\"  It also welcomes the student intent on discovering the many and varied ways to examine literature for both enjoyment and edification, terms that we sometimes forget are not mutually exclusive. <br />Fully half the book is given over to theorists and critics of the twentieth century, which makes sense since far more than half of what we would call literary criticism was written during it.  My personal hope is that this new century gives birth to an understanding of theory that realizes, as do the Norton editors, that from the point of view of the student, each theory is essentially a lens through which to view a given work of art, literature, or the world in general.  As for the point of view of some professionals who may tend towards the territorial, let's be charitable and remember that they have to work for a living, too.  In any event, which lenses work the best on which student's eyes can truly be discovered only when a few different pairs have been tried on.<br />My professor friend notes that the selections from many key writers are longer than those found in the Hazard Adams' texts she used in the past.  This density makes even a two-semester survey difficult to plan, syllabus-wise, mostly because there are so many wonderful and important critics to cover and ideas to absorb.  My semi-professional advice would be to bring your love of literature and all your intellectual curiosity to \\"The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism,\\" but also remember to take deep breaths once in a while and never forget your sense of humor!	2002-08-30

I just couldn't find it humorous, though I can appreciate how bringing a different attitude to the book might make it the most hilarious dark comedy anyone has ever read.  It certainly is structured brilliantly, but you won't really be able to appreciate how brilliantly until you read it all the way through and get to the last page.  The novel is told episodically from the perspectives of each member of the Bundren family as they track through the Mississippi heat with the coffin of their dead mother (whose posthumous point of view is also provided).  It's a ridiculous and unnecessary journey that allows Faulkner to bring on display some of the very worst in human nature.<br />What troubled me about this book on the first reading, was that Faulkner doesn't seem to counterbalance the ugliness with beauty of any kind, but that's the reader's problem to deal with, I think.  By the end it is clear that Faulkner has done exactly what he has wanted to do and done it in such a way that \\"As I Lay Dying\\" has its own unique place in American and, surely, world literature.  This is a serious book, but if you don't take it too seriously, it might move you in ways I'm afraid it didn't move me.	2002-08-29

Henderson is the millionaire scion of a long line of prominent Americans, including a US Secretary of State, but he's also a ne'er do well alcoholic bully who raises pigs on his family's estate just to tell the neighbors (and the world at large) what he thinks of them.  He is no one that you'd want to meet, and he knows it.  He is also a seeker: all his life tormented by an inner voice crying \\"I want, I want\\" that his money, his women, his pigs, even surviving stepping on a land mine in WWII can't fulfill.  Because he is tormented, he torments others.  A trip into the least mapped areas of central Africa, he hopes, will offer him something worth living for, something to overcome his death wish.<br />If you are put off by Henderson's unlikableness early on, or if you tend to have no sympathy with the problems of wealthy characters (even if they are physically strong, don't shirk manual labor and never lose a bar fight) you could miss something special in this novel of a 50-year-old's adolescent yearning.  Henderson's journey is a bare-knuckled crawl from \\"becoming\\" to \\"being.\\"  \\"Being people have all the breaks,\\" notes Henderson, and becomers are \\"always in a tizzy.\\"  Most of literature concerns itself with the balance between these themes, and Bellow adds an original voice to the mix in Henderson, a becomer if there ever was one.  The native tribes have their good souls and bad souls, just like every society; Henderson is fortunate to meet more of the former.  While his bull-in-china-shop manner continues to cause him trouble, he at least desires to expand his capacity to learn new tricks at a relatively old age.  And isn't it learning that keeps us living? <br />\\"Henderson the Rain King\\" marks my first encounter with Saul Bellow, but certainly not my last.  He writes fearlessly and vividly, the reader feels the heat of Africa, smells the lions, tastes the slimy water with Henderson, and grows up a little with him, too, even as he grows up a lot.	2002-08-22

He very well may be, but no one will find out because the powers that be at the great London newspaper, \\"The Beast\\" (heated rival of \\"The Brute\\"), mistakenly send his distant cousin William Boot instead.  Poor William, who works for the paper already and was perfectly happy sending in his two essays a month on \\"Lush Places,\\" is pulled out of his comfortable country lifestyle and thrust toward a greatness so great he could only stumble upon it by accident.<br />\\"Scoop\\" is an unrelenting satire of the tabloid press of Waugh's day.  While it's arguably the most clever and well structured of the six of his novels I have read, imagine how much funnier it would be today if the general public didn't know so much about how journalists (even at the most respectable, unjaundiced papers) gather their stories.  William quickly learns how the Special Correspondents submit their \\"eyewitness accounts\\" of battle from cushy hotel rooms fifty miles from the fighting, how a telegram of ten words will get turned into three hundred and splashed on the front page.  And if the paper isn't happy with one writer, they can't send another because the journey from England to Africa takes three weeks!<br />As he does in \\"Decline and Fall\\" and \\"A Handful of Dust,\\" Waugh once again shows us an Englishman thrown into absurd circumstances beyond his control who won't or can't speak up to save himself the trouble.  Where \\"Scoop\\" improves, or at least differs, from the earlier works, is that William Boot does speak up for himself and it still doesn't help.  He's no fool, however, and at least ends up in a better place than several of Waugh's earlier protagonists.<br />It's probable that \\"Scoop\\" doesn't get read much by students anymore because of it's racist undertones (and epithets) and seemingly casual treatment of revolutions in post-colonial Africa.  Racist or not, what Waugh is really doing is making fun of the human race in all its varied colors and idiosyncrasies.  As always, he saves his most biting satire for his fellow English.<br />An extremely well constructed book, \\"Scoop\\" displays layer upon layer of absurd characters and situations that Waugh pulls expertly together in a most satisfying manner.  I thought he had really outdone himself with \\"A Handful of Dust,\\" but I find that \\"Scoop\\" is now my favorite.  Enjoy!	2002-08-10

Not only did \\"Fever Pitch\\" remind me how irrationally and how much I loved my own hometown team (the heartbreaking Boston Red Sox) but he turned me into a fan of English football and his own Arsenal Gunners to the point where I follow them daily on ESPN's soccernet, LISTEN (!?) to them on internet radio broadcasts and have even gone to two games in London over the past two years.  It's sick really, and I suppose it's not the kind of thing Hornby would have wanted when he wrote this quintessential memoir of growing up a soccer fan in England, but I've enjoyed it<br />\\"Fever Pitch\\" is an obsessive's  tale as much as it is a fan's story, and so should appeal to the same wide audience that enjoys his excellent novels (It was my love for \\"High Fidelity\\" that sent me straight to this book).  It is a memoir of surprising depth considering how it is organized only by the dates of soccer matches between 1968 and 1991, and it makes perfect sense that Hornby, or any true fan, should see the rest of his life (parents' divorce, his own education, romantic and career trouble) primarily as it relates to the team he spends so much time, money and psychic energy on.<br />The irony, for me, was finding out after I read \\"Fever Pitch\\" for the first time that Arsenal was one of the top teams of the last decade in England, so Hornby at least gets to feel the joy that we Red Sox fans are still waiting for.  Sure, we're ecstatic the Pats won the Super Bowl, but our lives will change forever when Boston brings home the World Series.  But after \\"Fever Pitch,\\" I'll remember to laugh like the rest of the world laughs when American sports leagues crown their title-holders \\"world\\" champions.	2002-08-09

The scope of Chabon's achievement, the sheer vitality of his main characters, and the author's complete control over a great number of plot twists and backdrops make this my favorite book of the year so far.<br />Teenage cousins Sammy Clay and Josef Kavalier meet in 1939 after Josef endures a harrowing escape from Prague, just before the Nazis begin rounding up the city's Jewish residents.  Sammy makes Josef as at home as possible in New York City while rejoicing at Josef's artistic talent which, combined with Sammy's chutzpah, will soon make them wealthy in the comic book business.  This opening may or may not seem like the beginning of one of the great American novels of our time, but \\"Kavalier & Clay\\" has nearly all anyone could ask for (though some may be disappointed that the book boasts only one well-rounded female character, Joe's beloved Rosa).  It has all of the struggles of man against an oppressive regime, man against the elements, man against himself--all this, and throw in Salvador Dali wearing a diving helmet to a dinner party!<br />While I tend to be in the camp of those who read for edification rather than escape, I naturally want both from good literature.  So does Chabon, as the narrator gives away the author's philosophy late in the book while explaining Josef's: \\"the shaping of a golem, [like the writing of a novel] to him, was a gesture of hope, offered against hope, in a time of desperation.\\"  And the more desperate the times, the more \\"noble and necessary\\" the service provided by novels, paintings and, of course, comic books.<br />Chabon's command of both language and metaphor is stunning.  He simply hits no sour notes.  The depth of his feeling is done justice by his style, pacing and structural brilliance.  \\"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay\\" is not a good book, it is a great book.	2002-08-09

It is a spacious and interesting coming-of-age tale, but really tells the story of the Nickleby family as a whole rather than just the honorable young gentleman. Once his father dies of a &quot;broken heart&quot; after going bankrupt in the stock market, Nicholas must find a way to provide for his beautiful and virtuous sister Kate, and his kind-hearted, self-absorbed martyr of a mother (think a less outrageous version of Elizabeth Bennett's mother in Jane Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;).  Their lives could all be made comfortable instantly if the dead Mr. Nickleby's brother Ralph weren't such a bitter, pitiless and hatefully cruel creature, but then Nicholas wouldn't have such a strong nemesis.<br />Nicholas takes jobs as an assistant schoolmaster, a traveling actor and a bookkeeper, all the while looking out for the honor of his family: biting his tongue when he has to and kicking some ungentlemanly derriere when he feels he absolutely must.  The speeches Dickens gives his characters when they have to stick up for themselves are particularly moving, even gripping, even if the circumstances are sometimes too melodramatic for the modern taste.  I didn't mind the melodrama myself, but rather enjoyed the way Dickens moves from sentence to long sentence as he was still developing his style which would reach greater heights in books like &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; one of only three other Dickens novels I have read.  As long and relaxingly enjoyable as it is, &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; becomes something of a living, breathing friend to the reader, guaranteeing it won't be the last of what Dickens called his &quot;children&quot; that I will come to know.	2002-08-03

He's also Head Boy at his English prep school, a position likely to make an enemy or two, whether today or in 1980 when the book opens.  After Ned commits a small, but not easily forgiven offense against a classmate, a simple prank to defame him coincides with a much greater secret service operation and he ends up locked in a psychiatric hospital for the better part of two decades.<br />Bereft of human contact for much of that time, except for that of his captors, Ned forgets who he is until he strikes up an unlikely friendship with a fellow patient named Babe.  A crusty old buggar is Babe, and he effectively pulls Ned back from the brink of madness (but not quite all the way--that's where the &quot;Revenge&quot; part comes in).  From Babe and the limited hospital library Ned receives a more intensive education than he was ever likely to get at Oxford--ask yourself how you'd spend all those years--becoming a master chess player and attaining fluency in over a half-dozen languages along the way while he prepares for life after his harrowing escape.<br />Fry's is an intellect which far surpasses that of most of his critics and, we must admit, many of his admirers as well.  This book is an attempt at something much darker and less outrageous than his previous work.  In so doing he mutes his narrative persona far more than in any of his previous work, which was at first slightly disappointing to me as a loyal fan. He succeeds, however in creating a genuine page-turner, even if it's not quite the thriller with a capital &quot;t&quot; one might have thought was coming.  Still, this is a worthwile book and evidence that Fry has lost nothing of his customary depth and cleverness.<br />If you are new to Fry I wholeheartedly recommend &quot;The Liar&quot; and &quot;The Hippopotamus&quot; which may have you laughing out loud for days if you like your English humor both erudite and locker-room.  There is still no living writer I'd rather invite to a dinner party more than Stephen Fry.  Cheers!	2002-08-02

That's not to say this book doesn't pack a punch for those already come of age.  Part of that punch's force, I presume, is in semi-fruitless imagining of how I would have reacted back then.<br />Highway is hilarious in his cynical, pustule-ridden loathsomeness, and many a brooding young American or British intellectual with find aspects of him to identify with.  He's blunt, he's crass, but he knows beauty when he sees it.  He's also a schemer who manages to have enough sex to warrant several trips to the VD clinic--it's 1973, after all--but not to let that stop him.  His pursuit of, attainment of and parting with the lovely Rachel of the title comprises an extraordinary pre-University summertime journey replete with references to famous English poets and sweaty bodily functions.  The character he most reminds me of in another book is Philip Roth's Alexander Portnoy.<br />Amis does such an amusing job of drawing together the lofty and the base in this, his first novel, that I look much forward to his more widely-known works.  \\"The Rachel Papers\\" will not appeal to everyone, but will achieve a special place in the libraries of angst-filled teens and their older selves.	2002-07-08

Sure, there may be other books that use the texts of e-mails to advance their stories, but in Matt Beaumont's extraordinary first novel the e-mails do it all.  Set in the London offices of a worldwide advertising agency called Miller Shanks--Armitage Shanks being, in real life, a popular British urinal manufacturer--which is hot on the trail of an account with Coca-Cola.  They might win it, too, if the self-aggrandizing executives and back-stabbing secretaries would allow the lascivious creative staff the freedom to do the job.  <br />Anyone who has worked in an office, or knows someone who has worked in an office will recognize Beaumont's archetypal characters even though he has blown them wonderfully out of proportion: the artistic director who does no work and takes all the credit; the lonely accounts staffer who runs auctions from his desk; the secretary who can't do simple tasks because she has a body waxing appointment; the tongue-pierced graphic designers who only come to work for the toys, the female co-workers' cleavage, and the beer money.  That's just the outer offices!<br />Beaumont gets a remarkable number of different voices pitch-perfect.  The only time I was able to put this book down was when it forced me into uncontrollable fits of falling-off-the-couch laughter.  I've laughed out loud to other British authors Stephen Fry, Nick Hornby and Martin Amis, but to none of them so often or so long as to \\"e\\". If you like sarcasm, if you like dramatic irony, if you love it when horrible people get exactly what's coming to them, you will not be able to put \\"e\\" down either.<br />And once you've enjoyed \\"e\\", check out Amazon.co.uk to pick up Beaumont's short, but worthy follow-up not published in the US: \\"The e Before Christmas\\".

I look forward to see what he can do when he gives himself more space.  Though under two hundred pages, \\"Amsterdam\\" pretty well says all it needs to say.<br />Clive Linley and Vernon Halliday are long-time friends at the top of their respective professions, and are also former lovers of a woman, Molly, who clearly attracts men marked for greatness in one way or another.  Her death opens the novel, and precipitates her widower's decision to destroy the reputation of her most famous of infidelities, the man next in line for the British prime minister's office.  The complicity of Vernon in this scheme (he's a newspaper editor) stretches his friendship with Clive, and accelerates the undoing of each.<br />McEwan's prose is clean and direct.  It's possible that McEwan was thinking of his own writing when he makes the composer Clive think about a melody: \\"In it's simplicity lay all the authority of a lifetime's work\\"  Regardless, \\"Amsterdam\\" asks more questions than it answers, as any superior work of art should, whatever the artist's choice of media.  It also cuts directly to the heart of what motivates men at crucial moments in their lives, the type of moments that can cost them everything they hold dear.  It rewards the reader with much more than some might expect due to its shorter length.  At worst you can write it off as an enjoyable intellectual quickie!	2002-07-08

English country gentleman Tony Last is held up as one of the last of his breed: land wealthy but cash poor, he spends too much time restoring his gothic mansion while his wife sits in third class when she takes the train to London.  We might expect such a woman to grow bored and have an affair, and Brenda Last does not disappoint, except in her choice of the unexceptional youth John Beaver as a lover.  Nor does she disappoint in trying to blame Tony or others when it comes time for a settlement: &quot;Tony, don't be so bullying. The lawyers are doing everything.&quot;<br />While Waugh takes pleasure in satirizing Tony's breed, he is more sympathetic to the individual, and the reader begins to root for him once he finally stands up for himself, and cannot help but pity him as he makes his one final journey to refresh himself for life without his family.  &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot; is the fifth Waugh novel I have read, and by far the most satisfying so far.

Long an admirer of his \\"Book of Laughter and Forgetting,\\" I only recently sat back and read this marvelous novel of love and obsession, lust and oppression. \\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\\" is primarily the tale of a Prague physician, Tomas, who escapes with his wife Tereza to Zurich after the Russian tanks roll over their country in 1968. When his infidelities drive her to leave him and return to Prague he follows her, knowing there will be no other chance to escape Communism. An editorial Tomas has published in an anti-Communist newspaper loses him his license to practice medicine and he soon becomes a window washer.  Much to his surprise he's happier for a while in a job he doesn't have to think about (\\"it's a terrific relief to realize you're free, free of all missions\\"). Meanwhile, Tereza continues to play the martyr as his philandering increases. The reader is left to wonder whether it is weakness or strength that keeps them together, and how much the lack of political freedom affects the way men and women love each other. Kundera's narrator explores these and other vital questions of being, sometimes with gentle prodding, and others with sudden incisiveness.<br />Writtten in 1984, five years before the Velvet Revolution would draw back the Iron Curtain from Kundera's Czech homeland, \\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\\" is both a product of its era and a timeless work of art. It makes us wonder whether life is difficult because it is heavy, or because the fleetingness of it makes us too light to really make a mark. This novel of heavy concepts is written with such a light touch that the mark it makes cannot be denied. The narrator brings up the German phrase \\"Einmal ist keinmal\\": whatever happens once may as well not have happened at all-unlike many other books we read and forget as soon as we finish the last page, this one sticks, even as it cries out to be re-read.	2002-06-08

He may be the best literary example of the tortures a sane person goes through in a world of crazy and dishonest men.  A WWII bombardier who's tired of people trying to kill him, Yossarian can't get over seeing a kid in his plane die in his arms, in fact he can't get over death at all, or the people who seem perfectly relaxed about flying into its jaws on a regular basis.  No one has the right to say he hasn't done his duty, but they say it anyway, and every time he flies the required number of missions to be sent home, Yossarian's insecure, self-aggrandizing colonel raises the number of missions.  As a result, most of Yossarian's friends end up killed in action and somehow Yossarian ends up not insane despite the best efforts of all his superior officers and doctors to convince him otherwise.<br />You almost have to take an amphetamine to SLOW the effect of Heller's rapid-fire prose.  Yossarian is the only roundly developed character in the book; everyone else is a just developed enough so as not to seem a caricature, but most are distorted extremes (e.g. Milo Minderbender who runs such a highly profitable international black market that he gets praised for bombing his own troops, or the never available \\"Major Major Major Major.\\")  Heller uses these distortions for their humorous, satirical effect, and they work, but never do they obscure the true horror of the experience of the men fighting the war.<br />How I wish I had read CATCH-22 in high school.  So many of the daring, anti-establishment, questioning of \\"excessive authority or obsolete traditions\\" would have stirred me up and made me laugh so much more than they do now, at thirty.  And the sexy parts would have really got me going more as a teenager.  CATCH-22 remains and important anti-war text, and an important lesson for allto beware of those who push empty-headed patriotism and religio-pietistic mind control.  Heller pleads us to think as he shows us the evil that men do when justice is a commodity.  Intelligent teenagers of all ages should read this book.	2002-05-20

Through the pen of the almost ninety-year-old \\"Smitty,\\" we read the sad and disturbing tale of how the Ruppert Mundys of the mythical and defunct Patriot League were forced to spend all of 1943 playing away games after their owners sold their home stadium to the War Department as an embarkation point for our brave soldiers.  Is Smitty as insane as many others obviously find him?  Did the Mundys really have a one-legged catcher, a one-armed center fielder, a 14-year-old second baseman and a dwarf as a relief pitcher?  Just who really is the Babylonian former ace pitcher Gil Gamesh?  Was there really a Communist plot to destroy America by first destroying baseball?<br />It is curiosity and determination to finish this too-long-by-a-third book that may keep you reading through to the end, I'm afraid I had to force myself through it.  We certainly aren't supposed to like any of the characters, so that means the story better hold us.  And while it's a great story with a good number of laughs, there are too many long-winded passages that just aren't as funny once you get the rhythm down-the satire is dulled by them, in fact.  I submit that Roth knew this and simply didn't care: by 1973 when this book was published he had been a bestseller for over twenty years.  It wouldn't surprise me at all if he had a Dickensian paid-by-the-word contract for this book.  Additionally, there are the letters to Smitty in the Epilogue from publishers rejecting his manuscript of the Patriot League story, one of which says, \\"by and large the book seemed . . . to strain for its effects and to simplify for the sake of facile satiric comment the complex realities of American politicaland cultural life.\\"  Now while the complex realities of American political and cultural life can never be underestimated, Roth clearly knew the monster he created.  And what fun for him to slap the Great American Novel title on it all!  <br />I really enjoyed the first couple of hundred pages of this book, and I recommend it to those who are also students of baseball history (Roth weaves many real names and situations and speeches of old into his text) and aficionados of Roth.  This is only my third Roth book, his earlier works PORTNOY'S COMPLAINT is one of my favorites of all time and GOODBYE, COLUMBUS is an entertaining first novel.  I'm sorry I couldn't stay as excited about this one as it lumbered on, even if that was the point.  Terrific concept, though.	2001-08-06

Twentysomething Adam Fenwick-Symes cant catch a break: after months spent in Paris writing his memoirs he has his manuscript of them confiscated and burned by his own English customs (If we cant stop literature in this country, we can at least stop its being brought in from outside, says the Comstockian official).  As a result Adam spends much of the rest of the book fumbling to find ways to earn the income that would support his beloved Nina Blount should she stop her waffling and decide to marry him.<br />Waughs characters are picture postcards, some glittering, some torn, but all destined for the wastepaper basket sooner or later.  Caring about the characters is not the issue here, laughing at them and fearing that their types might ever really have existed is most of the fun.  Everyone seems to have popped off the pages of a tabloid, and in certain cases, they have, since one of Adams writing jobs becomes reporting the society news.  People with names like Fanny Throbbing and Miles Malpractice drink, are callous to each other, have sex without meaning and die without being mourned.  Such fun!  No wonder the spiritually troubled Waugh ends the book with a war that wouldnt arrive for another nine years after VILE BODIES was published.<br />This book is an improvement over Waughs first effort, DECLINE AND FALL, though its not as funny as his satire on the Californian funeral industry in THE LOVED ONE.  It is, however, just enough to make me read more of his works.  Im convinced that much of what people found so acidly funny about this book in 1930 was a function of how shocking Waughs subtle and overt references were to ballroom and bedroom behavior at the time.  The moral undercurrent of meaninglessness simmers beneath the surface all thewhile as characters separate from each other and come back together by humorous coincidences and contrived absurdity.  It comes out here and there, as when Mr. Outrage says to Fr. Rothschild that the BYPs of the post-WWI generation had a whole civilization to be made and remadeand all they seem to do is play the fool.  The priest suggests that the war may have been to blame: I dont think people ever WANT to lose their faith.<br />VILE BODIES wont restore anyones faith, but it will entertain them for a while, and perhaps make them puzzle over its meaning.  And that cant be bad, can it?	2001-08-04

No, the issues are far from comfortable.  The racism is stark, but the heroism is stolid.  Through Scouts eyes we see a world of many colors and textures, but one must read the book to appreciate even a few of them.<br />More than four decades since it was first published, Harper Lees book is more than just a tale of courage in the face of racial bigotry in the mid-twentieth century rural South, it is more than a tale of a girls love for her father, it is more than a novel. Without hyperbole, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is truly an American treasure.  If you have never taken or been given the opportunity to read this book even if you dont read that many novels you owe it to yourself to transcend all the politics and attain the better understanding of humanity that Harper Lee can help you discover.  After all, she has helped so many millions of schoolchildren do just that in the past two or three generations.  Neither does she do it with the preachy tone I found myself falling into for this review!  Whatever your age or color, enjoy!	2001-08-04

As the \\"hero\\" of Evelyn Waugh's first novel he is barely worth a cent and light as pillow stuffing.  This flimsiness of character may cause concern unto lack of concern in the reader who wishes to strongly identify with the protagonist, but halfway through the book, Waugh's narrator assures us that Pennyfeather's hollowness is intentional:<br />\\"In fact, the whole of this book is really an account of the mysterious disappearance of Paul Pennyfeather, so that readers must not complain if the shadow which took his name does not amply fill the important part of hero for which he was originally cast.\\"<br />Pennyfeather is someone who is acted upon more than he acts--perhaps it is better to say he is more sinned against than sinning--his story begins when he is attacked in an Oxford quad by a group of his snobbish bully classmates.  They strip him naked from the waist down and before he knows it the university has expelled him for indecent behavior.  He then loses his allowance and ends up teaching in a disreputable prep school in Wales where adventures continue to be inflicted upon him.<br />Waugh never allows Pennyfeather to defend himself, his satirical point being that an English gentleman wouldn't stoop to blame those who had wronged him, even if it means he goes to jail.  After all, his irrepressible fellow teacher Grimes tells Paul, no matter how bad things get, there is \\"a blessed equity in the English social system that insures the public school man [public schools in England are actually private] against starvation.\\"  It's that social system that the young Waugh, twenty-five when this book was published, enjoys puffing up just to tear it down.  Waugh maintains a light narrative touch though his subject matter is often serious and occasionally outrageous.  He structures the book well and has a sharp appreciation for the absurdities of the English upper classes in the 1920s that is not inapplicable to many other time periods and cultures.<br />DECLINE AND FALL did not make me laugh as much as I thought it might.  There are funnier English campus comedies out there, notably Kingsley Amis's LUCKY JIM and the first part of Waugh's own BRIDESHEAD REVISITED.  Waugh was one of the twentieth century's great stylists, however, and I look forward to reading his second book, VILE BODIES.	2001-07-15

I haven't figured out why this book isn't a bigger hit, is it the Irish thing?  It shouldn't be, there's a useful and amusing glossary in the back of Irish terms that are too &quot;Bourgeois To Explain&quot; in the text.<br />Tom Iremonger is one of the most in-your-face characters you're ever likely to meet, but only in the narrating of his own story--if you met him in a pub he'd probably be too cool to talk to you.  He's a male model after all, and his poster is up all over Ireland, with the caption &quot;Ireland's Greatest Resource.&quot;  Why he decides to come home for Christmas after his six month &quot;anti-odyssey&quot; flying all over the world and spending his grandfather's inheritance is something he can't figure out, but once he's home he realizes that it must be to go to Mainie Doyle's party.  Mainie is Tom's on-again, off-again girlfriend, the female version of the Ireland's Greatest Resource poster.  Tom's substance-enhanced adventures trying to get an invitation while not seeming to want one are alternately frustrating and hilarious.  Iremonger is one of the most self-absorbed characters I've ever come across, and that's the point.  He does terrible, self-destructive things but they seem all to be a pose, his true heart is aching underneath all the drug-induced bravado and yearning for redemption.<br />Robert Cremins is an excellent, sensitive, clever and funny young writer and I look forward to his follow-up to this entertaining and moving coming-of-age tale.  He is irreverent in the most wholesome sense of the word.  If you like Nick Hornby or Dave Eggers, you will find Cremins well worth the $11.  If you are a twentysomething American of Irish descent and Catholic upbringing this book is a must read--even if you still go to mass.  Slainte!	2001-03-15

High praise is due Don George and Salon.com for gathering such a stirring and tantalizing collection of writings together: in forty short pieces not one dull or sappy note is struck.<br />For romance, the standouts of this collection are Maxine Rose Schur's &quot;Passionate and Penniless in Paris,&quot; about the time she spent with her husband living in a van by the Quai de la Tournelle; Simon Winchester's &quot;Romance in Romania&quot; where the Rolls Royce he happens to be driving brings both him and a young Romanian girl into a beautiful moment that takes its romance from its very fleetingness; Iyer's own short, musical &quot;Bewitched in Bali&quot;; &quot;Fade Into Blue,&quot; written in the third person by Amanda Jones; and most memorable of all, Laura Fraser's &quot;Italian Affair,&quot; one of the most personal pieces in the book, but written completely in the second person (let's just say it begins with &quot;Let's say your husband leaves you&quot; and ends with her discovery of &quot;la bella vita&quot;).<br />Notable for their adventurous qualities are Bill Belleville's &quot;Looking for Mr. Watson&quot; in the heart of the Florida Everglades; Don Meredith's relaxed brush with death in &quot;Sleeping With Elephants&quot;; Jeffrey Tayler's not-so-relaxed brush with death in &quot;Lost in the Sahara&quot;; editor Don George's surprising fear of climbing Half-Dome in Yosemite while watching his 8- and 10-year-old children scamper up likesquirrels--he not afraid for them, he's jealous of them; and Susan Hack's humorous &quot;Tampax Nightmares.&quot;<br />Of course romance and adventure are not mutually exclusive, and many of the stories here exhibit both. The writers of SALON.COM'S WANDERLUST convey the sights, sounds, smells, tastes and feel of the places they go--both externally and inside their own heads. The reader is transported to all seven continents and several states of being (drunk on absinthe, crashing a motorcycle while on heroin, eating the ambrosial sauces of the Memphis World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest). It will be hard to read just a quarter of these stories and not want to make your plane reservations, stuff a new notebook into your backpack and just go.	2001-03-05

A different world indeed, even from the jazzy age of 1920s and 30s England that P. G. Wodehouse employs as his setting.  The code of the Woosters is to never let a friend down, and Bertie would do this far more often were it not for his tactful and clever gentleman's personal gentleman, Jeeves.  Bertie is a marvelous type of fellow: over-educated but under-intelligent; useless to society but wealthy beyond any need for scruple; completely numbed by the simple pleasures of an aristocratic life, but always there for his friends and family in a pinch.  Amusingly enough, very few of the people that Bertie is enlisted in aiding actually deserve anyone's help.  He is variously bullied and cajoled--but usually blackmailed--into putting himself in the most precarious positions.  He must steal a cow-shaped piece of silver or his Aunt Dahlia will never let him eat a meal served by her godly French chef; he must steal a policeman's helmet to indirectly prevent himself from betrothal to a starry-eyed ditz of a woman.  Being a Wooster, of course, he would go through with such a wedding rather than be impolite.<br />What makes Bertie's bumbling and stumbling antics the more amusing is that he fancies himself a man of wit and decisiveness.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Jeeves is the man for that, as well as the man to keep Bertie from his predilection for screaming fashion faux pas.<br />Wodehouse employs a wonderfully dry wit and a delivery that ranges between the anecdotal and the rat-a-tat.  One finds oneself smiling through every page, and occasionally being forced to place the book on the side table so as not to harm in during a fit of laughing out loud.  Wodehouse's influence on writers such as Evelyn Waugh, Kingsley Amis and Stephen Fry has enriched British literature of the last century, but he himself was a true original, as are Jeeves and Wooster.	2001-02-18

When the paperback version of this staggering book comes out this week it will have 15,000 more words in it than the one I recently finished--the one that made such a big and buzzy splash last year.  Whether this expansion is good or bad (and it will most likely be good), and whether it is Dave Eggers' fervent wish or a ploy by the publishers (and it is most likely both) is yet to be seen.  That said, I don't think AHWOSG needs another 15,000 words to be any more effective than it already is as a moving and hilarious story of a young man who has overcome some terrifying obstacles.<br />On the opening flyleaf are printed the words \\"THIS WAS UNCALLED FOR.\\"  If you believe that there are some things that art can't touch, then you'll agree.  George Bernard Shaw wrote something very like, \\"life doesn't stop being funny just because somebody dies, nor does it stop being serious just because somebody laughs.\\"  Eggers has faced death, and to be sure he has suffered, but he embraces life and understands that all we have is what we make out of it.  He bleeds his soul onto these pages and produces beauty out of heartache, blasts humor from stupidity, and conquers fear with love.  His greatest love being that of his eight-year-old brother.  The brother he is charged with raising from age 23 after both their parents die of cancer only 32 days apart.<br />Art aside, this novelized memoir has some interesting things to say about what constitutes what is fair to use from other people's lives when telling one's own story.  I particularly recommend the dialogue that debates the resolution: \\"We are all feeding from each other, all the time, every day.\\"  AHWOSG is written with a serpentine self-consciousness that eats itself and then, often as not, says \\"Yum!\\"  It is brilliant, and almost as cathartic for the reader as it is for the author--a point (his own catharsis) that he is clear about emphasizing.  Those who accuse Eggers of cheap exhibitionism, however, are cranks: this is solidgold exhibitionism.<br />Two or three years my senior, Dave Eggers is a shining example of the ironic GenX type that has paid close attention to the billions of images that has bombarded it, has paid close attention to relationships with other people, and knows everything is both real and just a show of itself.  He represents and illustrates the mass of contradictions, the embracing of opposites that has characterized the modern age since Oscar Wilde first said...well...pretty much anything Oscar Wilde ever said.

One of the funny things about ancient Greek literature, as in our lives today and human life in general, is that sometimes situations can be so harshly unforgiving, and at other times loopholes abound.  THE ORESTEIA of Aeschylus gives us some of our first loopholes, with the eventual acquital of Orestes for the matricide which avenged his father's murder.<br />If ever the sins of a father were visited upon his sons, it happened first with the house of Atreus.  Poor Agamemnon, greatest of the Greek kings though he is, is doomed from the start--what with his father Atreus having chopped up his cousins and served them to his uncle Thyestes in a stew years before.  This brings down the curse that results in Agamemnon's sacrifice of his daughter Iphigeneia's life so that the winds will blow the Greek ships on to Troy where a whole war will be fought to rescue his brother Menelaus' queen Helen.  No surprise that Agamemnon's wife, Clytaemnestra doesn't find the death of her daughter a good trade for the rescue of his sister-in-law.  While Agamemnon is off for ten years leading the Greeks to victory (or almost keeping them from it, as those who have read THE ILIAD know well), Clytaemnestra takes Aegisthus for her lover--he just happens to be the one son of Thyestes that escaped the infamous stew.  Together they plot the king's destruction, and in the first play of the trilogy, the AGAMEMNON, they achieve it.<br />The disturbing thing about ancient Greek literature, as in life, is that the subjects are never wholly innocent or wholly guilty; Fate may have foreordained Agamemnon's destruction, but he certainly helps it along by being persuaded to walk on crimson tapestries fit only for gods.  This little bit of hubris is also well within the bounds of his character set by Homer a couple of hundred years or more before Aeschylus' time.  What of Clytaemnestra's claim against him for killing their daughter?  And the claim of Aegisthus for what Agamemnon's father did to his?  THEORESTEIA asks far more questions than it pretends to answer.<br />In THE LIBATION BEARERS, Atreus' grandson Orestes returns to avenge his father's death by the horrible crime of killing his mother.  The EUMENIDES is a courtroom drama brought about by the fact that the howling female Furies demand Orestes' blood for his mother's.  If they were to succeed then revenge would perpetuate revenge ad infinitum, and here Apollo and Athena step in to help provide a more civilized solution.<br />Aeschylus leaves us much to ponder about revenge, forgiveness, and family relationships.  Very powerful stuff!  The AGAMEMNON is one of the world's greatest and darkest tragedies, THE LIBATION BEARERS one of the most moving and horrifying revenge plays, but as the one that ties things all up into a nice bundle, THE EUMENIDES is a shade less gripping than the other two.  A good time to read THE ORESTEIA would be as an interlude between THE ILIAD and THE ODYSSEY, as its events take place pretty much between the two Homeric epics.  Though I prefer Sophocles and Euripides as playwrights, they owe a great debt to their precursor Aeschylus, rightly deemed \\"the Father of Tragedy.\\"	2000-11-19

Rowling definitely belongs in the pantheon of children's book writers that can create a complete world for developing imaginations to explore and simultaneously pique an adult's interest.  As a CHRONICLES OF NARNIA adorer, I have no hesitation saying her name in the same breath as C. S. Lewis.  The other night I tried to read Madeline L'Engle's classic, A WRINKLE IN TIME, for further comparison (it had been over 20 years since I read it for the first time); while enjoyable, it just didn't whisk me away like HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE.<br />Harry Potter is an orphaned child of magical parents raised in a hateful and merciless environment.  Admission to the Hogwarts School is both his birthright and saving grace.  His shy but brave friend Ron, overshadowed by famous brothers, and their dying-to-know-it-all classmate Hermione help Harry negotiate a magical boarding school with its bullies, dark passageways, and nitpicky teachers.  We've all read stories of witches and wizards before, but Rowling is that one author in a generation who breathes new life into our archetypes.<br />I held off reading the first Harry Potter book until my wife borrowed it from a friend of ours recently.  While I'm not racing out to buy the other three, I certainly will pick them up in paperback as they become available.<br />This is one that lives up to the hype admirably folks--anything that's popular inevitably will have its detractors, but people should remember this is a children's book, and children are in many ways smarter than adults.  It is also a work of art, and for the number of children Rowling has gotten excited about reading she probably deserves a Nobel Prize.  Now if those kids would only grow up to read Cervantes and Shakespeare, something far more magical than Harry Potter's wand will have done fine work.  Cheers, Harry!	2000-11-08

I did not expect something written thousands of years ago to have such colorful language and vivid images.  Nor did I expect it to surpass anything I had read before as the greatest story ever told.  Very few works have even matched it in my last 15 years of reading.<br />THE ODYSSEY is the prototypical journey tale of world literature.  After ten years fighting and helping the Greeks win the Trojan War, Odysseus, King of Ithaka, offends the sea god Poseidon and is doomed to another ten years of wandering before being able to return to his wife, son, and homeland.  He meets all manner of deadly obstacles and pleasant diversions along the way, but always in his mind is the desire for home. Virtually everything is in THE ODYSSEY: a son's coming-of-age without his father, a hero's escape from giant whirlpools, sexy sorceresses and the angry wine-dark sea, the most faithful wife in the history of literature, and that's just for starters.<br />Fitzgerald imposes no stylistic or rhythmic roadblocks, on the contrary, his poetry is smooth and his gift for bring us all the color and music of Homer is rich and deft.  In my book, only Shakespeare and Tolstoy are in the same class as Homer, but the ancient one should be experienced first.  Read THE ODYSSEY before or after THE ILIAD, but read it and enjoy.	2000-10-26

Each man's pride is too much: Agamemnon refuses to give back the girl and Achilles refuses to continue fighting.  Since Achilles is the Greeks' greatest warrior, the fortunes of the Trojans markedly improve while he famously sulks in his tent.  But the Greeks fight on, and such heroes as Diomedes, Aias (Ajax) and Odysseus continue the fight to sack Troy as return the queen Helen to her husband Menelaos, King of Argos.  Over the lengthy yet colorful descriptions of battle, they are driven back to their ships by the Trojans, led by their prince and greatest warrior, Hektor (brother of Paris, who has stolen Helen with the help of Aphrodite).<br />The ILIAD is really the story of Achilles, and is his tragedy.  Once the danger of defeat seems imminent, Agamemnon offers to give the girl back and make amends (as long as Achilles realizes who's still boss) but Achilles remains caught up in his prideful wrath.  He eventually returns to the fight and drives the Trojans back inside their own walls, but the price he pays is dear.<br />The ILIAD is also notable for its depiction of the gods.  Far from being above it all, Athena, Ares and their immortal siblings get right down on the beach and take sides in the war.  You might think that a battlefield is no place for the goddess of love, but don't worry, Aphrodite soon learns the same.  The Greeks will suffer, but the greater powers of Mt. Olympos are behind them, effectively making their victory inevitable.<br />Since Lattimore was trying to get as close to the Greek as he could, his English translation is less poetic than those of Robert Fitzgerald or, I imagine, Robert Fagles (who is next on my list).  But it does have its own stately rhythm that should hardly be inaccessible to the modern college student or adult.  For high schoolers, though, I would recommend reading one of the other translators first, as the first time one reads Homer, it should be for the story.

Twenty years of setting it aside, I spent the end of this past summer slowly and patiently enjoying every minute of Tolkien's grand and masterful tale of Middle-earth.<br />The hobbit Frodo has a simple task fraught with the most terrible of dangers--journey to the Crack of Doom to destroy the One Ring so that the evil lord Sauron cannot use it to subjugate the land and all its inhabitants.  The trouble is that the Crack of Doom is in Sauron's own country, and his Eye sees almost everything.  Advised by the wizard Gandalf and accompanied by three fellow hobbits, two men, a dwarf and an elf, Frodo's journey is the main thrust of the tale.  Meanwhile, preparations for the decisive war are being made on both sides of the mountains that border Mordor, the land of Sauron.<br />Tolkien's style is straightforward and measured--the narrator never gets excited.  Tolkien was a Classics professor so it should be no surprise that Frodo's journey is told with several Homeric devices, notably the repeated descriptions of the weather (reminded me of &quot;dawn's rosy fingers&quot; reappearing every day in THE ODYSSEY) and the state of the characters' stomachs.  Also like Homer, Tolkien allows his characters to tell their own stories around the fire.  To read THE LORD OF THE RINGS well perhaps also takes the skills of a good listener.<br />The length of THE LORD OF THE RINGS forces well-intended readers afflicted with the modern short attention span into a calmer, more relaxed perspective.  While Frodo and his dear friend Sam may run till they drop, while Gandalf's horse Shadowfax may outpace all other animals that run, Tolkien never rushes. This deliberate pacing is a prime reason why his epic is so rich and rewarding.<br />THE LORD OF RINGS gives us much to think about on the theme of what any one of us is really capable of.  It deals with honor, endurance, treachery and sacrifice like few other stories of the twentieth century.  Sit back, relax, and be transported to Middle-earth.ith honor, endurance, treachery and sacrifice like few other stories of the twentieth century.

Fear not, thinking animals of the farm!  This book is only a number one bestseller because of it's corporate connections--it proudly lists 72 of them (AAA through Xerox) before the title page.  Reminds me of the George W. Bush campaign's $100,000 Pioneer donors being passed off as a groundswell of popular support--admit it, ninety percent of you read this book because your company made it required reading.<br />I'm reassured that the head of my 25-person company gave it to his staff with some idea that he would be insulting their intelligence, but that the book would spark positive discussion anyway (last year's title was Ken Blanchard's RAVING FANS).  I just lament the $250 or more he must have spent on it.<br />What about the message of this cute little hardbacked pamphlet?  Change happens, deal with it or starve, you silly mouse you.

US	51901277	R1LQANH2QEVZEF	0300001223	345256584	The Victorian Frame of Mind, 1830-1870 (Yale Paperbound, Y-99)	Books	5	30	30	N	N	A Monument of Intellectual History	First published in 1957 with the intent to show some of the roots of the &quot;modern mind&quot; (which was then still recovering from McCarthyism),  Walter Houghton's book more than accomplishes its stated goals.  THE  VICTORIAN FRAME OF MIND is divided in to three parts in which Houghton  examines Victorian emotional, intellectual and moral attitudes. He bases  these discussions on the premise that 1830-1870 was an &quot;age of  transition,&quot; and that the Victorian English were the first to think of  their own time as &quot;an era of change FROM the past TO the  future.\\"<br />The Victorians found the pace of their life compared to that of  their grandfathers to be inordinately fast, they both lamented and welcomed  the breakdown of old regimes and the coming into its own of the Industrial  Revolution.  Darwin's theory of evolution made thousands of them quake in  their boots--even though so many of them were raised on a wrathful God more  than a loving God, the prospect of no God at all sent many running for the  metaphorical hills.  Throughout the book, Houghton extensively quotes the  Victorians themselves (e.g. Ruskin, Arnold, Carlyle, Charles Kingsley) and  it is shocking and uncanny how many times what was written a good 150 years  ago resembles what you might find in the press and literature of today.   This from 1851: &quot;everybody has his own little ISM . . . by which the  country can be saved.&quot;  How about this line from Carlyle's PAST AND  PRESENT: \\"we have profoundly forgotten everywhere that Cash-payment is not  the sole relation of human beings.\\"<br />A key to understanding how Victorians  thought about themselves and their world, Houghton points out, lies in  accepting the many contradictions and tensions of the age, most importantly  their overwhelming optimism balanced against their high level of anxiety.   Of the book's fourteen chapters, particularly interesting and provocative  are those on \\"The Critical Spirit--and The Will to Believe,\\" \\"The  Commercial Spirit,\\" \\"Dogmatism,\\" and \\"Hypocrisy.\\"<br />Houghton admits from  the start that he's out for the \\"general sense\\" of how people thought, and  he narrows his purview even further to the literate classes.  He therefore  makes many sweeping statements that could still meet with criticism--even  with the quotations he provides from the writers of the time.  THE  VICTORIAN FRAME OF MIND is still a useful background text for scholars,  though it might put off those with ISMs on their shoulders.  Moreover, it  is a rich and engaging book for the student or amateur of the Victorian  era, which, while different in several important ways from our own American  society, is all too eerily similar when you come right down to it.  Highly  recommended!	2000-08-17

The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies.\\"  Thus says  FAHRENHEIT 451's Professor Faber in explaining to Guy Montag the importance  of the \\"telling detail\\" of books.  Montag is ready to hear these words, his  job as a book burner in this twisted society of Ray Bradbury's invention no  longer makes sense to him.<br />Books are illegal in the world of FAHRENHEIT  451.  So is driving under 55 m.p.h.  Faster is always considered better.   Montag's society doesn't want anyone to stop and reflect, because it  realizes that if people stop and think about things, they'll get restless.   As Montag's fire captain tells him, \\"You ask why to a lot of things and you  wind up very unhappy indeed.\\"  An important difference between this  futuristic society created in 1953 and George Orwell's world of 1984 is  that Orwell's government was top-down while all the minorities (of every  race, color and creed) in Bradbury's dystopia got together to burn  everything that offended them.  In this case, lack of tolerance for  differing voices led to no voices at all--democracy has eaten itself by  misunderstanding itself.  Problems aren't faced; they are burned.  This is  the world Guy Montag rebels against; how deeply it reflects our own world  is something to think about along the way.<br />Ray Bradbury is a good writer,  one who encourages people to ask the question &quot;why&quot;.  He wants  everyone to have a voice and to be able to express himself or herself, but  not in such a way that they drown out other voices--the best ideas, he  seems to believe, will naturally come to the fore.  A short book of under  180 pages, FAHRENHEIT 451 is often assigned to middle school students.  For  those--like myself--who missed it in school, it still stands as an  important work for all lovers of reading, freedom, and ideas for their own  sake.	2000-08-08

It remains one of the key books of my  intellectual development.  1984 was the first book to get me to think about  the importance of the freedom of the individual, the dangers of mob  psychology and the evils of totalitarianism.<br />Winston Smith is a member of  the Party, as is everyone else who isn't a &quot;prole,&quot; and like  everyone else, he lives &quot;from birth to death under the eye of the  Thought Police.&quot;  Orwell builds up a gray and chilling world where  &quot;no emotion was pure, because everything was mixed up with fear and  hatred.&quot;<br />This is what Orwell imagined in 1949 would be the logical  extension of communism.  And look where we are, fully sixteen years after  the year 1984, with the video camera technology that can do effectively the  same thing as the Party's telescreens.  Imagine life with a TV that could  watch you while you watched it--a TV that could bellow at you to do your  calisthenics in the morning or face arrest!  That's what Big Brother is all  about, the absolute lack of privacy to enforce the absolute conformity of  action and thought--something to contemplate before tuning in one of those  cheesy &quot;real-life&quot; TV-ratings-grabbers.  In Orwell's 1984, there  was nothing to laugh about.<br />Orwell's writing style is intentionally as  stark as the world he creates.  The narrator does a lot of telling as well  as showing, but this does not slow the pace.  I heartily recommend 1984 for  anyone over eleven who appreciates his or her freedom and individuality.  You may appreciate it far more once you have finished this book.	2000-08-04

Steinbeck's deeply touching tale of displaced families and a nation rent by Depression will never cease to be relevant.<br />The Joads and  thousands of others are driven out of Oklahoma by drought and the  Depression.  It is bad enough they lose their farms to homes and have to  move.  It is worse that the big business fruit growers in California print  misleading flyers claiming to have far more well-paying jobs available than  they ever intended to have.  It is miserable when they get to California  (where the people curse them as \\"Okies\\") and find out that as few as one  man owns as much a million acres--much of it lying fallow in front of their  eyes.<br />As difficult as the plight of the Joads and families like them,  Steinbeck does not paint the Californians or their police as evil so much  as scared into treachery and violence in order to protect their own.  No  one wants to starve and starvation after the dust bowl and thanks to the  exploitative wages paid by the vineyard owners is a very real possibility.  Nor does he canonize the migrants--the societies that grow up by the side  of the road each night have their own laws and lawbreakers, stout hearts  and slatterns--but does show them as civilized people who don't deserve  being treated like animals.  Many fearful Californians don't  agree.<br />Steinbeck's character Tom Joad (whose ghost lives on in a Bruce  Springsteen's song recently covered by Rage Against the Machine) is as  important to American literature as Huckleberry Finn, Holden Caulfield and  Jay Gatsby.  Joad knows life offers no simple solutions, but he also knows  that fair is fair. When a man's employers charge him for his work gear AND  operate the stores where he must buy his food so that he often ends up  OWING his employers more at the end of the week than his pitiful wages can  cover, Tom Joad knows that's not just.  He knows the land is fertile enough  to feed everyone, so don't try giving him any speeches about \\"private  property\\" and \\"supply and demand.\\"  If the test of a system and a society  is how it treats it poorest members (especially in a crisis like the  Depression), then the world the Joads live in fails miserably.<br />No less  strong a character than her son Tom, Ma Joad embodies all the cliches about  being a tower of strength without actually being a clich&eacute; herself.  She and  her family possess all the true grit and hearty spirit America prides  itself on as a nation of pioneers, but by the 1930s the frontier has been  bought up and the pioneers are in desperate straits.<br />This book is  occasionally criticized for being too socialistic.  This criticism is  misguided; what THE GRAPES OF WRATH does is show how capitalism can and  often does enrich the few while the many suffer.  Steinbeck shows how  breadbasket farmers were thrown off the land they had worked for  generations so bankers in the East can make more profit.  Can this happen  today, even in a time of tremendous prosperity?  Ask today's family farmers  what agribusiness has done to them. THE GRAPES OF WRATH is no call to play  the \\"Internationale,\\" but it does starkly and intelligently raise questions  about the meaning of equal opportunity and justice for all.<br />This is a  book that should be required reading for Alan Greenspan, the editors of THE  WALL STREET JOURNAL, and triumphal capitalists everywhere who wince for  their stock dividends when the unemployment rate goes down.

Maybe Tom Robbins's SKINNY LEGS AND ALL is in the same  ballpark (and I've yet to read CATCH-22) but Roth simply had my head  spinning while I read this book.  My jaw is still on the floor, in  fact.<br />Esoterically, this book is one long rant about the joys and (more  heavily) the anguishes of growing up Jewish in America in the forties and  fifties.  It's 1966 and successful civil servant Alexander Portnoy is on  the psychiatrist's couch trying to get out all his Oedipal, inferiority,  and sexual fetish complexes.  <br />That infamous masturbation scene in the  movie AMERICAN PIE?  A direct descendent of Mrs. Portnoy's piece of  liver!<br />More deeply, if you can stand it, this book seriously examines the  struggle of growing up with smothering parents: Alex's both put him on a  pedestal and criticize everything he does.  He's unmarried at thirty-three  in part because of all the neuroses his parents have bestowed in him--so  why doesn't he get married and have children already?  Alex lets us know in  pornographic detail why.  Speaking of pornographic detail, Alex spends  plenty of time on his ultimately doomed affairs with (mostly Protestant)  women.  Most of his anger at growing up Jewish in a Christian-dominated  society he takes out on these &quot;shikses&quot;--variously called  Pumpkin, the Pilgrim and the Monkey--this is not a politically correct book  from the feminist perspective.  It does, however, raise serious questions  about what it means to be a human being, as opposed to just a  hyphenated-American.<br />PORTNOY'S COMPLAINT is brash, profane and wonderful.   It is certainly not for the faint-hearted or those with what were once  considered \\"polite sensibilities.\\"  But it is a very moral book in it's own  way.  Portnoy knows he's no hero, and Roth doesn't portray him as such--in  some ways thebook is one big joke.  Every effective joke has its kernel of  truth; Roth's have the whole can of corn.<br />I never expected a novel that  is one long rant to inspire a review that is one long rave, but there it  is.	2000-07-24

That is all.\\" --Oscar Wilde<br />Often banned by those who consider it \\"immoral,\\" LOLITA is far better than just \\"well  written.\\"  Stylistically, there are few novels in English that match  Nabokov's masterpiece for the seriously playful love and use of language.   And English was at least Nabokov's third tongue!  LOLITA is neither a moral  nor an immoral book.  It is brilliantly written.  But Wilde was slightly  off: that is NOT all.<br />French academic Humbert Humbert comes to America to  renew his life after stagnation and divorce in Paris.  He soon meets the  12-year-old Dolores Haze.  Lolita.  She who reminds him so powerfully of  the young Annabel he so innocently fell in love with on the Riviera when he  was thirteen.  The trouble is, Humbert was thirteen twenty-five years  before and he wants to love Dolores as if he were thirteen again.  It's  just not so innocent this time around, and the fact that he knows this does  not stop him.<br />That LOLITA is a love story cannot be convincingly denied  any more than that it is a twisted tale of illicit, deranged  obsession--novels, like life, often revel in ambiguity.  Nabokov encourages  these multiple shades of gray by employing one of the most enchanting yet  unreliable narrators I've ever encountered.  We see not only his obsessive,  unheathily insatiable lust for the young girl, but also what life with him  does to her: how she cries at night despite her brave front during the day,  how she learns to manipulate him, how she grows to hate him.  How much of  what Humbert says can really be believed?  Trying to figure that out is  part of the enjoyment.<br />The whole book is a story of decadence and  decline, of the beautiful ugliness of corruption.  LOLITA is an aesthetic  dream gone horribly wrong under the bright hot sun of the highways of  middle America.  It is also a treasure of twentieth century literature, a  work of genius in how it persuades us, from time to time, to sympathize  with its charming yet ruthless villain.  But to say that Nabokov endorses  pedophilia would be like saying that Sophocles endorses patricide and  sleeping with one's mother because he wrote OEDIPUS REX.

Scott Fitzgerald's first novel (published when he was twenty-three) is so glitteringly brilliant you might--I say MIGHT--just  like it more than THE GREAT GATSBY.  By the Gatsby masterpiece Fitzgerald  was cutting back deliberately on his flourishing prose--read THIS SIDE OF  PARADISE to see him let it all hang out.<br />Fitzgerald's protagonist Amory  Blaine inherits from his mother exquisite manners, a European sensibility,  and a dangerous superiority complex.  It is to Amory's credit then, that  throughout his prep school and Princeton years he regains the respect his  attitude loses for him through talent and hard work.  His stunning good  looks (a point repeatedly established) position Amory well to lose his  innocence as a variety of beautiful girls fall for him throughout his  adolescence.  Looking back nostalgically later on, Amory is honest enough  with himself to realize that he doesn't really want to \\"repeat\\" his  innocence, but merely \\"want[s] the pleasure of losing it again.\\"<br />When I  first read this book almost four years ago I shook my head after a few  pages and said, \\"there's no accounting for genius.\\"  Much later I read E.

The truth is that there is  accounting for Fitzgerald's genius: it lies in his depth of insight,  sharpness of wit and overall \\"will to bigness,\\" as his narrator puts it for  Amory.  GATSBY is certainly the book that crowned Fitzgerald an immortal,  but THIS SIDE OF PARADISE is a must-read for those who want to know what  first made him a star.	2000-07-01

Stephen Fry's third novel is an interesting and amusing (though not as frightening as he would have it seem) re-imagining of what would have happened had Hitler never been born.  Twenty-four-year-old Cambridge  University history scholar Michael Young has a penchant for the type of  fictional embellishing that Edmund Morris was guilty of in his recent  memoir of Ronald Reagan.  But unlike Morris (and Reagan himself, to some  extent) Young really is a fictional character.  He still has to pay the  price for his creative scholarship (his thesis is rejected by his advisor),  but it is this imaginative sense that bears him up for the journey back in  time to sterilize Hitler's father before the evil seed is ever planted.   <br />I recommend that people read MAKING HISTORY after Fry's two earlier and  more scintillating novels, THE LIAR and THE HIPPOPOTAMUS.  The heaviness of  the subject matter here is slightly out of Fry's hitting zone and I would  hate to have anyone put off perhaps the funniest intellectual writer alive  today.  That said, this is a fine book in its own right and contains an  excellent understanding of academic life (at both Cambridge and Princeton)  and human nature.  Special points, too, for an opening chapter that ranks  among the most screamingly funny in Fry's oeuvre--what would you do if you  woke up late for class and only had decaf in the house?<br />As an avid  Stephen Fry fan I was in no way displeased with this book, I just know that  he has done better work--most recently with the sensational autobiography,  MOAB IS MY WASHPOT.  MAKING HISTORY is not a book for science fiction  connoisseurs, but definitely an ambitious, well-imagined work of literary  merit.  You'll be surprised how much you laugh.	2000-07-01

To finish this book is not to feel uplifted and encouraged for Stephen  Dedalus, but to feel that at least he has made progress and knows enough of  his strengths and weaknesses that he may make something of himself.  Is  this not possibly where we are left at the end of all great coming-of-age  novels?<br />Joyce takes us through five stages of Stephen's youth. As a boy  in 1890's Dublin he hears his father arguing that Irish nationalism has  been sold out by the Catholic clergy.  Soon Stephen's hands are \\"crumpling\\"  beneath the paddle of an unjust priest.  He becomes a leader in his class,  an intellectual in a world where many believe: \\"If we are a priestridden  race we ought to be proud of it. They are the apple of God's eye.\\"  Later  Joyce spends eleven inimitable pages on these apples explaining in  colorfully exhaustive detail what it would be like to be baked in a hellpie  (for God is loving but God's justice is harsh).  Five pages on the physical  tortures of the eternal fire, and six more after a break about the mental  tortures--Dante himself would be impressed.  Fear of hell scares Stephen  sufficiently enough to repent from his teenage brothel-frequenting phase.   He goes to rather interesting extremes of devotion, even considering the  priesthood as a vocation.  But his questioning nature is even too  intellectual for the jesuits and he discovers another path for himself at  and after college. <br />Joyce writes poetic, often urgent prose: \\"To live, to  err, to fall, to triumph, to create life out of life!\\" becomes one of  Stephen's clarion calls.  A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN should be  read by anyone looking for one of the best tales of intellectual, physical  and spiritual awakening we have.  Its beauty is best savored slowly.  The  rhythms might be difficult to pick up at first, but it really won't take  very long until you will have a hard time putting the book down.	2000-06-26

I'm  certainly glad I did so, but not enough to rave like my new idol Nick  Hornby.  While Fielding does give him a run for the money in the giggle  department, BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY doesn't measure up to HIGH FIDELITY in  belly laughs and depth of character.  Nor need it--Bridget is a  deliberately hyperbolized character--take her seriously as a whole and you  miss the point.  Be wary of similarities between her and people you know  and appreciate Fielding's talent for exaggeration.<br />Fielding is very  strong with comic repartee (if only Bridget really had answered the  sneering \\"why aren't you married yet\\" question with the \\"Because I don't  want to end up like you, you fat, boring, Sloaney milch cow\\" that she  swallowed).  Her bits on the Smug Marrieds are none the less poignant and  funny for being obvious--it's just all the booze and cigarette-counting and  weight-watching simply does wear thinner than Bridget herself in the end.   Moreover, Bridget's love story that parallels PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is not  the worthiest homage to Jane Austen.  But if it manages to inspire people  to read that novel--one of the five funniest written in any century--it has  done great and noble service.<br />Bridget Jones doesn't learn as much as she  should, which (while frustrating) is a fine lesson for all of us.  Helen  Fielding has created a memorable fictional character in Bridget Jones.   Expect light, occasionally raucous fun from an intelligent writer--just  don't confuse her with her creation.	2000-06-14

He  worries about keeping his job and meanwhile loathes the self-absorbed  pedant who will decide whether to keep him or not: \\"No other professor in  Great Britain, [Dixon] thought, set such store in being called Professor.\\"   With the axe hanging over his head Dixon falls for the girlfriend of his  boss's son, Bertrand.  A ruthless social-climbing artist, Bertrand is one  of the most intolerable snobs I have come across in literature.  You will  be impressed by Dixon's campaign for the lady Christine-- sometimes carried  on as much to prick Bertrand as to win her affection.  Dixon is a  remarkably funny character, and part of Amis's genius is that we like him  far more than we should.  He starts off rather childish, spitefully  penciling moustache and glasses on a face in someone else's new magazine.   As the plot moves along at an increasingly rapid pace, we see the necessary  defense mechanisms in his many contorted facial expressions and  pseudo-polite manner.  So often does fear or calculation lead him to think  one thing and say the opposite that the moment when he first does say  exactly what he is thinking will move you to stand up and cheer.<br />LUCKY  JIM had me putting it down often--not in boredom or disapproval, oh my,  no!--I just had to pause time and time again to laugh and recover, to let  Amis's brilliance sink in--his deceptively calm tone, his nimble use of the  language.  Occasionally Amis will turn a giggle-inducing phrase in the  style of P.G. Wodehouse, but most of his humor is the unavoidable  belly-aching kind.  Funnier than and just as sharp as Evelyn Waugh, Amis's  influence can be seen--albeit in much wackier fashion--in the 1990s  novels  of Stephen Fry.<br />Not just a comic novel, this, but a work of true and  timeless literary merit.  We shouldn't forget that Amis has Dixon wrestle  with a few demons that are not put down easily by anyone.  But I guarantee  it won't be chance that will have you rolling on the floor if you pick up  LUCKY JIM.	2000-06-13

How fortunate that he had another chance to reacquaint himself with the teacher that had been most  important to him as a college student.  How grateful I was to read this  description of the \\"final thesis\\" between a superior teacher and a  completely invested student.  The wonder of TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE is right  there--in being a completely invested student of Morrie Schwartz, Mitch  Albom becomes better invested in life and in love and less sunk into our  materialistic culture.<br />\\"Death ends a life, not a relationship.\\"  Dying of  Lou Gehrig's disease, Morrie reminds us that we live on through our love.   But our love needs our attention: the people that we love need us to be  \\"fully present.\\"  I saw at least two of Morrie's three interviews with Ted  Koppel and I can still hear his voice, just as I can still hear the voice  of a favorite professor of mine who died four years after I graduated from  college--a rushed hug as I marched by him in my cap and gown was our final  contact.  Morrie helped me forgive myself for that, and I keep in good  touch now with the other teachers who meant the most to me.  That way I  show respect for the legacy of those that I never thanked enough.<br />This  book is short, but neither underdone or overdone.  Nowhere is it flat,  nowhere does it sermonize, per se.  But it is a taught class, and as such  can be didactic.  Take a lesson with Morrie, it doesn't matter how jaded or  cynical you are or you think you are, you will find much that is valuable  in this book.	2000-06-12

Within the universe of the novel, however, no one affirms: it is the realm  of play and of hypotheses.  In the novel, then, reflection is essentially  inquiring, hypothetical.&quot;<br />Thus Milan Kundera affirms the wonder and  beauty of the novel and explains the difference between how philosophers  think and how novelists think.  Born of the Modern Era ushered in by  seventeenth century rationalism, the novel contemplates and explores  existence in the Modern Era.  Like the Modern Era, the novel is  distinguished by its ambiguity and complexity.  For Kundera, the novel's  core is an inquiry, not a moral position.  It makes sense, therefore, that  in a world where humans long for black/white, wrong/right distinction, that  the \\"wisdom of uncertainty\\" which Kundera calls the wisdom of the novel,  should be so hard to accept and understand. <br />This remarkable short book  shares the seven part form of several of Kundera's novels: each can stand  alone but all are connected by vital and pervading themes.  The seven parts  comprise two essays, a collection of notes, two dialogues, a dictionary of  sixty-three words, and an acceptance speech for a literary prize--and not  in the order just mentioned.  This mosaic structure works well to  underscore part of Kundera's point: there are many ways to approach an  understanding of the novel. Is Don Quixote a critique or a celebration of  idealism?  Both cases have been made often, neither is right--the novel's  spirit of complexity and continuity brooks no dogmatism.  In fact, the  novel has its own \\"radical autonomy\\" which Kundera uses to illuminate the  works of Franz Kafka.  It can say and show things humans cannot achieve in  any other way. <br />If the novel that is art--the novel that truly says  something new--is to survive, novelists would do well to think more like  Milan Kundera.  Readers of THE ART OF THE NOVEL, meanwhile, will gain a new  appreciation for the genre as well as valuable insight into the thought  process of one of the world's greatest living novelists.	2000-06-07

Forster gave at Cambridge in 1927.  He departed boldly from convention by trying to get his listeners to picture the great novelists of history  writing at the same time in the same room--this to protect us from the  pseudo-scholarly impulse to classify by period without a careful  exploration of themes.  Who is a psuedo-scholar?  Anyone who \\"loves  mentioning [the] genius [of a novelist], because the sound of the word  exempts him from trying to discover its meaning.\\"  No longer guilty, I  hope!<br />Forster helps facilitate that all-important struggle with the  writer that will give us the most enjoyment and edification from  literature.  He does so by examining seven \\"aspects\\": The Story, People,  The Plot, Fantasy, Prophecy, Pattern and Rhythm.  Examples drawn from the  likes of Sterne, Melville, Joyce, D. H. Lawrence and Henry James help  illustrate his logically and lucid points.  As a practitioner and a critic  of the novel, Forster is both engaged with his topic and engaging in his  exposition.  Highly recommended for both the serious novel reader and the  literature student needing a breather from the oppressiveness of Theory.	2000-06-06

Written in the 1350s, in the wake of the  worst part of the Black Plague (which would kill off one-third of Europe's  population), THE DECAMERON is a collection of one hundred surprisingly  light, hilariously funny and frequently bawdy short stories.  In his  preface, Boccaccio claims to have intended them to entertain Italian women  who spent most of their lives indoors.  Seven young Florentine ladies and  three young gentlemen sojourn together to a Tuscan villa to escape the  contagion-filled city.  They pass each of their ten days in the picturesque  countryside with long walks, good food and wine, jovial games, and oh yes,  telling stories.  Each of them is crowned queen or king for a day and gets  to choose the order of the telling.  This framework combined with the  beautifully described rural setting makes the reader, too, feel warm,  welcome, and one of the party.<br />Boccaccio indulges in a popular form of  satire against the foul and corrupt members of the fourteenth century  clergy--one of the ten actually admits that it's \\"too easy\\" to pick on such  scoundrels.  With humor and the power of shame he attacks both the  hypocrisy of the clergy and the hypocrisy toward which the Catholic  Church's sexually repressive laws drove people.  Here we find a group of  nuns fighting over the sexual favors of the convent gardener; there a wily  cleric indulges his prurient urges by convincing a foolish woman that he is  the Angel Gabriel; still another adulteress cows her angry husband by  claiming he is not enough to satisfy her lust--is it fair that she throw  the surplus to the dogs?  But the prize is taken by the hermit who  persuades a young girl that there's only ONE WAY to fight the devil!  Quite  often one or another of the chaste storytelling party finishes a tale of  illicit pleasureon a note of \\"May we, too, always have our desires  fulfilled.\\"  THE DECAMERON is not all lust and corruption, of course, there  are tales of great bravery and loyalty in the face of high odds.  Great  sacrifices are made, fortunate coincidences occur, true faith is rewarded.  <br />THE DECAMERON is easy to dip into again and again and feel rewarded  every time.  It is impossible to read these wonderful stories without  thinking that Boccaccio was enjoying himself inordinately as he wrote them.   However he may revel in the permissiveness brought on by the terror of the  Plague, much more importantly does he praise life and love and passion as  precious and worth grabbing.  Boccaccio's generation had certainly seen  enough of pain and suffering and death, after all--we should begrudge them  nothing.<br />One of the world's finest literary treasures, THE DECAMERON  belongs on the shelf of everyone who loves great storytelling.	2000-05-17

Lucy Honeychurch is a well-bred young middle class girl on holiday in  radiant Florence.  She comes from a family overconcerned with  respectability and is therefore overprotected by a dessicated spinster  named Charlotte Bartlett.  One wonders if Forster had in mind a more famous  Charlotte B. when he drew Lucy's protector, a woman \\"much discomfited by  [any] unpleasant scene[s].\\" Forster playfully tosses barbs at this  don't-let-the-servants-hear-you world the English try to maintain on  foreign soil.  Less playful with sanctimonious Puritans or hypocritical  clergymen, Forster lets them foil themselves.<br />Under no circumstances will  Miss Bartlett allow Lucy to pursue (or even examine) her affection for the  handsome young George Emerson--his father is far too unconventional with  his modern notions about honesty and freethinking.  Duty must reign . . .  mustn't it?  Ah, that wild transitional phase between the late-Victorians  and the early-Moderns!<br />Forster writes gently and calmly, but with a  passion for life and love welling up beneath the surface.  A ROOM WITH A  VIEW is a lovely book, vital with the force of a sensitive and empathetic  mind.  There's even more to this book than it seems--highly recommended!	2000-05-16

Block writes with a crisp and straightforward  conversational tone.  He's neither chummy nor condescending, and I find his  advice on outlining particularly useful; he always wanted to write, was  someone who started by wanted to see his name in print but who also was  dedicated to the craft.  Block appreciates that what works for him may not  work for everybody, and he offers various examples of productive working  styles, but he stresses that in all cases the successful writer is  dedicated to the PROCESS of writing and understands the importance of  writing steadily.<br />Block considers himself a craftsman.  Those with high  artistic pretensions would be well served to read this book for a dose of  reality.  The reality is that you should enjoy the work of writing,  accepting the fact that \\"getting published\\" may not happen, while realizing  that writing a novel is an amazing learning experience that you will always  prize having done.  One thing the book could use is an update for the  computer word processing age.  Otherwise, highly recommended.	2000-05-15

One reason 17 LIES is likable is because of Chandler's positive attitude that recognizes its positivity.  There's no hyperbole here, no trickery,  just common sense delivered by an aware and incisive writer.  Chandler has  no \\"fear of taking a stand for greatness,\\" as many of us do, and he shreds  those weak-minded or uniformed lies we tell ourselves all the time:  \\"There's nothing I can do,\\" \\"That's just the way I am,\\" and \\"What does not  kill me makes me stronger\\" are my three favorites. <br />Chandler has a  pleasant, open, straightforward style that draws the reader in.  He clearly  is in the self-improvement line for the right reasons and enjoys helping  other people stop deceiving and deluding themselves.  He sincerely and  passionately wants to help.  And help he can.  In a world where enthusiasm  is suspect (and rightly so, as anyone who channel-surfs past the plethora  of infomercials can tell you), Chandler makes an admirable and instructive  new effort to restore enthusiasm.<br />Cliché coming: I almost never read  self-help books.  My soul needs a lot more than chicken soup, but what it  does not need is me lying to it.  When I received the very short 17 LIES as  a gift I had no trouble reading it slowly in less than two-and-a-half  hours.  Chandler is economical and rich at the same time.  I'm sure if he  wanted he could find 17 more lies we tell ourselves (a sequel, perhaps?)  and make it just as useful.  A worthwhile read!	2000-05-15

Home for Denby is his alma mater, Columbia University, where during the 1991-92 academic year  he retook the classic western literature courses that welcomed him to  college thirty years before.  With more than even your average  eighteen-year-old's vigor, middle-aged Denby chronicles his own odyssey of  sitting back down in the classroom and becoming a student again.  The often  amusing classroom scenes are interspersed with insightful commentary on the  cultural scene of the early 1990s, as well as the movie critic's own  musings on how certain of the works were and are tied significantly to  moments and themes of his own life.<br />The book is deeply enriched by  Denby's capacity for wonder, and not harmed all that much by his prominent  ego.  Denby discovers that however much we think of ourselves, the great  writers will always teach us humility--or at least the folly of hubris!   Those who have also taken such courses and read similar works with serious  intent may not agree with all of Denby's critiques, but then examining each  other's interpretations is what we do in literature class and in  life.<br />Though some 460 pages, GREAT BOOKS rarely drags, and left me  wishing it was even longer.  There's no doubt that the author left a part  of himself in college that it was killing him to get back, but he's mature  enough to realize that attempting such reclamation is a doomed venture.  Renewal is what Denby's after, and that's what reading the gargantuan likes  of Homer, Dante and Shakespeare gives us.  With a frank and friendly tone,  Denby does a fresh and impressive job of inspiring this renewal in the  reader.	2000-05-11

Doing so cuts him off  form the snobbish Cricket Clubbers of expatriate English society in  L.A.--they would much rather pay to send him back to the motherland than  have him disgrace them by association.<br />Waugh also takes several good cuts  at the vacuity of American life as exemplified by the heartless film  industry and the garish tackiness of the Whispering Glades cemetery  (complete with piped in sounds of nature)--a place of rest found enduringly  beautiful by Barlow's love interest Aimee Thanatogenos.  This mortuary  cosmetician's name translates roughly as `The Loved One, who gives Life to  Death.  No need for subtlety here as far as Waugh is concerned--this is  Tinseltown, after all.  More fun names: the virtuoso mortician also in love  with Aimee is \\"Joyboy\\" and the advice columnist at the local paper who  replies to her several entreaties is \\"Mr. Slump.\\"<br />The characters don't  offer much to redeem themselves, but that's the point, and Waugh doesn't  waste any pages getting it across.  Whether you have gone through the  process of making funeral arrangements or not, THE LOVED ONE will prepare  you for the sales pitch of \\"Before Need Arrangements\\" and various other  details you weren't crazy about knowing but that are dealt with in such a  funny, hyperbolized way here by Waugh.  \\"A Warning\\" recommends that  \\"squeamish [readers] should return their copies to the library or bookstore  unread.\\"  What a silly thing to do that would be.	2000-05-09

In many ways this is an experimental novel, the seven different parts of the book are compared by the author to Beethoven's variations upon a musical theme.  These different variations either describe, converge upon, or dance around  the story of Tamina, a Czech exile who ran away from the communists with  her husband only to see him die of disease soon afterward.  As time passes  she becomes obsessed with the mortal fear that she will forget him.  She  cannot go back to her homeland but she can try to get her husband's love  letters back, to bring some of his laughter back into her life, to remind  her that she is not alone.<br />Tamina's homeland meanwhile, still languishes  and suffers under the boot of the Soviet Union.  The intellectuals who were  so excited about communism in the late 1940s can't believe how wrong it  goes over the next twenty years and try to correct their mistake.  But the  Soviets will have none of their \\"stalking a lost deed\\" as Kundera calls  it--just as the Czechs are succeeding in relaxing the strictures of  totalitarianism, in storm the Soviet tanks in 1968, ending the \\"Prague  Spring\\" and delaying freedom in Eastern Europe for another twenty-one  years. <br />Published in 1978, three years after Kundera escaped the Iron  Curtain and set down new roots in France, this book is also an important  historical document. (I actually read it for the first time as an  assignment for a 20th Century European history class in college in  1991--I'm still grateful to the professor.)  It is important because it  warns us of the insidious dangers of \\"forgetting.\\"  One of the first things  the communists did after crushing the Prague Spring was to fire some one  hundred forty-five Czech historians from the universities in an attempt to  erase the memory of the people.  It is frightening how well they might have  succeeded if the Soviet economy had stayed strong for another generation or  two. <br />THE BOOK OF LAUGHTER AND FORGETTING is touching and erotic, a  moving and inspired intellectual feat.  It is not humorous, but if you are  open to the experience, it will inspire \\"serious laughter, laughter beyond  joking.\\" Kundera has a gentle, straightforward style that evokes rich and  vivid images (at least as translated by Michael Henry Heim--I look forward  to reading Aaron Asher's in the future).  For anyone who has loved, for  anyone who has a memory, for anyone who appreciates the freedom we have in  this society, THE BOOK OF LAUGHTER AND FORGETTING is a must.	2000-04-28

Written during World War II and framed by the conversion of the Brideshead estate into an army camp during the war, the novel depicts the youth and early adulthood of one Charles Ryder.  The 40-year-old army  captain that the war makes of Ryder recalls the days of his optimistic  youth as a close friend of teddy-bear toting Sebastian Flyte, younger son  of the Brideshead household and classmate of his at Oxford.  Sebastian  awakens much in Charles, and it is arguable whether he doesn't awaken more  than does his sister Julia, who later becomes Ryder's fiancee.<br />For the  220 or so pages that constitute Part One this book comes off as a splendid  (though not aggressively hostile) satire of upper class British society in  the 1920s.  Especially of the particular damage that the \\"long-suffering\\"  Catholic mother can do to her loved ones (I kept thinking, \\"O, the  martyrdom!\\" every time Lady Marchmain used one of her patented guilt trips  to twist the psychological and spiritual arms of her children--Sebastian  most often.)  BRIDESHEAD REVISITED is also a powerful \\"lost illusions\\" type  of novel, but the particular illusions lost don't seem any more attractive  than the reality that replaces them. \\"Henceforth I live in a world of three  dimensions--with the aid of my five senses,\\" says Charles, but that seems  limiting, doesn't it?  It does to Waugh but his answer isn't necessarily  any more appealing. Part One is hilarious and promises much.  Part Two,  sorry to say, does not deliver on that promise.  The satire stops and the  soap opera begins.  Sebastian disappears and Ryder becomes a much less  sympathetic character--why he would fall in love with Julia in the first  place is hard to fathom.<br />A great problem with this novel is that it seems  to place the Catholic religion in an unflattering light to the extent that  the reader would think that Waugh himself was anti-Catholic.  Think again.   He was a convert well before he wrote this book and despite the fact that  he DOES present Catholicism as being the last thing anyone would want to  fall into, people fall.  The fact that they fall into rather than embrace  Catholicism sucks away whatever joy might have been left in the novel--I  was reminded of the line from Kevin Smith's movie DOGMA, paraphrased here:  \\"Catholics don't celebrate their faith, they mourn it.\\"<br />So, in  celebration I must say that to call Waugh a fine writer is to sell him far  too short.  He is a masterful stylist and a brilliant wit who can lift you  up and get under your skin.  Let him.	2000-04-26

This is true of many of the best novels, but Pynchon's 1965 hit would have to be more compelling on  the first read to warrant further examination.  There's a lot going on in  this short novel, but not much to care about, despite the mystery of the  \\"Tristero,\\" a band of secret and ancient European marauders that exist to  destroy private postal routes (do you think they had anything to do with  that UPS strike a couple of years back?).  Our heroine is Oedipa Maas, but  she betrays no indication of swollen feet or patricidal tendencies.  She  and her ancient royal namesake do, however, share the same flaw of HAVING  to know the truth, however much damage it does to them.  Oedipa at least  gets to keep her eyes, for all the good they do her.  See--just keep  peeling back the layers and there might be something grand to this book  after all.<br />Oedipa is launched on the Tristero mystero by the last will  and testament of her ex-boyfriend (Pierce Inverarity--dust off your old  Latin primers) which names her co-executrix.  This requires a trip to \\"San  Narciso\\"--cute, especially when one of the first things she does there is  break a looking glass.  And we're off and flying around the room like the  aerosol can that shatters the mirror.  Pynchon likes to have fun with  character names, too (I kept picturing Oedipa's husband Mucho Maas as  Roberto Duran--not fair to the author as Sugar Ray Leonard must still have  been in high school when this book was written): Dr. Hilarius, Genghis  Cohen, Mike Fallopian, all pretty rich.  So we know we're dealing with  something on a different plane, or, considering the amount of LSD and Jack  Daniels in the book, a different trip.<br />I'm all for stylized prose, and  Pynchon is certainly no slouch at turning a phrase--but the overall effect  seems more obfuscatory than revealing of much insight into human natureor  the early-sixties California lifestyle.  His characters are acid-paper  cut-outs and the plot left me not as interested as I wanted to be by the  end.  The parts of THE CRYING OF LOT 49 are greater than the whole, but  perhaps that's the point.	2000-04-22

By giving animation to lifeless tissue Victor Frankenstein  ascends to a peak of biblical and mythological proportions: he becomes a  Creator like the God of Genesis, and parallels the Greek Prometheus in  giving humankind a gift that has both marvelous and catastrophic  consequences.<br />The furor of the Being after Frankenstein abandons it in  disgust and horror sharply contrasts with the lovely Alpine village  setting.  Shelley paints the countryside of Frankenstein's homeland with  such warm and green colors that the reader longs to live in such a  paradise.  A family ardent in their devotion to him further enriches  Victor's world.  Only doom remains, however, when the Creature knows it  cannot enjoy this love and beauty and determines that Frankenstein is to  blame.<br />Shelley, herself the creator as author, generates an organic whole  by depicting the Being as more than just organic matter: she stresses the  juxtaposition of creator and created, engaging them in dialogue together  about the responsibilities one has toward the other.  This face-off is one  of the most memorable in literature.  FRANKENSTEIN is a novel of both  immense beauty and horrifying ugliness, and, as in life, it's all more than  skin deep.	2000-03-29

Its brevity contrasts with the longer works for which Dickens is more famous, and its satiric skewering of rampant  capitalism leaves an imprint on the reader's mind not soon  forgotten.<br />Dickens holds up Thomas Gradgrind for us, Sir, a singular  member of the industrial community of \\"Coketown,\\" a man who is so obsessed  with Facts that he never allows his children to Feel.  They are to \\"discard  the word Fancy altogether.\\" To ensure this strict materialistic philosophy,  the children are taught by a schoolmaster named \\"McChoakumchild.\\"  In  Gradgrind's friend Josiah Bounderby Dickens gives us possibly the most  layered, complete and abhorrent hypocrite in all of English literature.   Moliere's Tartuffe is the height of sincerity compared with Bounderby, who  seems really to have convinced himself of his own myth after many years of  browbeating others with his pompous false modesty.  The fact that he is a  factory owner who mercilessly exploits his workers only makes him the less  endearing.  And this is the man Tom Gradgrind gives his daughter to in  marriage!<br />The book's narrator clearly distinguishes the good guys from  the bad guys, all in an effective effort to show that humans need to  appreciate sentiment and sympathy much more than they need to worship  dollars and cents.  In 1854 HARD TIMES showed the triumphalist British  industrialists their dark side.  It stands today as a treasured statement  against cost-benefit ratios and anti-intellectualism in a world where CEOs  \\"earn\\" $10 million bonuses the same week 4,000 workers lose their jobs.  It  will stand tomorrow anywhere people are scorned for showing their feelings,  beaten down in body and spirit, or victimized by rank injustice.	2000-03-25

Will Freeman's name alone should indicate sufficiently where his  character is coming from--he's jazzy, he's today, he's independently  wealthy--heck, he's almost archetypal \\"men's-magazine cool.\\"  Sub-zero Will  may be, but ah, that's about as far as his life's ambition impels, so don't  ask him to be godfather to your child.  That independent wealth thing, as  many of us could stand to risk finding out, cuts both ways.  Will's not  rich, mind you, it's just that his breezy middle class lifestyle simply  doesn't require that he work--he lives off the royalties of a Christmas  song his late father wrote.  It stands to reason that he cringes at hearing  \\"Santa's Super Sleigh\\" and would just as soon give the holidays a  miss.<br />But Will is not the \\"boy\\" of the title--not really, anyway.  The  boy is Marcus--twelve-year-old son of an overly sincere,  political-vegetarian, Joni Mitchell fan of a depressed single mom that  won't let him be a kid.  The book is the story of Marcus and Will's  friendship and the two are actually dual protagonists--Hornby does a fine  job balancing their perspectives with a third person narrator limited in  omniscience to the two of them.  Marcus is a strange kid who is done no  favors by his strange mother.  He is also a lonely and tormented pre-teen,  but still has the wherewithal to blackmail Will into a friendship. This  after he finds out that Will pretended to have a child just to meet single  moms.  As you can see, theses two don't have your typical Big Brother  program relationship.<br />Hornby masterfully--and without seeming to exert  himself--conveys the world that both Marcus and Will have to grow up in.   His secondary characters aren't as fleshed out as some might desire, but  nor are they the stereotypes you might find strolling the sidewalks in any  given city.  ABOUT A BOY isa sharply written, fun-to-read tale about the  inevitability of engaging with life.  It doesn't surpass HIGH FIDELITY, but  this book sure does live up to it admirably. Give us more, Mr Hornby!	2000-03-13
US	51901277	RV6SKW7T2GIT2	1569470545	56387718	Hippopotamus	Books	5	34	36	N	N	Dazzling, Rich and Rewarding	THE HIPPOPOTAMUS is the second and best of Stephen Fry's three novels.  If you have read and enjoyed THE LIAR or MAKING HISTORY you will adore this book.  If you enjoyed THE LIAR but were frustrated by it's poorly contrived  ending you just may want to make love to THE HIPPOPOTAMUS.  Fry's wit is  razor sharp yet hearty, his humor will slap you in the face and then give  you a hug.  It is rare these days to stop reading just because you have to  laugh so hard, then sit quietly for a moment pondering the art, craft or  trick of genius that made you laugh so hard before laughing again.  Fry is  an artist, a craftsman, and a supremely clever rhetorician with quite a few  tricks up his sleeve.<br />Fry's protagonist here is much the different fellow  from the twentyish Adrian Healey of THE LIAR.  Ted Wallace is sixty-six  years old, \\"an unregenerate snob,\\" and a once notable and occasionally  anthologized minor poet, whose physical form in motion \\"resembles in sight  and sound nothing so much as a bin-liner full of yoghurt.\\"  His mental form  has not been all it's cracked up to be either, the story opens with his  dismissal with cause from his theatre reviewing job: he was shouting out  his criticisms while the performance was still in progress.  Just when it  looks like malt whiskey-induced cirrhosis can't be far down the road, his  long-lost goddaughter offers him a chance at redemption.  A chance he'd  never take were it not for the hefty check she gives him to perform the  task from which the rest of the book derives it suspense--visiting the  summer house of his other godchild, younger son of an incredibly rich and  powerful former British army reserve buddy, and reporting back on the  mystical goings on there.  And what twisted fun we have accompanying him on  this summer in the high country!<br />As a story, THE HIPPOPOTAMUS  demonstrates a handsome integration of the accidental and the intentional.   It is happily free from contrivance, and is made all the morehilarious and  alive by its being written, for the most part, in letter form.  Fry also  finds a few well-placed moments to proclaim his own theory of art: \\"It is  the only thing that not only cannot be disproved, but can actually and  tangibly and incontrovertibly proved.\\"  Damn the psychotherapists, priests  and druids all to Vienna, Hell, and Avalon--give a man Shakespeare and he  will be saved!<br />Fry's style is richly allusive and admirably erudite.  It  also savagely satirizes its own pretentiousness.  Fry has it both ways and  knows it--not a bad trick.  THE HIPPOPOTAMUS is both bestial fun and  glorious art.  If you can handle both, this book is simply not to be  missed.	2000-02-22

Franken himself on page 87: \\"I'm making  fun of meanness in public debate by being mean myself.  It's called  `irony.'  Perhaps you've heard of it?\\"  Hmm, Al, I'm not sure everyone has.   Franken's task as a satirist in RUSH LIMBAUGH IS A BIG FAT IDIOT is to  pick out the blatant hypocrisies and idiocies of the Republican right and  hold them up to the ridicule blatant hypocrisies and idiocies so richly  deserve.  That is the book's intention, and it succeeds on nearly every  page.  The funniest moment, however, is when Franken describes the thrill  of playing touch football with the President--if you know just a little  about football, you will laugh for four quarters after reading what Franken  does.<br />I submit that Franken, professional satirist that he is, could be  just as funny if he set his sights on the left--no shortage of material  there, either.  But his targets are the Limbaughs, Buchanans, Ralph Reeds,  Gingriches and Pat Robertsons of the world because they, as he says, \\"are  always 100 percent sure of what they're saying.\\"  Well, if you brook no  contradiction, whether arrogantly or psuedo-humbly (the same thing), and  you can be proven to be wrong here and there, you may as well paint a big  red and white bull's-eye on your chest.

This is the book that helped  corrupt Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray.  The main character Des Esseintes, a  wealthy French dandy, grows bored of society and shuts himself up from the  world.  He soon bores himself, and I am sorry to say, too often bores the  reader.  One cannot say it is not a creative boredom, however.  Artifice  reigns supreme for Des Esseintes: \\"Nature...has had her day.\\"  Our anti-hero  is exactly the type who would decide after a visit to EPCOT's international  pavilion in Florida, that there was no longer any need to visit Europe:  \\"After all, what was the good of moving, when a fellow could travel so  magnificently sitting in a chair?\\"  Des Esseintes is the prototypical couch  potato--if they had had television in 1884, we wouldn't have this  book.<br />Virtually alone in his villa, Des Esseintes tries to cultivate  every possible sensation artificially--in art, liqueurs, books, interior  decoration, food, perfumes--he even tries to enjoy his illnesses.  Huysmans  seems to show, by the nature of his game, Des Esseintes cannot succeed.   His desires always surpass his capacity for enjoyment; his constitution is  weak and his nerves grow frail.<br />Huysmans gives us an overwhemingly  detailed picture of why we aren't all decadents given up to the pleasure  principle today--sheer tedium.  There are flashes of brilliance and  insight, to be sure, but they are dulled by the intimate picture of  over-satiety.  No more than three random chapters will be enough for the  interested aesthete to get the point.	2000-02-01

Few readers  liked it then, they found it dark and depressing after a certain point;  they wanted the entertainment they were used to from London (&quot;Come on,  Jack, give us another story with dogs and snow in it!&quot;).  Not as many  read it now as should, and London himself disdained the fact that it  inspired many young writers without talent to follow Martin Eden's example.   But it is also a valuable story about a young man maturing in his  conception of love as regards the opposite sex:<br />\\"Ambition soared on mad  wings, and he saw himself climbing the heights with her, pleasuring in  beautiful and noble things with her.  It was a soul-possession he dreamed,  refined beyond any grossness, a free comradeship of spirit that he could  not put into definite thought.\\"   -- The youth becomes a man.<br />London's  prose is straightforward and vibrant, much like the author at his best.   Martin Eden falls victim to the vicissitudes of his fame and fortune, much  like the author at his worst (too much hard living is often given as the  reason for London's death at forty).  London spends a lot of time in this  book criticizing American materialism in the way that materialism ought to  be criticized.  He also displays a certain kind of American work ethic  (five hours of sleep a night, perseverance through failure, etc.) that  sometimes doesn't know what to do with itself once it achieves success.  We  should all have that problem--just hope that we deal with it better than  young Martin Eden does.  A very worthwhile read.	2000-02-01

People in flow are completely focused; self-consciousness and the awareness of time give way  to full immersion in the moment.  We usually attain flow when faced with  clear and challenging goals that stretch our abilities without overtaxing  them.  Most often people have \\"flow experiences\\" when they engage in their  favorite activities, whether playing or working. Csikszentmihalyi suggests  that by paying close attention to what we do every day, and how we feel  doing it, we can learn to maximize these positive moments and thus improve  our psychic well-being.<br />FINDING FLOW is not a sappy, vacuous self-help  book for the masses--it reminds us intelligently, without cheerleading or  condescension, that complaining about a lack of time is a common excuse for  not taking control of our lives.  It also tells us something we have often  heard, but love to forget: flow comes when we have goals, not because  achieving them is necessarily important, but because a lack of goals leads  to a struggle to concentrate and avoid distractions. This passage reminded  me of what my favorite classics professor once told us: \\"Without Ithaka,  there is no Odyssey.\\"  <br />Many great thinkers of the past (Homer, Carlyle,  Dr. Seuss) have one way or another said what Csikszentmihalyi says; few  have focused on happiness as happiness so successfully, and in so few  pages.

Wharton's narrator is sharply critical of the characters she describes; the words  from the writer's pen often seem like arrows shot from a well-aimed bow.   Her critical sharpness never really descends into the pit of cynicism,  however; besides, what most people consider cynical is merely someone  else's honest attempt to see things as they are.  Her characters are human,  they have their noble and mean aspects, but as a rule they don't give each  other credit for the good that is within them--all must be imposed from the  outside, by religion or meddling mothers or fear of losing one's economic  status.  It is this tyranny of society that Wharton both understands and  shreds to pieces so well.  We are all hypocrites to one degree or another;  some people get it, others do not--Wharton clearly \\"gets it.\\"<br />Wharton  skillfully uses her protagonist, Newland Archer, to depict the soul's  wrestling match between conventional expectations and individual freedom.   Her supporting characters are colorfully drawn, if not fleshed out as much  as fans of Henry James may prefer.  Wharton admired James intensely, and  although a professor of mine once called her \\"a poor man's James,\\" she is  better thought of as a rich woman's Wharton.  She did indeed pattern THE  AGE OF INNOCENCE after James' less popular novel, THE AMBASSADORS, and she  takes up themes of desire, freedom, renunciation and regret with a more  generous and witty spirit than he.	2000-01-17

One may intelligently disagree  with some of Loewen's interpretations, though because he quotes from  primary sources that their high school textbooks ignored (which by their  nature as primary sources are difficult to pass off without some degree of  rational thought), many will inevitably lash out with righteous  half-blindness against him.  The more enlightened will either agree or  object, but will in either case certainly thank Loewen for doing all the  work of slogging through these monster tomes and sparking a vitally  important discussion.  Loewen encourages precisely that intelligent  exchange of ideas that can most benefit our society.<br />Loewen doesn't want  to burn all the textbooks, he wants to show how limited they are by their  very nature.  What he does want to do, and shouldn't we all, is to correct  some of the vast number of errors of both omission and comission these  books make--not correct \\"politically,\\" but correct \\"factually.\\" This is a  very brave book in that it takes on some of the grand myths of our culture,  e.g., Columbus, the first Thanksgiving, Woodrow Wilson's idealism, often  bursting their fanciful bubbles.  It adds to our underfed knowledge and  tries to stir up an interest in history that clearly isn't being done in  the majority of classrooms in this country.  Moreover, LMTM does not claim  to be the last word on the topics it investigates.<br />Loewen writes well and  sometimes passionately about facts that don't care what we think about  them.  He is a crusader against ignorance, but he lacks neither a sense of  humor nor an appreciation for the many layers of irony that confront us as  both individuals and members of society.  LMTM can be read straight  through, or dipped into--jump around and enjoy.

Macbeth is a warrior who has just had his greatest victory, but his own \\"vaulting ambition,\\" the spectral promises of the three weird  sisters, and the spurring on of his wife drive him to a treason and  miserable destruction for which he himself is completely responsible.  The  ominous imagery of the fog that hovers over the first scene of the play  symbolizes the entire setting of the play.  Shakespeare's repeated  contrasts of such concepts as fair and foul, light and darkness, bravery  and cowardice, cut us to the quick at every turn.  MACBETH forces us to  question \\"what is natural?\\" \\"what is honor?\\" and \\"Is life really `a tale/  Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury/ Signifying nothing?'\\"  Few plays  have ever illustrated the torments of Guilt (especially how it deprives one  of Sleep) so vividly and stirringly.<br />I have read this play curiously as a  child, excitedly as a teenager, passionately as a college student, and  lovingly as a graduate student and adult.  Like all of Shakespeare's  writing, it is still as fresh, and foreboding, and marvelous as ever.  As a  play it is first meant to be heard (cf. Hamlet says \\"we shall hear a  play\\"), secondarily to be seen (which it must be), but, ah, the rich  rewards of reading it at one's own pace are hard to surpass.  Shakespeare  is far more than just an entertainer: he is the supreme artist of the  English language.  The Arden edition of MACBETH is an excellent scholarly  presentation, offering a bounty of helpful notes and information for both  the serious and casual reader.	2000-01-13

I first read this book in 1994, less than a year out of college--perfect timing for Chabon's tale of what can happen to educated middle class kids during that summer when adulthood is first thrust upon them. It's still fresh. Life isn't all stress and misery, though it sure can get weird. Americans of Chabon's generation (X, that is, to use the now passe term), grew up used to a lot of weirdness, and probably too much existential angst--ah, but we had pop culture to soothe ourselves with. And let's not forget those who chose to numb themselves with mind-altering substances. One cool thing about Chabon's protagonist, Art Bechstein, is that he didn't let pop culture consume him--even if it does make him act out his life as if it were all on screen.<br />Chabon's style is inviting and amusing from the first paragraph. His facility and playfulness with the language is always invigorating and sometimes awe-inspiring--he's clearly a better verbal artist than Hornby. THE MYSTERIES OF PITTSBURGH is a winner all around!	2000-01-08

But the payoff is worth the effort, however we may begrudge James' frustratingly and intentionally  thick prose.  James does indeed describe intense human situations in great  depth and detail:  duty, honor, nostalgia; the contrast between the  starchy-collared stiffness of Brahmin Boston (read: America) contrasted  with the joie de vivre of Paris (read: Europe); how difficult certain of  life's choices can be.  These are just a few themes that make this book  worthwhile.  James' America is young and trying to assert itself (and so  takes itself too seriously); his Europe is old and satisfied (and perhaps  doesn't take itself seriously enough).<br />Lambert Strether, a fiftysomething  turn-of-the-20th-century bourgeois Bostonian gentleman on an aristocratic  lady's errand--she will not marry him until he convinces her son Chad to  return to Massachusetts.  We see his struggle with his uncomfortable  position when he realizes Chad is no longer a spoiled young prep-schooler,  but a young gentleman of increasing refinement and self-awareness.  And if  Strether is anything, by the way, he is one of the most supremely  self-aware characters in literary history.  Once that Paris air starts to  play its magic with Strether himself, we are off to the races.  Keeping in  mind, of course, that with James' prose we are racing with tortoises. James  invites us to ponder how many chances a person truly gets in this life to  reinvent his or her self?  And if we get the chance, do we always take it?   How much should we weigh the consequences before we decide?  How much are  we willing to accept them after we have chosen?<br />For similar themes with  clearer, faster-paced, and wittier prose, try Edith Wharton's marvelous  homage to James, THE AGE OF INNOCENCE.	2000-01-06

Before we even know where this list is going to lead, we know  protagonist Rob Fleming is going to be a guy after many of our hearts. He  is the kind of guy that pays extremely close attention to his relationships  with women, is always looking for that \\"perfect\\" girlfriend (in the sense  of perfect for him), and if pressed just a bit, could readily produce the  names of every girl that ever deigned to kiss him romantically on the lips.  Not that this is a good thing, but it's just something we can do, kind of  like being able to rattle off the last ten NCAA basketball champions.  Self-obsessed? Sure. Recognizable? Like the sun in the sky.<br />Rob is a  35-year-old North London record shop owner who never recovered from the  toughest of those five break-ups--the one that stunned him right out of  college. He knows his chosen musical genres obsessively, but no longer  quite as obsessively as his employees, the overbearing Barry and timid  Dick. The shop and his music, however, seem to make up Rob's whole world,  and he is not comfortable outside them. Nor is he happy with himself  outside of a monogamous relationship. So why (consciously or not) does he  always sabotage them? Following Rob as he seeks the answer to this question  can be hilarious and sad and rejuvenating.<br />Hornby's prose is consistently  keen of wit and often raucously funny. Because there's just so much  literature out there I want to experience, I almost never re-read books. I  read HIGH FIDELITY twice in six weeks--Nick Hornby taught me how silly I  was.	2000-01-04
US	51901277	ROB28GAIC9012	156947012X	835538748	The Liar	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Snappingly, Cracklingly, Poppingly Funny	Stephen Fry writes jaunty, superbly clever and often belly-achingly funny prose.  Much of it can be called irreverent, but only by the irredeemably Puritan.  Fry has a sharp sense of human nature, a tender spot for human  frailty, and his crosshairs trained on human cruelty.<br />Fry's protagonist  (and, so it seems, shadow self), Adrian Healey goes forth in the world of  the English public schools, English public houses and English public  streets as best he can--most often his best requires  an assiduous  disregard for the truth.  But his lies are \\"lived and felt and acted out as  thoroughly as another man's truths.\\"  This book doesn't have everything,  but it does have international espionage, campus comedy and figgy oatcakes.   Unfortunately, it doesn't have an organic or convincing ending, but five  stars doesn't have to mean \\"perfect.\\"<br />If you have ever fancied the idea  that there is more truth in fiction than in history, this is the book for  you.  If descriptions of human sexual affection put you off unless they are  of a married man and woman under the covers with the lights out, then you  may turn a shade or three of red with THE LIAR.  Honestly!    If you like  this book, Fry's second novel, THE HIPPOPOTAMUS, is even more hilarious  (and much better plotted).	1999-12-31
US	51901277	RRQKOGIQOKUOO	039575514X	584095688	My Antonia	Books	5	17	18	N	N	Nostalgia, Beauty, and Friendship	In MY ANTONIA Willa Cather does an extraordinary job of showing a true struggle with the weight of the personal nostalgic impulse.  Jim Burden is unfulfilled in his life as a New York husband and lawyer, a predicament  that his many travels near the Nebraska he grew up in do not alleviate. His  most powerful memories center around the Bohemian immigrant girl Antonia.   The story is really about their relationship rather than either individual:  Cather's depiction of Jim's friendship with Antonia as a child, a young  adult, and then a man shows how both Jim and the novel reconcile and  transcend the combination of place, time and fortune.  Written primarily  from Jim's perspective, the story helps him regain a vital measure of the  fulfillment he has lost in the over twenty years he spends away from his  roots.  It's hard to go home again, and often we don't when we should, but  Cather reminds us that home is not strictly a matter of geography: the  people we carry in our hearts mean more to us than any street address ever  can.<br />Cather's pen paints vivid and detailed pictures of the landscape and  complex, well-rounded characters to people it.  I could not finish this  book when it was assigned for summer reading in high school; it didn't grip  me.  Reading it twelve years later, with my childhood gone and a dozen  years more life experience and memories, I found it not only gripping, but  stirring and beautiful.	1999-12-27
US	51901277	R1B8D9XK0XC9K4	0064471195	607344832	The Chronicles of Narnia Boxed Set	Books	4	67	70	N	N	The Original Order Is VITAL Upon The First Reading	THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA were the most wonderful and important books I read as a child. I am still upset by this set HarperCollins has published in the last few years that has re-ordered the seven volumes chronologically  based on the historical line in the novels.  This is apparently according  to Lewis's wishes, if so, Lewis was wrong!  The best part of the series was  reading \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" sixth and discovering with a beautiful and  never-replicated surprise about all the things that happened before \\"The  Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe.\\" (See several reviews below that already  say this better.) By all means buy these books for your children,  godchildren, nieces and nephews, but PLEASE, specify that the FIRST time  they read them that they read them in the original order: LWW, PC, VDT, SC,  HHB, MN, LB.  They will reread them for the rest of their lives, in every  possible order, but something great and beautiful and unsurpassed will be  stolen from them if they read The Magician's Nephew first.	1999-12-16
