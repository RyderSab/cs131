Meletios Webber does an excellent job of summarizing his own work:<br /><br />\\"This book has two main purposes: The first is to explore the Twelve Steps of the Fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous, to explain them to those who may be unfamiliar with them, and to show why the Steps are important in helping people recover from alcoholism (and from other addictive conditions).<br /><br />\\"The second purpose of this book is to present the Twelve Steps in such a way that members of the Orthodox Church might find them a valuable resource for their own personal spiritual development, should they choose to use them. Furthermore, even though most of the issues discussed will be illustrated using examples from the life of the Orthodox Church, it is hoped that members of other Christian traditions may also find this material helpful as they continue on their spiritual journey.\\"<br /><br />This book succeeds in achieving both purposes admirably.<br /><br />When I began reading this volume, over a year ago, I had a nodding acquaintance with Alcoholics Anonymous and Twelve Step programs. Over the course of the past year, thanks largely to the reading of this book, I have become more personally acquainted with Twelve Step programs, and have learned about their effectiveness in changing the lives of countless individuals.<br /><br />Not only that, but as I've talked with participants in various Twelve Step programs, I've encountered individuals whose spiritual journey resembles the disciplines I've been trying to incorporate in my own life for many years.<br /><br />It's amazing to discover how this remarkable program is based on the tried and true disciplines of ancient Christian spirituality, such as acknowledging one's powerlessness over addictive behaviors (sin); that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us (dependence on God); make a decision to turn our will and lives over to God; made a searching and fearless moral inventory; admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs (confession); were ready to remove defects of character (repentance), etc.<br /><br />This is a remarkable book (dare I say \\"life-changing?\\"). It is easy to read, it explains AA and Twelve Steps as well as anything else I've read on the subject to date. It's a great introduction for the curious, especially for those who identify themselves as Christians. There's no need to be Orthodox to derive benefits from this excellent volume, and for those who may be interested in learning more about Orthodoxy, it will give some very practical insight into the spirituality of the Orthodox Christian faith.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

Erickson, is part of the \\"Religion in American Life\\" series published by Oxford University Press. What I appreciate about this series, as opposed to similar ones by other publishers, is that they have asked a uniquely qualified Orthodox Christian scholar to tell the story of his people. Other series have often been written \\"by committee,\\" or by an outside observer, which cause them to lack the author's enthusiasm for his or her subject.<br /><br />The Orthodox Christian faith has often been described as \\"the best kept secret in America.\\" This text goes a long way to explain why that is the case, and also why it should not be the case.<br /><br />The opening chapter, \\"An Ancient Faith in the New World,\\" is perhaps the best summary of the history of the Orthodox faith (all 2,000 years) that I have ever read. The next chapter, \\"Entrepreneurs and Missionaries,\\" provides an excellent introduction to the first Orthodox activity in the New World, namely in Alaska, and California.<br /><br />The chapter that follows, \\"A Church of Immigrants,\\" discusses the influx of immigrants that began in the 19th century, from Greece, Russia and Arab Christian communities. The succeeding chapter, \\"The Ethnic Churches,\\" describes how a precarious Orthodox Christian unity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave way to ethnic jurisdictions with new ties to the Mother Churches, largely because of the impact of the Bolshevik Revolution on the Russian Orthodox Church.<br /><br />The final chapter, \\"The Quest for Unity,\\" describes the development of various cooperative efforts of new agencies since the 1950s which give a glimpse of hope for a unified Orthodox body one day in America.<br /><br />I've been a member of the Orthodox Church since 1999, the year this book was published, and I'm surprised that it's taken me this long to read it. I now think it should be essential reading for both converts like myself, and \\"cradle Orthodox,\\" who would like a clearer understanding of how we got where we are today in North America. But be forewarned, this book covers, however briefly, the good, the bad and the ugly, of our history in the New World.<br /><br />I also think this volume would be of interest to those investigating the Orthodox faith, or for those who are interested in the history of Christianity in North America. But I would not recommend this be the first book someone reads on Orthodoxy, which is covered more completely in \\"The Orthodox Church,\\" by Timothy (Bishop Kallistos) Ware, and similar volumes.who would like a clearer understanding of how we got where we are today in North America.

Todd Strasser's gripping account of a fictional incident at Middletown High School does not give the answer, but suggests a number of contributing factors.<br /><br />As a high school librarian, this book is causing me to pay more attention to the cliques, clubs and loners on our campus. I encourage teens and adults to read this, especially if you're concerned about bullying and school violence.<br /><br />It's no secret that Strasser has an agenda favoring gun control, but his narrative and numerous footnotes provide a convincing argument to seriously consider this alternative. It's obvious that this is not the only thing that needs to change, but it would be a step in the right direction.	2005-06-20

McGuckin has assembled and translated hymns from the Early Church from both the Greek and Latin traditions.<br /><br />Starting with hymns from the New Testament, such as \\"Hymn to the Creative Word\\" (from John 1), McGuckin breathes new life into these ancient texts by setting them in contemporary English free verse. On each facing page the reader will find the text to the original Greek or Latin. (He even provides a pronunciation guide to Byzantine Greek, for those who would like to read it in the original language.)<br /><br />This is a beautiful collection, one that could used for private prayers, or simply to read these rich ancient texts as poetry. One could even chant them to get a sense of the musical beauty of these words.<br /><br />This volume begins with an introduction in which McGuckin explains the role of hymnody in the Early Church, how he made some of the selections, what sources he used, and his reasoning behind some of the translations. In the end notes at the back of the book one can find additional comments on each individual hymn. The book closes with a list of primary sources and a select bibliography.<br /><br />This little volume (102 pages) is recommended for those who wish to read Early Church poetry and hymnody, for those who are involved in the liturgical life of the Church, for those who wish to enrichen their prayer life, or for those who are simply interested in Church history.	2005-02-19

It is because of this general ignorance that so many seem to readily buy into Dan Brown's \\"code behind the code.\\"<br /><br />As I read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" nearly a year ago, I was totally engrossed in the mystery, but as the story progressed, I was increasingly appalled at the \\"history.\\" As an amateur student of Church history, I couldn't help but wish for a single volume I could recommend to help counteract the erroneous views of Christian development that Brown promotes. \\"Breaking the Da Vinci Code\\" is one such volume.<br /><br />While each \\"code\\" could have a scholarly work written about it (and indeed many have been), Bock does a good job of addressing popular misconceptions about Mary Magdalene, whether or not Jesus was married, the Gnostic gospels, the development of the New Testament, and other related issues.<br /><br />It is significant that this book is endorsed by well respected Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox Christian scholars. Personally, as an Orthodox Christian, I found Bock's statements to be, for the most part, thoroughly orthodox (small \\"o\\"), in the sense of C.S. Lewis' \\"Mere Christianity\\" (another book I would also heartily recommend).<br /><br />For further reading, I would strongly urge readers to take a look at \\"Ecclesiastical History\\" (also published as \\"Church History\\"), written by Eusebius in the 4th century. As I stated in my Amazon review of this work, it should be \\"required reading\\" for all thinking Christians.<br /><br />Other Early Church writings should be considered, such as \\"The Apostolic Fathers,\\" edited by Jack Sparks; or any of the volumes in \\"Ante-Nicene Fathers\\" and \\"Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers\\" set of 38 volumes, edited by Philip Schaff; or many of the volumes in the \\"Ancient Christian Writers\\" series from Paulist Press.<br /><br />I listened to the audio recording of \\"Breaking the Da Vinci Code,\\" read by Chris Fabry, as I followed along in the book. While Fabry has a clear, pleasant and convincing voice for this work, I noticed that his mispronunciation of the occasional word slightly shifted the meaning of the author's intent.

But as an adult male who has never experienced the horror exposed in this verse, it is a revealing, and disconcerting, journey into the thoughts and emotions of the little girl who endured it.<br /><br />Earlier this week a female student asked me for any books in our high school library on pedophilia. Those that I placed in her hands were so statistical and objective compared to this one. Next time, I'll be sure to recommend \\"Learning to Swim.\\" It presents the victim's perspective with heart.	2005-02-17

I have always been intimidated by the size of \\"Moby Dick.\\" But recently this great American classic has come up in various conversations and other writings I've encountered, so I decided to listen to the audio book, read by Frank Muller.<br /><br />There is good reason that this book is considered a classic. It gives the reader (or listener) an inside view into the lives of 18th century whalers. It's an epic world travel adventure (by sea, of course). It provides incredible detail into 18th century knowledge of whales and whaling, as well as ships, ship life, etc.<br /><br />On top of this there's a good dose of theology and philosophy. It would not be an overstatement to say that \\"Moby Dick\\" is perhaps the longest commentary on the Book of Jonah ever written.<br /><br />And of course, it's a great tale about the futility of revenge.<br /><br />Frank Muller's reading brings a cast of characters to life. It was a pure joy each day to listen to his characterizations as I drove about in my car.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-01-29

Here we have a renowned modern poet from the late 20th Century, who embraced the Christian faith late in life, interacting with spiritual sources that crossed her path while on her journey of faith.<br /><br />Often one only gets out of a poem what one brings to it, at other times the poem speaks for itself. Both are the case here. Levertov develops a personal dialogue with various texts, personages and paintings, such as Thomas Merton, Julian of Norwich, the Mass for St. Thomas Didymus, Caedmon from Bede's \\"History of the English Church,\\" Velazquez's \\"The Servant Girl at Emmaus,\\" Brother Lawrence's \\"Practice of the Presence of God,\\" \\"Hail, space for the uncontained God\\" (from the Orthodox Christian Akathist hymn), as well as numerous New Testament passages.<br /><br />Some of these poems presuppose at least a nodding acquaintance with the original source. Others, such as those dealing with Christ's suffering on the cross, will be more accessible, since most of our culture still retains an awareness of the life of Christ.<br /><br />While I struggled through some of these works, knowing that if I took the time I could get much more out of them, others demanded to be read a second and third time immediately.<br /><br />Such was the case with \\"Annunciation,\\" which draws on the Gospel account of when the angel Gabriel announces to Mary that she is to bear the Son of God: \\"But we are told of meek obedience. No one mentions/ courage./ The engendering Spirit/did not enter her without consent./ God waited./ She was free/ to accept or to refuse, choice/ integral to humanness.\\"<br /><br />Many still believe that modern poetry and the Christian faith don't mix. Here is proof otherwise. Going through this volume may be like mining for gold for some, but believe me, it's worth the effort. If you like this volume, check out works by Scott Cairns, also found here at Amazon., also found here at Amazon.	2005-01-29

(The number one book on Orthodoxy is his classic work, &quot;The Orthodox Church,&quot; published under his given name, Timothy Ware.<br />I first read an earlier edition of &quot;The Orthodox Way&quot; many years ago as an Evangelical Christian, shortly after I began looking into the Orthodox Church. At that time it communicated to me that something profoundly spiritual was going on in this church of &quot;smells and bells,&quot; robes and formal liturgical worship. It introduced me to the mystery of God, and made me realize that it was important to spend less energy talking about and trying to understand God, and to spend more time getting to know him in prayer. This is where I first encountered the idea that theology in the strict sense of the word is &quot;the contemplation of God himself.&quot;<br />It was this book that explained the importance of the Trinity, not only as part of the Nicene Creed, but that God has been Trinity since before the book of Genesis, and a proper understanding of him will drive how we commune with him. My first reading introduced me to new terms and concepts: apophatic approach (saying what God is not rather than what he is), apatheia (dispassion), passion (any disordered appetite or longing that takes possession of the soul), nous (spiritual intellect), nepsis (watchfulness, sobriety and wakefulness), theosis (deified, or &quot;christified,&quot; or &quot;made sharers of the divine nature&quot; [2 Peter 1:4]), and the difference between the &quot;essence&quot; and &quot;energies&quot; of God.<br />Now, seven years after I began &quot;checking out&quot; the Orthodox Church, and four years after coming home to Orthodoxy, I found myself rereading this volume (revised edition) and discovering how much went right over my head. This time I paid closer attention to the many quotes from liturgical texts, Church Fathers, saints, mystics, monks, historians and theologians. It made me appreciate how much Bishop Kallistos is writing from a rich tradition, that has become my tradition, and how that this Orthodox way, is The Spiritual Way. For fear that this last statement may sound sectarian, it should be noted that this volume has been endorsed by a number leaders and authors outside of the Eastern Orthodox tradition.<br />God wants all to come to know him, and this volume can introduce the reader to a Way that is well mapped out, but sadly, not often traveled.

Part one covers the history of the Church from the beginnings at Pentecost through Byzantium (the Seven Councils and the Great Schism), then the conversion of the Slavs, the Church under Islam, the Russian Church, and on into the twentieth century. Especially sobering is the author's summary of events surrounding the eastern European Orthodox Churches under communism. Coverage of the growth of the Orthodox Church in North America helps explain the current state of things.<br />Part two discusses faith and worship and covers such important topics as: Holy Tradition, God and humankind, the theology and structure of the Church, and detailed explanations of various components of Orthodox worship (including sacraments, feasts, fasts and private prayer). The final chapter, entitled &quot;The Orthodox Church and the Reunion of Christians,&quot; explains various views within the Church concerning the ecumenical movement and the World Council of Churches, and highlights dialogues with various church bodies including Roman Catholics, Old Catholics, Anglicans, and other Eastern Christian bodies such as the Coptic Church and the Armenian Orthodox Church.<br />An extensive, annotated list of further reading, organized by topics, such as &quot;The Early Church and Byzantium,&quot; &quot;Orthodox Theology,&quot; and &quot;Liturgical Worship,&quot; will be extremely helpful for those who wish to dig more deeply into specific areas of interest.<br />While this may indeed be the definitive introductory book on Eastern Orthodoxy, it would certainly be more accessible to readers with some background in the Bible, Church history, or with some experience in liturgical churches.

As a guitar teacher, I have been using earlier editions of Jerry Snyder's &quot;Basic Instructor Guitar&quot; since the 1970s. The thing that impresses me about Jerry Snyder is that he takes a good thing and keeps improving it.<br />Basically, this book is divided into two parts. The front half teaches chords and various strumming and picking techniques (finger picking and/or flat picking) and the back half of the book is devoted to melodic playing (with your choice of flat pick or finger picking).<br />I usually split my lessons between both parts of the book, which is how he intended it to be used (I attended a training session with Snyder many years ago, which is why I know this).<br />Unlike many current guitar technique books, Snyder does not rely exclusivly on guitar tab (basically a diagram of the guitar fingerboard). I agree with his approach that any guitar player worth their salt should learn how to read music. Guitar tab is used in this edition at times to support the note reading, but Snyder does such a good job of introducing musical notation, you hardly need the tab.<br />Throughout the book, Snyder suggests popular tunes (including many oldies) to supplement the material he presents. I find it easy to find similar tunes that fit the individual interests of my students. Over the years Snyder has produced many songbooks that can also be used to supplement these lessons.<br />I recently persuaded a local music store to carry these books, and they have become the book of choice for most of the guitar teachers in the store. For good reason.	2003-10-24

The judge has ordered him to have no more contact with Caitlin, at school or anywhere else. He also has to keep a journal describing his relationship with Cat from the beginning, and he has to attend a domestic violence therapy group. This seems pretty extreme to Nick who admits only to slapping Cat. He still loves her. And wants her back.<br />Alex Flinn has written a believable narrative of teen domestic violence and what goes on in the head of a young man who would hit a girl. The characters in this engaging story are convincing and timeless. I was a teen in the 1960s, and aside from references to beepers and the titles of popular songs, this story could've taken place when I was in high school.<br />While this book is written for teens, the situations would likely ring true for adult men who beat up their wives or girlfriends.<br />While the subject of the book is unpleasant, it's one that certainly needs to be addressed. There is no gratuitous graphic violence here, the sexual situations are suggestive, but not explicit, and the rough language is kept to a minimum. While some readers may not be comfortable with this content, the overall message here is one of hope, which is why I can recommend this title to guys who have hit--or thought about hitting--their women, to women who have been hit, and to people who want to understand this problem better.	2003-10-21

Two additional essays, written in the early 1970s: \\"Worship in a Secular Age,\\" and \\"Sacrament and Symbol,\\" are fitting appendices to the title work, which was originally published as a study guide for a 1963 National Christian Student Federation conference.<br />Schmemann states that we were created to live in a sacramental relationship with God and the creation, but this life was lost in the Fall of Adam and Eve. Christ, who gave his life \\"for the life of the world,\\" came to restore this sacramental relationship, not only with God, but with all of Creation.<br />Schmemann writes that the purpose of the book \\"is to remind its readers that in Christ, life--life in all its totality--was returned to man, given again as sacrament and communion, made Eucharist.\\" He goes on to discuss the importance of this understanding for our mission in the world.<br />I know many individuals who have wondered how the Eastern Orthodox and Christians in the West (both Roman Catholic and Protestant) can use the same terminology and mean different things. Sometimes the differences are subtle, sometimes radical. Schmemann believes that secularism is at the heart of those differences, and that secularism was born when scholars in the West sought to analyze, define and explain the sacraments, most significantly the Eucharist (or Communion).<br />By picking apart the meaning and \\"the elements\\" of Communion, scholasticism allowed the Eucharist to be divorced from the context of the Liturgy. Therefore, in order to satisfy an increasingly scientific approach, the West began to separate the sacred from the secular. As stated above, Christ came to restore the sacramental life as it was intended in the Garden. Schmemann maintains that separating the secular from the sacred is a Christian heresy that needs to be confronted. (By the way, he confronts this tendency among the Orthodox as well.)<br />I would do a disservice to this important work if I were to continue this inadequate description.

Yet, shortly after the Great Schism of 1054 AD, which separated the Church of Rome from the Eastern Patriarchs, persecutions against heretics, and eventually Protestants, became a common tool of the Roman Catholic Church, often resulting in death. Sadly, Protestants did not learn from this abuse of power and often resorted to similar tactics when they came to power in localities throughout Europe.<br />To be fair, persecution by some Russian Orthodox Tzars of non-Orthodox Christians is briefly mentioned. (Overall, the Eastern Orthodox Church has dealt with heretics and dissenters by way of excommunication, not violence, which is why there is virtually no mention of persecution instigated by the Orthodox Church.)<br />Portions of \\"Part Five: Martyrs from the Fifth to the Fifteenth Century,\\" and all of \\"Part Six: Martyrs of the Reformation Era\\" (as well as some later sections) are filled with horrific accounts of violence against Christians by other Christians. One can only weep and mourn over these abuses of those who claim to follow the one who said, \\"Blessed are the peacemakers.\\"<br />Once this volume reaches modern times, we again see attempts to wipe out the Christian faith from without, although now it's at the hands of Liberals (yes, Liberals in France), Communists, Nazis, Muslims and unfriendly native tribes. The final chapter has the martyrdoms listed by country.<br />Some of the names mentioned in this volume are obvious, such as the first deacon and martyr Stephen, the Apostles Peter and Paul (to name just two), Clement of Rome, Ignatius of Antioch, Polycarp, Cyprian, Eusebius, Alban, Martin, Thomas a Becket, Joan of Arc, John Huss, William Tyndale, Thomas More, Thomas Cranmer, Fr. Damien, Jim Elliot, and Maria Skobtsova. A couple of entries that surprised me were individuals who were more likely killed for their political views than for their faith: Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Martin Luther King.<br />This is an extensive anthology, mentioning over 200,000 martyrs (many only by name). However, at times this book is difficult to navigate. Each section (chapter) has its own quasi table of contents, but no page numbers. Each entry does not indicate its source until the end of the entry, making it awkward at times to know who's writing you're reading.<br />There is a helpful index, listing many of the names in the book, but some of the subjects I wanted refer back to were not included.

Rarely have I underlined the text of a book as much as I recently did with &quot;The Mountain of Silence,&quot; by Kyriacos C. Markides.<br />Markides, a sociology professor at the University of Maine, was born on Cyprus into an Eastern Orthodox family, but became secularized while coming of age during the Sixties in the United States. The sociological research for his earliest books brought him into contact with the mystical traditions, shamanism and Occultism of the Orient. A serendipitous experience in 1991 caused him to begin investigating the mystical traditions of the Orthodox Christian faith of his youth, which is covered in his previous book, &quot;Riding with the Lion.&quot;<br />For this book, Markides had intended to spend a sabbatical on Mount Athos, the &quot;Holy Mountain&quot; on a remote peninsula in Greece set aside for over a thousand years as the home to a number of Eastern Orthodox monasteries. Upon learning that his main contact had returned to Cyprus to become the abbot of Panagia Monastery, he changed his plans to spend several months there with Father Maximos and the other monastics under his supervision.<br />While this book is an amazing travelogue, which also contains some engrossing history lessons about Cyprus, monasticism and the Christian faith, it is primarily a series of personal conversations between Professor Markides and Father Maximos. It was the many enlightening comments by the abbot that I found myself voraciously underlining in my copy of the book.<br />While &quot;The Mountain of Silence&quot; has appendices for chapter endnotes and a helpful glossary of Greek terms used throughout the book, it unfortunately does not contain an index.<br />Among the many topics covered in these insightful conversations are: asceticism, addictions, animals, angels, apathia [liberation from egotistical passions], Athonite tradition, the Beatitudes, the Bible, Byzantium, ceaseless prayer, Christ, the Cross, demons, Divine Liturgy, the Ecclesia, equality, faith, fasting, fear of God, freedom, God, grace, the heart, heaven, the Holy Spirit, Hesychast tradition (silence), humility, icons, idolatry, illness (of the soul), illusion, the Jesus Prayer, justice, komboschini (prayer ropes), love, magicians, miracles, monasteries, monks, nationalism, the nous, obedience, passions, Pentecost, perfection, prayer, Providence, radio and television, repentance, repression, saints (living and dead), salvation, sanctification, Satan, sin, spiritual guides/confessors, spiritual struggle, temptations, thoughts (positive and negative), the Threefold way (catharsis or purification of the soul, fotisis or enlightenment of the soul, and theosis or union with God), the Theotokos (Mother of God/Virgin Mary), transfiguration, trials, Turks, Uncreated Light, Western philosophy and theology, and worship.<br />While some readers may be disturbed by some of Professor Markides' sociological and secular questions and comments, it made me feel like I was right there, observing genuine conversations with a modern holy man. Most readers will never have the opportunity to spend hours, much less months, with the renowned abbot of an Orthodox monastery. And many of the questions and comments would be those of anyone raised in the secular (and skeptical) West.<br />This book is highly recommended to anyone desiring to learn more about Orthodox spirituality, monasticism, or even about life on Cyprus and on Mount Athos. Although it's written by a professor, it's not too technical and should be accessible to anyone with a high school education or above.a, equality, faith, fasting, fear of God, freedom, God, grace, the heart, heaven, the Holy Spirit, Hesychast tradition (silence), humility, icons, idolatry, illness (of the soul), illusion, the Jesus Prayer, justice, komboschini (prayer ropes), love, magicians, miracles, monasteries, monks, nationalism, the nous, obedience, passions, Pentecost, perfection, prayer, Providence, radio and television, repentance, repression, saints (living and dead), salvation, sanctification, Satan, sin, spiritual guides/confessors, spiritual struggle, temptations, thoughts (positive and negative), the Threefold way (catharsis or purification of the soul, fotisis or enlightenment of the soul, and theosis or union with God), the Theotokos (Mother of God/Virgin Mary), transfiguration, trials, Turks, Uncreated Light, Western philosophy and theology, and worship. <br />While some readers may be disturbed by some of Professor Markides' sociological and secular questions and comments, it made me feel like I was right there, observing genuine conversations with a modern holy man.

This is an outstanding resource for the musician who wants to play some of Bela Fleck and the Flecktones most requested songs from the following recordings: Flight of the Cosmic Hippo; Bela Fleck and the Flecktones; UFO Tofu; Three Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest; Tales from the Acoustic Planet and Live Art.<br />These transcriptions were painstakingly done by Paul McCandless on the bus while touring with Bela and the band. They're in standard notation with chords. Solos are not transribed. For those musicians who can't read standard notation, there is no tab here.<br />I enjoy playing along with the recordings on my guitar or mandolin, sometimes just following the chord progressions and at other times doubling the melody lines. My favorite tunes include: After the Storm; Bonnie &amp; Slyde; Spunky and Chlorissa; The Sinister Minister; Three Bridges Home and True North.<br />I only wish I could find a transcription of &quot;Lochs of Dread,&quot; which Bela did while with &quot;Strength in Numbers,&quot; and which he revives on &quot;Live Art.&quot;	2003-08-15

It also helps to have at least a passing knowledge of Greek as many of the terms appear in Greek.<br />Lossky spends over half the book laying a foundation on the Eastern understanding of apophaticism (describing God by what He is not), asceticism, the Holy Trinity, uncreated energies of the Godhead, image and likeness, the &quot;economy of the Son&quot; and the &quot;economy of the Holy Spirit,&quot; before discussing the goal of Christian mysticism which is theosis or union with God, the Divine Light. To me, the heart of the book is in the chapter on &quot;The Way of Union,&quot; but it would be meaningless without the preceding chapters.<br />Lossky quotes profusely from the great mystical theologians of the Eastern Church, from various epochs and geographic locations to display the inherent unity of thought on mysticism in the Eastern tradition.<br />Readers who need an introductory work before tackling Lossky might want to try &quot;The Illumined Heart&quot; by Frederica Matthewes-<br />Green, &quot;Beginning to Pray&quot; by Anthony Bloom or &quot;The Art of Prayer&quot; by Igumen Chariton of Valamo.	2003-07-22

I had been curious about &quot;The Cloister Walk&quot; for many years, but have been inexplicably reluctant to read it. Recently I had the opportunity to listen to the abridged audio version of the book, read by actress Debra Winger. Now that I've heard the tape, I'm looking forward to reading the entire book someday.<br />As a convert from Protestantism to the Eastern Orthodox Church, I found that many of Kathleen Norris' thoughts, feelings and experiences in discovering and participating in liturgical life paralleled my own. Her writings remind me of Orthodox writer Frederica Mathewes-Green, notably &quot;Facing East&quot; and &quot;The Illumined Heart,&quot; a well-known convert from the Episcopal Church.<br />I appreciate Norris' penetrating insights into the monastic life. By living with the Benedictines, she was able to answer many of the questions that those of outside of the monastic life have undoubtedly wondered about.<br />I'd recommend this book to anyone curious about liturgical life, monasticism or about going deeper in the Christian walk. While Debra Winger did an adequate job of reading this abridgment, I was unconvinced that she knew what she was reading about. Fortunately Norris' narrative is captivating on its own.	2003-06-09

Alexander Schmemann on Radio Liberty to listeners in the former Soviet Union. Because this single short prayer of Christ has everything that needs to be said about God, his kingdom, this life, about all of us--it is not an exaggeration to suggest that in this commentary Fr. Schmemann provides us with a map for seeing anew the purpose and measure of our whole life. Fr. Schmemann awakens in us a fresh understanding of these familiar petitions.&quot;<br />This short little book, 97 pages, written by one of Eastern Orthodoxy's most respected spokesmen of the 20th century, transcends the distinctiveness of the Orthodox Christian tradition to provide fresh, simple, yet challenging, insights into the prayer that unites Christians of all traditions.<br />This would be an excellent gift book for someone who is just beginning (or even exploring) the Christian journey, or for someone who has been a Christian for a long time and could use a little &quot;refresher course&quot; on the meaning and importance of the Lord's Prayer.<br />The copy I read will soon be a confirmation gift for a Lutheran young man who is dear to my heart.<br />This book is highly recommended.	2003-06-08

There is little for me to add to the fine reviews previously written here about Eusebius' &quot;The History of the Church.&quot; By all means, take the time to read these reviews as they provide excellent tips on how to approach this genuine Christian classic.<br />Although I have been a Church history buff for over 30 years, I had never read Eusebius until recently. Now I would suggest that this volume (whichever translation you prefer) should be required reading for all thinking Christians. However, it would help to have read some other books on early Church history before approaching this one. One of my favorites is &quot;Historical Road of Eastern Orthodoxy,&quot; by Alexander Schmemann.<br />I read Eusebius over a period of several months which caused me to ask various questions of the early Church along the way. Here are some things worth looking for:<br />1. What did the early Church look like? What did they believe and practice and how did they worship?<br />2. What role did heresy (or should I say &quot;fighting heresy?&quot;) play in determining what was orthodox belief and what was not?<br />3. Would I be willing to suffer the same kind of persecution as did these early confessors and martyrs? How can I not be filled with lifelong gratitude for what they endured so that the Christian faith could survive and thrive?<br />4. What was the Church's relationship with the governing authorities? How did this change when Constantine came to power and issued the Edict of Milan (the full text is included in this book) which freed Christians from persecution?<br />5. Does the Church I attend, and the faith I believe, at all resemble what is represented on these pages?<br />By all means, read this book! Perhaps you'll agree that it should be required reading.	2003-05-26

I am referring to the audio version of his &quot;Book of God,&quot; which he reads with animation and liveliness.<br />But it should also be perfectly clear that this is historical fiction, or biblical fiction if you prefer. At times it is even a bit of a commentary on the Bible, but it is not the Bible, nor are some of his characterizations consistent with Christian tradition.<br />Personally, I think Wangerin is at his best with the Old Testament portion of his narrative. Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, David and Jonathan (not to mention Bathsheba), come to life in his telling. Wangerin has obviously done his homework, weaving in accurate images based on archeological findings, and adding vibrant personality and powerful emotions to these familiar stories.<br />In the New Testament portion, there were times when I felt his portrayal of the Apostles or the women, such as Mary Magdalene, were not entirely in keeping with traditional Christian understanding of these heroes of the faith.<br />Having said that, Wangerin has done a great service if he can interest individuals into doing their own research in the Scriptures or in early Church history.<br />With minor reservations, I can still recommend this &quot;Book of God,&quot; especially in audio format.	2003-05-18

One of my favorites is The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work, by John M. Gottman.<br /><br />There is something in the tone of this book that I find irritating. While the advice may be good, the misquoting of Biblical passages is not helpful. The overabundance of simplistic lists does not help flesh out the issues that are brought up. The emphasis on &#34;boundaries,&#34; to the exclusion of love, the thing that brings two people together, is counter intuitive.<br /><br />Also, I listened to the audiobook and found the narrator to be overly dramatic, emphasizing words, like &#34;God,&#34; that sounded artificial. Also whenever he quoted women, he made them all sound like whiney individuals.<br /><br />I'd go elsewhere to find better advice on how to build a strong relationship, such as the title I mentioned above.	2003-05-18

Although Mark Twain uses the story of Adam and Eve in the Book of Genesis as the framework for these &quot;diaries,&quot; the biblical couple and his are two entirely different stories. Having said that, Twain's version is such a touching love story, especially as it is rendered in this recording, it is worth hearing (or reading) without making any comparisons to the first Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.<br />I mention this because a high school student recently inquired with me about Twain's views on religion, and thought that these diaries might shed some light in his beliefs. While I encouraged her to read or listen to Twain's account, simply because of the beauty of the story, I don't think they shed much light on Twain's religious views.<br />I did find it interesting that Twain's Adam and Eve barely mention God at all. Perhaps that is a notable observation on his views of religion after all.<br />Twain's tender observations on the nature of men, women and love is what makes this a moving tale. Walter Cronkite's commentary at the end makes one appreciate the story even more.	2003-03-23

Although I've read a handful of books more than once, &quot;Thirsting for God in a Land of Shallow Wells&quot; is the first book that finished and started right over again!<br />I am a former Evangelical who had raised many questions about the Protestant church, but continued to hang on for lack of an alternative. It wasn't until I heard about the Eastern Orthodox Church at a lecture given by Frank Schaeffer in 1997, that I began investigating this pearl of great price.<br />Gallatin's book appeals to me in that he asked many of the same questions I did, but with his philosophical background, he approached them in greater depth. One friend of mine says that he attacks the rationalism of Protestantism using a rationalistic argument. This may be true, but some of us coming out of this background need to have head questions answered before we can commit our heart. (Once you become Orthodox, you realize this is all backwards.)<br />In the final chapter of this book, Gallatin writes, &quot;I pray that Protestant readers have been challenged to come to grips with the inescapable inconsistencies of their theological heritage. I hope many of their misconceptions regarding the ancient Orthodox Faith have been dispelled. Most of all, I hope I have helped them to see Christianity in the light of its historical truth and its sacramental spirit.&quot;<br />He continues in the next paragraph with, &quot;When it comes to Orthodox readers, my prayer is that this book has nurtured within them a deeper appreciation of their faith. Perhaps they have come to understand it better. Most of all, I hope that they will be able to use the perspectives presented here to help them as they share the truth of their faith in a predominantly Protestant society.&quot;<br />I would agree that he's on target on both counts. I'd recommend this title to both Protestant inquirers and Orthodox &quot;evangelists.&quot;	2003-03-22

I'm sure there are many fine versions available.<br />So, give this tale a listen, and let the language flow into your ears.

Ambrose's \\"Band of Brothers\\" proves that the above saying is no mere cliche.<br />Having been born in Amsterdam in 1950, I grew up hearing firsthand stories of the hellish war from the perspective of an occupied people. I married the daughter of an American G.I. who served in the Pacific during WWII, but it hasn't been until my son began asking him questions a few years ago that we began to hear about his experiences.<br />Ambrose vividly tells the story of Easy Company, from their rigid training in 1942 to their drop on D-Day and their brutal marches and battles to help liberate France, Belgium, and Holland before crossing the Rhine and heading for Hitler's \\"Eagle's Nest.\\"<br />This book is not for the faint of heart. The following quote gives you a brief idea of what I'm talking about. \\"The soldier's concern is with death, not life, with destruction, not construction. The ultimate destruction is killing another human being.\\" Here Ambrose pauses on page 310 to summarize what he spells out in graphic detail on the pages preceding and following.<br />Why was this book written? Ambrose quotes Captain Richard \\"Dick\\" Winters who wrote, \\"...we wondered if the people would ever know what it cost the soldiers in terror, bloodshed, and hideous, agonizing deaths to win the war (page 316).\\" War IS hell, and these guys went through it.<br />I thank Dr. Ambrose for writing this book, and especially for telling the readers what these men did with their lives after the war. Many of us know men (and women) from this generation who haven't talked about what they went through. This book will at least give you a taste of what it was like.<br />I recently talked to a Vietnam War veteran who said that war veterans are often the last ones who want to go to war.

Aside from the simple pleasure of spending time together and discussing films over a big bowl of hot-buttered popcorn, there are teachable moments in these modern parables and character studies. We have a brief window, usually when our children are between the ages of 13 and 18, to watch and discuss mature-minded movies *together*, before they're out on their own.\\"<br />In this helpful introduction, Smithouser states that the pitfalls of a legalistic approach \\"often breeds rebellion\\" and the other extreme, permissiveness \\"inevitably leads to indecent exposure.\\" He goes on to say, \\"the answer lies somewhere in between. That's because teaching discernment inspires critical thinking based on clearly defined boundaries, bonds families, and gives adolescents life skills they'll carry with them into adulthood.\\"<br />He makes clear that Focus on the Family does not necessarily endorse the films suggested in this book. The 25 titles range from G to PG-13 ratings, with the majority of titles made since 1990.

I also saw familiar biblical and theological terms used in similar, yet different, ways.<br />In my puzzlement I wondered, how could I--someone who had read a fair amount of Church history and Christian classics--be in such foreign territory? Was this yet another way of viewing the Christian faith (like the many theological streams I'd encountered in Protestant writings)? Or were these writings espousing not merely different, but erroneous, views of Christianity? Or was there something missing (or even erroneous) in my Western view of the faith that needed clarification?<br />Many of the growing number Eastern Christian books available to Western readers (some of which I have recommended elsewhere here at Amazon), might cause the reader the same kind of puzzlement mentioned above.<br />Along comes this wonderfully simple gem, \\"The Illumined Heart,\\" by renowned author and commentator Frederica Mathewes-Green, who gently invites the reader to explore \\"the ancient Christian path of transformation\\" in an unthreatening manner. Here Frederica introduces us to a fictitious \\"Christian of another era, perhaps from the fifth or sixth century, living in the Middle East,\\" called Anna.<br />By introducing us to Anna, and her family, we catch a glimpse of how Christians of another time and place lived out their faith on a daily basis. While I was a bit leery of how this fictional approach would work, I felt that this woman and her family accurately resembled the historical non-fiction accounts I've read of this era.<br />This is not a \\"religious\\" book in the sense of comparing one tradition or theological viewpoint with another. Instead, the reader begins to see how we in the West have lost contact with our spiritual ancestors, what they believed, and how they lived their daily lives. Here Frederica calls us back to that earlier \\"Christian worldview,\\" and shows how it worked for them and how it could work for us today.<br />Many of the terms and concepts that puzzled me years ago are introduced here within the fabric of Anna's daily life, and consequently, they not only make biblical and theological sense, they become appealing. Fortunately, Frederica provides an excellent bibliography for those who wish to pursue more. I have added as many titles from this bibliography that are currently available at Amazon to a list that you should be able to access here, to make your search for them easier.<br />Frederica also lists some helpful sources on the web, such as the St. Pachomius list of early church documents, and the Christian Classics Ethereal Library.<br />Here's wishing you the best as you explore your own path toward transformation.heir daily lives.

What she said struck a chord with me, an immigrant who came to this country when I was 3 years old from Holland in 1953. I am also very close to a young man who was adopted from Korea when he was 2 years old.<br />While this powerful story is about a Korean girl adapting to her new life in America, many of the struggles she faces are similar to those that I went through, even though I was a white kid from an earlier generation.<br />I plan to share this emotionally gripping story with my adopted Korean friend, as I believe he will find some things to relate to  as well.<br />Don't be put off by the awkward, slow start. That's part of the story's development. Highly recommended.	2002-10-24

Will Hobbs successfully weaves Jason's travels across America and up to the Yukon around real places, people and events. Although Seattle plays a minor role in this story, it illustrates how the city actually served as a \\"jumping off\\" place for those rushing to the Klondike Gold Rush of 1897.<br />\\"Jason's Gold\\" is in the same tradition as fine adventure stories such as \\"Hatchet,\\" \\"My Side of the Mountain,\\" and--of course--Jack London's \\"White Fang\\" and \\"The Call of the Wild.\\" After reading \\"Jason's Gold,\\" you might enjoy reading the famous--and humorous--Klondike poem, \\"The Cremation of Sam McGee,\\" by Robert Service.	2002-05-30

In this case Baumann is suspected of being a spy, perhaps a member of the CIA, and he has a hard time convincing the border guards, his captors and the judges otherwise. Altogether he spends nine months in an infamous high-security prison in Tehran. He is ultimately released and rushed out of the country thanks to his dual citizenship with Switzerland.<br />While this was an interesting, and at times inspiring, book, my wife and I found the pace dreadfully slow, largely due to the fact that the author provides much more detail than is necessary. And while the treatment Baumann received in prison should not have to be endured by any human being, I felt that his suffering was minor compared to that of other martyrs and confessors for Christ that I have read about.<br />Other books in this genre that I would recommend more highly include: \\"The Hiding Place,\\" by Corrie ten Boom, about her sufferings as a Dutch Christian during World War II, or \\"Father Arseny,\\" about a Russian Orthodox priest who spent more than 20 years in Stalin's gulag.<br />Dan Baumann's book also left me with many unanswered questions, mainly, why did he really go to Iran? What did he do there? What did he accomplish? How did he go about it?	2002-05-29

The more I got to know Willa Jo and Little Sister, as well as Aunt Patty, Uncle Hob and Mom, the more my questions yearned for answers.<br />This story, about a summer filled with grief and the different ways of trying to cope with it, is hauntingly spiritual. Despite the well-meaning efforts of Aunty Patty and her churchgoing neighbors, the spiritual depths are mined by a grieving mother who paints pictures of angels, and by two lonely girls sitting on the roof watching the sun rise.<br />I'm not sure how many middle-grade readers will be drawn into this sparse story, but it would be worth the effort, especially for those dealing with grief or the departure of a parent.	2002-04-09

This Scott O'Dell Award winner about African-American life in the South is in the same tradition as the renowned \\"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry\\" books by Mildred Taylor.<br />Here we get on an emotional roller-coaster ride as we follow the lives of three young ex-slaves during the early days of Reconstruction in 1865. Gideon returns from following General Sherman to his former plantation to retrieve his younger crippled brother, Pascal, and his orphaned friend Nelly. In their quest to find the \\"forty acres and maybe a mule\\" in Georgia, that had been promised by General Sherman, they befriend a grandfatherly carpenter, and his long-lost granddaughter, to create a new family.<br />The harsh realities of unjust treatment by white nightriders, who are trying to force emancipated slaves to return to their plantations, are tempered by various friendly white people who help them find their forty acres, open a school for the children, register them to vote, who become neighbors, etc.<br />This is a story of determination, hard work, rebuilding lives and families, of hope, peace, and love, in the face of discrimination and cruelty.<br />A seldom recognized historical fact is woven into this well-researched tale: the party of Lincoln, the Republican Party, was the original party of Civil Rights. The impact of the death of Lincoln on these emancipated slaves that were given land is dramatically portrayed here. And the quick backpedaling of his successor, Andrew Johnson, becomes a painful reality for nearly 39,000 black landowners just months after he takes office.<br />This book deserves a wider reading by upper elementary through middle school students and their teachers, especially when discussing the facts surrounding the impact of the Civil War and early Reconstruction efforts in the South.	2002-03-16

Bancroft's account, with insertions from other diaries, gives us a glimpse not only of the journey, which is fascinating, but of the political squabbles among the leaders. Among other things, we learn about White's infamous order to kill all the dogs in the party. The group reaches the Whitman Mission, near Walla Walla, and most continue on to Fort Vancouver.<br />The shortest account, but the one that interested me the most, is \\"Through Naches Pass,\\" by James Longmire. It tells of the 1853 Longmire party, giving a brief account of their travels to Fort Walla Walla, but providing more detail on their struggles to be the first wagon train to arrive in the Puget Sound area, crossing the Cascade Mountains just north of Mount Rainier. This was the first party to arrive in the West with most of their wagons. Here we see a tired, ragged party on the western slopes of the Cascades celebrating by clubbing and eating their fill of humpback salmon, although Mrs. Longmire preferred to buy a pheasant from a nearby Indian hunter.<br />I'd recommend these first-hand accounts of the overland journey to the West to anyone interested in the westward movement, as well as to teachers and students studying this period of history.	2002-03-09

Instead, I found myself puzzled that a book without quotation marks, and very few punctuation marks, would be the winner of the Newbery Honor Medal. These became hurdles for me to stumble on in order to win me over.<br />However, in the end, I became accustomed to the unconventional punctuation, and \\"May Amelia\\" did win me over. I still think its unfortunate that a publisher would make a very exciting and realistic piece of historical fiction difficult for middle readers to access, especially when they will also have to struggle with some unusual Finnish names.<br />I came away from \\"Our Only May Amelia\\" feeling like I'd encountered a piece of Washington (and Oregon) state history that I never knew about, notably the community of \\"Little Finland\\" on the Nasel (now spelled \\"Naselle\\") River, near where the Columbia River and the Pacific Ocean meet. The descriptions of life on a homestead are true to the firsthand stories I heard from my wife's German grandmother whose family homesteaded in the same region during the same era.<br />Since I recently vacationed in Astoria, Oregon, I found the description of this hilly maritime community (the oldest settlement west of the Mississippi) physically accurate and true to the facts about fishing, canneries, maritime activities and immigrant peoples (including Chinese cannery workers) that are beautifully presented at the local Maritime Museum.<br />The experiences of May Amelia are realistic and accurately reflect the hardships of living in a rugged Pacific Northwest logging and fishing community at the turn of the last century. I would warn the sensitive reader that there are some rough edges to this story, including a couple of profanities and several deaths.	2002-03-09

However, as a person of faith, I would add that the scope of this book is limited to earthly life and therefore does not touch on the belief in life after death.<br />The text states: \\"Nothing that is alive goes on living for ever.\\" This statement either reflects the authors' intent on only dealing with the concept of physical death, or it could be interpreted as their belief statement. This is why I'd suggest that \\"Lifetimes\\" be read by, or shared with, a caring adult who would be able to answer a child's questions based on a family's belief system.	2002-03-09

What we have here is an appealing piece of historical fiction, written at about a 5th grade level, which will appeal to middle readers who are interested in horses, stories about tomboys, history of the US in the mid-1800s, notably New England and California, and the early days of the women's suffrage movement.<br />A brief epilogue tells about the real Charlotte Darkey Parkhurst.	2002-03-02

A couple of weeks ago I read \\"Frindle,\\" by Andrew Clements, and decided it was one of the best kids' books I'd read in a long time. As a result, I decided to read \\"The Landry News,\\" and my reaction is just as positive. I'm an elementary school librarian, and I can tell you I'll be ordering several more copies of these books--as well as other titles by Clements--for our library.<br />Clements has a way of writing a deceptively simple story--with many interweaving layers--that make his tales appealing to both children and adults. As in \\"Frindle,\\" where a fifth-grade boy invents a new word, Clements takes a small, seemingly insignificant event, in this case the creation of a single newspaper posted on the wall by a new girl in class, to set in motion a growing chain of events that gets bigger and bigger. It's almost as if Andrew Clements is saying that there is no such thing as an insignificant event. As John Donne wrote, \\"No man is an island.\\"<br />Some of the seemingly small things that moves the plot along in this engaging story are: not one, but two divorces; the newspaper on the wall; a burned-out teacher reading newspapers and drinking coffee; a mother reading a couple of verses from the Book of Psalms to her daughter; apologies; a helpful librarian; a \\"concerned\\" principal; an inquisitive small town newspaper reporter; new friends; the Bill of Rights and; \\"truth and mercy.\\"<br />If these two first books are any indication, Andrew Clements is an author worth paying attention to. His stories have \\"heart.\\"<br />This book, written at a 6th grade level, would make an excellent read-aloud for upper elementary classes. Having said that, I think this story is inspiring enough to be read to any class--even up through high school--that is involved in journalism or some kind of \\"newspapers in education\\" curriculum. This is one of those stories that has staying power and is filled with wisdom. Highly recommended!	2002-03-01

I only regret that I didn't read it years ago, so I could've been recommending it to teachers to read-aloud and to students who would like a humorous, yet thought-provoking, story.<br />Like most successful books for kids, \\"Frindle\\" works on many different levels. It's funny, fast-paced, and while the main character, Nick, is kind of a class clown, he has qualities that even a mean teacher like Mrs. Granger would like. And even though Mrs. Granger has a reputation for being strict, she also earns the respect of children and parents. While some situations are a bit far-fetched, this story is still quite realistic. We get a glimpse how a seemingly insignificant event at a small town elementary school through a media-frenzy becomes an international phenomenon. Can anyone say \\"fad?\\"<br />3rd through 6th grade teachers should consider reading this book about the invention of a new word, \\"frindle,\\" to their classes. Both teachers and students will enjoy it.	2002-02-17

We just added \\"Westward to Home\\" and several other \\"My America\\" books to our elementary school library, so it remains to be seen how popular this particular title will be.<br />Author Patricia Hermes does a fine job of telling the story of a nine-year old boy, through brief journal entries, about life on the Oregon Trail in 1848. While we get a kid's eye view of the hardships, the people, and some of the typical events associated with traveling west by covered wagon, I'm not convinced that this is a genuinely BOY'S book.<br />I have traveled along the Oregon Trail, from Independence, MO, to Walla Walla, WA, and I was once a boy. That makes me no expert, but I think a nine-year old kid on the Oregon Trail would be less interested in the interpersonal difficulties of the adults in the wagon train, and more fascinated with guns, never-before-seen animals such as pronghorns, prairie dogs, snakes, lizards, and buffalo, and some of the amazing landforms that come into view after a monotonous trek across the flat prairies.<br />There was a brief mention of Chimney Rock, which would be awe inspiring for any kid to see and muse about. And what about Register Rock where a kid would surely stop to scratch in his own name and read the signatures of those who had gone on before? One would think a boy would be more amazed at his first views of the Rockies. And even when Joshua is curious about the Indians he sees in the forts along the way, I'd expect him to be more fascinated with the way they looked and talked, what they wore, how they smelled and how they did things like eat and smoke. This could also be said for the soldiers and trappers he must've seen at these forts.<br />I also can't imagine a nine-year old boy spending so much time in his journal worrying about a girl who was \\"sweet\\" on him. Instead, I would like to have seen his male friendships developed a bit more fully.<br />Having said all this, I still think this book is a welcome addition to middle grade titles about the Oregon Trail. The overall picture of the life, people and hardships, including many tragic deaths, is realistic. I anticipate that more girls will be reading this than boys, but it fills a need at this level.ut the Oregon Trail.

Now, we're planning to have this hilarious story read to all of our upper grade classes just before \\"THE TEST.\\"<br />There's not much to add to the other favorable reviews already posted here, other than to say that \\"Testing Miss Malarkey\\" might help to relieve test anxiety for students just prior to testing. As with all good children's books, there's humor, or a message, for both kids and adults. \\"Miss Malarkey\\" does this quite nicely.<br />Personally, I got some chuckles out of the staff members' names. The cafeteria lady is Mrs. Slopdown, the art teacher is Mrs. Magenta, the PE teacher is Mr. Fittanuff, and the janitor is Mr. Surley.<br />I look forward to adding this title to our elementary school library and to seeing it be enjoyed for many years to come.	2002-02-12

I just read it to a group of first graders in our elementary school library, and they were completely engrossed in this tale.<br />Teddy Bear falls asleep dreaming about being a wild bear and wakes up to an ever changing adventure where he meets grizzlies, kangaroos, a koala, a sloth bear, a panda, a spectacled bear, and polar bears, before waking up on the bedroom floor at home.<br />Janet Slingsby effectively takes children through a rapid array of animal facts (mostly about bears, of course), while dispelling common myths about koalas and pandas being bears. She concludes this story about \\"running away\\" with the obvious, and comforting, conclusion that there's no place like home.<br />Tony Morris' bright water-colors support the text with a realistic, yet dreamy, quality.<br />I would recommend this to primary teachers when they are discussing the difference of animals, especially bears.	2002-02-09

The scratchboard illustrations, although unusual for this format, create a vibrancy that enhances the text.<br />This narrative revolves around the statement: \\"The Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., is famous because he helped our country change some of its laws.\\" Then in simple language it goes on to explain some of the laws he helped change.<br />It goes on to say, \\"Poor people, rich people, white people, black people, and people from all around the world listened when Martin Luther King spoke.\\" Of course, there is mention of his 1963 speech in Washington, D.C., where his \\"dream was that people everywhere would learn to live together without being mean to one another.\\"<br />This is an excellent book to read aloud to younger students, although as a school librarian, I have seen it used effectively up to the 5th grade (like another reviewer here).

Having said that, Fr. Mack has been able to shed light on each of the 30 steps of the ladder and make them relevant for the non-monastic reader.<br />Accompanying Amazon's book description, you have the opportunity to view the table of contents, which gives you Fr. Mack's contemporary names for each of the steps. You can also read the first chapter, which will give you an idea of the content and structure of his writing.<br />Hopefully one reading of this volume will whet your appetite for tackling the entire Ladder of Divine Ascent, which is filled with pearls of wisdom. Amazon.com lists various translations of \\"The Ladder,\\" however I'm only familiar with one from \\"The Classics of Western Spirituality,\\" which contains an informative introduction by Bishop Kallistos Ware. This is the one that was used for discussion in our Orthodox church men's group.<br />Just as most Orthodox monastic communities read one step of The Ladder on each weekday during Great Lent, I'm hoping to reread (and read aloud to my family) Fr.

When asking any experts to recommend books on Eastern Orthodox Church music, this scholarly volume by Johann von Gardner will invariably be among the first titles mentioned. This English translation, done by Vladimir Morosan, was published by St. Vladimir's Seminary Press in 1980.<br />The author states at the outset of his preface: &quot;The present work is intended as an aid to those who feel the necessity of gaining deeper understanding of the liturgical singing of the Russian Orthodox Church, not only in its present-day practical forms, but also in its theoretical essence and thousand year history.&quot;<br />While von Gardner accomplishes his goal with clarity and scholarly precision, it serves and an excellent introduction to the music of all Eastern Orthodox Churches, including the Greek, and the Arab-based Antiochian Orthodox Church (of which I am a relatively new member). In discussing the establishment of Orthodox Christianity on American and Western European soil the translator states in his preface, &quot;...the parishes established by the Church of Russia have naturally preserved the choral tradition of the Mother-Church, and even parishes from Greek or Syrian traditions of monodic chant have in some instances adopted Russian choral singing under the influence of the prevailing choral milieu of the West.&quot;<br />It cannot be stressed enough, as is stated on the back-cover summary, &quot;the music of the Orthodox Church cannot be understood in purely aesthetic categories, apart from the liturgical context which determines both its content and its function.&quot; That's really what this book is all about, how the music and liturgy are inseparable.<br />Although I have many years of experience directing choirs and leading worship services in Protestant Churches, I discovered that as I began tackling the job of directing our Orthodox parish choir (on a part-time basis), that it was like learning a new language. This book goes a long way toward helping the reader become familiar with that new language, but one can only learn to &quot;speak it&quot; by full immersion in the services of the Orthodox Church.<br />Below are the titles for each of the four chapters:<br />The System of Orthodox Liturgical Singing: Concepts and Terminology<br />The Liturgical System of the Orthodox Church<br />The System of Russian Liturgical Singing<br />Periodization of Russian Liturgical Singing<br />I would definitely agree with those who recommended this book to me, it is an excellent introduction, however if you have no first-hand experience with Orthodox liturgies, I would think that much of this book would be an academic exercise.<br />At times, the reader may feel overwhelmed with too much information, or with unfamiliar terminology, but for someone like me who wants to get to the heart of this glorious worship experience, it's worth the effort.e reader become familiar with that new language, but one can only learn to &quot;speak it&quot; by full immersion in the services of the Orthodox Church.<br />Below are the titles for each of the four chapters:<BR>The System of Orthodox Liturgical Singing: Concepts and Terminology<BR>The Liturgical System of the Orthodox Church<BR>The System of Russian Liturgical Singing<BR>Periodization of Russian Liturgical Singing<br />I would definitely agree with those who recommended this book to me, it is an excellent introduction, however if you have no first-hand experience with Orthodox liturgies, I would think that much of this book would be an academic exercise.<br />At times, the reader may feel overwhelmed with too much information, or with unfamiliar terminology, but for someone like me who wants to get to the heart of this glorious worship experience, it's worth the effort.	2002-01-08

It's always been part of our Advent tradition, and works very nicely as a weekly Advent calendar (in conjunction with Advent candles, if you wish).<br />The first page features the Annunciation.<br />The second shows Joseph taking Mary into Bethlehem.<br />On the third we see the innkeeper showing them the stable.<br />Then a glorious angel appears to the shepherds, followed by the three wise men following a bright (expanding) star and finally the shepherds and wise men coming to the stable to see Mary, Joseph and the baby Jesus.<br />This year we read this visually appealing book to our now grown-up children on Christmas Eve, still to the delight of all.	2001-12-26

Students in our predominantly Gentile elementary school enjoy listening to this heartwarming tale of a poor Eastern European Jewish family near the city of Minsk celebrating Hanukkah during a winter blizzard. Their potatoes and apples are hidden beneath the freezing snow before they have a chance to make latkes and applesauce for their celebration. Despite their hunger, they take in a stray kitten and dog, who are able to locate potatoes and apples on the eighth night of Hanukkah after the skies clear.<br />Since our students know so little about Jewish family life, this tender story gives them a glimpse into a loving family and the way they celebrate the holidays during this particular harsh winter.<br />The book concludes with a brief description of Hanukkah and a recipe for making latkes (which is delicious, since I made them the first year we got this book for our school library).	2001-12-19

The quasi-biblical language used in the text makes this book more effective for older students, from about 4th to 6th grades.<br />Students familiar with the Bible and the Temple in Jerusalem seem to get a bit more out of the narrative, but it's still necessary to stop and explain terms like Sabbath, idols, pigs, and the month of Kislev.<br />Ori Sherman's bold colorful paintings are obviously not meant to depict a literal representation of the story line, and the students readily accept them as an artistic interpretation.<br />In our rural, mostly Gentile, environment, this version of the Story of Hanukkah has been a helpful resource.	2001-12-19

This is one where the illustrations get, and deserve, equal standing with the animated and atmospheric storyline.<br />In our predominantly Gentile elementary school, it helps to explain dreidels, latkes, and the lighting of the menorah candles for eight nights before commencing. But then the fun begins. This Hershel falls into the tradition of great trickster tales where he uses his quick wit and careful planning to outsmart the goblins (as well as THE KING OF THE GOBLINS) so that he can light the Hanukkah candles each night.<br />This book is a complete delight, and a humorous way to introduce the festival of Hanukkah to our many Gentile students. Like another reviewer here, I have a great deal of fun using various voices to bring this tale to life.	2001-12-19

He turned around and parted his hair. &quot;Do you see another face back there?&quot;<br />Mr. Morrison is the flimflam man in this story, and he has conned two vulnerable girls, former foes who gradually become friends, into helping him promote a circus that is supposedly coming to town.<br />This story, a chapter book written at about the third grade level, appeals to students all the way up to 6th grade in our school. It has a genuine feel for small town Wetumka, Oklahoma, in 1950, which is where this historical fiction story (based on actual events) takes place. Darleen Bailey Beard makes the plot and characters work on at least two levels: first, it serves as a warning that not everyone can be trusted, and secondly, it's a heartwarming tale about a friendship that develops out of adversity.<br />The lessons taught in this short (85 page) book are those that children need to hear. Recommended.	2001-12-17

It's illustrated throughout with black and white photos and illustrations, including classic images of Santa Claus, Sinterklaas (the Dutch version of Saint Nicholas), and images from stained-glass windows and religious art.<br />As an elementary school librarian, I've traditionally read the introductory chapters of this informative volume to sixth grade classes each year in the weeks preceding Christmas. Many students are amazed to learn that the fairy tale of Santa Claus is based on a tradition that goes back to a real person, who was a priest and bishop in the early Christian church. They love to hear the story about when young Nicholas secretly provided the dowries for three young women who were about to be sold into slavery by their poor father. Students immediately see the connection between this story and the Santa they are more familiar with.<br />I've always viewed this as a lesson in history, and as a way to replace the myth many of them have held with information on a person who really lived.<br />The book continues to discuss the origins of many Santa Claus traditions. Things are presented in a factual manner, and while religion is mentioned, it is not a religious book. It appears that this book is now out of print, which is unfortunate. Hopefully it can be updated and republished with color illustrations. There is another book with the same title listed here, which appears to cover some of the same territory, but in a picture-book format.<br />Another interesting book worth investigating is \\"The Saint Nicholas Secret,\\" by Dennis E. Engleman, which discusses the author's rediscovery of the real Saint Nicholas as an adult.	2001-12-12

Sanderson's paintings are reminiscent of traditional Eastern Orthodox icons and Roman Catholic religious art. Both the illustrations and the text on each page facing them are bordered with vines, flowers, leaves, and birds, in the style of illumined text.<br />This would make a nice gift for a child at Christmas, and its size might allow it to be a stocking stuffer.	2001-12-12

Sit down and I'll tell you all the story of the first Christmas.&quot;<br />&quot;Santa's Favorite Story&quot; is an attractively illustrated (with watercolors) picture book for children, which helps to de-emphasize Santa's role in Christmas, and helps to place the focus where it should belong. I'm sure the real Saint Nicholas would agree that it's part of his favorite story as well! (For more on the real St. Nicholas, take a look at &quot;The Saint Nicholas Secret,&quot; by Dennis E.

Instead, what we have here is a recognized historian writing a kid-friendly book explaining some of the historical context of the Nativity story by having a mother answer her inquisitive child's many questions.<br />As Christopher's mom reads from gospel of St. Luke, chapter 2, she responds to her eight-year old son's questions about Caesar Augustus, registering for the census, why Joseph was not the father of Jesus Christ, why God chose Mary to be Jesus' mother, how old she might have been, where she lived, the lineage of King David, why Christmas is celebrated on December 25, what the stable was like, why there wasn't any room at the inn, why the shepherds were terrified at the sight of the angel, and how St. Luke knew &quot;all this stuff.&quot;<br />This book is highly recommended to Christians of all traditions, as well as to non-Christian families who may be curious about what's really behind the Christmas story. As the author states in his brief introduction, many &quot;children's Christmas books are often long on fancy and short on fact.&quot; I would agree when he says, &quot;these pages...return the Christmas focus to where it belongs.&quot; The gospel story is no fairy tale, and here Paul L. Maier places it within the context of history, so children like Chris in this story can learn &quot;about real people and real things that really happened.&quot;	2001-12-08

Williams, explains the development of Christian worship, starting with the Early Church and its roots in Scripture and the Jewish traditions of temple and synagogue worship.<br />In Part II: Harold B. Anstall takes the reader on \\"A Journey Through the Liturgy.\\" Here he starts with \\"The Interior of an Orthodox Church,\\" which is appropriate, since that is usually the first thing someone experiences upon attending any service in the Orthodox Church. The rest of this section goes through a step-by-step explanation of everything that is said and done in a Divine Liturgy, the \\"main event\\" of Orthodox Christian worship.<br />In the conclusion: \\"A Call to Worship,\\" Williams invites the Western reader to visit, understand and experience liturgical worship as practiced in the Orthodox Church. Here he gives a quick, understandable overview of how Christianity in the West has departed, and continues to travel farther, from its historical roots in liturgical worship.<br />I first read \\"Orthodox Worship,\\" after attending a series of lectures by Frank Schaeffer (son of the late Evangelical apologist and theologian, Francis Schaeffer) in 1997. At that point I was firmly entrenched in an Evangelical church as a praise band director and worship leader. Schaeffer explained his departure from Evangelicalism and his \\"coming home\\" to the Orthodox Church. (For more about that, see his book \\"Dancing Alone.\\") I began visiting a couple of Orthodox churches in our area, and decided I wanted to understand what was going on.<br />After my first reading of \\"Orthodox Worship,\\" I concluded that:<br />1. Liturgical worship does indeed have its roots in Scripture and in the practices of the Early Church, as practiced in the book of Acts.<br />2. There is a reason for everything that is said and done in the Divine Liturgy, and that it is all based on Scripture and the development of the Christian faith in the first three centuries.<br />Now, several years later, as I approach the second anniversary of my own \\"coming home\\" to the Orthodox Church, I decided to reread this volume. Now that I've gradually let liturgical worship become an integral part of my life, and now that I sing in (and sometimes direct) our parish choir, I found completely different quotes jumping off the page than the ones I highlighted the first time through, such as:<br />\\"It is worth noting...that the frequently quoted passage...\\"where two or three are gathered in My name, I am there in the midst of them\\" is not a stand-alone proposition. It has a very specific context, and that context is The Church! (page 80).\\"<br />I'd recommend this fine introductory volume to people who want to investigate the roots of liturgical Christian worship, to those who are inquiring about the Eastern Orthodox Church, as well as to those Orthodox Christians who need a refresher course on the Divine Liturgy. The only drawback of the edition I read was the many typographical errors scattered throughout the book, which was a little distracting.<br />(...)and the development of the Christian faith in the first three centuries.<br />Now, several years later, as I approach the second anniversary of my own \\"coming home\\" to the Orthodox Church, I decided to reread this volume.

My wife, like Patricia Polacco, attended school in an era when this learning disability didn't have a name. She was like Tricia when the caring Mr. Falker said, &quot;But, little one, don't you understand, you don't see letters or numbers the way other people do. And you've gotten through school all this time, and fooled many, many good teachers!&quot; My wife finally made sense of all those &quot;wiggling shapes&quot; on the page in the 6th grade, and she hasn't stopped reading since.<br />This is just to say this is a TRUE STORY for many children. And it's told (and illustrated) in a manner that will enable other children understand and empathize with the struggles, the feelings of loneliness and rejection, and the ultimate joy of victory (not to mention the warmth and security of loving grandparents)!<br />I have read &quot;Thank You, Mr. Falker&quot; to many first and second grade classes in our elementary school library, and in every case you could hear a pin drop by the time we got to the third page! This book should be required reading for every teacher, and should be a staple in every elementary school library. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	2001-10-25

They told me I'd love it and they were right!<br />This is a charming story about a mouse who discovers he can sing, in the process saving his sibling mice from the cat in the house and becoming the companion of elderly Mrs. Honeybee who teaches Wolf new songs on her piano.<br />It's a simple and appealing story line, but I applaud Dick King-Smith for tackling two subjects not usually found in children's literature. On the one hand he skillfully interweaves musical terms and concepts, and on the other hand he paints a sympathetic portrait of the life of an elderly widow living alone.<br />This delightful tale should be welcome in the home of musical families or where children need a glimpse into the life of a lonely senior citizen. The adult readers of this story will have many private chuckles over the tunes Mrs. Honeybee chooses to teach her singing mouse: everything from the Beatles' &quot;Help!&quot; to showtunes such as &quot;Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'.&quot;	2001-10-16

I am an elementary school librarian who reads &quot;The Berenstain Bears Go To School&quot; each September to our new kindergartners. It helps set their minds at ease about what school is like.<br />In this Berenstain Bears story, Mama Bear notices that Sister Bear looks worried when Brother Bear mentions that he wants to get back to school after summer vacation. Mama Bear takes Sister to the Bear Country School to meet Miss Honeybear, the kindergarten teacher. A few days later, Brother Bear rushes to the bus, dragging Sister along with him. Sister discovers that she loves school, so a few days later when Brother Bear wishes it was still vacation, Sister is the one who drags *him* to the bus.<br />My students always laugh at this change of perspective. I find most of the Berenstain Bear books to be an ideal, and entertaining, way to teach children positive behaviors or attitudes, or to help them relate about the real world.

Each state/province is subdivided into metropolitan areas and geographical regions. Then each area or town has listings for places to stay, places to eat and things to see and do. While this volume is *not* exhaustive in terms of EVERYTHING you could see or do, it certainly covers the highlights of things you would enjoy seeing and doing with your children. We recently planned a trip to Oregon with a teenager using this guide as one of many resources. We were not disappointed, and as a matter of fact, we weren't able to cover everything suggested in this book in the time we had available. I would suggest that these guides for going places with children work just as well for adults who want to glean the highlights of locations they'll be visiting in the Pacific Northwest. Since we were traveling with a tent trailer, we did not make use of the &quot;places to stay&quot; feature, however in glancing through them, some seem to be a bit on the pricey side. Also, we discovered a great hamburger restaurant in Bend, Oregon (called &quot;Pilot Butte&quot;) that was not listed in this guide. So, like I said, &quot;Going Places&quot; is not exhaustive, but it certainly is helpful.	2001-08-25

By comparison, Joseph's nomadic sheepherding father, Jacob, and Joseph's treacherous brothers live rather humble lives in the desert.<br />Unfortunately, the text of this version of the emotionally compelling biblical account is rather dry and matter-of-fact.

Each hike is rated by type of hike (day hike or backpack), difficulty, distance, terrain, high point, when it is hikable and contact information. The narrative gives a clear description of the hike, its popularity, what you'll see and how to get there. There is an explanation of the symbols used in the book, and the introduction discusses why you should hike with children, how to use the book, what to take, safety issues, good trail manners and trailhead fees.<br />So, whether you're a parent looking for some fun hikes for the children, or you're an adult looking to stretch your legs in the Oregon outdoors, this is an excellent guide to help you plan your outing.	2001-08-15

We used several guides in planning a recent trip to south and central Oregon, with a stop at Mt. St. Helens on the way home, and this one was by far the most informative! Before we went to a particular destination, I would tell my family, &quot;First you have to listen to this!&quot; Then I would read Lonely Planet's description and historical/geological background of the site we were about to visit. I think we all enjoyed our trip much more because of this &quot;anticipatory set.&quot;<br />Highly recommended, not only for first-time visitors to a region, but for natives to learn more about the beauty and history right in their own backyard.	2001-08-15

Like another reviewer here, I agree it would be nice to have a rating system and more complete descriptions of the amenities of each site, but then this 837 page tome would become too big to take along.<br />Since we were traveling at the peak season, we opted to camp at Collier State Park, about 30 miles from Crater Lake, our intended destination. While Collier was a nice, quiet place to stay, we could've camped closer to, or even within, Crater Lake Nation Park. Some of Stienstra's comments led me to make this decision.<br />At another point, we wanted to camp near Bend, but ended up at Prineville Reservoir State Park, about 30 miles east of Bend. The state parks near Bend were booked solid, and we wanted to be assured of some good fishing for our son. He caught a small-mouthed bass at Prineville, which made him happy. My wife and I were too hot, but I guess a book can't really give you a weather report.<br />And, near Mount St. Helens, we stayed at Mount St. Helens RV Park, which the book described as &quot;cozy&quot; and &quot;secluded.&quot; But the book didn't say anything about the fact that if you get there after the office closes, you're not given a key to the locked bathroom. Fortunately, a neighboring camper loaned us his.<br />So, it sounds like I'm complaining about this book, which is not my intent. It's quite thorough, but can't account for changes in conditions such as popularity of a given site, weather, or new ownership. So, use this guide with flexibility, and with a few other guides nearby that contain better descriptions of the areas you're planning to visit, such as &quot;Going Places: Family Getaways in the Pacific Northwest,&quot; by Ann Bergman, et al, or &quot;Best Hikes With Children in Western &amp; Central Oregon,&quot; by Bonnie Henderson, or &quot;Pacific Northwest: Oregon and Washington,&quot; by Bill McRae, et al.ntral Oregon,&quot; by Bonnie Henderson, or &quot;Pacific Northwest: Oregon and Washington,&quot; by Bill McRae, et al.	2001-08-15

Since our 5th grade social studies curriculum covers the settlement and colonial period of American history, this story about Matt's family homesteading in woods of Maine during this period fits in perfectly.<br />While &quot;The Sign of the Beaver&quot; is an outstanding piece of historical fiction, it is also an exciting adventure story in the tradition of books like &quot;My Side of the Mountain,&quot; &quot;Hatchet,&quot; and &quot;Island of the Blue Dolphins.&quot;<br />It's been many years since I first read &quot;The Sign of the Beaver,&quot; so I decided to listen to the audio-book on 2 cassettes, read by actor Greg Schaffert. Schaffert does a great job of moving this adventure along at a swift pace, and bringing the main characters to life. As one young reviewer wrote here, this story makes a great read-aloud, and listening to the tapes would be an excellent option for students, or for teachers to play for an entire class.<br />Through Matt's friendship with Attean and his grandfather, chief of the Beaver clan, he learns to survive while his father goes to retrieve his mother and sister to bring them back to the cabin they built. Matt agrees to teach Attean how to read after they save him from life-threatening bee stings. In the end, Matt learns more from his native friend, than Attean does from him.<br />While it is true that white people unfairly took land from the Indians, and this is a story that needs to be told, there were some subliminal messages I didn't notice the first time I read this book. Although Matt has two books in his cabin, &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; and the Bible, he mainly sees the Bible as a bunch of exciting stories, and not as a source for his religion. So, while the Bible is not connected to any sense of spirituality, much is said about the ceremonial life of Attean's tribe, and more specifically about his spirit quest for his manitou. So this book implies that Native American ways and spirituality are superior to the white man's ways and religion.<br />This is just a small observation, in an otherwise excellent book. It's an exciting historical fiction adventure that students are bound to enjoy. It would work both within the context of studying early American history, or as part of a study on Native American life. As another student reviewer wrote here, this book leaves many unanswered questions, so it's an excellent springboard to learning more about Indians in the past.pirituality, much is said about the ceremonial life of Attean's tribe, and more specifically about his spirit quest for his manitou.

My teenaged son--who normallly loves to listen to books on tape--was so annoyed by this, he quit listening within the first few chapters.<br />However, just as the font in the book gets smaller and the language gets smoother, McHall's version of Mila's voice becomes easier to listen to as Mila ajdusts to being removed from her dolphin family and living with scientists who teach her English and music, while they study her in hopes of learning dolphin language.<br />Both the book and the audio-book have an atmosphere that grows on you, and it's easy to get caught up in Mila's confusion, hopes, concern for another feral child, and stirrings of love. In the end, you're left to ponder the question of what it means to be a human. I think that's why this book is so deceptively simple, when it's really dealing with some pretty profound questions.<br />Although I'm troubled with Karen Hesse's conclusion that a girl raised by dolphins is more &quot;human&quot; than the humans who care for her and study her, it does force you to stop and think about what the good qualities in human beings should be like.<br />I think my son would agree that this is a &quot;girl's book,&quot; but it's certainly one that deserves to be read, discussed and pondered.	2001-07-25

Instead we see episodes in the life of nerdish Kenny Watson, his older brother Byron who is always getting into trouble, his little sister &quot;Joey&quot; who is a little angel, their Momma who still has some of the old South in her, and Dad, a loving, but sometimes stern, man.<br />This is an important piece of historical fiction. It shows an intact African-American family, struggling with many of the same things families of other races were dealing with in those days, however one is given a taste of their fear of racial violence as Momma and Dad plan--and take--their trip into the deep South to visit Grandma Sands during those turbulent times.<br />This is an important book, but one I can only recommend with reservations. Some of the situations, and more especially some of the crude language used by Byron and his friends, would cause me to give it a PG rating. I think it's unfortunate that some authors of children's books think it's OK to use language that most educators are otherwise discouraging students from using.	2001-07-25

My son and I just finished listening with rapt attention to the audio version of &quot;Ralph S. Mouse,&quot; which is wonderfully read by actor William Roberts. Beverly Cleary's third book in her &quot;Mouse and the Motorcycle&quot; series comes to life with Roberts' many voices for characters such as Ralph, the hotel handyman Matt, and Ryan, who tries to save Matt's job by bringing Ralph to school. This audio-book is just over 2 hours long, which is ideal for use  as a classroom &quot;read-aloud,&quot; or in a car on a family trip, or for just sitting around with the family for a good listen. This tale has a wonderful atmosphere, from the threadbare carpets in the hotel, to the shiny floors at the school, where Ralph dreams of racing his motorcycle at night. This fantasy has so many true-to-life touches it fits many children's dreams of having a pet mouse in your pocket that you can talk to. Ralph has become standard fare in our elementary school library, and this audio-book is just one more fun way to experience this lovable mouse!	2001-06-28

Unlike most biographies about Lincoln, it does not end with his assassination, which allows children to focus on his humanity. While Martha Brenner's book is written for kids to &quot;step into reading,&quot; it works just as well as a read-aloud for primary grades.<br />This 48 page title could have easily been arranged into chapters for students wanting to read a &quot;chapter book,&quot; however it still meets a need for engaging non-fiction titles, notably biographies, for emerging readers.<br />This title is much more appealing to kids than a similar book by Jean Fritz, &quot;George Washington's Mother.&quot;<br />Recommended.	2001-06-14

I just finished reading the Pinkney's &quot;Duke Ellington&quot; to a first grade class in our predominantly white rural school northeast of Seattle. Being trained as a musician, but now working as a librarian, I loved the way this text really swings. When I noticed much of the slang was going over the heads of the children, I'd ask them if they knew what certain words meant. Interestingly, the one African-American girl in the class was hip to most of the jive.<br />Sure some of the terminology went right past these kids, but they got into the groove, which is carried along soulfully by the vibrant illustrations. Like another reviewer here, when I was done reading this to the kids, I wanted to hear &quot;Take the 'A' Train.&quot; Fortunately I had a CD of &quot;Duke Ellington's 16 Most Requested Songs&quot; sitting in my library, so I popped it in, and these kids were a-hoppin' and a-boppin'.<br />I think next time, I'll play the CD first. Hopefully, I'll be able to settle 'em down afterwards to hear this jazzy biography.	2001-06-14

Here, his illustrations for three verses of Francis Scott Key's poem and song, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner,&quot; provide an excellent introduction for children to the meaning behind his famous lyrics.<br />I usually read this aloud to primary classes around a patriotic holidays. This year, because of our late school year, I read it for Flag Day. Since the words and historical setting are unfamiliar to most younger students, I have begun introducing this book with &quot;The Story of 'The Star Spangled Banner,'&quot; which can be found in &quot;The Children's Book of America,&quot; edited by William J. Bennett. These two volumes make fine companions.<br />Even with this introduction, Key's text needs explaining, however with Spier's finely detailed illustrations, this task is much easier. Children love to examine the intricacies and they usually come up with some excellent comments and questions. On the page featuring Arlington National Cemetery, they ask about who died in battle, why some of the grave markers are stars instead of crosses, and why the flag is flying at half-mast.<br />Our copy of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; is nearly worn out from heavy use. That should say something about the popularity of this excellent patriotic book.	2001-06-12

It is written at a 1.7 reading level, which makes it accessible to first through third grades. In our school, the third grade teachers do a unit on communities, and this title ties in beautifully with that.<br />I like the way Joan Sweeney starts with, \\"This is me\\" and builds the concept through \\"my room,\\" \\"my house,\\" \\"my street,\\" and on to town, state, country and the world. Then she goes backwards until she concludes with \\"...everybody has their own special place on the map. Just like me.\\"	2001-05-25

This one was added because of its well-deserved status as a Caldecott Honor book (for illustrations).<br />Since I usually make an annual Spring tradition of reading &quot;Casey&quot; to some classes, I can tell you that this edition by Christopher Bing works very nicely for group read-alouds. However in this setting kids miss out on the many interesting--but smaller--details that Bing has added to each page, such as a faded newspaper clipping about &quot;the barbaric practice of using only a single ball throughout the nine innings of play...&quot; Students are also drawn to the 1880s currency--bills and coins--shown on the page that says, &quot;We'd put up even money now with Casey at the bat.&quot;<br />Christopher Bing has created a mini-museum display that many children will devour like an &quot;I Spy&quot; book, particularly if they are baseball fans or history buffs.<br />If you are not familiar with this wonderful poem, I'd put it in the same &quot;classic&quot; status as &quot;The Night Before Christmas,&quot; by Clement C. Moore; &quot;Paul Revere's Ride,&quot; by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow; or &quot;The Cremation of Sam McGee,&quot; by Robert Service.	2001-05-21

Our elementary school library just acquired two copies of &quot;Because of Winn-Dixie,&quot; because of its status as a Newbery Honor book. I gave it to one of our fourth grade teachers to preview. She devoured it, raved about the book and immediately began reading it aloud to her class. Now we have a growing list of students waiting for it on hold.<br />Before letting the kids check it out, I read it, and absolutely loved it. The other reviews here give you a good picture of what the book is about. What I liked about &quot;Winn-Dixie&quot; is that it packs a lot of grace and wisdom into an appealing scruffy dog story. For example, when Opal befriends elderly Gloria Dump, she asks her about learning &quot;the most important thing.&quot;<br />&quot;'It's different for everyone,' she said. 'You find out on your own. But in the meantime, you got to remember, you can't always judge people by the things they done. You got to judge them by what they are doing now.'&quot;<br />Quite often in the past few years I've been disappointed by titles that have received the Newbery Medal or Honor. &quot;Because of Winn-Dixie&quot; is a title that genuinely deserves this honor. In my opinion, this Honor book will become a classic, much as the Laura Ingalls Wilder Newbery Honor books of the 1930s and 1940s are still being read today.<br />Very rarely do I read a book that I insist my friends and fellow teachers read, or that I'm tempted to buy for many people. &quot;Because of Winn-Dixie&quot; falls into that category.	2001-05-18

While kids may notice that not every page has color illustrations, it does not prevent them from being drawn into the story line beginning with the wild geese flying south signaling that it's time for the other animals to prepare for winter or to leave as well.<br />New teachers and parents may not be aware of this timeless classic which can be used with primary age students in talking about late autumn, deep winter or even Groundhog's Day! Although the animals have anthropomorphic qualities, their speech is congruent with what they would actually be &quot;thinking&quot; during this season. For example, Mrs. Chipmunk says, &quot;...it's getting cold. It's time for me to retire.&quot; It's not as corny as it sounds, and any adult reading &quot;The Big Snow&quot; aloud to children may want to give each animal's &quot;voice&quot; a quality resembling its actual sound.<br />This children's classic works on many levels, not the least of which is connecting today's children with a book loved by many previous generations.	2001-05-17

For readers mainly interested in introductory information on Byzantine sacred music, I'd suggest reading the first title. This book briefly recapitulates most of his introductory remarks.<br />However, for individuals wishing to learn more about Byzantine chant, particularly as it is done in Greek, this is an excellent follow-up to the original booklet. Unfortunately, there is no glossary for those unfamiliar with many Greek terms used here. While it would be helpful to be familiar with Orthodox liturgical and musical terms such as ison, modes, troparia and triodion, there are others the reader may be able to deduce from the context.<br />This 102 page book, published in 1998 by the Institute for Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies, includes an index of proper names, and six pages of bibliography for those interested in other sources.<br />As a result of brief comments here, I hope to learn more about St. John Damascene (8th century) and St. John Koukouzelis (12th century), &quot;two great music theoreticians and hymnographers [who] played a role of first rate importance in the development of the notation of Byzantine chant.&quot; Musicians, like myself, who were trained in Western musical notation, will be fascinated with the Byzantine system explained and shown here. &quot;It's all Greek to me,&quot; but I hope to learn more.<br />I'm sure the reader is aware that there is no way to learn Byzantine chant from a book, but this title does help bring some understanding to the topic.	2001-05-16

This excellent title, from the &quot;Read it to believe it!&quot; series, reads like gripping, fast-paced fiction, but it's all based on the incredible eyewitness accounts of those who were on or near Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980.<br />Written at about a 4th grade level, this one gets checked-out a lot every May in our Washington State elementary school library. I often make an annual tradition of reading the first couple of chapters to middle grade students, and they sit there spellbound. Of course, around here, most of the students' parents--and teachers--have first-hand stories to tell about what they were doing on that fateful day.<br />At the time of this review, &quot;They Survived Mount St. Helens&quot; is out-of-print.

While baseball, and Babe Ruth, do figure into the story, it's really an intriguing look into the life of a boy, his mom and secretly unemployed dad, during the Great Depression year of 1932. Once the boy discovers that his dad is actually selling apples to make money, instead of going to his former job each morning, he learns from his friend, Jacob, how to make money selling newspapers in front of Yankee Stadium.<br />These two &quot;newsies&quot; learn that they can sell more papers by yelling out the latest headlines about Babe Ruth, such as, &quot;The Babe hits number twenty-five! Read all about it!&quot;<br />This attractive picture book is quick slice of history for young readers, while incorporating an introductory lesson in economics. It's also a lesson in love: a boy's love for his father, and a father's love for his family.<br />Terry Widener's mural-like illustrations make a nice addition to this heartwarming tale, however the slightly surreal quality makes each scene seem lifeless, when this story is about life, and love, during difficult times. Having said that, they are still attractive and colorful, and do complement the storyline.<br />And yes, Babe Ruth, does make an touching appearance in this story, set in &quot;that year they were the best team in baseball.&quot;<br />The students in our elementary school library have enjoyed this book.	2001-05-10

It instantly became a popular title, and several other classes have thoroughly enjoyed it as a read-aloud.<br />I can see &quot;Akiak&quot; becoming an annual tradition, right before the first &quot;mush&quot; of the famous Alaskan sled-dog race.<br />In frosty clear language, accompanied by his museum-quality oil paintings, Robert Blake, presents a day by day account of Mick's team, initially led by 10 year-old Akiak, until she &quot;can't run on that paw.&quot; Akiak is left at a dog drop, but refusing to be flown out, she breaks free to chase after her team, many hours behind.<br />In this &quot;incredible journey,&quot; students get a taste of the Alaskan's passion for this unique sport, learning about the hardships and rules of the race along the way. The trail map on the end papers would be helpful for those wanting to turn this into a simple geography lesson.<br />This excellent story works on many levels. This is worth reading, even if you're just looking for a heartwarming dog story!	2001-05-10

This booklet is what I've needed.<br />Here we learn that Byzantine sacred music is characterized &quot;by simplicity from undue complexity, by purity or freedom from everything sensual, ostentatious, insincere, and by unsurpassed power and spirituality.&quot;<br />Cavarnos writes, concerning the spiritual aim of this music, that it is &quot;in the first place, a means of worship and veneration; and in the second place, a means of self-perfection, of eliciting and cultivating man's higher thoughts and feelings and of choosing and eliminating his lower, undesirable ones.&quot;<br />He provides a brief background, from biblical and early church sources, on the role of hymn singing and psalmody in the worship setting. Of particular interest to me was his short explanation on why Byzantine church music does not make use of musical instruments.<br />He quotes G.I. Papadopoulos, who writes: &quot;The Fathers of the Church, in accordance with the example of the psalmodizing of our Savior and the holy Apostles, established that only vocal music be used in the churches and severely forbade instrumental music as evoking pleasure without spiritual value.&quot; At one time, I would've argued strenuously against this latter statement, but having immersed myself in this worship tradition for several years now, I see great wisdom and truth in it.<br />Among the choice quotes at the back of this booklet is the following one from St. Gregory of Sinai:<br />&quot;God is peace, beyond all tumult and shouting. Our hymns, accordingly, ought to be angelic, without tumult.&quot;<br />Interested readers may want to try to get their hands on the sequel to this booklet, &quot;Byzantine Chant,&quot; also by Constantine Cavarnos.rbade instrumental music as evoking pleasure without spiritual value.&quot; At one time, I would've argued strenuously against this latter statement, but having immersed myself in this worship tradition for several years now, I see great wisdom and truth in it. <br />Among the choice quotes at the back of this booklet is the following one from St. Gregory of Sinai:<br />&quot;God is peace, beyond all tumult and shouting.

They sat totally engaged in this fantastic journey into the world at the bottom of a school lost and found.<br />Since our school lost and found is located just outside our library, I often see children--and parents--lost in a fantasy world as they peruse all the missing items in there. In many ways, I was reminded of the dress-up box my parents had when I was a child. You could just pick up a hat, gloves or an old shirt and be mentally transported to another place or time. Mark Teague builds very effectively on this imaginative tendency in children.<br />Our 3rd and 4th graders had a brief discussion on the concepts of fiction or non-fiction, and realistic or fantasy, at the conclusion of this story. I'm sure your children will enjoy this as much as our group did. Just don't get lost in the lost and found!	2001-05-09

Tedd Arnold's comical illustrations are the perfect complement to Robin Pulver's tall tale about a dedicated school bus driver who can always make it up Tiger Hill, no matter how snowy it may get.<br />When the superintendent asks her on blizzard mornings if she can make it up Tiger Hill, Axle Annie always replies, &quot;Do snowplows plow? Do tow trucks tow? Are school buses yellow? Of course I can make it up Tiger Hill!&quot; This is how he always determines that Burskeyville Schools will stay open in stormy weather.<br />Another bus driver, Shifty Rhodes, who hates to drive in blizzard conditions, teams up with disgruntled ski resort operator, Hale Snow, who never has extra business because local schools never close for snow days. Together they come up with a plan to prevent Axle Annie from making it up Tiger Hill.<br />In our elementary school, where a majority of the students ride the school bus, and where we sometimes DO close for snow days, the kids could relate to the exaggerated personalities of the drivers, as well as the snowy conditions that every child--and some teachers--hope will shut down school once in a while. Around here, many kids probably would probably go skiing, sledding or snowboarding.<br />The repetitive line, quoted above, quickly becomes a chorus with children listening to this hilarious story. This is a fun book, and would be perfect for children in late Fall or early Winter, as the days get colder and the clouds get grayer! Recommended.	2001-05-09

Arranged in alphabetical order, readers are often introduced to more than one concept per letter, for example on the page devoted to &quot;Knight,&quot; terms like chivalrous men-at-arms, king, lord, lady, page, squire, fief and the Round Table are mentioned.<br />As another reviewer suggests, this is not really an alphabet book for younger readers. Although &quot;Illuminations&quot; is done in picture book format--and the illustrations are a pleasure to browse--because of the way Hunt lovingly approaches his subject, it is an ideal introduction to Medieval times for upper elementary grade students, and perhaps all the way up through secondary. In reading it as a school librarian, I learned some things I didn't know before.<br />In my review of Marguerite De Angeli's Newbery Awarding winning Medieval novel, &quot;The Door in the Wall,&quot; I suggested that a book like &quot;Illuminations&quot; would be ideal for introducing middle-grade readers to the language and terminology of this fascinating period of history. This is a resource that teachers and students in our elementary school often turn to. Highly recommended.<br />If you get this book, be sure to read &quot;A Note From the Author;&quot; About the Art;&quot; &quot;Suggested Reading;&quot; and the Bibliography in the back.	2001-05-07

It can be summed up that readers either like or dislike this Newbery Award winning book. There is no middle ground.<br />However, one should pay attention to the many negative reviews by &quot;bored&quot; students. It's my opinion that these students were probably not sufficiently prepared to read this short--but somewhat challenging--story. If a teacher just passes this book out, or says, &quot;Go read a Newbery book,&quot; then I don't blame them for yawning.<br />I think a student's interest level would increase if they had some sense of the language, as well as an understanding of this fascinating historical period. A quick search on the Internet reveals an interesting array of lesson plans, background materials and quizzes.<br />There are also some excellent--and easy--books that provide helpful background information, such as David Macaulay's &quot;Castle&quot; and &quot;Cathedral;&quot; Jonathan Hunt's &quot;Illuminations;&quot; Aliki's &quot;A Medieval Feast;&quot; or Joe Lasker's &quot;A Tournament of Knights.&quot; There are many more good titles available.<br />It would be beneficial if teachers would pre-read this book and make a list of the unfamiliar terms and the older forms of speech used throughout. (Better yet, it would be wonderful if the publisher would produce an edition with a glossary!) Knowing the language will open many &quot;doors in the wall&quot; for most students.<br />I've recently been doing some research on what books are considered classics for elementary age students, and &quot;A Door in the Wall,&quot; shows up on just about every list I've seen. It is a true classic in many ways.<br />On an additional note, I have a personal interest in the history of the Christian faith, and it's quite informative to note here the role the Church plays in the everyday lives of the people in Medieval England. I developed a fondness for the way the friar, Brother Luke, was portrayed here. While this is not a &quot;religious&quot; book, and is certainly appropriate for public schools, I think that it could find a nice niche in religious schools (Catholic, Protestant or Orthodox), where a discussion of this title could open doors (pun intended) to a time when Christendom was the norm.r, Brother Luke, was portrayed here.

It's not easy--in a single library session--to try to discuss the Holocaust and promote some of the titles we have in our school library. &quot;Child of the Warsaw Ghetto&quot; is probably the best, single title I can read in one sitting that covers so much territory.<br />The picture book format is a bit deceiving, since I would not opt to read this solemn story to primary grades. The muted gray colored pencil drawings fit the grim topic of this biographical account of a poor Jewish boy in Warsaw, Poland, during the time of the Nazi occupation.<br />In rapid succession we learn about the Depression, the rise of Hitler and anti-Jewish sentiment, desperate poverty, a home for orphans, Germany's invasion of Poland, fighting, forced labor, German theft of furniture and valuables, removal of Jews, the ordered wearing of the blue Star of David, the moving of 400,000 Jews into a walled ghetto, the stark living conditions, the closure of the ghetto, the order for &quot;All Jews out!&quot; and few who were able to escape, the brief--but bold--Jewish resistance, the burning of the ghetto, and the &quot;resettlement&quot; either to death camps or concentration camps. All this is seen through the eyes of Froim Baum, starting when he is still a youngster.<br />The author's note at the end of the book spells out the additional cruelty of the Nazis to initiate many of their actions on Jewish holidays. He also tells what became of Froim Baum after the war.<br />When I've finished reading this sobering account to older elementary students, I encourage them to read additional titles, such as: &quot;Diary of a Young Girl,&quot; by Anne Frank; &quot;Number the Stars,&quot; &quot;The Devil's Arithmetic,&quot; &quot;Alicia: My Story,&quot; &quot;The Endless Steppe,&quot; &quot;The Borrowed House,&quot; &quot;The Hiding Place,&quot; and &quot;Daniel's Story&quot; (to name a few).<br />This is a topic we should never forget. And since the period of history is not really covered in our curriculum, it needs to be introduced to students through well-written books on the subject, whether fiction or non-fiction. &quot;Child of the Warsaw Ghetto&quot; is a good place to start.should never forget.

He has a unique pen, ink and paint technique that brings out the details in Iktomi's dress and gear, as well as animals--such as the prairie dogs and ducks in this tale.<br />While the main text of the story is told in bold black type, the storyteller is given some hilarious commentary in gray type, which is a delight for children listening to the story. Goble also adds little captions that are fun to read aloud, or that children enjoy looking for on their own.<br />I prefer folktales that teach a moral, and here the message is clear: pride goes before a fall.	2001-05-02

The tree will give her a cup, if she finds someone to shake its branches, and so on. Finally the dwarfs agree to help out without asking anything in return, and Cluck-cluck returns to each one who agreed to help until she finally brings water to Little Tuppen, who &quot;drank water and stopped coughing. He ran chirping and scratching among the leaves as if nothing had happened.&quot;<br />If you're looking for a tale where a disobedient child gets punished, this isn't it. But you're looking for a light Scandinavian nursery tale that portrays a parent's undying love for her child, regardless of his behavior, then this one does the job.

This is the one our fourth grade teachers usually read aloud as part of their curriculum on Washington State, and it's the title that most students will come into the library to check out and read again.<br />While there are many good fictional accounts about the Oregon Trail, this is the one I'd recommend first for upper elementary grades, simply because of its basis in actual events.<br />I'd also recommend visiting the Whitman Mission in Walla Walla, if for no other reason than to see the wagon wheel ruts and the Sager names on the gravestone.

However, since it's written at about 3.5 reading level, it may be too difficult for its intended audience.<br />Also, it's a bit of a stretch as an alphabet book, since the alphabet is merely used as a vehicle for tying the photos and text together. It works for single words like bear, coyote, deer and eagle, however most children won't relate to fir tree as an &quot;F&quot; word, since the noun is actually &quot;tree.&quot; This quirk surfaces again with listings like Haida totem pole for the letter &quot;H,&quot; Northern spotted owl for &quot;N,&quot; and Mt. Rainier for &quot;R.&quot; It gets stretched further when Xerophyllum tenax appears for &quot;X,&quot; and then the child is told it's &quot;the scientific name for bear grass.&quot;<br />Having said that, students love to listen this book and look at the pictures. It works well as a read-aloud and a discussion starter. I used successfully as a companion book with &quot;Northwest Animal Babies&quot; for first grade students in our elementary school library.

York brings each character to life with his vocal inflections, his use of dynamics (loud and soft voicings) and best of all, his mastery of various accents--British, Irish and Scottish--given to the different characters. Here each &quot;person&quot; has a vivid personality, and the listener can easily picture them in his or her mind.<br />We've enjoyed the Focus on the Family dramatization, as well as the BBC version, in the past, but I'd prefer to hear the unabridged text of this C.S.

Benagh, has written a moving biographical and historical journey of an Englishman who went to Russia in 1901 to escape the disillusionment of his faith-shattering theological education. As Charles Sydney Gibbes' reputation as an English tutor in St. Petersburg grows, he comes to the attention of the royal family, whom he eventually serves for ten years until their tragic demise. Through Gibbes' letters and papers, we catch an intimate view of the Tsar, the Empress and their children in their home or on vacation, having tea, doing their studies, playing games and going to Russian Orthodox services. Their lives are placed into historical context with quotes from the biographies, letters and papers of people who knew them.<br />Sadly, Gibbes is among the first to investigate the fateful Ipatiev house in Ekatarinburg, where the Romanovs and their entourage were murderously slaughtered by the Bolsheviks. Due to his intimate knowledge of the Romanovs, as well as his command of the Russian language, Gibbes continues working in Russia for a time for the British High Command. He eventually ends up in Manchuria, working for the Chinese Maritime Service, during which time he adopts a teenaged Russian orphan and studies firsthand various Eastern religions.<br />At the age of 52, Gibbes decides to return to his Christian roots, but he is once more shattered by politics in the Anglican Church. After a much soul searching, he embraces the Orthodox Church, where, back in England, he is tonsured as a monk and then ordained into the priesthood.<br />As Father Nicholas Gibbes, he spends the remaining years of life devoted to the Orthodox faith in England, and to preserving the memory of the Romanov family with the many artifacts and relics he personally collected.<br />While this outstanding book is called a &quot;spiritual journey,&quot; the spiritual journey is actually a pretty slender thread through these turbulent times until the last two chapters. It works as an interesting biography within this period of history, as an intimate portrait of the royal family, as a small slice of Russian (and English) history, and finally as a spiritual odyssey.

A few animals are featured in a two-page spread.<br />Using this book would be a good way to learn the correct terms for specific animal babies, as well as proper names for a few animal body parts.<br />While reading this book to a first grade class in my library, each page caused the children to raise their hands wanting to tell their own animal stories. This read-aloud session could have easily stretched into a half-hour, much longer than reading the text straight through requires.<br />Despite a few &quot;big words,&quot; young students are attracted to this book.

Now, many years later, I can say that I'm glad I did.<br />As an elementary school librarian, this is the first book I recommend to teachers and parents, as well as to adults who suspect they may have an attention problem.

As an elementary school librarian, who was diagnosed as an adult with ADHD, and who lives in a household with other ADHD people, I highly recommend this book!<br />&quot;Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key,&quot; is a fast-paced novel written at about the 5th grade level. Since we acquired two copies in our library about a month ago, it has been constantly checked out! I've had a student and his mom come into the library specifically to thank me for bringing this book to their attention and for discussing it with the his sixth grade class.<br />If you want to crawl into the mind and body of a youngster with attention problems, spend some time with &quot;Joey Pigza.&quot; What this kid does with his body, I've done in my mind my entire life, and I'm thankful to a number of medical professionals for helping me discover that I really was &quot;wired&quot; differently. (The book that really got me to seek help was &quot;Driven to Distraction,&quot; by Edward M. Hallowell, which I also highly recommend.)<br />The reviewer who attributes Joey's problems to his physical environment, overstates the situation. Yes, diet, chemicals and emotional problems can contribute to attention problems, but as a person who has eaten healthy foods for many years, and who has very few chemicals in the home, I can attest that ADD/ADHD people are usually born this way. I found relief through meds. Last year, I secretly took myself off the meds, and people around me noticed the difference within weeks. So, now I know it really does make a difference.<br />Some people are misdiagnosed or over-medicated, which is why it's important to see a doctor who knows this disorder inside and out, like Joey finally did at the end of the book. This book should be read by any students, teachers or parents who either have attention problems, or who know someone who does. It would make an excellent read-aloud and discussion starter in an upper elementary classroom.	2001-04-12

I've read this fun book to several primary classes in our elementary school library, to the great delight of the children. It's a cumulative story in the sense that more and more people join Stella in the search for her missing library book, because &quot;it's due today by five o'clock.&quot;<br />But another fun aspect of this story is the mystery behind the title of the runaway book. As Stella and her entourage meet each new person who has seen the book, another clue is given about the title, although it is never given. However by the time children have finished hearing &quot;Stella Louella,&quot; they know that she had checked out &quot;Goldilocks and the Three Bears.&quot; My students were thrilled and proud of uncovering the mystery before we finished the book!<br />As a librarian, my favorite part of the book is when Mrs. Graham, the librarian in the story, says her favorite part of the book is the same as with every book, &quot;when someone READS it!&quot;	2001-03-29

As our students read their way across America by earning miles, I decided to read &quot;The Scrambled States of America&quot; to every class in our school from grades 1-6. There is not a class that hasn't enjoyed this hilarious book.<br />It's been interesting for me as the librarian to see how the different ages respond to the text and pictures. The first class that heard it, fifth grade, had just completed their state reports, and they were in tune with the book from beginning to end, adding all kinds of information they had recently learned. It was a wonderful discussion.<br />My favorite illustration in this book is where &quot;states all over the country were waking up, having their first cups of coffee, reading the morning paper, and enjoying the beautiful sunrise.&quot; When I ask the students to look closely, they first laugh at silly things like Florida shaving, but then they notice that our state, Washington, is still asleep. Pretty quickly, the kids pick up on the time zones, and we end up talking about the time differences in our country.<br />Our kids get mockingly upset that Washington hasn't arrived to the big all-state party, because they are convinced we'd either bring apples or water (from all our rain)!<br />The students' favorite page is when they get to see the states all scrambled up. They love searching for our state, and other states they've studied or visited!<br />This is an entertaining book, one that I never would have predicted to be a hit with all grades. I took a gamble, and I was pleasantly surprised. They love it, and they learn something about geography while they're at it!	2001-03-22

Two of those legends are--obviously--the Sasquatch and Mount Saint Helens, but you'll have to read the book to discover the third. To tell you now would spoil 1/3 of your fun in reading this thrilling book.<br />Whether you consider this title realistic fiction or fantasy will depend entirely on your view of the Sasquatch (or Bigfoot). I prefer to see it as a fantasy, but that doesn't take away from the excitement of this book. This is a &quot;guys&quot; book, that girls will also enjoy reading.	2001-03-19

A few years ago, my wife and I were looking for a book on the history of Christianity to help us in homeschooling our teenaged son. What made this a bit challenging is that my wife is a Protestant, and I had recently become an Orthodox Christian, so we wanted a book that treated our respective traditions objectively and with respect.<br />My wife came home from a conference sponsored by the Association of Christian Schools International with a copy of &quot;The Story of Christianity.&quot; Since I'd seen textbooks in Protestant Christian schools with a not-so-subtle anti-Catholic bias, and that treated the Orthodox as virtually non-existent, I viewed this title with suspicion.<br />The first thing that began to set me at ease was that it had been written by two scholars, one Roman Catholic and the other Protestant. I figured that they would at least show respect for each other's traditions, which I quickly found to be true.<br />Next, I began taking a close look at the opening chapters dealing with early Church history, covering &quot;The Roots of Christianity&quot; (starting in the Old Testament) and going to &quot;The Conversion of Europe&quot; (including the Great Schism of 1054). What I found was an objective, fair treatment of the early days in both the East and the West, when there was general agreement throughout the Church on orthodoxy, as well as the tragic differences that developed due to cultural problems (such as language differences and poor communication, political shifts (such as moving the capital from Rome to what became known as Constantinople), and differences of opinion on the role of the papacy. With the final split in 1054, any hope of reconciliation ended with the Crusades from the West and the sack of Constantinople in 1204.<br />From this point on, the book takes on a spirit of bi-partisanship as it develops the history of Christianity in the West, giving a scant two pages per chapter to the Eastern Orthodox, covering the next 1000 years. While this beautiful volume might mainly be of interest to readers from the West, with its emphasis on the development of the Catholic Church and the many denominations of Protestantism, through the shortcoming of omission, many readers may be left with the impression that--since Eastern Orthodox worship is virtually unchanged in 1700 years--not much else has gone on in the East either.<br />However, if one pays attention to the captions and sidebars, the reader discovers tidbits about the East that deserve greater treatment than it gets here. One caption on &quot;An Orthodox View of the Trinity&quot; mentions the theological debate on the Trinity, which surrounds the statement in the Nicene Creed about the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father, but the text fails to amplify the controversy surrounding the filioque (&quot;and the Son&quot;) added by the West, without the approval of an Ecumenical Council.<br />One also learns from other captions that &quot;throughout the medieval period, the standard of education was far higher in Constantinople than in the West,&quot; or &quot;for 1000 years Constantinople had been the home of the finest Greek scholars.&quot; If the Renaissance and Reformation get dozens of pages, why not the glorious Orthodox Byzantine Empire, the longest lasting empire in history? Why not spend more pages on the accomplishments of those fine Greek scholars?<br />Another caption states, &quot;In the early 1700s missionaries from the Russian Orthodox church became active through the harsh region of Siberia,&quot; telling further how these efforts extended to Alaska in 1794 and &quot;all the way down to San Francisco.&quot; This is an amazing missionary story that has yet to be read by most Westerners!<br />Brief mention is also made of Peter the Great's efforts to Westernize Russia, and in the process he almost dismantled the Russian Orthodox Church, the very institution that brought unity to this great, and vast, nation.<br />I'm also afraid thatWestern readers will be left with the impression that Orthodox Christians remain in the East, overlooking a growing Orthodox presence in the Western hemisphere, beginning with immigrant groups from Eastern Europe, as well as Arab Christians, but now attracting Westerners (like me) who have discovered the rich tradition of spirituality and worship within Orthodoxy.<br />The omissions in this book are too numerous to mention in detail, but don't get me wrong, I like this book! It's beautifully layed out, in the style of Dorling Kindersly's popular Eyewitness books, with colorful prints, drawings, maps and photographs on every page. In my opinion, this makes this volume superior to most Christian history textbooks. Also, I do think it treats all three major traditions respectfully, just not equally or proportionately.<br />I would still recommend that this book be in every Christian home (yes, even Orthodox), as it helps us to understand one another better. It would be attractive on a coffee table, and it is conducive to browsing. It would also be a welcome addition to church and school libraries...Western readers will be left with the impression that Orthodox Christians remain in the East, overlooking a growing Orthodox presence in the Western hemisphere, beginning with immigrant groups from Eastern Europe, as well as Arab Christians, but now attracting Westerners (like me) who have discovered the rich tradition of spirituality and worship within Orthodoxy.<br />The omissions in this book are too numerous to mention in detail, but don't get me wrong, I like this book!

After all, icons are hardly a part of English Christian tradition. The tradition to which icons belong is a complex one, and one that is alien to many Western Christians.&quot;<br />Thus begins a thoroughly researched, well written and sympathetic introduction for Western readers to the icons of the Eastern Orthodox Church. As a matter of fact, this book is so highly regarded by the Orthodox, it has been published in United States by one of our premier Orthodox publishers, St. Vladimir's Seminary Press.<br />&quot;Doors of Perception&quot; is divided into three parts: the main body of Baggley's text covering historical, biblical, spiritual, visual and environmental aspects of iconography; followed by Richard Temple's interesting essay on the painting of icons; and finally a series of seventeen plates, with an informative commentary on each icon. This latter section pretty much follows highlights of the Orthodox liturgical year.<br />I would recommend this to people from the Western tradition who may be curious about icons and their role in Eastern Orthodox worship, or to people--like me--who, after a life in the Western Christian tradition, have decided to &quot;face East.&quot; I would even recommend this to those interested in icons as religious art (although the Orthodox don't view it as such), or to those interested in art history.	2001-02-27

It tells about an event in 1859, when San Juan Island, in what is now Washington State, was claimed by both British trappers and American owners. Tensions were rising, when a British pig was shot in an American garden. The real potential for war existed following this incident. Eventually this was peacefully resolved, resulting in the establishment of the border between what is now America and Canada in that region.<br />Betty Baker does an excellent job of making this ultimately humorous event readable for young readers. This little book experienced a revival of interest during the Washington State Centennial in 1989. In my opinion, it's still a must-read for students in Washington.<br />The one drawback to this book is that the illustrations depict the local natives as Plains Indians, and not as Coast Salish. This is a minor distraction, since the story centers on the struggles between the white settlers.	2001-02-23

Since a number of my Protestant friends are reading and talking about this little 93 page book, I decided to give it a quick read. In it, Wilkinson promotes &quot;breaking through to the blessed life&quot; through the daily recitation of a short--and mostly forgotten--prayer tucked within a list of genealogies in 1 Chronicles 4:9-11. The prayer states:&quot;Oh that you would bless me and enlarge my territory! Let your hand be with me, and keep me from harm so that I will be free from pain&quot; (NIV).Since my own prayer life has been undergoing a transformation over the past couple of years, I was impressed by a number of similarities between what Wilkinson advocates and what I've learned, so far, of the Orthodox Christian rule of prayer.1. He advocates the daily use of a biblically-based fixed prayer.2. He suggests that the purpose of the prayer is to transform the one who prays (he uses the term &quot;revolutionize&quot;).3. One of the focuses of the prayer is to ask for God's blessing, which he states is spiritual and not material (in contrast to the &quot;name it and claim it&quot; types of prayer advocated in some Protestant circles).4. In seeking to have God work through us normal people, he states it in the following mathematical formula: My willingness and weakness + God's will and supernatural power = my expanding territoryWilkinson defines &quot;expanding territory&quot; as &quot;where you ask God to enlarge your life so you can make a greater impact for Him.&quot;5. He states we come to a place of dependence on God (in contrast to the independence advocated in this world) when everything goes against common sense; when it contradicts your previous life experience; when it seems to disregard your feelings, training, and need for security; and when it sets you up to look like a fool and a loser.6. Wilkinson stresses that we need to do more than to ask for strength to endure temptation, but 'to ask God to keep us away from temptation and keep the devil at bay in our lives.'7. In saying we should want to be &quot;more honorable,&quot; Wilkinson compares it to striving for God's highest reward, as when St. Paul talks about pressing on toward the goal.8. Wilkinson assures the reader that once you set in motion this process your faith will be given a good testing. The cycle can be broken by sin, however if you have been in this &quot;cycle,&quot; the grief over sin will be deeper. The reader is encouraged to &quot;rush back into God's presence and make things right, whatever it takes.&quot;The above summary contains elements advocated by most, if not all, liturgical traditions in Christianity. In some ways, I think Wilkinson may be responding to a need within much of Protestantism, where traditional forms of prayer have been abandoned in the past 100 years for more spontaneous, or even charismatic, ones. There is a growing need being expressed in Evangelicalism to return to various forms of fixed prayers. A recent issue of Christianity Today highlights this issue.My main regret over this little book is that Wilkinson has devoted so much energy and time (he states over half his life) to promoting the Prayer of Jabez. As a Christian, one would think he would have been more productive (dare I say obedient?) to spend his time and energy promoting the Lord's Prayer, which our Lord Jesus Himself introduces with the phrase, &quot;This is how you should pray&quot; (Matthew 6:9).The Orthodox believe in praying fixed prayers at least once a day, but at the heart of each set of prayers is the Lord's Prayer. After all, this is how we should pray. I think it would be wise for those who read &quot;The Prayer of Jabez,&quot; to take some of the concepts promoted by Wilkinson and use them, on a daily basis, with the Lord's Prayer instead. I'm reminded of one of my last times as a music leader with my former Protestant youth group, when I asked them to pray the Lord's Prayer with me, and several of them didn't even know it. That's a sad commentary on how far things have gone from the most honored of Christian prayers.So, let's replace the Prayer of Jabez with the Prayer of Jesus. It'll &quot;revolutionize&quot; your life.mmentary on how far things have gone from the most honored of Christian prayers.So, let's replace the Prayer of Jabez with the Prayer of Jesus.

This position is one that he continues to update, and modify, and is also popularized in the writings of others, such as the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series, by Tim Lahaye and Jerry Jenkins.<br />Back then, as I began my own studies of the Book of Revelation, I was shocked to discover that most major Bible commentaries did not share the view promoted by Lindsey and other preachers of the &quot;pre-tribulation rapture.&quot; Not only that, I learned that this particular interpretation was a novel one in Christian history, and relatively recent, first appearing around the 1800s.<br />Over the years, as I have retreated from this minority view (with many parallels to those of the Jehovah's Witnesses and Seventh Day Adventists) to a more traditional position, I have often wished for a volume that would present the historic view of the Christian Church on the Second Coming of Christ in a clear and thoroughly researched manner, especially as it pertains to views popular in many circles of Evangelical Protestantism. This book by T.L. Frazier is that book!<br />I would recommend this volume to students of biblical prophecy, to people who want to critically examine the views of pre-tribulation writers like Lindsey and Lahaye, and to people who love Church history (or theology) and would like a survey of the historical views of mainline Chrisitianty (whether Orthodox, Catholic or Protestant) on this important subject. Although Frazier is an Orthodox writer, it is my opinion that this book represents the views of most Christians since the days of the Early Church, which is: the Second Coming of Christ is a one-time event, not one that has &quot;pre&quot; and &quot;post&quot; (or even &quot;mid&quot;) aspects to it, and He's coming to judge everybody, and not just coming to rescue a select few.<br />I will say that this volume is not always easy reading. Since Frazier has done extensive research, he may have provided more details than the average reader cares about. Having said that, it's still an important work and worth the effort. One will find sobering information on how some views of biblical prophecy have influenced American foreign policy, particularly toward modern day Israel, with the sad impact that many American Christians are promoting the persecution of fellow Christians in the Middle East.<br />The major shortcoming of this excellent title is that it has no index.

It was an important book in my spiritual journey, and I gave several copies away. Over the years I've learned that Lindsey promotes a view of end time prophecy not shared by most reputable biblical scholars. More importantly, it flies in the face of the historical position of the Christian Church (whether Protestant, Catholic or Orthodox) from the days of the Early Church to present times.<br />Basically, the vast majority of Christian teaching states that the Second Coming of Christ is a one-time event, and that He's coming to judge everybody. The Church traditionally has never supported the position that Jesus will rescue a select few through a &quot;rapture.&quot; As a matter of fact, the rapture view is a relatively new innovation, only having been around for a couple of hundred years, and having been brought into the mainstream through writings such as &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth.&quot;<br />For readers who wish to re-examine the views of Lindsey and others like him who teach a pre-tribulation rapture, I would suggest taking a look at a book available here at ...... called &quot;A Second Look at the Second Coming,&quot; by T.L. Frazier. His research is impressive and quite thorough, and he leaves some embarrassing holes in Hal Lindsey's position.<br />One of my college roomates is a Christian largely because of reading &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot; in the 70s, and he has spent his adult years in Mexico as a missionary. This book has been influential in the lives of many, but in my opinion, it's time to take a second look Hal Lindsey and others like him.	2001-02-14

I was just handed this attractive story about Saint Valentine by a 3rd &amp; 4th grade teacher who is using it in her classroom as part of her Valentine's Day activities. I'm the librarian at a public elementary school, so I read through it quickly with great delight. Since we don't have it in our collection, it is one I hope we can acquire before Valentine's Day next year!<br />While this story is about a saint of the Christian faith, the religious aspect of the story is toned down and not preachy. While Valentine's faith, and his role as a priest, are woven into the story, the text emphasizes his role as a physician and his relationship with the blind daughter of a Roman jailer who seeks healing. The &quot;Notes on the text&quot; at the end of the book explain Valentine's connection with the celebration of love.<br />The warm colored mosaics, with their icon-like appearance, are a fitting complement to the text. This book is visually appealing, and both the size of text and word choice make it appropriate for primary and middle grade readers.<br />It's my opinion that &quot;Saint Valentine&quot; would be a welcome addition to both school and church libraries, as well as in the collections of families who want to see historical, and saintly, figures like this come to life.	2001-02-14

This 1988 collection of historical tinted postcards, assembled by a renowned local author and historian, was timed just right for the Washington State Centennial in 1989. It's now a collector's item for both Pacific Northwest history buffs and postcard collectors.<br />The sections, with only captions and brief comments by Lane Morgan, are named: &quot;From Sea to Inland Sea,&quot; &quot;Seattle,&quot; &quot;West of the Mountains,&quot; &quot;Cascades,&quot; &quot;Inland Empire,&quot; &quot;Farm and Forest,&quot; and &quot;Celebrations.&quot;<br />Since the elementary school where I am a librarian is located in a community originally established for the logging industry, students are always fascinated to see size of the logs, and even the lumber cut from those logs, as well as log cabins, oxen on a skid road, and log jams in the rivers. They are amazed to see a family's home built out of a single tree stump around 1910!<br />Other fascinating postcards include the native people, both the coastal and the inland tribes. Granted, this is a nostalgic look at Washington State, with early camping and skiing on Mount Rainier, irrigated orchards in Wenatchee Valley, the beloved &quot;Kalakala&quot; ferry boat on Puget Sound, and historic buildings, including the &quot;highest and finest and best known office building on the Pacific Coast,&quot; the Smith Tower in Seattle.<br />While it may not seem like &quot;history&quot; to me, I remember as a 12 year-old in 1962 collecting the postcards shown here from the Century 21 Exposition, better known as the Seattle World's Fair, with painted views of the Space Needle and the Monorail.<br />This is a fun book to have for lovers of local history and nostalgia. This is one of those books that proves the old proverb, &quot;A picture is worth a thousand words.&quot; It would be nice to see it back in print, but I imagine someone will come out with a new, updated version...perhaps in time for our bi-centennial in 2089!	2001-02-08

My wife and I always kept the first edition of this wonderful restaurant guide in the car, and we are just as happy with this newer addition.<br />Although I grew up in Seattle, we've lived about 45 minutes out of town for over 20 years, and it's hard to keep up with the restaruant scene when we return &quot;home&quot; sporadically. We're the kind of people who prefer to avoid fast food joints and chains, and being school teachers, we're always looking for a good deal. On top of that, we're always open for something off the beaten path. This guide has never failed to tip us off to a satisfying dining experience.<br />We recently attended a performance in West Seattle, and checked out &quot;Cheap Eats&quot; for some family-friendly restaurants in that area, since we had three kids along with us. We had it narrowed down to three possibilities, but the kids decided on a delightful Italian restaurant. Good food, good price, and great atmosphere for all of us.<br />Fortunately, many of our favorites from the first edtion survived in the new book. One of them is The Sunlight Cafe in the Roosevelt area, where we can always count on a tasteful vegetarian meal.<br />This guide has two helpful indexes in the back, one for the type of cuisine--whether it be Japanese, Thai, or Italian--and the other for listings by Seattle neighborhoods. The main body of the book has the restaurant reviews listed alphabetically. The reviews do a helpful job of describing the menu, what's good and what's not, the atmosphere, hours, whether or not credit cards and checks are accepted, and if live music is available.<br />If you're in Seattle, get this one and keep it in the car!	2001-02-08

What we've discovered is that, while factually interesting, the boys get turned off to the love story that weaves in and out. Now we mainly recommend this to upper elementary girls, and those who do read it end up wanting to read more titles in the series.<br />I've only read the first book in this series, which I thoroughly enjoyed, but my wife is currently devouring, and loving, the next titles in the series.<br />Readers who know the streets of Seattle will begin to recognize where many of the names came from. Personally, I grew up near Louisa Street. I wonder where that name came from?<br />For people interested in Washington State, Seattle, or the Oregon Trail, this book is highly recommended. This title was recommended by the Washington State Centennial Committee back in 1989.	2001-02-07

There are only a few common characters, so it doesn't really matter what order you read them in.<br />I like to compare these books to the Laura Ingalls Wilder titles. They were quite popular during our Washington State Centennial in 1989, and still get read by students who like historical fiction.<br />It's nice to see a review here by a student who says this is her favorite book. That says a lot. These titles are not on any &quot;top ten&quot; lists, but are certainly worth reading. Beatty has a knack for bringing an unknown part of history to life, and adding adventure, as well as accuarately describing the weather and locale of this region.<br />I recommend this book and the other two titles!	2001-01-31

In my opinion they are written as well.<br />After reading these books years ago, I took my family on a vacation to the Long Beach (Washington) penninsula where the stories are set and we were able to locate many of the landmarks mentioned in the books. There is the ring of historical accuracy, as well as the cold wet climate of this region.<br />For any students looking for historical fiction from a locale not usually written about, these books are to be recommended. They should appeal to fourth grade students and above.<br />All three of these titles were recommended reading by the Washington State Centennial committee in 1989.

While the book is dated (which is probably why it is out of print), I find the index helpful when I want to quickly look up the background to older songs.<br />Reading this chapter by chapter, one can get a clear idea of the &quot;greatest hits&quot; of each era.<br />This is a highly readable book, which I recommend to any fan of American music, or even American history. This one certainly deserves to be updated and republished.	2001-01-29

Whenever teachers in our predominantly white elementary school ask me to recommend a title pertaining to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., or to African American history, this is one of the first books I suggest for grades 4, 5 and 6.The question and answer format lends itself to reading aloud and then discussing topics that come up, like segregation, white supremacy, the Montgomery bus boycott, etc. I recently read part of this book to a fourth grade class who just had &quot;segregation&quot; as a vocabulary word. The students were quite attentive and asked some excellent questions.The title is a bit misleading in that some might view it as a biography of Dr. King. While many sections do draw upon personal events in Dr. King's life, such as when he was a youngster riding  in the car with his father and he heard a police officer call his dad &quot;boy.&quot; Or again, when he was young and he was told he could no longer play with his white friends. But as the title says, it's really about if you lived at the &quot;time&quot; of Dr. King. Therefore, it's an excellent introduction to many aspects of the Civil Rights movement.While the watercolor illustrations are an improvement over the black and white drawings in earlier editions of this &quot;If You Lived At the Time Of&quot; series, in this case I think the text could be more fully enhanced with actual photographs, especially since many of these illustrations are copied from well-known photographs.All in all, this is an excellent introduction to the Civil Rights Movement for upper-elementary students (and apparently for middle-school students according to another review here). This is one title that, in my opinion, should be in every elementary school in the nation. Recommended.	2001-01-24

In this day, when a Christian classic is often considered to be a book written 50 or 100 years ago, such as one of my favorites, &quot;Mere Christianity,&quot; by C.S. Lewis, it may be a little intimidating for modern readers to consider a volume written during the 4th century by one of the acknowledged leaders of the ancient Christian Church. This is one such work that I've ashamedly ignored for over 30 years--until recently--despite the fact that I've been a huge fan of C.S. Lewis, who wrote the Introduction for this fine translation in about 1944.In both the introduction, and in the words of St. Athanasius, one can quickly see where Lewis developed many of his ideas for &quot;Mere Christianity.&quot; Lewis writes here: &quot;Measured against the ages &quot;mere Christianity&quot; turns out to be no insipid interdenominational transparency, but something positive, self-consistent, and inexhaustible.&quot;Another reviewer here refers to this book as Catholic, which, unfortunately, may possibly scare away some Protestant readers. However, one could also call it Orthodox (or orthodox), in the sense that St. Athanasius wrote at a time in history when there was only One Undivided Church, whether one calls it Catholic or Orthodox. He was responding to the heresies of his day (and I might add that many of those heresies are still around in one form or another). In doing so, St. Athanasius helped to codify what all Christians everywhere believed about the Incarnation of Christ in those days. As Lewis says in his introduction, some of the best devotional reading is in doctrinal books. This is one such book, but don't let it scare you away, like it did me for 30 years. It's well worth the read, and not as challenging as one would assume.An additional bonus to the St. Vladimir's Press 1996 edition is the appendix: &quot;The Letter of St. Athanasius to Marcellinus on the Interpretation of the Psalms.&quot; In this gem, St. Athanasius provides delightful devotional and theological background to the Book of Psalms, which many call the Prayer Book of the Bible. This appendix alone is worth the purchase price of the book (but be sure you get the right edition).ical background to the Book of Psalms, which many call the Prayer Book of the Bible.

Here's an excpert from the first one:We are so excited to tell you that L's PSA test done last week is at 2.9 down from 4 which is well within the normal range.  His cholesterol is down from 221 to 172 which is also in the normal range.  All other blood tests and the physical exam shows him very healthy.  He is at his optimum weight down 35 lb. from this summer, he has been off his blood pressure medicine he started in June since October and it is in the normal range and he has almost completely quit snoring.  The first good sleep S has had in 7 or 8 years!We are attributing these great results to the Lord's leading us to a book called &quot;A Cancer Battle Plan,&quot; by Dave and Anne Fraum which then took us to Colorado Springs, Colorado, to go through the HealthQuarters Ministries program which Dave and Anne started to help people learn to regain their health the way God intended. We learned that if given the right conditions our body has an amazing ability to heal itself from many ailments which has been evident in Lyle and hundreds of other people.  &quot;Prostate Health in 90 days without drugs or surgery,&quot; by Larry Clapp, is another source that uses basically the same plan with a couple tweaks.  &quot;Healing Prayer&quot; is a book that J gave us last Christmas that didn't get read until I found it behind the couch in the motorhome one day in early Oct. after L's diagnosis and boy does it apply to where we are.  How did he know that we would use that book just when we needed it?  God is in control of even the gifts we give at Christmas if we let Him be.Then my friends sent a follow-up note that said:I'm sorry to hear of [your] ailments.  I know you have probably had a zillion suggestions but with the results we have seen with L and myself and many others with varying ailments I would encourage you to pick up Dave Frauhm's book &quot;A Cancer Battle Plan&quot; and consider following his program.

While the feast has been secularized over the years, and is celebrated by Catholics, Protestants, Jews and atheists alike, there is always an acknowledgment of the Bishop of Myra and his many charitable deeds back in the 4th century.<br />With this background, I was drawn to &quot;The Saint Nicholas Secret: A Story of Childhood Faith Reborn in the Heart of the Father.&quot; The author, Dennis E. Engleman, tells about the most disappointing day in his life, when his mother told him St. Nicholas wasn't real, and how it left a long-lasting emptiness in his heart. He sought to avoid any reference to St. Nicholas with his own children, in the hopes of sparing them the same disappointment. But kids being kids, he was asked the inevitable question.<br />Engleman goes on to describe a business trip to Europe, and a life-changing string of events. While on a tour of the Chartres Cathedral in France, the guide explains a sculpture they are viewing, and he is shocked to discover he is talking about a real person known as St. Nicholas. He hears some of the same stories I heard in my childhood, such as the one about the young bishop Nicholas saving three young women from poverty by secretly providing money for their dowries to their poor father.<br />Then he skeptically listens to stories of miracles associated with the remains, or relics, of St. Nicholas, originally buried in Myra (now in Turkey), but which were moved to Bari, Italy in 1087. As it turned out, Bari was the final destination on Engleman's business trip, so he decided to visit the Basilica Pontifica Di. S. Nicola. There at the dark candlelit crypt, by the sarcophagus of St. Nicholas, in the wonder of the place, he recites a letter he had written as a child:<br />Dear St. Nicholas,<br />Please bring me something nice. I have tried to be good. I love you.<br />Your friend,<br />Dennis Engleman<br />I cannot begin to describe the power of the experience that follows, but suffice it to say he receives a &quot;gift...finding the hope and faith which had been lost long ago.&quot;<br />When I picked up this book, I thought it was designed to be read aloud to children, but parents (or any adult) should really read it first. It reawakens some of those childhood wonders and disappointments that many of us have experienced, and then helps to build a sense of awe and wonder at this wonderful saint, recognised by all Christian traditions, who really lived and served Christ faithfully, and continues to live in heaven.<br />The book concludes with &quot;Suggestions to Parents,&quot; which will help readers decide how to handle the St. Nicholas question in their own homes. There is also an Epilogue which quotes extensively from a twelfth century document about St. Nicholas.<br />This book is a little gem, a quick read, but well worth the time, especially during the Advent season when we hear so much about Santa Claus, whose name is derived from Sinterklaas, and whose name is really St. Nicholas.love you.<br />Your friend,<br />Dennis Engleman<br />I cannot begin to describe the power of the experience that follows, but suffice it to say he receives a &quot;gift...finding the hope and faith which had been lost long ago.&quot;<br />When I picked up this book, I thought it was designed to be read aloud to children, but parents (or any adult) should really read it first.

The lush, romanticized illustrations--in the same tradition as Norman Rockwell--by renowned American artist N.C. Wyeth, are what first draws young readers to this book. While the paintings taken from Wyeth's murals may not always line up with the clear, concise writing of Robert San Souci, it doesn't detract from the narrative.<br />This is a classy book for middle grade students, providing a readable account of the Pilgrim's journey aboard the Mayflower and first year in New England. While the illustrations may be idealized, San Souci leaves no doubt that life was difficult for the settlers of Plymouth.<br />Notes at the end of the book provide interesting and helpful background on the writing of the book and information about the artist, who died in 1945, and the murals that are the source of these illustrations.<br />This is a nice addition for information on New England colonial life, as well as the feast of Thanksgiving.	2000-11-21

The previous edition of this book, published in 1973, has been a favorite introduction to the Pilgrims for primary students in our school for many years. Written at about a third grade reading level, it works as a readable chapter book, as well as a quick read-aloud. The black, white and turquoise drawings in the older version were adequate, but the text always deserved more detailed and interesting illustrations. While I have not see this new edition, it appears that this situation has now been remedied.<br />My students have always taken an interest in the kid's perspective of life aboard the Mayflower and during the first year at Plymouth. They love to know that the Pilgrims took two dogs and a cat with them. They wonder about the &quot;same old salted beef and fish&quot; that had to be eaten. They plug their noses when they think about the Pilgrims wearing &quot;the same clothes every day,&quot; even sleeping in them.<br />They marvel at the straw roofs of the new homes being set on fire by sparks that flew up the chimney. They are stunned to learn that good manners meant children had to stand during meals, and that they could only speak when spoken to by an adult. Then my students smack their lips at the many foods that were eaten at the first Thanksgiving: wild turkeys, geese, ducks, deer, lobsters, clams, oysters and fish, not to mention the many vegetables, and of course, popcorn.<br />I look forward to adding the new edition of this classic to our library collection.	2000-11-18

As an elementary school librarian, I have been disappointed with many of the recent Newbery Medal winning books, mainly because it seemed like adults were selecting books that they thought young people SHOULD read. Many recent Newbery winning books just sit on  our shelves.Therefore, when I added &quot;Holes&quot; to our collection, simply because it had received the medal, I expected to see yet another title collecting dust. To my surprise, this book has been constantly checked out since we received it, and young people, especially boys, are always talking about this book.As some of the other reviews have suggested, this book is a bit quirky, but some of the mysterious features of the story propel the reader forward and Sachar does a nice job of filling in the holes by the time you reach the end.Stanley and &quot;Zero&quot; are two boys down on their luck, who become friends in a terrible place. As fate would have it, the misfortunes that brought them together turn out to be interrelated.&quot;Holes&quot; is another new book that gets young people to read, much like the Harry Potter phenomenon. Not only that, it gets them to think and talk about what they've been reading. Based on that, this book is recommended.	2000-10-24

I'd just like to add my endorsement to all the other enthusiastic reviews of &quot;The Clown of God.&quot; It is one of my all time favorite read-alouds in the days approaching Christmas. Primary grade students will listen in awe to this inspiring tale and absorb dePaola's rich illustrations. It's one of the few books that mentions God in a non-preachy manner that can still be read in (most) public schools. While the story concludes with the clown giving his best for the Madonna and Child following the &quot;procession of the gifts,&quot; its message transcends most faith traditions.	2000-10-19

This version, adapted in 1964 by the author from a story he heard as a child, centers around big brother Dave, who is always playing practical jokes on Ma, Pa and Little Chub, his younger  brother. Their pet monkey, a gift from a sailor uncle, plays a key role in the climax of this tale, as Dave gets his &quot;come-uppance.&quot;<br />The &quot;fraids&quot; are anything you can't see in the dark that make you afraid. Dave pretends to be a fraid to scare little Chub, who is coming in from the fields at dusk, but the monkey imitates him behind his back, giving him a lesson he'll never forget.<br />It's unfortunate that this title is out-of-print, but it's a fun, just a little &quot;scary,&quot; introduction to folktales from the South. I imagine it could be special-ordered or found at a public or school library. A few words in this version are a bit archaic, but it's easy to replace terms like &quot;trowsers&quot; with &quot;pants.&quot; This story works with kids, with or without a Southern dialect.	2000-10-17

Young Jacob awakensto the &quot;Woooo&quot; of the wind outside his window, only todiscover that his bedside lamp won't turn on. While he tries toreassure his white, furry dog, Biff, as they wander through the scary,dark--and noisy--house, looking for his parents, he is actually tryingto reassure himself.<br />I have never heard the tape that another reviewof this title refers to, but I love to read this story aloud toprimary students, making the most of the wonderful, slightly scarysounds described in the story.<br />The comforting ending has the family,Mom, Dad, Jacob and Biff, tucked into the couch bed downstairs as Dadblows the candle out. Donald Carrick's illustrations help bring theeeriness, and then the ending coziness, to life.<br />This is another oneof my favorite October read-alouds, along with &quot;Big Fraid, LittleFraid,&quot; and other titles.	2000-10-17

In many ways, it reminds me of first-hand stories I heard from my parents and older siblings about the hardships--and the creativity--of ordinary people during those very difficult years.<br />This well-written story takes the reader through a year in Anna's life, as her mother arranges to have a new coat made by bartering with her neighbors. She trades jewelry for wool, and then a lamp to have it spun. Anna and her mother pick lingonberries together, which they use to dye the yarn red. The bartering continues as the yarn is woven and then tailored into a coat.<br />The story concludes with a Christmas celebration, &quot;the best they had in a long time,&quot; where Anna invites the farmer, the spinner, the weaver, and the tailor to enjoy a Christmas cake together. Anna also takes time to thank the sheep on Christmas Day.<br />Even the candles on the tree in Anita Lobel's cozy illustration remind me of the Christmas trees of my childhood. Whenever I share this inspiring tale with children, I wax nostalgic and tell about the candles on our trees.<br />&quot;A New Coat for Anna&quot; drives home the harsh realities of war and its impact on the daily lives of children... and their neighbors. But it's done in a heartwarming way. Highly recommended.	2000-10-10

This beautifully written and illustrated masterpiece is the perfect &quot;winter&quot; read-aloud for primary level children, especially during those dark, cold post-holiday days of January.<br />&quot;Owl Moon&quot; is an outstanding example of Jane Yolen's fine wordsmithing. This deceptively simple story is crafted from carefully selected words that smoothly roll off the tongue when being read aloud. John Schoenherr's museum quality illustrations ideally complement the text.<br />While one reviewer identifies the child in the story as a boy, and another as a girl, it should be pointed out that the gender of the child is never revealed. This adds a subtly mysterious, yet comforting, appeal to this engaging father/child outdoor adventure.<br />The still, quiet atmosphere of &quot;Owl Moon&quot; is infectious, and has a peaceful, calming effect on young listeners. This is an annual favorite in our school library!	2000-10-10

It is read at the beginning of each school year to first, second and third graders (and they never get tired of it).<br />While it is delightful, spellbinding story, my motives go beyond entertaining the kids. This hilarious tale is an excellent way to discuss proper care of library books. After all, my students don't want to see me, their librarian, turn into a fire-breathing DRAGON!<br />By the time the students reach third grade, I have them begin to look for the puns and plays on words pertaining to fire, heat and smoke. Author/illustrator Carmen Agra Deedy got all &quot;fired up&quot; with her &quot;burning&quot; sense of humor. To introduce the concept of puns, we make comparisons to the Amelia Bedelia books, that they already know and love so well.	2000-10-10

This easy reader chapter book promotes books and reading with an appealing story set in 1905 Maryland. Inquisitive Clara desperately wants to learn to read, but there are no schools nearby, and her father says she's too busy with farmwork to waste her time on books.<br />Levinson makes historical fiction very appealing to younger readers, with a fine eye to the details of rural life, without getting bogged down in old-fashioned terms. While the story is simple, the characters and plot are realistic. In the process, the reader is introduced to the very first &quot;bookmobile,&quot; a horse-drawn wagon, based on historical fact.<br />In our library, this title doesn't get checked out until it is read-aloud or otherwise introduced to the children. After that it gets a lot of use. Recommended.	2000-10-10

This book by Daniel Clendenin exceeded my expectations in its  fairness, and like some other readers, I came away wondering why Clendenin  did not convert. After two and a half years of study, I did. This book is  an excellent introduction to Orthodoxy for readers raised in the Western  tradtion. Highly recommended.	2000-06-23

This is a popular read-aloud book in our elementary school library. Looking at the other reviews one can conclude it would be entertaining and effective from preschool to the corporate world.<br />Rarely does an author  capture the emotions of children (and adults) as succinctly as Kevin Henkes  does here. His playful illustrations of human-like mice carry the story  along and make children want to examine every detail.<br />While entertaining,  &quot;Lilly&quot; teaches some valuable lessons about anger and  forgiveness. Something our society could use a bit more of.	2000-06-14

In our elementary school library, not many non-fiction books make it as successful read-aloud books. This is one of them.<br />Primary age students beg for this title. Both the brightly colored, humorous illistrations and  the light conversational tone of the text grab the interest of the  children. I'm continually amazed at how many facts about chameleons are  slipped into this cheerful picture book, like &quot;they change color when  they're angry, or when they're too cold or too hot, or when they're  sick.&quot;<br />Many pages have additional facts worked into the  illustrations, such as &quot;Chameleons usually get sick and die of kept as  pets.&quot;<br />This book is to be recommended not only as a great  read-aloud, but as a good source of information for students doing a report  on chameleons. It even has a helpful index.	2000-06-13

Primary age students in our school love to have &quot;OfficerBuckle and Gloria&quot; read aloud to them, and upper grade studentsremember this story fondly.<br />While the story stands alone as a playful read-aloud, it can be an effective tool for opening a discussion on safety. Officer Buckle keeps thinking of new safety tips that he keeps thumbtacked to his bulletin board, like &quot;never do tricks on the monkey bars without someone there to catch you.&quot; The endpapers of the book are also filled with stars containing more safety tips.<br />Just as the students in the story are entertained by Gloria, the dog, and come away with Officer Buckle's helpful tips, children who read or listen to this book read will be entertained, yet come away with some great advice, such as &quot;always wear a crash helmet.&quot;<br />This one deserves the Caldecott Medal as the colorful, playful drawings are an essential part of the story.	2000-06-13

Today I got it out to read to a first grade class that incidentally  had heard it yesterday from their classroom teacher. After I offered to  read something else by the same author, they begged me to read Tikki Tikki  Tembo to them again. Students love to chant Tikki's long name each time  they hear it.<br />Whether or not this is an authentic Chinese folktale, it is  a humorous attention-getter that still has a good moral to it. It does  provide an opportunity to point out how Chinese names are usually shorter  than Japanese names, something most kids in our school would not be aware  of.<br />What amazes me is that in this age of fancy graphics students still  are drawn to these simple illustrations.<br />A recommended read-aloud!	2000-05-31

Or do you simply want to re-evaluate the job you currently have? Are you in a position where you have to hire others? Or do you want some guidance  evaluating your personal mission in life?The audio version of this book,  clearly read by the author, is an excellent tool for all of the above  questions, and more. The more I listened, the more I realized that this was  not just a book about job-hunting, but it is also a book about ethics in  the workplace.Find out why the most common job-hunting techniques, such as  reading the want ads and sending out resumes, are among the least effective  methods for landing a job. Find out how to zero in on your own skills and  interests, and with that information use more effective techniques for  landing a &quot;dream job.&quot;In my case, by the time I was done with  this audio book, I realized that the time was not right for change for me,  and that my current job suits my interests and talents quite well.The  epilogue on finding your mission in life, was a suprise bonus that made  listening to the whole book worth it for me!	2000-05-21

Organized alphabecially, like a concordance, usually with a  brief quote on the topic at hand, the reader is referred to one or more  works by Lewis where the subject is covered in more detail. This volume  would be a welcome addition to the collection of any serious reader (or  quoter) of the theological works of Lewis, who introduced many to the  concept of &quot;mere Christianity.&quot;	2000-05-20

It is similar to &quot;My Side of the Mountain,&quot; another award winning book about a boy who survives alone in the woods. The original sequel to  &quot;Hatchet,&quot; called &quot;The River&quot; was disappointing, but  the newer sequel, &quot;Brian's Winter,&quot; is almost as popular as  &quot;Hatchet.&quot; This book grabs the attention of young people,  including kids who normally don't like to read.

When I first read this Russian spiritual classic three years ago, much of the Orthodox terminology was foreign to me. Nevertheless, it whetted my appetite not only for a deeper prayer life, but to find out more about this  spirituality that seems so alien (and eastern) to those of us raised in the  west.<br />Listening to William McNamara read this little gem in my car with  his British accent was like having the pilgrim himself along for a ride  telling me about his wanderings through 19th century Russia in his quest  for &quot;the prayer of the heart.&quot;<br />Three years later, it still  motivates me to a deeper spiritual life. I will continue to re-read or  listen to this classic every few years. I'd recommend giving this  &quot;Pilgrim&quot; a ride, if not a place to stay.	2000-05-11

I walked away  overwhelmed and with an autographed copy of &quot;Dancing Alone&quot; in my  hand. I devoured this book within days, and it set me on a course of  studying the Early Church, re-evaluating the Protestant Reformation, and  eventually &quot;coming home&quot; to the Orthodox Christian Church on  Christmas Eve 1999.<br />Thank you Frank, for speaking out as forcefully as  your blessed dad used to do.

In preparation for her visit, I took a chance and read this delightfully  illustrated (by Steven Kellogg) picture book to every class, Kindergarten  through grade 6. To my delight, I discovered that this modern &quot;tall  tale&quot; had appeal for all ages. Although one review said this book was  overly didactic, I would say that the message that reading is better than  television (or video games, etc.) is one that can't be stressed too much.  And with this title, &quot;a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go  down.&quot;<br />Suzanne Williams did two assemblies for us. For primary  grades she entertained the students with another of her titles, &quot;Mommy  Doesn't Know My Name.&quot; With the older students, she talked about the  writing/publishing process in a manner that kept everyone's attention. I  think Williams' alter ego is &quot;Library Lil!&quot;	2000-03-21

He begged me to get him his own copy! While I am a recent convert to Eastern Orthodox Christianity, I  would've recommended this book to anyone before I knew anything about  Orthodoxy.<br />The chapters all have a ring of truth as they describe the  horrible conditions of the prisoners in Stalin's Siberian camps. The  stories of how Father Arseny, a former art historian turned Russian  Orthodox priest, survived and shared the love of God with his fellow  prisoners, including the Communist official who sent him there, are  humbling and truly awe inspiring.<br />The middle section deals with Father  Arseny's days following his release from prison, but still during the days  of Communist opposition to any underground Christian activity.<br />The final  section introduces the reader to individuals whose lives were incredibly  touched by the ministry and faith of Father Arseny.<br />We in the West need  to learn more about what went on behind the Iron Curtain during the  Bolshevik years. This book puts a human face on the suffering.	1999-12-29
