Kaffe Fassett has done it again.The master of color has 17 wonderful projects for knitting as well as needlepoint and you just can't help but be inspired by this book. The yarns used in this great rainbow of projects are Rowan's, but you can substitute other yarns and achieve your own effects - make it to match your sofa or perhaps your love's green eyes.<br /><br />The photography is by Steve Lovi, who lovingly captures all the nuances and subtle colors in Mr Fassett's work. (Mr Lovi has worked on other books with Mr Fassett.) The \\"Persian Poppy Waistcoat\\" is terrific, the \\"stars and diamonds\\" seiries of sweaters have to be seen to be believed and the needlepoint is out of this world amazing. The instructions are concise and clear.<br /><br />This is not a book for a beginning knitter, but if you're looking to jump start your knitting, maybe make a truly glorious sweater for yourself or a loved one, this book is the place to start. I recommend this book highly.	2005-08-05

The color photograpy is lovely and the projects great.<br /><br />The book starts off with general information about weaving. It explains what a four shaft loom is as well as a table loom. M's Gourlat details how to make a warp and how to figure out for yourself how big a warp you need to make the article. Many patterns are given, but according to M's Gourlat, \\"it is impossible to list all the possible ways of threading the reed.\\"<br /><br />Yarns and their properties are also discussed in this book, so you can plan what type of yarn you need to make your project. The beaded shawl, the first project in the book is a visual delight. There are all sorts of projects - tunics, ponchos, dresses - even a lamp shade.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this book to a brand new weaver, but I think an experienced weaver would get a lot of inspiration from this book. For that reason, I'd recommend it to more experienced weavers.	2005-08-05

But this book is more that a lve letter to teddy bears. It gives all sorts of info about the history of the teddy bear. Sure, you know the basic history of how a man arranged a \\"canned hunt\\" for Theodore Rossevelt, in which a bear cub or a restrained full grown bear (depending on what version you believe) was made available for President Roosevelt to shoot. He refused and the \\"teddy bear\\" was born. There were even children's books about the \\"Roosevelt Bears Teddy B and Teddy G\\".<br /><br />But there's a lot more to teddy bears than that story. THere's the manufacturers, the books. THis book even includes the animated bears such as Yogi Bear and Baloo.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of the books has information about an organization near and dear to my heart - the \\"Good Bears of the World\\" group. This group provides free bears to hospitals, police departments and any other place that the comfort of a teddy is needed - which is almost anywhere in the world.<br /><br />If you love teddies like I love teddies, this is the book for you.	2005-07-09

This book not only tells you about the various plates, it also provides a short history of Denmark.<br /><br />It also includes the legend of the Christmas plates, which I was unfamiliar with - apparently, there was a Christmas custom of wealthy folks giving their servants plates with all sorts of wonderful food on it. The servants, being poor, admired the beauty of the plates and began to hang them on the walls for decorations. Later, the servants of one employer began copmparing their plates with the servants of another employer. The plates started to become more important than the gifts and much work was done to make them more decorative.The plates began to have the year put on them, so the receivers would know exactly which plate was given which year. Thus the custom of the Christmas plate was started.<br /><br />There is much more info in this book - it contains pictures of the plates and the background of the scene depicted on the plate. If you are interested in the Royal Copenhagen Christmas plates, this book will be a great resource for you.	2004-10-18

How amazingly coincidental that I picked &quot;The Curse&quot; when I just started my period for this month.<br />Anyway, it's a good read - I especially like the euphenisms on the endpapers, most of which I never heard of in my life. I grew up in a house with 5 other females, so there were no cute little names for &quot;that time of the month&quot;. As a matter of fact, when I got my first period, I was sick as a dog and my dad said &quot;Now you are a woman&quot; and I told him &quot;If this is what being a woman is all about, you can keep it.&quot;<br />M's Houppert explores the whole feminine hygiene industry, bringing up such bad memories as the &quot;Rely&quot; tampon (remember toxic shock syndrome?) and how dioxin is used in creating the various napkins / tampons most women use at sometime or another.<br />I found this an extremely interesting book. From the extensive quotes from parts of Anne Frank's diaries to the MUM (Museum of Menstruation, located in New Carollton, Maryland and run by Harry Finley, M's Houppert's extensive research makes this book worth a spot on your bookshelf.

M's Simpson writes about her family and life back when tvs were black and white and don't even _think_ about cable.<br />I especially liked her discussion of sex ed during that time period. Apparently, her father was from the same school of philosophy regarding unwed pregnancy - \\"Get in trouble\\" (and we knew that \\"trouble\\" meant being pregnant) \\"and you will die.\\" That was a _very_ effective birth control device at the time.<br />The other part I especially liked was her story about having 2 sons. She talks about getting to know the emergency room folks on a first name basis and I definitely understand that experience.<br />I recommend this book highly - it's like a visit from your funny girlfriend, the one who went to school with you, knew your parents, that one that you only hear from once in a while. It's good to catch up with an old friend and have some laughs.	2004-03-15

For example,at the courthouse in San Francisco performed over 400 marriages (same sex) on February 14, 2004. They normally only perform a little over 400 weddings (opposite sex) a month. This means that many gay couples are committed to each other and want to make it legal in the eyes of the law.<br />This book takes many point of views - some extremists that feel same-sex marriage will ruin their own heterosexual marriages. Lesbians who feel that the idea of marriage is outdated and repressive to the females involved in it. And some folks who seem to have given this issue a bit more thought and express their viewpoints well.<br />No matter where you stand on this important issue, you will find an essay that will reflect your view. I would suggest you also read the other essays to find out how other people feel about the issue so when it comes down to debating this hot topic, you will know the various opinions of your supporters as well as your opponents. You'll be able to state your case in a way that should be able to get your point across. I recommend this book highly.	2004-02-16

It's a funny book but has a lot of truth in it, especially one of my favorite passages: &quot;...stop waiting for some nonexistent guy to come along and save you. Get over it. This is it. Get a job and buy your own stuff.&quot;<br />If you find yourself laughing at that quote or at the least agreeing with it, you will really enjoy this book.

For instance, the term \\"barrel roll\\" means pretty much what it does for PWC as well as flying, except hopefully with flying you won't get all wet. There's also a section on water safety and various resources for this relatively new sport. If you're planning to purchase one of these personal watercrafts and you have a youngester who will be using it, I recommend this book highly.	2004-02-13

People who swear to me they are \\"clean\\" (and I have believed them) have failed. People I'd swear to you weren't clean, passed. I myself had to take repeated urine tests because there was something \\"a little wrong\\" with the results.<br />This book gives you the info about why non-users fail and users pass. For instance, the book statesthe usage of the over the counter eyedrop \\"Visine\\" will produce a false positive for marijuana.  This seems amazing, but Dr Holtorf explains the reactions in clear language so you understand how that situation gives that particular result. This is _NOT_ a \\"how to pass the drug test\\" book, so if that's what you're looking for, you have to look someplace else. But if you are wondering how do the tests determine who's sing and who is not, this is the book for you. I recommend it highly.	2004-02-03

It has the seiries of &quot;I Hate....&quot; poems, which is not collected anywhere else, as well as other gems Dottie deemed not worthy of being republished elsewhere. Mr Silverstein's excellent use of footnotes helps explain what was going on with Dottie when various poems were written. I have always admired Dorothy Parker but I definitely wouldn't want the pain and anguish of her life.<br />So if you are a Dorothy Parker fan, get this book for the lost poems so you can have a full collection of this underrated literay star. I recommend it highly.	2003-12-28

The book is in a question and answer format that may seem a little outdated, with legal abortion, morning after pills and the growing number of never married moms.  But the questions in 1969 are the same as in 2003 - \\"Why do boys say one thng in the dark and something else in the daylight?\\" is a question that has plaqued females since the beginning of time.  And her discussion of the use of condoms is probably one of the most intelligent ones I've ever heard. M's Burn does not talk down to her readers or sugarcoat the truth<br />It's a neat little book, good (if you are a \\"Baby Boomer\\") to show your kids about how sex was handled when you were younger. Of course, it doesn'tcover AIDS or oral sex so you won't get a complete picture of sex in the new millenium. Still, I recommend it highly due to the easy to follow format and the nostalgia value.	2003-09-05

There are a few outdated comments - there are now some yellow african violets and the internet has made swapping leaves a much quicker process.

There are many more options in how to outfit an area for the plants to grow in - mostly due to nore technology and the huge chain hardware stores available. But the basics of plant care does not change, whether it's 1958 or 2003 and this book delivers the basic in a clear concise manner so that it makes it very hard to fail with these beautiful plants.<br />I willwarn you, once you acquire one african violet, you will want more - it's like popcorn, one is not enough. But if you desire to travel down that path, this book is a good companion to help you take care of your plants well. I recommend it highly.<br />*The current most popular blooming houseplant is orchids, but really, the are a _ton_ of trouble and have a relatively short blooming period compared to african violets, which bloom almost continuously.

This book is a marvelous collection of exercises from China that can improve your health. The book starts off with an overview of the history of Chines healing exercises, than goes into who should use these exercises. (Of course, with any exercise program, you should check with your doctor first - that's common sense.)<br />It covers all sorts of health problems, from heart disease to hepatitis as well as hemmorhoids, constipation and colds - they have a massage to prevent the common cold I intend to use this year and see if it works.<br />Most of the exercises have some stretching, massages and breathing exercises which most folks could probably do without overly exerting themselves. That helps make the exercise part much easier. There are also various illustrations thru out the book that help explain the process of the exercise. There are  a few exercises to &quot;cure&quot; insomnia that are extremely helpful to me - cheaper and easier than taking a drug to help bring sleep and you don't have that nasty foggy feeling the next morning.<br />I recommend this book highly, if for nothing else, the insomnia prevention exercises tho the other exercises are good, too. So instead of watching QVC all night or tossing and turning, try this book - I think you will be quite happy you did.	2003-08-27

The book is divided in two sections - real names with their pseudonyms, than the pseudonyms with the real names.  Some history is given as to how certain writers chose their names, but it's mostly &quot;Did Sylvia Plath have a pen name? What the heck was it?&quot;  and you can find it.<br />Pretty cool to have around to settle arguments, if you hang with the type of folks that argue over authors' names or if you're wondering if Jane Somers writes as well as Doris Lessing.

The Latin name, as well as the common name is given so you'll know what to get at the store. If that's not enough help for you, there's lots of glorious color photographs so you can recognize exactly what you're looking for when you see it.<br />Another section of the book deals with the basics of building a glass addition to your house.

M's Hunt gives a history of bread, gives some good tips on bread making and how to fix your mistakes.<br />THen she moves on to the recipes and they are a lot easier than a lot of the bread books out there. She gives a definition of the various ingredients and the measurements, so you know exactly what she means when she says &quot;flour&quot; or sugar.  The illustrations also help you know what is to be done.<br />The recipes are great - I like the sweet dough recipe with the variations (especially the turnovers, yum). The stollen is much easier to create using this book than some of the other books I have on bread making. I easn't too thrilled with the cornbread recipe, but she states up front it is &quot;Yankee or Northern&quot; cornbread and I am used to the other kind.<br />If you'd like to try your hands at baking, this book would be a good place to start.

The book is about interior decorating and not about_ her_ life or_ his_life - though there are some anecdotes. It's not a childrens' book unless you know children who are already into tv shows such as &quot;Trading Spaces&quot; or &quot;While You Were Out&quot;.<br />THat being said, you might wonder what this book _is_ about - it's about Mrs Rodgers designs and dishes for her home. Mrs Rodgers was quite busy in her own right. She had her own interior design company called &quot;Repairs, Inc&quot; and she is also an inventor and holds several patents. So she is not just trading in on her husband's name, she actually knows about this stuff.<br />Mrs Rodgers takes you thru various planning stages of redecorating your home. You see examples from her home as well as some of her friends' homes. She suggests using your own hobbies as focal points for decoration (needlepoint, crochet, gardening, that type of hobby) and shows you how to use these items to blend in with your home.<br />SHe also makes suggestions on entertaining in your home, how the shape of the table influences seating arrangements and gives instructions on how to seat your guests so nobody gets stuck with a bore.<br />There are also quite a few recipes that Mrs ROdgers has served to her guests. Some leave me cold, but that bittersweet icing recipe is well worth the price of admission.<br />If you want to see how the other half live, or maybe you are the other half and want to get some pointers, this is a great book to read - not only for the decorating tips but for the glimpse you get into Richard and Dorothy Rodgers' lives. I recommend this book highly.	2003-07-14

It is printed on what appears to be brown rice paper, which gives it a wonderful feel as well as a great look. There are black ink illustrations and the recipes are printed in red ink - quite a different look for a cookbook.<br />But you're saying, &quot;So it _looks_cool - what about the recipes?&quot; The answer is they are great if you're into Japanese cooking. There's Japanese meatballs (niku dango) that would be very easy to put together from what you probably already have in your kitchen. There is eel bowl (unagi donburi) which you probably don't have all the ingredients on hand. THere is also a wide range of recipes that span the simple to the much more complex and unusual (for Americans) ingredients.<br />The recipes are clear and concise, explaining how to accomplish the recipe. THere's an introduction, explaining various aspects of Japanese cooking and assuring the reader that you don't have to be &quot;The Iron Chef&quot; to cook tasty Japanese foods. You may have to look around to find the right ingredients and spices for some of  these recipes.<br />I recommend this book highly if you want to expand your cooking skills and add new culinary delights to your table.

I realize that most of us probably don't need the knowledge of the last part, but it's still interesting to know these kind of things from the historical perspective.<br />THe book is filled with black and white illustrations, as well as black and white photos detailing ecverything from the simplest (cutting the yarn) to the bargello and trame' stitch.

If you wondered how pretzels came to be made or what Raytheon (yes, the company that makes radio frequency equipment for the Army) had to do with conveinence foods, this is the book for you.<br />Mr Elkort starts off with a brief history of food - beginning with 3000 B.C. (&quot;Beer and Chickens&quot;) to the 1990's (&quot;Conveinence and COnsumerism&quot;). This part explains when various foods came to be consumed by people. I didn't realize the Sumerians were responsible for baking bread as well as brewing beer.<br />THe next part has to do with various cultures of the world and what is eaten there. There is a list of the &quot;usual&quot; breakfasts - I think Portugal has the most appetizing sounding one to me.<br />Another part is a list of different foods and a bit of history of that food.  Other cultures eat eels, rats and mice as well as lungs and other parts that to an American does not sound very good.

If you're intrigued, M's Highcrest has written a book about being a prostitute in Canada. M's Highcrest writes very honestly and openly what it's like to be a prostitute.<br />M's Highcrest started life off as a male. Alex began receiving money for sex while in university, it seemed to him rather harmless at first and being a starving young student, the money came in handy. He did end up getting his degree as a teacher, but never used it. Alex became Alexandra, which she deals in some part in this book and continues to prostitute herself.<br />Contrary to what most seem to think, according to M's Highcrest, most prostitutes are not drug addicted or stupid, they are looking at the economics of prostitution. Certainly a prostitute can make more money in 8 hours of work than most other jobs will pay - definitely the upside to prostitution.  Of course, the downside is no health insurance, no protection under the law, no vacations or sick time. M's Highcrest covers these aspects as well as many others.<br />Mis Highcrest's book is well written, sympathetic, funny and very frank about what her job demands from her. If you are the least bit squeamish about sex, you probably don't want to read this book. But if you want to read a book that strips away the \\"Pretty Woman\\" and Hollywood trappings surrounding prostitution, this is a great read.	2003-06-07

Sandy's desire to be in the Army was so strong he just omitted certain things on his application. He worked very hard but was not chosen to go to Viet Nam - it was felt his reflexes were too slow to respond in that type of environment.<br />If you ever wonder how a woman could survive losing _3_ children and still manage to stay sane, this is a good book for you. It's inspirational and probably not for folks who would object to talk of religion, but it is a good book. I recommend it highly.	2003-06-06

Mr Kramer is a well respected art critic, known for his well trained eye and writing style.<br />So what time period is the &quot;Avant-Garde&quot;? Mr Kramer believes it is the period of time from 1855 to the 1950s. The reviews are divided by time periods, as well as the nationalities of the artists. The reviews are well written and don't have the snobbish point of view that some art critics use, that only the critic can decide what is art.<br />This book helps set different art movements in a historical perspective, so the reader can easily see what else was going on in the art world when the art was produced. The book also contains black and white photos of various art work - it's a shame they couldn't have been done in color. That is my only complaint about this book.<br />I recommend this book highly for old and new artists alike - or even if you're just interested in art - to see how art is put into the historical perspective as well as for the enlightenment the reviews give the reader.	2003-06-03

Or maybe you're meeting friends from more exotic places and want to expand your cooking skills? Maybe some friend you met over the Internet are stopping by and you want to impress them with your knowledge of foreign cusine?  Then this is the book for you!<br />There's recipes from countries from Afghanistan (Ashaks and rice pudding - yum!) to Yugoslavia (Apple cream and Slovenian plum pie - double yum!) and all points inbetween. There are expanded recipes if you're doing a buffet style dinner or having a lot of guests. The recipes are clear and concise plus you won't have to hunt every exotic food store in your city to obtain the ingredients. Some recipes just do not sound too good - the herring salad (from Finland) or the fish souffle (from Iceland)just does not make my mouth water. But there are more than enough recipes to make up for it. Ever had fried green tomatoes? There's a recipe for fried green peppers in this book. Banana pudding, which I thought my mom made up, is in here - from Nepal. there's arecipe for Swedish rye bread which is quite good.<br />So if you're tired of racking your brains for what to cook, this book offers a lot of delicious options. Give it a try!	2003-05-28

It is the true account of the man who inspired Alfred Hitchcock's &quot;Psycho&quot;<br />_and_ Tobe Hooper's &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;. The book is written by the judge of the trial and contains transcripts of the trial.<br />It is a well written book but it is extremely disturbing to realize this was a real person, a man who was regarded as &quot;the quiet type&quot; before his horrible crimes were discovered.<br />If you are interested in true, bizarre crimes, this is an excellent book. My advice is to make sure you have some lighter reading before your bedtime or you could very well have nightmares  from this book. I know I _did_ and I don't consider myself as one who frightens easily. But the sheer catalog of atrocities, done by a real person on real people is truly disturbing.	2003-05-24

This _is_ the A.A.Milne stories with the beautiful Ernest Shepard's illustrations and if you never read this, you are in for a real treat.<br />The illustrations are gorgeous watercolors. The characters have more dimensions to them and the effect is more subtle. You'll recognize some stories from the Disney movies / shows - some you won't. They are great bedtime stories for your little ones and work equally well for adults.<br />If you have little ones in your life, you are going to want this book to read to them or give as a shower gift to an expectant mom. If you want to see what Pooh, Piglet ant the gang are like without all the \\"Disneyfications\\",  this is also a great book. And, if you're like me and have fond memories of this book, it's _definitely_ for you. Read and enjoy:)	2003-05-18

Books	5	0	0	N	N	The proper perspective on &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;	Sure, you've probably seen the movie or had to read the book for a class. But you never really understood what the uproar was about - a relatively simple story, right?<br />This book helps you place the book in the perspective of whrn it was first published and why John Steinbeck's work has survived the test of time.<br />The book is divided into 3 parts - the first part deals with &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; as a social document and the efforts to suppress or censor the book out of existence. The second part, much longer, deals with the book as a work of art and how the various elements in the book work together. The third part of the book offer an assessment of John Steinbeck's career and his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1962.<br />If you want to delve into the classic piece of work known as &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, this book gives you some excellent insight how the world was when this book was first published. I recommend this book highly.	2003-05-09

He prays he won't find anyone punching out early as he did not want to spend his career spying on other employees.<br />From this experience, he begins to build a \\"principle-based\\" work culture, one that cultivates and rewards teamwork. He gives various suggestions on how to make people come together and work as a team instead of being \\"me-opic\\".<br />This is a very good book for managers or folks who want to be managers to learn how to motivate your crew to do the best thing for the greater good of the team. I particularly like how he suggests that working together brings a greater reward for the team than pulling in opposite directions. The suggestions seem sound and based on a real working environment as opposed to some management books use such bizarre examples that you're sure the writer never really worked in an office.<br />By it and cultivate your management skills.	2003-05-09

If you are, than this book is what you're looking for - it is a collection of daylilly recipes from various cookbooks. The range is from such cookbooks as &quot;The Joy of Cooking&quot; as well as &quot;Madame Wu's Art of Chinese Cooking&quot; with stops along the way at &quot;Gourmet Magazine&quot;  and &quot;Sundays at Moosewood Restautant&quot;.<br />There is a diagram of a daylilly with the parts shown. There is also a warning that some people _may_ be allergic to daylillies  and should be careful*. There are recipes for using the tubers and shoots, the blossoms and the buds. there is even deep fried daylily buds with a special blue strawberry dipping sauce. The recipes are clear and concise, though they do call for some more exotic ingredients that you may normally keep in your kitchen. (Saffron or chive flowers, for example.)<br />But if you're looking for something a bit more exotice to cook and you got a yard full of daylillies, this is a great book for you. Just be careful that what you are harvesting is daylillies and not something that might make you very ill.<br />Happy harvesting!<br />*A further warning of great importance is that the daylilly leaves are non-poisonous, they also resemble the leaves of plants that are poisonous such as iris, narcissus and daffodils. And finally, the writer even states that he has to adjust his system to eating daylillies because they cause diarrhea and stomach cramps if he eats them in large quantities. Just a little word to the wise.	2003-05-05

Mrs Weatherman even went door to door in areas where the factories had closed down to talk to the workers.<br />The result is a beautiful labor of love. Catalog reprints, arrangements of glass, print ads and info on the various factories fill this well researched book. Almost anything you can think of (advertising premiums, fish bowls, ashtrays) is in this book.<br />If you are interested in this beautiful glassware, or know somebody who is, this is definitely the book to own.

Yes, that is a style, but not one everybody would like to emulate.<br />This book is terrific - the patterns are lear and concise. When a stitch is referenced, the page that explains how to do the stitch is given. The book is a way of advertising Crochet Guild of America's new yarn line, _BUT_ they also give the description of the yarn and offer other suggestions of brands to use. There is also photos of the featured yarn in the back just in case you have yarn in your stash and you are not sure if it is suitable for the project you picked.<br />I especially liked the section on the crochet hooks. This isn't &quot;oh, here's a size H hook, this shows you various hooks, old as well as new. And there is a conversion chart giving you the European sizes that correspond to the American sizes, a handy reference in and of itself.<br />There's also information on joining the Crochet Guild of America*, which does its best to promote the art of crochet. The benefits and costs are explained completely.<br />I recommend this book highly for all crocheters who would like to make memorable wearables. With the combinations of illustrations and instructions , a relatively new crocheter could still create an eye- catching sweater.<br />*Yes, I am a member, too - but I do not receive any special considerations or kickback for this review - just so you know where I stand on the CGOA.	2003-05-04

For example, &quot;Universal and perpetual peace will reign in the Era of Romic Energy...&quot;. The reasoning seems solid - no reason to fight for fuel, all raw materials could be mined from the ocean and war would be too destructive (all Mr Dietz's reasons). However, as we know, these things did not happen.<br />This book is recommended highly just so the reader can enjoy how the future was supposed to look from the viewpoint of 1945. It certainly is a different view than the current one and, as it says on the back cover, &quot;should be a part of the lirary of every intelligent American.&quot;	2003-05-04

Did you know America's first workable gasoline engine car was built in 1893? I didn't. The Automobile Manufaturers of America do a great job explaining what innovations were brought to car manaufacturing in a time line format. You can look up 1946 and see that Kaiser and Frazer joined in the companies manufacturing passenger cars with their names on the cars. There's also an index of many pioneers that started or worked with cars. Everybody has heard of Henry Ford, but did you know there was a Walter Chrysler or a Louis Chevrolet? There's also an alphabetical list of when various cars were manufactured.<br />That's what makes the book so interesting - there are some cars you may have heard of, and some cars, unless you've really involved with cars, you wouldn't know.<br />For you or the car buff in your life, this is the book for you.	2003-04-26

Some of the famous, such as Bobby Seale, as well as the not so famous, Captain Levy, trials are explored in this book. The writers, also, vary from the now famous to the not currently famous.<br />These essays explore what was at stake in the various trials and what it meant for the future of America.<br />The essay about Bobby Seale is probably the best known trial out of the group selected. It is also illustrated with drawings by Jules Feiffer. But it doesn't make the other essays less compelling, I found the essay on Captain Levy quite toucing, sort of an American Dr Zhivago - but not as wonderful as portrayed on the screen.<br />Take a dip into the late 60's when ploitical activism bloomed.

And your trip to the thrift shop yields 10 books, all of them selling for a penny.<br />Mr Windwalker covers a lot of basics in this book - some say the book is too basic but I don't think so. You have to know the nitty-gritty of what you're getting into before you decide to take a huge plunge. He doesn't recommend specific books, but recommends books that have worked for him. He recommends possible book buying sites. Some of the stuff seems common sense, but I never thought of things quite that way.<br />So if you are planning to become an ongoing online bookseller - meaning you will probably be selling more books than your own weeding out from your personal library - I recommend this book highly.

This book discusses some of these aspects of Hollywood life as well as the various films regarding homosexuality.<br />There's some films I never thought had anything to do with homosexuality - for instance, the Rita Hayworth film \\"Gilda\\". I never realized the male leads played the part as if they were gay lovers. It makes total sense once it's pointed out, but I have to admit I didn't see that aspect before.<br />Much information is provided regarding various actors' sexual preferences, even detailing Judy Garland's unfortunate picks of husbands (one was having an affair with Liza's husband - that's something for Jerry Springer!).<br />Most of the information is not sensationalized, however, and makes for a very good read. Much of Hollywood's past, a homosexual was forced to marry to cover up his/her sexuality. Careers would (and did) crumble if a whiff of homosexuality surrounded a star. The people who had to deal with living this lie are names and discussed, but not in a \\"National Enquirer\\" way. Their personal lives as well as their professional lives are skillfully interwoven to give you a complete picture of the person. Mr Braun treats his subjects with the respect they deserve.<br />If you want to see how much gays and lesbians influenced the movies, this book is a great place to start. I never realized there were so many actors and actresses that were in the closet and I never realized so many films had a gay subtext. I will be looking at the movies a little differently now, thanks to Mr Braun.	2003-03-11

A great book to start out with if you're just getting to know poetry, it features many &quot;name&quot; poets such as Robert Frost, Dorothy Parker and Wiliam Carlos Williams as well as some not so famous names such as Paul Dehn, Jeanne McGahey and John Ciardi. If you are a long time poetry fan, this book will add small gems to your collection that would be exceedingly difficult to track down.<br />All the poems have something of value to offer to the reader and th ebook is organized in a stream of consciousnees flow - one section starts off with &quot;Steam Shovel&quot; (Charles Malam), wanders thru&quot;The Toaster&quot;, &quot;On Watching The Construction Of A Skyscraper&quot;, meaders throught &quot;Apartment House&quot; and settles on &quot;The Builders&quot;.

Why would you need a book about doing housework? And just how can a book called &quot;Superwoman&quot; help you tame the housework monster?** Does the author expect you to be able to handle housework, a job, kids and all that?<br />Not without her help, she doesn't. And M's Conran covers many bases - a shopping list, cleaning tips, clothes maintenance. Some is a little dated (the microwave section, since this was published in 1979) but by and large, it's a marvelous help to decide whether you should sweep or dust first, how to find out in cantalopes are fresh and exactly what type of maintenance your house needs is not going to change much in the last almost 25 years. The instructions on buying food is definitely worth the price of admission. And M's Conran makes it a fun, enjoyable readwhich is good because housework generally isn't that much fun.<br />I recommend this book to all people just starting out so you will have a reference book to help figure budgets, the best appliances and all that other stuff that comes from being on your own for the first time.

The sp;endid documentation of this book helps bolster your spirit when you or a loved one has been diagnosed with cancer. How does a complete remission happen? Special herbs? Chemo? Or is it all just a hoax?<br />The authors do note that a majority of the folks that have a spontaneous remission have had an acute infection with a fever prior to the remission, The theory is that the antibodies are just working \\"overtime\\" as it were, to defeat the tumor as well as the infection. This news is not particularly soothing however. Chemotherapy and radiation decreases the body's immune system, so high fever or an acute infection would be treated very aggressively in a cancer patient.<br />The authors also believe that spontaneous remissions are decreasing in frequency. They feel that this is in part to the use of antibiotics. Again, if a high fever would start the immune system into overdrive, an antibiotic would prevent that action.<br />There is much to be learned about spontaneous remission and this book is a very good place to start. It's well researched and documented and you don't need to be a M.D. or an oncology nurse to understand the information that is presented. I recommend this book highly for those of you interested in spontaneous remission case studies.	2003-02-18

Not because Morton Mintz has not thoroughly researched and documented all his information. And not because the book is difficult to read or poorly written. This book is frightening because it concerns prescribed drugs many of us take on a daily basis.<br />Mr Mintz was the reporter who won the Raymond Clapper Award for breaking the story about the sedative thalidomide. This drug caused phocemelia (literally, seal flippers)in babies* whose mothers took it while pregnant with them. Because of thalidomide, a law was passed that gave the FDA the power to require specific procedures be followed in test new drugs for safety and effectiveness.<br />Mr Mintz discusses many classes of drugs - oral contraceptives, diuretics, antidepressants and antibiotics being just a few of the many discussed. Some are drugs that not currently used, but much more are still in routine usage. Mr Mintz gives frightening statistics of how these drugs do not work and what the side effects are for the various classes of drugs. It is especially scary to read the side effect of a drug that you took and realize all the things that could have go horribly wrong with the body's reaction to the drug.<br />Though this book is not an easy read nor is it the \\"feel good\\" book of the year, I recommend this book to anyone in the health care field to learn more about the drugs being administered. I also recommend this to the layperson who wonders why the FDA system is slower now to approve new drugs. It is an incredible read.<br />Thalidomide was _never_ prescribed in the U.S, at that time period, though 17 babies were born with phocemelia because free samples from Merrell were distributed by physicians, as was allowed at the time when Merrell filed to sell thalidomide in the United States.	2003-02-18

I like this seiries of books but was not real happy with this particular one. The recipes, as always, are terrific, but the dynamics between Arch and Goldy makes me want to point somebody in the direction of family counseling.<br />The plot of the story is that it appears that Goldy's abusive exhusband has murdered his current girlfriend. Arch, her son, gets angry because he feeld Goldy and Tom don't want to help the &quot;Jerk&quot;. This seems a bit difficult to swallow because I would have thought Arch would have seen the after effects of Goldy's abuse - the broken thumb, the black eyes, the bruises. You can't hide something like that from a child, they can tell something is going on. So that the &quot;Jerk&quot; would ba a good non-abusive father yet a horrible abusive husband doesn't seem to work for me. Nor does Arch's anger at his mother for what her perceives as her failure to try to clear his father's name.<br />If you're working thru the complete seiries (as I am), you will have to make this stop. I don't think you'll enjoy it as much as the other books, but the recipes may make up for it.	2003-02-15

In this book, she aggressively takes more risks with herself as well as her son and that seemed to be out of place for her character.<br />No matter - the recipes, as always were great but there seemed to be a plot piece missing in this particular book. If you're interested in the seiries, this is not the book to start off with. Some reocmmend reading the books in chronological order and I'd have to agree with that point. I read them out of order. Some events in past books are referred to in the later books and unless you read them, it doesn't make sense to you.<br />This is a good read, not as good as the others, but the recipes are fantastic.

Anderson and Judith P. Zinsser) to write. M's Anderson taught at Brooklyn College. M's Zinsser taught at Bryn Mawr College. Their ten years of work was very well spent in producing this detailed history book.<br />If you read most history books, you'll notice very little is mentioned about what the women were doing at that particular point in time. What was it like to be a noblewoman and have your husband go off to war? What was the daily activity for a peasant's wife? What was labor and childbirth like for women of those times? Was there a Renaissance for women? Did the spread of Christianity hurt or help women?<br />M's Anderson and M's Zinsser answer these questions and so much more in this well researched book. They detail the archaeological evidence that supports their writing, as well as various written works that provide a glimpse into women's lives hundreds of years ago. There are various pictures of artifacts, as well as artwork depicting women through out the years.<br />There are many things I never thought about in regards to being a woman in the past.  The fact that female children, for example, were breastfed for only a year while their brothers nursed for two years (thereby affording more protection against diseases)  seems especially disheartening. The information about the noblewoman's life seems particularly sad in this day and age. Basically a daughter was used as property by her parents who wanted her to &quot;marry well&quot; - perhaps to form an alliance with a more powerful noble's family or to gain land. Some parents even went as far to beat their daughters into their marriages. Their life didn't become easier once they got married. The noblewoman would have to arrange for moving to different estates, supervise the staff and the laborers, figure out the taxes and the annual income among other tasks.Not exactly how it's portrayed in movies or books, is it?<br />This is a book to read and ponder. All the aspects of a woman's life is covered in this compelling book - childbirth, contraception, religious practices are just some of the subjects this well organized book describes. M's Anderson and M's Zinsser makes the past come alive with their writing style.

Salinger. Mr Salinger did not so-operate with this author and has refused publicity at all times. When &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; came out in 1951, Mr Saliner escaped publicity by traveling to Europe.<br />Mr Lundquist pieces together what is known about Mr Salinger's life along with his stories (&quot;Franny and Zooey&quot;, &quot;A Perfect Day for Bananafish&quot; among them) as well as Salinger's only novel &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;. You learn about Mr Salinger's part in the D-Day invasion, his correspondence with Ernest Hemingway and how often suicide or suicidal tendencies come up in his work.<br />I didn't know that Mr Salinger used his own experience at prep school in Holden Caulfield's life. Mr Lundquist also shows how Mr Salinger's religious beliefs, particularly about Zen Buddhism, underscore all his writing.<br />This is a very interesting book about J.D. Salinger, as it examines his life through his work and not just the typical &quot;he was born on such and such a date, married So &amp; So and had 3 kids..&quot;.  I won't claim I understand the man or his writings completely, but it definitely does give you insight into his personality. I recommend this book highly if you want to know more about the reclusive writer of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;.	2003-02-02

In this book, the action takes place in Kyoto, the ancient capital of Japan. Since M's Whitney lived in Japan until she was fifteen years old, she has a different view than the average tourist.<br />The premise is two young teenagers, Celia and Stephen Bronson, visit their grandmother in Kyoto. Sounds relatively simple, right? But at the grandmother's house, in the garden in fact, appears to be the ghost of a samurai. One of the neighbors, Gentaro Sato, believes it is his ancestor trying to contact him.<br />Gentaro Sato, a distiguished Japanese artist, is also very hostile to the new American neighbors. He is not happy that his granddaughter Sumiko spends so much time with Celia and wants Sumiko to conform to Japanese tradition.<br />This book is much more than a mystery - it shows you how people of various backgrounds can come together and become friends. It tells you of various cultures and the spiritual beliefs that exist in these cultures. The book makes it easy to learn of Japanese culture by incorporating it into the flow of the story.<br />I recommend this book highly for anyone who likes a good mystery with a little history thrown in with it.	2003-01-30

Fred Muggs?	&quot;The Today Show&quot; started in 1952 as a gamble to fill morning television hours.  The show got horrible reviews and yet it's still on television 51 years later. How in the world did that happen?<br />This book details the beginning of &quot;The Today Show&quot;, starting with the first host, Dave Garroway. The man who is considered the father of the show, Pat Weaver is profiled here. All the information about how the show was put together, the various hosts of the first twenty-five years and all the growing pains of a long running television news show are detailed in this book.<br />If you want to see what &quot;The Today Show&quot; was like in the beginning, this is the book for you.	2003-01-29

Just so you know, Jane van Lawick-Goodall is more commonly known as Jane Goodall - yes, the one that works with chimpazees. Hugo van Lawick-Goodall was the photographer as well as her husband during the chimpazee studies.<br />This book manages to make 3 animals that most folks do not have a lot of love for and make them interesting reading. I don't particularly like hyenas and the description of how they eat their prey alive is unnerving but it is also fascinating. Hyenas (as well as jackals and wild dogs) kill their prey with a method known as rapid disembowelment. The prey dies very quickly as opposed to the methods lions (as well as cheetahs and leopards) use which is suffocation. Suffocation can take at least ten minutes if not longer to kill the prey. I won't presume to know which is the most painful way, but rapid disembowelment would seem more efficent from the predator's point of view.<br />They spend over two years studying spotted hyenas, golden jackals and wild dogs. The information about the social structure the animals participate in as well as their hunting methods are described in great detail. You don't have to be a zoologist or have specialized training to appreciate this book, but I think being an animal lover would be a great help.<br />One of the more interesting parts to me was when M's van Lawick-Goodall talks about taking her baby son along on this expedition. She details how she tried to make it as safe as possible for Grublin and how he grew up with the animals.<br />The black and white photographs are excellent. The bat eared foxes are quite photogenic, as well as the cheetah cubs at play.The pictures of the books subjects are equally good.<br /><br />M's van Lawick-Goodall does an excellent great job giving the reader a different viewpoint of these much maligned animals. Read the book and learn all about these \\"innocent killers\\".	2003-01-29

Isaac Asimov provides the introduction and also is the editor of this volume of wonderful stories.<br />There are eight stories, written by various writes such as Anne McCaffrey and Cordwainer Smith. The titles are also as intriguing as the writers - \\"Flight Over XP-637\\" and \\"The Anglers of Arz\\".<br />\\"The Smallest Dragonboy\\" by Ann McCaffrey details the rite of passage on the world of Pern. A young man cannot become a warrior until he is chosen by one of the telepathic dragons. The story details the struggles of Keevan to be chosen by a dragon hatchling and to become a warrior.<br />\\"The Botticelli Horror\\" by Lloyd Biggle,Jr reads like a 1950s sci fi movie. It involves a visitor from Venus that also lives in a sideshow. The Venusian visitor happens to paint in a manner similiar to Botticelli. This sounds rather nice to have an alien that could create those kinds of pictures but of course there's always a slight problem with aliens in sideshows.<br />\\"Kid Cardula\\" by Jack Ritchie is about a young man who wants to train as a boxer. Well, maybe he's not such a young man though he claims to be blue blooded - he is very strong and does suffer from photophobia. He requests all his matches to be scheduled at night due to his fear of sunlight. His favorite color is black, he has two long upper teeth and he gets spooked when another fighter makes the sign of the cross before a fight begins. Wonder what type of fantastic creature fits that description? I'm sure you can guess but the story is very entertaining.<br />\\"The Man From P.I.G.\\" by Harry Harrison is also about visitors froma another planet. There appears to be nothing but pigs on the spaceship - except for the pig farmer. The pig farmer sets up in an area where \\"we're a little short of meat animals and the sight of all that fresh pork on the hoof..\\". But of course, these pigs aren't for eating purposes. And the pig farmer - he's not an ordinary pig farmer, either.<br />\\"Flight Over XP-637\\" by Craig Sayre is about alien scientists observing life on earth. An accident occurs to one of the scientists that has transformed to live on Earth. The story reconstructs the accident and gives you much more insight into the aliens.<br />\\"The Bees From Borneo\\" by Will H. Gray is about the best beekeeper and queen breeder in the United States. Through genetic engineering, Silas Donaghy's bees manage to surpass all other bees for production of honey. All goes well until a wild queen bee is introduced into the hives of Silas Donaghy's bees.<br />\\"The Anglers of Arz\\" by Roger Dee is about about scientists traveling to a strange land and investigating it. In that respect, it sounds similiar to \\"Flight Over XP-637\\" but the similarities end at that point. The scientists are from Earth and are exploring Arz, a strange world with an underwater city.<br />\\"The Game of Rat and Dragon\\" by Cordwainer Smith is about telepathic cats and humans working together to destroy a common enemy - to the humans, the enemy appears as a dragon. To the cats, the enemy appears as a rat. This partnership works for the benefit of both animals but causes some problems along the way.<br />All the stories are very well written and intriguing. I advise you to get this book and expand your mind as to what types of creatures may exist in the world.

I woke up to be sure I caught the news before I went to school - and there, another horrible scene was being played out. It seems unreal to me even now, after all these years.<br />This book is basically an oral history that tells two stories - the one is the thoughts and feelings of the folks on the train and gathered to see it, the other story is of Mr Kennedy's life and the impact his life had on the world.<br />It's broken down into various sections - his career as attorney general, working with Senator McCarthy, friends and family memories, the Cuban missile crisis - so you get a fuller picture of what Robert Kennedy was like in real life. It makes the tragedy of his death all the more poignant to learn about these things.<br />If you want to learn more about Robert Kennedy and how he was viewed in the time period he lived and dies in, this book is a very good place to start and I recommend it highly.	2003-01-24

At an age when most boys (of this era) are trying to figure out what video game to play next, Charlemagne was leading his first military expedition. The book starts off with Charles, son of Pepin the Short, being all of 11 years old and starting off with Charles being named the &quot;noble son&quot; of the king.<br />You learn of his background - he was the son of a favored mistress who married the king - a few years after Charles was born. His younger brother, born after the wedding, was the favorite of his father and Charles was somewhat jealous of that situation.<br />The book takes you through all the times of Charles the Great, the one they called Charlemagne - he conquered _all_ of Europe, from the Pyrenees to Constantinople,He established schools and laws that persist to this day. He was considered the absolute monarch of the Christian world. This book takes you every step of the way with him, through his military campaigns as well as his life with his family.<br />This book is a wonderful read and I recommend it highly for those of you who are interested in history.	2003-01-23

M's Lucas was the first famous television cook, having her own show on CBS in 1949. She was a star student at the Cordon Bleu in the 1930s. She also did something else interesting in the 1930s - she was a hotel chef in Hamburg where she was often called upon to fix Adolph Hitler's favorite meal - stuffed squab*.<br />Along with Rosemary Hume, she founded Le Cordon Bleu in London. In 1942, with the blitz going on in London, she came to New York with her two young sons. (Rosemary Hume kept the school in London going even during the blitz.) There she taught adults as well as children the various intricacies of cooking in the Cordon Bleu way.<br />So what does all that have to do with this brillant book? In 1980, this book received the Hall of Fame Award by the James Beard Foundation. This book was written at a different time, when butter and cream were generously used and enjoyed. Most of us don't eat like that everyday but this book is great for feast day celebrations (birthdays, anniversaries or when you want to make something a little different.)<br />There is \\"Filet of Sole Veronique\\" with peeled white grapes. Yes, a time consuming dish to make but well worth the effort - and it is impressive. The \\"Potage Sange\\"is exquisite and light years away from what Campbell Soup company sells as potato soup.<br />The chocolate jelly roll cake is widely reguarded as the best dessert in this book, but I beg to differ - the lemon meringue pie is terrific. And of course, chocolate mousse - but none of the recipes are \\"bad\\" - I don't like the \\"crepes Suzette\\" but I just don't like them, irregardless of who makes them or who wrote the recipe.<br />If you want to make something more special, perhaps a special dinner or dessert for a loved one or yourself, this is a great addition to your cooking library. the instructions are clear and the ingredients are relatively easy to obtain.

Tammie does not take well to being left out of the family's adventures, so he tags along whenever possible. The illustrations are quite charming, with Tammie winning your heart when he looks sad at being sent back home. This book was first published in 1935, so that age is preserved in the illustrations.<br />This is a good read along book, especially the tag line which children will come to expect. It's a warm comforting story from another time when the world seemed much smaller and gentler. I advise this book for anyone who likes Scotty dogs (and _who_ doesn't?) or those with children still young enough to want a bedtime story read by an adult.	2003-01-19

The handmade objects alone are worth getting this book for, but the stories are detailed and make this a well-rounded book.<br />If you missed the exhibition \\"The Grand Generation: Memory, Mastery, Legacy\\", this book will give you a chance to experience it.

Mr De Quincey regarded himself as \\"the Pope\\" of the poppy and his work reflects the dreams he had while under the influence of opium.<br />When the book first came out (1822), some reviewers thought it was Coleridge's work - Mr De Quincey had to prove he indeed wrote it. Despite the use of the word \\"Confessions\\" in th etitle, Mr De Quincey does not seem repentant or remorseful regarding his use of opium. In fact, Mr De Quincey believed that the use of opium released the \\"majestic intellect\\" of a person's mind, similiar to Dr Timothy Leary's view on LSD.<br />Those of you who are interested in pharmacology or drug addiction would be well served by reading this book. Mr De Quincey felt that his opium eating was actually beneficial to him and judging by his articulate arguments, one wonders is he could have been right.<br />Read it for yourself and see how this type of thing was handled in the nineteeth century.	2003-01-19

My sons would eat pizza evey day, probably all day if they could get away with it. Delivery pizza, depending upon your area, can be expensive and some aren't very good. Or suppose you'd rather have deep dish pizza? This is the book for you!<br />Mr Food (Art Ginsburg) has over a hundred recipes for various pizzas - some you don't even have to use yeast for the recipe. And all the recipes have instructions that are clear and concise, making sure you know every step of the way what you are doing.<br />My all time favorite recipe in this book is the deep dish pizza recipe. I toss the stuff in the bread machine and let the machine do the work up to the baking part. Sometimes I add extra garlic or Parmesan cheese or even Italian sausage. Sometimes I use the recipe to actually make deep dish pizza. Often I use it to make our favorite breadsticks and it is just wonderful to use either way.<br />And if you're not a deep dish fan? Don't worry, there's lots of other recipes for you to try and enjoy. And it sure is a lot less expensive that calling out for pizza - in the time it takes you to whip up one of these recipes, the pizza guy will just be getting lost on his way to your place.

Not only that, she is a talented knit and crochet designer.<br />This book shakes up the notion of what crocheted items look like - yes, we crocheters know it isn't all those granny square pochos in forest green and harvest gold, but the world doesn't know that yet. M's Chin's designs for afghans and wearables are very interesting and look quite elegant.<br />This is not, however, for raw beginners although the instructions are clear and precise. This is for crocheters who want to stretch their talent in a different way and do not have to worry about exactly how the stitches turn out. This is a good book for somebody who has some experience crocheting so they can see what is possible to do with the art of crochet.<br />Crochet has never gotten the respect knitting gets and I believe this items in this book will help people see crocheting in a new way. So until that day, nake an item (or three) from this book and be prepared to explain \\"No, it's crocheted\\" to the unknowing.

She doesn't feel the need to make herself look good at someone else's expense. <br />It's amazing that a woman that was told she was ugly, who was definitely not encouraged to go into dance, managed to become one of the great, most memorable choreographers (&quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;Brigadoon&quot; and &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; among many others) of all time. It's especially astouding to realize she did this without any help or encouragement from her famous uncle, Cecil de Mille or her father William de Mille (who was a successful playwright). <br />Read this book and find out how M's de Mille makes the long journey from a being a fired choreographer in New York to winning two Tony awards. You'll be glad to be along for this trip.	2003-01-12

This book is great for starting a party or an argument, writing up silly tests to send over the internet to your friends and winning items from radio shows. Radio shows in my area tend to ask questions such as &quot;What is gephyrophobia?&quot; so the listener can call in and win a prize. Sometimes the folks make up the answers (&quot;Fear of a geography test?&quot;) but it's easy to win when you can look on page 83 and see it means &quot;fear of crossing bridges&quot;.<br />This book is also helpful while playing Scrabble, especially if you play with a person who tends to come up with unusual words - if it's not in the Oxford and it's not in this book, it doesn't count for points in Scrabble.<br />So buy this book and entertain your friends, torment your co-workers and tease your fellow Scrabble players with bits of information gleaned from this excellent reference book.

Want to see a picture of a naked (young) Peter Fonda?<br />Now that I got your attention, let's go to the matter of this wonderful book. It's a large &quot;coffee table&quot; type of book, all the pictures are in balck and white - even the wonderful close-up of Liz Taylor in &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot; and it is quite marvelous to look through.<br />The book starts off the invention of the &quot;moving pictures&quot; by Edison with the help of his assistant Dickson. It moves from Penny Arcades or Peep Shows (didn't the meaning of that phrase change over the years?) on to kinetoscopeand George Melies. There are scenes from everything from &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; as well as &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; with many stops inbetween.<br />There are stills from  films of the Nickelodeon age - &quot;Gertie the Dinosaur&quot;. one of the first animated films, as well as &quot;The Fighting Roosevelts&quot;. There are the reports of the public reaction to &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot; and Griffith's answer to such reports. I was amazed to learn that Harold LLoyd's &quot;human fly&quot; stunt (in &quot;Safety Last&quot;, a great film if you can find it) was done with no trick photography, no stunt doubles and onaly a net netween the star of the movie and the street below. That makes that scene seem totally different when you know there wasn't much room to make a mistake.<br />Of course, the book has many stills of the movies of the Marx Brothers, postwar musicals as well as features on such stars as Eliazabeth Taylor, Sidney Portier and Marilyn Monroe. Various movie styles are featured with stills of the more famous (and not so famous) actors of that type. It is basically a visual encyclopedia of film history.<br />If you like older movies and want the information on how various effects were accomplished or you want to see pictures of Joan Crawford from various stages of her career, this is the book for you. You can use it as a reference or just look through it on those days and nights when there seems to be nothing good on tv or at the movies. Find it and enjoy it.career, this is the book for you.

Books	5	56	59	N	N	Good instruction book but .....	I like this book and the way M's Righetti writes about crochet and her love of the craft. The instructions are generally good but the diagrams leave a lot to be desired. They are difficult (to me) to understand and I wouldn't choose this as a first crochet book for anyone wanting to learn to crochet.<br />Part of the reason for my opinion is that M's Righetti has a very strict view on how a crochet hook is supposed to be held. There is more than one way to hold a crochet hook and a person should be able to hold the hook comfortably in her/his hand. M's Righetti's recommendation of how to hold the hook makes my wrist sore and I have a great deal of difficulty crocheting in that position. I have been crocheting now for over 30 years and I get good results by holding the hook the way it comfortably fits my hand.<br />Outside of her reprimands/criticisms of the &quot;proper&quot; way to hold the hook and the difficult to understand diagrams, this is a good book and I recommend it highly for folks who already know a little about crocheting and want to learn more. Stitches are explained well and her instructions on cutting a piece of crocheted work is definitely liberating. So buy the book and expand your knowledge of one of the greatest needle arts, crochet.	2003-01-11

This review is about the _second_ edition of the book, which apparently is totally different than the first edition.<br />I thought this was a great book for the history as well as the recipes. The first part of the book is various celebrities saying what kind of bagels they like - interesting, but not compelling.<br />Then there are about 15 pages of bagel recipes - yes,_bagel_ recipes such as a basic one, blueberry (of course) and a Valentine's Day bagel, among other recipes. There's info on why a bagel is better than a doughnut for you (but you knew that already, didn't you?). The rest of the book is recipes for bagel toppings and things such as bagel stuffing.<br />I wonder if I read the same book (again, I'm talking about the second edition) simply because there are recipes to make bagels and there's about 13 pages of vegetarian spreads, despite what another reviewer stated. There's stir fried bagels, garlic bagels, butterscotch bagels as well as my kids' favorite, pizza bagels.<br />The spreads are amazing - the strawberry cheese bagel is much better than the soft spread Philadelphia Brand sells. The bagel cheese pastries are terrific. I recommend this book highly as it expands your horizons in regards to what you put on a bagel. I was always a cinnamon raisin with plain cream cheese kind of person, but that mushroom spread on an garlic bagel is heavenly.<br />Buy the book and enjoy bagels.	2003-01-11

How you can do experiments with your own &quot;blind spots&quot; and watch how your brain supplies the missing information. It explains how different traumas affect the brain and the outcomes of this trauma.<br />But it's told in an engaging humorous way, on a personal level by somebody who is absolutely fascinated by what he (and she) find out about the workings of the brain. You don't have to sit with the medical dictionary by your side, pausing every few sentences to look up a term. Medical terms are explained in laymen's language so you always know exactly what is being discussed.<br />But it's not an easily absorbed book. It makes you think about how psychology and physical trauma to the brain are interrelated.<br />It may, depending on your own history, make you nod in recognition at various diagnosis. You won't want to read this all in one setting because you will need time to process the information.<br />But if you're interested in how the brain works, if you're willing to stretch your reading a bit, this is a great book to read. I recommend it highly.	2003-01-09

And heaven knows there are plenty of movies about that time period - and who has the time to read a 639 page book about stuff you already know?<br />Make the time to read this book - you won't realize how fast the time goes while you reading about one of the most famous love triangles of all and getting an education about swords, armor and knights at the same time. Guinevere is not some heartless flirt, she genuinely loves Lancelot and Arthur. Lancelot fights hard to hide his feelings for Guinevere as he loves Arthur, too. Arthur loves them both. This set-up alone would make for an intriguing story, but set it against the background of politics, castles and quests it's truly a fascinating read.<br />The book is not just about the love triangle, though &quot;Camelot&quot; would have you believe it. Arthur works hard to civilize the people he rules and succeeds to a large extent. There are various quests that must be made - the Holy Grail, for example. Arthur strives long and hard to make his kingdom a civilized one.<br />He succeeds, to a certain extent, but the dark cloud on the horizon looms and it's ....<br />Read the book yourself and find out what happens - trust me, you'll really enjoy this book.	2003-01-07

I waited (not so patiently) for the rest of the set to come out and was richly rewarded for my patience.<br />The first book sets the stage for the next three and introduces the characters of Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin> Meg's father was working for the government and has been gone quite some time, leaving Meg and her family alone. Meg's mom keeps the home fires burning, but never lets on to the children her fears. Charles Wallace was just a baby when his father left, now he's in school. And then there's Meg - not cool like the other girls, not beautiful, too outspoken and smart to fit in her class, she worries that her father has died. Throw Calvin, a sort of popular boy from school into this mix and you got the makings of an adventure. (The twins show up in this book, but later they are showcased more.)<br />Meg and company set out ot find her father, which turns out to be a lot harder than it looks - and it looks pretty darn hard!<br />The other books continue the adventures of this group, as the characters age and other things come along to upset their world.<br />The books are set up as a classic good versus evil, but it never feels preachy or didactic and you will be swept away in the current of the stories. I highly recommend this for girls as it shows a protagonist who isn't cool or popular and how she handles things - not so well at times. My sons loved it, too so I know other boys would like it. I reread it every few years as it seems there's something in there I need to read again or I learn something different. Obviously, in the beginning, I identified more with Meg, but now I see the parents' point of view, too.<br />Buy this set for yourself or for somebody who needs to be a little challenged on their reading and thinking and enjoy it.	2003-01-03

I think that's why this book is in many ways superior to the Nancy Mitford book.<br />Edna St Vincent Millay was not only a great person of words, but a great seductress and everyone, male and female alike, fell under her spell. Apparently, accordingly to this book, she managed to live up to their expectations quite well. Mr Epstein matches the love poems to the folks they were written for and gives the details of the various affairs. It may not sound interesting, but it is quite interesting - especially since M's Millay seemed to have a weakness for men who were not quite as talented as she was. The background behind &quot;Fatal Interview&quot; and the story of her (apparently) one love she lost before_she_ was ready to is quite an interesting read by itself.<br />Mr Epstein focuses on M's Millay as sort of a self made goddess and how her various affairs shaped her writing. M's Mitford focuses on how M's Millay's relationship with her mother shaped her life. Both of these are very interesting and I'd advise reading them consecutively and draw your own conclusions. In some respects, I think Mr Epstein is correct in what he presumes, but the same can be said of M's Mitford.<br />Throw yourself into the words and life of Edna St Vincent Millay - you'll find yourself awash with her beautiful poetry and prose and this book will help you make sense out of it.	2002-12-31

One reason is the wonderful photographs and the clear consise instructions that come with the projects. Another reason is because it shows crochet being fashionable and easy to make as opposed to being something &quot;old fashioned&quot; looking.<br />When my youngest neice asked for a crochet book as a gift, this is the book I picked to give her. It has good instructions for beginning crocheters (which she is) and has enough innovative patterns to keep her interested past the initial frustration of learning a new craft. This is a high compliment from me because I've been crocheting over 30 years and have seen many crochet books and I thought this one was the best for a young woman just starting to crochet. (I may have chosen the Lily Chin one, but it wasn't out at that time.)<br />I recommend this book highly to anybody who wants to expand their crochet skills. The projects are beautiful and instructions are clear. (No, I _didn't_ see the &quot;mistake&quot; on page 156. I'm wondering if the other reviewer may have misread the instructions.)

Crochetrs complain kniiters get all the good patterns and while that may seem true, it isn't in this book. You have to have the necessary perserverance to see the item come to fruition and it's not easy to do that. Even if you don't follow the patterns exactly or just use the book as a springboard for your own items, you'll really see the use of it.<br />But if you see it thru, your rewards will be great - and when somebody asks, \\"Oh did you knit that?\\" you can say proudly \\"No, I _crocheted_it.\\"<br />And when they say \\"Oh, can you make me one, too?\\" - well that's for you to decide.	2002-12-22

Perhaps her work is regarded as too &quot;light weight&quot; or perhaps structure and an ear for how a poem sounds is not as important as it once was - I don't know. But I recommend this book to help correct the lack of Edna St. Vincent Millay's poetry.<br />I think that Edna St. Vincent Millay is one of the best poets ever, male or female, of any time period. So of course it would follow that I think this book is great, too.<br />Treat your senses to her wonderful lyrics and you will see what I mean. The sonnet form is a strict one, one that few poets master yet M's Millay makes it work so wonderfully for her.<br />There are love sonnets, of course - but there are just as many that have nothing to do with love. All of these sonnets are great, of course I have my favorites - read throught the book and you'll probably have your own picks, too.	2002-12-22

Did she really marry a homosexual man twice? What really was the relationship between Dorthy and Robert Benchley? Was she a Communist? And is Lillian Hellman as wonderful as M's Hellman makes herself out to be? These questions (and of course much more) are answered by this book.<br />You may think you know Dorthy Parker, with her \\"Men don't make passes..\\" and other witticisms that seemed to spring effortlessly from her mouth, but she was a lot more than a \\"flapper\\" or perhaps an \\"early feminist\\" - she was a true bundle of contradictions.<br />It's not the \\"feel good\\" story of the year, after all, if you've been interested in Dorothy Parker enough to read this far, you already know how the story will end. But it still is a wonderful read.<br />I suggest reading this with \\"The Portable Parker\\" as it definitely gives you an insight into the way her mind worked.<br />I intend to find out the exact address of her ashes and pay a visit to that esteemed place, since I now know where her ashes are located.

She has some small projects at the end of the chapters that would be good for a beginning knitter such as myself.

I recommend this book highly to give you that insight.<br />I must confess I am a fan of Lynn Johnston's \\"For Better or For Worse Seiries\\" and I _have_ had the \\"one more washload blues\\" more than once. It's a great beginning book to introduce you to the characters that Lynn follows faithfully in her daily comic strip. As it's fascinating to watch children grow into adults and see how they turn out, it's wonderful to see how stories get played out in Lynn Johnston's world.<br />So if you've ever had the \\"one more washload blues\\" or you know somebody who has, get this book.

Marla Cilley's mantra is &quot;you can do anything for 15 minutes&quot; and doggone it, she's right. This isn't one of those quicky fixes that is so often put out by folks whose ideas of straightening up the living room is fanning the magazines out in a nice display on the coffee table. This is for folks that are ear deep in junk (or deeper)  and need to get out from under the load of it.<br />Her plan is simple and is based loosely on &quot;The Sidetracked Sisters&quot; works. You take 15 minutes to straighten out an area. I know, I know, you're saying &quot;15 minutes! that doesn't even hit on it!&quot; but it's just a beginning. You learn that you don't have to do everything perfect and you don't have to wait until the kids move out or you get that burst of energy you've been hoping for - you just get up and do it.<br />Sounds simple, right? So why do you need _this_ book? Because if it were that simple, you would have done it already. Because you need somebody who has been there to help walk you out of there.<br />Because getting rid of the clutter has a ripple effect in your life. Because if you read this far, you know you're searching for the answer for your problem. This isn't an easy fix, but your home didn't get to be a mess in one day and it will take more than one day to declutter...unless you_really_ want to maintain the life you're living.<br />And you know you don't - so buy it and work the system.

I know it's supposed to be hip and cool. I also know it's supposed to be based on a classic piece of literature. But it is one of the most overrated books of all time in my opinion. Perhaps it seemed new and innovative when it first came out, but now it's so overhyped it's disgusting.<br />One of my biggest problems with the book is there is no background story - Holden was shipped off to a private school and asked not to return, apparently not the first school he was eased out of - but there's no reason given. Was he destructive? Did he threaten the other students? Or was he merely bored and didn't do schoolwork? Apparently he wasn't that troubled that they booted him out, the school intended to allow him to stay until the end of the semester. I get the impression the reason's a bit more than slacking off of the schoolwork, but it's never given. And in this age after Columbine, it's difficult to figure out what he could have done to be booted from school.<br />The other problem I have is it's all from Holden's point of view - you don't know if he is behaving as crazy as he sounds or he's terribly self-conscious or exactly what is going on within him and around him. There's no description of how the outside world views him, really, just brief spots where others interact with him. He seems utterly miserable and depressed, but I'm never sure if it's the fact he's been booted from another school or he's clinically depressed and needs some sort of intervention.<br />Read the book - if that's your choice or assignment - but know that if you don't think it's a wonderful piece of literature, you're not alone. And if you do think it's a wonderful piece of literature, you're not alone, either.	2002-09-25

These two items make for a book that is a fascinating view of the great poet, Edna St Vincent Millay. Edna lived a life most of us can barely believe - lovers, prizes, fame, fortune  - at a time when females weren't supposed to \\"want it all\\".<br />M's Mitford focuses on M's Millay's relationship with her mother and feels this was the determining factor in M's Millay's life. M's Millay was, to a large extent, abandoned by her mother as her mother tried to provide for three girls. M's Millay, being the oldest, took on the mother role for herself.<br />Her book is punctuated with interviews with Norma, pictures and musings about M's Millay. There can be a bit distracting, especially when you're interested in the events being described at the time. M's Mitford asserts that M's Millay was pregnant and her mother helped her to abort. Outside of a photograph, there doesn't seem to be a lot to support that assertion.<br />I'd advise reading this book with Daniel Mark Epstein's \\"What My Lips Have Kissed\\". His viewpoint is that M's Millay's biggest influence onher life was her many loves. M's Mitford seems right in many respects, but Mr Epstein's poet background seems to work well for him in his view of M's Millay.<br />Buy both books and read them consecutively - it will give you a more accurate picture of Edna St Vincent Millay.	2002-09-20

I was very pleased with the patterns featured and the clear concise instructions. I have been crocheting for about 30 years and it's very unusual to find patterns that are as well written as in &quot;Take Up Crochet&quot;. It's a great book for somebody new to crochet, but it's also great for an &quot;old dog&quot; such as myself to learn some new tricks.	2001-02-26

The drawings are well done, beautifully colored and pair up appropriately to a Walt Whitman poem, Her drawings of animals show more about the animals then mere photographs -  they seem to reach inside the animal's personality and display it for the  world to see. The rabbit on the cover is just the beginning of the  beautiful drawings. Buy many copies of this book, so you can send it to  friends and keep a copy for yourself.	1999-08-19
