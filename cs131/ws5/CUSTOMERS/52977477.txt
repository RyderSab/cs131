The setting was the selling ace for me.  As a contemporary romance, I truly enjoyed due to the story line and the description of the countryside and life in a rural  village of Ireland.  I could have done without the fairie involvement, but  thankfully this was not a major aspect of the story.  The ending leaves you  hanging as to whether the curse of the fairie prince and his Lady was  broken when Aidan and Jade became committed to one another.  The  introduction to Shawn's story (Book 2) indicates they are still cursed.	1999-12-05

This book fringes on fantasy; fairies no less.  I want a good ghost story and thought I was getting just that.  As  others have stated, all answers are not given by its ending, leaving the  reader guessing and wondering what the book's purpose was; to whet the  appetite for &quot;Hope Everlastin&quot;?  For me it makes me wonder if I  want to read the fourth installment.  The first two were better.	1999-07-06

Yes, it held my attention, but loosely.  The intrigue was decent but what made it so unbelievable is how Darby  outwitted hardened,world-renowned criminals, the FBI, and CIA----absolute  fantasy!<br />Does not come close to as good as a story as his other two  novels I mentioned.	1999-07-06

This feels strange to say since I would rather read a good book than watch a good movie.  To  me, this says his stories can be interesting, suspenseful, and/or  horrifying; also, difficult to weed through and totally off-the-wall.   Having said this, &quot;Gerald's Game&quot; was the best story I have read  of his.  I can't believe some of the negative comments of previous  reviewers.  This is a great story that draws you in from the very first  page.  A plausible story yet the telling of it makes you experience the  horror and fear as though it was happening to you.  The tie-in of her  childhood experiences were terrific and the ending segment was as good as  reading two books in one.  Again, the tie-in was fantastic!	1999-03-09

Superb! Beautiful!	Any animal lover will appreciate this book and I would like to see those who do not possess a love for animals to read it and see how many become believers in the lives and feelings of one of our most valuable and blessed  gifts from  God.  When I would begin to read this book I would say to  myself, &quot; I will read 2 or 3 then go to bed.&quot;  Impossible.  You  cannot put it down.  Yes, tissues were a necessity and prayers of  thanksgiving were frequent.  Most of all, again we are shown that God uses  animals to help us in many ways and we are given the opportunity to receive  blessings from coming in contact with  God's creatures. Another book that  clearly portrays God's purpose of putting humans and animals together is  Ralph Helfer's &quot;Modoc:  The World's Greatest Elephant.&quot;  A quite  moving read.	1999-01-03

BEAUTIFUL!  Very moving, especially if you are familiar  with the Bible  correlations.  I was so overcome with emotion I had to let  my oldest son finish reading some of the stories aloud.  Since they were  young, I explained the moral of the story and how it was based on God's  word.  Now that they are older, I want to purchase this book and again read  the stories to them.

It is a very  powerful love story with periods of humor, but what impressed me most is  the handling of the research that tries to explain the &quot;slip in  time.&quot; The focus of the book was not just the romance, but also the  details of what was occurring.	1998-10-15

(Dead Letter Mysteries)	Books	3	1	3	N	N	A little disappointed	The cover caught me, the title was right down my alley, the setting was  just what I like, and the cincher was the quotes, &quot;a good fireside  read&quot; and &quot;if you can't see the gardens of England yourself, you  can with this book&quot; (paraphrased).  I HAD to read this!  The book was  enjoyable and the characters fun, but the story was lacking seriousness and  at times disjointed.  I wanted to finish because I did want to travel  through England and &quot;see&quot; the gardens and also to see whodunit.   My expectation of a dramatic climax is where my disappointment comes in.  I  was not totally unhappy with the book but the ending was not what I  expected.	1998-09-15

I  was wrong.  This personal account from someone who has nothing to gain from  her discussion of her relationship with Diana, shows us the Princess' true  nature; one of sincere love and caring for others.  The most enjoyable  sections were the first-hand accounts of the pre-wedding activities, the  wedding, and the funeral.  I was very moved by this revealing look into the  life of Diana.  After reading numerous articles and books regarding her  life; this I found refreshing, again, because it was written by someone  without an agenda of personal gain.  Yes, I did look to see if any of the  proceeds from the book were to be donated to the Princess' Fund; a portion  will be donated.	1998-08-24

This title drew me to the book.  A few of my friends stated it was not that good of a read, but the title kept drawing me back until finally I checked it out. An interesting present day story that moves rather slowly and Charlie's woes began to grind on my nerves, but I remained interested.  I wondered how the author was going to pull the present-day story and the story from the past together, but she did. The result was worth the wait and I thoroughly enjoyed the story from the past.  A nice comfortable book; worth the repetitious saga of Charlie in the beginning.	1998-07-21

The story itself is good with an original beginning, but it is the ending that makes it exceptional.

Overall, I enjoyed &quot;The Notebook&quot; more, but they are different types of stories.	1998-05-25

If this had been fiction I don't know if I would have been able to finish it.  I had to keep telling myself the information was taken directly from the court records, otherwise it would have seemed ridiculous and unbelievable.  It's only redeeming trait is the psychological profile of Karl Hettinger---excellent! This part of the story was very well written with great insight into the effect the occurence had on Hettinger and how that effect manifested itself.  Since it is a true story, it shows alot about the workings of our justice system and how criminals use it to try to get out of their just punishment.	1998-04-21

Usually, I devour her stories and find them difficult to put them down.  This one was okay, but more wordy than she usually is; especially, within the first half of the book.  Also, the story was a little less believable than her others.  I agree with the previous reviewer in that the reader is to decide what was really happening and even after  finishing,  the reader determines what they want to believe.  But I do not agree that this is Ms. Michaels best.	1998-03-25

Although it was not what I expected, I was surprised I enjoyed it, even though the romance element was definitely hard to find.  In various books the history of smuggling on the English coast has been mentioned and this story centers around these crimes explaining in much more detail.  Therefore, it is an interesting history lesson.	1998-03-25

Some interesting subplots occur while trying to solve the murder that happened 60-70 years previously within the house.  A troubled marriage, a developmentally disabled child, a romance, secretive townspeople, and the restoration of the house blend well with the main story.	1998-02-18

As one of the previous reviewers stated, I thank Ralph Helfer for giving us the gift of Modoc's story and I thank God for giving us the pleasure of his creatures.  Like another reviewer, the cover caught my eye while browsing in a bookstore.  After reading the inside flap, I knew I had to read this one!  Often with books and movies about animals, I wasn't sure I could finish the book if it became upsetting.  It does evoke strong emotional responses; alas, I absolutely could not put it down.  Several reviewers commented on the difficult writing style of Mr. Helfer, but I did not find it so; possibly because the story is so engrossing.  After I finished, I told my husband that anyone, after reading this story, had to believe animals will be in Heaven.  I have recommended this story to the members of our local book club, two read it and said they liked it greatly.  Also, I make a point to recommend to anyone I talk with who likes to read; they must read Modoc.	1998-02-18

In doing research on Poe and the story itself, this is one of the books found to be related to the original story.  It has a very interesting twist, the most obvious one is having Poe as a character within the story.  Yes, I had my doubts at first, also, but it works!  If you liked Anne Rice's Witching Hour series, you should also enjoy Madeline.  The storyline is similiar as far as having a &quot;family involvement&quot; is concerned.  If you read Poe's Fall of Usher, I'm sure you have some questions you would like to ask Poe.  Well, Madeline helps with these loose ends.	1998-02-18

The movie, like the actual case, left us with many unanswered questions.  Ms. Engstrom has cleverly filled in the missing parts of the story.  According to the author, she has done much research of the case, therefore, her rendering is fairly believable.  Do I believe everything she endeavored to answer?  No.   But her attempts are plausible.  I would like to know what facts she discovered to reach her conclusions and what are really facts and what is the author's imagination.  If you are interested in this bizzare case, you will enjoy this novel.	1997-12-23
