You *cannot* take these kinds of things seriously, per se - you just have to enjoy them for what they are - brief &quot;missing scenes&quot; which were written in *homage* to Jane Austen's stories, and which *do* fit well into the works themselves in terms of characterization, manner and writing style, but *obviously*, *clearly* and *blatently* are 21st century writings!	2001-05-15

If you read it as a good story that has various homages to Pride &amp; Prejudice contained in it, then it's fine, great, a plesant thing to read on the beach or on a plane (which is where I read it the first time). But if you read it for a full-fathom retelling of Austen's P&amp;P, you won't get it. Clueless is closer to Emma, Cruel Intentions closer to Les Liasons Dangerous, but while BJD may be inspired by P&amp;P, it's not close to it.	2001-05-15

Yes, it makes Jacob and Issac look pretty bad - and of course,  Jacob's sons never have come off looking like good guys, given the whole  Joseph story, but the failings of the men and women in these ancient times  makes them more human.

I'm about 6 weeks away from my due date, and am using this book as a tool for exercise information breathing information and info about the stages of labor; I wanted to use it for insight about labor practices, what to expect  in the delivery room, and guidelines about what a laboring woman needs to  do and know if she wants to try natural childbirth, but it is so out of  date, at least in terms of my hospital's practices, that all those sections  are completely useless.  I don't mind the criticisms of Lamaze - as someone  who can't hyperventilate while jogging, and doesn't expect to be able to  while laboring, and as someone who has no visual-mind connection and can't  see how she'll get something out of the Hang A Picture On The Wall Or  Visualize Something concept, I think there are some well deserved  criticisms of the method.  BUT theorizing that in 20 years doctors may  discover hazards of ultrasounds may've made sense in the 1983 version, but  in the 1996 revision, those sections should have been revised; by the way  it's written, you can tell that it wasn't. Also, even though I understand  the Bradley people's views about epidurals, the way epidurals are done has  changed over the past 20 years, but since the Method is against it  entirely, they didn't seem to care enough to correct the now-inaccurate  sections on how they are given and what the effects are.  Plus, it's all  fine &amp; dandy to recommend eating 2 eggs each day, but that's pretty  useless if you, like me, have a serious pregnancy-related food aversion to  eggs. I can't even be in the same room as someone cooking them. And of  course, there's no substitute or replacement suggested. All in all, if  you're buying it because you, like me, want to have more info about  breathing the BRadley way, or about the exercises, it's worth a few bucks.  If you're buying it because you want it to be the be-all-and-end-all of  your labor education experience, you risk going into the hospital with a  lot of scary misinformation. <br />ps - in terms of c-section ratio, it's more  useful to learn what your doctor's is for your specific kind of situation  (i.e. if you're a first time mother in her 20's, versus a second time  mother who had an emergency caesarean the first time, and is in her 40's)  than their overall rate.	1999-06-16
