I looked at it at the Christian bookstore so many times. So finally this year, I finally broke down and bought it. After hearing yet again how powerful it is. I have admit, I was somewhat surprised at the format of the book. But once I actually started looking through it, I was very impressed. This book doesn't just give you a paragraph of general prayer requests. It goes country by country and lists both praises and prayer challenges. It also lists how much and what kind of Christian witness is currently taking place in each country. I can't tell you how many times I have cried my eyes out while praying through the information listed in this book. I believe that this book has increased my love and passion for the lost and has revolutionized my prayer life. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has a heart for missions or who wants to change their pray life forever.  <br /> <br />I also want to comment about the charge of ecumencism. This is something that I am very concerned about. I was a bit concerned about that with this book as well. But agree with the reviewer who said that this book puts those fears to rest. There is not a single spot in Operation World where cults are portrayed positively. They are mentioned as a reality in the country. In fact, the cults are often mentioned as things to pray about in the prayer challenges section. There are a lot of books out there that definitely are Ecumenical in nature. I'm not denying that. But in my opinion, Operation World is not one of those books.	2005-08-08

But some of my favorites are personal biographies. I stumbled across this series in the Christian bookstore and this was the third one I bought.  <br /> <br />This in an incredible story of a man who was willing to go WAY outside his comfort zone and minister to people a lot of Christians wouldn't want to minister to. Mr McClung is a perfect example of a person compelled by love for Christ and the lost. This man is also a great example of the power of prayer and of faith.  <br /> <br />This book will make you squirm. It will cause you to look at things from an entirely new perspective. This book pulls no punches and gets down and dirty. But I think this book should be required for every Christian, especially those who feel they are being called to the mission field. I highly recommend this book.	2005-08-08
US	44299541	R2A8H1Z6MQBI2R	0830705295	47097075	Lords of the Earth	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Powerful	This is an incredible true story of a man passionate to reach for Christ those who have never heard. It also clearly illustrates the darkness, evil and despair that comes from idolatry. But it also shows the true liberation and freedom that can come only for Christ. This book will draw you in from the first page.  <br /> <br />The world needs more people like Stan. People who are willing to trust solely in God and how are willing to go to dangerous remote areas to share Christ. This book will shatter your complaceny and force you to think. I highly recommend this book. For all Christians, but especially those (like me) who have  heart for missions. This book details the good, the bad, and the ugly of missions work.	2005-06-23

This book is very disturbing and shocking. I definitely think that Christian churches do have a problem with \\"shooting their wounded\\" rather than coming along side of them.  <br /> <br />Overall, I don't think this book is anywhere near as good as Wisdom Hunter.

It deals with so many important issues. Issues which a lot of people are afraid to touch with a ten foot pole. I very much appreciate the honesty and transparency of the authors in this book. I have struggled with so many of the same issues. The advice in this book is practical and most of all, biblical. This book is very convicting and will give you a lot to think about. The chapters that were most challenging for me personally were the ones on feminity and purity. I think women of all ages would benefit from reading this book.	2005-05-28

Stormie gives the reader the benefit of her own struggles and experiences. This book helped me to see areas in my own life where I haven't been praising God and I need to. This book has helped me to realize that truly is important, not just to us, but ultimately to God.<br /><br />If you are looking for a way to revolutionize or re-energize your prayer life, read this book. Don't read this book too quickly. Take time to meditate on everything and more important on the Scriptures. There is so much packed into each chapter that I also recommend reading the book more than once. I find that I almost always glean new insights from a book the second time around. This book will challenge and convict you. God alone is worthy of our praise. This book will help you realize just how deserving God truly is of our glory and praise.<br /><br />I also like the fact that Stormie broadens the expression of worship to include more than singing. I think that a lot of times, Christians today think of worship as only singing and only something they do at church. But Stormie says (and I agree)that worship shouldn't be something we do just once a week. It needs to become a lifestyle. That that is your desire, this book will show you the way.	2005-05-28

The author is extreamly vulnerable about the emotional trauma that came into her life after being bitten on the face by a dog when she was 8 years old. She talks about how she allowed a name given to her in childhood to define and determine her identity and worth in adulthood. She also talks very openly about her intense struggle to overcome the labels and the lies and to move into the truth of her identity in Christ.  <br /> <br />As I read, I was deeply touched because I could identify with so many of Sally's struggles. Especially her feelings of self-hatred and worthlessnes.  <br /> <br />This book doesn't offer any quick fixes. In fact, the author admits that there are still things that she struggles with. She also shares several songs that she and her husband have written.  <br /> <br />This book gave me hope that I could overcome the past and that things can change for me. It also helped me to realize that I'm not the only one who struggles with these types of issues.  <br /> <br />If you are woman (especially a Christian women) who is struggling with feelings of low self-worth, despair, helplessness, being stuck in the past and self-hatred, do yourself a favor. Get this book and read it cover to cover. In fact, read it more than once. I also highly recommend \\"Beauty by the Book\\" by Nancy Stafford.	2005-05-19
US	44299541	R1VLT46GSLH1RG	0882434942	675372942	Ever Increasing Faith	Books	1	56	111	N	N	Biblically unsound	It concerns me that not one previous reviewer recognized the Biblical problems that run through out this book.<br /><br />This book is absolutely riddled with unbiblical teachings. I will list 7 unscriptural teachings that I found in this book. I'm sure there are others, but these are the ones that jumped out to me.<br /><br />First, Smith Wigglesworth teaches throughout this book that sickness is always demonic and it is caused by sin. According to Wigglesworth there is no other possible cause for sickness. He also teaches repeatidly that if a person is not healed, the reason is a lack of faith.<br /><br />The Bible, however teaches something very different. Yes, sickness can be the result of sin. For example, Miriam being struck with leprosy. But that is not the ONLY cause of sickness in Scripture. the Bible lists at least two other causes.<br /><br /> In fact, Jesus Himself confronted this very issue. Right before He healed the man born blind, someone asked Him \\"Who sinned, this man or his parents?\\" John 9:22-23 give Jesus's response. He replied \\"Neither this man nor his parents sinned. But this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life.\\"<br /><br />Another verse that refutes this teaching is Exodus 4:11 which says \\"Who has made man's mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives sight or makes him blind? Is it not I, the Lord?\\"<br /><br />A second possible cause of sickness according to Scripture is that it comes from Satan. The best example of this is Job. But Jesus also heals a woman who couldn't stand upright as the result of a spirit (Luke 13:11-13)<br /><br />In his excellent book \\"Charismatic Chaos\\" John MacArthur has this to say \\"Suggesting that someone's sickness is necessarily related to personal sin is as unfeeling and cruel as telling people they are not healed because they lack faith.\\" I wholeheartidly agree. Yet, that is precisely what Wigglesworth does over and over again in this book.<br /><br />The second area of concern is where Wigglesworth says that he questions whether the Holy Spirit is truly present without the gifts of the Spirit (specifically tongues and healing) That teaching has no basis in Scripture whatsoever. Yes, there were times where amazing things happened and the gifts of the Spirit were present, for example at Pentecost. But there are numerous other examples where the gifts of the Spirit are not even mentioned. This is not an either/or it's a both/and. Sometimes the gifts will be present when the Spirit moves, sometimes they will not.<br /><br />Third, Wigglesworth teaches that even someone who lacks character can see the Lord. This is refuted in Psalm 66:18 as well as in 1st John 3:6 and 1st John 5:18<br /><br />Fourth, one of the teachings I found most disturbing is where Wigglesworth says \\"Do not say \\"I was saved by faith\\" or \\"I was healed by faith.\\" Faith does not save or heal.\\"<br /><br />Jesus said numerous times that faith DOES heal and save. So, either Wigglesworth is wrong, or Jesus is. But they can't both be true.<br /><br />For example, to the woman who had an issue of blood for 12 years, Jesus said \\"Go, your faith has healed you.\\" This story is repeated in Mark and Luke also.<br /><br />Jesus also said the same thing to the blind beggar whose story is told in Luke 18:42<br /><br />Jesus also told people their faith had saved them. For example, the sinner woman in the house of Simon the Pharasee Jesus told her. \\"Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.\\" Other Scriptures that contradict this teaching are Romans 5:1, Romans 3 and Hebrews 11. In addition Ephesians 2:8 says For it is by grace you have been saved, THROUGH FAITH (emphasis mine)<br /><br />Fifth, there are at least two instances that Wigglesworth claims to have seen Jesus. Once, he claims Jesus appeared at the bed of a sick woman and smiled at him. Another time, Wigglesworth claims to have seen Jesus pass by his window. He describes both encounters in a flippant and casual manner. This bears littleresemblence to people in Scripture who saw the Risen Christ. For example, Isaiah. When He saw Christ he replied \\"Woe is me, for I am undone!\\" In Revelation 1, John describes what happened when He saw Christ. John tells us he \\"fell down as though dead.\\" Paul is another example. His life was radically changed after his encounter with the risen Christ. The same is true of the Apostles after they saw Christ after his ressurection.<br /><br />Sixth, Wigglesworth claims that the reason Ananais and Sapphira were killed is because they doubted God and lacked faith. In Acts 5 tells us exactly why Ananais and Sapphira lost their lives. Peter tells us it was because of their greed and because they lied to the Holy Spirit. To be fair, I think an arguement could be made that it was a lack of faith. But the evidence for that in the biblical account is slim at best. It is dangerous to read something into Scripture that isn't there or to base a doctrine on one verse, taken out of context.<br /><br />Lastly, in one instance, Wigglesworth claims that a man experienced a temporary, partial healing and that he had to pray for the man a second time in order for him to be fully healed. Now, let me say this. I do believe that God still heals today. But I also believe that Satan can counterfit healings. I believe, that is what most, if not all of the \\"healings\\" performed by Wigglesworth were. Also, as with most Charismatics, the healings were for mainly for internal problems. Wigglesworth almost never says that the \\"healing\\" was verified by a doctor. Anyone who knows even a little about Scripture knows that Jesus performed numerous healings, as did the Apostles after Pentecost. Peter and Paul also healed people. Every single time, without exception, when someone was healed in Scripture, three things happened. The healing was total, immediate and permanent. No one who was healed ever had to come back to be healed a second time. Jesus never once partially healed a disease or physical ailment. He healed the person completely so that no trace of the sickness or disease remained.<br /><br />I wish I could say that this type of error is unique to Wigglesworth. Sadly, it's not. In fact, there are many other Charismatic authors who teach the same errors. Every Christian, especially those involved with the Charismatic Movement, must be discerning. As I once heard someone say \\"Just because something claims to be Christian, doesn't mean it's kosher.\\" Today is seems like anything is acceptable as long as it is labled Christian.<br /><br />I have nothing against Charismatics as people. I know there are many who truly love the Lord. But we must be extreamly careful about who we allow to teach us.<br /><br />If anyone would like to read more about the problems with the Charismatic movement, I highly recommend John MacArthur's book \\"Charismatic Chaos\\" It deals many of these same issues.	2005-04-24

I truly enjoyed this book. It spoke to me on so many levels.  <br /> <br />This book is gritty and realistic. I disagree with the reviewers who think that this book describes sin too graphically. Yes, it is graphic. But whitewashing the truth and papering over it doesn't do anyone any good. Life is tough and sin is real. Scripture itself doesn't sugarcoat sin. It describes rape, incest, murder and other sin in graphic detail. We must be balanced. We shouldn't go to extreams. Sin shouldn't be glorified, but it also shouldn't be whitewashed and ignored. This book deals in powerful way with sin and redemption. Jesus Himself was willing to minister to prostitutes, adulterers, murders, drunks and lepors. He was willing to minister to the very bottom dwellers of society. How can we who claim to be His followers do any less? Jesus has given us the perfect model of who to deal with sin. He confronted it head on. He never condemned or judged people for even blatant sin, but neither did He ignore or condone it.  <br /> <br />This book provides much food for thought. So much so, it's easy to forget it's fiction. I was hooked by the end of the first chapter.  <br /> <br />This is a book to be read and pondered and thought about deeply.	2005-04-19

It is concise, uncompromising and totally committed to a through exegisis of Scripture. I find it disturbing that books such as this are even needed today. But sadly, they are. Most profressing Christians are so biblically illierate that they don't know how to recognize truth, much less error and deception. Here again, I find myself wishing I could disagree with MacArthurs findings and teachings, but yet again, I can't. I have to say, the other contributers to this book are on the same caliber as MacArthur himself. Which isn't surprising, considering they all serve at MacArthur's church. I found this book very practical and very disturbing. It is  also very convicting.  <br /> <br />I have struggled with some of the very things addressed in this book. This book has shown me that my concerns are not unfounded. I truly believe that MacArthur is not overstating his case. Discernment is crucial today. The reader is encouraged to critique every sermon, book, song, teaching, movement and everything else that is labeled Christian through the grid of Scripture. This is a book that should be read and re-read. MacArthur has done a great service to the church by writing this book. Everyone who professes to know Christ would do well to take his message and his advice to heart.	2005-04-07

However, I am sure glad I didn't let that stop me from buying this book.  The authors of tackle this difficult subject with insight, compassion and sensitivity. They do not offer pat answers or a quick fix. This book is very well rounded. It deals with the why of anger as well as the how. It talks about hidden forms of anger. It also offers hope and lets the reader know that they are not alone. It also refutes many of the myths and lies about anger.  This book also offers practical, useable solutions about how to identify and then overcome anger. I highly recommend this book to women of any age who are struggling with anger. Even if you are like me, and have struggled with anger for many years. I have read quite a few others books on anger and I have to say, this is one of the best.<br /><br />Another book on Anger that I highly recommend is Anger is a Choice by Tim LaHaye and Bob Phillips.	2005-03-24

But as I read, I was challenged and convicted, by his faith and his willingness to do whatever God asked of him.  <br /> <br />I disagree with the reviewer who said that this book has a theological problem. The things Rees did (like not wearing a hat and growing his hair long) are things the Lord asked him to do. They are things that he didn't just decide to do on his own. I think that is an important distinction to make. I also believe it is impossible to effectively intercede unless you walk a mile in their shoes. There were occassions when Rees did this in a literal sense. But it seems to me, that he did it more often in a spiritual sense.  <br /> <br />I found myself identifying a lot with Rees as I read. The man was not perfect, he definitely had faults. I don't mean to imply that I think he didn't. But the Lord used him in a mighty way and I think Rees has things to teach us all.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to break out of complacent Christianity. This book will change your life and your relationship with the Lord, if you read it with an open mind and an open, teachable heart. This is a book to read slowly. You will want to take time to digest and meditate on it. I would also recommend reading it more than once. I have often found that I always gain new insights on the second or third time through. This is one book you will want to glean every possible insight from. There is so much here.  <br /> <br />This is one of the most life-changing books I have ever read.	2005-03-11

I didn't realize until after I bought it that it was intended for teenagers (I'm in my late 20s and single) But I'm not at all sorry I bought this book. The Lord has really been convincing me lately of the importance of being sexually pure. I was looking for a book that not only discussed purity but how to live it out. This book gives some great tips. I can't wait to try them out for myself. I wish I had had this information when I was a young teenager. It would have saved me a lot of grief, regret and heartache. But while no one can change the past, with God's help and the tips in this book. You can change the future. I appreciate the author's honest. Yes, she is married, but she is very much aware of the struggles that young single women face. I think this book should be required reading for every teenager and for every parent with teenage girls. I would definitely recommend this book to others.	2005-02-27

It doesn't just deal with the power of words, but also deals with the heart issues behind the words. This book is VERY convicting and it will make you uncomfortable. It made me face some painful things about myself. But this book doesn't offer pat answers and simple solutions. The author is very honest about his own struggles in this area. If you too, struggle with controlling your tongue, buy this book. It will help you. I highly recommend this book. This book should be required reading for every Christian.

I highly recommend this book to any Christian who desires how to learn to hear God's voice for yourself. This is one book you will definitely want to read more than once. Marilyn doesn't come across at all as \\"I have all the answers\\" in fact, she readily admits she doesn't have all the answers. Her honesty and vulnerablilty about her own struggles are refreshing.

On the one hand, the principles Gwen sets out in this book do work. When I started this program back in July I weighed 239 (the heaviest I've ever been) As of today, with the Lord's help, I weigh 212. I've always known I could never stick with a restrictive diet. But this is one I can stick to. It's so easy and no one has to know. You can eat this way in public or anywhere else. No one will know unless you tell them. I feel this book is biblically sound.  <br /> <br />That said, I do have serious reservations about recommending this book because of Gwen's new church. I have done some research and do believe it is a cult. While I would recommend this book to others, I cannot recommend anything Gwen has written since \\"The Weigh Down Diet\\" Which is a real shame. If it weren't for her teaching of false doctrine, I think Gwen would have some great insights to share with anyone who has ever struggled with their weight. But under the circumstances, I think it best to avoid the teachings of Gwen Shamblin (apart from this book) at all costs.	2004-10-30

I wish I could say that I disagree with John's findings and say that I think he is blowing things way out of proportion, but I can't.

I have strugged with various fears for the majority of my life. I have read several books on fear, but this book stands out from the rest. <br />Dr Wright not only provides the tools to understand and identify your fears, but also to overcome them. I have found that most books on fear are heavy on the identifaction of fear, but say almost nothing about overcoming it. I saw myself over and over again in the examples given by Dr Wright. <br />Also, the principles he gives are practical and more important, biblical. These are principles that are easy to implement. <br />Lastly, this book gave me something else. Hope. For the first time, I have hope that I can (with the Lord's help) conquer my fears. Dr Wright correctly calls fear a prison. I can tell you from firsthand experience, that is exactly what it is. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with fear of any kind. Whether it's phobias or relational fears. This book has been life-changing for me.	2004-06-24

Ray Comfort and Kirk Cameron share real-life situations and insights about witnessing and take all the guesswork out of it. This book will deepen your concern for lost people and will motivate you to start witnessing. Another thing I like about this book is that it soundly refutes the idea of &quot;easy believism&quot; and tells the hard truth. We aren't doing unbelievers any favors by giving them a feel good, warm fuzzy, incomplete gospel. Jesus did not preach easy believism. This is another book that every professing believer should read. Well written and practical.	2004-04-18

This book should be required reading for everyone who professes to be a Christian. <br />At first, I have to admit I was skeptical. I have never heard of using the law in evangelism. It flies in the face of modern evangelistic methods. But Ray Comfort convinced me. I have also done some online research and have found that Ray Comfort his not the only person who talks about false conversions and using the law. <br />This book was life-changing for me. This book has caused me to re-evaluate many of my views about evangelism and has forced me to face the reality of false conversion in my own life. I don't have to words to express how thankful I am for this book. My life will never be the same.	2004-04-18

But I do listen to him on the radio and have a couple of his teaching tapes. <br />In my humble opinion, this book is MacArthur at his very best. John MacArthur will tell it like it is. He is a very straight shooter and pulls no punches. <br />The whole &quot;easy believism&quot; craze has concerned me greatly for sometime. As does the incredibly high number of backsliders that is produces. One of the things that I respect most about John MacArthur is his willingness to preach on difficult subjects and his willingness to make his listeners uncomfortable. John definitely not not sugarcoat the truth, but I don't think he crosses the line into &quot;hellfire&quot; preaching either. I think this is a very well thought out and convicting book. It clearly shows MacArthur's concern for his readers/listeners and comes straight from his heart. There is no doubting his passion and sincerity. <br />This is not a book to read for enjoyment. This is a book to ponder, digest and apply. I believe this book will change your life, if you read it with an open mind and an open heart.	2004-04-18

I have read a bunch of issues of Yohannan's magazine and she also sent me a video of Yohannan. <br />Don't read this book if you enjoy complacent Christianity. This book will take you out of your comfort zone and make you think. <br />I agree that native missionaries can reach people in ways that Western Christians can't. That may be a hard truth for some to swallow. But I think it's true nonetheless. <br />I respect Yohannan's vulnerablility, passion, integrity and honesty. Yohannan's writing style is easy to read. He uses simple words, but they pack a powerful punch. I think every Christian should read this book. People who are considering going into missions definitely need this book. It will help you develop an eternal perspective about things such as evangelism and money. I think Yohanan's observations about the American church are especially powerful. We in the west definitley need to re-evaluate our view of missions and native missionaries. Personally, I think that these men and women who are native missionaries put us to shame. They are willing to be persecuted, beaten and even killed to share Christ with others. Meanwhile, we in the west whine if we have to suffer even a little. I'm not trying to make a sweeping generalization. I've been guilty of that myself. We like things quick and easy. This book is definitely a must read. <br />This is definitely a book you will need to read more than once. Check it out! You won't be sorry.	2004-04-08

This book gives a very clear explaination of what brokenness is, and what it is not. The author also does a compare and contrast between pride and brokenness. This book is very convicting. If you let Him, God can give you a good look into your heart. This happened with me and the results were painful and definitely not pretty. But it was necessary. The author also uses real life examples. Both from her own life and others. Nancy is very honest about her own struggles with brokenness and pride. As you read, you get the feeling that she wrote this book as much for herself, as for others. This book showed me areas of pride that I never realized existed. If you want to remain complacent, don't read this book. This is one of the best books on grace and brokenness that I have ever read. Thank you Nancy!	2004-03-08

So I was looking for a book to help me deal with my grief. I bought this book at a Christian bookstore. So you can imagine my disappointment when I discovered the author is more concerned with spirituality than with a Christian worldview. About this only good thing I can say about this book is that it did help me to feel that my feelings of grief and loss over my dog's death are natural and normal. <br />Much of the advice the author (who claims to be a Christian) gives is unbiblical and I believe dangerous. For example, she shares numerous stories of people who believe their pet's spirit came back to let them know they were okay. She also says that she believes people's pets will be in Heaven. She also makes references to pet pychics and one woman says she believes that her cat has had past lives and is more than just a cat. NONE of this is supported by the Bible. In fact, the Bible clearly condemns astrology and going to psychics of any kind. I believe the author has good intentions, but in my opinion, this book can not be called Christian. <br />This book reminds me again the importance of discernment. Just because you buy a book at a Christian bookstore, does not mean that it's biblically based or theologically sound.  I don't know if there are any truly Christian books on this subject. But if you are serious about reading things that are doctrinally correct and biblically based skip this book.	2004-02-28

Not only is this book biblically based,<br />it's a breath of fresh air. This book discusses how all the<br />resources we need for an abundant Christian life are already<br />inside of us if we have the Holy Spirit (and all true Christians<br />do!) But it also makes the point the the way to access those resources is not through self-effort and trying really hard. Also, I like that Edwards is not afraid to deal with touchy issues like legalism, tradition, personal taste and cultural expressions of Christianity. Rather than making the subject of depending on God and surrendering to His will sound boring, Edwards instead makes it sound exciting and something worth getting pumped up about. I can't say enough good things about this book. Every Christian should read this book!	2004-02-28

I had a hard time getting through the book and didn't really feel like I learned much of anything. I also feel that the title is very misleading. I bought this book expecting to learn about about walking in the Spirit/being led by the Spirit. But this book devotes only a single chapter to those subjects. Another concern I had about this book is that I felt it wasn't biblically based. My recommendation is to skip this book.

This book has changed my life and how I view the Christian life. <br />This book has helped me to be set free from the bondage of legalism and the incredibly frustrating and exhausting cycle of trying and failing. For a long time, I felt that God was always disappointed in me and that no matter how much I did, it was never enough. This book has also helped me realize that I was trying to live the Christian life through self-effort. This book also helped me to realize that I should be doing Christian things like reading the Bible, going to church etc, because I want to. Not because I feel like I have to. This book has lifted a huge weight off my shoulders and my heart. <br />If you feel trapped in the cycle of trying and failing, like I was, read this book. Steve is very vulnerable about his own struggles in this area. This book is a breath of fresh air and will change your life. This book will also help you to understand that you are not alone in your struggles. Others have been through the same thing. It will also remind you that God cares and understands.	2004-02-17

I have struggled for almost all my Christian life with shame and feeling like I'm never good enough. I could identify so much with the section on shame based relating. This book not only helps you pinpoint the problem, but also offers sensible, down to earth solutions. For the first time, I have come to believe, deep down in my heart, that God's love and acceptance of me is not based on my performance. I can't even begin to describe all the ways that God has used this book in my life.

This book reads like a conversation with a trusted friend. Cindi is extreamly open about her own struggles and is very vulnerable. This book will touch your heart and will help you see your Heavenly Father in an entirely new way. I definitely intend to read more of Cindi's books.

This book will not only get you on your way down the road to healing and wholeness, it will give you something else. HOPE. I was so encouraged by this book and it also showed me that I am not alone in my struggles. Even if I do feel that way. It has been a major struggle for me to believe deep down, that Jesus loves me unconditionally. <br />I also like that this book is geared towards women of all ages and walks of like. Not just for particular age group, just singles or just marrieds. I believe EVERY woman who reads this book will benefit.

I found it to be very well documented and I liked that it drew from interviews and Oneness writings rather than just rumor. This book is well worth reading both for Oneness believers and for those, like me, who just want to have a better understanding of the beliefs and practices of the UPC. The only problem I had with this book was all the footnotes. I found myself getting bogged down and by the end, I just skipped most of the footnotes. I was impressed with how well documented all the information was. The author doesn't expect his reader to just take his word for things. I highly recommend this book.	2003-09-14

This book really opened my eyes to the unbiblical doctrines of the UPC. Oneness is only one of the heretical doctrines taught by the UPC. This book also shows how Oneness Pentecostals have a basic misunderstanding of what the doctrine of the Trinity really teaches.This book has also strengthened my belief in the Trinity. Dr Boyd quotes extensively from accepted Oneness doctrine and Oneness writers, so I think it's unfair to say that the Oneness position is misrepresented. I read this book after reading &quot;Christianity Without the Cross&quot; and found that Dr Boyd's book describes very well what Oneness Pentecostals believe. <br />I highly recommmend this book to anyone who wants solid Biblical support for the doctrine of the Trinity or to refute Oneness doctrine.	2003-09-14

It's to the point now where I am desperate for change. It was that desperation that caused me to pick up this book. I loved the way the authors used real life examples and charts and diagrams. I also got so much out of the self-tests. The section on temperment was very eye opening for my personally. I definitely found my own temperment. But most of all, this book not only gives hope of real change, it lays out a process of getting there. The problem is neither quick nor easy, but it is possible. I recommend this book to anyone, Christian or not who has struggled with anger. I've read several books on the subject and this is one of the best books out there. It does not just deal with the symptoms of anger, but helps you get to the root cause of your anger. This is one book that I know I will refer to time and time again.	2003-07-10

This book forced me to take a good look inside myself. I found I could identify with so much of what Lisa shared.

Reading this book was both worthwhile and painful. Dr Crabb tells it like it is, but does so in a humble and loving way. This book will give a lot to think about and ponder and points the way to a deeper walk with Christ. This is a book I intend to read again and again. <br />I think this book should be read by all Christians, including new Christians.

I think new Christians would especially benefit from this book. However, I have been a Christian for 10 years and I also got a lot out of this book. This book has given me a clearer understand of what exactly stewardship is and how to live it out. Before, I had only a hazy understanding of the meaning of stewardship, much less how to live it out. This book convicted me in so many different ways and caused me to re-think many of my previous attitudes towards both stewardship and giving.

A friend recommended this book to me and was also kind enough to give me a copy. I had read one of Stormie's other books and liked it very much. I had seen this book in Christian bookstores, but never thought of purchasing it. But as soon as I read the back cover, I couldn't wait to read it. I can honestly say that this book has changed my life. It has helped me to get a more accurate view of both myself and God. One of the things I like best about this book is Stormie's transparency and honesty about her own struggles and failures. She tells it like it is and doesn't sugarcoat it. This book has given me hope that I too, can reach a place of emotional wholeness and restoration. Another thing that I really like about this book is that Stormie tells her readers upfront that she isn't offering a quick fix. She is very upfront about the fact that emotional wholeness is a process and that will can be a very long and painful process. But she also reminds the reader that with God all things are possible.I have read this book once already (in a single sitting) and intend to read it again and again,especially when I am feeling discouraged. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with emotional/spiritual issues and longs for wholeness and restoration.	2002-08-19

This book packs quite a punch. It talks about how Jesus defined discipleship and what Biblical discipleship looks like. <br />This book is also practical. The author uses real-life examples from his own life and the lives of others. It is obvious the author has a very clear understanding of the topic of discipleship and wants the reader to have an equally clear understanding. He talks about what the Bible has to say about discipleship, the lack of true discipleship in the church today, what true discipleship looks like, the cost of discipleship (in my opinion, this is the most challenging,chapter of all) and the rewards of discipleship. The author also discusses unpopular subjects such as repentance, humility, obedience and dying to self as key components of discipleship. The author also takes a very strong stand against the notion of \\"easy believism\\" which is so prevalent and popular in American Christianity today. <br />This book should be required reading for every Christian. Especially new Christians. But veteran believers will also benefit greatly from this book. This book will break you out of complacent Christianity and will get you outside your comfort zone. In my opinion, this is one of the best books on discipleship out there.	2002-07-02

When the professor told us about it, I thought this book sounded really interesting. I'm not a Science Fiction fan at all, but I thought this sounded like something I would like. I was wrong. <br />It held my interest for about the first quarter of the book, but once Stephenson started getting into all the Sumerian stuff, I quickly lost interest. I had no desire to finish this book. I also don't think that the characters were very well developed at all. They all seemed like very flat characters. I couldn't relate to them, and I certainly didn't sympathize with them. This book is confusing in a lot of ways and Stephenson seems to be rambling and trying to impress the reader with how big his vocabulary is and how smart he is. Reading this book was a big waste of time. It seems like Stephenson couldn't decide whether he wanted to write a fictional book or a non fiction book. <br />I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone and don't really understand why there is so much hype surrounding this book. To Stephenson's credit, the book is fairly easy reading. But I don't think that this book is ENJOYABLE reading, which to me is the first thing a book should be. Someone who is really into Science Fiction might really like this book, but most other readers probably won't. Don't buy into the hype surrounding this book. Skip it.	2001-05-27

Books	5	7	7	N	N	A Book Every Christian Should Read	I recently recieved this book as a gift from the Campus Crusade for Christ staff members on my campus, as a gradution/going away present. I had seen this book at the Christian bookstores, but had never read it myself. I couldn't wait to get back to my room, so I could start reading it. I was up until almost 2 AM because this is one of those books where there is no such thing as a good place to stop. <br />before reading this book, I didn't know much of anything about Bill Bright. I was also curious about how Campus Crusade for Christ got started. <br />This book gave me a new respect for Bill Bright. The biography, Michael Richards was brutally honest. He didn't sugarcoat Bill Bright's weaknesses and shortcomings or portray him as some kind of a super hero. But as I read, I was amazed and humbled by Bill Bright's faith, love for the Lord and also his humility and integrity. <br />I was challenged and inspired by this book. I think that every Christian, regardless of whether they are involved with Campus Crusade for Christ or not, should read this book. If you do, you won't be sorry.	2001-05-06

I found myself laughing throughout the book and could relate to Bridget very well. I love Bridget's wry sense of humor and often bizarre way of looking at life. This is a very lighthearted book and I highly recommend it. I actually read the book after seeing the movie and was surprised to find that the movie sticks pretty close to the book.	2001-04-30
