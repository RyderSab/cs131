People, whether they are Chinese or anything else, get involved in gang activity for a myriad of reasons, none of which are explored with any degree of insight in this book. If you know absolutely nothing about the subject, you might find it useful. But if you're looking for a deeper understanding try anything by Ko-Lin Chin (&quot;Chinatown Gangs&quot;) or &quot;Born to Kill&quot; by T.J. English.	2004-02-23

Hunter may be a proficient professional writer with a commercial following, but this book is... The mob characters are all paper-thin cliche figures. Earl Swagger dominates every physical encounter with the powers of a super hero. The writer takes an interesting subject - Hot Springs - and turns it into cheese. <br />Are all Stephen Hunter's books designed for an adolescent male mentality like this one? This was my first.

With all the books that have been written on the Irish Troubles (Coogan, Bell, Holland, etc), its hard to believe that any new insights or perspectives could be possible, but 'A Secret History' is stunning in this regard. It absorbs all that has been written before and goes deeper, using inside sources in the Republican Movement to offer a view of the Peace Process that is enlightening, to say the least. Gerry Adams, in particular, emerges as a monumental contemporary Irish political figure - cunning, brilliant, ruthless, daring. The story of his engineering an end to the war in Northern Ireland has been told many times, but what is not generally known is that he did so by deliberatly misleading/betraying his own movement. Whether or not you think this is a good thing (it resulted in the Good Friday Accords) is for each individual reader to decide. But the author of this book, Ed Maloney, does a tremendous historical service by giving people a deeper and more informed version of events than anything published so far.	2002-10-21

Holland deserves credit for writing a book that makes the Troubles accessible to readers who really don't know much about it, but I have to say, having read other books on the subject (Coogan, Bell, Moloney) and having followed events in NI for years, I found his analysis too often simplistic and facile, particularly as relates to the recent Peace Process.

Both Bell and Coogan have kept their books in print by issuing &quot;revised&quot; versions every few years. The truth is, neither book was very good to begin with, though Bell's journalism and craftmanship is slightly ahead of Coogan's sloppy, slapdash approach. They both suffer from a similar problem - they seem to be written from a great distance from the subject, more like a series of newspaper reports than a thoughtful, fully realized nonfiction book. Bell's book (or Coogan's for that matter) can't hold a candle to Ed Maloney's &quot;Secret History of the IRA,&quot; which is, quite simply, the definitive account of the IRA, especially in its analysis of Gerry Adams and the Peace Process.	2002-10-10

I was weaned on Chandler and Hammett and James M. Cain and Jim Thompson. I've read all the contemprary guys: Pelecanos, Ellroy, Leonard, etc. As a writer, Pelecanos is as good as any of them, but like many today he relies way too often on the cheapest trick in the book: cartoonish, graphic violence to sustain narrative tension. King Suckerman is a classic example, only here, after many incidents of lurid, sadistic killing we get a moral at the end about personal responsibility. Give me a break. Anyway, like I said, the guy can write (though I could do without the pop culture references on every page). But it is was it is: cartoon crime fiction aimed at an adolescent male mentality, a long way from the adult crime fiction of Chandler and Cain and Thompson.	2002-07-30

I am not an expert on the Mexican Revolution and its aftermath, so I can't really comment on the accuracy of the book, but any reader should know ahead of time that the book is a veritable bloodbath. Villa and his men are portrayed as near psychopaths with only the most simplistic of political motivations.

But unfortunately 'Roscoe' is not a great book - a good book, yes, probably Kennedy's best since 'Ironweed,' but like 'Quinn's Book' and all of the others written since the masterpiece 'Ironweed,' it lacks cohesion and focus. <BR>The details on how the Democratic Machine was run in Albany are quite interesting. And Kennedy is certainly a wonderful and entertaining prose stylist. I just wish he would spend more time constructing a compelling narrative, something to draw the reader into the story in such a way that you care more about the characters.<BR>Unfortunately for Kennedy, everything he writes will be judged in relation to Ironweed, Legs and Billy Phelan's Greatest Game, his origninal Albany cycle. Roscoe is good, but it doesn't exactly stand up to Kennedy's best. On the other hand, Roscoe Conway as a character is a wonderful creation, and I have a suspicion that William Kennedy is not done with him yet.	2002-04-02

It's been classified as a crime novel, but its not really. It's more of a coming-of-age novel about three longtime friends, all of whom have their lives thrown into crisis when one of them is being sent up the river on a seven-year bit. The writing is sharp and thoughtful. The book has the feeling of catching a time and place so well that it may be remembered as a small classic.<br />I see that David Benioff is being promoted in the same manner Jay McInerny was a couple decades back: pretty boy author catches the zeitgeist. Movie offers, etc. Benioff has real talent (maybe McInerney did too once upon a moon). I'm hoping Benioff has more dedication to his craft than McInerney did and that he doesn't get sucked up by the Hollywood machine. He could be a real interesting novelist worth keeping an eye on.	2002-02-06

You may not like it (some readers may be put off by the vulgarity and explicit sexuality), but it stands as a testament to the writer's honesty and artistic courage, and it gives an inside view of an aspect of life in Havana that is unflinching. I've been to Havana. This book depicts a side of the city that the government does its best to make sure no outsiders ever see (and I don't mean this as a political tract against the Castro government -- all governments are solipsistic, including the U.S.). Personally, I found Pedro Juan's writing hard to take at times but also very humanistic and brave. As a novel it's not very satisfying - it's more a series of vignetts. But the writing is colorful, raunchy and hilarious in a down-and-out sort of way. All in all, this is the most important book to come out of Cuba since the writings of Reinaldo Arenas.	2001-08-17

McLaughlin certainly knows his South Brooklyn setting inside-out. And his writing is a lot less cutesy and gimmicky than Lethem's. My only complaint is that the dramatic payoff to the story -- the climax, if we can call it that -- really isn't very satisfying. By the time it arrives the stakes aren't really very high, all of the tension has already been resolved by then, so the ending falls flat. But I still think the characters are very well observed throughout the book. McLaughlin shows a lot of promise as a writer. I hope he has the staying power to follow this up with even more interesting work (a la Richard Price).	2001-07-28

However, the moving and unexpected emotional crisis faced by Easy near the  end was truly heartbreaking. As with all the Easy Rawlins books, author  Walter Mosley has taken the tried-and-true mystery genre and turned it into  a commentary on race and class.

He's written masterpieces (Armies of the Night, Executioner's Song) and there are the great collections of journalism  (Advertisements for Myself, Existential Errands, etc), but let's face it,  he's never written even a good novel, and this one doesn't even come close.  There's a lot of huffing and puffing and certainly some interesting   recreations of the Ancient Egypt, but the book goes nowhere and adds up to  nothing. Norman Mailer needs an enema -- and fast!	1999-12-23

It reads like one of those empty-headed action movies starring Bruce Willis.

The book is written with a lot of heart and soul, and captures the truth of life at the street level as well as Miguel Pinero or Richard Price. My only  complaint is that it is terribly overwritten in places. Back off, Little  Brother, let your characters breath and let the story do the work. You  don't need to sweat so much showing off your prose.	1999-12-23
US	50819793	R3C4G6VCED70T5	0395825229	912059336	The City Below	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Definitely worthwhile	James Carroll is such a thoughtful writer that I wish I could give this book a higher rating, but it lacks punch when it comes to the criminal underworld aspect of the story. Carroll certainly knows Boston, especially  Boston politics, and he knows the workings of the Cathlolic church inside  out, and he captures the relationship between the Doyle brothers in a way  that will be recognizable to any Irish American. But the criminal stuff is  garden-variety crime fiction, written from a great distance. A pity. This  is a good book that could have been a great one with a little more grit.	1999-12-22

It reads like a long newspaper article, not a book. There is no emotional connection to the material on the part of the  author.

The best thing about it -- the hard-boiled atmosphere -- seems derived from all the obvious sources (Hammett, Ellroy, etc). Its loaded with cliches about the Irish and  Irish Americans.

Since I consider myself one, I slogged through this book, which touches on all the well known mafia hits, etc. written about in dozens of  other books and magazine articles.

It's written in the style of &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; and should appeal to  readers of all ages. Quite a triumph for the author, if he himself made a  journey like this (it seems that he must have, given the knowing detail).	1999-12-21

Miller combines solid leg-work with intellect and compassion, and gives an accurate overview of Cuba today. I recently travelled to Cuba and I read  Miller's book twice, once before I went and again after I returned, and it  was worthwhile on both occassions. P.S.

What ever happened to good non-fiction book writing based on multiple sources, research, etc. People should know that  the two FBI agents who put this book together (using a ghostwriter,  probably) were fired by the Bureau for using confidential FBI information  and for inaccurately glorifying their own roles in the  investigation.

The characters are not compelling or even particularly believable. Tosches shows off his writing skills, but to what end? The book has no overriding theme. And the  Asian characters are all inscrutible Chinese, apparantly beyond the scope  of the author's understanding. He does better with the Italian mafiosi, of  course, well worn characters from a million other books and movies. a  talented writer, obviously, but the book's a dud.	1999-12-14

Every bit of information in here is second and third hand -- from newspaper articles, mostly, that were themselves based on law  enforcement sources, people far removed from the events they describe. This  book reveals not one single insight about the man it is supposed to be  about. On top of all that, this book is sloppy -- it reads as if it were  quickly thrown together to capitalize on the Gotti media blitz, of which  Jerry Capeci, Gene Mustain and others have been living off for at least the  last ten years. Move on, gentlemen. the mafia is dead.	1999-12-14

Reader beware: this book is told shamelessly from the law enforcement point of view, and therefore lacks credibility. Believe it or not, not all FBI agents are saints and heroes. they are, after all, human -- and like  most humans they tend to engage in self-aggrandizement, which the author  falls for hook, line and sinker.

It probably would have been better if it were at least two hundred pages shorter -- tighter and more focused. It's certainly an  impressive foray into the cultural history and mindset of the CIA, but I  would ask all of the reviewers that have given it five stars: Thematically  speaking, what, ultimately, is it about? The book has no unifying theme and  therefore does not coelesce with the power of a great novel.	1999-12-14

In a way, the author tries to do too much by bringing the story into the late-60's,  tacking on a political coda that doesn't fit the earlier tone of the book.

The photo's are interesting (if unspectacular) and Codrescu's take on Cuba is unique, given his Romanian communist background. But this is very much a book of &quot;impressions,&quot; not scholarship. The author repeats erroneous  cliches about Cuba (about how homosexuals are treated, for one -- see  &quot;Machos, Maricones, and Gays: Cuba and Homosexuality) without ever  explaining or exploring them. He spends too much time on the colorful  surface, i.e. santeria, cigars, all the available &quot;pu**y.&quot; On the  other hand, he's a talented writer, so if you've never been to Cuba and are  planning to go, &quot;Ay, Cuba&quot; is not a bad place to start.	1999-12-13

But the author's depiction of the black underclass is definitely  an outsider's view, cliched verging on racist. I have no problem per se  with white writers creating black characters (or vice versa), but the proof  is in the pudding. You can either do it convincingly, with insight and  compassion, or you can't. This writer can't (or at least he doesn't in this  book).	1999-12-06

Alright, no problem. If you're going to &quot;borrow,&quot; might as well borrow from the best. But the author expends too much energy on trying to impress the  reader with the quality of his prose and not enough on characterization.  I'm impressed, however, with the scope of his knowledge oncultural matters  relating to the Carribbean -- he obviously knows his subject. A good book,  but next time, Bob, lighten up on the literary pyrotechnics. Go back and  read G. Greene and you'll be reminded how simply and eloquently he states  his case.	1999-11-26

There's no great insights on human nature or society. Read  &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; by Capote or &quot;The Executioner's Song&quot;  by Mailer. Even &quot;The Westies,&quot; a true-life mob book by T.J.  English, is far superior to this.

When are caucasian writers going to stop calling themselves &quot;bold&quot; and &quot;daring&quot; when they &quot;lift the curtain&quot; on Chinatown?  Stop all the self-congratulation. This is a book written from the point of  view of an OUTSIDER, which is okay, but let's call it what it is. Read  &quot;The New Chinatown&quot; by Peter Kwong or &quot;Born to Kill&quot; by  T.J.
