Reminiscent of The Twilight Zone and told in both text and graphic novel format, How to Disappear Completely and Never Be Found is a surprisingly fun read. The story is quite complex, but the quirky characters help usher the book along. The one thing this book might have benefited from is a character list as sometimes it's hard to keep track of the story. Nevertheless, HtDCaNBF was very satisfying and fun to read.	2003-04-13

When Lou is given the choice to undergo treatment to become &quot;normal&quot;, he must decide whether to venture into the unknown, or remain his familiar, but flawed, self.<br />Elizabeth Moon is a mother of an autistic child herself, and you can tell she knows the condition inside and out by the way she tells her story from the viewpoint of an autist. The Speed of Dark poses the question: How much would you do to become normal and accepted? How much would you sacrifice of your true self? And then Ms. Moon sets out to answer that question in the guise of Lou Arrendale, who is at once likable yet, at times, infuriating. The book is exhausting to read - I can't imagine how exhausting it must be to live with autism! And at the end of the book, we are given some answers... but also left with one final question: What, exactly, is normal?	2003-04-13

Guardians of the Flame is the story of a group of college students who, while playing a game of Dungeons and Dragons (or its fictional equivalent), are transported to the world in which their game is played, and are trapped there until they find the Gate Between the Worlds.<br />What can I say, I have fallen in love with this series! It is the novel every RPG geek has dreamed about. The characters are funny - though some are slightly more one-dimensional than others - and the adventures the group has are action-packed. I'm currently reading book 4 and, while the action is a bit bogged down by some political situations the characters have gotten in to, I can tell the series is going to become one of my favorites.	2003-04-13

This novel is very short and concisely written, yet manages to convey a world of emotions. The ending, in particular, is very well written and plausible.

Jodee Blanco writes a heart-breaking autobiography about growing up as the target of school bullies. Smart and kind, Jodee became the favorite punching bag of bullies throughout elementary, middle, and high school, and only as an adult did she become successful and happy.<br />This book was especially hard for me to read. While I never had to endure the intensity of bullying that Ms. Blanco had to, I, too, was a target of school bullies. And like Ms. Blanco, I thought I'd put it all behind me - until I struggled to read Please Stop Laughing At Me, and found myself reliving memories I'd rather forget. Though this book was hard to read, it was definitely worth it. If you've ever been a target of bullies, consider this book part therapy as it will definitely prompt you to work through some issues. I only wish I could give a copy of this book to anyone who ever called me names or pushed me or stole my clothes during gym. This book should be required reading in school - it is a cautionary tale that shows we, as a society, should never, ever again say that bullying is just \\"kids being kids.\\"	2003-04-13

While Lucy does get to indulge in her every dream, we get to see, by the end, the consequences she has to pay for her actions. Realistically written, Lucy the Giant is filled with flawed characters and authentic dialogue. The already engrossing story is made even better by the setting of the Pacific Northwest - Sheri Smith paints a picture of a stark, but beautiful Alaska and the danger and excitement of the sea just as well as she evokes the emotions and actions of her characters.

I didn't expect to like it nearly as much as I did. From the very first chapter I found myself sucked in to the story and caught up in the action. I read in disbelief as Semi and Miranda learned of what was to happen to them. The book moves very quickly and, though the subject the book deals with is highly unbelievable, Ann Halam manages to write a very realistic - and horrifying - story of genetic engineering. I could seriously have nightmares after reading this book! The ending, I thought, was left a little bit open... so maybe we can look forward to sequels? Let's hope so!	2003-04-13

The author of the charming World of Pies returns with a story set in the 20s, 30s, and 40s, about twin girls - Fanny and Sue. Narrating every other chapter, Fanny and Sue alternate in telling the story of their life, the relationship they have as sisters, and their hopes and dreams of the future.<br />Reading this book made me long to live in Fanny and Sue's world for just one day, to experience what it was like in that era and what it was like to live with a \\"cookie cutter\\" family - mom and dad, two girls, and a boy. Fanny and Sue's life was, however, far from perfect, but the two weathered their hardships together and stayed best friends even through the betrayals and jealousies typical of sibling rivalry. Make sure when reading this book you have a blanket, burning candles, soft music, a purring cat, and something good to eat and drink - the book is pure indulgence and should only be read while pampering oneself.	2003-04-13

His essays and short stories are usually humorous and enjoyable. However, Holidays on Ice proved to be the exception. This was an audio edition of four of Sedaris' essays/stories about Christmas. While the first story about a department store elf was marginally funny, the rest were horrendous. Sedaris' normally charming narration was grating and whiney and while I did listen to the very end, I honestly wish I hadn't. Perhaps this one would be better if read, rather than listened to, but I think not. I'm not a fan of the Christmas holidays and, seemingly, neither is Sedaris, but his stories didn't prove amusing - they were just annoying.	2003-04-13

It reads like a Michael Crichton novel and smacks of a blockbuster movie with way too many CGI characters in our future. Despite that, however, The Contest is a highly enjoyable read, though the premise of hardly believable. But if you're looking for a good book to curl up with on a rainy day - or something to take with you to the beach this summer - The Contest is definitely a book worth checking out. Suspend your reality for a day, and give it a try. However, I'll take a moment to mention this is the only Matthew Reilly novel I would recommend. I attempted to read his other novels after reading this one and found them all to be stale and boring.	2003-04-13

His parents were killed in an accident and he now lives with his uncle, the very boring Ian Rider, who works at a bank and values safety above all else. It is because of this last fact that Alex is baffled when he is visited by the police and learn his uncle was killed in a car accident. After meeting up with Ian's boss - and getting some very weird vibes from him - Alex determines to find out what really happened to his uncle. To start with, Alex goes to the wrecking yard where his uncle's car was taken. Expecting to find nothing but a mass of mangled metal, Alex is astonished to find his uncle's care in pristine condition - except for the bullet holes riddling the side. Before he can investigate further, Alex is captured and knocked out. When he awakens, he finds his uncle's boss waiting for him, and the truth comes out: Ian Rider was a secret agent for British Intelligence. Using blackmail, Ian's boss convinces Alex to take over his uncle's investigation and discover the reason Ian Rider was murdered. Equipped with a false identity and some super cool toys (among them: a yo-yo that has nylon thread that can hold up to 200 pounds and clips to a belt, a tube of zit cream that will eat through metal, and a game boy that doubles as a fax machine, listening device, and camera), Alex begins his new assignment as a secret agent.<br />That was what happened in the first 70 pages of Stormbreaker. The rest of the book was just as fast paced and exciting! A cross between James Bond, Agent Cody Banks and Alias, Stormbreaker sets your heart racing in the very first chapter. Alex Rider already has a series going for him - Stormbreaker is only the first in the series; the second came out last year and the third is being released soon. I wouldn't be surprised if this one shows up on the big screen, but don't wait until then - go get the book now and buckle up for a wild ride.	2003-04-13

The night of the Romanov's brutal massacre, Leonka was sent away, never to be seen again.

In Q is for Quarry, Grafton returns to her character, California P.I. Kinsey Millhone.  Set sometime during the 80s (I think - I've never quite been sure what decade Grafton is writing in), Kinsey is enlisted by two retired cops to revisit an 18-year-old mystery: the murder of a young Jane Doe that was never solved and continues to haunt the investigators on the case.  Intermingled with the mystery are vignettes of Kinsey's private life, including her stormy relationship with her relatives, a visit with her neighbor, and personal conversations with the Con Dolan and Stacey Oliphant, the two retired police officers working the case with her.<br />Sue Grafton has, indeed, done it again - unfortunately.  I suppose it's understandable that, after 17 letters of the alphabet, the format is going to get tired, but I'm still highly disappointed in this installment of the Millhone series.  The \\"mystery\\" is boring.  Kinsey has become preachy.  When she's not doing detective work, she's busy preaching to both Dolan and Oliphant about their unhealthy lifestyles.  I could see from the beginning of the book that Dolan would end up in the hospital with heart problems - Grafton just about nailed up a neon sign that screamed it throughout the book.  Kinsey's dry wit and cynical view on life is no longer amusing, and her detective skills, when compared to some other perennial favorite characters like Stephanie Plum, Goldy Schulz, and J. P. Beaumont, are no longer impressive.  Kinsey, still stuck living in the 80s, has long been surpassed by far more interesting and better written books.  Sorry, Ms. Grafton, I just don't know if I can stick out the rest of the alphabet with you.<br />Note: The mystery is, in fact, based on a real unsolved case that Grafton has managed to reopen.  However, Grafton's fictional solution to the case is ultimately unsatisfying and uncreative.  While basing the book on a real case will help her hype factor, it does nothing for me.  It only makes the book more unpleasant - I don't really like reading about a real murder victim... I can turn on the news any day and hear about those.re unpleasant - I don't really like reading about a real murder victim... I can turn on the news any day and hear about those.	2002-10-27

While trying to keep from being found out by a private detecive (hired by Aunt Esther), Scippio and his gang are asked to pull off a major job - with some major secrets - that will leave them richer than they could ever imagine... but at what price?<br />The Thief Lord has been hailed as the \\"next Harry Potter\\" - which seems to be the case of almost every children's book coming out these days.  But I disagree.  The Thief Lord can not even compare to Harry Potter because they aren't even in the same genre!  While it has been called a fantasy, The Thief Lord is, at its heart, an adventure - a modern Oliver Twist.  Venice gives the book an old world flavor that is delightful and magical.  Young readers are sure to delight in the ways the Thief Lord's gang outsmarts the adults and triumphs in their quest and readers of ALL ages will have a ball with this book.

In a fit of insanity, Leo takes Bree hostage and plans to kill her, but when he and Bree begin to talk, he finds his saving grace.<br />Ellen Wittlinger, author of Razzle and Hard Love, tackles a tough subject with this book and pulls it off quite well.  The story itself is very short - just over 100 pages long.  Almost the entire book is dialogue, and it takes place in only a couple settings.  It's a quick read, but rather grim material.  If you're looking for a happy ending, don't read this one!

From there on out, Will's life is never the same.<br />\\"About a Boy\\" is one of those typical British novels, complete with British sarcasm and wit.  The story, while original, failed to excite me very much.  Though there were parts that were entertaining, they were buried beneath meaningless and boring fluff.  Obviously we were meant to dislike Will - and I did - but I don't know that we were meant to dislike every other character - but I *did*.

Ever since Bridget Jones hit it big, the publishing industry has been flooding the market with British novels written by young, bright-eyed Brits who are terribly funny and slightly pretentious.  What was original and fun in Bridget Jones is now stale and preachy in I Don't Know How She Does It.<br />Kate Reddy is a working mother who juggles a demanding career in the stock market industry, raising her two young children, and trying to be a good wife to her husband.  The few funny moments of this book are overshadowed by Kate's frenetic pace.  I was literally exhausted just reading this book.  Interwoven with her busy schedule is Kate's - and Allison Pearson's, probably - views on motherhood, children, and husbands.  Perhaps, as a childfree person, I am not the target audience for this one.  I, for one, am slightly offended by the author's implications.  The moral of the story, as far as I could see was: Women are nothing without children and men are nothing without women.  Two gross statements that are so untrue it's not even funny.  I kept on reading this one in hopes of finding one humorous morsel in a book being hyped as the Bridget Jones for the working married woman (now I know why good, old Bridget calls them \\"dull marrieds\\"), but found myself hating each and every one of the characters in this book (except, perhaps, for the man trying to coerce Kate into an affair - the novel would have been decidedly more interesting if she had gone ahead with the affair).  I just didn't care by the end of it, and was thoroughly disgusted with how the novel wrapped up.  Kate, having decided that children are the \\"meaning of life\\", leaves her career and spends her days in her new country home, thinking sad, sympathetic thoughts about her co-worker, Momo, who is \\"terribly naive\\" because she doesn't want children (gasp)!  Take it from me, this book may by the \\"it\\" book of the season, but it's a waste of your money - there are better books out there, and better authors.  I hope Ms. Pearson decides that she is better off raising her children instead of writing.Ms. Pearson decides that she is better off raising her children instead of writing.	2002-10-27

Tree earned his nickname because he is tall and solid, like a Tree - he's 12 years old, 6'3\\" and still growing.  However, life in Tree's world isn't so solid these days.  His parents have divorced and his beloved grandfather - a Vietnam vet - just had his leg amputated.  Tree compares his life to a war, but finds a way to work through his problems with advice from his grandpa and help from his new friend, a quirky girl named Sophie.<br />Joan Bauer is a perennial favorite of mine and is always guaranteed to make me think.  This novel, which talks both about everyday life and war, is quite timely considering the turmoil our country is in.  The one passage that struck me the most is this one:<br />\\"I think important things are worth fighting for, but there's nothing glorious about battle, nothing cool about holding a gun.  It's scary and lonely and too many people die young.  Never be a person who wants war - hate it with everything you've got.  But if you've got to fight to protect people, try to do your job the best you know how.  Protecting people is the only reason to ever fight.\\"<br />Those words were spoken by Tree's grandfather, and it summed up my feelings about war perfectly - sometimes necessary, but *never* good.  Food for thought.  All in all, Stand Tall is a wonderful book that tackles real life problems and offers real life solutions.  For young readers that are confused about what to feel these days, Stand Tall would be a perfect book for them to read - perhaps they will find some of the answers they were looking for.	2002-10-27

The topics tackled in This Lullaby are written both believably and in an utterly unique way, so that an old problem - \\"What do you do when someone doesn't like you back?\\" - becomes a fresh, new story with an ending that will satisfy both romantics and cynics alike.	2002-08-26

One evening he discovers a woman hiding in his bathroom closet. The woman - Lauren - is surprised Arthur can see and hear her. She tells Arthur that her physical body is in a coma and has been for six months. Her \\"spirit\\" was somehow separated from her body. Arthur doesn't believe her at first, but pays a visit to the hospital and finds her body. They get to know each other better and soon fall in love, but it doesn't last long. Lauren learns that her body is to be disconnected from the feeding tube and she will die. Arthur promises to help save her and that's when the fun begins...<br />This book is very well-written. It reminded me of \\"Message in a Bottle\\" by Nicholas Sparks. The writing style and the story are both very similar, although \\"If Only It Were True\\" is not as tragic as \\"Message.\\" It's a very quick read - just over 200 pages long. I devoured it in an evening. Even if you're not a fan of romances, you should still try this one. It's sweet and guaranteed to leave a smile on your face, but it's not so full of sap that you will feel ill afterwards. There is a very interesting sub-plot concerning Arthur's mother; I would have almost liked to read more about it, but there was just enough to explain things and not so much that it overshadowed the actual story. The only problem with the book is that the character of Lauren wasn't nearly as well-developed as the character of Arthur. This is a minor point and you don't notice it much while reading it. \\"If Only It Were True\\" is a perfect summer read, so run to your local library and find a copy!	2002-07-28
US	51820091	R3CDAXJ7KCR0PA	0316666343	784206304	The Lovely Bones	Books	5	2	2	N	N	The Lovely Bones is a lovely surprise.	Susie Salmon (like the fish) narrates this well-written, suspenseful novel from Heaven. Susie begins her story by telling of her death at the hands of a deceptively mild-mannered neighbor. From there, she travels back through moments of her past, interspersed with glimpses of her family and friends while they are coping with her death.<br />Susie's Heaven resembles her hometown high school, where she only has to attend art class and there are swings outside with the \\"good seats.\\" Anything she wants in Heaven, she just has to imagine. But the one thing she truly wants - to be alive and together with her family once again - she can never have. Instead, she observes her family over a period of ten years as they grow older and continue living without her.<br />The Lovely Bones grabs your interest from the very first page, and holds it throughout with a story that is both charming and melancholy. The characters become well-loved as the novel proceeds and you will be sorry to see them go when you turn the last page. Alice Sebold is truly a new author to watch.	2002-07-28

Mai is a young Chinese girl who, after having her feet bound and being forced into marrying an abusive man, runs away to a Shanghai brothel. It is there that she meets her future husband, Arthur, a man involved in the &quot;Foot Emancipation Society&quot; (dedicated to stopping the foot-binding tradition) until, that is, he becomes obsessed with Mai's feet. They marry and move in with Arthur's sister and brother-in-law and their children.<br />Reading this novel is almost like looking at a magnificent painting. Kathryn Harrison weaves her words together like a true artist. The tale jumps back and forth between &quot;present time&quot; (early to mid-1900s), when Mai is struggling with depression and her niece - who is closer to a daughter to her - has been shipped off to boarding school, to the past, where Mai's life story is recounted. At first, the jumping around can be a little confusing, but once you catch the rhythm of the novel, it flows smoothly until the surprising end.<br />If you're looking for a novel that'll make you think, pick up The Binding Chair and enjoy.	2002-07-28
US	51820091	R3U4H809K3Y4WO	0345448987	737112991	Regina's Song	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Original, but with a few flaws.	Unlike many of the reviewers here, I have never reading David or Leigh Eddings before reading \\"Regina's Song.\\"  While I am a fan of fantasy, Eddings just hadn't grabbed my interest yet.  However, the plot of \\"Regina's Song\\" sounds intriguing.<br />The book started out very quickly.  The first 20 or so years in the twins' lives were summed up in a couple of paragraphs.  I, for one, would have enjoyed reading more about their past.  \\"Regina's Song,\\" however, does not continue the frenetic pace.  Immediately after the murder of Regina, the book slows to a snail's pace.  While the plot is interesting and the dialogue very well-written, I felt that some of the book was \\"padded\\" too much and many of the meaningless conversations could have been left out.  The last 100 pages, however, made up for the slow pace as it once again takes off like a racehorse.  The ending, while completely unbelievable, was satisfying.<br />My biggest beef with \\"Regina's Song\\" is the author's tendency to ramble on about subjects that didn't connect with the plot.  I have a feeling that I was reading quite a few of David or Leigh Edding's _personal_ opinions about current events and issues.  Also, the main characters dislike of Milton, and his many declarations of such, was utterly pointless.<br />\\"Regina's Song\\" was, by the end, a decent thriller.  The plot was original.  But this is not a book to read *in depth* - skimming it would suffice, and then you could skip over all the meaningless parts.	2002-07-28
US	51820091	RIPOFAZSVW1Y7	0743418727	194962038	Perfect Match: A Novel	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Jodi Picoult, a treasure of an author!	Assistant District Attorney Nina Frost has seen the pain and humiliation children go through when they are sexually abused. She has tried - and won - many cases. Never in a million years did she expect to be on the other side of a child abuse case, but when her five-year-old son, Nathaniel, suddenly stops talking one day, it is discovered - through therapy and medical examination - that he has been sexually molested. Through sign language, Nathaniel is able to identify his abuser as the family priest, and Nina finds her life turned even more upside down. Faced with an attorney's knowledge of how sex abuse cases often turn out, Nina does the unthinkable and takes the law into her own hands.<br />Since 1992, with her debut of Songs of the Humpback Whale, Jodi Picoult has written a string of gripping novels about the gray areas of life. She portrays both sides of a story without pointing a finger at once side and labeling it as \\"bad.\\" Her characters are engaging, complicated, and realistically flawed. In Perfect Match, Jodi Picoult takes a story that has dominated the headlines recently and gives it an altogether different spin. The things left unsaid in the story encourage the reader to think and question just exactly what is right and what is wrong. The courtroom scenes, as in all of Picoult's past novels, are well-written - realistic, but never boring.<br />Perfect Match keeps you guessing to the very last page, and leaves you gasping in surprise.	2002-05-27
US	51820091	R21SM5DJOUVW9M	0395689856	673968030	Letters from the Inside	Books	5	8	9	N	N	The one that started it all.	Ten years ago I discovered a copy of John Marsden's Letters from the Inside at my Library.  I took it out because I was big into writing pen pals at that time in my life and thought it might be a good book.  That one book started a lifelong love of John Marsden's writing.<br />Letters from the Inside is one of the most chilling books I have ever read.  I've read it three or four times in the last ten years and in each read-through, I discover one more facet of the story that I've missed.  The book itself, taken at face value, is not so chilling - it's what your mind creates to fill in the spaces that Marsden leaves in his story.  What did Tracey do to end up where she is?  What happened to Mandy?  What happened to her family?  Who marked &quot;return to sender&quot; on the letters?  Will Tracey ever find out what happened to Mandy?  Will Tracey ever make it back into the real world?  The mind creates the darkest scenarios to those questions.<br />It takes a special kind of writer to make a story work with the &quot;cliffhanger&quot; ending.  Any other writer and I'd probably have chucked the book at the wall in frustration.  Part of me wishes there was a sequel to this book so that I could find out what happens next... and part of me knows that a sequel to the story wouldn't be possible.<br />Everyone should own this book.  Or if not this one, then one of Marsden's other books.  Tomorrow, When the War Began is amazing as well.  I would place John Marsden at the top of my favorite author list any day, and no matter how old I get (I'm 22 now and still reading him!), I don't think that will change.	2001-11-25
US	51820091	R2LPXV9PVTONR3	0312266626	810049197	The Dog Who Spoke with Gods	Books	5	22	23	N	N	For anyone who has ever loved a dog...	... and for those who haven't.  This book is for everyone.  If you've never loved a dog, you will not be able to read this book without emerging a changed person, and if you already love dogs, you will empathize with the views written about in this book, and it will also change you.<br />The Dog Who Spoke With Gods spoke to me on such a powerful level.  It reaffirmed all that I have believed in and more.  This might sound stupid since it is fiction, but it has changed my life in a million subtle ways.  I could relate to everything in the book, but even though Jessup only wrote what I have always believed it was... more.  It was magical.<br />Do yourself a favor and order this book, you won't regret it.  Read it, then share it with friends.  In this time of great tragedy, you may find comfort in this story about horrendous acts done in the name of science and medicine and about the brave hero who triumphs.  And while you are reading it, please take great care to think about the beliefs talked about in the book.  The message that Jessup is trying to get across is so important, and so beautiful.  I wish I could walk right up to Ms. Jessup and hug her and thank her for the wonderful story she has given the world.	2001-09-13

When I picked up this book I didn't even know who Lillian Hellman was, but I was eager to read a &quot;horror&quot; story about how awful she was to poor Rosemary Mahoney.  Through the first half of the book I was wondering  when the bad stuff would start to happen and I only read the second half  because I was hoping Lillian would hit Rosemary upside the head with  something!  Rosemary Mahoney was obviously a spoiled brat of a child if she  expected to be hired to work somewhere and then not be expected to actually  work!  And then when Lillian enforced her rules - albeit strict rules - she  suddenly became a &quot;monster.&quot;  Since reading this book, I've  learned more about Lillian Hellman and I've come to quite like her.  Yes,  she was eccentric, difficult, paranoid, but she was not a monster and  Rosemary Mahoney was not treated cruelly.  I hope that in writing this  book, Mahoney got out all her bitterness and can finally stop sulking!	2000-05-16
