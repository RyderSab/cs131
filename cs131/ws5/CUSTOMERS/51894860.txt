It was the biography of Bob through his jokes.  It was really funny and well done.  The cool thing about it was going through each stage and found the 10 year jokes were just great.  If you ever watched Forest Gump then this is what it was like for me.  There were things happening during each stage that Bob joked about that told the story of the time but also about how people lived during those times.  Great book.	2005-02-24

Your relationships matter most, with you family and your friends.  This books talks about Morrie, the author's college professor.  I think Morrie loved Mitch a lifetime before Mitch finally came around.  This is one of the few books that made me happy and made me weep with tears and sobbing at the same time.  Mitch goes to Morrie's house when he finds out that Morrie has ALS and visits every Tuesday out of his busy schedule.  Morrie is a hero.  Mitch learns many of life's lessons at the bedside of Morrie.  Human dignity was never greater than recorded here in this book.  A must read for those with ill loved ones and to those who need a purpose to this life.	2005-01-15

The author does a really nice job talking about network hacks.  He sounds like he still hacks into networks on the side since the book contains so much information.  The book is not exhaustive (no book can be about this subject) but covers the most important topics about hacking and security.  If you want a good introduction with _some_ depth to it this is the book.  It's good book to start with if you haven't read anything else.  It's a fun read with some good points.  After this, you'll want to buy other security books that go into a specific area with a lot of depth to it.  Maybe you could go into the specific Hacking Exposed books on Windows or Linux, etc.  Definitely should be part of your library.	2005-01-14

Over a year on a floating piece of ice would drive anyone mad.  These 28 just endured the most terrifying thing anyone could ever experience - being alone in the antarctic with no contact with the rest of the world.  How would it be to be so isolated that no one knows where you are and if you died wouldn't know it for years.  Shackleton is the pillar of optimism to be optimistic in circumstances that would have broke even some of the best men today.  This author has done a great job deriving the story from the surviving documents and journals of those that survived it.  It is truly a story that will endure many generations of us.	2005-01-14

I haven't seen the movie, but I don't usually read children's books, but these I can't put down.  I even read on the toilet at 1 in the morning.  So depressing but yet the kids are so resiliant.  This author is so clever and so funny.  The picture of the author on the back inside flap is his humor.  It's not a portrait!  Does this book end happy, probably not, but that's what is so drawing about this book, what mess can those kids get into and think of a way to get out?  But do they really get out of trouble, they just get out of the frying pan and into the fire.   Just think Murphy's Law.	2005-01-14

Why are fighting the war in Iraq?  We are fighting the enemies that have supplied the terrorists with, not WMD, but millions of tons of small arms that are killing our troops.  Who are we really fighting?  China, Russia, France, Germany and of course, the enemy that is selling is out from within.  Like other reviewers have said, we need to wake up!!!  Gertz tells us who are enemies are and we need to quit feeding their bad habits.  I don't know how this will take place but we feed one of them by visiting those dollar stores.   This is one read that will shock you and show you who the real terrorists are.	2005-01-14

I enjoyed every page.  She gets right down to the point and jabs the virtual screwdriver into the liberal back.  Every word just is twist of the metal and \\"ouch\\" to the left.  If you are a lefty, boy, watch out, you will come away incensed and stymied, especially when she talks about how liberals hate the religious.  Oh, my.  How can the media be the way they?  Ann has the proof - over 35 PAGES of references to newspaper articles, internet web pages and plenty of books.  She refers to lexus-nexus over and over as a resource for her arguments on how the left and the media continues to bash the president and conservative values.   References and proof are what we lack most in all of the mass media propaganda that we can shoved down our throats on a daily basis.  Good going Ann!  What a contrast!	2005-01-14

He was the man.  Noonan, gave us something that we rarely get to see in a president, his character, which is rare these days.   Noonan, did a great job mixing present day events with Reagan day events so we could see the man for who he was, great.  He was funny.  He was stearn.  He fought communism.  He was caring.  He loved people.  He was smart.  He was a leader.  He could be angry but no condescending.  He was fearless.  He was/is an American and Americans should be thought of.

If you like Kerry, you don't want to read this book.  The people who wrote this book backup every comment and accusation with extensive documentation and quotes and most of them from John Kerry himself.  The authors waste no time with rhetoric or selfish egrandizement.  They just tell the truth and back it with proof.  What more can we say?  Most of the time you might think, \\"This can't be real!\\", but the proof is in the reference documentation and the many testimonies from multiple sources.  We might have to bring this book back out in '08 if Kerry decides to run again.	2005-01-14

The photographs provide the proof of who these spectacular men were.  Frank Hurley makes it more real than any words could describe.  As you look at the photos you realize the beauty but also the desolateness of where they were.  There was nothing there!  Blue sky or white snow, with occasional grey clouds.  Three colors to live with for over a year.  There are beautiful portraits, animal photos and great shots of the ship that could have done the job, but sadly didn't.  Amazing, truly amazing.

I'm not a tolkien, the man, fan, myself, I just like the books he wrote.  It was short enough to keep me interested and didn't go into tolkien worship.  He was a man just like any of us.  White didn't go into intense depth like some of the other authors, who border on tolkien worship.  This book is for those who want to skim his life, his associations, like C.S. Lewis, his wife, etc., to see who he really is really quickly and go on.  The few supposed 'errors' as some other reviewers put it, are completely outweighed by the many facts put forth by the author that paint the picture as it is done in other works, but at 30,000 feet.  Like I said before if you want more depth and concise tolkien history go to some other book.	2005-01-14

Hannity is better at commentating on radio and TV, but for a political commentator it's pretty good.  It makes you realize that there are two sides and that one side is trying to blur the lines.  Let's not let that happen. <br /> <br />I like how he starts us with history, especially how Chamberlain was such an appeaser.  This is paralleled today by many of the liberals in Washington today.  How sad and how pathetic!  It amazes me that there are people that hate our own country, that there are people that think you can be nice to a vicious snake.  I guess that is possible since there are people that hate their good parents.  Let's slap the hand that feeds you, just like liberals slap the nation that allows them to speak.  Hannity explains to us how liberalism is putting us at risk here and our soldiers abroad.  Read it for yourself then ask yourself if there are not people out in the world that are trying to kill us.  There are.	2005-01-14

It does have a few swear words that would be harsh for young readers to handle but, hey, it's a book about a military guy, that's been there for 30 years or more and so what do you expect.   <br /> <br />Some of my favorite parts of the book is when he talks about his father and what a pillar of strength he was in his life.  We would do well to learn from our fathers like that and to be fathers like that.  True values that endure.   <br /> <br />Also, some of the intense battles that General Franks was in as a Viet Nam vet were just like being there.  War is hell and he survived it well.  He was wounded and kept going back in there.  The epitome of a soldier.	2005-01-14

It shows how he came out of that chaos by two big events.  First by meeting Laura and then second, meeting the Lord.  There is a humility in Bush that makes him approachable and more real than some of our previous presidents.  This book portrays that so well.  It brought peace of conscience and a sense of hope that our country has a chance to do good in the face of evil.	2005-01-14

I took it to work.  Read it before work.  Read it at lunch time.  Read it after work.  Read it through dinner and to bed for two days.  The writing is not pretty.  It is written in unflowery language and sounds like a journal, which, to me, makes it taste, feel, and sound authentic, real and powerful.  It makes you sick, happy, sad, horrified, terrified, nervous, anxious, tired, joyful, and thankful.  I've never felt all of these emotions in such a short book.  I savored every word and reread passages that just astonished me.  This is a book and tale that will live on with Slavomir's memory.  I myself spent 2 years in a foreign land, went through many hardships and joyful events.  I can understand that when the event is over with, you don't want to revisit it because it is a blessed and horrific event that you have tackled and experienced.

I laughed every time I read that phrase, but then it got a little bit tiresome to read the phrase over and over.  Savage puts it plainly.  What do you want, a cookie?  He says it like it is.  Pulls no punches.  Doesn't hold back.   The ideas are great.  He gets a little too radical and obnoxious in some places but makes up for it in others with his wit and humor.  I like how he metaphorizes things to make it understandable for people like me who don't necessarily read a hoard of books.  I prefer reading computer manuals and technical articles, but this was a good read.  We need to think what we are doing to ourselve in America.  I love how he talks about his mother and father.  They were hard working Americans with values, good values, family values.  Savage has these same values.  We need these values for our society.  What more can I say?    We should take these things to heart.  It will be our own fault if things get worse in this great country, not just our leaders.  We voted them in.  We should take responsibility and take a stand for ourselves, our freedoms and the rights that we take for granted.  Get off our duffs and do something.  This book can give us some great motivation to do that.	2004-01-07

I don't agree with everything he says, but most things are dead on.  I don't agree with his educational ideas and I do agree that the liberal democrats are way too far to the left.  I really like his penatent attitude about himself, which shows his humility and that people can change their views no matter what political pressure there is.  This guy and this book is part of what America needs - good solid ideas and a national push for patriotism, not governmental greed and irresponsibility.
