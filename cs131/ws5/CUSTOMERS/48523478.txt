The book is very detailed and details are important for the historian's point of view. On the other hand, sometimes too many details can be boring. Please do not pick up the book expecting great thrills and excitement, or you will be disappointed. Still, reading details about the life of this outlaw and gambler, which turned good guy and loyal friend to the Earp clan, certainly has interesting moments. If you are into the wild west, it is worth your time.	2005-10-10

Matt wasn't quite equipped for the task, but through difficult circumstances he finds himself being helped greatly by an Indian family. A boy about his age slowly becomes his friend as Matt slowly fits into the Indian culture. I'll not give away the ending, but you will be surprised to see how Matt finally gains respect of the Indians. Your kids will enjoy this book!	2005-10-10

The Great Turkey Walk is fiction, but based on actual occurences from the old west. When a very slow student finally gets his walking papers, he enters into an enterprise nobody else would have ever considered. The enterprise? Herding Turkeys to the Gold rush of Denver! His slow and difficult trip brings many adventures his way. He meets his long lost father, who desparately tries to steal his turkeys. He is surrounded by Indians. He meets a half crazed girl who becomes the love of his life. In the end, the dumb boy turns out to be smarter than he even thought he could be. It is a delight and my kids loved the book. Yours will too!	2005-10-10

This book had it's moments, but it would have been better if they would have given more of a chronological history. Instead, she jumps around from story to story, as each one pops into her head. This made things a little confusing for me. I did feel like she had an ulterior motive for writing the book. That motive was to get back at her daughter for a nasty book she had written about Bette. I have not read the daughter's book, but it obviously shook up Bette Davis and ruined a mother/daughter relationship. For me, this made the book end in a sad fashion. It also leaves the reader hanging, wondering if this mother and daughter ever worked out their differences. I can't really recommend this book unless you are just seeking more information on the life of one of Hollywood's biggest stars. One last positive thing I will say about the book is that Bette Davis does not get into a lot of the dirt she could have told about Hollywood stars. I do respect her for this.	2005-09-24

Some historic details were given, most of which can be found in his other books. The thing that was different about this one was the brief glimpse of Ambrose's personal life. We heard much of his relationships with other men. These are manly relationships, the kind we all need. It dealt with his two brothers and how they were close as well as some of his best friends through life. The most inspirational was the chapter that told of his relationship to his father. I wasn't deeply moved or anything, but I did appreciate the personal side of Ambrose. You will enjoy this written picture of proper male bonding. <br />	2005-09-22

He goes through his share of difficulties in order to find out who he really is. He was quite young when he sneaked away from home to follow his Uncle. The Uncle was wild and lived the life of a trapper. This is the life Jim learned until a tragic accident took place between him and a bear. His life was changed forever by this experience. He was nursed back to life by an old indian squaw and slowly became a part of the Crow tribe. He lived with them six years and began to feel more like and Indian than white. That was fine until he learned of the death of his mother. He also learned that he was needed by his two brothers and sister.

He certainly would not have been able to exhaust the subject in such a short history. Still, most of the world hasn't a clue as to the present day struggles of the Balkan region. Because of war in Bosnia and Kosovo as well as Milosevic and other war criminals in the news, the world's interest has been spiked. The problem is that nobody really seems to be able to get a grip on the problems facing Southeast Europe. For those with an interest but little understanding, this book will certainly help clarify many things. The strength of the book is that it takes the historical confusion of the Balkans and uses it to explain present day problems. We should all learn from the past. Hopefully, the people of the Balkans will learn from their past and lean toward a brighter future.	2005-09-08

Look at the amount of reviews for this book and that speaks for itself. Ambrose delivers again as he gives incredible detail of one of the greatest and hardest days of history. Great men fought and died for the cause of freedom! Mistakes were made, but the great plan of the allies on D-Day finally prevailed. All we can do is sit in awe at what took place that day. The details are given here very nicely, although all details could never be given. You can read eyewitness accounts. Some of them are gruesome but true experiences of war. War is not pretty or fun, yet even many of the lighter moments are given. It is great to read the actual words of the great men who fought and survived that day. I like the way Eisenhower puts it, \\"But it's a wonderful thing to remember what those fellows...were fighting for and sacrificing for, what they did to preserve our way of life. Not to conquer any territory, not for any ambitions of our own. But to make sure that Hitler could not destroy freedom in the world.\\" Read this book	2005-08-23

I truly did not expect to enjoy the book when I first picked it up. What I found was a rich treasure of Bosnian history. I understand that the work is fiction, but it seemed like such a true glimpse of history. Andric was a master of giving characters throughout the book that stoked the interest of the reader. The main character was the bridge itself. Everything and everyone else centered around this great old Turkish bridge. We see hundreds of years pass by over the reading of this book. Each of those new generations faces new challenges, from the days before a bridge existed, to the days of World War I. Everything in between gives detailed day to day experiences, intertwining generations and people. Andric really had a talent worthy of the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature, which he won for this book.

The first story, The Ranger, is fun to read. The actual story which shares the name of the book has almost nothing to do with anything western. I found it very boring and could not wait to finish it. The problem is that it takes up a good portion of the book. The last couple of stories are about whales and fishermen in Australia. One of them was written by Loren Grey, the daughter of Zane. These stories are actually the most interesting parts of the book and for me they made the book worth reading. I recommend you take a copy and read the first and last two stories. Unless you have nothing better to do, leave off the others in between.	2005-07-25

He is meticulous about the details and gives such a great glimpse of what was happening in the lives of George Armstrong Custer and Crazy Horse, from childhood to their deaths. Each man was very interesting, charismatic, and fearless. They came together, both believing they were invincible, at the Little Big Horn. They had been invincible before on numerous occasions, but this time, someone had to lose. I really appreciate Ambrose as he lets the reader know when he is giving facts that are backed up by historical evidence, and when he is simply speculating. The idea of Custer desiring a run at the presidency was very interesting to me. I recommend this book to any reader. Whether you are interested in History or not, you will find many things enjoyable about this book.	2005-07-09

I was somewhat disappointed by this book and I think it was because the title built it up too much for me. It was a good book and had good stories, but not the greatest ever told. As a matter of fact, most fishermen have told or at least heard better stories than these. Storytelling and fishing just sort of go together. You have to be able to stretch a pretty good fish tale if you're a fisherman. I think it's a requirement. All of that being stated, I did find some of the stories pretty interesting and do recommend it to those who enjoy both fishing and reading. There is a great story about Tarpon fishing and another by Zane Grey, when he caught a Marlin. Those are both worth reading. Another thing the book does is stress fly fishing. It almost seems to be saying that Fly fishing is the only real fishing. I am afraid I would have to disagree. I do have a new appreciation for this method, though, and feel a need to learn more about it. Maybe that was the author's intent.	2005-06-05

The difficulties she overcame in life were phenomenal. This book, however, was not interesting to me in the least. I am sad to hear about how she moved away from her traditional Christian background and followed the false teachings of Swedenborg. The book is more about Swedenborg than it is about Helen. It is a strong promotion of Swedenborg's New Church. She claims that he had a special ability from God to find the truth in scripture. The problem is, he like all other cult founders, only takes portions of scripture and uses them out of context. He claimed to have special revelations that no one else ever did. Beware of anyone who makes such claims. According to the book, Helen was pretty silent on her beliefs for the last thirty eight years of her life. I hope she was silent out of her realization that Swedenborg is not master of the truth, but Jesus is the truth instead. I do not recommend you use your time reading this book. It can be spent much more wisely.	2005-03-27

I was also a little disappointed that we did not really get to see more of the real Jordan. For a brief moment, we saw his humanity when he wrote about his father. Briefly, he mentioned his family. But mostly, he wrote about himself on the court. I guess I was hoping for more humility from this superstar. I believe he has it in him but the book doesn't show it.

I was amazed to read about things from the point of view of a little girl who was blind and deaf. She was so lost and alone until Anne Sullivan came into her life. But, even she knew when she was doing something wrong. She describes great details of her life I never heard before. She even gives an idea of what life was like before she discovered words. Helen wondered why her mother and others moved their mouth, but it was some time before she knew they were communicating with each other and then her long struggle to communicate began. I was surprised to read how she learned to read lips with her hands and even eventually learned to speak audibly. Not only did she gain that knowledge, but she became a brilliant young woman, writing the English language with great skill, as well as a few other languages. This book is brief, but well worth your time. You will gain a better understanding into the life of one with Helen's severe handicaps.	2005-03-04

I learned about towns, villages, and communities that I never knew existed. Some of them were very near my hometown. The book contained several types of dead town information. It told of former Indian villages, Spanish, French, British, and American settlements. The earliest date was an Indian village which began around 1200 and died about 1500. When the Spanish explorer and Conqueror, Desoto, came to Alabama, many of his findings were written down. Desoto found Alabama as it existed when the Indians were it's only residents. Harris gives many details of these early events. He also shares later stories of conflict between Indians and early settlers. When people think of Indian/American conflict, they usually think of the Wild West. There are great stories from Deep South too! He also shares stories and events from more modern towns that have failed to last. Some of them existed during the Civil War and some even existed into the twentieth century. Many of these are very interesting as well. If you do not live in Alabama, you might find the book boring. If you live here, you may find there is a Dead town very near you, waiting for you to explore.	2005-02-08

I found it to be a great glimpse into George Bush's life. It is good to hear about his prayer life as well. I think it is wonderful to see him as human and to watch him maturing in the faith as David Aikman describes. Some are skeptical because it seems that the timing is more politically motivated. Of course, only God can truly know because He is the one who saves and sanctifies. But, I have no doubt that He would choose to take this regular Texas boy and develop him and use him \\"for such a time as this.\\" I found it interesting to follow his spiritual journey. I guess my favorite part of the book was when Aikman took us through a brief spiritual glimpse of most of the presidents. That was great! He gave many wonderful quotes from past leaders of our great country! The book is worth reading just for that. Nevermind the negative reviews with political axes to grind.

Phil Waldrep is a wonderful speaker and conference organizer. He has worked many years with all ages. He especially knows and deals well with youth and senior adults. God has given him wisdom through years of service. He states that the idea for this book was born after years of hearing individuals plead with him to pray for their son or daughter who was away from God. He gained a passion to offer hope to the many adults who are concerned for their children who have swayed from the faith. In doing research for the book, Phil interviewed many adults who grew up in Christian homes, but turned their backs on their faith. Some of these returned to the faith they were taught while others, are still away from God. The stories are very interesting. Phil also offers hope by giving six principles for bringing your son or daughter back to God. The book is encouraging and does offer hope to the countless numbers of parents who are dealing with children who are away from God as adults. If you find yourself heartbroken over a child that has not gone in the right direction, pick up a copy of Phil's book and be encouraged. God can still bring them back.

To begin with, I need to say that this is no \\"Great Gatsby.\\" Having said that, I will give my opinion of F. Scott Fitzgerald's, \\"The Beautiful and the Damned.\\" It is a very good example of two lives lived without faith in God. Instead, Anthony Patch places his faith in millions he expects to inherit, while his wife has faith in the money and her beauty. It is clear that Fitzgerald writes from experience as he describes many of the struggles of becoming a writer as well as the struggle with alcoholism. Anthony Patch fully expected to inherit millions from his religiously devout uncle. His uncle disinherited him because of his immoral behavior and Anthony and Gloria end up in a desperate lawsuit throughout the book, hoping to change the courts initial decision. In that process, they are on a downward spiral in their relationship, relationships with friends, and their self esteem. I was reminded of the Biblical story of Job as I read the book. As Job had it all in the beginning, so did Anthony. As Job had it all taken away, so did Anthony. As Job's friends looked down upon him in his condition, so did Anthony's friends. Even Job's wife turned on him. Anthony's wife despised him as well. Then comes the difference. Job never lost faith in his God, but Anthony Patch never had faith. In the end, Job was rewarded with more blessings than he had ever had before. At the end of Anthony Patch's life, he got the blessing he had always longed for, but he was too far gone to enjoy it. I found it sad and depressing at times but it is worth the read. It's a look into the life of Fitzgerald and the age of World War I. It also reminds us that we can have all the world's goods and still have nothing, if we have ignored God in this life.	2005-01-22

His wife, Marie Brady Roloff, wrote the book. It is interesting reading. It follows along with the story of God leading this man to found homes for children who were in trouble. The amazing thing is that God used those homes in a big way to change the lives of so many for Christ. Not only did they become good believers, but they also became good citizens of the United States. After many years of this work of God, the whole Roloff enterprise came under attack. Roloff found himself in a fight against the state. He believed that his homes should not be forced to come under the restrictions placed upon them by the government. His great argument was that God had founded the work and it was under His authority and should not be submitted to government license, which might endanger the way the homes operated and saw success. It is a good story of the struggle between church and state. Believers often face adversity in this life. Roloff gives a fine example of how to face adversity and remain obedient to the faith.	2005-01-19

It is a series of news articles written by Birmingham News sports writers at the death of Bear Bryant. Bear Bryant coached his teams from Maryland, Kentucky, Texas A&M, and Alabama to the greatest coaching record of all times. He overcame Amos Alonzo Stagg's record in 20 less years than Stagg had accomplished the goal. He only had one losing season in all 37 years he coached. His record is phenomenal and even though I have great respect for Joe Paterno and Bobby Bowden, even their records cannot compare when you check the stats. Today, more games are played every year. It allows these modern coaches to get more wins quicker. Both Paterno and Bowden are a good bit older than Bear ever lived to be. Bear is truly a legend. The best thing about the book is the photos. It is full of great pictures throughout his era of coaching. When Bear retired, he died less than a month later. What else could be expected from a man who lived, ate, and breathed football all his life. This book does help us remember a great man. Buy it today.	2004-12-24

I have noticed that Louis L'Amour books with certain characters often seem to stand out. It's as though he gave special attention to special characters. This book is no exception. One of the main characters is called Owen Chantry. He is somewhat mysterious, but the Chantry name is quite popular in L'Amour novels. This book was also unique as L'Amour gave us another character, Doby, a sixteen year old boy. Doby speaks in first person. We read his every thought and plan. We see how lonely he is living far from civilization. He dreamed about about a \\"golden haired girl.\\" We even hear his poor english skills throughout the book. L'Amour is a master at capturing \\"country talk.\\" Of course the book has the regular bad guys, killing and even treasure. But, this time it is quite different. Get this book and read it.

I certainly did not agree with everything he had to say, but gained insight into his life and saw that some of his opinions were filled with good insight. I found it interesting to see how he and other NBA stars interacted according to him. I'd love to hear their opinions as well. I enjoyed hearing about some of the stars from the old days. Wilt stood up for them and how they should be better recognized today. I'd love to see DVD's available with clips from all of the old stars. Wilt thought highly of himself and that is obvious.

This is a major hangup to the Muslim, but it is a must to the Christian. For all Muslims who use this as a reason to ignore the claims of Christianity, you should read George's answer. Christians do not believe in three Gods! They believe in One God. For all Christians, beware of the temptation to compromise on this issue and lessen the importance of the Trinity. There is no true Christian faith without all parts of the Godhead.  <br /> <br />I guess you could say I liked this book and encourage you to read it as well. It will help your understanding on some vitally important issues between Christianity and Islam.	2004-12-11

Kitty Kelley does a great job of telling all the dirt she can dig up on Nancy Reagan and our former president, Ronald. Now, how much can you take to heart and accept as truth? That would be difficult to tell. Kelley gives great references, but the problem is that she has found people who have an axe to grind and she lets them grind away! I am certain that the former first family were not perfect. Some of the things we read about are likely true, but overall, they did a fantastic job. We really don't need to know all of their dirty laundry. When I read about the family struggles that were experienced between the Reagan's and their kids, I was disappointed. But, I never expected them to be perfect parents. I was very disappointed in the actions of the children as well. I read about Nancy's great desire for wealth, expensive clothes, etc. She and Ronald Reagan were criticized for gaining much wealth after the presidency by \\"using\\" their position. I could not help but laugh and think about how Kitty Kelley makes her wealth. Writing Gossip is real honorable. She certainly cashed in on Reagan's presidency, but she criticises Ronnie and Nancy for accepting speaking engagements, book offers, gifts, etc. Kelley was totally negative, taking most of her quotes from people who were angry with the Reagans. Why did she not spend more time interviewing the people who were close to the Reagans. She talked about, \\"the Girls,\\" but failed to include what they thought of Nancy. Instead of digging up the gossip, she should try giving a balanced report of things in the future. There are many who loved this first family greatly and many of them were very close to the true situation. I guess Kitty is afraid that the truth would not sell. If all of this is really true about Nancy, I deeply piti her. Kitty has certainly only given us one side of the story.	2004-11-24

It was written about a family and how they interacted throughout many years during the settling of the west. I found it hard to follow the storyline because there were too many names to try to keep up with. I know the title is very well known and popular, but I thought it could have been written better. Parts of the book were interesting despite the fact that some of the book was hard to follow. So, I'd recommend you read the book, but take your time and be sure you keep up with everything that's going on.	2004-11-24

There was no intention to stay out west long, but he found himself wrapped up in a mysterious situation. He was a man on the edge of being a criminal. Then he became the marshall that a town loved, then hated, then loved again. He still never intended to stay, but he had to stop a theft that would destroy the town. One more thing tempted him to stay long term... the girl. This one was well written and worth your time. It is a little far fetched, but what else do you expect? You'll enjoy it.	2004-11-02

He inherited this belief because his own father had been gunned down when he was a boy. After his father's death, he moved to the east and that is where he grew up. As a young man, he came west to buy, drive, and ship cattle back east. He thought he would have no need for a gun, but soon became known as a coward because of his beliefs. Over time, and with much trouble, he finally realized that he needed his guns to survive in this wild country. In the end, he defeats all his enemies and gets his cattle to the railroad head.

I found it interesting, and it would be especially good for younger readers who are interested in learning more about the Civil War. One of the strengths of the book was the photos as well as many paintings and drawings that came from the period of the Civil War. These give the reader a picture of the scenes of war. Other helpful things found in the book are maps of battlefields with explanations of what took place and in what areas. The book might be a little old and outdated, but it is still very helpful in explaining more of that awful period of American history.	2004-09-21

The Ferguson Rifle is about a young man who found himself in the wild west with nothing else to depend on but his gun. He had been given the rifle by it's maker and the interesting thing is that the rifle was ahead of it's time. Because of this, it got him out of many close calls. Since the main character was called \\"scholar\\" by his friends, it is easy to see that he was out of place in the wild west. But, with the help of his weapon, he managed to survive the onslaught of many outlaws, save the girl, and find the gold. The gold was not his, but he ended the story happy because of chivalry.	2004-09-18

It gave great detail to the 1984-6 expeditions headed by Owen Beattie that searched into the fatal artic expedition of 1845. In 1845, Sir John Franklin, known for his previous polar exploration, took two ships and 128 crew members into the icy north. Their goal was to find a northwest passage above Canada, but nobody ever heard from them again. Many have tried to solve the mystery, and much information has been handed down through time, but Beattie's group was the first which found traces of lead poisoning, which led them to believe that faulty food containers may have added to the loss of the men from these expedition. The most interesting thing about the book is the detailed explanations of exhuming the graves of three sailors from Sir Franklin's failed attempt. Pictures add to the excitement and looking into the frozen faces of men who died 150 years ago, excite the imagination. You will also be left with a feeling of sadness at the terrible fate of those men and all who perished with them in the arctic wilderness. May they rest in peace.	2004-08-19

I like the Sherlock Holmes mysteries as well, but felt Doyle did something very different here and it was refreshingly interesting to read. I realize there have been many modern day copycat type stories, with Jurassic Park being one of these, but I felt Doyle's version just had something extra. I guess we all dream of the day when someone finds a \\"Lost World\\" where prehistoric animals still reign, despite the fact that we know it is impossible. As I read it, I tried to put myself back in time and think as his original audience must have thought. At that time, with the lack of technology, they could certainly have imagined a place out there, yet to be discovered. The story also has an evil side. The frightening part of the story was not the great beasts, as people often think of dinosaurs and their counterparts. The scary characters were the ape-men, who cruelly and viciously attacked our heros. These fictitous characters gave the story that something extra. Killing them was not politically correct, but it was necessary. Hey Disney, pick this one up and run with it on the big screen. It will be a hit if you keep to the original story.	2004-08-13

I am sorry but I cannot give this book a good rating. It claims to have life lessons on raising a girl and all I found was a collection of sayings. Some of them were good suggestions, but most were just sentimental \\"warm fuzzies.\\" Maybe this is all that some guys need to help them raise their daughter, but I have four and I need much more help than this book was able to deliver. Also, before you buy check the dimensions of the book. It is really small and each page contains about a sentence. It is really not worth the money you will spend on it.

I especially enjoyed the beginning sections which gave a brief overview of the history and politics of Iran. Most Americans truly have no idea what is happening in that part of the world. We tend to want to ignore the troubles there when we really should be more interested in finding ways that we can help. By reading this book, anyone will gain a better understanding of the worldview of a person from Iran. This book brings home the point that we can help by befriending and sharing with those who live among us in our own country. Many Iranians have fled their country for different reasons. They may be your neighbor. This book can help you be a better neighbor to them. I have not worked much personally with Iranians, but having spent much time with other people groups of Muslim origin, I can testify that this book would be beneficial to anyone who wants to share their Christian faith with a Muslim friend. The book was written in 1982 and I would love to see an updated version. It would be interesting to know how far the case study has advanced, and understand the present political climate a little better. I hope many will get this book and put it to good use, practicing what it teaches on a daily basis.	2004-05-24

It is also good if you are a beginning reader. It is easy to finish a story quickly and therefore not lose the plot. Each story has a totally different plot and characters and it is easy to put it down a few days and then pick it up again and read. In this book, there are eleven different stories. Louis L'Amour tells how he often finds a character when writing short stories that he later will use again for an entire novel. There are a few of those in this book. Killkenny becomes a character in several L'Amour novels. As usual, when reading short stories, some will be really interesting and others might be quite boring. Both of these can be found in this book. It is worth your time to pick up a copy and read Dutchman's Flat.	2004-05-23

It never ceases to amaze me how awesome God is and how mysteriously He works in the lives of people throughout the world. A woman like Bilquis Sheikh coming to Christ shows His absolute power in working in the lives of those who genuinely seek Him. I was given this book by a lady who was born a Muslim and lives in a Muslim land. It highly impacted her life for the good. Also, having known a number of Muslims who have converted to Christianity, I have seen the sad reality of how a Muslim family can totally reject and mistreat one of their own who converts. For a Muslim to follow Christ, much sacrifice takes place. The account of Bilquis Sheikh proves that this sacrifice is worth making. As you read this account of what happened in the life of one lady who &quot;dared to call God Father,&quot; you will be swept up in the excitement and emotions of God's wonderful work. It is a book that Muslims and Christians alike should read and enjoy.	2004-05-10

She gave up all of the normal comforts of western life and totally followed God's will. She even sacrificed the hope of a husband and family, but God gave her a bigger family than she could have ever imagined! She dared to head off into the unknown with nothing but her faith in God. It proved to be more than enough and God blessed her with spiritual fruit beyond our understanding. You must read this book! It is so well done and inspiring! It would be great for the whole family.

It might help you better understand where they are coming from. My wife always has a fit when she sees boys hitting each other. I think Eldredge gives great insight into this interesting phenomenon. All fathers should read the book to help themselves avoid wounding their own sons through words or deeds. They may also find themselves dealing with wounds that have been given to them in the past. Much more could be said about the book but other reveiwers have touched on the ways that this book speaks directly to the heart of the man who is reading it.

Perhaps that is the reason I found this book to be one of his weaker efforts. Many times when I read a book by this author, I have trouble putting it down because it is enjoyable. This time I found myself in a hurry to get finished. I thought the plot really struggled. He failed to give enough details of that time period. The crossing of Russia in order to deliver Helena to the Tsar needed more effort. Of course he was writing about a time and a place which would be difficult to give accurate details. If you are a big fan of L'Amour, you will naturally want to read it, but if this is your first effort at reading one of his books, start with something different.	2004-04-20

It was one of his poorer works. L'Amour writes about a man named Barney Kilrone. He was an ex-soldier who had been given a raw deal and blamed for something he had never done. He finds himself in the middle of a bad situation that entangles him in a mess of renegade indians, massacres, and jealousy, and a drunken commander who seeks notoriety. In the end he saves the day and gets the girl, but not the girl some might have expected.

The real character is a young boy who was born into a terrible situation. Things looked hopeless for him when he was abandoned by his cold and heartless mother. Good fortune smiled upon him when he found his new care taker to be a gambling man with savvy and character. Will Reilly raised him right and taught him the secrets he would need to be a successful man. After a terrible killing, Val finds himself wanting revenge.
