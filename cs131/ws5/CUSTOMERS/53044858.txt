One of the most vivid scenes in the book is when the main character, John Dupre, and his friend Lyle go searching for a Kerouac-style \\"on the road\\" adventure, and end up merely hitchhiking to a town in Ohio whose main street can be walked in 5 minutes. <br /> <br />It may be a bit early to evaluate this work, because three more volumes are planned.  At this point, for me John Dupre is not as interesting a character as Gloria, the title character from one of Maillard's other novels.  That novel also meandered pleasantly.  \\"Running\\" instead lives up to its title in that it is fast paced.  It also is written strictly from the point of view of the main character, so that other characters are not drawn as vividly. <br /> <br />I look forward to future volumes.	2005-09-27

Perhaps because it has at least two layers. <br /> <br />One layer is a story about boarding school, and one girl's struggles with it.  If that were the only layer, or if it's the only layer you focus on, then there would not be much more to \\"Prep\\" than a screenplay for a mediocre teen flick. <br /> <br />The other layer is a story of an adult looking back at her teen years.  This is the layer that made the book gripping for me.  I think most adults feel some degree of pull from their high school  or college days.  A mixture of nostalgia, embarrassment, regret, etc.  Sittenfeld captures those emotions, along with the actual teenage emotions. <br /> <br />I also think that the final scenes in the book are beautifully written.  You really feel the process of Lee's separation from the school. <br /> <br />Finally, the scenes, relationships, and emotions in \\"Prep\\" seem authentic.  Precisely because there is no tight plot, because characters appear and disappear, because vignettes (such as a period during which Lee cuts other students' hair) lead nowhere, \\"Prep\\" resembles life.  Which is not a screenplay.	2005-03-03

This book offers examples of quantitative reasoning, including the topics of compound growth and statistics.  Their perspective is that without the ability to work with numbers, people can easily be misled.  One of the examples is a statistic used by defense attorney Alan Dershowitz to mislead the jurors in the infamous Simpson trial.<br />As I was reading the book, I wondered who the audience ought to be.  Although the tone is breezy and the examples are presented without the use of algebra or higher mathematics, I am not sure how a math-phobic person would react.  My experience with math phobes is that they would feel threatened by the book and be resistant to picking it up.<br />A better audience for the book might be math educators.  As a teacher, I found numerous examples in the book that will be helpful.  Moreover, the last chapter, in which they discuss ways to reform math education, is a gem.<br />What the authors are saying is that people need good basic intuition about numbers in order to understand a world that is increasingly dominated by numerical data.  The traditional math curriculum tries to prepare a student to study Newtonian physics.  Instead, I think that the authors would argue that the curriculum ought to be aimed at enabling a student to understand stock market ratios and statistical research.<br />One random note is that the authors attribute the phrase \\"independence from irrelevant alternatives\\" to John Nash.  I may be wrong, but I believe that it was Kenneth Arrow who brought that concept to the fore.<br />By filling the book with interesting examples that illustrate the type of quantitative reasoning that they consider important, the authors make a compelling case for the math education reform that they advocate.  However, if their primary audience is math educators, that fact is obscured on the book jacket, which makes the intended audience unclear.	2003-06-08

It appeals of to those of us who are nostalgic for those comedians and that time period. <br />Author Gerald Nachman has authoritative knowledge backed by extensive research.  Most of the comedians covered by his book are in their 70's and 80's, and he has interviewed many of them.  For the most part, he avoids over-analyzing comedy or lapsing into pompous amateur sociology.<br />Overall, however, I find the book to be a mile wide and an inch deep.  It's very time-consuming to plow through the whole thing.  In the end, I did not come away feeling that I knew much more about Mort Sahl or Jean Shepherd than I did from reading the record jacket of &quot;The Future Lies Ahead&quot; or the book flap of &quot;In God we Trust, All others Pay Cash.&quot;<br />I wish that Nachman had a better editor. At a detail level, the inconsistency of dates is a constant source of annoyance.  I felt like someone could be 40 years old one year, and 47 years old ten years later.<br />On a larger level, I would have shortened the book by trimming some of the name-linking and uninformative quotations.  Instead, I would have appreciated some bullet-point style presentations that encapsulated timelines, career highlights, and best available recordings. <br />This could have been a better book.	2003-04-20

This is a book that a lot of people will buy in order to put on their bookshelves to show off.  It's a challenging book to read, but it rewards the effort.<br />The book starts out with an argument against what to a non-academic would appear to be a straw man:  the  dogmatic, anti-scientific ideology that is peculiar to college professors, particularly in the humanities.  If you have a child in high school, do not let him or her go off to college without first reading Pinker.  But if you do not worry about encountering the academic dogma, then you may find the first third of the book somewhat tedious.<br />Pinker is mainly concerned with describing the way evolution has shaped the innate propensities and limitations of human thinking.  My favorite chapter happens to be the one called &quot;Out of Our Depths,&quot; which describes the way our brains are not wired to readily grasp some of the knowledge and ideas that we have developed in the past few hundred years.  This includes not only modern physics but much of economics.<br />It is not possible in a short review to do justice to the breadth and insights of this book.  Suffice to say that I give it my highest recommendation.	2003-01-24

It's just not widely distributed yet.\\"<br />Rheingold sees elements that will be important in the future, and he tries to forecast what will happen when they become widely distributed. The result is an important book.<br />Probably the central part of the future will be an explosion in wireless communication. This will lower the cost of Internet access in countries that never developed a solid wired infrastructure. It will enable people to remain constantly aware of one another's presence and location, using instant-messaging-type services. It will make possible what Rheingold calls \\"sentient things,\\" which are physical objects that sense and response to people, because both the objects and the people are on the universal wireless network.<br />Rheingold looks past the technology to the social implications of the wireless age. For example, in a world where we have the potential to be bombarded with messages, he believes that the only way to achieve order rather than chaos is through reputation systems. Something like my Amazon reviewer's rating will matter more and more in the smartmobs world.<br />There is much here to chew on. Rheingold deserves praise for helping to distribute the future.	2002-12-14

This book is a useful summary of his views.<br />One point of emphasis is \\"open source\\" intelligence--the information that is available from sources outside of the secret intelligence community.  Steele argues that the institutional secretiveness of the FBI and CIA is a hindrance rather than a help.<br />Another point of emphasis is language translation.  A further point of emphasis is the fact that threats no longer exclusively take the form of powerful nation-states.  I wish that the book focused more specifically on Islamic terrorism, since the other potential threats seem more remote at the moment.<br />Yet another point of emphasis is database integration.  Writing this review in the aftermath of the DC sniper investigation, this seems to be an important point.  Before the suspects drove to Maryland, they were involved in a murder in Alabama at which one of them left a fingerprint.  Had the Alabama police been able to access a national database, they would have been able to identify the murderer and perhaps apprehend him.  Instead, the fingerprint was matched only after a dozen more murders and after the suspects themselves told police to connect the dots to Alabama.<br />Lack of database integration kills.	2002-11-09

It is not just that these countries, such as Syria and Turkmenistan, are rarely visited.  Kaplan goes to places within these countries where there are no 4-star hotels--indeed nothing that would earn so much as one star in an American guidebook.  He describes the poverty, the military checkpoints, the mafia-like behavior of governments, etc.  He shows how the vast oil reserves near the Caspian Sea are making the region important, even as the rule of law remains elusive.<br />As an economist, I consider this a must-read book, if for no other reason than to see the devastation that was wrought by the breakup of the Soviet Union.  Having read hundreds of pages written by Ph.D's on privatization and \\"transition economics,\\" all from an Ivory Tower perspective, I find that Kaplan's on-the-ground reporting provides a much-needed reality check.<br />Anyone who tries to offer advice on \\"peace processes\\" or \\"economic development\\" needs to factor in the way things really work on the ground.  By visiting the countries themselves, dealing directly with thuggish police and border patrols, and seeing how everyday people really function in these countries, Kaplan provides valuable data.  <br />In addition to the valuable substance, the quality of writing is very high.  Kaplan's descriptions are vivid, and his observations are often under-stated and even humorous.<br />If you have not read this book, then you should.	2002-10-04

How would you reconstitute our security structure?  He gets down to specifics in chapter 15, where he gives 26 rules for \\"the new craft of intelligence.\\"  These include an emphasis on translation of foreign sources, an emphasis on cultural intelligence (knowing your enemy), and gearing intelligence toward needs and customers vs. just following old habits and using the most ready capabilities.<br />This book rewards the reader with many interesting ideas to consider.  But Steele badly needs a filter--I feel that there are way too many bad ideas in this book relative to the few nuggets.  For example, his view of the causes of terrorism owes much to Noam Chomsky--a poor source for cultural intelligence.  Furthermore, some (most?) of his proposals, such as instituting a draconian military draft, are not well thought out.  <br />I think that there is reason to be concerned that we have not adjusted out thinking on military and intelligence matters to line up with current threats.  But if this book is the best alternative, then we should be even more concerned.	2002-09-25

The essays deal with the mindset and military tactics of Muslim Arabs and of our own leaders.<br />Peters shows true sensitivity and understanding of the Muslim Arab mentality.  His is not the politically correct approach to sensitivity, which requires denial of the backwardness and adolescent nature of Arab Muslim thinking.  Instead, Peters is honest and accurate.  Like much else about 9-11, the confused and contradictory response of Muslims, in which they simultaneously celebrated a Muslim triumph and denied Muslim culpability, would have been predictable to someone who had absorbed Peters' lessons.<br />In this book, Peters demonstrates a brilliant, intuitive mind that is able to synthesize complex strands of history, psychology, economics, and military analysis to arrive at powerful generalizations.  Its insights are as dazzling as the treasure of Monte Cristo.	2002-09-02

The view that such a dichotomy is possible and desirable is what Cohen calls the &quot;normal theory.&quot;<br />According the &quot;normal theory,&quot; wars are conducted best when civilians set broad objectives and leave it to the military to achieve those objectives, free from meddling.  Cohen instead argues that the greatest civilian war leaders are &quot;meddlers,&quot; not in the sense that they interfere with military decisions, but in the sense that they avidly study and question the thought process of the generals and admirals.<br />A business analogy would be with information technology.  A &quot;normal theory&quot; would be that CEOs should set business strategy, and leave IT strategy to specialists.  However, this dichotomy in fact is unworkable, because a CEO who does not understand how technology affects the business will be ineffective.<br />I came away from the book persuaded of Cohen's main thesis.  That is, I can see that the line between political and military strategy is necessarily blurred, and that military commanders should not be above challenge and questioning.  Above all, I see the need for civilian war leaders to immerse themselves in the problems of war, so that they can communicate effectively with generals and make decisions that are realistic.<br />I think that if all I had to go on were Cohen's profiles of Lincoln, Clemenceau, Churchill, and Ben-Gurion, I would not have been so persuaded.  I found those chapters to be sketchy, with too many digressions for my taste.<br />On the other hand, the discussion of the Viet Nam war and its aftermath was very thought-provoking.  I think that a lot of people would like to comfort themselves with a simplistic view that &quot;we could have won if we'd let the military do it's job.&quot;  Cohen argues otherwise, and I think that he is right, but I am sure that this one chapterwill not be enough to end the debate.<br />There are those who say that this is the book that President Bush should be reading in the aftermath of 9-11.  Actually, I would want him to read David Brin's &quot;The Transparent Society&quot; and also Churchill's World War II memoirs.  As Cohen points out, Churchill's ability to identify key theaters, such as the Battle of the Atlantic, was very powerful.	2002-08-26

The setting is Laramie, Wyoming, during the crowded, raucous Jubilee Days.<br />Compared with her first novel, \\"Brown-eyed Girl,\\" the writing here is more compact.  Where \\"Brown-eyed Girl\\" was replete with two-page digressions, in \\"Bad Company\\" Swift is more apt to toss of a one-liner.<br />Still, I would recommend reading \\"Brown-eyed Girl\\" before \\"Bad Company.\\"  You get a fuller background of the characters, particularly Hawk, who was more richly drawn in the first book.  He's rather uninteresting here.    In fact, there are points in \\"Bad Company\\" where Alder seems to be more intrigued by Scotty Atkins, a detective who is assigned to the murder. <br />The New York Times accurately describes Swift's writing as a comedy of manners.  The plot is merely a scaffolding on which to hang Swift's many observations about the variety of the human species.  To enjoy the novel, you have to be amused by incidents such as a nerdy academic slinging post-modernism in a Western saloon.	2002-07-12

But it also contains material that struck me as filler.<br />I think that Fukuyama's most valuable contribution is to highlight the effects of neuropharmacology.  Most people would be instinctively repelled by the notion of using genetic engineering to alter personality.  But Fukuyama reminds us that personality-altering medication is commonplace.  He forces us to think about trying to make our views more consistent.<br />But Fukuyama also takes this as an opportunity to give a short course on philosophy.  I don't know why he thinks that this is his job.  His discussion of Plato, Kant, and others did not add anything to what I learned in college.  And even if you have never taken a course in the history of philosophy, you probably were not looking for this book to provide it.	2002-06-18

The book takes a generally positive view of genetic engineering, although the arguments tend to boil down to:<br />1.  We can't stop it.<BR>2.  We already do it to some extent.<BR>3.  If you try to stop it, what are you going to tell the parents of children with horrible diseases?<BR>4.  We can mostly rely on individual choice to sort out the moral issues.<br />On most issues, that's about as deep as the analysis gets in this book.<br />Here is an example of an issue where Stock's level of analysis is not satisfying.  Suppose that it becomes possible to replace a child who dies in an auto accident by using cloning.  In thinking about this, I believe we have to do more than look at the first-order impact it has on the parents of a dead child.  <br />We need to look at second-order and third-order effects.<BR>Teenagers are pretty reckless as it is.  Imagine that a teenager says, \\"what the heck.  If this gets me killed, my parents can always just clone me.\\"  What is the end result?<br />Stock is most valuable in describing the ways in which it might be possible to design people with chromosomes today that might be programmed or re-programmed in later years, depending on how research turns out.  That is an interesting concept, and one that I certainly had not thought of before.<br />He also is well considered to have a chapter on \\"the enhanced and the unenhanced.\\"  I came away from that chapter thinking that trying to regulate these technologies is going to be like trying to regulate athletes at the Olympics.  The lines are going to be hard to draw and harder to enforce.<br />On the whole, this is a worthwhile book for those interested in the topic.  But in my opinion it falls a bit short of being a definitive work.	2002-05-21

Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find a balanced, careful analysis.  <br />Lomborg makes a very complete survey of all of the potential environmental problems associated with population growth and economic development.  He then evaluates statistical indicators of the magnitude and direction of the problems.  What he finds tends to be comforting.<br />In some cases, indicators actually are improving.  Food production is improving, and starvation is declining (albeit slowly, because of political problems).  I was surprised to read that the supply of fish actually is increasing, once fish farming is included.<br />Another environmental issue is water.  Here, Lomborg shows that the rate of replenishment is adequate.  The challenge is to improve access of the world's poor to potable water.<br />I wish that more young people and policmakers would read this book.  It makes an excellent textbook.  It provides a useful starting point for thinking about environmental and economic policy going forward.

If my randomly-chosen essay were chapter 9, \\"The World of Achilles,\\" my expectations would have been very high.  <br />Chapter 9 is terrific because it is insightful and specific.  Kaplan makes predictions about how society will evolve to fight asymmetric warfare:<br />--The line between military and civilian will blur. <BR>--It may be more important to assassinate an individual than to attack an infrastructure.  Kaplan describes terrorist infrastructure as \\"immediately replaceable,\\" a comment which might give pause to those who would be complacent after what we have accomplished in Afghanistan.<BR>--the media will create a foreign policy agenda based on visible pain, which does not necessarily coincide with sober national interest<BR>--asymmetric war is chronic and clandestine, as opposed to finite and open.  This means that the agencies prosecuting the war may become removed from democratic control.<br />This chapter is filled with these sorts of insights.  However, to me, many of the other chapters seemed too vague--sort of like Nostradamus predictions.  <br />There are enough insights in chapter 9 to warrant writing an entire book.  Unfortunately, this is not quite that book.	2002-02-15

He makes the case that companies need to evolve more quickly in the current environment, and he identifies policies and attitudes that are conducive to more rapid evolution.<br />For example, he argues that most companies:<br />--are too careless when they fill positions; <BR>--are too lazy about firing managers who reduce employee effectiveness;<BR>--often fail to take advantage of the talent in companies that they acquire. <br />To make these points sound less dry, he compares hiring and firing to mating strategy.  Mating strategies matter a lot in evolution, and Godin reasons by analogy that hiring and firing strategies matter a lot in corporate evolution.  <br />Throughout the book, the metaphor of evolution is used in this way to enliven the discussion.  However, I don't think that Godin's ideas stand or fall on the metaphor. <br />On p. 230, Seth Godin proposes a procedural rule that would make it difficult to turn down innovative suggestions.<br />\\"appoint a CNO--a chief NO officer.  No longer can someone say no to an idea and leave it at that.  If you want to turn something down, you've got to pass it on to our boss.  Then either he says yes or gives it to his boss.  For a no to be official, it's got to be approved by the chief NO officer and countersigned by every manager along the way.\\"<br />It is Godin's misfortune to have this book released during the era of the Enron scandal.  Enron sounds like a company where in order to stop something you needed to get the approval of a chief NO officer.  In fact, on p.55 of this book, Godin cites Enron as a positive role model.<br />To steal Godin's metaphor, I suspect that corporate bureaucracy is positively adapted to an environment in which managers are making bets using company dollars.  Without the veto-wielding committees that Godin detests, there would be more Enrons.<br />All that said, this is a valuable book that deserves to be read by business executives.  In the post-Enron era, the challenge is to apply Godin's insights but with some appropriate checks and balances.	2002-02-11

Stoll makes the case that computers are more likely part of the problem.  <br />My favorite line is from p. 99: <br />&quot;No pilot project in educational technology has ever been declared a failure.&quot;<br />This aptly characterizes the process of evaluating technology in education as utterly lacking in rigor.<br />Unfortunately, this book also is lacking in rigor. On that score, I cannot disagree with Stoll's critics.  There is a lot more strong rhetoric than strong proof here. <br />But the bottom line remains:  Stoll is probably right.  The conventional wisdom vastly overstates the benefits and understates the costs of computers in education.  If this book does nothing more than encourage people to ask questions about costs and benefits, it will have done a heroic service.	2001-11-24

In fact, they never mention the abortion issue again.  Instead, they offer some additional proposals for a centrist candidate, many of which make sense.   <br />For example, they suggest raising the retirement age for social security.  As I have argued elsewhere, raising the retirement age is in fact the only meaningful policy option available to deal with the demographic realities--the &quot;plans&quot; put forward by the two major parties are both bogus.<br />I also like the authors' proposal to abolish racial classifications. I call this the &quot;one-race&quot; doctrine:  declare that we all belong to one race, the human race.<br />Overall, the book reads like a quixotic attempt to convince Democrats to adopt an agenda on Social Security, education, taxes, and race that is somewhat to the right of the platform that George Bush ran on in the year 2000.  There is no &quot;radical center&quot; position on abortion, so I can only infer that the authors are pro-choice (otherwise, they would be Republicans).<br />But the authors never provide a solution to the problem that they pose in the quotation above.  How can those of us who are pro-choice on abortion but tired of the industrial-era Democratic policies on other issues find candidates that we can support?	2001-11-19

What are our options?<br />(a) try to ban certain types of surveillance technologies altogether<br />(b) try to restrict surveillance technologies so that &quot;we&quot; have it but &quot;they&quot; don't<br />(c) try to escape surveillance technology by using encryption<br />(d) try to encourage broad access to surveillance technology<br />David Brin argues persuasively that (d) is the least problematic solution.  The other strategies are both more difficult to execute and less likely to produce a desirable outcome.  For example, with (c) you have the problem that encryption may not be perfectly reliable.  Moreover, even if you can encrypt your bits, you cannot encrypt your atoms.  So you still may be subject to surveillance by a network of cameras, by centralized databases, etc.<br />The greatest strength of the book is the way that Brin analyzes the situation from the perspective of different opponents to his position.  The greatest weakness is that he rarely delves into details about how to implement his overall recommendation.  What incentives need to be created?  How do laws need to be changed, etc.? He offers hints, and occasional examples, but leaves a lot out.<br />The relevance of this book has increased dramatically as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11.  For example, on p. 320 there is this passage:<br />&quot;Terrorists operate under cloaks of anonymity and secrecy...This is especially true of their concealed finances...the real impulse to force them open may only come after some band of terrorists manages to kill thousands...&quot;<br />What Brin advocates is not a stronger police state but a more open system that allows any citizen to trace how money flows.  Thus, although he would agree with the national security establishment that secret bank accounts are a problem, he would part ways with the establishment in that he would not give the police special privileges to examine bank transactions.  Instead, he would expose such transactions to anyone.<br />This is just one of many interesting ideas in this provocative book.	2001-11-12

The course will cover HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web graphics. The ideal book on Photoshop for this class would: 1. be focused on Web graphics (Photoshop is not just a web tool, and other books spend a lot of time on other aspects). 2. be clear, with bite-sized examples and step by step instructions 3. include as topics creating background graphics, animation, and image map rollovers 4. be inexpensive Well, three out of four is not bad. Photoshop 6 Web Magic is too expensive to require students to buy it. Otherwise, it is what I was looking for. The price of the book probably is due to the high cost of color reproduction. If your idea of a book is large quantities of verbiage, then you will feel very cheated here. But for my needs, less is more. I can use the examples in this book to give students a sense of accomplishment. This should be better for them than a comprehensive treatise that is less accessible. Should you buy this book? My guess is that you will like it more to the extent that: --you prefer learning from examples to learning from theory --you prefer a book that is organized around particular problems or projects to one that is organized around the features of the software --you really want to focus on the Web aspects of Photoshop 6.0 I fit that profile, and I am pleased with the book.	2001-08-28

I think it would enable a relative novice to get started.<br />Sometimes, as when she introduces XHTML early in chapter 2, Willard gets into theory that I imagine would go over the head of a beginner.  But her examples are clear enough so that I think most people should be able to plow ahead anyway.<br />Here is where I am coming from.  I am an experienced Web programmer who will be teaching a high school course in Web design.  In general, I am finding that I want to write my own lectures--and put them on line--rather than use a book.<br />I'm thinking that this is 2001.  But most introductory Web authoring books include a mishmash of material, some of which is state of the art in 1996, and some of which is more current. <br />Compared to what is out there in general, Willard's book is incrementally better.  She talks about the .png format for graphics.  Her chapter on cascading style sheets is longer than that in competing books, but not nearly long enough.<br />What I am asking for is a book that throws out or downplays all the hacks we learned four years ago (font tags, table-driven layouts, frames) and instead takes style sheets as the core design tool.  In 2001, you'd think that there would be a beginner's book that takes such an approach.  Maybe Willard will take that on as her next project.	2001-08-09

He points out that if you ban the use of ivory, you reduce the incentive for people to raise elephants, and you could end up reducing the supply of elephants.<br />I xeroxed those pages and gave them to my 5th-grader to give to her teacher.  That teacher was happily indoctrinating her students into the politically correct view that banning the use of ivory is good policy.<br />This is economics at its best--showing the fallacy of a common viewpoint with simple logic.  There is much of that in this book.<br />This book is &quot;Chicago economics&quot; through and through.  You get the pragmatic justification for the assumption that people maximize their well being.  You get the invasions of other territory, such as politics and marriage.  And you get everything presented on diagrams with lines and curves.<br />It's the diagrams that make me hesitant to recommend this book to a casual reader.  I can see their usefulness in a classroom, where you draw them in front of a captive audience.  But I think that Friedman should try a different approach if he wants to make the book accessible to someone who is not in an economics class.	2001-08-09

However, I would think that over 90 percent of the people who might consider buying this book should instead buy another edition.  The problem with this one is that the JavaScript tutorial, which provides the most accessible introduction to JavaScript, is NOT included in book form.  It is only on the CD-ROM.  Therefore, for beginning and even intermediate JavaScripters, this book is more difficult to use than the other editions.<br />I have the original &quot;JavaScript Handbook,&quot; which was the forerunner of this book.  The Gold edition naturally is much more up to date and complete.  However, unless you already own one of the earlier editions, I would stay away from this one and get an earlier edition of The JavaScript Bible instead.  Those I can recommend without qualification.	2001-08-03

What percent is accounted for by machines?  Most of us would say that machines account for a relatively small percent--I would say far less than one percent.<br />But as Satchel Paige famously warned, &quot;Don't look back.  It might be gaining on you.&quot;  Kurzweil looks at the rate at which computers are gaining on humans, and he projects that machine intelligence will increase in significance until it becomes the dominant form of intelligence by the end of the 21st century.<br />Kurzweil points out that Moore's law is a highly nonlinear process.  Exponential growth implies that the future can be radically different from the past.  He makes a convincing case that *if* Moore's Law continues to hold and *if* machine intelligence is correlated with Moore's Law, then some very dramatic things are going to happen to the human race, even within our lifetimes.  Although his description of this scenario may sound like science fiction, it is plausible in light of his assumptions.<br />I myself am not sold on Kurzweil's assumptions.  Maybe I spent too many years as a student of economics, but I still believe in diminishing returns.  In an essay on my site called &quot;Autoregressive Models,&quot; I explicitly question Kurzweil's forecasting method.<br />Nonetheless, Kurzweil has staked out an interesting position.  Just as Jared Diamond's &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; offers a more provocative view of economic history than anything economists have written, Kurzweil offers a more provocative view of the economic future than anything economists have written.	2001-08-03

The author succeeds in making this a compelling story by squeezing the maximum amount of melodrama out of it.<br />First, she does a nice job of describing the Depression-era setting.  She sets up a conflict between upstart California, where horse racing has just been re-legalized, and the older East Coast tracks.<br />Second, she brings out the temperamental idiosyncrasies of the proud horse, the flamboyant owner, the laconic trainer, and the gritty jockey.  They are as colorful as characters in a novel.<br />Third, she takes us inside the world of racing:  the dangers and athletic demands faced by jockeys; the fouls and subterfuge that were committed during this period; the power of the racing stewards.<br />The result is a very gripping story. The book is almost bound to exceed anyone's expectations for it.	2001-07-27

Thirty years ago, after all, Tom Wolfe gave us the marvelous essay and book, Radical Chic.<br />Brooks offers many keen observations about the Bobo outlook on work, consumption, politics, and so forth.  Bobos in Paradise is interesting, thought-provoking, and worth the time spent reading it.  I probably should give it five stars.<br />But. . .the tone of gentle irony was ultimately infuriating to me.  It's like he is almost apologizing to Bobos for hinting at some hypocrisies and moral inconsistencies in their behavior.  His final peroration reads, \\"They can be silly a lot of the time.  But if they raise their sights and ask the biggest questions, they have the ability to go down in history as the class that led America into another golden age.\\".....<br />Rather than send the Bobos off on some great redemptive public crusade, I would prefer to see them first try to recover their moral compass.   My views on the Bobo mentality are less sanguine than Brooks'.  My site will have an essay on \\"Troubles in Bobos' Paradise.\\"	2001-07-14

I picked up some CSS from web sites, but I wanted a reference.  <br />I looked through this book and Eric Meyer's in the bookstore, and surprisingly I chose this one.  It seemed to be more accessible, with a lot of examples that are very clearly displayed.  <br />I have been quite successful at adapting the examples.  The author has included some helpful little features, such as a list of font families and which operating systems/browsers support them.<br />So far, I've found one example that displays differently on my configuration than it does in the book.  My guess is that I may find other &quot;mistakes&quot; as I go along.<br />Frankly, I was not interested in DHTML when I bought this book, so I cannot review that aspect.<br />Overall, I think that this is the best introduction to CSS that is available right now.

The result is a book that you want to think about and discuss. <br />However, compared to other readers, I have a very different take on this book.  Maybe it's because I have been much luckier with my daughters, or because I'm a guy.  But whatever the reason, I wanted to shake the author and say, &quot;Wake up! You are in an abusive relationship.  Defend yourself!&quot;<br />One of the most poignant anecdotes is where she describes how she makes lunches for her daughter, but her daughter does not eat them.  And yet her daughter insists that &quot;you have to make my lunch.  You have to.&quot;  <br />I want the mother to say, &quot;No, I don't have to make your lunch if you're not going to eat it.  Lunch is food.  It is not something I make for you just because I crave your approval.&quot;<br />Instead, the mother goes on making lunches.  I am not suggesting that by changing her behavior the mother could have made one iota of difference in how her daughter turned out.  But I am disturbed that neither the author nor many of the other readers of this book recognize the distinction that I see between loving your daughter and giving her total power over you.<br />If we are going to celebrate this as an exemplary mother-daughter relationship, then we should celebrate women who tolerate and submit to abusive husbands as exemplary, also.  Instead, I would hope that we could encourage parents to be more assertive with their children.	2001-06-19

This is not just a drawn-out version of Pink's classic cover story in Fast Company.  It reflects extensive research and provides many surprising insights and interesting predictions.<br />This is not a book you can polish off in an hour or two.  It is difficult to convey in a brief review the depth and richness of Free Agent Nation.<br />Pink demonstrates that free agents are a large and growing share of the work force.  He describes some of the economic forces contributing to this phenomenon, but he finds that free agents themselves explain their reasons for leaving the corporate world in psychological terms:  a desire for freedom, authenticity, accountability, and flexible concepts of success.<br />Pink shows that free agents have their own unique perspectives and solutions to such challenges as security, workplace relationships, career advancement, and work-family balance. For example, he describes the way that peer networks are providing the type of career support that formerly came from within large corporations.  <br />Whether you like it or not, the gravitational forces between individuals and large corporations are weakening.  In the future, how will business be re-organized?  How will the economy function?  Daniel Pink asks the big questions, and he comes up with a lot of fascinating answers.  I expect Free Agent Nation to become the most talked-about nonfiction book of the year.	2001-04-19

I want to cover HTML, web graphics, CSS, and JavaScript.<br />Niederst covers HTML and graphics in depth.  With HTML, she teaches how to create a page, how to format text, how to insert graphics, how to create links, etc.  The graphics section may be the strongest in the whole book.  It is exactly what I was looking for as a resource to explain how graphics are edited for the Web. CSS and JavaScript get only passing attention, but that is probably to be expected.<br />There are a few &quot;modern&quot; tricks that are missing from the book.  There is no discussion of the .PNG standard for web graphics.  There is no discussion of the &quot;link title&quot; tag, which can create a rollover effect with just an HTML tag.<br />Niederst also spends some time on the basics of obtaining server space and putting files onto a server.  I think that this is very important, because this can be the most confusing part about getting started in Web design, and other books generally omit it.<br />I can give this book my strongest recommendation to other teachers of web design courses.  I am sure that I will refer back to it constantly.<br />For students, I'm afraid that it might be too broad, and for beginners my guess is that it would be too overwhelming.  For example, on p.10-11 in discussing what software you need to buy, Niederst lists 3 web authoring tools, 2 text editors, and 5 graphics tools.  Nowhere does she make it clear that you do not need all 10!  As an experienced web designer, I know that it would be silly to work with Dreamweaver(tm) and Frontpage(tm) at the same time.  But that may not be obvious to a beginner.  Nor would it be obvious that if you choose an authoring tool you would not use a text editor.<br />This breadth of information runs throughout the book.  I would think that a beginner would be better off starting with a shorter book that teaches a single approachto page construction, rather than a book that tries to cover multiple approaches at once.	2001-04-05

This would be a horrible time to come out with one of those arrogant, jargon-filled, air-headed books celebrating Internet mania.<br />Fortunately, Tim Burns instead takes a back-to-basics approach to Internet entrepreneurship.  He correctly identifies the genuine characteristics of the New Economy, e.g., &quot;The new organizational wealth no longer centers around physical capital but around intellectual capital.&quot; (p. 22)  But he advocates traditional business discipline rather than throwing the rulebook out the window.<br />In theory, a book about starting an Internet business might have to cover economic theory, business strategy, accounting, law, and finance, as well as describe the technical features and business implications of the Internet.  In practice, an author has to pick and choose.<br />Burns puts emphasis on <br />--analysis of business opportunities (particularly in chapter 2, where he contrasts ten fallacies of Internet entrepreneurship with he calls the &quot;reality-based Internet business model.&quot;)<br />--advice about creating a business plan<br />--principles of accounting (Burns' background is particularly strong here)<br />On the other hand, the discussions of Internet marketing tactics tend to be few and far between. Someone seeking advice on designing and promoting a web site or on email marketing would have to look elsewhere. <br />I think that this book best serves someone who never went to business school and who wants to fill in some knowledge gaps before launching a new enterprise.  It's a lot less expensive than going back for your MBA.	2001-02-23

Taking us back to the days before Samuelson, and indeed before Marshall, he presents economics in terms of logic, examples, and occasional data.<br />Turning to substance, one might fairly ask, &quot;Is this book an economics textbook or a right-wing polemic?&quot;<br />The answer is &quot;yes.&quot;<br />My college economics professor used to point out that the liberal Samuelson and the conservative Friedman believed in the same price theory.  However, Friedman applied it to policy more aggressively.<br />Sowell applies economic theory aggressively to policy, and the chips happen to fall well to the right of center.  But what is there in &quot;Basic Economics&quot; to which a liberal economist might object?  I can only think of a few things.<br />1.  Sowell takes the monetarist view of macroeconomic fluctuations.  He does not mention the savings/investment imbalance theory of Keynes.  But even most liberal economists won't stick up for Keynes nowadays (I will).<br />2.  Sowell points out that social security is an intergenerational transfer, and that its feasibility depends on the ratio of workers to retirees.  Liberal economists agree with this view.  But they still like social security, and Sowell does not deal with their rationale (weak as it may be).<br />3.  Sowell points out that poverty is misrepresented in the media, and that economic growth and changes in lifetime circumstances erase much of what is reported as poverty.  Again, liberal economists would have to agree, but nonetheless they would have put the issue of &quot;income distribution&quot; intoSowell's chapter on the proper role of government.  He never quite meets them head-on.<br />But I wish that liberals would learn &quot;Basic Economics.&quot;  One need only look at the California &quot;energy crisis&quot; to see the consequences of economic ignorance.	2001-02-13

She struggles to be authentic.<br />She knows who she is supposed to be--the proper daughter of a wealthy steel executive.  This being 1957, she is not supposed to be interested in sex without marriage or in getting a Ph.D in English literature.  <br />The novel is very stylistic.  The author slides you back and forth in time so effortlessly that often I found myself several pages into a scene before I realized that the time frame had shifted.  The author's presence is very subtle--you feel as though the story is coming to you right from the characters.<br />Certain stylistic elements are carried nearly to extremes.  It seems that Gloria is always in the process of getting dressed, that kisses are always being described as open-mouthed, and Gloria is always trying to interpret her dreams or reach back into vignettes with her college roommate, Susie, for significance.  <br />I found the psychological drama compelling.  It takes a universal issue (trying to discover and assert one's true self) and gives it a precise 1950's focus.  Part of what makes the novel captivating is the fact that Gloria and many other characters are neither completely lovable nor completely despicable.  You have to keep an open mind.<br />I believe that this is very high-caliber fiction.	2001-02-08

However, the bequest of a wealthy poetess gives Sally an opportunity to revisit the scene (and perhaps the meaning) of her prior life.<br />The plot careens in several directions.  First, Sally renews a relationship with a former boyfriend, whose love-making now combines the mature sophistication of middle age with the stamina of an adolescent.  (Perhaps this is plausible.  I can only testify to the possibility of the opposite mixture.) <br />Next, Sally unravels the mysterious background of the poetess.  Finally, she survives the self-thwarting schemes of a right-wing militia and a selfish set of sexist professors. <br />I can curl up with writing like this (p. 100):<br />&quot;People on the high plains got real squirrelly the week before Thanksgiving.  They knew there'd be a snowstorm that would shut down the roads relatives would try to travel, strand thousands in the Denver airport en route to turkey dinners and family feuds, generally [mess] up everyone's plans and leave the world so [dang] silent and beautiful into the bargain that you felt guilty for resenting the inconvenience.&quot;<br />In fact, I can say without hesitation that of all books in the comic-western/mystery-romance/academic-feminist genre, this is the best that I have ever read.  But you have to be open to that kind of crazy concoction to enjoy this novel.  If you prefer to keep Larry McMurtry, Sara Paretsky, and A.S. Byatt in separate places, then this might not be your cup of tea.	2001-01-08

In my opinion, it contains some valuable research and analysis.  However, ultimately it is an intellectual swindle.<br />Here are the main points, as I see them:<br />1.  Much of the Third World and the post-Communist world has been unable to make a successful transition into the modern economy.<br />2.  In those countries, it is difficult to obtain permits to start new businesses.<br />3.  In those countries, many people have dwellings for which they do not have legal title.<br />4.  The absence of legal title makes the people's assets illiquid.<br />5.  Governments often attempt to enforce a legal system for real estate, only to have the law collapse in the face of extra-legal squatting.  To succeed, a legal system of property rights needs to build on the conventions that have developed around extra-legal squatting.<br />6.  In the United States, this problem of extra-legal real estate ownership existed until nearly 1900, and it was solved by adapting the law to common practice.<br />Fine.  Do you see the swindle coming?  De Soto is going to argue that the magic bullet to solve world poverty is to adapt property laws to give squatters better title to their dwellings.<br />De Soto says that poor people have $9.3 trillion in illiquid assets.  If they could borrow against these assets, as you can in the U.S. with home mortgages, they could start businesses and climb out of poverty.  He says that this $9.3 trillion is much more than can be provided with foreign aid.<br />Two problems with this:<br />1.  Divide $9.3 trillion by the number of people involved, and you get an average of $2000 to $3000 of assets per capita.  There are not many businesses you can start on that.<br />2.  Even in the United States, home mortgages are NOT an important source of business finance.  <br />There is nothing wrong with making it easier for people to start businesses by making permits easier to obtain.  There is nothing wrong with improving the liquidity of assets through more effective legal titles.  But this is not a magic bullet.	2001-01-05

It affected my outlook on treatment, particularly chemotherapy.<br />I am not a doctor or a breast cancer patient, but I think I know something about decision-making under risk.  If you are the type of person who likes to make their own medical decisions, based on information and advice from doctors, this is a good book for you.  Also, if you like to think about quantitative, statistical factors in making a decision, this is a good book for you.  <br />Let me illustrate the point about chemotherapy with a metaphor.  Imagine two people in a car--a driver and a 14-year-old.  The driver notices a bee inside the car, on the windshield.  The 14-year old takes a pistol out of the glove compartment and offers to shoot the bee.  The driver says, &quot;Go ahead.&quot;<br />What's wrong with this picture?  My guess is that the driver has an irrational fear of bees, based on poor knowledge.  The 14-year old has an overblown sense of the value of guns.<br />Oncologists with chemotherapy are like the 14-year-old who wants to shoot the bee.  And many women with breast cancer are like the driver who is so scared of the bee that the potential long-term side effects of the gun don't affect the decision.<br />There definitely are cases in which I would favor shooting the bee (applying chemo).  But I would recommend making your own decision, based on the data in this book, rather than passively accepting the &quot;standard&quot; (which keeps changing to lower the threshold of risk required to supposedly warrant chemo).<br />There is much more information in this book than the data on chemotherapy.  But that information alone makes it highly valuable.	2000-12-07

When I was in high school, in suburban St. Louis in 1967-71, the key question was, &quot;Are you psychedelic or are you soul?&quot;  Although this was not a racial divide in our nearly-all-white school, it was a schism:<br />The soul kids were athletes.  The psychedelics were hippies. Soul was into school spirit.  Psychedelics were into anti-war marches. Soul listened to AM radio.  Psychedelic listened to FM radio.<br />The &quot;soul&quot; kids went to the monthly dances, where the bands always played &quot;Hold On, I'm Comin'&quot; and ended with &quot;Midnight Hour.&quot;  The psychedelics boycotted the dances, and instead hung out listening to our hero Nick play acoustic guitar (&quot;Cowgirl in the Sand&quot; or &quot;Uncle John's Band.&quot;)<br />Dave Marsh is a total partisan for soul in this debate.  His history erases Neil Young, the Jefferson Airplane, and other psychedelic icons.<br />Frankly, I am not persuaded.  I was bored with soul as early as 1966, when KXOK played &quot;The Cheater&quot; (No. 998 on Marsh's list) ad nauseum.  Although I like most of the songs in Marsh's list, if I had to choose between this 50 hours of music and 50 hours of my favorites from the psychedelic era, I would find the latter more interesting and satisfying.<br />On the other hand, the books about psychedelic music tend to be as pompous and vapid as Stephen Stills' monologue on &quot;49 bye-byes&quot; on the live Four Way Street album.  Dave Marsh is much more rewarding to read.  His story about &quot;The Cheater&quot; is so fascinating that I almost can forgive him for reminding me of that infernal tune.	2000-11-19

Just as his earlier book &quot;Microcosm&quot; traced the role of solid state physics in data processing, &quot;Telecosm&quot; traces the role of light-wave physics in communication.  Data processing is about manipulating electrons, and communication is about manipulating photons.<br />3.  The computer age created an abundance of processing power.  The telecosm will create an abundance of bandwidth.<br />4.  Pipes will be dumb.  The purpose of networks is to pump through packets, leaving extraction and interpretation to the endpoints.<br />5.  Fiber wins, copper loses.  Gilder has little patience for DSL, much less ordinary modems.<br />6.  Wireless devices are constrained by power requirements.  This is an important point, easily overlooked.  But as someone who has owned two mobile computers that were ruined by catastrophic loss of backup battery power, I concur.<br />I enjoyed the book because:<br />1.  It helped provide me with perspective on the bandwidth and wireless issues that are becoming more important every day.<br />2.  I like the way Gilder describes how technology evolves.  He does not simply look at the path a technology took and treat it as obvious.  He looks at why alternative paths seemed plausible at the time but ultimately proved less efficient.  You get a grasp of the uncertainty and complexity involved in trying to anticipate which approach will be able to overcome its inherent weaknesses.<br />3.  I like the fact that he thinks in terms of economic implications, including abundances and scarcities.  I don't necessarily agree with his views, and I will have a longer essay (&quot;Techno-mysticism&quot;) on my site about this issue.<br />My only disappointment with the book isthat, like so many lesser pundits, Gilder makes a big deal about the potential to be paged with stock market alerts. Instead, I would like to propose the Law of the Unforeseen Application.  That is, we probably do not know what will be the most compelling application for the high-bandwidth telecosm.  <br />At the dawn of personal computers, pundits did not foresee word processing and spreadsheets.  Instead, they talked about household cooks being able to store recipes.  Stock market alerts strike me as equally insipid.	2000-11-11

This book extends this genre by having the protagonists be aged 60, with grandchildren in the mix.  <br />Reading  &quot;Julie and Romeo&quot; is like reading a screenplay for a Nora Ephron  movie.  You're sure that it's the sequel to &quot;Sleepless in  Seattle&quot; and &quot;You've Got Mail.&quot;  Tom Hanks will have some  grey flecks in his hair as Romeo, and Meg Ryan will need some lines in her  face to play Julie, but otherwise everything is set up for them.<br />I  enjoyed the book.  I laughed.  I bought into the romance.  I was more into  &quot;Julie and Romeo&quot; than I was into &quot;You've Got Mail.&quot;   However, I have a relatively low tolerance for Hollywood manipulation  (don't get me started on &quot;American Beauty&quot;), particularly in a  novel.  I'll be generous and give it four stars, but there are other novels  I'd recommend ahead of this one.	2000-07-31

Among other things, his philosophy is that in addition to looking at the world from your own perspective, you can  try to look at it from a higher perspective, as if you were outside your  mind/body, looking in.  So, when you are facing a particularly melodramatic  moment in your life, while part of you is feeling the anxiety, you also  have this higher perspective that is saying,  &quot;Hmmm...interesting.&quot;  <br />It is especially challenging to include  the &quot;Hmmm...interesting&quot; perspective when confronted with aging  and terminal illness.  Those phenomena are particularly melodramatic.   Thus, &quot;Still Here&quot; would give someone who is new to Ram Dass a  particularly striking illustration of his ideas.<br />For those of us who have  been exposed to Ram Dass through earlier books or tapes (unfortunately, my  favorite old tape, &quot;Who are you?&quot; no longer seems to be  available), &quot;Still Here&quot; is just the same old, same old.  His  philosophy is not different, but now there is a focus on the issue of  aging.<br />What I like to do with &quot;Still Here&quot; is keep it at  bedside.  I might have been reading a magazine about business or  technology, where the tone is very intense and urgent (&quot;this new  trend/development affects everyone--NOW&quot;).  To restore my serenity and  perspective, I will read a section or two of &quot;Still Here&quot; before  going to sleep.	2000-07-26

But like &quot;Bonfire of the Vanities,&quot; the plot is secondary to the humor, the creative style, the zany minor characters, and the cultural  observations.  <br />Unlike Tom Wolfe, Zadie Smith gives her characters a  fairly sympathetic treatment, even as she exposes their flaws and  absurdities.  That actually makes her slightly more enjoyable, at least to  me.<br />If four-letter words bother you, then stay away from this book.   Smith's lower-echelon Londoners cannot speak two consecutive sentences  without using the f word.<br />Otherwise, when people ask me for book  recommendations this year, &quot;White Teeth&quot; probably will top my  list among novels.	2000-07-14

(pause)   They're dumb as rocks!&quot;<br />I guess my point is that the topics of  politics, philanthropy, the Internet, and libertarianism are inescapably  relevant to some people.  I'm guessing that anyone reading this review fits  that description and will like the book.<br />One quote to illustrate both  style and substance:<br />&quot;(Cyber-)libertarianism can also be reframed as  the mind-set of adolescents, with their deep wish for total rampaging  autonomy and desire for simple, call-to-arms passionate politics, where  Good and Bad are clearly delineated--taking for granted that someone else  does the laundry and stocks the refrigerator.&quot;<br />I like the way  Borsook scrutinizes some propositions (such as those of bionomics) which no  longer get examined because they get spouted so often.  <br />At points, she  tosses off some great writing, such as her take on FastCompany and other  &quot;business porn.&quot;  But the book has an annoying number of  typos--it's like the editing is from Microsoft and it's not even a late  beta.<br />Borsook does not offer a sweeping alternative to libertarianism.   In fact, I suspect that if you locked her in a room with a bunch of  conventional politicians, it wouldn't be two hours before she'd be on her  cell phone, whispering, &quot;Hello, Cato Institute?  I need help.  Can you  get me outta here?&quot; <br />I have a sweeping alternative, which I call&quot;Compassionate Libertarianism.&quot;  Look for that essay on my web  site.  But, first, give me a few days to write it.	2000-06-23

To me, it reads like an inspirational autobiography of someone who  once was a drug addict or a prisoner of war.  It's a tale of pain,  degradation, and ultimate redemption.  <br />You see how this comfortable,  middle-class guy lets his need to join the entrepreneurial crowd take him  lower and lower and lower.  He goes past the threshold of pain that I could  have taken and past what he would have believed he could take.<br />Once my  expectations adjusted, I loved the book. He writes so powerfully!  Anyone  with a soul will find the book to be thrilling and moving.	2000-06-22

He suggests that both liberals and conservatives want government to act like an ideal parent.  In the case of liberals, the ideal  parent is a &quot;nurturant parent.&quot;  In the case of conservatives,  the ideal parent is a &quot;strict parent.&quot;<br />I believe that as a  descriptive model, this is very powerful.  That is, my guess is that if  social scientists conducted a survey, they would find a strong correlation  between beliefs about parenting and political orientation.<br />Lakoff goes  beyond the descriptive to the prescriptive.  He says that the  &quot;nurturant parent&quot; model is better for families.  He infers from  this that liberals are correct on political issues.  <br />Lakoff sees the  parenting models as the true basis for policy differences.  Instead, I see  them as symbols that politicians manipulate in order to mobilize  voters.<br />Policies which appeal to the &quot;nurturant parent&quot; symbol  can have consequences which are quite contrary to what such a parent would  want.  See Alan Blinder's &quot;Hard Heads, Soft Hearts.&quot;  Or better  yet, Thomas Sowell's &quot;The Vision of the Anointed.&quot;<br />This book  succeeds as a guide to the process by which politicians can use symbols  from family models in order to appeal to voters.  When you watch  politicians in action, you can &quot;keep score&quot; by seeing how many  times they appeal to each of the two stereotypical models.<br />I believe that  in making the case for the &quot;nurturant parent&quot; model for families  it also succeeds.  As a parent, I do not like the &quot;strict parent&quot;  approach.<br />However, to the extent that Lakoff's objective is to provide a  brief for liberal ideology, with this reader he fails.  To take this step  requires that we accept policies at their symbolic face value (e.g., one  must believe that rent controls are &quot;compassionate&quot;). The reality  is that the state is not a family, and you should not make policy on the  basis of any parental model.	2000-05-16
US	53044858	R21J59BIJAP83X	0691050627	373262786	Irrational Exuberance	Books	5	462	484	N	N	An Act of Courage	Robert Shiller argues that the stock market has experienced a bubble.  He makes his case on the basis of a sober statistical judgement.  However, in layman's terms, what he says boils down to, &quot;If it walks like a duck,  it is a duck.&quot;  Demonstrating the absurdity of today's stock prices  does not require clever statistical modeling.<br />This begs the question of  why a bubble emerged in the late 1990's.  Shiller discusses several  cultural factors such as the ever-higher profile of the stock market in the  media, including the Internet.<br />This begs the question of how it is  possible for so many people wrongly to be optimistic about stocks.  Shiller  cites many findings in psychology, such as Asch Conformity, to explain how  people can listen to others against their own best judgement.<br />This begs  the question of whether it could be Shiller who is irrational.  Shiller  examines and refutes the arguments that pundits have made to rationalize  exuberance.<br />There are three audiences for this book, all of whom will  find it threatening.<br />1.  Ordinary investors.  You will not want to read  this book, because it asks you to confront an issue that you would be more  comfortable avoiding.  However, once you do dive into it, you will be  rewarded with sober facts and analysis that you can use to resist the siren  calls of pundits, brokers, and friends to buy into the bubble.<br />I can  assure you that Robert Shiller did not write this book to make his own  fortune.  The book jacket says nothing like &quot;five strategies to  survive the bubble,&quot; although he does mention some conservative  investment alternatives.  There certainly is no endorsement from Suze Orman  or any of the other best-selling gurus that he swiftly skewers.  This is  just an honest book from a scholar with the highest integrity:  an act of  courage.<br />2.  Economists.  I can see a lot of squirming, particularly as  Shiller discusses psychological studies that undermine the cherished  rationality assumptions of our profession.  Shiller is generous with those  who disagree with him.  He won't say it, but I will.<br />Shame on us.<br />Those  of us who know better have been too silent.  Paul Krugman wastes his bully  pulpit in the New York Times discussing IMF esoterica, and only when  Shiller's book came out did he mention the bubble.<br />Then there are those  of us who don't know better.  The hundreds of finance professor hacks whose  tenure rests on mindless justifications and interpretations of irrational  stock price movements.  (&quot;Events of type X create, on average, $Y of  value.&quot;  Oh, please.)  <br />3.  Policy analysts<br />This book certainly  will not appeal to those who think that the biggest problem we are going to  face in the next ten years is what to do with budget surpluses. Shiller  correctly points out that the social security debate needs to be conducted,  at a fundamental level, about what exactly we are promising ourselves.  The  trade-off between compassion and freedom must be faced.  I wish he had  illustrated this with a spectrum of alternatives--libertarian, socialist,  and in between.  This might have helped flesh out an otherwise terse  discussion.	2000-03-22
US	53044858	R33EOAKCP2BTKU	0812931432	20757289	High Stakes, No Prisoners : A Winner's Tale of Greed and Glory in the Internet Wars	Books	5	7	13	N	N	Important perspective	Charles Ferguson describes how he and his partners came up for the idea of FrontPage (now owned and distributed by Microsoft).  He explains the context in which his business developed, particularly the actions (and  inactions) of other companies, including Microsoft and Netscape.  He offers  his views on policy issues, including how best to break up Microsoft and  how to regulate telecommunications.<br />The most important contribution of  this book, in my opinion, is to help set the record straight about  Netscape.  He explains in detail why Microsoft was a better software  company.  For example, (p. 301) Microsoft will force software engineers to  answer customer support lines.  <br />I completely echo Ferguson's statement  (p. 289) that &quot;The consensus of almost every company that tried to  deal with Netscape is that it was insufferably unpleasant and unhelpful.   Microsoft can be insufferable as well, but its arrogance is grounded in  real achievement.&quot;<br />If you are looking for a history of the  Netscape-Microsoft battle, then I think that Ferguson's account is  infinitely superior to that of the gullible b-school professors who wrote  &quot;competing on internet time.&quot;<br />In fact, Ferguson's overall  history of the 1993-1996 period rings very true.  It is highly insightful,  as is his description of the venture capital process.<br />Ferguson  personalizes everything.  Even though his individual descriptions may be  accurate, I think that sometimes a broader, systemic perspective that  allows for human fallibility is called for.    This book should be balanced  by reading &quot;The origin and evolution of new businesses&quot; and  &quot;The vision of the anointed.&quot;<br />I took particular exception to  the chapter on telecommunications regulation, which had an enormous ratio  of ad hominem attacks to constructive recommendations. However, apart from  that, I believe that his heart-on-the-sleeve style and insightful analysis  make this an outstanding book.	2000-01-15

I am an enthusiastic supporter of most of his opinions.<br />There are one or two ideas with which I disagree.  For example, I believe that there should be  comment forms on sites, and that these should go to high-level executives  (I personally answer comment forms for my business).  If you are getting  overwhelmed with dumb questions, take that as actionable  information.<br />Also, Nielsen believes in treating your home page as an  orientation page. Because the majority of links to our site do not point to  our home page, we cannot assume that the consumer ever will go to that page  during a site visit.<br />Those are nits.  Everything else in this book is  advice that we either have taken or have compromised on taking (not  necessarily the right compromises, either).<br />This book is more usable than  Nielsen's web site in three ways.<br />1.  Screen shots.  Having the screen  shots on the pages is like having Nielsen sitting next to you, jabbing you  in the ribs and saying, &quot;See what I mean?&quot;<br />2.  Time to absorb.   Reading his advice in book format, I have more time to absorb it.  I picked  up on little details (like using Link Titles) and I became more motivated  to implement some of his other ideas.<br />3.  Bookmarks.  I don't use  bookmarks much on the Web (I can't keep them organized), but I have some of  his pages marked, which makes it easy to refer to them.<br />Because of these  usability advantages, the book is value added relative to Nielsen's web  site.	2000-01-12

However, in my opinion, it tells only part of the story.  It looks at how Netscape formulated its strategy, but not at how (or whether) this strategy was executed.  <br />This is like explaining a football game entirely on the basis of the diagrams  that the coaches drew on the chalkboard.  What actually happened on the  field gets no attention.<br />For example, the authors claim that one of  Netscape's strategies was to leverage Internet standards.  However, the  reality is that with its browser Netscape thumbed its nose at Internet  standards, particularly when it dominated the market.  Even today, its  browser generally is seen as less compliant with standards than is  Microsoft Explorer.  <br />Another alleged Netscape strategy was to &quot;eat  your own dogfood,&quot; which means using your own products.  The reality  is quite different.  For example, Netscape released a production version of  Enterprise 3.0 and kept its own web site on Enterprise 2.0 for several  months afterward.  <br />In 1996, a key component of Netscape's web server was  something they called LiveWire, which provided scripting and database  connectivity.  I adopted it for my web site in the second half of 1996.   However, after several months of trying to get it to work reliably, we had  to abandon it, moving to Java servlets instead.<br />Meanwhile, as of late  1997 (when I stopped following it), Netscape's web site still had not  adoped LiveWire.  They let other users suffer with the bugs and problems in  LiveWire, while they ran their own site using the older technology of  CGI/Perl.  That means they spent at least 1-1/2 years in real time  (multiply by 7x to get Internet time) NOT eating their own dogfood. In  contrast, Microsoft used their competing Active Server Page technology  immediately on their sites.<br />To return to the football analogy, my epitaph  for Netscape is that it is a company that told the press and its  shareholders thatit was aiming to play in the Super Bowl, but disdained to  practice blocking and tackling.  <br />While Netscape's executives were  formulating these nifty strategies, Sun and Microsoft were getting their  code in shape.  In my opinion, that is most of the story.	2000-01-09

He used real stories, but he covered the identities with colorful fictional names, such as &quot;Irwin the  Professor,&quot; &quot;Odd-lot Robert,&quot; and &quot;Poor  Grenville.&quot;  The author himself adopted the nom de plume &quot;Adam  Smith&quot; and his book, &quot;The Money Game&quot;  became a best seller  and in my opinion a 5-star book.<br />NetSlaves has all of the ingredients of  The Money Game:<br />--real stories, with names changed<br />--anthropological  insights into a culture that to many people is strange and unknown.  The  descriptions of different subcultures are accurate down to their style of  dress, natural rivalries, etc.<br />--humor, such as the &quot;fun with the  Huns&quot; episode in which some Food and Wine forum participants find that  &quot;their erudite conversational thread about Brie cheese and merlot wine  was cut to shreds by some Hun shouting about the virtues of Velveeta and  Pabst.&quot;<br />The reason I can only give this book 3-1/2 stars  is their  outlook on humanity.  On p.245, they summarize by saying &quot;people are  people.  More often than not, they're miserable, nasty, selfish  creatures...&quot;<br />They describe skilled computer programmers as &quot;a  bunch of overhyped, overpaid nobodies who are screwing the rest of  us.&quot;  In my experience, this is totally wrong.  The programmers who  have worked for me have wanted to do high-quality, professional work, and  where they have not succeeded, it is because I have not done enough to  protect the sanity of their environment.<br />&quot;The Money Game&quot; was a  classic in part because the message was to not take its subject too  seriously.   &quot;Smith's&quot; description of his experience of taking a  beating in the cocoa futures market owed more to Baba Ram Dass than to  Ralph Nader.<br />I wonder what would have happened had the editor been able  to persuade the authors of NetSlaves to adopt a similar point of view.	2000-01-08

The first book, on the origin of new businesses, is a tour de force.  The second book, on the evolution of businesses from fledgling businesses to large enterprises, is not as  satisfying.  I will confine my review to the first book.<br />The author gives  us a new perspective on new business formation.  He discusses five  types:<br />1.  marginal businesses.  These are hair salons, lawn care  services, and other businesses that are simple and small-scale.<br />2.  promising businesses.  These businesses also start out at a small scale,  but they are much more complicated because they are launched in turbulent  markets with high levels of uncertainty.  You are going into a market  before most people even realize that there is such a market.<br />3.  VC  funded firms.  These firms require more capital and a more solid business  plan than promising new businesses.<br />4.  Revolutionary ventures.  These  are VC funded firms on steroids (the venture funding may have to come from  large enterprises), who take large risks while aiming for large  profits.<br />5.  Large enterprise innovation.  Here, established companies  launch new projects, which require large investments but have a high  probability of success (think of Intel maintaining its lead in  microprocessors).<br />This is an excellent theoretical scaffolding, to which  Bhide is able to attach many interesting insights.  Some are statistical.  For example, in a large sample of successful small businesses, only 12  percent thought that the originality of their idea was what produced  success.  The rest attributed their success to &quot;exceptional execution  of an ordinary idea.&quot;  p.32<br />Other insights are anecdotal, such as  the descriptions of how companies adapted to customer demands.<br />If I were  the type who used a highlighter to mark interesting passages, my copy of  the book would be mostly yellow.<br />With its solid theory, statistical  support, and anecdotal color,this book sets a new standard for books about  entrepeneurship.  No professor of business can afford to ignore this  work.<br />General readers may find some faults with this book.  If an  academic tone puts you off, too bad for you.  Go read &quot;Seven Habits in  Search of Chicken Soup&quot; or something.<br />Another shortcoming is that  the Internet receives no real mention.  Email me for references to some  essays on Internet entrepreneurship that I think are fairly consistent with  the thrust of this book.<br />Overall, I give the book my strongest favorable  recommendation.	2000-01-06

He shows how it is driven by emotion  rather than reason.  He shows how liberals close their minds to alternative points of view and to  the unintended  consequences of their policies.<br />While conservatives also can be emotional  and dogmatic, this book describes a syndrome among  liberals that I have  encountered quite frequently. Even if you are a committed liberal, you  could benefit from reading this book to see how you come  across to those  with whom you disagree. <br />I read this book several years ago, and ever  since I have found myself saying, &quot;There is an example of what Sowell  is talking about.&quot;  Whether it is the judge  in the Microsoft  antitrust trial, or the anti-WTO  demonstrators in Seattle, or the parents  at my local high school, Sowell has described the pattern of beliefs formed  by emotion, arrogance, and minds that are closed to facts.<br />I really like  books that expose fuzzy, emotional  biases.  On the left, I like Wendy  Kaminer.  On the right, this book is one of the better examples, perhaps  the best.  This book can justly be called a classic.	1999-12-14

Examples include:<br />Was the invention of alphabetic writing necessary before an abstract religion of monotheism could take root?<br />Was  a printing press needed to make public education economical?<br />Why did  radio (sound with images) survive TV, while silent movies were obliterated  by movies with sound?<br />The most powerful leaders in this century were  Hitler, Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt.  Was it a coincidence that they  came to power in the age of radio?<br />As other amazon reviewers have noted,  Levinson's analysis of the future seems less compelling.  For me, part of  the problem is that he seems to be unaware of some previous writing on  critical topics.  For example, Levinson's discussion of intellectual  property and ownership could have benefitied from familiarity with Brad  Cox's work on Superdistribution or Varian and Shapiro's book  &quot;Information Rules.&quot;  And the issue of artificial life is  discussed more fully in the book with that title by Steven Levy.    <br />Overall, I think this book provides a solid background in media for a  course on the Internet.	1999-12-07

For example, radio was a very centralizing medium, in  part because the ratio of receivers to senders was very high.<br />The ideas  in Levinson's two books overlap considerably.  In &quot;The Soft  Edge,&quot; the organizing  method is historical.  Media are analyzed in  the order in which they were invented.<br />In &quot;Digital McLuhan,&quot;  the ideas instead are organized around various phrases of Marshall McLuhan  (such as &quot;global village&quot;).  Levinson tries to argue that in the  computer/Internet era that emerged after McLuhan's death in 1980, these  metaphors apply at least as well as, if not better than, they did during  the TV era of his heyday.<br />I preferred the presentation in &quot;The Soft  Edge.&quot;  Perhaps this is simply because I read it first, so that the  ideas here seemed less interesting.  Or it could be that the historical  approach is more satisfying.<br />Also, I have to admit that I did not come  away from this book with great admiration for McLuhan.  The man who coined  the phrase &quot;The medium is the message&quot; took the methodological  position that I would characterize as &quot;The aphorism is the  theory.&quot;  I find myself sympathetic with McLuhan's critics who would  like to see the colorful phrases used as an adjunct to the scientific  method, rather than as a substitute for it.	1999-12-02

Examples include:<br />1.  Why did the sight-only medium of silent  movies  get wiped out completely by &quot;talkies&quot; while the  sound-only medium of radio survived television?<br />2.  The most powerful  leaders of the past 150 years were Churchill, Roosevelt, Hitler, and  Stalin.  Was this power due to the nature of radio as a medium, and the  fact that radio flowered when they were prominent?<br />3.  Is centralized  authority in media necessary (because people need &quot;gatekeepers&quot;  to filter information for them) or a result of the economics  of mass media  (the high cost of sending radio signals compared to the low cost of  receiving them)?<br />4. Does information want to be free?<br />Levinson's  answers are not always as good as his questions.  His explanation for the  survival of radio (as a medium you can use while doing something else) was  persuasive.  His view that the leaders of WWII drew their power from radio  was less compelling.<br />Levinson's view of the decentralization effects of   computers is valid.  The opposite view, which is widely held, is a serious  misconception.<br />Otherwise, when discussing the future, Levinson is   disappointing.  He says less than what can be found in other work that  predates his book.  The issue of the future of paper is discussed better in  some of George Gilder's articles in Forbes ASAP, going back to 1994.  The  issue of how to pay for information is discussed better in Brad Cox's work  on what he calls &quot;superdistribution.&quot;  The issue of the status of  artificial life is discussed better in Steven Levy's book on that  subject.<br />If I were teaching a course on the Internet, I would include  &quot;The Soft Edge&quot; as background reading early in the course.  It  would help students start to think about the evolution of media.	1999-11-30

He points out  the psychological techniques used by salesmen.  He  describes the ways that shopping malls program the  atmosphere to get  you to buy.  He describes how  stadium events are used to activate mobs.   He discusses spin doctors, advertisers, and commercial cults such as Amway.   He discusses the  consumer profiling on the Net.<br />An example of the type  of detail he provides is  on p. 96:<br />&quot;Grocery shoppers respond best  to Muzak that has a  slower tempo, making a whopping 38 percent more  purchases when it is employed.  Fast-food restaurants use Muzak that has a  higher number of beats per minute to increase the rate at which patrons  chew their food.&quot;<br />The book is not without its flaws.  For example,   on p. 208 you find this sentence:<br />&quot;By adopting the postlinguistic  currency of an iconic culture, marketers can reposition themselves and  their brands in a manner consistent  with the operating system of today's  point-and-click marketplace.&quot;<br />Maybe I'm too old to appreciate  &quot;post linguistic,&quot; but to me this is just babble. I wish that a  Neil Postman or a Wendy Kaminer would knock some of this nonsense out of  him.<br />Rushkoff's disrespect for language can be found in  the book's  title.  The dictionary definition of &quot;coercion&quot; is restraint by  force or governmental power.  He is talking about something that falls  short of that.  Most of the time, what he means by  &quot;coercion&quot; is  what I would think of as &quot;manipulation.&quot;<br />This is not an  insignificant issue of terminology.  By calling so many things  &quot;coercion,&quot; Rushkoff overdoes it.  I mean, while I find it very  interesting and provocative that Rushkoff draws an  analogy between the  cult-style brainwashing of multilevel marketers and the fanatacism of Apple  Computer owners, I was not persuaded to equate the two.<br />Although the  flaws in this book should not be overlooked, they ought to be forgiven.  He  gives us a great deal to think about.<br />A longer book review is available  from me via email.	1999-11-12

Cox and Alm  argue convincingly that conventional measures overstate the extent of poverty.  The conventional   approach compares income to an arbitrary threshold, the so-called  &quot;poverty line.&quot;  What Cox and Alm demonstrate is that many people  who fall below that line nonetheless enjoy a lifestyle that would have been  considered middle-class or even affluent 25 years ago.<br />Where the book is  too breezy, in my opinion, is in its treatment of the policy implications  of its statistics.  Suppose we take it as proven, based on their data and  analysis, that between 80 and 90 percent of the people below the poverty  line are not truly poor, based on what they are able to consume.  Two  questions arise, which the book fails to answer.<br />1.  To what extent have  government programs, such as social security, food stamps, etc., enabled  these people to escape true poverty?  If  government programs are what has  alleviated poverty, then the official poverty line may still be a valid  measure of the need for government assistance.<br />2. What sort of solution  is there for hard-core poverty--the 2 to 4 percent of the population who   are poor by any definition?  How much of their poverty is amenable to  economic solutions, and  how much of it instead requires medical  treatment--for mental illness, substance abuse, etc.?<br />While Cox and Alm  help set the stage for more informed policy discussions, they do not really  undertake those discussions.	1999-11-02

Some examples of his curmudgeonly  style:<br />&quot;to insist that one's children learn the discipline of  delayed gratification, or modesty in their sexuality, or self-restraint in  manners, language, and style is to place onself in opposition to almost  every social trend.&quot;<br />&quot;question-asking is the most significant  intellectual tool human beings have.

Exactly.&quot;  [Postman's point  being that scientists have to learn to evaluate competing theories, not to  accept the conventional scientific wisdom on faith]<br />Postman disdains the  Internet.

They point out that it is inefficient for me to be able to get book recommendations that are based  solely on my purchase history with Amazon, instead of incorporating my  purchase history with other book sellers or my purchase of other products.   <br />As a result of this inefficiency (among others), they argue that  &quot;consumers will challenge marketers for control of their  information.&quot;<br />Having astutely diagnosed the problems with narrow  corporate ownership of consumer data, the authors fail in their proposal  for a solution.   What they visualize is a broad corporate owner of  consumer data--an &quot;infomediary.&quot;  They view this is an exciting  business opportunity.  This infomediary will combine ownership of consumer  data with functionality that consumers want, such as the ability to supply  recommendations.  They argue that there will be huge economies of scale in  this business, justifying a business plan where you lose lots of money to  acquire customers and then eventually make it back.<br />Instead, I believe  that the business opportunity will be much duller.  The repository that  stores my preferences and purchase history will be something akin to a  web-based service to back up my hard disk drive.  That is, the data will  sit there in case I need it.  Meanwhile, when some other company offers me  a service (such as product recommendations) based on my data, I will send  the service provider a key that will enable them to extract what they need  from my data repository.<br />Suppose that I am correct that the architecture  of infomediation will involve a split, with some firms offering data  storage and other firms offering functionality (product recommendations).   In that case, you will not see the enormous economies of scale.  If you  lose money in one of those businesses to start with, you will keep losing  money.<br/>My experience with McKinsey is that whatever the question, their  answer always is &quot;lose money now to gain market share, and gain it  back later.&quot;  In that sense, I believe reading this book will give you  a good idea of what to expect from McKinsey.	1999-10-14

Contact me if you would like to hear more. <br />I was re-reading Francis Fukuyama's &quot;The Great Disruption&quot; on the airplane the other day, when the pilot came on to the speaker to announce that we were headed into  &quot;turbulence&quot; near our Denver destination.  (The next day, the  storms to which he referred were the lead headline in the local newspaper.)   He requested that all passengers return immediately to their seats and  fasten their safety belts.<br />I glanced in the direction of the bathrooms,  expecting to see people retreat unhappily from the queues to their seats.   Instead, nobody moved from the aisle.  On the contrary, additional people  stood up and joined the lines.  The pilot repeated his warning, this time  more sternly, and still the queue for the lavatory did not diminish.<br />What  I observed was a classic illustration of a central thesis of Fukuyama's new  book.  I was witnessing the dramatic breakdown of hierarchical authority  that has taken place since the mid-1960s. . .<br />if after reading &quot;The  Great Disruption&quot; you do not find yourself bringing it up in  conversation with your friends, then you need to make some new friends who  have more intellectual curiosity.	1999-08-15

In this case, Wendy  Kaminer takes on all of the pseudo-science and pop psychology that  surrounds  the recovery movement.<br />For example, she examines the claim  that &quot;All families are dysfunctional.&quot;  As she points out, this  is an empty statement.  If it is a tautology (true by definition and not  subject to testing), then it is uninteresting.  However, if it is meant to  be an empirical observation, then it has no basis in data (no one ever  defined &quot;dysfunctional,&quot; came up with a measurable indicator, and  conducted a study).<br />Also, her skewering of Stephen Covey, which is  described in someone else's review, is priceless.  She irrefutably exposes  this best-selling emperor's intellectual nakedness.<br />Beyond her exposure  of the intellectual shortcomings of the recovery movement, Kaminer suggests  that it fosters a political agenda that ignores real problems that are  class and gender based.  This is a more speculative thesis, and while I was  not always in agreement, I found the argument stimulating and well worth  examining.	1999-08-12

Why are women not moving faster into the upper echelons of power in business and politics?  <br />The book's underlying hypothesis is that two factors determine the status of women in  the world.  Men exploit women economically and freeze them out of positions  of power; and religion and tribal custom serve to subjugate women by giving  men physical power over them.<br />The book outlines the futures of women as  being determined by how these two factors--economic oppression and  religious/tribal oppression--play out.  The authors use the terms  &quot;growing global economy&quot; and &quot;depressed global economy&quot;  to describe the optimistic and pessimistic cases, respectively, for the  economic &quot;driver.&quot;  They use the terms &quot;individual rights  prevail&quot; and &quot;group rights prevail&quot; to describe the  optimistic and pessimistic cases, respectively, for the extent to which  women's autonomy is respected by religious and political  institutions.<br />This set-up gives rise to four cases:<br />1. &quot;growing  global economy&quot; and &quot;individual rights prevail&quot;:  women  achieve full equality.  <br />2. &quot;growing global economy&quot; and  &quot;group rights prevail:&quot; women achieve economic parity but must go  &quot;underground&quot; to evade the Orwellian repression of their cultural  freedom.  <br />3.  &quot;depressed global economy&quot; and &quot;individual  rights prevail&quot;:  women are able to fend off physical violence, but  economic oppression is overwhelming.<br />4.  &quot;depressed global  economy&quot; and &quot;group rights prevail&quot;:  women are economically  oppressed and physically subjugated.<br />The book stands or falls on its  quasi-Marxist assumptions.  Like Marx, the authors view the world as a  class struggle, and every facet of life is subsumed by it.  Where for Marx  the oppressed class is labor, for these authors the oppressed class is  women.  <br />For example, included in the most optimistic scenario is the  overthrow of science:  &quot;Was science as it is practiced nothing more  than a white male, Eurocentric construct which must be dismantled before it  collapsed and crushed everyone?&quot; (p.122)<br />One is reminded of Hitler's  attack against &quot;Jewish science.&quot;  The authors cannot accept the  possibility that the scientific method is a well-developed manner of  thinking, as opposed to an instrument of class repression.<br />What if the  quasi-Marxist diagnosis is wrong?  What if some other factors account for  the traditional roles of women?  Factors that come to mind include: the  high rate of infant mortality that prevailed until the last 200 years or so  in the West; and the importance of physical strength in warfare up until  very recently, which put men into the military, which in turn acculturated  men to solving problems of logistics, strategy, and discipline that also  were important in business.<br />If these factors were important, then with  the advent of low infant mortality and the diminished importance of  physical strength, the culture is likely to adapt to greater equality for  women.  This will take place without the class struggle envisioned by the  authors.	1999-07-29

Most social scientists would agree with that  assessment.<br />But what about the half that cannot be explained genetically?   The author deals with this in three steps.<br />1.  The _assumption_ that  parenting style matters is attacked by showing that the evidence for it is  merely anecdotal.  Rigorous attempts to quantify the effect of parents fail  to show more than a negligible impact.<br />2.  An alternative theory is  developed.  She suggests, based on evolutionary biology, that there might  be a greater role for peer groups than parents in shaping personality.   This is a very interesting section of the book, because even outside of the  context of the theory, the observations of how groups form and interact are  interesting.<br />3.  The author tries to provide empirical support for the  &quot;group socialization&quot; theory.  Ironically, to my untrained eye,  this evidence appears to be largely of the anecdotal variety derided in  step 1!  And nowhere is there a clear demonstration of the quantitative  importance of peer groups.<br />I believe that the author has succeeded in  raising the &quot;group socialization&quot; theory to the same level of  plausibility as the nurture assumption.  But I came away feeling that  neither theory is well supported.<br />I suspect that we may never prove that  anything other than genetic factors matter in personality. A large  component of the &quot;other half&quot; could be measurement error.  A  physical characteristic, such as eye color, is a relatively well-defined  concept that can be measured fairly precisely.  Not so with  &quot;intelligence&quot; or &quot;aggressiveness.&quot;  These are fuzzy  concepts, measured imperfectly.  The mere attempt to measure these conceptsinduces random variation.  Imagine how difficult it would be to explain  height differences if we weren't quite sure what &quot;height&quot; really  means, and if the measurements were based on rulers with 20 percent margins  of error!<br />Try to read the book with an open mind.	1998-11-25

As they put it,<br /> &quot;Even though technology advances breathlessly, the economic principles we rely on are durable.  The examples may change, but the ideas will not go out of date.&quot; (preface, p. viii)<br /> &quot;markets for information will not, and cannot, look like textbook-perfect competitive markets...&quot; (p. 22-23)<br />In other words, the asylum of economic analysis is still sturdy, even though it may resemble the movie &quot;King of Hearts,&quot; in which the inmates are in charge.  In this case, the inmates are phenomena that formerly were regarded as theoretical curiosities: zero marginal cost, significant complementarity, etc.<br />Mass-market business books instead tend to focus on providing affirmation, not information.  (\\"You can be great, too!  Here is the recipe for success!\\").  Many authors use jargon and metaphors to try to make their ideas sound more radical and important than they really are.  VS offer neither chicken soup nor cyberbabble.  They provide business executives with advice that is unconventional from a traditional vantage point and yet is well-grounded in economic reasoning.<br />As someone who finds pure intellectual curiosity sufficient motivation to read about this subject, I found &quot;Information Rules&quot; to be very worthwhile.  The book is rich with substance, which can be conveyed only superficially in a brief review.  It gave me fresh insights that helped to clarify my thinking.	1998-08-29

I think that a reader who uses this book as a guide to the economic implications of the Internet will be steered more right than wrong.<br />As with all books derived from the McKinsey approach, there is too much faith in strategy as a competitive advantage.  There also is an absence of self-doubt and questioning.  <br />Readers should supply the questions and the doubts:<br />--How long will it take for these changes to unfold?  People have been predicting for several years that the Internet would kill off newspapers, real estate agents, banks, etc.  Last time I looked, those companies were still going strong. --If large firms are in such trouble, why are corporate profits so high? --If markets are so efficient, why are firms swallowing one another whole rather than engaging one another in market transactions?

The past 15 years in this country have been unique in the annals of history in the extent to which financial conditions have been aligned to reward savers and investors.<br /> Given the historical context, the research results are to be expected.
