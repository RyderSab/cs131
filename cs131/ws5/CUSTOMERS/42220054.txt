In fact, it oughta be required reading for anyone about to get married.  It gives the basics on everything from retirements accounts (of all types) to buying a home, to creating your own financial plan, even advice on divorce.  Just about any basic information on finances that a person would need can be found here.  Someone looking for something a little deeper might do well to skim the book to glean usable info and then to find something a little more specific. <br /> <br />As a side note, if you've read this title, skip reading \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Investing Like a Pro,\\" as these two books are essentially the same.	2005-01-31

I wouldn't classify this as a \\"biography,\\" but it was a very interesting tale of O'Hair's life (and death).  I hadn't followed the case against her murderers when it played out; it was quite fascinating to read about it. <br /> <br />Despite what some of the reviewers have written, I didn't think this was a biased book.  Hey, it's hard to portray as a saint a woman as wicked as her.  Regardless of whether you agree with her Athiesm, she WAS an evil, greedy woman who bilked many of her supporters out of thousands if not millions of dollars.  Sadly, it was greed itself that led to her murder.	2004-11-24

The topic itself is quite interesting--during WWII, the author at the young age of 22 shows himself to be a brilliant codemaker/codebreaker, and eventually rises to the highest levels, despite his unconventional relations to authority figures.  The book is not really about coding, however.<br />The book presented a side of WWII that is not often heard--that of the courageous agents dropped into occupied territory to sabotage and to prepare the Resistance for D-Day.  It was especially sad to note that often the author, while preparing them for deployment, knew that their capture by the enemy was imminent, because the enemy had already captured many of their comrades and was forging messages back to London in their names--however, Marks' superiors were unwilling to acknowledge this, for reasons which remain in debate to this day.<br />I have to agree with many of the other reviewers on several points.  Marks' wit, while humerous at times, does tend to get old by the end of the book.  The author was unnecessarily vulgar at times, as well.  In addition, it was sometimes tedious to wade through all the acronyms and code-names.	2004-06-11

However, many of the &quot;stories behind the hymns&quot; are nothing more than a brief biographical sketch of the author and composer.<br />The reason for this is legitimate, of course:  no one has a written account of the author's intent when he or she wrote many of these hymns, especially the older ones.  There are notable exceptions, of course, such as the story behind &quot;It Is Well With My Soul,&quot; one of my favorites.<br />So my recommendation is thus:  take the time to read the book.  You'll learn some history, and probably some new hymns as well.  But, don't be surprised when all you get at times is a background of the author, not of the hymn itself.	2004-05-15

Jayna Davis, over the last nine years, has persisted in uncovering and proclaiming the truth about the Oklahoma City Bombing, something our own federal government staunchly refuses to do.<br />Books like this often are immediately dismissed by so-called \\"intellectuals\\" and other liberal-types as right-wing drivel.  My answer to that is people like that need to pull their heads out of the sand and study the facts of what the author is presenting.  Ms. Davis has done a stellar job of documenting her investigation (in stark contrast to the amateur job done by the FBI and DOJ) and the conclusions reached thereby.  No one with a shred of common sense can say that the facts Ms. Davis present point to two home-grown terrorists acting alone.<br />In short, Ms. Davis has proof (beyond reasonable doubt, in my professional and personal opinion) that a former Iraqi soldier (probably a former member of Saddam's Republican Guard) named al-Huseini helped plan and execute the bombing, and accompanied McVeigh IN THE VEHICLE as he pulled the Ryder truck in front of the fated Murrah Building on April 19, 1995.  Davis' extensive interviews document the other Iraqi collaborators as well, and \\"connect the dots\\" not only to the OKC bombing, but to the later terrorist attacks on America as well.<br />I am NOT a conspiracy theorist, but this one is so obvious it is undeniable.  The federal government, despite having been shown to have conducted an incomplete and indeed incompetent investigation, and in fact having committed outright lying, falsification of evidence, and other possible CRIMES, refuses to acknowledge the evidence Ms. Davis has presented.  <br />I have nothing negative to say about the book, except to say I wish it had a happier ending documenting complete truthfulness from our government.  Ms. Davis, for the sake of America, and for the sake of freedom and democracy around the world, I hope and pray the final chapter has not yet been written.  In a time when the words are so ridiculously overused, your work represents true bravery from a true hero(ine).  God bless you.	2004-05-01

DESPITE the name of the book club from which I purchased the book.<br />I was most disappointed in this book.  I'd rate it &quot;zero stars&quot; if there was such a thing.  I plodded about 1/3 of the way through and got so disgusted with it I refused to finish it.<br />Let me give some examples:  He states on p. 41 that &quot;virtually all biblical scholars&quot; have abandoned the idea that Canaan was conquered by the Israelites (under Joshua), as the Bible teaches.  VIRTUALLY ALL???  The author should have taken a few more math classes in his earlier years...<br />More examples: On pages 62 and 63, the author states that the &quot;exodus from Egypt&quot; and the &quot;pan-military 'conquest of Palestine' have all now been shown to be essentially nohistorical, 'historicized fiction' at best.&quot;  Sounds like liberal drivel to me. <br />And, in a footnote on page 98, the author says &quot;[n]o scholar, revisionist or otherwise, thinks these materials [biblical stories] anything other than 'myth.'&quot;  Well, he certainly hasn't done much research in that area!  I can name dozens of scholars who think otherwise.<br />I guess one reason I was so disgusted with the book was that when I bought it I expected to learn about archaeology from a Christian perspective, not a self-proclaimed agnostic who doesn't even believe in the historical truths in and of the Bible.  All the liberals and the athiests/agnostics seem to rate the book highly.  That, however, is not for me.<br />I won't even bother going deeper into the premise of the book.  Readers of this review who are like me won't care about that anyway, and the liberals are going to flame me no matter what else I say.	2004-04-10

I wholeheartedly recommend this book; however, it's probably so different from anything you were taught in school that it might be difficult to incorporate anything into your writing style.<br />I was never taught logic in school--either high school or college.  Thus, I found the sections on logic very interesting.  The author describes every logical argument you could think of in detail, and (the editor) provides examples for most.  Not easy reading, though--I found myself having to go back and re-read/study portions routinely.<br />As an aside, I think this book, unintentionally, does a lot to point out the failures of modern government-controlled schools. The &quot;trivium&quot; should be taught to all grade-school students.	2004-01-19

I was disappointed in this book.  Several times while reading it I was tempted to toss it aside and pick up something more worthwile, but I plodded through it to the end.<br />The author, a linguist, has an admitted distaste for \\"traditional\\" rules of grammer.  (Which explains why he butchers grammer throughout the book.)  He decrys the degradation of literature (and music), but at the same time his own writing style is casually-styled (he even admits this at the end) and even vulgar throughout.  On top of this, there are numerous places in which he misuses words (e.g., \\"anymore\\" instead of \\"any more\\" on p. 115).<br />From another author on another topic, errors like that would be overlooked.  But, for a LINGUIST writing a book lamenting over the degradation of language???<br />In the end, I had to give him two stars, simply because I agree with the premise of his book.  I just wish it had been better written.  It's not one I can recommend to other readers.	2004-01-19

Lott, a professor of economics, has done some top-notch research into the results of gun-ownership in the United States.<br />Common sense (much lacking in this country, I might add) would tell us that when you give people the tools (and the right) to protect themselves, crime will decrease.  Lott's research supports this, but puts actual figures to the benefit of guns.<br />There is much empty rhetoric on each side of the gun (ownership) battle.  Research such as this is important to show the truth about what's going on.  Simple truth:  Guns save lives.  Yes, accidents happen.  But far more lives are saved (and could be saved if ownership laws were loosened) each year than the comparative few that are lost.  Lott's documents this.  He also tells why some (flawed) studies fail to show a societal benefit in owning guns.<br />By trying to outlaw guns, and simply by making guns harder to purchase and own, anti-gun politicians and other hoplophobes have blood on their hands--blood of thousands of innocent victims who would not have been victimized had citizens not been denied the right to protect themselves.<br />This book would be easier to understand if I'd paid more attention in my Statistics class in college. . . there are a lot of statistical terms therein that were a bit over my head.  But nonetheless, it was well worth reading.	2004-01-04

It starts out with an attack on POTUS, which is almost successful.  What follows is a book full of mystery and intrigue.  The assasins had help from the inside, but who?  The plot is traced to Iraq, which threatens the world with a nuclear weapon, and it's up to the United States to take care of the problem before Israel does.<br />If I say much more about the plot it would ruin it for those who haven't yet read it.  However, it was obviously written before the current war against Iraq, and before U.S. soldiers dispatched Saddam's evil sons to meet their Maker.  Therefore, some of the events mentioned in the book won't match recent history.<br />Initially, I was going to only give the book 4 stars because of the somewhat abrupt ending.  My comment was going to be:  &quot;There had BETTER be a sequel,&quot; because there were so many things left unresolved.  BUT, I heard an advertisement last night for, yes, the sequel!  I'm looking forward to starting it.<br />This book is definately written from a conservative slant--a hard-core liberal might not enjoy it as much as us conservatives.	2003-09-13

If you're a conservative, you'll rave over this book.  If you're a liberal, you'll no doubt denounce it.<br />The book is of course, typical Ann Coulter-style:  an in-your-face, no-holds-barred, usually invective attack on liberalism.  At times it's best to have a pocket dictionary handy--she uses some obscure words sometimes!<br />The point of the book is twofold:  First, Coulter discusses the &quot;controversy&quot; surrounding Joseph McCarthy.  To any objective reader, I think she (and her sources) pretty well settles the discussion:  McCarthy WAS right in his accusations, and the Democrats/liberals of that era were harboring Communists in the top levels of the federal government.<br />Then Coulter goes on to compare that era to what's going on today in the war against terrorism.  Reading her comparison, it seems at times that nothing has changed except we're now fighting Muslim extremists instead of communists.  The tactics and motives of the far left seem to be the same:  Lie repetitously until the public begins to believe it, and launch ad hominem attacks to divert public attention from the issues.<br />Interestingly, I browsed a few reviews before writing my own, and, with only a few exceptions, no one attempted to challenge Coulter's facts; rather, they chose to launch the typical ad hominem attack in a feeble attempt to thwart logic.  Oh well. . .<br />My only beef with the book was that I wish she would have devoted more time to discussing the deep motivations behind liberalism.  Not all liberals are treasonous, and I don't think even Coulter herself believes that.  The vast majority of liberals who hold power in our government are indeed treasonous because they are traitors; the rest of the liberals in this country have to have a different motivation--albeit misguided--probably caused in part by the fact that government schools have taught them WHAT to think, not HOW to think.  Very sad.	2003-08-31

This book is a compilation of short works written by many different writers over the last 150 years or so.  Therefore, the quality of writing varied greatly from chapter to chapter.<br />Each chapter is devoted to a separate unsolved crime (mostly murders), going all the way back to Jack the Ripper.  Some of the chapters were merely a couple of pages, and were unable to do much except describe the bare facts of the case.<br />I had to give this book 3 stars, because some of the chapters WERE interesting.

US	42220054	RSQHCW12U4R9R	0671047310	644541461	The Third Option	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Great storyline.	The &quot;Third Option&quot; refers to the options of fighting terrorism. The first: diplomacy. The second: war. The third option: targeted assasinations. <br />In this novel, Mitch Rapp is part of an operation to assassinate a wealthy German who has been providing aid to Saddam Hussein. During the assassination, his two co-assassins turn on him, and leave him for dead at the scene (of course, he survives). <br />The rest of the book is Rapp's search to find out who was behind double-crossing him, and why. <br />This is the third book of Flynn's I have read. The others I don't think it's necessarily an issue if you read them &quot;out of order,&quot; but in this case, I think you need to have read the others to really understand what's going on here. The order is thus: Term Limits, Transfer of Power, The Third Option, Separation of Power. <br />As in his other books, the only complaints I really have about this book is the totally unnecessary vulgar language, and also the way he seems to end the book too abruptly. I won't spoil the story for other readers, but at the end of the book there is still a BIG loose end yet to be tied up. Maybe it'll happen in the next in the &quot;series. . .&quot; <br />This book was hard for me to put down. Lots of action, and accurate (as far as I know!) in its details.	2003-06-20

I judge how good (or bad) a book is by how hard (or easy) it is for me to stop in the middle and put it down.  All of Flynn's books I've read so far have been difficult to put down.<br />In this book, terrorists have stormed the White House.  The president (barely) escapes into a secure bunker, but communications are cut off.  Therefore, Presidential authority transfers to the Vice-President, who happens to be a spineless idiot.<br />Enter one MItch Rapp, a CIA operative.  Rapp almost singlehandedly defeats the terrorists' plot and saves the president.  (That's about all I can tell you without ruining the story.)<br />Note:  Just in case you haven't figured this out yet, Flynn's books are a quasi-series.  In order: Term Limits, Transfer of Power, The Third Option, Separation of Power.  You don't HAVE to read them in that order, but some events will make more sense if you do so.<br />The only complaints I have about this book, which seem to be common to most of his books, are the totally unnecessary vulgar language, and also the way he seems to end the book(s) too abruptly.  He does so well weaving a story, but when it comes to the end, it's almost like a ghostwriter takes over and completes the story for him!	2003-06-05

But the author did a fantastic job, and I thoroughly enjoyed this book from cover to cover.<br />We often see the Founding Fathers of this nation as legendary, almost mythical figures.  McCullough brings out the humanity in them, especially Adams and Thomas Jefferson, a lifelong acquaintance and sometimes rival.<br />John Adams, the second President of the United States, was one of the most influential persons in the formation of this country, from the passing of the Declaration of Independence, through his presidency almost three decades later.  His refusal to enter into a war with France probably insured the survival of this nation during a very precarious time in our history.<br />Much of the material for this book was drawn from Adams' many letters, to and from Abigail, for instance (they were separated for many years due to his assignments overseas and in the Nation's Capitol), and to and from Jefferson and others.  Historians and biographers of Adams' are blessed in that probably no other figure in history left such a personal record behind as did Adams; his letters, many of a personal nature, numbered in the thousands and thousands of pages.<br />I'd highly recommend this book for anyone with an interest in our nations's founding.  It's well worth the time spent reading it.  As I read the final pages recording Adams' death on July 4, 1826, I felt a little sadness, realizing that the world on that date lost a man who paid a monumentous service to our country, and whose stature few men have since achieved.	2002-12-27

The Bible says that \\"in the latter times, some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils,\\" and that people will \\"not endure sound doctrine, but shall heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears.\\"<br />This is exactly what Hanegraaf is exposing in \\"Counterfeit Revival.\\"  What I love about his books is that he uses the frauds own words to expose their heresy.  He quotes from the leadership of the modern \\"charasmatic\\" movement and shows that it indeed is \\"counterfeit.\\"<br />The book discusses such alleged manifestations of the Holy Spirit such as tongues, being slain by the spirit, spasmodic jerking/twitching, barking like dogs, and other absurdities.<br />It opened my eyes to some of the trash that is being promoted out there as Christianity.  Oftentimes Bible-believing Christians avoid that stuff so well, that they have no idea how widespread, and how widely-accepted, the error really is.<br />I think every Christian should read this book, and then search the Scriptures so he himself knows WHY Hanegraaf is right.

As an investigative reporter, Kessler has dug up facts about the Bureau that most of us never realized.<br />From the birth of the FBI in 1908, to its current leadership under Mueller, for most of its history the FBI has been plagued with poor leadership (Mueller seeming to be a notable exception).  From the illegal and unconstitutional activities of J. Edgar Hoover, to the bungling \\"leadership\\" of William Sessions and Louis Freeh, it's a wonder that the FBI accomplishes as much as it does.  That is a credit to the hard-working agents who make up the Bureau, I suppose.<br />In this book Kessler focuses mostly on the directors and their successes and failures, and how they molded the FBI into what it is today.  He also gives some details on past FBI operations involving spying and counterintelligence.  There is quite a bit of information on recent cases such as that of Robert Hannsen, Wen Ho Lee, and others.<br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who is interested at all in the FBI, or in federal law enforcement.  The book is well written, and did a great job of keeping my attention.	2002-11-28

I'd like to think that a book like this would help Americans wake up, but I'm not that naive. <BR>Emerson seems to have spent much time investigating the radical Islamic movement in America, and their links to terrorism. I applaud his research.  Facts like these need to get out.<br />One comment he made troubled me, however: he stated that he was wrong when he initially connected the Oklahoma City bombing with Middle-Eastern terrorists. Maybe he was unaware of the Iraqi connections at the time of publication--I hope he has learned of this since. (It's clear now how the OKC bombing fit exactly into the scheme that he himself has unraveled, and included several of the same players involved in other terrorist plots.) <br />Most of Emerson's book tracks the flow of money and associations of the terrorists and terrorist sympathizers. He doesn't discuss a lot of the philosophical issues--I guess that could be another book in itself. <br />Emerson reveals how the international terrorist organizations have used America and her freedoms to fuel their hate crimes against America herself, and many others overseas. He shows how the radical Islamic movement has hijacked the more moderate, peaceful Muslim groups, and has almost completely drowned out their voices. <br />Unfortunately, this book doesn't have a happy ending. I hope real life turns out differently. But given the pluralistic, politically-correct quagmire our society has become encumbered in, I'm afraid that may not be the case.	2002-11-17

Books with healthy bread machine recipes can be hard to find. . . this is one of the best!

The onion-thyme bread is one of my favorites!  There is also a recipe for hand-twisted, whole wheat pretzels that is really good too.<br />If you're concerned about the types of foods you put in your body, and love warm, fresh breads of all types, get this book!	2002-11-09

Though it seemed a little disjointed at times, it was interesting reading about some Oklahoma history that usually isn't addressed.<br />The book discusses some of the most notorious black and Indian outlaws (and lawmen) of the Indian (and then Oklahoma) territory.  I must admit that I had not heard of most of the names.  I was surprised to read of how many black men had served as deputy United States Marshals in this region before statehood.<br />The author seems to have done extensive research on the subjet, and quotes regularly from newspaper articles and other writings from the late 1800's and early 1900's.	2002-11-03

I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to learn about the history of modern-day Israel.<br />The author starts at about 1897 with the &quot;Zionist Movement,&quot; and continues through about 1997 and the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin.  He quotes frequently from biographies of such persons as Golda Meir, Shimon Peres, and other influential Israelis.<br />The only beef I had with the book was I wished the author would have gone into more detail on such events as the Israel attack on the Iraqi nuclear reactor, the rescue of the hostages in Uganda, and the attempted rescue of the Israel Olympic athletes in 1972.<br />After reading a history such as this it just astounds me that Israel is still in existence, after (at times) almost the entire world is against it.  Surviving five wars in less than 60 years of existence (and ususally outnumbered), it is a vivid testimony to God's preservation of His people.  Yes, Israel has made some mistakes (both morally and tactically), but there's not a nation on earth that hasn't.  It is also in the unusual position of being the most hated nation on earth.<br />The book is well written, and seems to have been researched extensively.  Again, I couldn't recommend it more for someone wanting to learn of Israel's history.	2002-10-23

What do I mean by that?  <br />This book is a gem, a masterpiece, assembled posthumously after the authors death in the late 1800's.  However the topics within deal with the Greek text, and do so using the Greek alphabet, which I (generally) am unable to read.  There are many quotes in Latin too, and though I can read a little Latin, it's not enough to glean much from this book.<br />The book does a great job of tracing and explaining many of the errors which crept into the Traditional Text of the New Testament over the centuries, and which have resulted in the so-called \\"modern translations.\\"  Almost without exception, all of the \\"modern versions\\" were \\"translated\\" from DIFFERENT TEXTS than the KJV and NKJV versions.<br />Burgeon was brilliant, and a meticulous scholar, too.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who's in seminary and studying Greek.  It'll open your eyes to some things.<br />I must admit, however, that I never completed this book cover-to-cover; I got lost trying to follow the author's Greek excerpts.	2002-10-06

I generally judge a book by how difficult it is for me to set it down before it's finished--this one just wasn't that gripping.  The stories were interesting, but at times it didn't seem like there was enough continuity.<br />In addition, I think the last chapter could have been eliminated entirely.  While the other chapters were generally dedicated to one story per chapter, the last contained a dozen or so stories from the 20th century.  As a result, they were much more brief, and left me wondering about the details that were necessarily omited.<br />That said however, the author did a fantastic job of researching the accounts, especially given the number he covered.	2002-10-05

Not just the story of another shipwreck, this book details the aftermath:  an attempted political whitewash, and the struggle for the truth by those who were involved.<br />What makes this story so tragic, in addition to the many who died, is the fact that at so many points along the way, the calamitous end could have been averted, were it not for selfishness, incompetence, and ineptitude.<br />At the end of the book, the author compares and contrasts the Medusa tragedy with more modern cases of groups being stranded in inclement conditions, including the plane that went down in the Andes several decades ago.<br />I thought the book was well written, well constructed, and it did a great job of holding my attention.	2002-09-21

It's the true story of the 19th century whaleship that was attacked and sunk by a sperm whale, and the 93-day ordeal of the crew fighting to survive (most didn't) in the three small whaleboats.  (And of course, the book \\"Moby-Dick\\" was in part based on this event.)<br />I thought the author did a fantastic job of telling the story, and while doing so injected bits of relevant history and science that helps the reader better understand the story and its context.  It got me interested in doing additional reading on the whaling industry.  (And who knows. . . maybe I'll be able to visit Nantucket someday!)	2002-09-09

I only THOUGHT I understood Mormonism!<br />This book traces the beginnings of Joseph Smiths creation, from his beginnings in upstate New York, to his lynching in Carthage, Illinois.  The author has researched her subject meticulously, as evident by the bibliography.  Many early Mormon writings are quoted, including letters from Joseph Smith himself.<br />After reading this book, I can better understand how people could be deceived into believing the Book of Mormon and other Mormon writings.  It is clearer now how Mormonism got a foothold in America--it was birthed into a sub-culture filled with people who, while professing Christianity, really had little understanding of the Word of God, thus could be duped quite easliy.  (This by the way, is how Mormonism maintains its grasp today.)<br />I don't care how many other books you've read on Mormonism, or how much you think you know about the subject; you need to read this book.<br />By the way, the author does not &quot;slam&quot; Joseph Smith (or his followers).  On the contrary, she seems to have quite a bit of respect for him and what he became.	2002-07-07

But if you're a parent who wants to really do some good for your child, prayer is of the utmost importance.  This book is a good place to start.<br />Stormie talks a lot about her own experiences with prayer in the lives of her children.  This book is divided into thirty chapters.  The first part of each chapter, usually only 2 or 3 pages long, discusses a different area of childrens' lives, and the importance of praying specifically for that area.  Then follows an example prayer, then &quot;Weapons of Warfare,&quot; several Scripture verses on that particular topic.<br />A parent's prayers should go well beyond the examples in this book, of course.  But especially for a new parent, or even a new Christian, this book gives great examples from which to build upon.	2002-06-17

It covers the highlights of each president, but of course in about 400 pages, it's simply impossible to go very deep.<br />The book is arranged, not in chronological order, but in descending order of each president's success in office, as judged by the author, of course.  I probably would have preferred a chronological discussion, for the simple reason that it would be easier to view each biographical sketch in it's larger context.<br />But again, overall it's a good read.  I'd suggest it for anyone who is interested in American Presidential History but doesn't want to read multiple books to get the overview he wants.	2002-06-01

Cloud points out the weak and innacurate arguments in James White's &quot;The King James Only Controversy.&quot;  Indeed, White didn't address much of the strong evidence against the &quot;modern&quot; versions--Cloud points this out.<br />While I do recommend this as the &quot;other side of the coin&quot; to anyone who has read White, I think there are some better and more informative choices out there too.  Cloud has a couple of other books with vastly more information.  I'd especially recommend &quot;8 Myths of Modern Bible Versions.&quot;<br />One negative criticism I had of Cloud's book is that he spent about 30 pages (the whole book is only about 140!) describing in detail the heretical views of various individuals involved in the modern &quot;evangelical&quot; movement, and the wickedness of ecumenism.  While I agree with Cloud 100%, I think much of what he was saying wasn't necessarily relevant to the topic of White's book.  It could have been condensed into at least 10 pages, if not less.  Much of what he was saying was, if memory serves correctly, verbatim out of some of his other writings.<br />The other thing I might mention is that it seemed at times Cloud was maybe a little strong in his PERSONAL criticism of White.  I've read another book of White's, and in general I agree with him on a lot of things (except textual criticism, of course).  I believe that White wrote his book with a sincere and caring (though misguided) heart.  I think Cloud would probably disagree.	2002-04-30

This book is about so much more than just Einstein and his theories.  About the first 100 pages or so is an introduction to physics--everything from the mechanics of light to gravity and uniform acceleration.  It's presented an a relatively (no pun intended) easy-to-understand fashion.<br />A small portion of the book is biographical in nature, dealing with Einstein's personal and professional life.  Even more, of course, is devoted to the development of his brilliant theories, especially the Special and General Theories of Relativity.<br />Beyond that, there's a lot of information on quantum physics.  In my opinion, up to that point, most of the book is written such that the average reader could understand most of it.  Of course, once you get to quantum physics, one might question whether ANYONE could really understand that topic!<br />I would have given this book 4 or maybe even 5 stars, if the author hadn't wasted his (and my!) time with overly-lengthy discussions into &quot;modern psychology&quot; (e.g., Freud, Kant, etc.) and &quot;Eastern mysticism &quot; (e.g., Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, etc.).  While he tries to make a connection between these topics and his discussion of quantum physics, I didn't think it was useful.	2002-04-28

This book tells the &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; of the quest for our past.  <br />Yes, it give information on &quot;Lost Civilizations,&quot; covering everything from the ancient Egyptians, to the Incas and Aztecs, and many in between.  But it also discusses some of the basics of archaeology--which you will discover is much different from the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; portrayal.  You'll learn how artifacts are discovered and dated, and how they are used to construct a picture of what a civilization was like.<br />Full of entertaining facts and trivia, and even pointers on how you as an amateur can get involved in archaeology, I'd recommend this book for anyone who has an interest in the mysteries of our past.	2002-03-16

I'm going to have to agree with some of the other reviewers, who have said that the thing that keeps this from being a fantastic book, is the lack of maps.<br />My suggestion:  Get the book, but get a WWI-era atlas to accompany it!  Some of the countries involved in WWI aren't even in existence anymore, and the book makes a lot more sense if you can picture the different countries discusses.<br />With that said, I do recommend this book for anyone wanting an overview of the War.  Another word of caution, though:  This book doesn't read quite as easily as some of the other \\"Idiot's Guides.\\"  It's written at a slightly higher level, so takes a little longer to get through.<br />It covers the entire time period from the pre-War era and the causes of the War, to the Treaty of Versailles and the post-War activities that actually lead up to WWII.  Lots of biographical sketches and pithy quotes contribute to a well-rounded overview.	2002-02-09

Olsen succintly documents the final days in Clinton's presidency; days that are all too fitting a crown to the eight years he and Hillary reigned.  (And make no mistake about it, \\"reign\\" they did...)<br />Yes, this book is one-sided.  Yes, the author is probably biased.  But sadly, all of what she describes has been documented, and can be confirmed.<br />Olsen touches on several events in the Clinton's last days (and lightly on a few events before that), but the largest portion of the book is spent on the fiasco over the last-minute pardons of drug-dealers, tax cheats, frauds, and fugitives that the Clintons passed out, sold, and traded for votes.<br />(I'll bet you can tell that I'm no fan of the Clintons, huh!)<br />Most if not all of what Olsen talks about was in the media in early 2000, but the events deserve an extra spotlight, which Mrs. Olsen so adequately supplies.  Regardless of one's political leanings, I highly recommend this book.  It shows the debauchery that we can succomb to when \\"It's the Economy, Stupid!\\" and character no longer counts.<br />One last thing:  Call me a prude, but the book does contain some PG-13 language.  While its use is restricted to direct quotes of the characters (primarily the Clintons), there are ways to avoid it.	2002-01-23

It is set up as a reference guide to &quot;difficult&quot; passages in the Bible.  The author is a Fundamental Baptist who believes in the inerrancy of the King James Bible, so right off the bat he's going to get a lot of criticism (as he has already in a review here).  Nonetheless, he does a good job of explaining many supposed &quot;contradictions&quot; in the Bible.<br />Many of the things listed as &quot;contradictions&quot; I had never noticed before.  Cloud admits that some of the passages elude an easy answer; those are the ones we have to accept by faith.  However, for even the most difficult passages Cloud offers one or more possible explanations.<br />I have read several of Cloud's books, and highly recommend them; especially &quot;Rome and the Bible.&quot;  However, I was disappointed in Clouds's lack of understanding of the doctrine of Election, as evidenced in his discussion of John 6 and several other key passages.  He bombs miserably.  Personal Election is taught throughout the Bible, yet Cloud dismisses it with only a few verses, several of which were taken out of context.	2002-01-21

This book tells what everyone outside New York and Washington (and maybe California) have always known, but what the rest can't admit:  That the &quot;mainstream&quot; press is listing left.<br />What makes this book unique, is that it is written, not by a Conservative, but by a Liberal!  I must commend Mr. Goldberg on his honesty--it is refreshing to see.  <br />Mr. Goldberg cites multiple examples of the bias he encountered personally, and the hypocritical way in which he was made a pariah after he attempted to bring this bias to light.  Among other things, he mentions the elite's bias in reporting racial items, homelessness, and AIDS.<br />Lest you think there is some hidden &quot;conspiracy&quot; to slant the news, Goldberg asserts (and quite effectively, I think) that there is not.  Rather, says he, it is much worse.  The media elite are biased and don't SEE that they're biased, and when confronted with it, can't admit that they're biased.  Kudos to Mr. Goldberg for being man enough to admit the truth.<br />I would have given this book 5 stars, were it not for the unnecessary PG-13 language throughout.<br />Hopefully this book will facilitate the already increasing abandonment of the entertainers who call themselves journalists.  Is it any wonder that CBS's ratings are abyssmal?	2002-01-13

A separate (but brief) chapter is devoted to each topic. <br />At the end of each chapter, there are seven specific items related to that area about which a husband can pray.  Following that is a brief testimony from a husband who implemented prayers in that area, and then a &quot;sample&quot; prayer.

If you're wanting an introduction into the controversy over the KJV, I'd suggest Cloud's &quot;8 Myths of Modern Bible Versions&quot; first.<br />&quot;For Love of the Bible&quot; is more of a compilation of biographical sketches and quotes (some quite extensive) from those involved on both sides of the issue.  What I found really interesting was the inclusion of portions of writings from authors that today are difficult, if not impossible, for the average person to acquire.<br />One thing is for certain:  after reading this book, I have much greater respect for the King James Version than I did before.  While I've always been partial to it, now I more fully understand why.  &quot;King James Onlyism&quot; is nothing new, and it certainly isn't the &quot;off-the-wall&quot; stance that many of its detractors portray it as.	2002-01-02

It warns that our society is headed for literal destruction if we don't wake up and, as Christians, make some changes.  Changes that, in today's culture, we may be unwilling to make.<br />What's really sad is that so much that is thrust upon us is indeed &quot;Nonsense.&quot;  And as the title says, it is this Nonsense that is destroying our culture, bit by bit.	2001-12-27

Make no mistake. . . while some of the Arab people may want peace, the Arab leadership does not.  This is obvious when you look at this history of the region.  The only times the Arab leadership has really pursued peace are the (5!) times they've gotten their tails kicked severely after attacking Israel.<br />The dedication of the Jewish people comes alive in this book.  Many gave the utmost sacrifice in contribution to the founding and preservation of the Nation.<br />I recommend this book for anyone who is curious about the founding of Israel.  One warning:  Golda Meir (as were many of the founders of Israel) was an ardent Socialist; this was definitely evident in her book, and was a bit hard for me to stomach at times.	2001-12-22

I have the KJV (2nd printing).  There are numerous typographical errors throughout, and a few instances in which the editor changed words from the traditional KJV text, presumably to make it more &quot;readable.&quot;<br />What really turns me off to it, however, is the commentary.  Often very good, it at times however, is just flat wrong, especially when dealing with the subject of election/predestination.  Mr. Zodhiates is actually almost self-contradictory at points regarding this subject.<br />Given all that, I must say that the concept is a good one; that is, of having the words indexed to a Hebrew/Aramaic/Greek Lexicon that is included in the back.  There have been numerous times I've been able to consult the dictionary in the back, when I did not have the cumbersome Strong's Concordance with me.  The only downside to this is that not every word is indexed.	2001-12-18

This is another of Peretti's books that was almost impossible to put down until completed.<br />It's the story of a down-and-out pastor who is placed in the position of standing against some strange happenings that come town.  Some say they're miracles from God, but he believes otherwise.  As the story progresses, the true nature of these &quot;miracles&quot; is manifested.<br />This book, while fiction, does much to expose the foolishness and wickedness that permeate our &quot;churches&quot; today.  As in &quot;The Visitiation,&quot; much that is called Godliness is in fact from Satan.	2001-12-01

However, after reading Cloud's book, I am ready to state emphatically that I believe that many other &quot;versions&quot; of the Bible (including NIV, RSV, &quot;Living Bible&quot;, etc) are in fact NOT the inerrant, infallible, inspired Word of God, but rather dangerous substitutes.<br />I know that's a strong statement, but I urge every Christian to read this book.  Cloud documents the origins of the KJV and many of the other versions, and also documents the differences between them, both in origin and content.  (For example, many if not most of the &quot;modern versions&quot; were actually translated by NON-BELIEVERS AND/OR HERETICS!)  As in the other books I've read by the same author, he makes extensive use of direct quotes from other sources to bolster his arguments.<br />This book opened my eyes to a lot of information that I was not aware of.  The information contained therein is vital to any true student of God's Word.	2001-12-01

This is the first book of Clark's that I have read, and am looking forward to reading more of his writings.<br />Clark presents, in a logical fashion, his case supporting the Biblical doctrine of Predestination, and quite effectively, in my opinion, destroys the arguments of its opponents.  In a case such as this, the only appropriate argument is one based in Scripture, and Clark does exactly that; he presents the Scriptures that form the &quot;backbone&quot; of the Doctrine, and also many other supporting verses, sometimes bringing out concepts that I had never noticed before.	2001-11-28

It lays out the basis of our salvation and our faith in Christ.<br />However, it is probably not a book to read while lying by the pool.  You must spend extra time reading it in ordert to comprehend the author's (and translator's) meaning.  It's the type of book that's easy to get frustrated with and simply put down.	2001-09-02
