One can always find quibbles with the alternate history, but the overall effect is powerful.<br /><br />There are many reasons to read this book: for the alternate history, for the fascinating characters, for the intricate plot, for the suspense.  I do want to warn the squeamish that this book contains explicit depictions of torture and sex and murder.  Ethical issues are handled with nuance, but none of the characters have a strong moral center.  Similarly, religious discussions between characters are also nuanced, with the main character gaining some sympathy for theism (though not converting) but the religious are cultural Christians, and the Cause, not Christ is the driving force in their life.  This is not a book for high school libraries.	2005-09-09
US	52912953	R1JMUS59FIDNMX	0312890788	431768961	The Big Time	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Clean, interesting	This book deals with an interesting concept (the meaning we assign to the past) in an interesting way (time travel war).  It has no sex, cruel violence, or foul language to distract from these themes.  Leiber strips away all the usual sources of meaning for a lives, but the concluding chapter offers us only superficial existentialist philosophy to stand in for a \\"solution\\" to this problem.  It is only one step away from nihilism.  In a sense, the book reveals to us how important it is to have a past and how deeply that past shapes the meaning of our lives (which may have been the effect Leiber intended).  Recommended for middle and high school libraries.	2005-07-22

It includes scenes of torture, sexual situations, and vulgar language that are not appropriate for younger readers or listeners.  Guerin Barry is superb with male voices, but not with female voices.  This is not a story with any deeper themes--the protagonist doesn't really grow as a character--he merely survives.  People who like realistic political thrillers may also be disappointed.  But if you need something for the road, this may do nicely.	2005-07-22

This is a heartwarming story of how a little community of lonely people forms around a friendly and ugly stray dog.  All of the characters possess a bit of wisdom of their own, but as they come together in friendship they all grow a bit.  At the heart of the story, however, is the relationship between a father and daughter who are both dealing with deep pain resulting from their wife/mother having abandoned them seven years earlier.  The book chronicles their movement toward hope and redemption with the help of that friendly dog.  Even adults risk some moist eyes, but dog-lovers need not fear (too much). I highly recommend this book to children and young adults and especially to elementary and middle school libraries.	2005-07-22

Books	4	12	16	N	N	Good introduction	Walter Kaiser believes that the Old Testament documents are both reliable and relevant for Christians today.  While he does not try to \\"prove\\" the infallibility of the Old Testament scriptures, his argument in favor of their reliability and relevance is generally persuasive.  Especially fascinating is some of the supporting archeological evidence, such as Baruch's bullae and investigations into the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.  Kaiser also notes problems with the evidence when applicable; for example, the dating of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and various \\"missing people.\\"  His argument is weakest in regards to Genesis 1-11 for several reasons.  First he argues against those who hold that certain portions of early Genesis are \\"scientific impossible.\\"  But the main problem with these portions is not their scientific impossibility, but the lack of scientific evidence in favor of the biblical account.  While this is problematic for the long lifespans and early iron-working, nowhere is it more devestating than for the universal flood story-a story that Kaiser overlooks completely!  Moreover, while arguing in favor of Moses authorship for the Pentateuch, Kaiser dismisses the various \\"strands\\" that provide the support for the JEDP hypothesis.  Kaiser does rightly expose some flimsy assumptions of the JEDP hypothesis; however, the existence of various strands in the text do not necessarily undermine support for Moses' authorship (for which Wright argues).  It certainly seems plausible that Moses collected various written or oral traditions when writing and compiling the Pentateuch, and so a wholesale dismissal of the JEDP hypothesis might be hasty.  Despite these flaws, this book remains a good introduction to the topic.	2005-06-29

His thesis--\\"the Old Testament tells the story which Jesus completes\\" (2)--is well defended on every page.  I especially valued his insights into how Jesus rooted his identity in both God's declaration at his baptism as well as scriptural promises regarding Isaac, David, and the \\"servant of the Lord\\" (from Isaiah).  Highly recommended.	2005-06-29

Unlike other scholars, Kaiser believes that the Old Testament has a unifying theme and that the theme is--what he terms--God's promise-plan.  The Old (and New) Testament records the progress of this promise-plan, first hinted at to Eve, but explicitly promised to Abraham and David.  Kaiser relates all portions of the Old Testament to this promise-plan, although the wisdom literature is somewhat weakly tied into it via the concept of \\"the fear of the Lord.\\"  Kaiser is correct in searching for unifying themes in the scriptures and he clearly desires that these themes develop naturally from the text rather than be forced upon it from the outside.  His love for the scriptures and desire to take them seriously is evident throughout.	2005-06-29

In contrast to this practical minimization of the relevance of the Old Testament in the modern church, he declares that \\"there is real movement of God toward humankind and a real fellowship between them\\" (18) in the Old Testament.  As he explores such overlapping themes as God's self-revelation, sin, the covenant, piety, worship and the hope of Israel, Dyrness draws attention to this movement of grace and fellowship between God and humanity.  Although he is a systematic theologian by training, he takes the Old Testament at its own words, rather than trying force a systematization on it.  In so doing, he generally avoids sectarian dogmatism, although on rare occasions something he says could be controversial for an evangelical Christian (e.g., his dismissal of theistic evolution (79)).  What shines through on nearly every page, however, is his erudition and deep insight into Old Testament theology.  I highly recommend this books to students of the Bible.	2005-05-13

Although the overall impression of the Catholic church is not negative, the book does strongly favor certain reforms (e.g. married clergy).  The traditionalist position lacks any kind of strong defense, however.  More importantly, the book has the Pope say (in private) at one point something to the effect that faith and piety are really all that is needed.  This just seemed a bit unbelievable to me.  But most troubling of all, the book lacked any sense of spiritual transformation.  Yes there were a couple of miracles, but the idea that someone could be healed internally, overcome sin, and learn to forgive was not really explored.  The main character, Brother Paul, saves the Pope in the end, but he doesn't really learn anything from the experience, and in the final analysis, that's what made this book a bit disappointing.  This book also contains cursing, scenes of torture, rape, and death, and references to consensual sex involving Catholic clergy and unmarried laity.	2005-02-12

The science (mostly archeology in this case) is good enough to allow suspension of disbelief, but ultimately it is not really believable.  The existential theology behind the book is superficial, and traditional religion suffers one serious attack when a key character declares that it is motivated by fear and encourages hate (this opinion is never rebutted by other characters).  This book contains multiple sexual situations (at times somewhat graphic) and profanity, so middle and high school librarians might want to pass on it.	2005-01-30

And the question that Moore asks (and answers at the very end): is it possible for him to find salvation?  What I like about this book is that it explores the boundaries between human wickedness and repentance in the personality of Brossard, the French Nazi sympathizer responsible for the deaths of some Jews during the Second World War. Although some Catholics help Brossard, their motivations for doing so are well-explained.  This book is generally but subtly sympathetic to Catholicism overall.

This is quality Christian fiction.  Sure the plot is just a bit far-fetched, and the atheist character is more a caricature than a character with depth, but the main characters are believable. The book contains nothing offensive, that is, nothing except murder which is not glorified. Although not stated the church in which the story takes place is apparently a Protestant church, but the Catholic G. K. Chesterton is praised herein.  Anti-abortion activity is mentioned in passing with sympathy. I recommend this book for elementary, middle and high school libraries, especially Christian schools.	2004-12-27

Somewhat quaint, perhaps, by today's standards, this science fiction-mystery makes a virtue of initiative and includes many traditional 1950s themes such as telepathy, robots and star travel.  Generally areligious (although obviously materialistic, it contains only one passing snide remark towards religion) and without sexual themes or foul language (which mars so much of modern science fiction), this book is appropriate for youth as well as adults.	2004-10-30

Moore does well in contrasting the alien cultures of the Algonkin and the French.  Both sets of values are taken seriously, and ultimately it is sacrificial love that offers hope that the cultural chasm can be bridged. While the Jesuit's journey does challenge his faith, it does not destroy it.  Please note that this book does contain explicit sexual scenes and foul language.  The sex scenes are not meant to titillate but to develop moral and cultural conflicts, and the foul language is used because that is how the Algonkin talked.  This book would not be appropriate for high school libraries.	2004-10-25

The two locales are meant to contrast and draw out the character of the protagonist, Virgil Caudill.  The book is character-driven, although there are a few scenes of tension.  The key question Virgil must answer is \\"Who am I?\\"  The moral themes in the book are a bit ambiguous.  While the book is infused with a moral dimension, very little time is spent in moral reflection.  Guilt exists, to an extent, and it haunts Virgil, to an extant, but here most of I all I feel the book falls short in exploring the consequences to the soul of Virgil's actions. Please note that the language and the description of a sexual encounter between a man and a dog would not make this book appropriate for high school libraries.	2004-07-02

The murder of Jews and the destruction of the European Jewish community were \\"ends in themselves, ultimate goals of\\" Nazism (13).  Consequently, she takes to task historians and others who deny the uniqueness of the Jewish experience.  \\"By equating the destruction of the European Jews with other events, they succeed in obscuring the role of anti-Semitism in accomplishing that murder\\" (17).  Even good-natured attempts to recognize the potential of terrible evil within every nation or society hide the reality of virulent racism as a causal factor in the case of the Holocaust.  For her, the ideal history of the Holocaust would include three components: \\"(1)  an exposition of how and by whom the European Jews were annihilated; (2) an explanation of why they were annihilated, with reference to the history of anti-Semitism; and (3) an appropriate account of their history before the rise of Hitler\\" (25).  Unfortunately, she found few works that did justice to their subject.  I recommend this books to students and teachers of the Holocaust.  In particular, secondary school teachers may find it helpful in searching for bias within their own lessons and their students' assigned texts.	2001-07-07

The book is very short and the print rather large, making this an easy read.  Robert Rutland dwells mostly on Mason's public life, only hinting at his private life.  Like Jefferson, Mason was a slaveholder who abhorred slavery (he wished the Constitutional Convention had abolished it), but Rutland leaves this paradox unexplored.  For those of a scholarly bent, the book lacks footnotes.  Mason was the moving force behind Virginia's Declaration of Rights, and, for that reason alone, is quite significant.  Any person wishing to learn more about him will find this book a good place to start.	2000-12-31

No matter.  This is an excellent book and well worth reading.  While Owings is much more &quot;present&quot; in the book than your typical historian, she writes with a raw honesty that compensates for any lack of subtlety on her part.  Fundamentally, her work is an exploration of complex ethical decisions and her own reactions to them. Their story becomes part of Owings's story, and that's what history is all about.  Some reviewers criticized her for not writing the book they wanted her to write.  This is an unfair criticism, but does show that the topic is not exhausted.  Another reviewer criticized her approach to oral history, with which, as a historian, I found no fault.  I highly recommend this book for lay readers with an interest in the social history of the Third Riech.  Readers who liked this book may also like Philip Hallie's LEST INNOCENT BLOOD BE SHED.	2000-12-21

In this readable study, Arthur Zilversmit tells the story of the abolition of slavery in the North.  Slavery in the North is a generally overlooked and forgotten chapter in the history of American slavery, and Zilversmit's work is one of the few on its abolition.  He contends that slavery was profitable in the North, and in some areas, entrenched.  As such, abolition met with serious opposition, especially in New York and New Jersey.  Moreover, Zilversmit argues that Revolutionary ideology significantly aided the work of gradual abolition.  He also notes how far some of the northern abolitionists had come toward advocating the essential equality of the races.  Such enlightened views are interesting in light of the abuse abolitionists would receive in the North in the antebellum years.  I recommend this work to all students (and teachers) of American slavery and abolition.  If you are unable to find a copy of this book, you might want to try Joanne Pope Melish's DISOWNING SLAVERY: GRADUAL EMANCIPATION AND &quot;RACE&quot; IN NEW ENGLAND, published in 1998.	2000-11-19

Yes, this work is derivative.  If you haven't yet read  Tolkien's masterful and superior LORD OF THE RINGS, please read it first.  That said, however, I still enjoyed this book, particularly as it warmed  up.  Like Tolkien, this is good, clean fun.  Not only is there no sex, but  one character even refuses to ambush the enemy because it is too much like  murder.  Most of the sorcery is associated with evil, and Truth even has an  important role in defeating the bad guy.  Positive character traits such as  courage, loyalty, and responsibility are seen as things of value.  Some  younger children may find the language and plot more accessible than  Tolkien; some adults may find it more superficial.  But if your looking for  some good wholesome fantasy, this book may be for you.	2000-08-16

It includes the brilliant C. S. Griffin's original &quot;Religious Benevolence as Social Control,&quot; written while he was  still a graduate student and first published in 1957.  This essay, as well  as his THEIR BROTHERS' KEEPERS (published a few years later), shaped the  historiography for years to come.  In it, Griffin argued that reform was  the means used by Eastern religious elites to control the fast-changing  society.  Even as late as the 1980s, some believed (somewhat doubtfully)  that the &quot;social control&quot; school was still the dominant  interpretation of antebellum reform.  Also included is the most  controversial chapter from Avery Craven's THE COMING OF THE CIVIL WAR, in  which he claims that fanatic abolitionists, motivated by psychological  maladjustments, were responsible for the Civil War.  Martin Duberman's  excellent &quot;The Abolitionists and Psychology&quot; is included to  provide a counterpoint.  Rounding out the collection are other essays and  chapter excerpts from such eminent scholars as Silvan Tomkins, Frank  Thistlethwaite, William McLoughlin, Lee Benson, Joseph Gusfield, David  Brion Davis, and John L. Thomas.  All in all, this is an excellent  compilation of interpretative essays from (mostly) mid-century scholars.  Books like this, however, are becoming obsolete as the internet makes  journal articles more widely available to students and academics.  Nonetheless, any serious student of antebellum reform needs to be familiar  with the contents herein, and nothing beats a good book for convenience.	2000-07-17

Shorter than the other two attempts (Alice Felt Tyler's outdated classic FREEDOM'S FERMENT and Ronald Walter's AMERICAN REFORMERS), he emphasizes  the ironies of reform: the religious roots yet secular forms, the  conservative self-image yet radical tendencies, the anti-institutional bias  yet creation of enduring institutions.  He seeks to find middle ground  between historians who have highlighted the reformers' fear and desire for  social control and those historians who stressed the reformers' hope and  benevolent intentions.  At its heart, he sees (most of) the antebellum  reformers as true heirs of the  American liberal tradition, by which he  means the attempt to ameliorate harsher aspects of capitalism through  collective and government action.  (For a scholar who disagrees, at least  for some of the reformers, see Leo Hirrel's CHILDREN OF WRATH.)  Mintz  succeeds in creating a readable and informative synthesis of the  historiography in which the reformers are viewed sympathetically as worthy  of our respect, however flawed they might have been.  Yet, for all his  consensus-building, some readers may find this book unsatisfactory in that  too many questions are only treated superficially: What really motivated  the reformers?  How successful were they?  What can they teach us today?  That's okay.  These questions are really topics for different kinds of  books.  An important purpose of a broad survey text like this is to prompt  some readers to explore the topic in more depth, and I believe that Mintz  has succeeded in this purpose.  I recommend this work as a solid  introduction to antebellum reform.	2000-07-15

Antebellum reform in the North has been difficult enough to understand, so  it should be no surprise that few scholars have dared to reconcile the  reform impulse in the North and South.  Even admitting that the reform  impulse existed in the South has been a somewhat recent development in the  historiography (for examples, see Anne Loveland's Southern Evangelicals and  the Social Order, Stanley Harrold's Abolitionists and the South, and Janet  Cornelius Duitsman's Slave Missions and the Black Church in the Antebellum  South).  Quist, however, tackles the problem head-on by comparing reform  in two counties, one in Alabama and one in Michigan.  That he finds  significant differences should surprise no one.  That he also finds  striking similarities, however, may require us to do some rethinking about  reform in the antebellum South.  Just as in the North, he sees reform in  the South as &quot;compatible with the demands of market behavior.&quot;  His study is truly pathbreaking in that it opens up new territory and  problems to explore.  Because of Quist, any comprehensive account of  antebellum reform will need to incorporate the Southern reform experience.  I highly recommend this work to students of antebellum reform.	2000-07-15

Much of the work focuses on Egypt, as that great ancient civilization left more records for historians  to work with.  But the rest of Africa is not forgotten; indeed, the state  of historical research (which often relies heavily on archeology) is nicely  summarized for all regions in Africa.  At times the writing is a bit dense  or dry, but these sections may be skimmed or skipped with little loss.  At  other times, the work is most enlightening; such as, to take but one  example, in a section on ethnic origins of the peoples in Madagascar.  The  book substantiates the thesis that the histories of various regions in  Africa are all inter-connected and provides strong support that Africa did  indeed contribute to Western civilization.  While the work is, in a sense,  a defense against racist interpretations of Africa's past, it resists  making exaggerated claims.  I recommend this work to general students of  African history and secondary education teachers who might wish to add some  depth to their lessons.	2000-07-13

Supported by inventive statistical research into antebellum revivalism, Thomas argues that in times of  cultural change, the more a movement is similar with the surrounding  socioeconomic culture, the more people it can mobilize in support.  Consequently, he rejects &quot;crisis-theories&quot; that maintain  antebellum revivalism was merely a response to dramatic socioeconomic  change.  Rather, antebellum revivalism was successful because it had a high  degree of similarity with the new socioeconomic order.  Ultimately, he  offers a model of social organization that does not require every human  motivation be reduced to material self-interest.  Thomas's insights into  antebellum revivalism are convincing, and his work deserves more attention  than it has received in the historiography of antebellum reform.  I  recommend this work to students of antebellum religious history and the  sociology of religion.	2000-06-25

Investigating the social, economic, and  intellectual currents of antebellum western New York, he argues that  settlers on the primitive frontier did not have time to engage in religious  and reform enthusiasms.  Only with the coming prosperity did settlers  divert their attention to these matters.  Moreover, the New England  heritage of the &quot;Yorker&quot; settlers greatly influenced their  openness to the revivals.  Despite some flaws in the work, his correction  to the frontier thesis was convincing, but I believe that his greatest  contribution to the scholarship was his demonstration than meaningful  investigations into the reformer's mind were possible.  Cross was one of  several students of the great Arthur Schlesinger Sr. who criticized the  frontier thesis: for others, see Timothy Smith's Revivalism  and Social  Reform (1957) and Charles Foster's Errand of Mercy (1960).

According to him,  the evangelists were pessimistic and intolerant, leaving a legacy of moral  absolutism which frustrated modern thinking.  (But lest you judge too  quickly--by &quot;modern thinking,&quot; he meant the oversimplification of  issues during the McCarthyist era in which he wrote.)  Moreover, his study  might have benefited from a clearer choice of subjects.  At one point, he  assigned to the northern evangelists some responsibility for  &quot;irrepressibility&quot; of the Civil War, yet earlier he had admitted  that these same people had divided over the slavery question.  The work  later became associated with the &quot;social control&quot; school of  antebellum historiography, primarily because of Cole's unsympathetic  approach and depiction of reformers as conservatives.  Unlike the social  control thesis, however, the underlying assumption of his work is that  ideas motivate people.  I recommend this work for serious students only.  The social control thesis is best summarized in C. S. Griffin's superior  Their Brothers Keepers (1960).  More recent interpretations of antebellum  reform can be found in Steven Mintz's Moralists and Modernizers (1995) and  Robert Abzug's Cosmos Crumbling (1994).	2000-04-12

Bodo contends that these &quot;theocrats&quot; sought to order antebellum society according to their own pattern through the work of  voluntary societies.  He finds that these men supported the status quo  through moral reforms which might have had social implications but were  primarily about personal behavior.  Almost hidden in his work, however, are  some important insights about the response of the religious imagination to  social change.  While fear is not absent in the motivation of the  reformers, Bodo emphasizes the role of ideas.  In the end, he finds some  good to say about these apparent conservatives.  Partly by circumstance,  his work came to be associated with C. S. Griffin's social control thesis  in the historiography of antebellum reform, an association that fails to do  justice to Bodo's own insights.  I recommend this book for the serious  student of antebellum religion and reform.  Other reader's might prefer the  more recent Cosmos Crumbling by Robert Abzug.	2000-04-05

Barnes made several important  contributions to our understanding of reform, not the least of which was  the discovery of that great antislavery activist Theodore Weld, who Barnes  continually contrasted to the better known, but in Barnes's opinion  less-deserving, William Lloyd Garrison.  Moreover, Barnes demonstrated the  crucial importance of moral sensibilities as a motivating force for reform.  From start to finish, his work was a calculated assault on the Beards'  economic interpretation of the Civil War found in their Rise of American  Civilization.  (This is particularly ironic since Gilbert Barnes was an  economics professor at Ohio Wesleyan).  Most importantly, in my opinion,  Barnes was the first modern scholar who connected antebellum reform with  revivalism.  New at the time, this notion became so widespread that later  scholars missed the revolutionary quality of Barnes's work.  Of course this  work has its problems; his vilification of Garrison was overdone, and his  emphasis on the northern context of antislavery unintentionally diverted  attention from the conditions of slavery itself.  And while he connected  reform with revivalism, he could not explain the inner dynamics of this  connection and so resorted to truisms.  For me, these problems nonetheless  pale in comparison to the remarkable contributions that this book made to  our understanding of this important moment in our history.  I highly  recommend this work to students of antislavery, the Civil War, and  antebellum reform.	2000-04-04

S. Griffin or Charles Foster.  In antebellum revivalism, Smith discovered little that religious elites could control or  exploit, but rather saw the reform impulse as a constructive Christian  response to the problems of the age.  Furthermore, he virtually rejected  Turner's frontier thesis as applied to church history, believing that  late-antebellum revivalism and reform were urban phenomena stimulated in  part by events across the Atlantic.  Finally, Smith emphasized the  importance of widely-held theological ideas as sources of social behavior.  His work is an important contribution to the social organization approach  to antebellum reform, but like the work of many church historians, it has  not received its fair share of attention from other scholars.  I highly  recommend this work for students of antebellum religion and reform.  My  main criticism is that it dismissed too quickly the theological influence  of Calvinism in reform thought.  For an interesting counterpoint, see Leo  Hirrel's Children of Wrath.	2000-04-03

Paul Johnson's highly readable case study of Finney-inspired revivals in Rochester argues that these revivals were a response to the breakdown of social relationships involving work.  His research finds that the revivals  converted the relatively stable entrepreneurial class of Rochester who had  recently abandoned former traditional employer-employee relationships where  the employee boarded within the home of the employer.  The revival  legitimized this abandonment (and the resulting free labor system) by  emphasizing the individual's moral freedom.  Furthermore, the revival  united the entrepreneurial class behind a mission-oriented Protestantism  that enabled them to assert economic pressure, and a measure of social  control, over the working class.  While clearly sympathetic to the working  class perspective, Johnson does not create a Protestant hegemonic  conspiracy where none existed.  Although one may dissent from his  fundamental assumptions and approach, Johnson's argument is quite effective  within the framework he has set for himself.  I recommend this work to  students of religion and society and antebellum reform.	1999-08-19

Robert Abzug's fresh approach to antebellum reform illuminates some of its  underlying causes.  Abzug explores the antebellum religious imagination,  positing that the reformers set about &quot;sacralizing the  world&quot;--radically joining Heaven and Earth.  In antebellum America,  the language of religion, politics and science all reinforced each other.  Abzug argues that Lyman Beecher confronted the crisis in New England  identity by transferring its spiritual identity as a spiritual Israel to  all of America.  This sense of mission then drove the evangelical program  of reform.  Likewise, William Lloyd Garrison re-imagined the basis of  American society by advocating a radical egalitarianism--blacks were  entitled to all rights of citizenship.  Abzug argues that all reforms  sprung from the wellspring of religious imagination.  Reformers were  rethinking church and society.  Inspired by their visions, they set out to  remake America.  Abzug is convincing.  My one main criticism is that Abzug  did not set American reform in its larger context.  Many American reformers  were indebted to their European counterparts.  What of the European  religious imagination?  How was it different from the American?  Nonetheless, this shortcoming is small given Abzug's deep insight into  American reform.  I highly recommend this work to students of antebellum  reform or American religion.	1998-10-04

He seeks to explain why did some people want to tell  others what to do and how did they go about it.  He argues that a fear of  change, a desire to help others, and self-interest (perhaps unconscious)  united to motivate in America's antebellum trustees of morality.  These  trustees organized volunteer benevolent societies to act as agents of  change in the culture at large.  Through the societies, the trustees used  both persuasion and legal coercion to conform the nation to their  Protestant vision.  While much of Griffin's analysis is useful, this work  is unfortunately characterized by a negative bias against the moral  stewards.  As such, I tend to agree with Robert Abzug's assessment that the  &quot;emphasis on social control is...simply a value judgment cast in  sociological jargon.&quot;  In addition, Griffin fails to adequately  explain the popular appeal of some of the reforms nor the conflict among  the reformers over competing visions of Protestant America.  Ultimately, I  found this work unconvincing.  Nonetheless, this work is very important in  the historiography of antebellum reform and ought to be read by serious  students.  Readers interested in the underlying causes of antebellum  reformed may find Robert Abzug's Cosmos Crumbling more satisfying.	1998-10-04

While many more recent monographs shed new light on the  topic, Tyler's lengthy work remains highly valuable for the student of the  period.  Her work is better at describing antebellum reform than explaining  it.  Correctly acknowledging the importance of evangelical religion,  perfectionism, free will, and republicanism, Tyler overemphasizes the  importance of the frontier (clearly influenced by Turner's thesis) and  tends to promote the idea that antebellum reform was inevitable.  Yet even  though she fails to establish the underlying explanation for freedom's  ferment, Tyler does succeed in sheer descriptive merit.  Her work discusses  every conceivable reform and clearly reveals connections to European  reform.  Her bibliography is extensive and useful to researchers.  I  recommend this work to any student of antebellum reform; however, readers  looking for a shorter introduction to the topic may want to try Ronald  Walter's American Reformers.	1998-10-04

In this work, Griffin provides an excellent and brief summary of the major  issues debated by historians surrounding antebellum reform.  The first  third of the book is spent in an insightful discussion surrounding the  nature and definition of reform.  He explores some of the problems  encountered when historians portray reformers as the reformers portrayed  themselves.  Ultimately he suggests that reform be analyzed as a part of  human nature and not be limited to the study of particular groups.  The  middle third of this work discusses the varieties of reform.  Griffin  examines the methods and goals of the reformers.  While finding some common  ground in their ultimate goals, Griffin concludes that no single theme  emerges from the study of antebellum reform.  Variety and diversity are its  nature.  Griffin concludes his work by exploring the successes and failures  of reform.  Accusing historians of finding in antebellum reform what they  wanted to find, Griffin declares that true understanding of the reformers  will be gained only if we do not care how well the reformers served their  subjects and the nation.  While this work is now outdated, Griffin's  insights remain valuable.  His calls for more synthesis in this field have,  for the most part, gone unheeded.  In a field of with little  historiography, I recommend this book as an excellent introduction to the  historical scholarship (through 1967) of antebellum reform.	1998-09-06

This work explores the relationship between tobacco, debt, and revolution in the pre-revolutionary Chesapeake.  T.H. Breen's path to revolution flows from (1) trouble in the tobacco economy to (2) increasing planter debt to (3) a fear over lost autonomy to (4) a collective frustration to (5) a commitment to cultural renewal.  The collective frustration and commitment to renewal both coincided with the resistance to Britain over constitutional issues.  While not advocating any monocausal explanation, Breen does argue that the planter's fear over lost autonomy was necessary for the revolution.  My main criticism is that he assumes that the elites set the pattern for behavior in the Chesapeake and therefore does not adequately explain why the Chesapeake's non-elites supported the revolution.  This question regarding Virginia's non-elites seems particular important given Virginia's relative internal unity during the revolutionary period.  Overall, Breen's exploration of the cultural world of the Chesapeake elite does enhance our understanding of the path to revolution.  I recommend this work to any student of revolutionary America.	1998-03-22

Stanley Harrold's well-written work is an important contribution to antislavery historiography.  Taking to task those historians who see antislavery as primarily a movement to reform Northern society, Harrold demonstrates that Northern and Southern abolitionists were active in the South up until the Civil War.  Furthermore, Harrold makes a convincing case that the very real abolitionist presence in the Upper South was a &quot;precipitative cause of secession and the Civil War.&quot;  For Harrold, the Southern response to the abolitionist threat was neither irrational or exaggerated.  I commend Harrold's work to any student of antislavery or the antebellum South.	1997-12-01
