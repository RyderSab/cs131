Elizabeth was vulnerable , yet strong and Ramiel was very vulnerable and let it show. So much tension! What a shocking ending.  <br />Great piece , well written and I could not put it down! <br /> <br />Highly recommend!	2005-08-06
US	52690045	R2RQQ6YS322ED5	0553569910	991266491	The Ugly Duckling	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Loved it!	I recently discovered IJ and I have been reading everthing that she has written, I like her style. I loved this book because this was no size 2 model type woman, she was real, a little plump and dealing with many insecurities. He saw something in her anyway that he loved. IJ makes her men strong but yet vulerable to her strong but loving women, and it is refreshing to have men who wear their hearts on their sleeves sometimes. Alex from Reap the Wind is a perfect example(my all time fav). Nick and Nell are a good couple and this is a great read! Pick it up and try Reap the Wind and the continuation Final Target too, you will not regret it!	2004-04-09

The third in the four books about the Wind Dancer, Final Target is the last in the Wind Dancer series. <BR>I loved this book, the characters were great, the main ones Alex and Caitlin were fabulous together. I could not stand it if they were not on every page and when they were it was hot , hot and more hot. I could not put this book down! I loved the plot , the twists and the turns. Added to the list of my all time favs! Alex and Caitlin left me wishing for more and she did not give much about them in the Final Target, I am still thirsty! Fatal Tide another IJ book is the story of Melis the orphan that was rescued by Kemal and Caitlin in Reap the Wind. Kemal and Marisa(Chelsea Andreas daughter, Reap the Wind) also have a mention in Fatal Tide. I feel like I am a part of this journey with all of these characters. Keep them coiming IJ! <br />DGW	2004-04-02

Vegans should know that a chef touring the world looking for food from different places trees will not be the only items on his plate. This is not for the faint of heart(literally!). As someone who only eats fish, this book had me wincing and groaning many times! I have better understanding  of the hows and why people of other cultures eat the foods that they do. And Tony did try some vegetarian fare in California, so the book is balanced. <BR>A lively, well written, amusing read!	2003-08-18
