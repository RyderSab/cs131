Brodie Yates hoped to find those qualities as he returned to the town he also called home.

There's something so soothing about knitting - the sweet clicking of needles weaving yarn into items made with love. It's a very calming hobby and it's no wonder that the beloved craft has made a resurgence in popularity. So it makes perfect sense for best selling author Debbie Macomber to combine her love of knitting and writing as she takes her readers on a trip back to revisit the lovely little yarn shop on Blossom Street in her latest novel, \\"A Good Yarn.\\"<br /><br />Lydia Hoffman opened her shop, A Good Yarn, a year ago as a celebration in her life of overcoming cancer twice in her young life. The shop was met with great success, and Lydia had found contentment in her life as she taught her beloved knitting classes and renewed her friendship with her sister Margaret who came to work with her. She also found love with deliveryman Brad Goetz and they planned to be married one day soon.<br /><br />But life has a way of throwing monkey-wrenches into the best lives, and Lydia soon finds herself dealing with heartache as Brad announces that he is back on speaking terms with his ex-wife. As Lydia reels from this crisis-of-the-heart, her sister Margaret is also dealing with problems in her own homelife, and their mother is beginning to experience declining health problems that keep both sisters busy dealing with her care. But as always, her optimism for life, her love for and of family and friends, and her knitting carry Lydia through this rough bump in her life.<br /><br />Customers of Lydia's shop flock to her store to find the best yarns and advice on knitting, but they also find warmth and friendship among the threads.  In interweaving stories, three new ladies join Lydia's sock knitting class, and although they are all from diverse backgrounds and ages, they soon find a connection to each other as they click their needles away.<br /><br />Elise Beaumont has recently retired as a school librarian, but<br /><br />finds her dreams of owning her own home dashed as a con-artist makes off with her investment money. Forced to move in with her daughter, Elise is dismayed when it is announced that her ex-husband, a gambler who had been out of her life for many years, would be paying the family an extended visit. Would their former affection for each other resurface, or would old wounds still be tender? Elise finds an escape in her knitting and joins the sock class as a way of avoiding the tense situations at home.<br /><br />Bethanne Hamlin thought she had a perfect life - a wonderful husband, nice home, and great kids. Then her world was turned upside down when her husband leaves her for a younger woman, and the stay-at-home mom must learn to make ends meet.  As her daughter rebels and the financial situation declines, Bethanne splurges on a knitting class as a way of saving a little of her sanity. As she becomes acquainted with the class, she finds not only friendship but encouragement to pursue her dreams.<br /><br />It seemed unusual for a teenager to be enrolled in knitting classes, but Courtney Pulanski's grandmother thought it would be good for Courtney to try this new activity, in addition to the swimming classes with her senior citizens class. The young girl has come to live with her grandmother while her father is working out of the country, and is somewhat depressed and overweight. Courtney soon finds a sense of accomplishment in her knitting and is surprised to find that the swimming and a new hobby of bike-riding is actually helping her physical appearance as well. When she befriends Bethanne's daughter and son, life takes on a new dynamic that makes it more bearable than the teen could have imagined.<br /><br />The ladies from Macomber's book, \\"The Shop on Blossom Street,\\" make appearances at the shop, interacting with the new ladies and bringing a sense of continuity to the story that I personally hope will continue in future books.

For one girl, it would divide her family; for another, it would devastate her father; for the other, it would be the family's shining moment. Each girl has her own reasons for making the life-changing decision. One seeks to heal a broken heart, one feels a calling from God, and one just did what she knows her family wants her to do. The girls leave behind their families and all their worldly possession, and join into a new family and a new way of life when they enter a convent to become nuns.<br />In her new book, \\"Changing Habits,\\" best-selling author Debbie Macomber explores a world that fascinates many but has remained a mystery for ages; the world of the sisterhood of nuns.<br />Three young women join the sisterhood of St. Bridget's Sisters of the Assumption. Angelina had gone to Catholic schools all her life and had a special affinity for the nuns who taught her. She felt she had a calling from God, and despite her father's objections, entered the convent determined to return the gift of learning by becoming a parochial teacher. Kathleen had known she would become a nun since she was six years old because it was what her family expected of her. Joanne entered the convent broken-hearted and searching for peace after her fianc&eacute; returned from Vietnam married to another woman.<br />Each woman goes through the process from postulate to novice to sister, and each finds her vocation within the sisterhood.

Although secluded from most of the \\"real\\" world in their early years, as they mature and become more involved in their community each sister finds that events of the world soon affect their own lives, and eventually causes each to reconsider their place among the religious order.<br />Angelina loves her position as a teacher, but when she feels that she has failed a young pregnant teenager she finds herself longing to return home to help her father in the family restaurant.

After years of off-and-on detective work, an innocent sip of coffee from a paper cup provided the final damning details to identify the killer.<br />It was definitely Faryion Wardrip.<br />In her latest book,The Body Hunter, premiere Texas true-crime author Patricia Springer has taken the bits and pieces of a story that took years to develop and compiled them into a fascinating, cohesive tale of one man's lethal obsessions.<br />According to the book, Faryion Wardrip's road to Death Row can be summed up fairly simply: after his first wife left him and took the children, he spent the rest of his life as a free man striking back -- murdering her over and over again -- with innocent, unwilling stand-ins in the lead role.<br />Though the events surrounding Wardrip's unspeakable crimes and subsequent conviction were daily news fare, it is the unpublicized details of the case that Springer uses to flesh out the tale that makes The Body Hunter a thoroughly riveting read. Spending months gathering background research into each of the victims' lives, interviewing the families, and attending each day of Wardrip's trial provided Springer a unique outlook into both sides of the story. Not only does she acquaint you with each of the dead girls' individual life circumstances, she delves into the makeup of the mind of a murderer -- not to explain his actions, but to inform the reader of the events that lead up to his eventual descent into homicide as a self-justified form of emotional expression.<br />Springer also informs the reader as the legal process involved in cases such as Faryion Wardrip's: the long, drawn-out investigation, the intense search once the pieces of the puzzle began to fall in place, and the cooperation between legal agencies that worked together to try and convict a man who proved to be a ruthless serial killer.<br />The Body Hunter includes several pages of rather gruesome photographs of crime scenes that some might find offensive. Some are downright terrifying. But overall, this book is remarkable for its in-depth research and presentation of the facts of a case that was too close to home for too many.ges of rather gruesome photographs of crime scenes that some might find offensive.

Lately, I've become fascinated, if not quite addicted, to watching a late-night program called \\"Crossings with John Edward.\\" John Edward is a psychic medium who claims he communicates with people who have passed from this life, and from watching his show, I'd say his claims are pretty good - but that's another story. Edward has branched out into the literary world to bring his message of validation in this life in his new novel, \\"What If God Were The Sun?\\"<br />In his story, the central character is Timothy Callahan, a man who hails from a large Italian American family, a typical close-knit family that loves big gatherings. But above all else, the Callahans love one another. However tragedy has struck this boisterious family when Timothy's mother discovers she has cancer.<br />As the family struggles to deal with this new phase of their lives, Timothy begins to wonder what happens after someone dies, when they cross over to the afterlife. In one instance as the family watches old home movies, he wonders to himself, &quot;As I look over at my mom, I know that she's wondering if all these faces of yesteryear will be the faces of her tomorrows. Will she see them when she crosses over? Will her loved ones welcome her on the other side, as we all want to believe? I hope so.&quot;<br />As his mother's struggles with her battle with cancer progresses, Timothy remembers back to his childhood when his mother explained that God was the sun, an epiphany that becomes more tangible as he wrestles with impending death. As the story comes to it's emotional and dramatic end, is it the death of Timothy's mother we've been following or someone else's journey to the afterlife? Readers will be surprised.<br />\\"What If God Were The Sun?\\" will probably not win any big prizes for being great literature, and at some points it's hard to figure out just who the narrator is talking about, but it's overall message is relatively simple. Edward's main point is to pass along the message of letting the important people in your life know that you care for them in this lifetime. He offers a comforting message that love that can bridge even death.<br />In his work as a psychic medium, Edward helps survivors work through the overwhelming and sometimes unbearable grief of losing a loved one. I was personally touched by this sensitive story. Whether you believe in an afterlife or not, it's kind of nice to think that the ones we love might be watching out for us after they're gone.

But these days, southern women are a rich combination of both sets of characteristics, and excellent examples of this can be found in Lois Battle's new book, &quot;The Florabama Ladies Auxiliary and Sewing Circle.&quot;<br />Atlanta socialite Bonnie Duke Cullman has come to a life-altering crossroads in her life. Her husband has run out on her for a younger woman. To add insult to injury, he has also spent their life's savings and filed for bankruptcy. Accustomed since birth to a country club existence, she has never done a &quot;real&quot; day's work in her life. So, for the first time in her life, 50-year old Bonnie is facing life alone and financially strapped.<br />Hope for Bonnie comes in the form of a position at a tiny community college in Florabama, Alabama. The Cherished Lady lingerie factory is being closed down, and the college hires Bonnie to run its program for displaced homemakers and workers. In a blind-leading-the-blind proposition, Bonnie is supposed to help the women, many who had never known another job, figure out what to do with the rest of their lives. She starts out by gathering them into a weekly group session to help everyone air their opinions and concerns, and begins to learn just how hard &quot;real&quot; life is for these women.<br />Determined to help the ladies better their lives, Bonnie calls upon friends from her former life to help them set up a cottage industry using their skills as seamstresses to design a line of unique children's clothes. The project is a huge success, but teeters on the brink of disaster when one of their own runs off with their first big paycheck. But with resolve and resilience that surprises even the most skeptical in the group, the women regroup and come back to prove they are capable of overcoming the odds to be victorious.<br />Author Lois Battle has gathered a delightful group of women in this heartwarming tale.

There's patient, saintly Ruth, who has always wanted to be a teacher; the hot-tempered, slightly bigoted Hilly who finds the second love of her life in a Mexican restaurant; and Roxy, the irresponsible young mother who takes anything she can get, as long as it doesn't involve work.

In the first short story, &quot;Fine Print,&quot; author Liz Curtis Higgs introduces her readers to Meghan DeWitt, a public relations counselor who has been called in to help a prominent publisher gain confidence in his speaking abilities. When she meets the handsome Hugh Osborne, Meghan feels a tug at her heart, an emotion that she hasn't felt since her jerk of a former fianc&eacute; dumped her. However, it's going to take a lot to convince Meghan that the time is right to fall in love again. Luckily, for her and Hugh, there's a whole lot of matchmaking going on by Hugh's daughter and father. Hugh and Meghan don't have a choice but to fall head-over-heels for each other. This is a delightful story exploring God's mysterious ways in bringing two reluctant hearts together. Higgs, who is as well known for her humorous skits as an inspirational speaker as she is for writing (her other two Christian-based novels are &quot;Mixed Signals&quot; and &quot;Bookends&quot;), really strikes a chord with this heartwarming tale. In Carolyn Zane's short story, &quot;Sweet Chariot,&quot; the action follows the antics of Opal and Eunice, two little old ladies who purchase a motor home, sight unseen, then drag their adult grandchildren, Lexie and Jake, along for a cross-country trip. Readers will delight in the mischievous antics of the two matchmaking grannies, and the stunts they pull to bring the two helpless victims together. Zane, who is the author of over twenty novels, presents a tender tale filled with love and laughter. Karen Ball's tale, &quot;Bride On The Run,&quot; is the story of Alexandria Wingate, a lovely and very eligible young woman who defies her father's wish for her to marry a man she despises. When she manages to escape the nuptials with the assistance of her best friend and one-time nanny, Birdy, the fun is on. When their adventures take Alex right into the unknowing arms of Birdy's nephew Evan, well, let's just say the match made in heaven needed a little encouragement to get off the ground. Ball, who is the senior fiction editor for Multnomah Publishers, produces a whimsical, sentimental story that will touch the soul. Each of these short stories offer warm Christian messages revolving around characters learning to trust God. Although some of the plots are a little predictable, the characters in each story have been carefully developed - the women are feisty, the men are believably sensitive, and all are even a touch confused about what they want out of life. This lively faith-filled collection would be a wonderful gift for anyone who loves the Lord and enjoys a good romance.th the assistance of her best friend and one-time nanny, Birdy, the fun is on.

In 1961, when a wild young man named Jack Reeves began to court the innocent and pretty Sharon Vaughn at the Northside Baptist Church, folks knew even then nothing good would come of the relationship. Jack was too  mean, too possessive, and too prone to rage, but that was what excited the  shy, naïve young girl. To most who knew them, it came as a surprise when  Sharon allegedly committed suicide with a shotgun blast to the chest after  the marriage had evidently gone bad. It was an even bigger surprise when,  35 years later, Reeves was charged with Sharon's murder. But Sharon wasn't  the only wife Jack Reeves was charged with murdering. Evidence would soon  come to light that he'd allegedly not murdered one, but three of his four  wives. And he nearly got away with all three killings. Just what kind of  man was this Jack Reeves? True-crime writer Patricia Springer addresses  this question in her exciting true-crime release, \\"Mail Order Murder.\\"<br />In 1994, Jack Reeve's fourth wife, Emelita, a young Filipino mail-order  bride, was reported missing by her friends. When police arrived at the  Reeve's Arlington home, they found a surly husband who showed little  concern for his young wife's whereabouts. He claimed she'd run away to be  with her friends, and that he didn't care if she ever came back or not. So  they did what he wouldn't . . . began an all-out search for her. While  investigating Emelita Reeve's disappearance, police detectives made some  grisly discoveries about Jack Reeve's other wives (his first marriage was  annulled when it was discovered his bride was underaged). In 1978, Sharon  Vaughn Reeves had died from an apparent suicide. Eight years later Reeve's  third wife, Korean-born Myong Hui, drowned in a mere three feet of water.  With such a mysterious family history, police soon begin to suspect that  wife #4, Emelita, had not merely run away. Had she been murdered by her  husband?<br />Author Pat Springer takes her readers on a thrilling, often  grisly journey to discover just what kind of \\"killing machine\\" Jack Reeves  was and just why he killed his wives. Beginning with the very day of  Emelita Reeve's reported disappareance, through the discovery of the other  wives' tragic deaths, to Reeve's trials for the murders of Sharon Reeves  and Emelita, Springer has diligently documented the detailed police  investigations and subsequent convictions. Included in among the facts are  interviews with the families and friends of both Sharon Reeves and Emelita.<br />However, \\"Mail Order Murder\\" is not merely dry, factual reading. A  witness to many of the events surrounding the investigation and trials,  Springer's lively first-hand account keeps readers on the edge; they often  feel like they are working alongside the detectives in trying to solve the  case. Through the heroic efforts of police investigators and the criminal  justice system, Jack Reeves was convicted of murdering Sharon Vaughn Reeves  and Emelita Villa Reeves. The third mysterious death, that of Myong Hui  Reeves, was never proven as he had her body cremated before suspicions  arose. At 58 years old, Reeves is currently serving a 99-year prison  sentence, and is not eligible for parole until 2045.<br />Author Patricia  Springer, known as the Texas version of Ann Rule, is widely respected for  her accurate documentation of real crime stories.

You catch glimpses of them out the corner of your eye; those quick little shadows that just weren't there before you brought home that fine old antique you picked up so cheaply at that sad little shop. There it is again! You're sure you saw it that time! What's going on here? Could it be  that that bargain antique is somehow . . . naaaw! But, according to  author/antique dealer Ed Okonowicz in &quot;Possessed Possessions&quot; and  &quot;Possessed Possessions 2,&quot; those cut-rate antiques might very  well be haunted indeed. And it's not just antiques. Any object that was  important to or cherished by someone in life, he suggests, can be watched  over by that someone's . . . ghost? . . . later on.<br />With a generous 20  chilling stories per volume, &quot;Possessed Possessions&quot; and  &quot;Possessed Possessions 2&quot; chronicles the tribulations of ordinary  people who liked antiques until they brought home THE piece. Dolls with  utterly lifelike eyes, well-used mirrors (maybe too well-used?), chairs  that can't be content sitting in rooms alone, record players that just  can't seem to shake the habit, and over three dozen more of the most  dissatisfied objects ever to cause a domestic uproar will have you thinking  twice about that incredibly inexpensive and thoroughly collectible  must-have.<br />But Orkonowicz never claims the stories he has collected in  his &quot;Possessed Possessions&quot; series are in any way answers to the  great question of whether or not ghosts really exist or not, and he never  makes a statement of personal belief one way or the other. In fact, he  insists in his introduction, the spine-chilling tales present many more  questions than answers, and he never actively seeks out the mysterious  stories.<br />Are the too-lifelike eyes in that exquisite old flea  market-acquired portrait really looking at you? If even a fraction of the  troubled collectibles enthusiasts Okonowicz has attracted over the years  are to be believed, those eyes might indeed be watching.<br />-Sharon  Galligar Chanceose eyes might indeed be watching. <br />-Sharon  Galligar Chance	2000-04-27

As the local pharmacist, Ave's been keeping the townsfolk's  secrets for years, but she's about to discover a skeleton in her own  family's closet that will blow the lid right off her uneventful life.  After the death of her mother, Ave Maria kept herself busy with the  pharmacy, volunteer work, and as director of the town's long-running  outdoor drama. She's content with her life when, suddenly, she discovers  that the man she called Daddy was not her real father, and her life might  not be all she always thought it was.  While trying to come to grips with  this new self-realization, Ave finds herself juggling two marriage  proposals, conducting a vicious family feud with her feisty aunt, and  planning a life-changing journey to Italy to locate her real father.

In keeping with the recent popularity of novels set in the Italian region of Tuscany, a new literary contender, \\"Renato's Luck\\" by Jeff Shapiro, enters the arena to delight and fascinate readers.<br />In the small Tuscan  village of Sant'Angelo D'Asso, the waterworks man, Renato Tizzoni, comes  face to face with a bona-fide dose of mid-life crisis: he has lost his  taste for life. His surrogate father and mentor has just died, and his  teenaged daughter is wrapped up in her boyfriend. And, although he still  loves and cherishes his wife, even his 20-year old marriage seems to have  lost its luster. Worst of all, the town where he has lived all his days is  slated to become a reservoir when the nearby river is dammed up to follow a  government plan for irrigating local soil.<br />Renato longs deeply for  renewal and, despite the fact that he is not a religious man, interprets a  series of strange dreams featuring a floating hand that points him to  treasure as a call to change his luck. Renato decides that he must travel  to Rome, to the Vatican City, to shake hands with the pope while touching  his behind with his other hand, thereby initiating a chain reaction leading  to a stroke of luck, or &quot;stroke of ass&quot; (&quot;colpo di  culo&quot; in Italian slang). Eventually, as word of his intentions gets  out, almost the entire village becomes invested in the outcome of his  trip.<br />As he readies himself for this life-altering journey, Renato  collects the villagers' words of wisdom on a slip of paper that he carries  in his back pocket and intends to present to the pope. As the story moves  leisurely toward an anticipated resolution, Renato realizes that many of  the people he knows and loves need a change of luck as much as he  does.<br />\\"Renato's Luck\\" by Jeff Shapiro is a sweet and engaging tale,  without being shallow in the least. Shapiro, a longtime American resident  of Tuscany, is writing in English in his debut novel, but his phrasing and  inflection that give the narrative and dialogue a flavor that is  distinctly, and charmingly, Italian.

Not to  give away the ending, but after 10 days of knowing each other, Miranda and  Li struggle with the implausible -- one page has her staying in China (what  about her kids in the US?) and the next page has him leaving China and  moving to the US. Make up your minds! Unfortunately this is not one of the  authors' best works, but it is entertaining if you are interested in  Chinese culture and people.<br />  -Sharon Galligar Chance	2000-04-26

It's easy to miss the epiphany of this tale, if there is one at all, but you have to begrudgingly admire Brookner's courage in bringing solitude to the surface, with all its pain and terrors. Desperate, lonely thoughts make  up this entire story, leaving room for insights so sharp their cuts are  barely felt. However, by whittling an existence from indifferent fate,  Brookner's characters are so lackluster that you almost feel yourself  cheering on their defeat. Normally, if I don't like a book I simply don't  review it. But I wanted to like \\"Undue Influence.\\" After all, Brookner has  long been heralded as \\". . . one of the finest novelists of her generation\\"  by the New York Times, and they should know what they are talking about.  Right?  But no matter how hard I tried, I just didn't like Claire, and I  thought her problems were self-made and silly. I kept waiting for the story  to get better, and it never did. It was depressing to the end.  My  recommendation is to skip this one.<br />-Sharon Galligar Chance	2000-04-26

It's hard for the average, normal mind to fathom the killing of another human being in the name of jealously. But that was the unimaginable motive behind the murder of 19 year-old Colleen Slemmer. The murderer? An equally young 18-year old Christa Pike. In her latest true-crime thriller, &quot;A  Love To Die For,&quot; Dallas author Patricia Springer brings to light the  chilling story of Christa Pike, the youngest woman ever sentenced to death  row. Using actual court transcriptions, confessions from the parties  involved and interviews with the victim's parents, prosecutors, and others  involved in the grusome case, Springer weaves a fascinating tale of the  twisted, fantasic life of a very distrubed young woman, and the incredibly  hideous crime she committed. In January, 1995 in Knoxville, Tennessee,  young Job Corps student Colleen Slemmer went for a walk in the woods  surrounding the University of Tennessee campus with fellow student and  sometime-friend Christa Pike. Suddenly, Christa turned on Colleen, accusing  her of flirting with her boyfriend. The words soon turned to shocking  physical blows. Not satisfied with the damage mere fist could cause,  Christa then used a box knife to cut her rival's throat, and a miniature  meat cleaver to inflict even more horror. Half-naked, the mangled Colleen  crawled through pools of her own blood, pleading for her life, to no avail.  Rage had filled Christa's already unstable mind, her instability evidenced  by the satanic symbol carved on the dying girl's chest during the hour-long  assault. When Christa was finally done, and Colleen lay dead, Christa took  a piece of her victim's skull as a macabre souvenir of a crime she would  later brag about to friends. In this stunning recreation of a case that  shocked a nation, Patricia Springer takes her readers beyond just a mere  description of a horrible crime and the trial which followed. She takes her  readers into the very mind-set of  the young murdereress, and attempts to  show how Christa Pike's rash actions have brought her to the place where  she'll have to pay the ultimate price for the crime of taking someone's  life - her very own life in exchange. &quot;A Love To Die For&quot; is  something of a depature in scenery for Springer's writing, as she has  before only written about Texas-based murder cases, including Ricky Green,  Darlie Routier, and Jack Reeves. But she brings to this story her  investigative expertise, her compassion for the victim's family and her  talent for storytelling to present a fascinating, if not gruesome at times,  story of a love gone terribly bad. Springer is currently at work on a book  detailing the crimes and trails of Olney, Texas native Fayrion Waldrip,  which is expected out in the near future.to  show how Christa Pike's rash actions have brought her to the place where  she'll have to pay the ultimate price for the crime of taking someone's  life - her very own life in exchange. &quot;A Love To Die For&quot; is  something of a depature in scenery for Springer's writing, as she has  before only written about Texas-based murder cases, including Ricky Green,  Darlie Routier, and Jack Reeves.

Phillip's expereince in television (his many credits include creating &quot;Suddenly Susan&quot; for NBC) obviously shines through the work, and could signal a long-term trend in how books, novels in particular, are crafted for today's busy, easily distracted, reading public.<br /> I'll admit it right up front, sometimes I skip to the end just to find out if the book is worth my time getting there.  Big mistake with FALL FROM GRACE. This story has so many twists and turns, that even skipping to the end will not prepare you for the blockbuster finish.
