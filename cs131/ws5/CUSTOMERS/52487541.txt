She sketches out the historical manners and seeting beautifully. Then she combines it with the very real life of a policeman. A man who has survived a dreadfully violent past to build a career, a career that seeks to save others from violence, and punish those that threaten it. His daily life is interrupted by shadows of the past he has worked so hard to put behind him. He must deal with both his sister's untimely death, and the reappearance of his violent father. The question is not simply will he save the father he hates but should he? An evcellent addition to the series, I recommend it highly.	2005-08-21

It is a nice prequel with the exception of the addition of Dawn. Dawn muddies the mythology and the back story. However in this case it doesn't matter. The artwork is extraordinary. It should be framed. The demons are very creative. The stills take my breath away. Angel in his birthday suit doesn't hurt the eyes either. I love the use of poetry with the artwork. The monsters are real in the sense that we all have encountered them. The artists have given them form and personality. Perhaps they are easier to fight that way. Bravo!!!	2004-05-04

Action packed this book brings each of the complex plots to an agreeable end. Everyone plays apart as the gang tries to defeat the monsters, find the missing children, and stop the gang warfare. It is the action rather than the relationships, which sparkle in this story. The battles are well written. Poodle size rats, disembodied armor, slavers, mad zoo keepers, shadows, giant worms and miscellaneous monsters threaten the gang.<br />Because there are so many characters it is hard to give them equal time or explore their emotions as much as fully as the reader might like. Not only do we have Buffy, Angel and their gangs, but even Faith and the mayor make an appearance. The authors for the most part have done an excellent job of working in the series history and keeping the characters true to their TV personalities. There are some lovely inside jokes that true Buffy fans will love. There are, however, some inconsistencies. When Faith is added to the team she pitches in to help Angel but says she owes Buffy nothing. Yet the last we saw Faith on the TV series she was acknowledging that Buffy was the only one who gave her chance after chance and that she had not only rejected her friendship but had attacked her friends and messed with her life. So it was hard to understand her anger at Buffy.<br /> The back drop of the other realities was very intriguing. I loved the vampire zoo especially and the worm tunnels made my skin crawl. A nice touch was the temptations. Although I think that Angel's temptation would have been more realistic if it had not excluded Buffy.<br />I enjoyed the trilogy and this book in particular. I recommend it highly to Buffy fans but I would not suggest reading it without reading the other two Unseen volumes first.	2001-09-01

This, the second book in the Lindy Haggerty Mystery series, certainly does not disappoint. Ms Freydont's characters are three dimensional and colorfully drawn. Here she combines, classical dancers, opera singers, cabaret performers and a rock star to achieve a fascinating group of victims and suspects. The plot has many twists and turns. The cruise ship is surrounded by a school of red herring. She mixes information about the art form skillfully with murder and soap opera. I highly recommend this book to mystery and theater lovers alike.	2001-08-25

Lady Elizabeth is again up to her neck in murder. To make matters worst she tries to bring peace between the Yanks and the British troops. The Manor is now occupied by American officers one of whom has stolen her heart. But alas Lady Elizabeth's major has a wife at home, a fact she forces herself to remember every time she is faced with his disarming blue eyes. The plot is filled with pathos and humor. A mentally challenged young man grieves the loss of a friend. When a German parachutes into town square the housewives moblize, armed with carving knives, to save Sitting Marsh from invasion. The characters are charming and real. The puzzle makes for a good plot and she even throws in a ghost. I loved this book and can barely wait for number three. I highly recommend it.	2001-08-25

With this book she has introduced a charming new set of characters, the confused butler, the feisty house maid, the unfortunate cook and the handsome major. The village of Sitting Marsh is a contrast of old English customs and the modern World War Two culture. Lady Elizabeth is an independent woman who is determined to care faithfully for her village and its inhabitants. She takes her duty as Lady of the Manor very seriously. She starts out to find a missing girl and ends up solving a murder. I found myself caught up in the personalities, the war effort and the noisy plumbing. The murder almost becomes a subplot. An excellent beginning I recommend it to Pennyfoot fans as well as WWII buffs.	2001-08-25

Set in the Twentieth Century, Dru and Spike love, fight and love again. That is when they are not feeding on the unsuspecting. The writing is excellent. The themes are fresh and new. The dialogue is crisp. I enjoyed the action sequences. The artwork is dark and interesting. The characters are well drawn with great detail. It is impossible to miss Spike wonderful cheek bones.

Fast paced and funny, the author balances the hopelessness of Didi's grief and guilt that she knew so little about her 'best' friend and the comic relief of Charlie's big plans. The plot they uncover is complex and nasty and poor Rose is not all she seemed to be. <br />This is one of the best puzzles of the series. I could not put it down and read it all in one sitting. If indeed this is the last  of the Dr. Nightingale series I am sorry to see them go. I have developed a great love for the good doctor and her elves. I recommend this and the other 11 books in this series to anyone who loves mysteries and animals.	2001-08-05

Angel: Bruja is an excellent addition to the Angel series. The plot is complex. A gang of vampires is running a 'Meals on Wheels' operation. Stolen game software leads Angel and Doyle to an underground dot.com company complete with demon telemarketers. Cordelia tracks a missing wife. Doyle has a brain draining vision of a young mother in trouble. Kate is searching for a weeping woman in black who is killing cops and children. Mr. Odom weaves them all together into an excellent story, which explores guilt and insecurities. Angel is reminded that while you cannot forget your past you should not live in it. It is not only the lesson he must learn but also teach another if he is to succeed. The book also has a strong sense of family.<br />I recommend this to all fans of the series as well as readers who enjoy good horror fantasy	2001-08-04

This book is a collection of the original shooting scripts for the first 6 episodes of season two. Included are When She Was Bad, Some Assembly Required, School Hard, Inca Mummy Girl, Reptile Boy and Halloween.

I found this to be another excellent addition to the Father Koesler series. The Detroit now-retired parish priest solves the crime once more calling on his knowledge of church politics and scripture. The plot deals with a famous and popular Anglican priest, who decides to sacrifice it all and be a Catholic priest. His reason for doing so remains a mystery to the end. Neither a Catholic nor Anglican I found the narrative fascinating. The murder almost becomes a backdrop to the hate surrounding this sacrifice and a black priest. The author presents us with several red herrings to this complex puzzle. I can honestly say I believe that The Sacrifice has breathed new life into the series. I recommend this book to both fans of the series as well as readers, who enjoy a good intellectual story	2001-07-22

Earthly Possessions presents an excellent group of demons, which are drawn with great imagination. Angel, Cordelia and Doyle come to the aid of a woman whose husband is possessed. This brings Angel in contact with Father Noe a traveling exorcist. Soon the two are working together. But Angel wonders if the former priest is too familiar with these demons. Is the good father a hero or a demonic con man? The action is colorfully drawn. I recommend this book to graphic novel and Angel fans	2001-07-18

A plot so complex and characters so rich they deserve 300 pages. Christopher Golden never disappoints. <br />The art work  is exciting and colorful. I think the actors are well drawn. Their voices are true. <br />Set in the fourth season, Buffy is at college. The pressures weigh heavy on her slayer duties.

This glimpse into his wife's past fills Monk with admiration and a greater understanding of Hester's past. <br />All the characters have a noble obsession, which contributes to their downfall.

Picking up the story of gang war fare, corrupt cops, new monsters and disappearing teens; this book enlarges on each plot line. As Buffy and Angel learn the source of each problem they are drawn deeper into danger and closer together. Angel admits to himself that he and Buffy share the same soul, the same heart. Buffy struggles with her relationship to Riley now that Angel is back in her life. The Sunnydale gang finds it difficult to accept a new and improved Cordelia. <br />The pages crackle with action, gang fights and monster attacks. Everyone gets a chance to jump into the fray.<br />Tara's concern for Willow adds a nice layer of romance. The authors use Anya to provide the comic relief.<br />I recommend this book to all Buffy and Angel fans. I can't wait for number three.	2001-07-14

The Lord of the Silent, the latest in the Amelia Peabody series, marks a return to the action and romance of the original stories. Adventure is laced with humor. The newlyweds provide the romance. Amelia and Emerson track criminals. The humor grows out of the three generations attempting to understand each other.  The plot is complex. Old enemies resurface. Tombs are robbed. Spies unmasked. Family members abducted. Treasure discovered. Nail biting escapes carried off just in the nick of time.  I was hooked from the first page. I think it is one of the best of the series.

A Conventional Corpse is an excellent addition to the series. The backdrop of a convention attended a group of eccentric authors is perfect for murder. The characters are delightful and well written. The teenagers add spice. The frightfully spoiled cat was a hoot. <br />Joan Hess always entertains but I think her plot twists in this book were especially clever. Also her character's anger toward her on again off again boyfriend rang true. Although as an incurable romantic I wanted to see them get together. In fact it is my hope that one book will contain a wedding and another perhaps a honeymoon with murder of course.<br />I recommend this book to all the Claire Malloy fans.	2001-07-14

I love mysteries so I was disappointed when in the first chapter I learned the identity of the murderer. But the characters are so well crafted that I was hooked. The setting on the sunshine coast of Canada is unique. The plot is not so much of a 'who done it' but rather a 'why'. The motive is doled out a crumb at a time.

But I was terribly disappointed. The plot was less than creative. The amount of material provided on the medical profession slowed it to a snail's pace. The sub plot, which dealt with two handsome brothers was far more interesting but under developed.

Nancy Holder and Jeff Mariotte have created interesting plots for both Buffy and Angel to pursue. Buffy is trying to help Willow's friend while Angel is responding to a summons by the powers that be. When all story lines lead to LA and the same informant, Angel and Buffy collide literally. The novel is set at the end of Buffy's fourth television season and the first season of Angel. The authors are careful to keep the relationships and conflicts intact. They include enough background so anyone could enjoy the book but not too much to bore a TV fan. The cliffhanger ending is frustrating but ripe with promise.  Riley, Angel and Buffy forced to work together. Missing girls, gangs, shadow monsters and witchcraft all combine to convince the reader to preorder the next volume. I recommend the series highly	2001-05-12

A beautiful soul of an innocent child is used to pay off a gambling debt. Doyle's vision brings Angel to the rescue. But the path is difficult, Angel is troubled by memories of his sister, the sister who loved him, the sister who thought him an angel right before he took her life. Angel is driven to succeed to find redemption in the act of restoring the child's soul.  The author has woven humor and action into a lovely story of dark magic and innocence. You will never look at a garden troll the same way again.  Set in the early part of the first season it is refreshing to see Doyle moon over Cordelia again. Harry, Doyle's former wife makes an appearance. I recommend this book to readers who enjoy Angel, the Television Series as well as newcomers who like horror fiction.	2001-05-08

Laurell K Hamilton creates a wonderful new character. Anita Blake is tough as nails and as moral as a nun. She makes raising the dead as ordinary as selling insurance. While introducing this new character the author is very wise. She does not tell us everything about Anita and her friends. So at the end of the story the reader wants more. I know I was. The story of a serial killer of vampires is refreshing. The action is non-stop. The romance is delightful. Even Anita's friends are dangerous, so you are never sure whom she should trust. I recommend this book to all horror and alternate history fans.	2001-04-18

As always Nancy Holder delivers an action packed story. The Book of Fours is a complex tale of slayers past and present. A great evil the Gatherer sends out his wanderers of fire, water, air and earth to kill the slayers. His victory will end the line of slayers forever. <br />There are many elements to recommend this book to readers. The plot is interesting. Set in the time frame of the third season, Angel and Buffy are still together. Ms Holder has provided the tortured couple some lovely moments. Buffy and Faith take on some unique monsters as the story begins. The description of this particular battle is not to be read on a full stomach. It is both exciting and terribly humorous. The author also details the evil as it grows from nothingness to a great power with the help of a flea and a sparrow. It is almost poetic. The final battle is vivid. The action is heart stopping.<br />I can't give this novel five stars because for everything I enjoyed about it I found that it had too many characters, too many subplots, and too many flash backs. This is the first book of the Buffy the Vampire Series that I can only recommend to fans who have seen the television series or who have read the excellent Gatekeeper's Trilogy co-authored by the same author. Someone new to the tale of the chosen one, the mythology of the slayer would be confused or not understand the full impact of the plot.	2001-04-08

The character is introduced in Faith, Hope and Trick. She is a sexy, sassy slayer on the run. She is a person who has always lived on the edge. She loves slaying and the power that comes with the slayer strength. In Bad Girls Faith introduces Buffy to the &quot;See, Want, Take&quot; principle. Their reckless behavior results in the death of a human. Faith's solution is to blame Buffy in Consequences. When the plan backfires the council steps in and drives Faith to the dark side. Faith, working for the mayor, tries to steal Angel's soul by giving him that one moment of happiness in Enemies. <br />James Laurence weaves a nice back-story to tie the four episodes together.

Nancy Atherton has woven a perfect gothic plot. All the elements are present: forbidden stirrings, revenge, lost loves, war, death, mysterious stranger, a bad marriage, a fainting virgin and things that go bump in the night. The author leaves nothing out. I was hooked from the first few pages and couldn't put it down. As Lori falls under the thrall of the spirits of the house and the seduction of the mysterious stranger I found myself shouting, &quot;Listen to your aunt! Don't do this!&quot; I was completely involved in the tale. This plot is more action filled than some of her earlier Dimity novels.

Perhaps because I am the keeper of several cats I enjoy this feline series. But for whatever reason I loved this entry from the ever-busy Lydia Adamson. <br />A Cat with the Blues gives the reader a good mystery with many twists and turns. In addition we see Alice in love, silly schoolgirl love. It is a fresh addition to the world wise former actress who has seen it all and has a plan to handle anything.<br />The old song 'Blue on blue, heart ache on head ache' would provide good background music to read this story of a Russian Blue caught in a messy divorce.

This book is a celebration of personalities and old wives tales. The mystery is almost secondary to the colorful characters that populate Moose County. I loved the 'waiting' for the big one, the snowstorm that will usher in winter with a bang. It was almost like waiting for Godot. In an odd way I felt worse about the destruction of a bookstore than I did about the murder victims. While I do not think this is the best in the series, I did enjoy it. But as some on the other reviews on this page have suggested I would not recommend it to a reader new to the series. I would suggest they start with an earlier book. But for fans like me who have read them all this is a must read book.	2001-03-18

Instead of O is for Outlaw it might be best titled O is for Obligation. It Kinsey's obligation to her former husband that drives the plot of this book. Mickey Magruder was a cop who was a bit of a lone wolf. He is the outlaw in the title. Now he is in trouble and Kinsey is driven to help him. It seems she may have left him for all the wrong reasons. His problems lead Kinsey to solve an old murder for which Mickey was the prime suspect. <br />This is one of Sue Grafton's best. It fills in the gaps in Kinsey's early professional life.

Unlike most gothic romances this book wasted no time in bring the man and woman together. The attraction is animal not romantic. The attraction is also deadly because once our hero has the heroine's heart he intends to eat it. <br />The tension builds, as the lady of the manor must find a way to lift the curse or be destroyed by her lover. Since wolves mate for life our lady considers giving herself to the beast and becoming his mate. The author explores how far one might go to be with the man she loves. <br />I enjoyed the twists and turns of this story. It was a departure from the standard gothic novel. The only thing, which kept this from being an excellent story was the author's choice of names for her female investigator, Holmes. The character also uses the famous detective's methods. It was an unnecessary distraction in an otherwise interesting plot.<br />I recommend this to fantasy/romance fans.	2001-03-18

When Ann Darling meets the father that abandoned her and her mother, she refuses to have anything to do with him. But once he is accused of murder she must decide if she can leave the past behind and help him. Meanwhile Max's mother has finally gone around the bend. She is having conversations with the dead in an effort to reach one of her dead husbands. Add to this confusion, a house designed by a mad movie director,a family right out of central casting, and a murder or two and you have a perfect holiday treat. Max as always does the research and sets the trap.<br /> The book is filled with wonderful references to Christmas mysteries as always I have added more titles to my reading list, a bonus that Carolyn Hart provides in each book.<br />As a cat owner I loved the trials and tribulations of hanging Christmas decoration with feline help. <br />I recommend this addition to the series to all Death on Demand fans and new comers as well.	2001-03-18

Gingerbread is a chilling tale of fear and prejudice. A Hansel and Gretel demon breeds terror and hate in Sunnydale. Parents turn against their children. Witches are once again threatened with burning and Buffy finds herself tied to a stake. In the second Doppelgangland, Anya tricks Willow into doing a spell to restore her necklace and her demon powers. The spell backfires and Willow opens a door to a world where she is a vampire. The vamp Willow is trapped in the real Sunnydale. Willow must deal with her evil self. The final story is Choices. While Willow is a central character in this plot it is actually part of a larger story arch for Buffy and Angel as well as Faith. For this reason I am not sure this story stands on its own. My one concern is that perhaps another teleplay should have been chosen to complete the trilogy. The entire gang is makes choices for their post high school lives. Willow is captured by Faith and the Mayor. <br />The journal entries try to tie the stories together but they are ramblings not as tight as the normal bindings found in these novelizations. I have given it four stars instead of five for that reason.<br />I did enjoy the book. I would recommend this book to people who have not seen the episodes or for fans of the Willow character.	2001-03-07
US	52487541	R2YZLHJASRPH0F	0743406982	571814612	Avatar (ANGEL)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Chat room chills	Who is your ideal dream date? Imagine a demon who can deliver the perfect man or woman. That's exactly what author John Passarella has done. The one catch is that with one kiss your perfect date will vacuum you clean until there is nothing left but a lifeless skin. Using the internet a demon selects his victims from chatrooms in order to complete a ritual. A cult tracks the demon in order to bend it to their will. Kate assumes the cult is respondsible for the killings. The Powers That Be send Angel and his crew to stop the demon and the cult. The demon presents himself to Angel as the one person in all the world Angel wants and can't have. <br />While the mythology is a bit hard to follow at times, the action is non-stop. The characters are written true to their television voices. I recommend this book to Angel fans.	2001-03-04

Her devil duke is as brooding as Heathcliff and as passionate as Mr Rochester. Misty moors and dangerous secrets weave an excellent back drop for the love story of a reluctant American heiress. I enjoyed the fact that the author wastes no time in bringing the lovers together. Neither denied their passions only events outside their control built barriers to keep them apart. While the duke's secret was easy to guess I found the knowledge enhanced the suspence. The reader who guesses will be left wondering who is who and when making the most passionate love scene a possible disaster. I highly recommend this book to all gothic fans.	2001-03-03

A strong story line holds the reader's interest. Angel's battles with demons and zombies are beautiful. They ripple with action. The addition of flash backs to Angel past add to the enjoyment. As usual the Christopher Golden dialogue is excellent. It rings true to each character. If I have any complaint it's that Kate does not resemble her TV counter part. But she plays such a minor role that it is not bothersome. I recommend this book to graphic novel and Angel fans	2001-02-14

The mythology and culture are presented with respect. The characters are well defined. It is enjoyable to see Xander in a major role and in love. Set in the third season Buffy and Angel are together again. More violent than many of the other books, the author writes action with amazing detail. The reader can easily visualize every kick, every punch. The racial tension adds a layer of realism. All in all well worth adding to your library.	2001-01-20

Although set in the first half of the first season it has all the feel of the Hollywood in 1961. The reader can imagine that they are watching an episode of Mannix or 77 Sunset Strip. Angel's new client is buried in a local cemetery. A long dead PI is hot on the heels of his killer. Kate is looking for a cop killer and Angel lands in jail. It is a well written detective story heavy with atmosphere. The only objection I have with this novel is that I would have liked to have more Angel. He often takes a back seat to the dead PI. Fans of hard boiled detective stories will enjoy this book as much as Buffy fans.	2001-01-20

Joyce asks Buffy and her friends to help staff the Sunnydale Art Fair. But when a stranger comes to town that even vampires fear, the fair takes a back seat to Buffy's need to save her friends and the universe from the evil visitor. The action is very visual. I can see the gang, Willow, OZ, Anya, and Xander as lifeless zombies and the small meaningful glances between Angel and Buffy.  The time line of the story is set in Buffy's senior year so Angel and Cordelia are still part of the mix. The colorful plot really engaged me. I found that I got out my Tarot deck and turned the cards with the artist as she read the cards for each character. I highly recommend this book.	2000-12-03

As volume one covered the first two seasons, The Watcher's Guide, Volume Two by Nancy Holder with Jeff Mariotte and Maryelizabeth Hart chronicles the next two seasons. In addition to the episode guide, character and cast profiles, the book explores the Buffyverse, the wonderful world of Buffy from creation to production. It has many features including quote of the week and scenes that were cut from the original scripts. Of course the romances are detailed with all their tragic passions.  The pictures are wonderful. I also enjoyed the sections on the bands and merchandise. This book is a must for all Buffy fans.	2000-11-08

They are under attack by strange earth demons that can destroy the world by causing massive earthquakes. As Angel accepts the case he is haunted by memories of a past quake and Angelus. Doyle does not trust the snake demons and sets out to find out everything he can about them before they draw Cordelia into their wealthy life style.<br />The mythology is new and interesting. It held my interest. The author was very clever tying all the plots together in the end. I was completely taken by the flash back. Angelus has never been so cruel. His torture of a young earth quake victim is so horrible that it makes anything previously attributed to him pale in comparison. The author also provides Angel fans the moment they have always wanted to see Angel vs Angelus in a show down. And to this mix Mr DeBrandt has added the evil law firm, Wolfgram and Hart, just for seasoning. <br />If I have one criticism  it is that Angel's voice doesn't sound true to his television character. However the author does such a fine job with Cordelia, Doyle and Angelus that it did not deter my enjoyment. I recommend this book for fans and readers new to the Angel series	2000-11-06

Angel is Angelus. Buffy and he are on opposite sides. A terrible demon, Dru's new boy toy, is about to bring about the apocalypse in Sunnydale. The plot is well constructed. Giles' temptation to bring back Jenny from the grave is very touching. The artwork has a dark elegance. I enjoyed the action drawings. A great deal of care was taken with the characters. I enjoyed this book. I found I read it quickly for the plot and then had to go back and savor the artwork frame by frame. I recommend this to graphic novel fans.	2000-10-13

Lindy Haggerty is suffering from an empty nest when an offer to get back into show business arrives in the form of her old friend. She joins the dance company only to find a Diva from hell causing trouble for everyone. I liked the light touch of romance. The clues and red herrings were spread about in a minefield of misdirection. If I had one complaint it is that Ms Freydont took so long to kill the victim. I was so annoyed by the character I was ready to do it myself. This book is a great read.	2000-10-10

Christopher Golden has done the impossible. He has taken the nasty, big bad villain from the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer and made him the anti-hero of an excellent novel. William the Bloody, known as Spike to his friends for the vile habit of torturing his victims with railroad spikes,wants nothing more than to please his demon lover,Dru. Together, they set off on a quest. They must simply kill all the 'slayers in waiting' young girls who are being trained because one day they might be called to be the Chosen One,the one girl in all the world born with the powers to fight the vampires. If Spike can accomplish this task, Dru will have a necklace which will allow her to see her reflection, a sight she has not seen for 80 years. It is 1940. The world is at war, as the pair travel from country to country leaving a trail of bodies in their wake. Taking pleasure in the bloody battle and each other, their journey becomes an erotic second honeymoon. When the council becomes aware of the plan they send the current slayer to hunt the hunters. The final duel is fascinating and deadly. Mr Golden combines, history, romance and horror to create this wickedly wonderful novel. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys good horror fiction even if they have never seen one episode of the TV show. For fans it fills in the back story on two of the series' favorite characters. Don't miss this book.	2000-10-09

The peril is real. The danger is heart stopping. As always in the midst of this whirlwind Mr.Golden and Ms. Holder take time to give the reader wonderful moments. For example the gatekeeper granting Angel a magic dream of Buffy so real he can smell her lavender and vanilla fragrance or Joyce proving that she is worthy to be a slayer's mother. I have given copies of the Trilogy to several of my friends and they all love it as I do. I highly recommend this series. It is excellent horror fiction. Please do yourself a favor.

When Buffy, Willow and Xander look for some harmless non-slaying fun they find more than they bargin for at the carnival. Also a pack of coyotes is terrorizing Sunnydale.

The discord between Willow and Buffy made me uncomfortable even though it was true to the plot. The dialogue was true and gripping. Ethan as always adds spice to any story. The final show down is action packed. I have one problem with the story line and that is Angel. The author didn't seem to know what to do him. He had Angel leaving Buffy alone at times when I'm sure he would not. And the Buffy/Angel relationship lacked either passion or pain. But I enjoyed the book and read it in one sitting. I couldn't put it down.	2000-10-01

Selke, an old enemy of the slayer, is the glue that  holds the stories together. Just to sweeten the plot Spike and Dru make a  cameo appearance with a promise of things to come. The sub plots of a quiz  show, a love sick suitor, and Buffy's driving are not as developed as they  could be. The art work is very detailed. The characters are well drawn  although I believe Willow could be improved. Her face is a bit too rounded.  The action sparkles with color. The vampires are quite nasty and  entertaining. For those who enjoy graphic novels and especially for those  who have read Bad Blood and Remaining Sunlight I recommend this book.	2000-09-15

Taking the story out of Sunnydale  and expanding it to Boston is refreshing. Every element is new and  exciting. Mr Golden and Ms Holder have out done themselves. The action is  fierce and fast. The emotions tear at your heart. The ghost roads a clever  invention.<br /> But with all this the Ritual of Endowment moved me to tears.  I have told everyone I know about this part of the book. Buffy fighting for  her life and her friends prevented from helping her. Instead they are  gathered into a circle to concentrate their love and support into a force  with which to endow the slayer. To me it is symbolic we raise children to  be young adults and send them out in to the world to fight their daily  battles. We can do it for them or with them. All we can hope it that they  know they have our love and support to see them through.  <br />I highly  recommend this book to everyone. I have read it three times.	2000-09-02

The first half of the book sets up the science. The last half  explodes with action. Oz fans will be pleased that he takes a leading role  in this story. Set in the scoobies' senior year Angel's expertise and  strength is called upon through out. A warning,however, to Buffy and Angel  fans there is no romance just breath taking chases and battles. Ms Navarro  mixes humor with the havoc. Angel and Xander bicker. Particular interesting  is the descriptions of Buffy and the scoobie gang by a new Sunnydale  senior. The sub plot which concerns a manager for the Dingos Ate My Baby  fits in neatly.  A well written adventure. I recommend this book	2000-09-02

The old evil, kill it and it returns again and again. An impossible love deny it and it returns over and over again.  <br />I admired the way the authors wove  creative mythology, the stories of  Angel's past and the trauma of Joyce's illness together to create an  excellent story. Mr Golden and Ms Holder present one of the best  representations of the Buffy/Angel relationship. I have actually marked the  pages so I can go back and reread the passion and pain these two star  crossed lovers face. Angel's confession that he can't bear to think of  Buffy's death and that he has actually considered turning her, thus  granting her immortality is chilling.<br /> It's almost redundant to say that  a Golden/Holder book sparkles with action and mystery. Even if you have  never seen an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Angel pick up this  book, Any reader will enjoy this book. Any fan will embrace it. After  reading this novel, a reader will come away considering their own  mortality. I know I did. Can I give it six stars? Please.	2000-09-01

I enjoyed the use of the celtic mythology. Giles cast in the role as babysitter was a hoot. It is a fresh  approach to the hellmouth. I was disappointed that Angel took a backseat in  the action. I would have thought that he would have been more involved  because of the Irish connection. But the story is strong and the characters  well developed. The emotions run high. As Cordelia says &quot;Love removed  so suddenly seems to demand an equally strong emotion to replace it...like  hatred&quot;. Readers should find themselves strongely drawn to this book  as the scoobie gang is drawn to the selkie. I recommend it.	2000-09-01

Bram Stoker created the ultimate vampire from which so much popular  fiction has arisen. But this tale of  a Mummy's curse is not the stuff of  popular movies. It is a rather slow story of a fantastic queen and her  magical power that survives the grave. &quot;Hither the Gods come not at  any summons. The nameless One has insulted them and is forever alone. Go  not nigh, lest their vengeance wither you away!&quot; Is the mummy's curse  and terrible is her vengence. I can't say I liked this book. But I couldn't  stop reading it until the shocking ending. Written in 1903 the language is  of the period. The descriptions are often over done, but an interesting  read none the less.	2000-08-25

But the old evil which Angelus once thought he killed  is back. And this time it threatens more than just vampires. The plot  bridges Angel's past and present and is far superior to the artwork in this  graphic novel. I have only one complaint that Mr Golden didn't save this  story for a full length text novel.	2000-08-09

'Dust' by Michelle West follows Buffy to LA  where she has to battle internal visions and demons. As she gets up close  and personal with the future deaths of her friends and relatives her death  at the master's hands becomes more real. This is the darkest and most  distrubing story. In 'Absalom Rising' by Nancy Holder Vampires steal the  master's bones from Giles. Jenny, Xander and Willow come to his assistance.  Angel  offers his help but Giles has trouble trusting a vampire. 'Looks Can  Kill' by Cameron Dokey is my favorite story. A shapshifter bent on the  slayer's destruction targets her friends in her absence. Angel, Giles and  Jenny track the beast but who do you kill when the beast can look like  anyone. &quot;No Place Like...&quot; By Cameron Dokey is a sweet story of  redemption and love. Buffy sets out to kill a witch and ends up righting an  old wrong. 'Uncle Dead and the Fourth of July' by Yvonne Navarro is a silly  adventure for Jenny,Giles and Angel once again. Giles attempt at American  history are amusing. The last story 'The Show Must Go On'by Paul Ruditis is  a hoot if a bit bloody. Theatre buffs will particularly love it. <br />All in  all a good collection that is true to the mood at the end of the first  season and the beginning of the second. The stories are enjoyable whether  you know the history or not. But for the true fan the references are very  will placed. Angel it would seem is staying close to Xander, Willow,and  Giles because they represent a way to keep close to Buffy. In the last  story he asks Giles to get a message to her since he hasn't heard from her  all summer. Giles is trying to distance Xander and Willow from any danger.  And Jenny Calender is falling in love with the stuffy watcher.<br />I recomend  you spend part of your summer vacation reading these stories and I hope  since this says volume one that another collection for Buffy's junior  summer will follow.	2000-07-30

A powerful Irish magician travels to LA where he hopes to raise the dreaded giant Balor and rule the world. A Hollywood studio head struggles to keep his job. Kate tries to track down a gang of bank robbers who have  killed three people. Doyle has a brain splitting vision of a young girl in  trouble. These plots are all part of a puzzle framed by fear, greed, anger  and regret. And when the pieces are all fit together a new image of Angel  appears more human than we have seen him before except perhaps with Buffy.  Trapped by strong magics Angel must face the ultimate death.<br /> The story  moves at a fast past. The pages are heavy with demons and villians. The  fastbacks are kept to a single sad incident. Hollywood and the Otherworld  blend surprisingly well together.<br /> This is an excellent addition to the  Angel series. Even if a reader has never watched the TV shows they can  enjoy this book	2000-07-27

Segments from the scripts  are used to illustrate the monster's powers and effect on the slayer and  her friends.In addition to detailing every creature that has crawled across  the television screen in the first four seasons of Buffy.

The main plot is contrived. Didi seeing the dairy industry and her practice failing goes to a convention in Atlantic City to bone up on the  latest techniques in the horse industry. When she wittnesses the death of  one of the speakers, the widow seeks her out and offers her a small fortune  to edit her husband's book in Florida. But more people die and Didi thinks  she is next. The clues are obtuse and the motive undetectable. It needs to  be explained in the final chapter.<br />Back home Charlie is running amuck  again. A little of Charlie goes a long way and this was way more than I  needed. On the other hand, Rose and Allie provided the most interesting  subplot. And because of it I am very eager to read the next book in this  normally excellent series.	2000-07-16

But the author wastes no time filling the reader in on much of the history from  the first book. So its a bit like coming into a nighttime soap in the  second year of the series. I would strongly suggest that readers buy and  read Sips of Blood first before cracking the cover on this one. Ms Mitchell  lets her characters drive the story. For that reason I liked the first book  better. Some of the most fascinating charaters were left behind. This story  centered on the least enjoyable pair a father and son in a life long  struggle of love and hate seasoned with guilt. Sade was entertaining as  ever. His attempt to Henry Higgins the new inexperienced vampire was very  interesting. The book ends with nothing but loose ends nothing resolved and  so many possiblities that I can't wait for book three.	2000-07-12

I expected an historical novel of vampires much like the Saint Germain and Dracula's wives series written by Chelsea Quinn Yarbo instead I found a  moderm story filled with disfunctional humans and wickedly sensual  vampires. Louis Sade is what you would expect vicious and controling. His  mother in law is straight from hell and his lovely niece is so sad and  lonely. She breaks your heart. The character development is the strength of  this novel. The plot takes a while to come together. I would highly  recommend this to adult vampire horror fans but I would not suggest it for  teens.	2000-07-11

What is really amazing is how the author guides the reader into  the story and the personality of Bast. I find that I feel her confusion,  joy, sorrow and fear. In the first book Speak Daggers to Her the murder?  stirs Bast's anger. In the second book The Book of Moons Bast is stalked by  the killer. Her peril is so real that I found my heart racing. The last  novel The Bowl of Night the author gives us a wonderful lesson that just as  there are all kinds of Christians, there are all kind of Pagans but  fanatics are just as dangerous no matter what their religion. The solution  to the mystery broke my heart even though I solved the crime much sooner  than Bast.<br />This is an excellent collection. I hope she write more tales  of Lady Bast.	2000-07-08

The plot is complex but the writing is difficult at best. When the author concentrates on action the story flows but when  she adds description the story bogs down with complex sentences that you  often have to read once or twice to understand her meaning. I found that  her continuing characters had feet of clay. I was more sympathic toward the  murderer than the hero. There are three lovely moments the death of a cat,  the tale of ancient atrocities and a mother's notification of a child's  death which brought a tear to my eye and kept me reading to the end. This  is the only book in the series that I have read but I am not planning on  tracking down the others.	2000-06-24

But all that seems pale in the face of the ordinary 'film at eleven'crimes which break out all across town including a perfectly  normal boy who kills his parents and shots up Sunnydale High landing Giles,  Xander and Willow in the hospital. It seems more like a job for the  Sunnydale police than a slayer. But under the city is a old evil, a  vampire, Angel's former lover, well known as a killer of slayers. This time  even Angel and Giles think that there is little chance that Buffy will  survive.A strange madness grips all the inhabitants of Sunnydale including  the slayers friends and family. Will her friends end Buffy's life to save  their own or will Buffy destroy Angel to save her friends.And will it take  the sacrifice of a child to save the town's occupants from the evil which  lies sleeping in their hearts. I preordered this book last summer and it  was worth the wait. Excellent story with both action and charater  interaction. I opened the carton and didn't put the book down until it was  done.

The erotic seduction of the  young girl was breath taking without being explicit. As usual the historic  detail is excellent. This book pulses with passion, action and horror.

High school reunions can be murder but in this case it is literally true. The returning class mates have more than wrinkles,added pounds and bald spots to worry about. Someone is killing the class one by one and Harry is  a suspect and possibly the next victem. The suspense builds from page to  page as the committee plans the big event, Harry buys a new truck, and both  Harry and Miranda are wooed by old flames. As usual the animals are a step  ahead of the humans and come to the rescue when needed. I love this series.  After reading the stories I take a good look at my cats and wonder what  they are saying about me. Also the wisdom of Mrs Murphy always leaves me  with a new thought to ponder like why do humans have to have flat faces.  This is a book to cozy up with on a sunny afternoon.

A battle to the death in the 18th century drives Angel to protect a lovely innocent actress who is not a vampire but plays one on TV. The intense  hunger for her blood, her life which once drove him to destroy her is now  replaced by an irrational desire for atonement. But is she the same woman  who had vowed to kill the vicious Angelus? Has her hate kept her alive for  200 years for one purpose and one purpose alone...to kill the vampire who  took her life? The story ripples with action and danger. Cults,spirits,  bookies and the LAPD insist on interferring in Angel's quest for  redemption. Doyle and Cordelia provide the comic relief with their friendly  bickering. Especially amusing is Cordelia suggesting that they make a TV  series out of Angel's life. I strongly recommend this book.

After Falcon at the Portal I wasn't sure I wanted to read another. The characters  acted so out of character that I was depressed for days. But this  installment is witty and entertaining. The adventures kept me on the edge  of my chair. Danger lurks around every corner. The war provides an  interesting backdrop for the events which disrupt the digging season.  Romance is in the air providing more twists and turns than a Shakespearean  comedy. And it is so delightful to imagine what goes on after the door is  locked and Emerson seeks to distract his Peabody.<br />In the end Ms Peters  ties all the plots together in a superb finish. It is sad to have to say  goodbye to some of the recurring characters but I have no fear that they  will be replaced by exciting new ones in the next volume <br />Ms Peters does  spend many words trying to justify the events of the last book. While I  still have some doubts it does help to tie up lose ends. I would highly  recommend this book to anyone who loves good mysteries, heroic men and  strong women	2000-06-09

But the flash backs between Angel's life, Meg's life and the  past often break up the action. In the end as masks are removed and  villians become victems there is no satisfaction and much confusion.  Angel's encounter with an dying old woman is the most touching I've read in  a long time. I almost wished for an epilogue in which Angel finds the child  and passes the memory so she is not forgotten. I enjoyed the book but the  plotting is not Ms Holder's best.	2000-04-05

Like the first in the series I couldn't put it down until the last page at 4AM. The description of life in Venice  was so vivid I could hear the water lapping. I highly recommend this book  and series and can't wait for number three.	2000-03-11
