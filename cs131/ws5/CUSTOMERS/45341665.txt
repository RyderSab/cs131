After the great work he did breaking up the mind controlling cult in THE PROGRAM, deputy U. S. Marshall Tim Rackley is once again back on the job.  This time around he's assigned as head of the task force formed to track down Den Laurey, leader of the violent biker gang the Laughing Sinners, who escapes custody while being transported to San Bernardino County Jail, leaving two U. S. Marshals dead.  Laurey is known for his knife skills and was convicted of torture killing of three rival gang members in retaliation for the shooting of a Sinner.  He's armed and dangerous, but not alone.  With him is Lance Kaner, the gang's enforcer, and together the two are a lethal combination.  With Bear and Guerrera again at his side, Rackley works day and night trying to find leads.  At one point it seems as if he's got a good chance of apprehending them, but a situation arises that leaves him no choice but let them go, which results in the shooting of a sheriff's deputy not far from the scene.  The wounded deputy turns out to be his wife Drey, who also happens to be eight months pregnant, which results in feelings of guilt and frustration.  While still trying to deal with the loss of his daughter Ginny, who was murdered years ago, he must put his personal feelings aside and put an end to the violence, especially after the gang goes on a violent rampage in preparation for a drug deal of a new string of heroin which leads the marshals from Mexico to Afghanistan.<br /><br />TROUBLESHOOTER is a great addition to the Rackley series!  It's filled with so much action and suspense you just can't turn the pages fast enough.  Gregg Hurwitz is one of my favorite authors, and in my opinion one of today's greatest suspense writers.  He's got a style all his own and has never disappointed me yet, so if you haven't already discovered this great author I recommend you do so today!	2005-09-11

Scott Finn was orphaned at an early age and had a rough upbringing, spending most of it trying to survive on the tough streets of Boston, yet he managed to pull himself out and now he's on his way to being partner at a big law firm.  Life is good, that is until the day they find the body of his friend and former lover Natalie Caldwell floating in the Boston Harbor.  He is grief stricken, and becomes determined to make sure they find who killed her.<br /><br />The police think it's the work of a serial killer they named \\"Little Jack\\" because it seems to fit his MO, and after they apprehend him he confesses to all the murders, with the exception of Natalie's.  The detective in charge of the investigation, Linda Flaherty, and her partner have doubts that he's lying about not killing Natalie, but because they are strongly pressured into closing the case no one wants to hear about it.  Therefore, Flaherty conducts her own investigation and eventually finds out Natalie and Finn were lovers, plus it seems he was the last person to see her alive, so he becomes the focus of her investigation.  Now he has to find a way to prove his innocence, and his former life on the streets may be the only thing that helps him.  In the meantime, he is thrown in to replace Natalie in a high profile case defending a security company being sued for wrongful death in a terrorist bombing of a commuter train.  It's quite a story because he finds out that it's possible Natalie made some enemies in high places while working the case, and he uncovers things he never expected.  He fights hard to clear his name but the evidence keeps piling up against him and even though he knows someone is setting him up he can't prove it, until finally he's arrested and charged with murder.  This story has great characters, nonstop action, and so many twists and turns that my attention was glued to the pages to find out what happens!<br /><br />DARK HARBOR is in no way your usual legal thriller; it's better!  I wouldn't be surprised if it makes the bestseller list, and fast.  Newcomer David Hosp has a style all his own and I have a feeling we haven't seen the last of this great new author.

I have read the whole Eve Duncan series and although I found COUNTDOWN to be a very good story there was something missing.  It was fast paced and I read it quickly, but it revolved around Eve & Joe's adopted daughter Jane, and I was really disappointed that they were hardly ever mentioned.

Once in a while he tries something different, and with each novel he's getting better and better.  DARK EYES, in my opinion, is his best work yet, and I highly recommend it.  I've heard it referred to as Silence of the Lambs meets Rain Man, and the person who said that hit the nail right on the head!<br /><br />Susan Pulaski is a psychologist who is also grieving the loss of her husband, which results in her becoming an alcoholic though she's not yet ready to admit it.  After a violent incident that happened during one of her drinking binges she winds up in detox and then things go from bad to worse.  She loses her job, her house, and custody of her niece who she's been raising for years.  Desperately trying to get her life back in order she asks for her job back, but all she gets to be is a consultant on the case of a crazed serial killer obsessed with the works of Edgar Allen Poe who is kidnapping & killing young girls.  He sends coded messages that even the experts can't solve.<br /><br />Then she meets Darcy O'Bannon, a twenty-five year old autistic savant, who just happens to be the son of her boss Chief Robert O'Bannon, and her life changes.  Darcy is able to solve these coded messages and together the two of them try to find a way to catch this killer.  The relationship between these two characters is so touching that I was simply mesmerized by it, as well as the whole story.<br /><br />I've read many, many novels in my day and finding a story in which I feel so much compassion for the characters doesn't happen everyday, but it did in this novel.  I was so taken in by them that I could help but cry at the end.  I think an author who can write like that has a truly great gift, and William Bernhadrt has definitely become that type of author.<br /><br />DARK EYE will scare you out of your wits,  make you laugh, then make you cry and you won't want it to end.  Do yourself a favor and read it today.<br /><br />Janet Slezak	2005-02-05
