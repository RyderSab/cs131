I thought I was buying  a handy little decorating book to take with me when I shop, but that isn't what I received. This book is an encyclopedia of decorating and furniture terms. That's all it is. There is nothing in here that is helpful to me as I shop for decorating products. If I need a listing of terms, I can go to the dictionary, for heaven's sake. So, this isn't a Pocket Decorating Guide but a Pocket Dictionary.  How that is supposed to help me decorate my home, I can't imagine.	2004-07-02

Unexpected style is something that intrigues me, but that's not what this book actually is. The book is pretty dated in the way it is done because it's all about one unknown designer's &quot;take&quot; on decorating.  No one today wants to be dictated to or to just copy what another person has done. So this book misses the mark by several miles. If you want a decorating book that helps you create your own style, this is not it. Don't buy this. It seems more like a book about this designer's own ego.	2004-05-24

It actually has heart and soul. It doesn't pander tothe royals, but it also doesn't drag them through the mud. It is balanced and seems to have come from a place of personal ethics in terms of how it was written and what topics it covers.  Mr. Burrell's absolute passion for the queen and the monarcy, not to mention Diana, is obvious, as is his respect for the royals. Layered into the story is information about how his own family life with his wife and sons fit into and was affected by his almost 24/7 work in various palaces. This is an interesting, intriguing, inside look at the life of an obviously loyal and loving member of the royals' staff. Unlike some frankly bitchy books about the royals, my hands did NOT feel dirty when I put this book down. Far from it. I felt uplifted.	2003-11-05

It can't, but I feel that this book does a pretty amazing job of covering all the bases. I like the variety of rooms which seem to be newly created for this book. Either that or I have forgotten if I've seen them on my favorite HGTV shows. I really appreciated the how-to-do-it projects which give me more information than a lot of the HGTV  shows actually show  or more information than I can scribble down while I watch the shows.  This book will keep me busy for a long time as there is a lot to look at (gorgeous photos), a lot of explanations of how to plan a room decorating project, and many how-to projects for every room in the house.	2003-11-05

The title talks a good game but the contents don't deliver to homeowners, including affluent ones, who want to go home and relax after work. The rooms are so refined, so perfect, so staid, so unlivable that they seem like a throwback to a decade or two ago. They certainly don't fit today, and I'm sorry I bought this.	2003-09-30

I buy a lot of decorating  books, but New Classic Style is so chic  yet so helpful all at the same time. The premise, which is carried out stylishly by the  photos,  involves mixing classic furnishings from all eras and genres to create &quot;personal&quot; style. The book is so what I'm all about and what I see my friends doing. I've never seen a book on how to create your own mix before.	2003-03-19

I couldn't wait to get my copy of the book, and I wasn't disappointed. I wanted to know more about every designer on the show. Except Doug. I thought I couldn't stand him, but I thought his photos were great, and I liked him more after reading the story about him. There's more in this book than  you can get anywhere else. If you love the show, this is a must-read.  It's packed with pictures, decorating tips from the cast, and details about the cast's real lives.	2003-03-18

As a Boomer who's been breaking the rules for decades and who's never met a flowery or chintz fabric she LIKED, I figured I'd love this book. wrong. It's just a mess inside. Breaking the rules is not an excuse for creating a mess. And there are a lot of messes in this book.	2002-12-20

It's the first decorating book I've ever read cover to cover, and I've marked a zillion pages with sticky notes so I can go back and use them again. I love all the big color photos and the chance to see Lynette's own homes. You can buy the book for the pictures alone and get your money's worth. But then when you sit down and start reading it, it grabs you. Lynette writes in first person, so reading this is like having her talking  one-on-one to me. Highly recommend.	2002-04-19

I was a little disappointed with the book because it seems to me that I've seen all of these ideas before. And I have seen them again and again. What the book shows has a dated look to it. A little too traditional and provincial for me. Maybe that's because I live in a city where I see more new ideas all the time or maybe what is shown, while not bad, is just aimed at a different and older reader.(Maybe amazon should print its reviewers' ages!)	2001-11-29

It sounded interesting and had a nice fat look to it. But take the booklets out of the cardboard box they are in, and you find a booklet with some information and then a fatter book that is nothing but blank pages. I wouldn't mind if this sold for [dollar amount] or something, but it's nearly [dollar amount]! The so-called 192 pages are mostly blank!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the bit of information in the booklet is nothing new, nothing special, definitely not worth it. I am angry about spending that kind of money for so little.	2001-11-29

I bought one for my husband and myself, and now family and friends keep borrowing it. So, I am buying a few copies for holiday and birthday gifts. The book is dreamy yet practical and has ideas you can use in a second home or in any house, really. My father said he likes it because it was like a travel book and it took him to places all over the country. My sister said she likes it because it gave her decorating ideas. I like it because I'm still dreaming about what kind of second home we might have someday and I need help in deciding what I really want. To each his own!	2001-08-15

The book is a fun read and filled with stylish (and varied) homes from around the country, but it is giving me one idea after another for making the most of tight spaces. (In our part of the country, we cannot afford a large home.) I have gotten and used several storage ideas, but what I like best are the room arranging ideas and tips on color. This is a 5-star book all around.	2001-07-02

An hour later, I realized that I was still sitting there not wanting to put the book down, so I ordered it from amazon (better price). The book is is a large size with lovely heavy paper and gorgeous BIG photos showing a variety of current country  looks (romantic, modern, traditional). This is one of the prettiest and most inspiring books I have seen in a long time. Highly recommend.	2001-05-11

This book shows how to decorate any home in a way that makes it feel like a weekend house. I already have marked lots of pages that have ideas I plan to use. The newer book, called SECOND HOME: FINDING YOUR PLACE IN THE FUN goes one step further and shows real second homes around the country. SECOND HOME covers everything from choosing a second home location and home style to decorating. Both books are like little getaways or destinations in themselves, because I love sitting, relaxing, and looking at all the pictures. Both books also make me believe that I really can, first, turn my present home into a &quot;getaway&quot; and, second, actually find, buy, and decorate a real second home some time in the future.	2001-05-02

I appreciated seeing events through other characters' eyes for a change (instead of only through Father Tim's). This book deepens all the characters in a series that's not exactly known for its profound character development. The only negative is that the book is shorter than the others. I don't blame the author, who said in interviews last year that she would be writing a mini book about the wedding. What I see is the publisher's greed in trying to publish a small book in a large book format and at a large book price. Shame on the publisher! However, the book IS STILL WORTH IT IF YOU LOVE THE MITFORD SERIES.Or, wait a few months, and you can buy a softcover version at the right price!	2001-04-16

I am not in the market for a second home, but I am looking for great ideas for the well-designed, charming, smaller cottage we hope to build. We are so dissatisfied with all the plans builders are showing us and need alternatives. This book is full of wonderful small and midsized homes that have charm and character. We have decided that we want a &quot;vacation type&quot; house wherever we end up building. To us, that means something cozy and warm and functional with lots of windows and a casual, welcoming feeling,whoch is what we are finding on page after page in this Second Home book. I think they should have named this book Great Little Houses No Matter Where You Live.	2001-04-12

It's difficult to use, to act on. It looked interesting, and I like the idea of learning more about my own tastes and why I like what I do. It's just that the book didn't fulfill its promise.  In searching for help in this area, I came across The New Decorating Book, which has made it easier for me to understand my own tastes and also has taught me the design basics I need to decorate my own home. The book even has a quiz which helps people to understand their decorating personalities. My daughter's home ec class was using The New Decorating Book, which is how I found it. I also like Real Life Decorating, because that book gives me ideas and talks about understanding how my personality and lifestyle affect how I decorate my home.	2001-03-14

This is one of those. After wasting money on several other decorating books, I finally found this one, which was being used to teach design in my daughter's home ec class. The book is outstanding. It has a quiz to help me understand more about how my personality plays out in my decorating style, and it's absolutely filled with great color photos of all rooms types and decorating styles. It's great just to look at. But the book explains and explains and explains design basics on every page from cover to cover. It's not like a textbook at all, because the writing is quick to read---it gets to the point quickly and in a way I can understand immediately. If you want lots of help, encouragement to do your own thing, and ideas, ideas, ideas, this is the book for you.	2001-03-14

Instead of talking about good design, he digs right in to &quot;decorating,&quot; which in this case means layering on the junk. One shouldn't start with paint (or fabric) or anything of the sort. Good design begins with good over all use of space. It's only after one decides how a room will be used and gets the basic furnishings in place to carry out that function that one can -- at the END, not the beginning -- put the finishing touches on in the form of color, texture, and so on. I think Mr. Lowell would make a good cake decorator, but a designer he's not.	2001-03-06

I found a much better book that gives the same freeing message but with more sound and sophisticated results. It's called Flea Market Decorating.

So, last week I sent a copy to my aunt, who called yesterday to say that everything stopped when she received her copy from UPS. &quot;I sat down, and three hours went by before I realized it,&quot; she told me. The book is like a little vacation. You can't open it without sitting down and relaxing with it for awhile. And yet the homes are so accessible. This is not a snob's book. Most of the homes while beautifully designed make me feel that I can actually afford my own second home someday. And there is information in the book on how to make that happen, too.	2001-02-19

I agree with the point of the book, which seems to be that decorating should be fun and free and creative. But there are so many magazines and books around that do the job so much better than this one. If you want to end up with a tacky mishmash of a home, then this is the book for you. If you want the same &quot;be yourself&quot; message with some great ideas and solid design guidance along the way, you'd better look elsewhere. The rooms in this book look like ticky-tacky crammed stores more than homes. It would drive me crazy to spend much time in such cluttered rooms. Like many today, I am looking for peace and harmony at home versus a mess. I can't even think of anyone to give this book to, so it goes in the trash.	2001-02-14

The photos aren't that great, the projects stretch out for pages, the content is limited, and the message of empowerment and doing your own thing is nothing new and is actually conveyed better in many other books I have bought. To be empowered and free to be brave and do your own thing means that you need to know more about design. If you don't, you stuckwith simply copying what someone like Christopher Lowell tells you. It means doing your thing -- not his. And Mr. Lowell is not an accredited interior designer. I recommend several other books, because they are  giving me the background I need so that I can make my own decisions. My favorite is The New Decorating Book, which is gorgeous and informative. I also like Use What You Have Decorating -- which is not very attractive but offers some good ideas in the writing.	2001-02-13
