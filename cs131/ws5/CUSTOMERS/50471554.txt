Example, Jake's return, Jake's abandonment, Jake being naive about Sheila &amp; Jake's attitude upon his return - no apology - no explanation or reason for his abandonment.  There was a definite change in Tori, but Jake's change was non-existence - did Jake really make any sacrifices?  NO!  I agree with Aunt Kate - leave the Madison men ALONE.	2002-05-14

This book had an OK storyline, but the two main characters are silly, immature &amp; just plain stupid.

If these are the type of men that are available in the dating scene, then women have a very small selection of eligible bachelors.
