Our heroine Abby Grant is now dead, and the torch has been passed to her son Peter. Eyers' work indulges in far more primitivism and blurring of the lines regarding who the good guys and bad guys are than did Nation's. For some this book may even appeal slightly more than the original Survivors book upon which it was inspired depending upon your expectations of human behavior within the context of a whole new set of rules.	2005-09-01

A faultlessly amusing and facinating insight into England's peculiar penchant for churning out eccentrics. Though I suspect these are becoming more scarce in the contemporary rarified air of England's PC culture. What makes these characters so readable is their collective yet accepted strangeness within the collage of the English people. Even a nation as individualistic as the United States cannot claim to have the historical wealth of wierdos that England has.<br />I found it noteworthy that not a few of the eccentrics highlighted by Timpson have found their calling as men of the cloth or have come from the gentrified classes. No shortage of oddballs with Sir or Reverend at the front of their name. Reverend Teddy Boston for instance has an operating steam railway in his backyard. Reverend Ronald Lancaster the 'Pyrotechnic Parson' engages in setting of some of the largest fireworks displays in the world.<br />Tremendous fun to read, and a celebration of the idiosyncratic tendancy towards freedom of action and thought among traditional English.	2005-09-01

A foreboding tale, with a prescient quality regarding the fragility of humankind and the social edifices we have constructed; I must confess to preferring the TV series somewhat more. The reader is subliminally enjoined to be one of the Survivors, after an apparent biotechnology accident wipes out virtually the entire human race. Pared back to basics, with only the remnants of technology and our modern way of life to cling to, the monumental task of those who have not been killed by the sickness, is simply to go on living. Terry Nation cleverly helps us imagine the mechanics of a back to zero world and the tenuous human interactions therein. 'Survivors' is compelling and daunting, with a definite feel of future reality to it. Though not in my opinion as phenomenal a work as the TV series, it receives 5 stars from me as an adjunct and outline to a simply masterful piece of story telling by Terry Nation. NOTE: A sequel exists written by John Eyers called \\"Survivors Genesis of a Hero,\\" a surprisingly convincing continuation of the Survivors saga.	2005-09-01

Author Donald F. Wood has painted his subject matter with a very broad brush, to the extent that for most bus folks, the inclusion of some of the vehicles such as limos etc is a bit of a stretch (pun intended). Wood justifies this in the introduction by citing obscure government regulations that define a bus as any vehicle carrying ten or more passengers. The non-bus buses are a minor distraction though in this otherwise deftly researched book. The photographs are all black and white, but they offer a facinating retrospective to the material in conjunction with the well written text. Not all the buses are American, though all discussed operate or did operate in the USA. All in all good value for money and well worth adding to the shelf.	2005-08-19

The plot is a familiar one: Jingoistic American living abroad ridiculing the natives as an attempt at satire cum commentary. Pitman's tepid essays on the English romp from warm beer, bad teeth and irritating Anglo eccentricities, to more jabbing jibes such as Britain's treatment of Ireland and its Official Secrets Act (a state provision in which the government of Britain can determine with impunity whether to prevent certain actions and activities being known by the public). Displaying hallmark American hubris, Pitman reminds the reader of America's Freedom of Information Act, and the alleged immutability of the US Constitution. The State can't get away with keeping secrets from the populace in the land of the free and the home of the brave dontcha know.<br /><br />Of course, Pitman wasn't to know when he wrote this book in the 1980s, that a war against terrorism in the United States and a subsequent bill called the Patriot Act would effectively castrate the US Constitution. So now the US government keep secrets too, and it spys upon its citizens, and it imprisons people without charge or access to judicial process. The USA even has it's own version of Ireland too over in Iraq, though on a far more spectacular scale naturally.<br /><br />More pointedly though is that Pitman's criticisms of England are often countered by comparisons with Americans, that at best are fanciful, at worst farcical. One delicious pontification is this: \\"Thus, being open and egalitarian, Americans characteristically speak in a straightforward, declarative manner, discounting jargon from the Pentagon or any other fog bog.\\" As an Englishman living for years among Americans, and as fond of many of them though I am, I nonetheless couldn't disagree more about Pitman's claim of American straightforwardness. Calling a toilet \\"the restroom\\" is just one of many examples of linguistic pussy-footing Americanisms that springs to mind.<br /><br />As for discounting jargon, I do hope the author is stillalive and well watching the Office of Homeland Security leg-hump the civil liberties of Americans and the current treatment of the US Constitution as a dirty diaper by the American government. Some of the quirky limey anecdotes cited in the opening few pages are often very funny it must be said, but as the author progresses the book degrades into a dogmatic dirge.	2004-05-30

There is a self-deprecating honesty to the book, since Tony and his hooligan mates don't win all their confrontations, and admit to being intimidated by opponents on several occasions. The designer label name dropping exemplifies the sartorial obsessions of the hooligan Casual scene, which appear to be as important as kicking the daylights out of some &quot;up for it&quot; blokes from another firm. The peculiar phenomenon of organized gangs of men (many into their 40s) attacking each other as a sport, in the name of a sport will strike many as repugnant and nihilistic. The sociologists and assorted boffins who attempt to mitigate this behavior by apportioning blame to 'lack of opportunities' and other throwaway vacuous slogans miss the point. Gangs like the Soul Crew exist purely because their members find acts of mass violence thrilling and cathartic. Tony Rivers &amp; David Jones eloquently make this clear.	2003-09-30

Things to be glad about are the individuals quoted in the books who have forged a happy, comfortable mixed-race identity; this in spite of the agendas of the British social worker community which still militantly denies that there are social and identity issues affecting mixed race children that differ from black children. One white social worker interviewed for the books states this position thus: 'I will not have you using terms like \\"mixed-race.\\" In this department, the children are black if they are not white. That is all there is to say about their identity. If a white child says he is not white, would you correct him? So if a half-African child says he is not black, I just correct him.'<br />Small wonder that many mixed race people who have been unfortunate enough to become wards of the State in Britain show an alarmingly high rate of social problems in adulthood.<br /><br />Nonetheless stable families abound in the book, and the adult children interviewed are largely confident, and happy. Britain has the highest rate of interracial marriage in the world, and consequently this trend is changing that nation's profile in an abundance of areas.<br /><br />Alibhai-Brown does a generally excellent job of expounding upon her subject matter. It is well researched, and intelligently presented. She takes some pot-shots at Britain's Conservative Party for the crass xenophobia exhibited by a handful of the old guard. She is less forthright in attacking the extreme left-wing ideologies that underpin the rabid, intractable ethos of many of Britain's social workers. She also misses noting the role that the UK's craddle to grave welfare state contibutes to fatherless children.<br />On the whole it's mostly good news for Britain's burgeoning mixed race population, though clearly some other areas needreview and change.	2003-02-10

Eric Schlosser, doesn't like the fast food industry, and neither do I. In fact I've never eaten a Big Mac or a Chicken MacNugget in my life. I have been quietly and privately vegetarian since my early youth, and thankfully so after reading this. This treatise is generally well written and engaging. We are allowed a fly on the wall purview of the at once Neanderthal and techno-obsessive world of the burger barons.<br /><br />While I can agree with Schlosser that the industry and its affiliates are pretty scummy and intractably bottom-line focused, the author (a journalist by profession) is predictably and unfortunately a lefty and staunch acolyte of the Nanny State. While assuring us that this industry can be made more decent, more safe and more healthy if only we could shovel enough funds at the variegated governmental regulatory agencies, lost on Schlosser, are the examples of successful free-market checks and balances that he highlights. We learn that Jack In The Box, after poisoning (and killing) a number of customers by serving E. Coli infected burgers, takes extraordinary measures to clean up its act and that of its meat packers. This was done to prevent them from going out of business, not from any special pressure exerted upon them by the State. Absent in entirety is any chastisement of the lack of personal responsibility exercised by parents who raise their kids on this crap (some of it literal, as we come to learn from his visits to slaughterhouses). Not once are parents of teenagers who work behind the counters bought to task by Schlosser. Adult employees of the industry are viewed, with typical liberal paternalism, as victims. At one point we are privy to the tragicomedy travails of Kenny Dobbins, an illiterate slaughterhouse worker and union buster, who accumulates a massive shopping list of work related injuries ranging from broken limbs, to chemical poisonings, yet for some odd reason, never rationalizes that he might be safer in a different line of work.<br /><br />Congress should ban all advertising aimed at kids and \\"fight against dangerous concentrations of economic power\\" by the McDonald's of the world concludes Schlosser. He then inadvertently speaks the real truth about how to affect changes within this industry, observing: \\"Nobody in the United States, is forced to buy fast food. The first step towards meaningful change is by far the easiest: stop buying it.\\"<br />Until that happens, no amount of government tinkering will stop a free people making bad choices about what they and their children eat.	2003-02-01

The cover blurb proclaims \\"Anarchy, Sex Pistols, Punk Rock, and Beyond.\\" What it really is, is an obsessively detailed work about the Sex Pistols, with punk as a background theme. Several chapters are mired in minutiae that really should have stayed in Savage's research folder, and the repetitive deeper meanings that the he reads into things such as song lyrics, clothing, and behavior are often embarrassingly psuedo-academic. What disappointed me most about the book, was the abrupt ending and the feeling it left of lack of closure.

To put into perspective the greatness of this feat, consider that this rebellion lead to the largest Roman defeat in over 300 years, pitting peasant Britons against well equiped and militarily advanced Roman legions.<br />Fry tends to accept as read Roman historical accounts of the barbarism enacted by Boudica's army as they ransacked Colchester and London. Since we only have the written words of Romans to document this uprising, I tend to believe a losing army would be inclined to paint a more derogatory picture of their opponents than was perhaps accurate. This notwithstanding, the book is is a stiring if economical account of arguably the greatest female military leader the world has ever witnessed. Boudica's rebellion was short lived, but it was nonetheless brilliant.<br />Read also: &quot;Boadicea&quot; by J.M. Scott, ISBN 0 09 459580 1 (out of print)	2002-03-13

Tragically Kurtz drags humanism down the well worn path of global collectivism in keeping with the socialist slant that underpins much of this manifesto's yearnings and regrettably much of the Humanist leadership and community.<br /><br />The call for an international government body and the policing of various entities under a type of global judicial fiat that Kurtz waxes poetic for should chill the bones of the reader who believes in liberty and human rights grounded in individual responsibilities. Kurtz offers a vision for the future which is in monolithic antipathy to those of us who have recognized the necessity of a libertarian focus if we are to achieve a successful, sustainable humanist aim.<br /><br />The appeal for a mega-state that Kurtz places his humanism faithfully within, is inimical to those who celebrate freed minds and freed lives. The idea of the state as benevolent social guardian and moral arbiter has seduced academics and peasants alike for ages. Yet history shows that the more a society predicates its future upon the ever growing machinations of the state, the greater individuals suffer. I have no reason to believe a worldwide governing body would fare any better, no matter how humanist based it claimed to be. A libertarian based humanist manifesto has yet to be penned or even cogently voiced, but its time is long overdue .	2001-11-11

This is a bold work, often as strident as it is amusing. Though I share a libertarian commonality with Larry, this book contains occasions of simplistic naivete in its reading of data that are disappointing. Larry, an ardent supporter of firearms as a panacea for a multitude of criminal ills presents arguments in this area that show he often assumes facts rather than proving them. Using Britain's ever tightening gun control laws and increasing crime rates, Larry implies a cause and effect. Aside from quoting a few hysterical British tabloid headlines, Mr. Elder fails to show a correlation between British gun control and increases in crime in that nation...perhaps because there is none. Even before the most recent gun control laws, there were only 1.2 million legal firearms in Britain, the vast majority of which were held by rural shotgun owning landowners or sporting handgun enthusiasts. Some food for thought: England and Wales, with a combined population of over 52 million had 729 reported homicides with 677 recorded as such in 1994 (Home Office Data). Los Angeles/Long Beach metropolitan area, with a population of around 9 million in 1994 had 1669 murders (University of Virginia Library, Geospatial &amp; Statistical Data Center). Crimes of violence accounted for 4% of all notifiable offenses in England and Wales in 1994 while US data suggests figures over 30%. Further muddying his ill-conceived gun advocation treatise, Larry goes on to inform the reader that America's larger minority population &quot;who kill or are killed&quot; are a factor in the higher murder rate of the US compared to England. One wonders then why London with an ethnic minority population of 40% (London's Guardian newspaper, 9/03/2000) and an overall population of over 7 million does not have similar murder rates to Los Angeles, a US city with a similar population demographic? To compare the two nations for thepurposes of showing that more guns equals less crime is not just foolish it is untenable. When dissecting the predations of Affirmative Action, Larry uses an economics model with no referent in reality. Describing how market forces destroy racism, Larry suggests that workplace racism cannot be fostered under free market forces. He presents the &quot;case&quot; of 500 white workers at $5.00 p/h juxtaposed against 500 black workers at $4.75 p/h. This let's pretend scenario bears no relation to the real-life effects of workplace discrimination in which individuals are passed over for promotions and so forth for reasons of racial prejudice by senior staff with no monetary interest in the decision.  I have hit upon what I perceive to be the books lows, but in Elder's defense &quot;The Ten Things You Can't Say In America&quot; does a sound job of trouncing the havoc played upon society by the Racism professionals and blackness certifiers of the Soul Patrol; the demented and anti-American  &quot;War on Drugs;&quot; the welfare state and its spawning of generations of desocialized citizens and unparented children and the Republicrat monopoly on US politics. It's not a great book, but it is a worthwhile and challenging read.	2000-10-05

July 19th 1963 Cooper fought Cassius Clay. In the fourth round  Cooper dumped clay on the canvas with his famous left hook, Henry's Hammer.  Clearly in serious trouble Clay was saved by the bell. Sensing dire  problems for his fighter, trainer, Angelo Dundee in Clay's corner managed  to deliberately slit the glove of his fighter (Dundee later admitted having  done this on British TV in the late 1980's). When an age had passed and the  glove replaced, Clay recovered his senses and went on to defeat the often  paper-thin skinned Cooper on cuts.  This is just one of the many engaging  accounts of the illustrious career of one of Britain's finest fighters that  the book tells. This book is a facinating life story tale of Londoner  Cooper, a terrific and colorful recital of the ups and downs of  professional boxing.	2000-08-15

Despite this, the book is a facinating autopsy of the mass psychology of religion (in this case, Jehovah's Witnesses) and the deceptions and nonsense that adherents will endlessly accept. Written prior to the year 1984, the book accurately foretells the more recent doctrinal changes within the &quot;Organization&quot; as once again Jehovah's Witnesses reinvent their theology when even they can no longer stand the weight of its absurdity. The publication is refreshingly funny and easy to read, especially if, like me, you were raised in the bizzare siege mentality culture of Jehovah's Witnesses with its oddball idiomatic peculiarities and Armageddon hysteria. The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses ends on a profoundly accurate prediction, noting that no matter which prophesies fail to materialise or which marked dates pass without event, JW's will continue to grow in number while members eagerly anticipate the day their god Jehovah starts a war on humanity destroying &quot;this system of things&quot; and all the evil people within it (though not his faithful flock of witnesses of course).

Peter Fryer does a splendid job of tracing their history from the days of Roman conquest up until the  present day. This book is written in substantial part as commentary, in an  easy, accesable style.  Unfortunately, and perhaps indicative of a liberal  paternalistic bent, Fryer never views the history of black Britons as  anything but troubled and strife filled. Though it is clear that the  British held a complicit and major role in the transatlantic slave trade,  Fryer is unwilling to laud or commend the treatment of black people living  in Britain during this period. There is a glaring omission in his failure  to juxtapose the treatment and application of justice endured by black  people living in the Americas with those living in Britain during the 18th,  19th and 20th Centuries. In the concluding chapter Fryer continues to dwell  on the plight of contemporary black Britons rather than highlighting their  sucesses; no mention for instance of a growing and thriving black middle  class or increasing numbers in the higher professions. But these are really  incidental criticisms, since Fryer's book never fails to inform, educate  and even entertain the reader on the subject, and on that basis it must be  recommended.	2000-02-21

Buford does a fine job in  bridging that gap, and bares not a little of himself when revealing how  prone most of us can be to the thrill of being part of an out-of-control  group. Buford gets swept along with the thugs and clearly begins to enjoy  the sensation. What the author fails to capture is how great a part ritual  and stylization play in the violence. For as frightening as it is to  observe, football hooliganism has a long, long way to go before it reaches  the insanity of the literal street wars of America's gang culture with it's  ubiquitous fatal outcomes. I lend this book to Americans now, rather than  trying to describe football hooliganism. They love it.	2000-02-21

First class photographs (color and B/W) along with facinating written detail. Sadly this book quickly goes out of print  with each reprint. I wish the authour would expand his coverage to other  manufacturers of 1/32 scale slot cars... If he did, I would be first in  line to buy it. I also recommend and have reviewed (anon) &quot;Vintage  Slot Cars&quot; by Philippe de Lespinay.	2000-02-20

Barker draws strongly upon his experiences as a former preacher and devout christian. The only weak area of his otherwise compelling arguments is his inability to forcefully tackle the historic crimes against religious people perpetrated by atheistic communists.	1997-10-05
