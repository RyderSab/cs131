Fortunately, there are now far more and far better choices available.<br />It doesn't take long for the reader to realize that Welch regards Taoism and the Tao Te Ching with condescension and contempt. Aside from many factual errors, nearly every page yields some interpretation that is patently absurd.<br />Throughout the book Welch disdainfully references the fruits of Taoist meditation and self-cultivation as mere &quot;trance&quot;. I noted at least one instance where Welch left out the last lines of a translation from the Tao Te Ching to make his point stronger, but in so doing he totally distorted the meaning of the passage.<br />Welch's grasp of the most fundamental of Taoist terms and concepts is laughably childish and shallow. For instance, Part II, chapter 1 of this book is entitled &quot;Inaction&quot;--his translation of &quot;Wu Wei&quot;. Therein Welch constantly accuses Lao Tzu of passivity and pacifism. As a scholar, you'd think Welch would know that Taoist temples are filled with images of warrior dieties and that they display swords and other marital implements and regalia as symbols of the conflict inherent in society and nature. Some of China's greatest military strategists were, of course, Taoists and Taoist philosophy is the foundation of many of the Chinese martial arts. Wu Wei would be far more accurately translated as &quot;non-interference&quot;. Taoists are certainly aware that perhaps only in death is there &quot;inaction&quot;.<br />Curiously, for a general book about Taoism, Welch devotes almost all of his  attention to (mis)interpreting Lao Tzu and the Tao Te Ching. There is little discussion of other essential figures such as Chuang Tzu and Lieh Tzu. Welch fails to acknowledge the extent to which Taoist philopshy and sensibilities have influenced and permeated every aspect of Chinese life and culture.<br />Welch's most astonishing statements are to be found in Part Four, in the latter part of this book:<br />&quot;We [Americans]believe...that it is good to be vigorous, progressive, and forward looking, Lao Tzu believes it is good to be weak and to look inwards and  backwards. We believe that what America needs is dynamic, aggressive leadership. He prefers leadership that is listless and passive. We believe in keen competition. He believess in dull indifference. We believe in education. He considers it dangerous.&quot;<br />Welch therefore perfectly reflects the triumphalism, materialism, reductionism and positivism that permeated the zeitgeist of the 1950's. The world is a very different place now. Whatever the reason, Welch was unable to understand Taoism. It is unfortuante that he chose to write about a topic of which he had no useful understanding or insight and to thereby pass his ignorance  and bias on to his readers. It is unfortunate that his book is still in print to contribute further misunderstanding and distortion of Taoism and the Tao Te Ching.<br />Unfortunately, I have not encountered any book that provides a really good introdcutory overview  of Taoism.  Eva Wong's: The Shambhala Guide to Taoism has a good deal useful information. It unfortunately lacks a discussion of basic  Taoist concepts.<br />The Tao Te Ching continues to be published  in an astonishing number of  translations. Many of them are very poor translations. I've noted that many newer translations have a new age, politically correct flavor that may be stylish but is very inaccurate. A good and venerable translation is that of Lin Yutang and should be readily available inexpensively from used book dealers. The scholarly translation by Ellen Chen is useful but may be too daunting for the casaul reader.<br />Though not exhibiting any depth of scholarly knowledge, the books by John Blofeld are worthwhile as they contain a good deal of charming anecdotalmaterial from his experiences visiting Taoist monasteries before the communist revolution in China. Blofeld provides a delightful glimpse of a world that is tragically gone forever.<br />A brief monograph by Julius Evola entitled, Taoism-The Magic, The Mysticism, is worth acquiring. Evola is a metaphyscian and esotericist rather than an academic sinologist. His insights into Taoism in this very short work are excellent.tal material from his experiences visiting Taoist monasteries before the communist revolution in China.

There are far more useful books available today about learning chi gung.<br />Apart from a few interesting stories about specific chi gung masters there is very little value to be found in this book.	2004-04-01

Perhaps it is because he has a Ph.D. and quite a number of books published (largely recycling the same material). Maybe its because he has supplied them with effusive blurbs for their own books. Frankly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. <br />In my opinion, Fuerstein's writing style is ponderous yet is lacking in academic rigor. Nor do I find him to be ispiring or substantial in any practical sense. The question I ask myself is if he is not a good academic writer nor a good practical writer, why should I read him? I can't think of any reason!<br />One of his most irritating qualities to to present his marginal theories as if they are well accepted in authentic academic circles. Also, he cites some really insignificant writers as if they are renowned scholars, simply because they support his views. One author whom Fuerstein frequently cites has a dubious degree and is self-published. Fuerstein also cites as authoritative a book which he co-authored (a fact that is only mentioned in a foot note)that is academic junk and is published by a theosophical publisher!<br />On the plus side, this book is handsome and is well designed, with nice graphical images and photos throughout.<br />Yes, there is some interesting and valuable material contained in The Yoga Tradition. However, in my opinion getting to it is not worth the effort. There is far too much winnowing of chaff required. Still, if you want to impress your friends with the depth of your &quot;knowledge&quot;, leave this book lying around. It just may impress them.	2003-04-25

In an era when yoga has become trendy and commercialized it is refreshing that a mainstream publisher offers a book that advocates a return to spiritually oriented yoga practice. Ironically, the authors have created yet another &quot;brand name&quot; yoga while delivering a book that has more style than substance.<br />I was disappointed with most of the contents of this book. For example, the section on pranayama and bandhas has enough detail to get someone into trouble, but not enough detail to provide real guidance. The section on asana has some useful comments on sequencing, but the descriptions and the tiny, grainy, badly cropped photos are useless.<br />The text on various aspects of yoga philosophy and practice is uninspired and rather muddled. The section on ahimsa is particularly annoying, with a rather hectoring and judgmental attitude towards non-vegans.<br />I was especially disappointed with the recommended readings found in Appendix II. A book that is intended to inspire people towards a spiritual path should have a well organized reading list that describes the recommended books in some detail. The provided list has no organization at all, it isn't even properly alphabetized! Nor is there any description of the included books.<br />Surf on over to the Jivamukti website, there you can purchase some pricey yoga togs so that you can look very stylish on the road to spiritual liberation. The authors may have intended to promote a spiritual approach to yoga, but they've created yet another &quot;brand name&quot; yoga with themselves as &quot;yoga celebrities&quot;. If this sort of thing appeals to you, I suggest you check out their other book, The Art of Yoga, which is all style and no substance--but it sure is way cool.	2003-01-16

Frankly, time spent with these authors will serve one far better than time spent with Marty Glass. To find worthwhile insights herein, one has to put up with torrents of undisciplined, ponderous prose and cliched revelations. <br />One minor but considerable annoyance is the Index.

Fortunately, this book fills the void most admirably.  <br />While this is a serious book, it is readily accessible to the sincere inquirer.

Still, the work is so idiosyncratic and choppy that it will be of limited value for anyone seeking an introduction and overview of the teachings and insights offered by these diverse cultures.

I came across this volume in a used book store and my copy is copyrighted 1973. I can not speak to any revisions in any newer edition. <br />The author is given to writing books with polemical titles. Unfortunately, a catchy title is no substitute for quality analysis.<br />This book purports to be a critique of Christianity and Western civilization from the perspective of naturalistic American Indian spirituality. A great concept, poorly executed. Doubtless the author is sincere and intelligent, but he lacks the knowledge base from which to undertaken his ambitious task.<br />Despite his alleged theological training, the author draws his insights from more or less contemporary Protestant theologians. His knowledge of early Christian and Orthodox theology is apparently nonexistent.<br />The author delights in erecting strawmen, which he handily knocks down. Thus, he relentlessly critiques western civilization, while his &quot;take&quot; on Native American spirituality and culture is totally romanticised and utterly shallow. He lets lose with an occasional &quot;fact&quot; that reflects an astonishing ignorance of the subject. One minor example, the author states, &quot;Much of the misunderstanding of the place of the United States in the postwar worlds (sic) involves this tendency to reject the Russians because of their rejection of Christianity.&quot; I could devote paragraphs deconstructing the absurdity of this one sentence. Suffice it to say, the &quot;Russians&quot; did not reject Christianity. The Soviet regime murdered millions of Russian Christians because they dared to fail to &quot;reject Christianity&quot;. I could cite numerous such absurd statements made by the author.<br />I wish this book had been written by someone with more breadth and depth of knowledge. To be sure, the author's native intelligence (no pun intended) is such that he serves up some useful and sound insights, but his argumentation is weak. Indeed, it is clear the author had a conclusion and scared up some facts and analysis to fit that conclusion. Not the best way to tackle such a project!<br />Best read for amusement and nostalgia for the overheated counter-culturalism of the early 1970's. Not an intellectually serious book, despite its pretensions to the contrary.	2001-10-21

A collection of 44 mini-biographies of some of the most remarkable men (and a few women)of courage, honor and duty. The selection is eclectic: lawmen, outlaws, soldiers, fighter pilots, warriors and an assortment of others. Some are well known, some are obscure. Some are admirable for their virtue, others are scoundrels. What they have in common is an unwillingness to take the easy way out when things got rough.<br />In an era when masculinity has become suspect and courage is seen as psychopathology, it is a fine thing to read about men who refused to surrender their honor for the illusion of safety. Men for whom the concept of duty was inviolable and for whom courage was central to their being.<br />The author knows how to tell a grand tale. He avoids the temptation to engage in melodrama or psychological interpretation. I had to ration myself to reading just a few chapters at a time, the temptation was to race through the book.<br />My only complaint is that this book should have been presented in a hardback edition. I know I will be rereading this book from time to time for years to come.<br />To be sure, this book will give great pleasure simply as remarkable tales of remarkable people. However, I believe this book would be useful in the character education of any young man or women. The fact that not all of the people included are &quot;nice guys&quot; adds a depth that can be used to fully explore the nature of such characteristics as honor, duty and courage.	2001-10-20

Yet, I still give it 4 stars!<br />This is an account of the author's pilgrimage to Japan to visit his sensei in the art of swordsmanship and to visit various places important to his sensei and to their school of swordsmanship. Thus, the book is a kind of travelog of various obscure villages, gravesites and temples. Doesn't sound too promising, does it? Yet, the author infuses this account of his travels and experiences with sufficient insight and wisdom to entertain and inform. Also, it gives a finely textured account of the Japanese heartland that few westerners ever get to experience. Yes, at times the author is a bit long-winded and meandering. <br />To fully appreciate this book, it would be helpful to read Autumn Lighting, the wonderful biographical account of his training in Japanese swordsmanship, begun in the American Midwest when he was an adolescent. There is much information in Autumn Lightning  about the traditions, history, and founders of the author's style of martial art that makes reading Persimmon Wind a much richer experience.	2001-10-18

But, as a starting point to those new to the subject, I would recommend The Norse Myths by Kevin Crossley-Holland, which is a wonderfully evocative account of the Northern pantheon.<br />Davidson's book is a fine overview of the subject from a more scholarly perspective. It is a book of modest scope and the author is conservative in her assertions. At times her diffidence is endearing, at others it is frustrating. Clearly, the book is a product of its time. Overall, it has withstood the test of time and I anticipate it will be used for decades to come.	2001-10-10

I have to suspect that a lot of people rated this book highly because they agree with his conclusions and point of view (atheism), while others rate it poorly because they disagree with him. I give it a low rating because I found it dull and uninspired.<br />I also bought the author's book, Pagans and Christians, and my casual perusal of that volume suggests that it is far more interesting. Perhaps because there he is telling a story that has far more inherent direction and focus.	2001-09-27

Anyone even remotely familiar with Jung's work would recognize that his beliefs evolved over time. That he did not instantly publicly proclaim them as they emerged from his mind is hardly surprising or sinister.<br />The author's assertion that Jung sought to make himself the high priest of some Aryan religion and that he saw himself as &quot;The Aryan Christ&quot; is absurd. To be sure, Jung was hardly an orthodox Christian and he and his followers saw their movement as something more than a mere clinical system. What is so sinister about that? After all, Freud was hardly an orthodox Jew and he and his followers saw their system as something more than an innovative system of psycho-therapy.<br />Whatever personal motives the author has for making a career out of trashing Jung, there is a market for this tripe because the academic and publishing establishment has a hatred for all manifestations of Germanic culture.<br />A large chunk of this books is a mean spirited, gossipy account of the lives of three of Jung's female analysands and analysts. The connection between these lives and the author's thesis about Jung is tenuous. These accounts are mere sensationalist padding for a very slight book.<br />The book contains some useful biographical material and the footnotes are of far greater value than the text. Apologies to Amazaon.com -- but don't waste your money on this book. Get it from the library or get a cheap used copy.	2001-09-17

I was captivated by both threads.<br />The anecdote that explains the title, Autumn Lightning, is evocative of the essence of this book. The book is suffused with a subtle melancholly. The author is well aware that his art is nothing more than a museum piece, without any practicality and receiving little appreciation. Yet it is pursued because it is excellent, beautiful and transformative. In that way it is far more &quot;real&quot; than the ugly, debased &quot;reality&quot; of the modern world.<br />This book will delight natural aristocrats who are at odds with the spirit of the age.	2001-09-09

However, for those interested in, but unfamiliar with, Evola should start with his magnum opus, Revolt Against the Modern World, to better understand his decidedly complex and unusual world view. This book is a poor choice for someone looking for an introduction to Buddhism or meditation. The subtitle: &quot;The Attainment of Self-Mastery According to the Earliest Buddhist Texts&quot; suggests that this is something of a practice manual--it certainly is not. Rather, the book purports to set forth the fundamental ascesis of early Buddhism before it degenerated into a religion of the masses. Whether he has succeeded, I leave to the judgment of scholars of Buddhism. I believe that advanced students of Buddhism (or other serious spiritual disciplines)who are unintimidated by dry, scholarly, intellectually demanding writing will find this work to be fascinating and useful. But, of necessity, this is a very small audience. Evola, the unabashed elitist and aristocrat, would not be disappointed to have a limited, but discerning audience.	2001-08-25

The retelling is lively, engaging and immensely entertaining. <br />The author's introduction is excellent in assisting the non-scholar reader to get their bearings. The text of the myths is left clean and uncluttered with foot notes. Following the myths is a section of commentary on each of them. This is the books weakest point, the commentary seems unaccountably flat, lacking in depth and breadth.

The author includes a useful bibliography for those who wish to deep deeper into the subject.<br />Again, this is the book I would recommend to anyone interested in exploring the nine worlds. It is most unfortunately that the norse myths are not as well known as the Greek myths.	2001-08-21

Evola is first and foremost a metaphysician. But unlike his mentor, Rene Guenon, he has the knack of making his metaphysics very real and very practical.<br />This book has forever changed the way I look at the world. Yet, it is a book that few will have interest in or be able to grasp. And that alone is sufficient proof to justify Evola's heroic pessimism. If you are of the tiny minority capable of genuine independent thought, then you may wish to risk encountering this work--it will be quite an adventure.	2001-08-11

The author is clearly not sympathetic to his subject's world view, yet he mostly refrains from editorializing. <br />Indeed, the presentation is so dry and lifeless, the reader never gets much of a sense of the Savitri Devi as a person. Also, the author does a rather mediocre job of presenting the necessary background on Hindu nationalism and Devi's contributions to that cause.<br />But the author deserves credit for tackling the biography of such a politically incorrect figure.	2001-06-21

The book would have been better if he simply stated his advice clearly and concisely.<br />His biggest failure is that he makes no mention of spirituality and religion as a factor in achieving a long life. The studies on this are conclusive, spirituality and religion  aids in achieving a long and fulfilled life. The author's makes a few sneering remarks about unnecessary &quot;metaphysics&quot;. Clearly he has let his personal anti-religious bias interfere with his work.<br />Despite the limitations, this books is a useful one if it gets people thinking and acting to achieve a long and productive life. To work out a specific personal game plan, look for more informative books on diet and exercise.	2001-06-06

Whether you are a serious musclehead or a fitness oriented strength trainer--if you do not have excellent form sooner or later you will have problems. This book is the only book that gives enough detail about the correct form of the fundamental strength training exercises. <br />If weight training is part of your fitness routine you must own this book and study it carefully.	2001-04-17
US	52971033	R3C7URHJDLZLD2	0967043069	416123917	The Homeschooling Revolution	Books	5	21	21	N	N	A great resource	This book is the best overview of the &quot;Homeschooling Revolution&quot; that I've seen. The author is a Ph.D social scientist and a homeschooling Mom. Her writing style is informal and friendly. <br />This book is not a &quot;how to&quot; book on homeschooling, it is a serious yet engaging look at the homeschooling movement. It has plenty of references to useful homeschooling resources.<br />The chapter titles tell you a lot about this book: Ch 1 - Homeschooling 101;  Ch 2 - The Movement- Yesterday and Today;  Ch 3 - Legal and Political Inroads;  Ch 4 - The Socialization Question;  Ch 5 - What About Academics;  Ch 6 - The Marketing of a Movement;  Ch 7 - The Print Media and Homeschooling;  Ch 8 - Growing Pains;  Ch 9 - Profiling Homeschoolers;  Ch 10 Conclusion;  Endnotes.<br />Again, it is a great intro to the the homeschooling movement for those new to homeschooling (and their family and friends!) Yet, as a veteran homeschooling father, I learned a great deal from this book. This book will help you see the &quot;big picture&quot; of the homeschooling revolution better than any other book I've encountered.	2001-04-09

The author favors high intensity, infrequent training for strength and periodic high intensity aerobic training. Yet he is nondogmatic and his analysis is fair and balanced.<br />The author's views on diet have modified and improved since Lean for Life. Indeed, that is the author's greatest asset--he is constantly learning and improving. That is is the ultimate message of this book--you must never stop challenging and improving yourself.<br />This book is both inspirational and useful. But, if you aren't already doing weight training, you will need to learn technique from another book, video or trainer--it is not covered here.	2001-03-28

This is a well crafted and engaging work, it should appeal to those who are not martial artists. Yet, the primary audience is likely to be those who practice some form of martial art.<br />Clearly, Mr. Lowry's thoughtful insights were derived from his life long pursuit of excellence using the vehicle of traditional Japanese martial arts. Thus, he strikes a rather aristocratic tone that is hardly in keeping with our equality and self-esteem obsessed culture of instant gratification and self-worship. In this area I applaud Mr. Lowry's willingness to go against the grain.<br />Unfortunately, Mr. Lowry also feels the need to take a number of swipes at those who practice nontraditional martial arts. His supercilious characterizations in this regard are shallow and stereotypical. Perhaps he forgets that once upon a time the traditional martial arts were new and innovative and pragmatic. One person's body of tradition is another person's rigor mortis. <br />Also, his nipponophile tendencies are a bit much. I believe his view of Japanese society and culture is overly romantic and unrealistic. Japan, like American society, is under profound assault by the forces of modernity, materialism and anti-culture.<br />But these points aside, there is much to savor in Moving Toward Stillness and it merits a wider audience than it is likely to achieve.	2001-03-08

When this book was published in 1992 the author was in his mid-50s, and as the many photos show, he is extraordinarily musular with a very low body fat percentage i.e. &quot;ripped&quot;.<br />The author recommends a three pronged approach to being &quot;Lean For Life&quot;, a low-fat, high complex carb diet, weight training, and aerobic exercise. His exercise regime is the fruit of years of experience and serious inquiry into the literature of exercise physiology. Though now, some researchers recommend more emphasis on strength training over aerobics to jump start a reduction in body fat. While his exercise routines are equipment specific, the author clearly indicates how the principles can be adapted to other exercise routines--best of all--they are very doable without becoming a gym rat.<br />The author's dietary recommendations are of the near vegetarian low-fat, high commplex carb persuasion and he cites Dean Ornish. There are lots of people who seem to have their good and bad choleserol ratios made worse by this diet. Many others simply cannot sustain such a diet for long. So, be cautious if strictly adopting this diet.<br />In fact, lots of people seem to do well using other diets. It is amazing how little hard data is available on the optimal diet, perhaps there is no one &quot;best&quot; diet. Individual differences may be critical. Nevertheless, the author has many tips and common sense suggestions that are excellent, even if you don't follow his specific dietary choices. I like the author's strong emphasis that &quot;dieting&quot; doesn't work in the long term, you must change your approach to eating and food. No quick fixes.<br />The author gives lots of attention to techniques for self-motivation to achieve life-long life-style changes--good stuff!<br />Even if you don't buy into the low-fat, high-carb diet, this book is an excellent resource for information and inspiration. Also, consideringthe amount and quality of the information therein, this book is also a real bargain--if you act on it.	2001-02-06

However, Neanerthin is not the best book to read if you are interested in this approach to nutrition. Protein Power by Drs. Michael and Mary Eades is a far superior book, their explanations of how the diet works and its relationship to common medical conditions are clear and compelling. Their clinical experience gives them a depth and breadth of experience that enhances their credibility. <br />I found Audette's arguments and explanations in Neanderthin to be rather muddled and unconvincing, more dogmatic than substantive. However, the book contains some useful material and the bibliography was informative.<br />At best, this book should be used as a supplement to Protein Power.	2001-01-30

A young couple I am casually acquainted with sang the praises of this book with almost religous fervour, so I ordered a copy. I was very disappointed.<br />I was certainly impressed with the author's obvious sincerity about his system of teaching hatha yoga. And he is clearly a skilled and inspiring teacher. In fact, I would be delighted to take his class if I lived near his school. But, study yoga from this book? No way.<br />Many of the poses he uses in his Beginning Yoga Class are traditionally considered quite advanced. I found his how-to descriptions for doing the poses to be unclear and hard to follow. The photos are generally of limited help, since they mostly depict the finished pose, when a sequence of photos is necessary. He does include an &quot;ideal&quot; and a &quot;reality&quot; description for each pose. Unfortunately, the idea was better than the execution. An inexperienced yoga student would have an extremely difficult time trying to figure out how to do these demanding poses from this book. <br />The author's presentation style combines charm with irritating bombast. Tucked away are some gem like insights. The most important, is that if you devote an hour and a half a day to yoga practice for two uninterrupted months you will make great progress. Oddly, few yoga books adequately emphasize the cummulative benefits of doing your yoga without interruption for several months.<br />Unfortunately, I do not believe that many people could pick up this book and stick to this program everyday for two months. I believe that a more traditional approach is much more likely to succeed -- start with simpler poses and move on to more advanced ones as you progress and practice every day.<br />I fear that a beginner would simply give up on this highly eccentric program and also give up on yoga. That would be a great pity, since there are good yoga books and videos available to those who can't find a yoga class near where they live.	2000-11-02

Contrary to one reviewer, the section on yoga philosophy is short and to the point. <br />The section on yoga teachers and styles can be very useful in helping to decide what yoga style you might wish to explore.<br />The section (the bulk of the book) on yoga postures is adequate but unexceptional. The descriptions are ok, but the photos are small and not especially clear. No variations are shown for advanced practicioners or for those with limited flexibility.<br />There is a brief description of yoga props, but no information on how to incorporate them into your practice.<br />The section on sample yoga routines is mediocre.<br />This book is best as an inexpensive supplement to a good yoga class or video tape. The best beginners yoga book I've seen is &quot;Yoga for Beginners&quot; by Mark Ansari and Liz Lark.	2000-10-17
US	52971033	R2J66QAV7VLMFU	0062736485	977887245	Yoga for Beginners	Books	5	196	196	N	N	The best I've seen!	I reviewed many yoga books before selecting this one. For starters, the binding is cleverly designed to allow you to keep it near your mat for a quick review of the posture.<br />The photos and descriptions of the postures are exceptionally clear. Variations on the postures are noted for those who have limited flexibility. The program of postures is well thought out and is excellent for beginners, and is rigorous enough for those who are serious about their practice.<br />One minor quibble--it would have been useful if the book contained information about the use of yoga props, such as straps, blocks and bolsters. <br />While yoga classes are great for learning different styles of yoga, and getting needed corrections and suggestions, I find this book to be the single best investment I have made in my yoga practice. Though I also use various yoga videos, this book is far superior to any of them.	2000-10-16

This usually means they don't want potential  customers actually looking at the content in the bookstore. Also, the back  cover prominently displays an internet site for the book. This Web site  links you to the authors' professional Web site.<br />In my opinion this book  is an overpriced infomercial for the authors' legal services.<br />The first  one-third of the book is devoted to stating the obvious, that personal  financial data is readily available for purchase and that our society is  highly litigious. Is there anyone out there who didn't realize this?<br />Most  of the rest of the book is devoted to an overly general discussion of  various legal entities for asset protection and privacy such as  corporations, family partnerships, limited liability companies, and trusts.  For those who are unfamiliar with these issues, the book provides an  adequate introduction to the topic. The book is 268 pages in length, but  the author squanders page after page on filler, fluff and padding.  Obviously, the authors want you to to go on to purchase their legal  services.<br />In my opinion, the authors' enthusiasm for the limited  liability company is a bit premature. This is a relatively new legal entity  and there is not a large body of case law--especially in the complex and  thorny area of asset protection. Also, there is no meaningful discussion of  the all important tax implications of the choice of an LLC over that of a S  or C corporation.<br />Despite the title, there is very little useful  discussion of privacy preservation devices and there is much more emphasis  on asset protection. The authors tend to overstate the protection afforded  by privacy trusts and to understate the level of inconvenience that can  result fromtheir use--and there is absolutely no discussion of the costs  of setting up and maintaining any of the plans they recommend.<br />I was  particularly dismayed by one of their case studies in which they set up a  privacy trust to hold title to the modest real estate and financial assets  of an elderly client. In such instances, I would tend to advise conveying  the residence to the person(s) she intends to bequeath the property to,  while retaining a life estate to protect her interests. This would be much  less expensive to set up and would have almost no maintenance costs, unlike  the privacy trust.<br />On the plus side, the authors do a good job of warning  people about offshore tax evasion schemes and other absurd internet  scams.<br />Also, the authors overstate the benefit of keeping a low financial  profile. Asset searches are quite expensive. A potential litigant who  believes you have hidden assets may simply file the suit and in discovery  (usually via an inexpensive interrogatory) will demand disclosure of all  your interests in corporations, trust, etc.) If you perjure yourself and  get caught--you're in big trouble. If you are not the big fish he thought  you were, the litigant will at least try and pick up some chump change--and  even the weakest of cases do have nuisance settlement value. Keeping a low  profile is a great idea, but it is no panacea. What the authors call  dangerous assets should be protected by some limited liability vehicle, but  the choice between a corp. and an LLC is often more driven by tax  implications than legal issues. Your first stop should be your accountant,  not your lawyer.<br />While this book has some good points, it unfortunately  seems to be intended to generate clients and legal fees for the  authors.<br />I only wish the authors had written the book the title  implies--a solid, detailed, practical manual on maximizing personal  privacy. I believe there is a good market for such a book. There are  already enough mediocre books on asset protection.	2000-06-23

It's an amusing, anecdotal story of their homesteading endeavors.<br />I found the Colfaxs' perseverance in the face of  often great adversity inspiring and admirable. On the other hand, I found  their martyr complex extremely tiresome. David Colfax was denied tenure at  a couple of colleges allegedly due to their heavy involvement in left-wing  causes. I find it perplexing why a man who espouses self-reliance believes  that he has a right to tenure--which is welfare for those with a PhD. and a  willingness to jump through the hoops.<br />Still, this is a fine, light  read--if you get the book at the library or in the bargain bin. It's  certainly not worth paying for a new copy.	2000-04-09
