I took this book everywhere I went trying to sneak in a few minutes to read it each hour.  It was hard to put down.  Once again there is a host of characters that Ms. Corsi Staub creatively ties together in the plot.  This is a good summer read.	2005-06-19

I liked that it wasn't your typical chick lit book.  I thought it was different with the romance and a hint of mystery thrown in.  Rachel and her friends had great chemistry.  I hope this author continues to write more about these characters.  Also I hope Red Dress Ink publishes more books like this one.	2005-05-29

I forgot about Claire and Cindy and when they would resurface along the storyline, I was like \\"oh yeah, you're part of the story too\\".  It was just about Lindsay, her trial, and trying to solve a 10 year old crime.  It was a true JP book:  short chapters, twists and turns in the plot, with an unexpected killer in the end.  I would definitely recommend it, especially if you've read the previous novels and are planning to continue reading the series.  I see some \\"paths\\" that could be explored in future novels.	2005-05-26

I was captured by just reading the book jacket.  I thought his idea of writing the book in reverse order was creative.  I was in a \\"rut\\" and have been looking for something different and this was what I had been looking for.  Just when you think you know what happened, you get another twist.  Definitely worth the read.  While reading this book, the theme that kept coming back to mind is do you know who you can REALLY trust?  This book is definitely ownership worthy.	2005-05-08

We often think about the one that got away and the choices we've made about dating.  This book answered these questions for Beau.  It was a really good book.  I was able to guess which Mike she picked (only by luck; nothing that the author gave away).  It's a easy, fun read.  Good way to spend a lazy Saturday afternoon.	2005-04-23

The back cover really grabbed my attention and I thought this is a funny way to cope with men.  The book starts out typical, but quickly turns into self-reflection for the main characters.  It's not your typical chick-lit book.  I also liked the author's writing style.  It was as though she was having a conversation with you.  I definitely will read more from her.	2005-03-26

I wish he wrote more about Nora's mom.... that would have added more to the plot and may be gave us more insight to why Nora killed her husbands.  And what was in the letter that she wrote to Nora???  And the part about the Tourist?  That was a little confusing.  I say check it out at your library.  But still at least read it.	2005-03-16

Afterburn is about not wasting time and concentrating on unimportant things in life.  It's about letting go of the drama and embracing all the positive life has to offer.  This was a good love story with important life lessons.  The ending was unexpected, but necessary for the author to make her point.  Enjoy this book.  Trust me, once you start you won't put it down.  I'm waiting for the sequel.	2005-02-20

All in all this was a good fun read.  Prudence and her friends make this a drama-filled search to finding a new wife for Reilly.

I remember, while reading, that her writing style is similar to MHC.  Both have a talent of including a host of characters in their books and somehow finding a way to tie all of them to the plot.  Since reading The Last to Know, I have read all of Ms. Staub's books.  Kiss Her Goodbye was a good read.  I didn't figure out the killer until the killer finally identified himself.  But all the clues where there and I kicked myself for not picking up on them sooner.  I've read several of her books under the name of Wendy Markham and I have to say I enjoy her suspence novels better.	2004-12-28

When The Big Bad Wolf ended, I knew Mr. Patterson's next book had to pick up where this one ended.  I immediately expected the next book to be his best one yet... it seemed that it had to be.  For a year I waited for London Bridges and went out to buy it the first day it came out.  Now after just finishing it, I truly have to say it wasn't his best.  The ending was more like \\"that's it??? After all that, this is how it ends?\\"  And I'm still not sure of the identity of the man Alex and Ned were chasing on the rooftop.  Towards the end, I just got confused.  However, I will say that I won't stop reading Mr. Patterson's books.  He still remains one of my favorite authors.  I'm waiting for his next women detectives novel to be published.	2004-11-29

At the beginning, I really noticed that I was forcing myself to read this book and thought of just putting it down and picking it up at a later date.  But, I stuck with it and it got much better.  I would have rated it 4 stars, but the grammar and the transitioning of sentences were poor and confusing.  Hopefully the editing in her next book is better.	2004-10-31

After reading Shopaholic Ties the Knot, I just knew the next book would be Shopaholic Has a Baby.  So I was surprised to learn it was Shopaholic and Sister.  Originally the plot sounded funny.... having a sister that doesn't like to shop.  But the actual plot was just average.  I'm really not sure what to say about this book.  It wasn't entirely bad, but wasn't entirely good either.  If you've read the other books in the series, I'd say just read this one bcuz Jess may appear again in the follow-up book.  However, please just check it out from the library. Or wait until it comes out in paperback.  Better yet, buy it in paperback from a used book store.	2004-10-24

I've been looking for something different to read when I ran across this book.  I thought it was good.  I wouldn't say it was laugh out loud funny, but there were some funny lines throughout the book.  I kinda see it as the \\"all-purpose\\" book.

In the beginning it was and somewhere in the middle, I began thinking it sounds familiar to the Shopaholic series.  It was ok.  I didn't laugh out loud.  The character didn't annoy me, however her best friend did.  I didn't think the other characters were developed enough.  At times I would forget they were a part of the story.  Somehow I managed to finish it and thought it wrapped itself up neatly at the end.  Definitely not my favorite from the Red Dress Ink line.	2004-10-03

Just when you'd think you knew what happened, he throw in another twist.  I'm glad I decided to pick this one up again.  (I guess I gave it a 2nd chance!  Ha!)

The characters were so well-developed that it seemed they came to life from the pages.  I thought the author giving the reader more insight about Darcy's and Rachel's friendship through flashbacks was creative.  It helped put the &quot;affair&quot; into perspective.  Definitely one of the best books I've read this summer.	2004-07-18
US	29065502	R1867PBCKX7SMJ	0312990065	606969829	Lucky Stars	Books	3	0	0	N	N	just ok	Having read Ms. Heller's Best Enemies and Name Dropping, I had high hopes for this book.  I like her style of writing:  romance/comedy/mystery all in one.  This book started off well, but somewhere in the middle I just got tired of Stacey's constant complaining about EVERYTHING!  Enough already!  I managed to keep reading and closer to the end, I got into it again.  I wouldn't buy it, check it out from the library.  It's worth reading if your a fan of the author.  This won't stop me from reading her other books.  Hopefully they will be better.	2004-07-11

Right up to the end I just knew who did it.  I was wrong.... Erica Spindler puts a nice twist at the end.  This is definitely a fast-paced read.	2004-07-05

Hmmm.... it's just not funny to me anymore.  The lines are old and the humor is just mundane.  I didn't see any attraction between Stephanie and Joe or Stephanie and Ranger.  This is the 10th installment and Stephanie still hasn't gotten the bounty hunter thing right?  May be it's time for a new job.  Or may be it's time for a new twist in the story.  Something needs to happen to bring this series back to life.  In the meantime, I'll just settle for reading the 11th book when it comes to paperback; if I'll read it at all.  I'm starting to wonder if I'm reading more out of obligation instead of pleasure.  May be the change for me is to start looking for another series to read.	2004-07-01

The ending was realistic, not the typical fairy tale ending.  Could there possibly be a 3rd book?  Let's hope so.	2004-06-30

I can't even begin to write about how bad this book is.  The story jumped (if you can call it a story) and the characters were annoying.  The one thing I was was grateful for was that I checked this out from the library.  Save your money and your time... don't read this one.	2004-06-26

The beginning of the book was really good and it was hard to put down.  Somewhere in the middle, I just lost interest in the story and my mind wandered as I read the pages.  I have mixed feelings about recommending this book.  If you have others that you are anxiously waiting to read, my suggestion would be read those first.  Then when you have nothing else to read, read this one.  It's not a suspense, thrill-ride book.<br />One thing I will give the author is her ability to write in four perspectives to tell the story.  I thought she did a great job of tailoring her writing styles to fit each  narrator.  At the beginning of each chapter, the author will let the reader know which character is speaking.  At times, I didn't have to read that; I was just able to tell through her writing techniques.	2004-06-13

No other book comes close to this one.  This is definitely my favorite book.  I'm glad that high school english classes introduced me to reading classics.  I don't think that I would've read this book if it were not assigned.  I liked how the book is told in Scout's perspective.  Both the book and the movie are great.  If you haven't read this, READ IT NOW!  This should be on everyone's reading list.	2004-06-06

Nothing that I would recommend.  This was worse.  I couldn't tolerate the main character.  I thought Matthew could do so much better.  Hopefully the other books in the series are much better.	2004-05-31

Each woman is pretending to have the life that would make the other jealous.  When the truth comes to light, both realize that friendship is what's most important.  True friendship is something that cannot be faked.  <br />Ms.  Heller did a creative job by telling the story in both point of views.  This is the second book that I have read by her.  I like how she throws just a hint of mystery into the romantic storyline.  This is an easy read.  Be preapred... when you open the book, you'll find yourself wanting to stop everything until you've read the last page.	2004-05-30

I ended up checking it out from the library a week later.  It sounded funny and it was an added bonus that it took place in DC.  It was just ok... at times I found my mind wandering and had to re-read pages.  I wouldn't say not to read it, but if there's another book that you're anxiously waiting to read, I would suggest you read that book first.	2004-05-23

Never one to read books like this, I decided may be this is what I've been looking for.  The book reminded me of Runaway Bride at the beginning, but soon took a turn to become more original.  Parts of the book seemed far-fetched, but overall I was not disappointed.  I plan to continue reading more of the Flipside books.	2004-05-13

I've never read a romance novel so I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to explore this genre.  I've read this author under the name of Wendy Corsi Staub and loved each book.  This book did not disappoint me.  <br />It's a romantic comedy about finding love when you least expect it.  While reading this book I could picture the characters in my head and have been trying to figure out which actors/actresses could play the parts.<br />If you're looking for a light, fast read, this is the book for  you.	2004-04-29

After Marcel and Ian spent their time together, the author made a huge mistake with the details of the story, which just ruined the book for me.  I just lost interest.  I didn't feel that she concluded the storyline of the attempted buyout of Marcel's magazine.  Will there be a sequel?  Just too many loose ends.	2004-04-04

I picked this book up at the library and I'm glad that I did.  This is book with lots of twists and turns.  I just couldn't figure out the ending (which is a good thing!).  There's also a psychological theme to the book as well.  Read it and I don't think you'll be disappointed.	2003-10-14

It's fast reading with short chapters.  The plot twists and turns and you won't believe who the killer is.	2003-08-31

Stephanie still cracks me up with all the drama that comes her way.  The only problem I had with the book was the author constantly repeating old facts.  I figure if you're a true Plum fan, you will remember all the details.  I thought it took away from the storyline instead of adding to it.  But if you're anxiously waiting to read the next installment of Stephanie Plum, I do recommend this book.  You won't be disappointed.	2003-08-12

This book was much more than that.  It was about how a woman feels when everyone else is dating except for her.  When she is proud of her accomplishments, but can easily discount her feelings when someone asks that dreaded question: \\"so are you dating anyone?\\" If you have felt this way and can relate, then I recommend you reading this book.  I'm sure all women have felt the way Jane felt after losing significant people in your lives and trying to protect yourself at all costs.	2003-07-06
