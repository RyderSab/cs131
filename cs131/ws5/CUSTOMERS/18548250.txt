The letter contains a thousand dollars in cash and instructions: get a passport, book a one-way flight to London, then go to an address in New York to pick up a package before heading to the airport. Aunt Peg also lists specific rules: Take only what fits in a backpack. Leave credit cards, money, camera, cell phone, and laptop at home, and have no contact by electronic means from Europe with anyone in America. It seems unbelievable that Ginny would agree to these terms, but she does and is soon on her way to London with the New York package that contains twelve more letters of instruction. <br /> <br />Letter #2, which she is told to open on the plane, sends her to a flat in London where a man named Richard seems to be expecting her. Richard's answer to Peg's riddle \\"What did you sell the queen?\\" provides the password to an ATM account for Ginny that will fund her many adventures. Letter #3 instructs Ginny to give a charitable donation to an artist. After a few false starts Ginny stumbles upon a strange little play entitled \\"Starbucks: The Musical\\" and buys all the tickets to every performance. She becomes involved with the play's strange producer/director/star, Keith, who accompanies her to Edinburgh, Scotland where Letter #4 sends her. The next two envelopes guide Ginny on to Rome to statues of the vestal virgins. <br /> <br />Ginny is adopted by a noisy, over-organized American family touring Holland and spends five days with them. Her backpack and everything she owns, except her passport and ATM card, are stolen in Greece. Sometimes Ginny runs into dead ends as she tries to follow the instructions in the letters. She often gets lost and has to retrace her steps. At times she is tired, dirty and homesick; that's when she curses the letters and even Aunt Peg. Still, Ginny continues on her amazing journey, propelled by the letters, to a surprising conclusion. <br /> <br />13 LITTLE BLUE ENVELOPES is a very interesting book, full of realistic details of faraway places. Anyone who has the soul of an adventurer or is an armchair traveler will be swept away on a grand adventure in Europe with Ginny. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Carole Turner	2005-09-23

The series left off with Danica being pregnant, but FALCONDANCE is not about Oliza, their child and heir. Rather, it focuses on Nicias, a falcon who is one of Oliza's sworn guards. <br /> <br />Falcons are not looked upon favorably in Wyvern's Court, and when Nicias begins to experience falcon magic, he knows he must go back to the land of his ancestors to understand these strange new powers. What he learns there is that he does indeed have power and is considered of royal blood. This fact is both powerful and dangerous in the falcon world and back at home in Wyvern. <br /> <br />Terrible things are in his history that forever have been wiped from the memories of his parents, exiles living in Wyvern. But once he knows the truth about where he comes from, he sees that the future of Wyvern's Court and Oliza are in danger unless he acts to ensure otherwise. <br /> <br />Nicias brings a troubled woman back from Ahnmik, the falcon land, who is related to the serpiente. She could be a threat to Oliza but needed to go to Wyvern to survive.  Her actions, and Nicias's, likely will be spelled out further in the next volume.    <br /> <br />Beautifully described settings and Nicias himself will draw readers into this complicated and darkly suspenseful story.

Holly has a new project, which is to find her pal Britta a boyfriend so that Britta realizes there is more to life than just school. Madison is still dating her artist boyfriend, Stephen, while continuing to moon over Sean in a subtle manner. And Lina still has a serious crush on her teacher, Dan.    All three girls seem to mature as the book progresses, which makes them better people and more likable characters. Britta can be a bit annoying at times, but this can be chalked up to her isolated existence; she now is beginning a serious relationship with a foreign boy and contemplating elopement. Holly's older sister invites Holly and her friends to spend a weekend at college with her, giving the girls a sneak peak at what life after high school might be like. Madison's mother has written an autobiographical play that is being produced, and she wants Madison and her younger sister to portray her in it. Madison is not thrilled, to say the least. Lina hopes to start something with Dan at a party, but begins to realize that perhaps he is not the best choice for a teenage girl.

Even Noah admits, \\"Dad just has to work on his self control.\\" <br /> <br />Dusty Muleman, owner of the casino ship the Coral Queen, is not being very good to the environment (or so Mr. Underwood says).

The rest of the world sees them as a unit, boy-girl-boy. They have always dreamed of moving to California after high school, coming up with elaborate plans about where they will live, what car they will drive, and what jobs they will work. With high school ending and the possibilities of adult life appearing on the horizon, each begins to wonder who they are when they are apart, or how to tell the others of their secret talents and ambitions that don't fit with the group plan. <br /> <br />Larry is gay and still coming to terms with his sexuality. His friends accept his sexuality, but he's not sure he can introduce his new lover to them. Teresa is athletic, always running from the things that frighten her, and frustrated that the two most important men in her life don't appreciate her romantically. Elliot is a basketball star who secretly feels much smarter and happier when he spends time away from his two best friends. <br /> <br />Each of the characters has some difficult aspect relating to their proper families. Larry's mother is a medium. Elliot's parents are extremely religious. Teresa's mother abandoned her with her abusive father. There is a sense that they turn to one another for support. The insularity of their friendship protects them from those things that might harm them, but it also prevents them from growing in the outside world. <br /> <br />BOY GIRL BOY divides the narration among each of the characters, rotating between each voice. The exploration of the friendship is insightful, effectively capturing the intensity of adolescent attachment, as well as the relief each character feels at finally getting room to breathe. However, it lacks some of the anguish that occurs as friendships end or change. The characters in this book are also particularly lucky that they are all ready to end one thing and begin another at the same time. Both Larry and Elliot have new relationships by the end of the book, while Teresa seems to be overcoming an eating disorder and starts tutoring. <br /> <br />Ron Koertge, author of numerous books for young adults, has a reputation for writing about unusual relationships between young people without relying on stereotypes or contrived endings. His book STONER & SPAZ about the friendship between a wild party girl and a boy with cerebral palsy is convincing, moving and realistic. BOY GIRL BOY doesn't have the same narrative or emotional punch, but is in many ways more optimistic. The book reads like a reassuring fable, promising that the inevitability of change doesn't always have to mean the end of all previous dreams and friendships. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Sarah A.

Intimidated by social situations and bored by learning traditional academic subjects, Thirrin's only passions are her studies of great military campaigns, her phenomenal skill at axe-throwing competitions, and her lust for battle. <br /> <br />When Thirrin encounters Grishmak, the king of the werewolves, and spares his life, she gains the loyalty of Grishmak's \\"people,\\" who live in the fearsome Land of the Ghosts. As outside invaders threaten their small land, Thirrin urges King Redrought to form more alliances with the inhabitants of the Land of the Ghosts. Her father brushes Thirrin off, but when he dies in battle, it's up to Thirrin to foster allegiances and lead her unlikely army against the daunting enemy with a cry of \\"Blood! Blast! And Fire!\\" <br /> <br />Debut novelist Stuart Hill's THE CRY OF THE ICEMARK is a hefty volume, the first in a projected trilogy. Thirrin is an appealing character, as is her companion Oskan, the witch's son. Hill draws freely from any number of traditional and mythological stories to people his narrative: the text is populated with werewolves, witches and vampires. The Icemark itself bears a resemblance to old Norse kingdoms (King Redrought is taken to Valhalla), and the invading masses (who speak Latin and are led by Scipio Bellorum) seem suspiciously like the Roman Empire. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Hill's writing style is a little too flat and explanatory, relying on exclamation marks rather than effective prose to convey emotion. The characters, particularly the secondary ones, also are somewhat flat, reduced to one or two defining characteristics (King Redrought, for example, is fearsome in battle but wears fuzzy slippers and dotes on a kitten) rather than being more fully and complexly drawn.  <br /> <br />Nevertheless, fans ofaction-filled, fast-paced adventure stories, particularly those who enjoy battle scenes, will find much to appreciate in THE CRY OF THE ICEMARK. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl	2005-09-22

She will earn her driver's license, graduate high school and go on to college, her first love, marriage and a fulfilling career as a veterinarian. But on the way to help her best friend shop for a prom dress, Liz is killed by a hit-and-run driver. End of story? Not even close. <br /> <br />In Gabrielle Zevin's witty and wise new novel, ELSEWHERE, Liz awakens on a cruise ship bound for the afterlife. When the ship docks, she meets her grandmother Betty, who died before Liz was born. Betty looks, to Liz's surprise, only about as old (or young) as Liz's mother. The explanation: Residents of Elsewhere age backward until infancy, when they are \\"released,\\" or sent back downriver to be reborn on Earth. <br /> <br />From this deceptively simple concept, Zevin creates a compelling, fully realized world, and in Liz, she has a believable, sympathetic main character. At first, Liz feels cheated out of her life, and who wouldn't? \\"If it isn't bad enough that she died before getting to do anything fun,\\" Liz thinks upon learning her fate, \\"now she will have to repeat her whole life in reverse until she becomes a stupid, sniveling baby again.\\" She spends hours behind the coin-operated binoculars at one of Elsewhere's Observation Decks, sullenly keeping tabs on the friends and family she left behind. <br /> <br />ELSEWHERE would be a gloomy read if Liz never moved beyond her grief, but fortunately Zevin doesn't let her wallow for too long. Every Elsewhere resident is encouraged to choose a profession, and Liz takes a counseling position with the Division of Domestic Animals: she explains the basics of Elsewhere to recently deceased dogs and places them in new homes. You'll need to read the book to learn exactly how humans in Elsewhere are able to communicate with canines, but dogs provide much of the novel's comic relief. Sadie, a newly arrived mutt, is disgusted when Liz discloses the difference between a water dish and a toilet bowl. \\"Why didn't anyone ever tell me?\\" the dog asks, horrified. \\"I've been drinking from toilets for years. I never knew. They always had the door closed.\\" <br /> <br />Just as Liz's pet counseling work in Elsewhere is a twist on her former life's ambition, so too does she realize her other goals: she eventually earns her license and even falls in love. Things don't work out exactly the way she had expected, but then, people's lives usually don't. The beauty of ELSEWHERE lies in the way it holds up a mirror to our own world. \\"You get older, you get younger,\\" Liz muses toward the novel's end, \\"and I'm not sure the difference is as great as I once thought.\\" <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Carolyn Juris	2005-09-22

As a result of Gemma's recent actions, the magic of the Realms is now loose and wreaking havoc. So Gemma must find the elusive Temple and bind the magic, thus restoring order to the Realms. But with free power comes power-hungry people, and everyone from Kartik's secret organization Rakshana to Gemma's disguised enemy Circe is desperate to gain control of the power before Gemma can bind it. Once again Gemma must decide whom she can trust and who would rather see her and her friends destroyed in the name of power. And she must do all this while navigating the almost-as-dangerous terrain of London's high society. <br /> <br />As in her previous book, Libba Bray adds depth to this supernatural story with Gemma's insights into the plight of women in Victorian England. The choice for them is harsh: be married off by their families to the first appropriate suitor, or suffer a life as a lonely spinster, teaching in a school like Spence Academy. The girls' feelings of powerlessness and dependency fuel this story where people will go to any length to achieve their own personal sense of power. <br /> <br />Like its predecessor, REBEL ANGELS is an intelligent page-turner that keeps the reader guessing about secret identities, prophecies and risky alliances.

Most of the time he doesn't think (too much) about his weight problem, his lack of popularity, or his dead father. <br /> <br />When Elvin's Uncle Alex shows up, calling his visit \\"unexpected\\" would be an understatement. Elvin had always been told that his dad's brother died in a plane crash, but it turns out that Alex had just gone missing after stealing and gambling away all of the money Elvin's dad left his family after his death. Now Alex is back in town, seeking redemption from his nephew. <br /> <br />For Alex, redemption means turning Elvin's life around, taking him to the gym, cooking him healthy (and outrageously spicy) foods, and advising him to form a rock band. For Elvin, Alex's sudden appearance is confusing but not entirely unwelcome; after years of believing that he had no blood relatives on his father's side, Elvin sees his uncle as a link to his dad. <br /> <br />Fans of Chris Lynch's earlier books about Elvin will recognize Elvin's sarcasm and particularly wry sense of humor, often directed at his own weaknesses. Although ME, DEAD DAD, & ALCATRAZ can stand alone, readers meeting Elvin for the first time might have difficulties getting into his head.

But as the queen-to-be, Rain is raised with many guiding hands as she learns every aspect of their all-female tribe, including beekeeping, archery, and Rain's favorite --- the horses. <br /> <br />Horses are an important aspect of their tribe, and Rain devotes herself to becoming the tribe's best horsewoman.

Roran does not realize that Eragon has left the valley to protect his family and friends from the Galbatorix. He only knows that if Eragon had not kept the strange stone (which was a dragon egg) a secret, perhaps things would now be different. After Garrow's death, Roran returns to the village of Carvahall where he hopes to court the beautiful Katrina and eventually ask for her hand in marriage. However, he no longer has a home or farm (thanks to Eragon) and he needs to build his fortune to win the approval of Sloan, Katrina's father. <br /> <br />Beforeany of this can happen Roran discovers that the Galbatorix, represented by horrible creatures known as Ra'zac, are after him --- simply because he is associated with Eragon. As the situation becomes more intense, Roran attempts to hide away from the village, but within a short time the village is under siege and the dreaded Ra'zac take Katrina captive. Here begins the true journey for Roran, as he leads the villagers away and begins a frightening, most dangerous adventure to find both safety for them and a way to get Katrina back. <br /> <br />Paolini skillfully weaves the stories of Eragon and Roran back and forth --- creating countless other fascinating characters on all sides. There are even suggestions of romance when Eragon becomes infatuated with Ayra, the elfin princess he rescued, and for Saphira, the only female dragon around, when she is attracted to her mentor, the great dragon Glaedr. <br /> <br />There are also spots of humor, and in one scene especially the often-quoted lines from the film Treasure of the Sierre Madre are played on when Loring, the cobbler, is protesting the use of barges for the villagers to make their escape: <br /> <br />\\"Barges?\\" said the cobbler. \\"Barges? We don't want no stinking barges!\\" <br /> <br />The panoramic battles at the end include one of the most exciting moments as Saphira fights a giant red dragon over a bloody battlefield. The battle is vividly realized as Paolini paints a scene that is sure to be a favorite. The identity of Eragon's father is also uncovered during a dual that echoes the power and themes of STAR WARS. <br /> <br />Using blended ancient Nordic languages is affective in the dialogues of this myth-like world, and an excellent language guide is provided at the end of the book. Wizards, monsters, dragons, elves, dwarves, magic forests, witches, storytellers, enchanted swords and powerful spells all combine to make ELDEST a sure winner for fantasy fans. There is no question that Paolini is paying tributeto writers like Tolkien, L'Engle and McCaffrey. His writing is filled with quests, heroes, magic and mysticism. A screen adaptation of these books, as well as book three in the trilogy, are in the making. For old and new fans, all of this cannot happen soon enough! <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Sally M.

Her little brother, more hers than either of her parents', was sent to live with her aunt and uncle. Now, her mother drinks too much and doesn't go to work when she says she will. Zoe, straining from the effort of keeping the household together and waitressing to make ends meet, acts out in class. She realizes, though the decision is anything but easy, that she must have a room of her own if she wants to regain control of her life. <br /> <br />The answer to her needs comes in the form of a room at 373 Lorelei Street. Opal Keats, in order to make ends meet and pay her taxes, rents a room to Zoe. In Opal, Zoe finds an ally, someone who has seen much of the past but always looks to the future. Zoe swears she'll never return to her mother's house and the life she left. But when expenses are high and her only income comes from waitressing at a diner, she knows she might have to go to an extreme or two in order to keep her room. <br /> <br />With strength, resolve, and a little help from an old woman with a big dog, Zoe tackles her problems one by one. Even though there are no happy endings, Zoe is able to overcome her family's troubles as well as her own, and the reader can feel all of her frustration, love, sadness and determination. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Carlie Webber	2005-08-11

Even Sandpiper's younger sister Daisy knows that kids at the high school call her older sister a slut. Sandpiper has figured out that giving oral sex to guys can get her some much-needed attention and a sort of power. The only problem is that she doesn't even like the guys she \\"dates,\\" and she's more than willing to dump them after a few days or weeks. That kind of approach doesn't fly with her most recent boyfriend, Derek, who thinks that Sandpiper owes him --- and his friends --- even more. <br /> <br />Sandpiper certainly can't talk to her parents about Derek's threats or about the reasons for her self-degrading sexual behavior. Her mom is getting remarried and can only think about plans for the upcoming lavish wedding. Her stepfather-to-be, Nathan, brings his daughter Rachel into town for the wedding. Rachel is everything Sandpiper isn't --- cute, petite, perky, the kind of girl who pleases parents and waits until marriage for sex. Sandpiper's father, Rags, has plenty of problems of his own --- he's a serial dater of younger women, and he doesn't know how to even look at Sandpiper now that she's developed breasts. <br /> <br />Then Sandpiper meets a mysterious loner simply called the Walker, because he walks incessantly around their small Massachusetts town, refusing to ride in cars even in the pouring rain. She doesn't know anything about Walker's past, not even his real name (at first); all she knows is that he offers her platonic friendship without any sexual demands. When Derek starts to act on his threats, Walker and Sandpiper must come clean about their pasts so that they can help each other and find a new, more genuine kind of relationship. <br /> <br />Sandpiper's own narration of her story alternates with her autobiographical poetry, often written in the style of famous poems (\\"The Love Song of Piper H. Ragsdale,\\" for example). Surprisingly, the novel doesn't offer Piper's poetic gifts as healthier opportunities for her to increase her own self-worth, instead focusing on family and genuine romantic relationships as the best solutions. Both the characters of Derek and Walker are taken to extremes; Derek is a one-dimensional thug, and Walker is a little too wise and philosophical for his years. Piper herself, though, is a complex, sympathetic (if not always entirely likeable) character. <br /> <br />Ellen Wittlinger's novels for teens don't shy away from tough subjects. In SANDPIPER Wittlinger explores the current widespread belief that oral sex is not \\"real sex.\\" The novel's subject matter and its weighty tone make it appropriate for older teens. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl	2005-08-11

Elijah is the dreamy brother, who loves to hang out with his friends at boarding school and has endless conversations with strangers. Danny is the elder brother --- hardworking, serious, and completely devoted to his first job in advertising. Elijah thinks of Danny as being a sellout, a phony, and a liar. Danny thinks of Elijah as being a penniless, pothead fallback, with no sense of reality. Both brothers have forgotten the affection they once had for each other.<br /><br />In an attempt to get the two siblings to communicate again, their parents send them on a tour of Italy. An impressionistic blend of novel, travelogue and poetry, ARE WE THERE YET? is about the brothers' travels through Venice, Florence and Rome. Travel, particularly in a foreign country, has a disorienting quality that makes things seem simultaneously immediate and very faraway. David Levithan captures this paradox, as well as the strange coincidences and people the two brothers encounter along the way. He covers the major sites of each city, along with minor sites important to each character.<br /><br />Notably, Levithan writes about the remnants of once-thriving Jewish communities in each city. When the brothers visit the infamous Jewish ghetto in Venice, immortalized by Shakespeare's Shylock, they read that 8,000 Italian Jews were sent to concentration camps during the Holocaust. Only eight returned. Later, a guide notes that the Venetian Jewish community now numbers about 600 in a city of approximately 63,000. Doubly an outsider, as an American-Jew in an Italian city filled with some of the most famous Christian artwork in the world, Danny starts to question his place in the world, and a system of values that has left him largely alone.<br /><br />When he and Elijah fight about a woman Elijah meets at the scene of an accident, the brothers separate, leaving them both truly alone in a foreign country. Slowly each comes to realize that despite the pleasures and autonomy of being alone, \\"it's good to share a life.\\" Elijah realizes that he isolates himself through casual relationships and does not express his feelings for the people he truly loves. Danny sees that his work has come between him and the people who love him most. The brothers reunite in Rome. They share a serendipitous sunrise at the Parthenon, followed by a tour of all the sites in the movie Roman Holiday, which they are surprised to discover they both love.<br /><br />In a conversation between Danny and one of his childhood friends, Levithan touches on the difficulty of being brothers, when the process of growing up interferes with the bond they once shared:<br /><br />\\"Brothers are not like sisters. They don't call each other every week. Will you be there for him if he needs you? Of course. Should you love him without question? Absolutely. But those are the easy things. Do you make him a large part of your life, an equal to a wife or a best friend? At the beginning, when you're kids, the answer is often yes. But when you get to high school, or older? Do you tell him everything? Do you let him know who you really are? The answer is usually no.\\"<br /><br />ARE WE THERE YET? not only explores the dynamic of accumulating distance between brothers, but also looks at the way Danny and Elijah begin to close the gap as they gain maturity. The optimism that is part of Levithan's other novels saturates this book, offering the following advice for relationships: \\"Don't go for normal. Go for happy. Go for what you want it to be instead of settling for what is.\\"<br /><br />  --- Reviewed by Sarah A. Wood	2005-08-11

He has already graduated from high school, and two of his good friends have already joined the U.S. Army. Despite the fact that Eddy's father is still fiercely loyal to Japan (a portrait of the emperor graces their foyer), Eddy knows he's an American through and through. As World War II grows ever closer to American shores, Eddie fudges his birth certificate so that he can join the military too. <br /> <br />At first, Eddy's father is deeply disappointed that Eddy has turned his back on Japan to join the American military. But when the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor, everything changes. Soon Eddy's father begins to respect Eddy's loyalty to their new country. <br /> <br />Life in the military is not easy for Eddy and his friends. All Americans of Japanese descent, even those in the military, are under suspicion. Eddy's friend Cobra says, \\"To them we all look like Hirohito. They see us, they see the guys in those planes dropping bombs on them. We got the eyes of the Emperor. They scared of us.

Branson, a braggart and a bully, decides to break into the empty frat house, and he talks the team into joining him.

The boys basically strip the house of anything valuable that can later be sold, and Nate helps load the van. Only one player, Jackson, walks away in disgust, wanting nothing to do with the robbery. <br /> <br />Because Nate's older brother Marvin, no stranger to the local police, lives near the frat house, he becomes a suspect in the robbery.

When questioned by school authorities, to a man, the team denies any involvement in the robbery. <br /> <br />Still, the pressure is really on. Nate's parents are suspicious. Lorrie, Nate's girlfriend, begs him to remain silent about the robbery, but Nate's conscience is bothering him. He and Jackson are good friends.

Marvin tries to keep the police at bay while encouraging Nate to come forward with the truth and deal with whatever happens. <br /> <br />Nate is very confused and frightened. If he confesses he will be in big trouble at home, at school, and with Lorrie. He knows his confession will implicate the team and that the team will turn on him.

A wide and interesting array of subjects and settings provides fantasy readers with a good read. ACROSS THE WALL is a collection of the author's previously published short stories. However, it opens with \\"Nicholas Sayre and the Creature in the Case,\\" a novella Nix wrote out of \\"the desire to see what happened next\\" to character Nicholas Sayre from The Abhorsen Trilogy.    Throughout the book, Nix is candid with readers about facts that went into the production of each short story. Information about his writing techniques and practices also are sprinkled among the pages. Readers who already appreciate Nix's fantasy adventure stories will enjoy the snippets as they add interesting background to each story. As a writer, I found it intriguing to follow Nix's patterns of note taking, ideas, and outlining so much that I chose to visit his website where I found even more details on how he creates his work.    Nix claims to be \\"someone who doesn't like the Arthurian mythos,\\" but provides readers two stories written from his fantastical perspective of King Arthur and surrounding characters, primarily Merlin. \\"Under the Lake\\" explores Arthurianna from the eyes and mind of The Lady of the Lake. \\"Heart's Desire\\" retells the story of Merlin and Nimue \\"in a different light.\\" Both present a sort of History Camelot and both clamor with the empty sounds of choosing power over love.    A dry wit permeates \\"From the Lighthouse\\" as Nix portrays a larger than life millionaire madman who thinks he has bought an island to assuage his entrepreneurial desires. The natives are pleasant until it is discovered how Marcus Kilman intends to change their lives with new industry and wealthy citizens looking for a travel adventure. Greed colors everything Kilman thinks and says. Nix is clever in his commentary on contemporary efforts to cultivate vacation lands out of quiet, pristine islands that would be better off left undiscovered.    For the busy days of summer, ACROSS THE WALL is the perfect book for Nix fans old and new to keep by the bed and read a story or two at a time.

A hot teen movie star gets transformed into a gerbil. A boy tickles his girlfriend until she explodes. A pirate captain becomes violently seasick. These are just some of the scenarios in Barry Yourgrau's NASTYbook, a collection of gruesome and grotesque stories intended to disgust and delight young readers. <br /> <br />My first mistake in reading NASTYbook was to be fooled by the cover, which is put on backwards, so readers looks like they are reading the book upside down. My second mistake was thinking that it wouldn't actually be as nasty as the title suggests. Do not underestimate the nastiness of this book. Along with normal gross-out nose-picking and bodily fluids, NASTYbook contains all sorts of bad behavior, including decapitations, animal rampages, and revenge from beyond the grave. <br /> <br />The stories in NASTYbook are short, usually just a few pages long, and extremely effective. One type is a fable with the ironic punch of Kafka, like \\"Peanut Shells,\\" about an elephant who's caught cheating on a test with notes it cannot in fact read, or \\"Ugly,\\" a story about a boy with bad skin who becomes the monster he feels himself to be. Other stories have the tone of Hilaire Belloc's CAUTIONARY TALES FOR CHILDREN, about juveniles whose bad behavior is rewarded with bad ends. Still others are just plain grotesque, or unnervingly scary, like \\"Oof Oof\\" about the ghost of a teddy bear who comes back to haunt its tormentors. The collection is visceral and disturbing, and exactly the sort of thing many kids would enjoy reading, even as many parents would find it inappropriate or upsetting. <br /> <br />Yourgrau's work, whether for children or adults, is at its best when he writes lean stories ripped with vivid imagery. His work is like a window into other people's nightmares. Even though they are clearly prose, there is something poetic about even the nastiest stories in NASTYbook. Yourgrau's work reminds me of Shel Silverstein's. It has the same awareness that childhood isn't just sweetness and innocence, but also can be filled with fear, superstition and brutality. <br /> <br />NASTYbook is fun to read and truly distressing, a book that will convince many young people that reading is more exciting than they previously thought. It does not seek any kind of moral or artistic redemption, but may find it anyway. NASTYbook is likely to be on the banned books list for many years to come. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Sarah A.

She also meets King Harry, a brazen, magical cat, who updates Gwenore of her allies and the enemies she left behind in Wales as well as hints of her true self.    Two years go by, and Gwenore's life --- and her appearance --- has changed. She is now working as Margarite's apprentice and has developed her skills as a musician. Things seem to be going well, until a courageous friend named Tom arrives in Blessingwood with news of her mother and an evil physician rival accusing Margarite of witchcraft. Gwenore and her friends flee to Ireland, but Gwenore ends up on the Island of Lir, where she must protect its kingdom from the evil witch and finally discover who she really is.    SINGER is a great story based on the classic Irish folktale \\"Children of the Lir.\\" It is a fast-paced, dramatic fantasy that readers will want to read to the very last page.       --- Reviewed by Sarah Sawtelle[...]	2005-08-11

He worries about everything: having to take a sex-ed class at school, trying out for the baseball team, determining whether Martha MacDowell is looking at him in a funny, pathetic kind of way or in an interested kind of way, and the gray hair sprouting out of his head. Toby is especially worried about his dad, who left the family after losing his job at the factory. He hasn't heard from him in so long that he's beginning to think he might never return. <br /> <br />And if that isn't enough to deal with, there's Toby's older brother Jake, who is getting into serious trouble with drugs. Unlike Toby's dad, Jake does come home, but at very late hours and is stoned. He doesn't seem to care about the things that he used to care about, like being a star player on his baseball team. And he's hanging out with the local drug dealer --- and starting to steal. <br /> <br />Toby feels that his mom has enough to worry about (like the unpaid bills), so he is taking it upon himself to clean up after Jake's messes, to come up with excuses for why he's late and why he's sick. He finds a bit of solace in looking at his prized baseball card, the one he wishes he could show his dad, but Toby isn't sure how much longer he can cover for his brother. And just maybe this load is a little to heavy for Toby's shoulders to carry alone. <br /> <br />Talented author Patricia McCormick does a superb job in telling Toby's tale. She approaches this serious subject matter honestly and believably, easing through it with humorous side stories and a fast-moving plot.

Confused and sleepless, she heads out for a midnight walk on a brutally cold Minnesota winter night. As she sits by the lake feeling sorry for herself, she witnesses what she later realizes is the lead-up to a deadly accident, a tragedy she's convinced she could have prevented. <br /> <br />As artistic Hanna revisits the scene of the accident to sketch out her feelings, she notices another solitary visitor to the site. Soon she discovers that another person, Will, is hiding his own secret about that terrible night. United by their role in the tragedy, Will and Hanna develop an immediate physical and emotional attraction. Soon, though, Hanna discovers that Will is hiding more about himself than she had expected. <br /> <br />Before Hanna realizes Will's secret, though, she's already gotten inextricably involved with his large, emotionally intense family. Hanna, who is an only child being raised by her widowed mother, is attracted by Will's passionate, close-knit family, especially by his older sister Aerin, who is recovering from her own tragedy. Hanna's exposure to this new kind of family inspires her to seek out the truth about her own family roots. <br /> <br />Marsha Qualey's novels for young adults always seem to avoid the kinds of clichd plots that can mar much fiction for teens. An examination of Hanna's guilt over the death of two teenagers could have deteriorated into a simplistic expose of survivor's guilt. Instead, though, Qualey delves into the complexities of Hanna's reactions; she explores the impact on Hanna's friendships, on her academic work, on her artistic expression, and on her close relationship with her mother. The weakest aspect of the novel is the brief \\"What Happens Next?\\" epilogue, which ties up plot ends a little too conveniently and simplistically for what is, in all other respects, a challenging and complex portrayal of an intelligent and complicated young woman. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl	2005-08-11

Although Rachel is raised in humble surroundings --- a mud brick house with a roof that leaks --- she is happy, helping her father in the hospital and visiting the local people in their shambas. When the influenza epidemic of 1919 reaches Tumaini, however, Rachel's whole life changes. Not only do the Africans flee the village out of fear of the illness, but her own parents are struck down by the disease. <br /> <br />Left without family, Rachel thinks her only option is to approach the mission board in Mombasa, although she knows they will send her to a dismal orphanage in England. Her snooty British neighbors have other ideas. Their only daughter Valerie, scheduled for a visit to England with her estranged --- and wealthy --- grandfather, also died in the flu epidemic. Valerie's parents want Rachel to take her place. \\"It is only the expectation of Valerie's visit that has kept the dear old man alive,\\" her mother claims. Rachel is astute enough to realize that there may be an underlying motive, but she's also frightened at the prospect of being trapped in the orphanage. With misgivings and a trembling heart, Rachel agrees to do as her neighbors ask, and sets off for England. <br /> <br />LISTENING FOR LIONS is written in a spare, elegant prose that will engage adults and children alike. What could have been a trite undercover identity plot is revealed in such depth and nuance that it never becomes melodramatic or overwhelming. However, Whelan's strength here is her characters, particularly Rachel. Although in some places Rachel seems almost too good to be true, her own self-doubt and recognition of her own weaknesses make her very believable. Whelan's slow, subtle and delightful development of the relationship between Rachel and Valerie's grandfather is masterful. While Rachel grows and changes in England in some unexpected and surprising ways, she never loses the core of that missionary child growing up in the African countryside. <br /> <br />Another thing that Whelan does extremely well is to create a sympathetic yet realistic Western character in a colonial environment. The world has changed tremendously since 1919, and behavior and attitudes that were normal at that time are often morally repugnant to us today. Most authors of historical novels deal with this by giving their main characters 21st century sensibilities, particularly on sensitive topics like women's issues and racial equality. While understandable, it has the effect of making the characters seem unreal. Whelan avoids this trap. Growing up under such unusual circumstances, Rachel's views on controversial topics seem natural, not just something tacked on to make the character more sympathetic. <br /> <br />LISTENING FOR LIONS is a fantastic book, filled with characters who will remain with you long after you've finished the last page. I heartily recommend it. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Paula Jolin	2005-08-11

Because they misjudge the ones they hate. Because they really don't know them.\\" <br /> <br />Author Ann Rinaldi has been writing historical fiction for over three decades and has gained quite a reputation for doing so. Her books have received their fair share of accolades, including the American Library Association Best Book of the Year Award (eight of her books have been awarded this honor), and have been used as part of the curriculum in countless schools and libraries nationwide. Her latest book, titled THE COLOR OF FIRE, is yet another strong addition to the bunch --- a fictional account based on the Great Negro Plot of 1741 in New York City when America was still a colony of Great Britain and at war with Spain. <br /> <br />The story opens just as a fire is beginning to catch in Master Philipse's warehouse, and Phoebe, Master Philipse's black servant and the eyes and ears of the book, is attempting to decipher who started it. As the days go on and more fires are mysteriously started, the townsfolk become increasingly suspicious and suspect that the slaves not only are responsible for the wreckage but that they also are planning a murderous revolt against their masters. A manhunt ensues, and as you might expect, blacks are pitted against whites, fingers are pointed, and blame gets handed down without a lick of fairness or in-depth investigation on the part of the authorities. <br /> <br />In the end, Phoebe's best friend Cuffee, also a servant to Master Philipse, is charged, put to trial, found guilty, and consequently burned at the stake. Fifteen or so other slaves are named (some by their already convicted friends) and executed, as well as two whites who were believed to be in on the scheme. The overall atmosphere in the town, despite the incessant executions, is not one of vindication and justice, but one of nagging fear and chaos, where no one trusts anyone and every man is out for himself. <br /> <br />Aswith many of her other books, Rinaldi leaves ample room for interpretation. She doesn't actually say whether the accused were proven guilty, or whether they actually committed the deeds --- as in history. What she does dwell on, however, is the moral implications of each character's actions (especially Phoebe's) and the pains they go through when contemplating their next step. <br /> <br />Although some readers may feel that it reads more like a book for history class rather than one to be poured through for pleasure, THE COLOR OF FIRE is an engaging story that is perfect for learning and sparking discussions about making choices and standing up for one's beliefs despite the consequences. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Alexis Burling	2005-08-11

He just knows it's going to be hard going here. There will be long, boring days and certainly no one his age around. His grandmother Memere gives him a copy of Homer's THE ODYSSEY telling him it's a book that will help. Then his Uncle Danny (his father's brother) asks him if he would be willing to help out on his farm, and reluctantly he agrees --- after all, he can make some money and it's better than watching his mother mope around. <br /> <br />While all this is happening he can't help but notice how his grandmother leaves for a little walk into the nearby forest every night. She seems to come back refreshed and at ease with the world. When he follows her he is totally taken aback as he watches from his hiding place and sees strange people gathering around her: <br /> <br />...They were virtually silent as they drew closer, with only the faintest rustling of the grass to betray their presence. They crept forward with slow, shy movements, like wild animals unsure of their surroundings, ready to flee at a moment's notice. Strangest of all, there was an indefinite quality to them all, a washed-out element --- as if they'd been left out in the rain too long --- that seemed to blur the edges of their movement.  <br /> <br />To his horror he discovers that the figures are ghosts and that they come each night to feed from a small birdbath in which Memere has mixed a few drops of her blood with water. This absolutely goes against everything Aidan has ever believed: <br /> <br />\\"This is ridiculous, Memere. Ghosts are just in stories and cheesy horror movies. They don't really exist.\\" <br />\\"That's right, Aidan. Yet --- here they are,\\" she said. <br /> <br />It is not long before Aidan accepts these strange happenings and sees the possibility that he might even be able to contact his father through the \\"shades.\\" Although his grandmother warns him againstthis, he secretly continues until one day he sees a ghostly young boy and begins to think that his father is trying to communicate with him --- or is this his grief out of control? <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Aidan's mother is developing a relationship with Donny. She is also able to get a job for the coming school year teaching English; though deeply grieved, she moves ahead. Aidan, however, is not ready to accept either the relationship or the other things in his life that seem to have gone out of control. His determination to speak with his father becomes even stronger and leads him into a precarious situation. <br /> <br />Through a series of disappointments and overwhelming griefs, Aidan starts to see the connections of all that is happening in his life. His journey is not, after all, so unlike that of Ulysses. These experiences are softened by the strong support of his grandmother and the other loving adults in his life. By the end of the book Aidan realizes how important his family is and the meaningfulness of his grandmother's wise book selection. <br /> <br />David Stahler Jr. has written a book that deals with both the heartbreak of grief and the peace of acceptance. His characters fight against their realities but are ultimately pulled together through grief and love.

An album of my old friends and your new ones. Real citizens you deserve to greet, and know, and possibly remember. You shall know me by the people I have known.\\" <br /> <br />With over sixty-five books published, including the highly acclaimed novel A DAY NO PIGS WOULD DIE and a series of Soup books that won him the prestigious Mark Twain Award, Robert Newton Peck is a well-seasoned author with an established readership. His books have explored a variety of subjects from his boyhood experiences in rural Vermont to tales about making ends meet while growing up on a farm, as a cattle rancher, or as a solider during the French and Indian War. WEEDS IN BLOOM, Peck's latest literary endeavor, is a simple yet enjoyable autobiography that unfolds as a series of sketches of various people who have influenced his life over the past seventy years. <br /> <br />True to his word, WEEDS IN BLOOM has no plot. Instead, each chapter focuses on a character who fits respectively into one of three periods in Peck's life: his \\"Vermont Boyhood,\\" his \\"Early Manhood,\\" and the \\"Florida Years.\\" Although some readers may miss the safety that accompanies a linear story line, others will feel less bogged down by the lack of a traditional arc, and will delight in using their own imaginations to continue where Peck has left off in each tiny vignette. It is as if he has knowingly created 25 beginnings to 25 possible stories, and by reading through them, his readers are given access to the essence of his life by getting to know the people he has encountered along the way. <br /> <br />In Part I: Vermont Boyhood, Peck explores his childhood in all its rugged, wide-eyed glory. Here, we bear witness to his life at home with his family, complete with all the trappings of a carefree adolescence: practicing baseball in the sweltering summer heat, playing in the dirt until dusk, and learning life-long lessons from his elders. Two of the most memorable chapters in the book are inthis first section --- \\"Miss Kelly,\\" when Robert writes his first poem and shares it with his teacher, Miss Kelly (who proves to be a lasting inspiration for Peck), and \\"Keepsake,\\" when he and his best friend Luther sneak into a truck stop bathroom to buy their first condom at the age of ten. (A humorous side note: Peck actually kept this same condom with him until well after his return from the Army, when he promptly buried the torn and ratty thing in the backyard as a tribute to his boyhood.) <br /> <br />Part II: Early Manhood charts Peck's life in the army and the years immediately following his return. In \\"Dear Elliot,\\" we meet a dear friend and fellow soldier who touched the lives of those around him by simply sharing his care packages from home. Unfortunately, he was killed in battle, but not before altering Peck's life for the better. In \\"Saw\\" and \\"Paper,\\" Peck tells of his grueling yet enlightening experiences in the saw and paper mills, and in \\"Dr. Granberry\\" we are introduced to a football scout for small colleges that would change Peck's life forever by pushing him to go to college and providing him with a scholarship. <br /> <br />Part III: The Florida Years covers the last third of Peck's life up to the present. For the most part, these stories take place in Florida and bear the fruit of his past journeys. As most storytellers are apt to do when looking back on their lives, he sounds wiser and well-worn in these passages, and the people (and animals) we meet in this section are weathered as well. The last entry entitled \\"Just as I Am\\" is a delightful list of thirty-three tried-and-true beliefs and expressions that he has stumbled across and stuck to throughout his life, the last of which being: \\"Wish not for apples. Grow strong trees.\\" <br /> <br />All in all an interesting and personal retrospective of an accomplished author and well-loved cowboy, WEEDS IN BLOOM will surely satisfy young adult readers, particularly those fond of autobiographies and nonfiction. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Alexis Burling	2005-06-28

Even for teenagers who don't want to be professional writers --- even teens who really don't care whether they ever get published anywhere beyond their school paper --- writing is something that can stretch their creativity and help them find their niche, and it's fun.\\" <br /> <br />They cover the benefits of getting into print, such as opening doors for academic scholarships and other benefits, then what to write, where to get ideas and how to find the markets for those ideas. Also, they examine how to establish yourself in cyberspace and the method for moving to bigger and better markets. Practical matters, such as how to be productive doing research and organizing your writing space, are also addressed with separate chapters. The authors weave into the fiber of this book much more than their rich personal experiences. They turn to other frequently published journalists and authors for their insight and add it in the appropriate chapter. The last section of the book includes a broad list of websites where you can learn more about writing and in some cases start your journey to being published. The writing is a breezy, easy-to-read style with plenty of ready-to-do examples. <br /> <br />The Harpers are realistic in what you can and can't accomplish. As they say, \\"In truth, almost anyone can become a writer. But it takes more than time. And it takes more than good writing. You need to learn to come up with ideas for what to write about, do the research, to organize the material, and finally to write it in a way that is informative, or entertaining or both. Can anybody do it? Sort of. Anybody can try to become a writer. Anybody can write something and show it to friends and relatives.

Legend has it that he killed a man for every year of his life and that he was one of the best shots the old west ever saw. But this is the stuff of legend. The real truth surrounding the short life of William H. Bonney Jr. (Billy The Kid) is pretty much speculation. So Theodore Taylor has taken a blend of fact and fiction to create this version of the \\"Kid's\\" life. <br /> <br />Covering the last few weeks in the young desperado's life from an unfortunate train robbery to his grisly death in a gunfight, we are given both the Kid's point of view and that of his cousin and friend, sheriff Willis Monroe. Willis has known Billy since they were both youngsters, and when he hears that there's been a train robbery, he can hardly believe that the boy could be involved. With the hopes of bringing him safely back and clearing his name, Willis sets off to find him. His wife Kate also wants to believe in Billy's innocence but at the same time is frightened for her husband's safety. <br /> <br />Billy, for the time being, had taken the \\"easy\\" way out. Trying to make some quick money, he has fallen into the company of three notorious thieves. What seems like a good opportunity turns out to be poor judgment, and before everything is over, Billy kills one of the thieves (in self-defense), takes all the money and runs. But even when he meets up with Willis and agrees to go back for a trial, the cards seem stacked against him. He escapes from the jail and he and Willis end up in a desperate, bloody gunfight against the original thieves. <br /> <br />Was he a desperado, an outlaw, a murderer, a robber, or just a kid in the wrong place at the right time? 1881 was a hard, ruthless and mostly lawless time in the old west. In Taylor's carefully crafted interpretation, he creates a likable Billy in a fast-moving, good old-fashioned western. The \\"Author's Note\\" at the end explains how he came about writing this fiction and a little of what is known of the real Billy. Taylor, author of THE CAY, has written a book that will perk the interest of anyone who would like a taste of the old west and its legendary characters. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Sally M.

Every piece in this book, whether humorous or heartbreaking, conveys the spirit of what it means to be a son, a father, a friend, a hiker on the trail of self-discovery, and most importantly, a guy. <br /> <br />Even if you're a guy who normally hates to read, check out this book (you can read it one essay at a time if you're busy with sports, girls, or raiding the fridge), and take a look at Jon Scieszka's website, GuysRead.com. <br /> <br />I'd comment more on the book, but the guy in my life has stolen it and won't return it. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Carlie Webber	2005-06-28

She's a proper British teen who has a strong sense of identity. \\"I've always been happy with who I am. Not in a stuck-up, I'm-the-best-thing-that's happened-since-the-invention-of-the-lightbulb sort of way. More in a God's-done-a-lot-worse-than-Sophie-Pitt-Turnbull sort of way. I reckoned that I'd improve with age (like wine or cheese), but I never expected to change.\\"  <br /> <br />Not in her wildest dreams would Sophie Pitt-Turnbull know what she was getting herself into when she begged and pleaded with her parents to let her go on summer vacation --- or holiday, as the British say. Her family had canceled their usual summer trip to France and Sophie couldn't stand the thought of spending all summer watching Jocelyn Scolfield, a friend who Sophie was on the outs with, and Daniel, Sophie's ex-boyfriend who was now dating Jocelyn. Sophie prayed to get out of England. <br /> <br />And then, a miracle! Sophie's mother had an old friend, Jacqueline Salamanca, from art school. Sophie's mother rang Jacqueline every year to wish her a happy birthday. This year, Jacqueline was complaining how her daughter, Cherry, desperately wanted to go to Europe. It was the perfect idea! They could swap daughters for the summer, so that each girl could get a chance to go overseas. <br /> <br />Sophie was thrilled. She'd seen lots of movies about America --- especially New York City where the Salamancas lived. She couldn't wait to go shopping on Fifth Avenue and hit the art galleries in SoHo. <br /> <br />But then she arrives and things are very different from how she had imagined. The Salamancas were not proper, like Sophie's family. In fact, they were the exact opposite. Mrs. Salamanca insists on being called Jake rather than Mrs. Salamanca or Auntie. Her two kids, Gallup and Tampa, even call her Jake. Gallup is obsessed with animals --- their house is filled with strange creatures including a pet pig named Bart. Sophie has to share a room with Tampa who talks in her sleep. Sophie's luggage gets lost and she has no choice but to wear the weird clunky black clothes that Cherry (whose real name is Cherokee) has left behind. And the most shocking of all is that the Salamancas do not live in New York City. They reside in Brooklyn in a falling down, cluttered house that is not remotely close to the SoHo loft that Sophie had envisioned. <br /> <br />Sophie expects that her summer will be even worse than being in England. Will she be able to put up with the wacky lifestyle of these Brooklynites? Can she put aside her culture shock and actually have a good time? <br /> <br />Dyan Sheldon is the author of many books for young readers including CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE DRAMA QUEEN, MY PERFECT LIFE, and PLANET JANET. She does a good job of creating strong female characters and hurdling them through various entertaining obstacles.  <br /> <br />SOPHIE PITT-TURNBULL DISCOVERS AMERICA is a fun read for Brooklynites, Londoners, and everyone else too! It's infused with humor and quirky characters that make for an enjoyable read. A helpful British slang glossary is found at the back of the book to help translate some of Sophie's phrases. Even though the British speak the same language as Americans, there are many things that are different. Can our girl Sophie Pitt-Turnbull who \\"never expected to change\\" adjust to American life?

The people, particularly those who still lived in rural areas, were also torn between the old ways (those of pagan ritual and superstition) and the new ways (those of rationality, order, and a particularly austere form of Christianity). Julie Hearn's tremendous new novel, THE MINISTER'S DAUGHTER, vividly embodies these conflicts in the deeply personal story of two young women from opposite sides of the divide. <br /> <br />Nell is the granddaughter of the local cunning woman. Nell herself is a Merrybegot, a child conceived on Mayday, one of the most magical festivals of the year. Part healer, part midwife, part wise woman, Nell's grandmother feels the change in the air and, fearing for her own sanity as well as for her ability to continue practicing her arts in the changing political and religious environment, eagerly apprentices Nell to her craft. Soon enough, Nell is ministering not only to laboring human women and to flatulent men but also to piskies and other magical creatures, one of whom recognizes her as a chosen Merrybegot and rewards her with a gift more precious than anything she could have imagined. <br /> <br />Grace, on the other hand, is the older daughter of the village's Puritan minister. Virtuous, devout and submissive, Grace is nothing like wild, bold Nell. Smitten with a handsome local boy, Grace soon finds herself pregnant with her own Merrybegot. Desperate to hide her pregnancy from her authoritarian father, she convinces her nave younger sister Patience that her condition is the result of witchcraft practiced by Nell and her grandmother. Soon the villagers, torn between loyalty to the past and fear of the unknown, don't know whom to trust. <br /> <br />In THE MINISTER'S DAUGHTER, Julie Hearn masterfully condenses so many of the vast political and religious conflicts of the day into what seems on the surface to be a very small story about one girl's unwanted pregnancy and its unforeseen consequences. At the same time, she manages to craft a tale that is both historically resonant and genuinely magical, peopled as it is with real-life historical characters such as Charles II as well as by piskies (pixies). These magical creatures are not just your average diaphanous fairies, though; like much of the magic in the novel, their influences are far-reaching and, although they provide comic elements, their concerns are great. Nell herself acknowledges the power of the supernatural the first time she attempts to perform significant magic after her grandmother's death: \\"This is a trip of the most terrifying kind, so weird yet so utterly believable that to suffer it is to know yourself at the mercy of whatever devils your mind cares to spit in your face.\\" <br /> <br />The narrative structure of the book also contributes to its effectiveness. The bulk of the novel is narrated in a third-person present tense voice set in 1645 but carrying an oddly prescient tone, often prophesying events that will happen to minor characters months or even years in the future. Interjected with these chapters, though, is the voice of Grace's younger sister Patience. In 1692 Salem, Massachusetts, Patience narrates the events of 1645 through the lens of the Salem witch trials and her own tragic miscomprehension of those earlier days, in a tone that grows increasingly hateful until it reaches the chilling climax. <br /> <br />THE MINISTER'S DAUGHTER is Julie Hearn's first novel to be published in the United States. If this superb tale is any indication of her talents, readers soon will be clamoring to read much more from this accomplished writer. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl	2005-06-28

We soon learn that he died over the summer, although we don't know how. Marty was with Steven that day, but she has kept the circumstances of his death shrouded from her family, her classmates and everyone else. <br /> <br />Slowly, over the course of the novel, Marty reveals the details of what happened. UPSTREAM, though, is less the story of Steven's mysterious death than of Marty's healing. She begins her senior year of high school withdrawn, avoiding the stares and whispers of the curious. Then she meets Katherine, a recently divorced 28-year-old who has just moved to town from California and bought the old movie theater where Marty works. It takes time for Marty to truly open up to her, but as their friendship deepens, she recognizes in Katherine a sadness similar to her own: \\"She misses someone. Maybe someone in her old life. Someone I'll never know.\\" <br /> <br />Marty introduces the California girl to the rhythms and joys of Alaska life, such as the patience and strength needed for sockeye-salmon fishing, and the thrill of the hard-won catch. Katherine literally brings sunshine into Marty's world. She paints the dingy movie house walls a buttery yellow and organizes a beach movie marathon on the shortest day of the long Alaska winter. But as with Lion's first novel, SWOLLEN, these bright spots don't entirely eclipse the dark. There's no magical remedy for Marty's pain, and like the Alaska spring that brings just eight more minutes of light each day, Marty's recovery is incremental, and so natural, that she almost doesn't notice it. <br /> <br />UPSTREAM is firmly rooted in Marty's home state, so that the Alaska wilderness itself becomes another character: the two bull moose jousting in a meadow near where Marty takes Katherine fishing; the round red berries, Steven's favorite, that taste exactly like watermelon; the deep, cloudy blue of the river at Cooper Landing. \\"I'm grateful for the glaciers and the runoff and that I'll always be reminded of the color of his eyes,\\" Marty says toward the end of the book. And as readers, we're grateful to Melissa Lion for sharing with us the beauty and the melancholy of Marty's world. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Carolyn Juris	2005-06-28

Fans of last year's THE AU PAIRS have been waiting for the hinted-at sequel where Mara, Eliza and Jacqui were supposed to go on a tropical winter break with the Perry family. For some reason, that idea was abandoned, and there is only brief mention of Eliza and Jacqui's winter with the Perrys, where Eliza and Ryan Perry were up to no good while Mara was away. That's just the beginning of the changes for this summer. <br /> <br />Eliza gets a job with a hot club instead of working with the Perry children, and a new au pair, Philippe, moves into the quarters with Mara and Jacqui.

His job is to take care of the lab rats and make sure they don't kill each other. These are not your common variety lab rats; they were bred to be ruthless predators. There is one particular rat called General, a white rodent with an extra large brain that is smarter and more dangerous than it first seems. Curtis realizes that there are \\"experiments\\" that are far more disturbing than killer rats, but knows that it's better to pretend not to notice and stay out of trouble.    One evening, during a routine feeding, Curtis hears something seeking attention from another lab. He decides to ignore the noise at first, but is startled when the mysterious creature asks for food and starts shrieking. This makes the lab rats restless and Curtis curious. He decides to find out what is hidden in the other room. What, or rather who, he finds is nothing like he has ever met before or will ever meet again.    At first, all Curtis sees is a distressed young girl with white blond hair, but then he notices the brilliant orange eyes that are the reason for her trapped existence. Dusk is the product of a military experiment gone wrong. Many years before, the army wanted to see if soldiers could have night vision. A human embryo was injected with hawk genes, and Dusk was born. They found that she was more than they could handle, so they have kept her sedated and locked in a cage during most of her young life.    While Curtis is trying to make sense of the shocking discovery, a fire accidentally breaks out and burns down the military facility. Curtis manages to rescue Dusk and himself from being victims of the deadly blaze, but loses sight of Dusk as she escapes to the nearby ghost town of Prospect. Dusk isn't the only \\"experiment\\" to survive, as General, along with some of his followers, and Wolf --- a killer guard dog --- also flee to Prospect.    Two years go by, and Curtis's sonJay shows up from the city to stay with his dad in the backwoods for the summer. Jay is going through some tough times and doesn't understand his religious mother or his father, who turns to drinking to drown out his pain. One day, he decides to run errands and goes by Prospect. Meanwhile, Dusk keeps watch from the steeple of a church as the mutant survivors take turns during the day ruling the ghost town. Little do Jay and Dusk know that their very different worlds are about to collide and be turned upside down.    DUSK is a stunning work of science fiction that is interesting and disturbing at the same time. It reminds readers just how far we've come from the early days of sci-fi, when ideas like computers and space age were thought to be unrealistic and impossible. Hopefully, combining animal and human genes together in freak experiments won't happen anytime soon. One thing is for sure though: readers will find this book hard to put down.    [...]	2005-06-28

Then Cassie poignantly remembers her choice to delay making love with Kyle because she felt they had all the time in the world. Now that chance is forever gone.    Cassie realizes that she can't leave yet to go on to what's beyond; she still has something she must do here first. She contemplates death as well as some surprises --- such as her sudden knowledge that she can affect matter by swaying tree branches or tumbling a leaf. However, her biggest revelation is that she's not alone. Another dead girl, Birdie, keeps Cassie company as they share stories about their lives. Birdie, too, feels that she can't quite leave for the next world.    DEAD ON TOWN LINE invites comparisons with THE LOVELY BONES in subject matter, and yet is completely unlike it in style. The verses are spare and lovely, depicting Cassie's love for music and despair over her many losses. Some of the images, of murder and of what happens to a body after death, are fleetingly brutal but appropriate. The depiction of Cassie's death is heartbreaking and chilling, yet leaves the reader with an uplifting hope. It was impossible to stop reading Cassie's highly original story, and I found the ending to be poignant and memorable.    [...]	2005-06-28

Holly, Lina and Madison are enjoying the popularity that the success of their matchmaking project has brought them --- Holly is still dating Rob; Lina is still in love with her young teacher, Dan; and Madison is still madly in love with the swim star, Sean. As the novel progress, teenage angst at its best occurs. Holly becomes increasingly annoyed with Rob, most notably because of the cheesy sayings on his T-shirts and the way he asks for Holly's permission before kissing her. Lina discovers a personal ad that Dan has written. She answers, but not as herself --- rather, she responds as a college student who's studying film. Madison decides to use a portrait of Sean as the centerpiece for her art project, showing how her life revolves around her infatuation of him.    Returning are some minor characters, including Audrey, Madison's kid sister; Ramona, the leader of the We Love Dan cult; and Sebastiano, Holly's locker buddy. A new character is Stephen Costello, a fellow artist who becomes pals with Madison.    Like the first installment in the series, this book deals with relationships, friendships, self-esteem, confidence, and a host of other issues that teen readers will be able to relate to. Standiford's strength is her characterization and the realistic voice she creates for her characters. The three main protagonists are likable, believable, and just flawed enough to make them real. There is a lot of humor here as well --- the sayings on Rob's shirts are cheesy but funny, the rapport between the girls is full of zingers, and Ramona's saving of Dan's used napkins is creepy but at the same time humorous.    Standiford already has written the third installment of The Dating Game, entitled CAN TRUE LOVE SURVIVE HIGH SCHOOL? I believe that Standiford's series will survive much more than that.

Georgia Tate lives happily with her grandparents. Her mama died years ago and her father moved away. She gets cards occasionally and sees him even less frequently. Life is just fine as it is.    Then everything gets turned upside down. Georgia Tate's best friend Ginger tells her that her mama isn't dead after all, just absent. Georgia Tate doesn't know what to make of this news and decides to talk to her grandparents about it. Next, Nana dies, and Georgia Tate's grandfather decides that the best thing to do is to send her down to live with her father. The problem is, Georgia Tate's dad isn't a very good parent. He begins to ask her to dress in mature clothing and go out to bars with him every night.    Georgia Tate doesn't like living with him, and soon he begins abusing her. But she manages to make the best of it, always keeping a smile on her face. She befriends Tamika, a drag queen and Mary Kay salesgirl, and Marie-Bernard, an elderly Haitian woman, both of whom help her out when times get tough.    This is a well-written novel, but it is hard to stomach. The subject matter is serious, although it is handled well and there are no graphic scenes. The best thing about the book is that Georgia Tate is a realistic character and her voice always shines through. She manages to keep her head up and does her best to stay strong through every storm that comes her way.    CLAIMING GEORGIA TATE is not exactly a light beach read, but it is a good first novel with an inspiring story behind it.    [...]	2005-06-28

Kids don't go to school anymore; they stay home and watch EduTV for their education. At least until they are 14. Then the rich kids go on to high school and college, while the poor attempt to find a job, any job, though there isn't much available. They live in crowded shack towns and eat processed food chips with flavors like broccoli and chicken. Life is hard and bleak for these kids, with few comforts and fewer opportunities. The only possible happiness has to come from within (which everyone knows is where true happiness comes from anyway), because there's certainly not much pleasure otherwise. The poor kids do have one, very slim chance of getting to college and finding a good job, and that's through the scholarship lottery system. A very few get lucky; most don't. <br /> <br /> So when a reality TV show offers 14-year-olds an opportunity at a big money prize, thousands jump at the chance to apply. \\"Historical Survivor\\" is a favorite program on EduTV. Contestants participate in recreated historical situations like the Civil War and The Alamo, right down to every dangerous detail, including the risk of injury and even death. This special teen edition puts five teenagers in Antarctica on a remake of Robert Scott's race to the South Pole in 1912. <br /> <br /> Polly, Grace, Robert, Andrew and Billy all apply for different reasons, with different hopes and dreams. Each is chosen because of a specific and special talent he or she possesses. Then they ship out to the frozen and hostile world of Antarctica armed with the same supplies and equipment that Scott's expedition had back in 1912. Scott's men didn't survive. Will this group of 14-year-olds be able to? <br /> <br /> Author Andrea White leads this page-turning adventure with creativity and excitement. She sprinkles in accurate and informative details with the story that will have readers learning a bit of history while having an awesome journey through their imagination. <br /> <br /> --- Reviewed by Chris Shanley-Dillman, author	2005-06-08

It will be dreamy. It will be all that a girl ever wanted. Ninth-grader Charlotte (Charlie to her friends) has been thinking about her first kiss for years. But then one day, Charlie is taken out of her dream world when Kevin Lazarus grabs her hand and pulls her outside of the school.     \\"Kevin led me quickly around the side of the building, then stopped.

There I was, pressed up against the brick wall, kissing Kevin. A decorative sticking-out brick was digging into my backbone, but I didn't want to wreck my first kiss by readjusting. I squeezed my eyes shut and tried to concentrate.\\"     Charlie is taken aback by her kissing encounter, and then getting caught by the principal. (The decorative brick was right outside his window!) Instead of gossiping with her best friend Tess about Kevin, Charlie keeps it to herself, a decision that ends up coming back to haunt her. At a party soon after the Charlie-Kevin kiss, Kevin kisses Tess! And before she knows it, Tess and Kevin are dating and Charlie is caught up in a web of lies.     Despite everything, Charlie still finds herself thinking about Kevin. Why did he kiss her? Did he still like her? He's now off-limits because Tess is dating him. To make him even more off-limits, Charlie finds out that her own divorced mother is dating Kevin's father!

Jane, the elder sibling, was always able to create games her sister Lily loved. But Lily wants to grow up. She starts making friends at school and gets her first boyfriend, while Jane seems stuck in increasingly violent fantasies. <br /> <br /> The family comes to realize that Jane is mentally ill. She is put on anti-psychotic medication, but even with the aid of medication Jane realizes she will never be the same kind of normal as her younger, popular sister. An accident separates the sisters, and the story, narrated from opposite sides of the grave, is about the two sisters --- one living, one dead --- still trying to make peace with the life they shared together. <br /> <br /> Adele Griffin is the author of a number of psychologically insightful thrillers for young people. Previous books include THE OTHER SHEPARDS, about two young people haunted by the death of the elder siblings they were born to replace; SONS OF LIBERTY, about brothers banding together to overcome their controlling and abusive father; and AMANDINE, about a girl who becomes enmeshed in a dangerous and manipulative friendship. Griffin is a master at blurring the line between what is real and what is imagined, making her books truly spooky. <br /> <br /> Mental illness is a popular subject within novels for young people. The teen years are when many mental illnesses begin to appear. WHERE I WANT TO BE is an insightful portrait of living with mental illness, but it never reveals what illness from which Jane is suffering. It is not alone in this omission. Most fiction on this subject never makes a diagnosis. This does an enormous disservice to the reader, and encourages people to look at mental illness as one large disease rather than a variety of different disorders, all with different causes, symptoms, and treatments. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, readers are likely to enjoy this story about a sibling rivalry that continues into the afterlife. WHERE I WANT TO BE is a late-summer teen gothic about ghosts that drive VW bugs, pick strawberries, and lounge in the dusky twilight by the pool. <br /> <br /> --- Reviewed by Sarah A.

His father Bernard has moved on with his life, creating a new family with his girlfriend Birdie and Dec's little sister Sunny. Bernard is content with his life in the present while pursuing his hobby building miniature models of famous battles in history. Dec would rather just face the future when he could leave his family's home and perhaps pursue a career in architecture.     Then one day, Dec and Sunny come across the body of a mysterious intruder in Steeple Hall, his father's family home where Dec had spent his early childhood years before Lindy left. Dec briefly met the intruder when he hitched a ride from him a few weeks before and thinks that because he accidentally mentioned a secret road leading to the old house, this prompted the man to take a chance at burglary. When Sunny mentions that a bust of Plato was placed on a side table instead of by the fallen bookshelf where it once sat, Dec begins to think that something far more sinister has taken place.     The mysterious death causes Dec to begin having visions of his mother as he remembered her when he was a young child: Lindy being dressed as Wonder Woman, Lindy and Dec playing hide-and-seek with a frustrated Bernard, and Lindy telling a young Dec to rescue her from the manor. The visions are hazy and surreal, making Dec wonder if they are really memories or just dreams. He decides to ask Bernard and Birdie questions about Lindy, but they're unwilling to reveal many details especially as to why Lindy left. Frustrated, Dec seeks refuge in Steeple Hall and confides in his best friend Ezra, a quirky science geek who helps him make sense of the bizarre visions.

They know that they'll eat sour grain and sawdust everyday except Christmas and that they'll always work from before sunrise until after dusk every day for all the days of their lives.\\" <br /> <br /> When 47 is just a boy, perhaps twelve or thirteen, he begins to understand how hard being a slave can be because it's then that he finds himself in the cotton fields and taken from the nurturing care of Big Mama Flore. Mama Flore had tried to prepare him for the difficult turn his life would take. Being a slave means not knowing your birthdates and often never knowing your own blood-related family. 47 doesn't even know if he has any other name because Master Tobias gives him a number rather than a name --- it's as simple as that. <br /> <br /> Living in the slave quarters with grown men and working from dawn to dusk, the most important thing to 47 is trying to stay out of the overseer Mr. Stewarts's way. He begins to understand Big Mama's words: \\"White peoples gots as many ages as you can count but slaves on'y gots four ages. That's babychile, boy or girl, old boy or old girl, an'dead.\\" 47 has seen more than one slave beaten to death and others who have been taken to the killin' shack. \\"And those that did come back were never the same.\\" <br /> <br /> One day, however, everything changes for 47 and for every slave and white person on Corinthian Plantation when, by chance, he literally runs into \\"Tall John.\\" <br /> <br /> \\"He was the most beautiful being I had ever known. His skin was the color of highly polished brass but a little darker, a little like copper too but not quite. His eyes were almond-shaped and large with red-brown pupils. He was bare-chested and slender, but there was elegance in his lean stance. All he wore was a pair of loose blue trousers cinched at the waist with a piece of rope.\\" <br /> <br /> There is no explaining the immediate attraction between the boy and Tall John. John seems to look deep inside of him and know his every fear. Tall John tells him that he has finally \\"found\\" him and that he, 47, is a special boy with a special mission. Over a period of time 47 finds Tall John even more mysterious. <br /> <br /> \\"I knew that he wasn't one of us, the slaves, but something different, something that neither I nor anyone I had ever known had met. I knew right then that the run-away Lemuel, now calling himself Tall John, was something like an angel, or a devil.\\" <br /> <br /> Tall John has a way of communicating with people that makes them pause. He, however, cannot predict the evil within Mr. Stewart or the anger in Master Tobias. After he magically saves the slave master's daughter, he and 47 are turned over to Mr. Stewart because they are slaves. Even with all of this, none of them is ready for the strength and wisdom of what Tall John is able to convey. Nor are they prepared for the horrible violence and tragedy that results from the blinding hatred that men pour upon one another. <br /> <br /> Walter Mosley has written a kind of biblical, historical allegory with a touch of science fiction thrown in. Within this story there is a serious look at the problems of good and evil and the not-so-subtle implications on the wounds of racial prejudice. As this book closes the reader knows terrible and needless deaths have occurred and that those left have not finished their journey. You will want to know more about all the wonderfully realized characters in this little book. You will hope that 47 and the possibility of his new life will come again in a sequel to this thought-provoking, finely wrought tale. <br /> <br /> The cover art is at once mystical and beautiful, presented with an old-fashioned black and white picture of plantation slaves in a cotton field. Floating above them against a faded blue sky is an orange number \\"47\\" and above that a strange configuration of lines. The lines, which look similar to astrological maps, are repeated throughout the book atthe beginning of each chapter. These symbols all tie in to the story like the pieces of a lovely puzzle --- all together a wonderful and magical experience. <br /> <br /> --- Reviewed by Sally M. Tibbetts	2005-06-08

Yet Egg's original take on the world, combined with the emotional journey she undergoes, makes BOY PROOF a fun and thought-provoking novel. <br /> <br /> This is a character-driven book, centering on the first-person narrator. Egg (aka Victoria Jurgen) has trouble relating to people. Her weird trappings serve to shelter her from the difficulties and heartbreak that go along with relationships. Although she gets along well with her father, a mask maker and animatronic specialist, she lives with her mother, a former actress who Egg seems to have no respect for. Egg belongs to the sci-fi club at school, but she remains aloof from the other members and takes care not to call them friends. Her personal life consists of photography, drawing, and dreaming about the stars of her favorite movie, Terminal Earth. She seems to like it that way. <br /> <br /> Until Max Carter moves to town. Immediately intrigued by Egg, he offers her friendship and --- possibly --- something more. Egg is attracted. Max shares so many of her interests, and she stumbles across him in the most unlikely places. Unsure how to react, however, she rebuffs him, and her moment to create a friendship seems lost. A series of unrelated events eventually inspires Egg to realize that unless she makes some changes, she's looking at a lonely future. <br /> <br /> Funny and creative, Egg is impossible not to like. The first-person narration is very successful here, letting the reader compare how others view Egg --- unfriendly and snobbish --- versus how she really is inside, a mass of worry and doubt. Although most of the book follows Egg's goals and dreams, at least one minor character emerges as a person in her own right, rather than just a depiction of how Egg views her. There are no terrible secrets in Egg's past, and I found the story better for that --- many kids are lonely and alienated just because they are, and Egg speaks well to the ways in which an imaginative teenager can find that her interests make her feel lost rather than bonding with others. <br /> <br /> Even those who aren't sci-fi fans should enjoy this book; the sci-fi aspect comes across as a vital part of Egg's personality rather than an author indulging her own interest. Max didn't work as well for me, however. Complete with glamorous past, he seemed too perfect --- more like the friend or boyfriend Egg would have imagined than a real person. I would have liked to have seen a few flaws. And the book's ending wrapped things up a bit too neatly for my taste. <br /> <br /> These are minor problems, however. For readers who like books about relationships and people transcending their own limitations as they reach out to others, BOY PROOF is a great read. <br /> <br /> --- Reviewed by Paula Jolin	2005-06-08

It is Mike, herself, who struggles with what it means to be the only lesbian in town and in love with a girl who does not return her feelings. <br /> <br /> Peters, a Denver author, has a deft touch with the Midwestern dialect. She writes about Coalton and its inhabitants with a deep knowledge and affection for the Midwest. Her descriptions and characterizations ring true. So does her refusal to simplify FAR FROM XANADU into a simple, issue-driven, teen novel. <br /> <br /> At its simplest FAR FROM XANADU is about unrequited love and what happens when a person falls in love with someone just slightly out of reach. While Mike's sexual identity is a big part of the story, it is not the book's exclusive focus. The best parts of the novel feature Mike's friendships with her flamboyantly gay best friend Jamie, and with the devastating Xanadu. Instead of dwelling exclusively on the external pressures Mike faces, Peters writes about Mike's internal battle for self-acceptance. As Mike says, \\"I just wanted to get past wishing I'd been born different, to accepting that I was. Finding the joy in that.\\" <br /> <br /> --- Reviewed by Sarah A. Wood	2005-06-08

From the midnight runs to the cutting weight to plotting maneuvers in their sleep, wrestling is all they think about during the winter sports season. Both compete in the 129-pound weight class, and both refuse to let anything stand in the way of the state championship title. <br /> <br /> Beyond their mutual love of wrestling, however, Bobby and Ivan couldn't be more different. Bobby's school wrestling team is known throughout New Jersey for its winning record. His family, though rich, is troubled by his mother's long working hours and his father's infidelity, and news that Bobby's girlfriend might be pregnant leaves Bobby wondering exactly where his life is headed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Ivan and his small-town farming father are grieving his mother, who was a strong influence in both their lives, and Ivan's anger and loss are felt by everyone except for his neighbor Shelley, who encourages Ivan's talents. Ivan's only hope of leaving his backwater town of Lemmings is a scholarship to Western Arizona University, but his father wants him to attend college close to home. <br /> <br /> Each chapter alternates a point of view, taking the reader through both Bobby's and Ivan's journeys to the state championship. Alfred C. Martino, a wrestling fan, brings the excitement of their matches into the story. Both characters have depth and devotion to the people they love, even though their commitment to wrestling sometimes eats away at their relationships. Reading this book will make you think twice about the dumb jock stereotype. <br /> <br /> --- Reviewed by Carlie Webber <br />	2005-06-08

He has lots of friends and a girlfriend who all adore him. His parents think highly of him and hope that he will follow in their Ivy League and medical school footsteps.     Ethan, however, is not as interested in science and math as his parents think. In fact, his near-perfect grades are threatened by his performance in chemistry class. Wanting to please his family, and the role they hope he will play, Ethan remains silent and lets them believe he is on track to medical school. The one thing that is truly important to Ethan, however, is neither science nor math, but the theatre.     And then, Lydia Krane shows up one day in Ethan's chemistry class. There's something compelling about the new girl, with her changing accents and babydoll t-shirts. Plus, Lydia is different from Ethan's family and friends. She doesn't expect him to be something he's not, and they have something in common --- the love of the stage. Both Ethan and Lydia try out for the spring play, a modern-day reinterpretation of the Shakespearean classic, Macbeth. They get parts, and become closer friends.     Ethan confides in Lydia what he can't confide in anyone else: \\"No matter how hard I try, I just won't ever be as smart as them, as good as them...I'm just really good at faking it...I'm doing it all the time, twenty-four/seven. Acting like I'm a good student, good son, good everything. Acting like it comes easy to me. But it's a real struggle. I feel like a total fraud half the time.\\"     As Ethan continues the facade of good student, he does the unthinkable. He cheats on a chemistry exam rather than risk getting a bad grade. His plan backfires when he gets caught, but then Lydia Krane intervenes, which in the end makes Ethan's situation worse.     As Ethan lets Lydia into his life more and more, he notices that Lydia is changing and becoming more clingy and more obsessed with him. Ethan finds out more is at risk than his perfect image, and Lydia is not who he thought she was at all.     CAUGHT IN THE ACT is an engaging novel with a twisting storyline. Author Peter Moore does a good job of letting us into Ethan's life and exploring, along with Ethan, who he really is. The character of Lydia Krane is both creepy and mesmerizing.

At first glance Max might look like an average 14-year-old girl, but you'll quickly realize that she's anything but ordinary. Max has wings! And they aren't just for decoration either. Max can fly; she can soar high into the clear, blue sky like a bird! And Max can do this because she actually is part bird! Sounds pretty cool, eh? Well, not exactly.<br /><br />See, Max spends the first 10 years of her life locked in a tiny cage at a place called The School. There she suffers through test after horrid test from the scientists who created her by adding bird DNA to her own human DNA. While there, she meets five other winged kids, and with the help of a sympathetic scientist, the six of them manage to escape. This fantastic freedom becomes the happiest time in their lives, bonding Max, Fang, Iggy, the Gasman, Nudge and Angel into a family, the only family any of them has ever known.<br /><br />But then out of nowhere, their past catches up with them. The Erasers discover their hideout and snatch up six-year-old Angel! Another experiment of the school, Erasers are half-humans, half-wolves, and a whole lot of mean. Max and the others would rather die than have Angel back in the hands of the evil scientists, so they set out to rescue Angel, thus taking a flying leap into this fast-paced adventure that just doesn't stop, not even when the pages end. Along the way they uncover more and more questions that --- just maybe --- they don't really want to know the answers to, like the truth about their parents and the mysterious voice echoing instructions in Max's head.<br /><br />James Patterson is an amazing storyteller, grabbing the reader's attention on page one and holding on with color and humor all the way through the book.

That is, until his mother receives word of the sudden death in America of her wacky younger sister Galaxy. When Matthew's mother returns to the United Kingdom after attending the funeral, she has a surprise in tow: Matthew's cousin Sam. <br /> <br />Sam seems to fit in well with Matthew and his friends --- he is funny and smartmouthed, and he knows a lot about music. But Sam can also be rude, sullen, and aggressive. Can he be trusted to be a valuable member of the gang? The boys decide to give Sam a test: if he can spend the first few days of the school year dressed as a girl, he will have proven his loyalty to his new friends. Even better, Sam can use his disguise to spy on the Sheds's rival girl gang and learn all their secrets <br /> <br />At first Sam resists the idea, but he really needs friends at his new school, so he gives the plan a go. With his flowing blonde hair, small size, and good looks, Sam makes a better girl than anyone had imagined. Soon enough, he infiltrates the girls' group, starts fashion trends, and catches the eye of the Big Man on Campus. He even seems to enjoy being a girl, and his playful attitude toward his new role also seems to help him overcome the grief of losing his mother. <br /> <br />The borderline ridiculous plot offers plenty of opportunities for truly funny situations, as Sam relishes playing with gender role expectations. There's also lots of humor in the rapidly changing narration, as the story is told from the points of view of students, teachers, and parents alike. The only person who doesn't have a voice is Sam --- readers get to know Sam simply through his outlandish behavior and through other characters' impressions of him/her. <br /> <br />Sam's story gets a little over the top when his ex-con dad shows up from America, demanding his son andhis share of the inheritance money. Everything comes to a crisis during the big school concert at the end of the book, and then wraps up a little too quickly and neatly. Among all the crazy antics of the book's characters, though, BOY2GIRL also has a serious point about the divisiveness of traditional sex roles and expectations, and about the importance of seeing people for who they really are. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl	2005-04-18

All of the quiz takers are students, which allows the girls --- Holly, Mads and Lina --- to get an insider's view of what their fellow students are thinking and feeling when it comes to dating and sex. <br /> <br />The story focuses on the search for the right person to date, the urge to be popular, the feeling of being alone and isolated, and the potential hurt caused by nasty rumors. The situations presented here are ones faced by most high school students, and the girls' reactions to them are quite realistic. <br /> <br />Readers will care very much about the main characters. Holly, Mads and Lina are close friends and do not compete with one another. They have their own strengths and weaknesses, and are honest about them. All three have romantic designs on boys who are unattainable for different reasons and for different lengths of time. <br /> <br />The supporting characters are decently developed: Dan, the young teacher, seems charming and the potential boyfriends are interesting. Holly's boyfriend begins dating her because the other boys talked about how friendly she is. He ends up genuinely caring for Holly, but they need to work through some issues before they can have a healthy relationship. The parents are a bit underdeveloped and seem more like caricatures than characters, but I think this was a deliberate choice on the author's part. THE DATING GAME is not about the parents; it revolves around the teenage protagonists. <br /> <br />Probably the best-developed supporting character is Ramona, the gothic student who is in love with Dan. She is an interesting foil for all three main characters and injects a lot of humor into the story. <br /> <br />Every chapter begins with a rotating horoscope of one of the main characters, a catchy twist and an interesting lead-in to the happenings in each chapter. The premise of an online project, and its fresh humor, could keep this series going strong for quite some time. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Melissa A.

She is sooooo sick of being an ugly. In the meantime, she daringly travels from her dorm in Uglyville to New Pretty Town in order to see her best friend, Peris. When she finds him, newly pretty Peris seems annoyed, asking why Tally couldn't wait the three months to see him. Just as troubling, the tiny scar on his palm matching hers, from their rite of blood brothership, has vanished --- replaced with perfect beautiful skin. <br /> <br />Escaping from New Pretty Town, Tally meets Shay, another ugly waiting to become pretty. The two become great friends, hoverboarding and plotting practical jokes together. When Tally shares her choices for her upcoming transformation (she favors a sultry Cleopatra look), Shay amazes her with her attitude. Shay hasn't even bothered to decide how she'll look as a pretty. <br /> <br />Tally buys the party line taught in school: a world of pretties is the only way to make everyone equal. It solves the long-ago problems of judging people by appearances and waging wars based on skin color. Besides, everyone wants to go through the rite of passage. <br /> <br />Shay persuades Tally to sneak into the restricted area outside the city where she discovers a wild stretch of white water, mountains, trees, and the ruin of an old city. Shay confides that she hopes to meet a mysterious person named David here. Shay's talk troubles Tally. Shay maintains that she not only doesn't want to become a pretty but that the operation is in fact unnatural. She even swears that she and Tally are not freaks as uglies. <br /> <br />As Tally approaches her sixteenth birthday and her transformation, Shay invites her to travel to David's home, the Smoke --- a place where everyone lives together in freedom, where there are no uglies and no pretties. <br /> <br />Naturally, Tally refuses to go. But when her long-anticipated operation day arrives, she is confronted with the frightening Special Circumstances team. Her life takes an unexpected turn when she learns that she must spy on runaway Shay in order to become pretty. Tally plunges into an amazing quest in which the ante constantly ratchets upward, plunging her into one impossible situation after another. <br /> <br />With extreme makeover shows like \\"The Swan\\" transforming people into pretty clones, Tally's world seems creepily not all that far-fetched.

Broken out into four distinct sections (Russia: 1897; Russia: 1900; America, Ellis Island, New York: 1904; and Epilogue), this moving account of a young musician and his eight-year journey to escape his oppressive, anti-Semitic Russian homeland and find freedom in America, not only entertains, but also addresses a number of important issues that are still relevant in today's worn-torn society, in language that is suitable for middle-grade readers. <br /> <br />Russia: 1897. Fifteen-year-old Reuven Bloom and his family live in the Pale of Settlement --- the \\"Jewish area\\" of Russia consisting of twenty-five provinces that include Ukraine, Lithuania, Belorussia, Crimea, and part of Poland. Life in the Pale is less than idyllic as supplies are minimal and the threat of attack by the Cossacks is constant. Despite these setbacks, however, the Blooms have managed to build a closely-knit family unit fortified by trust, religious faith, and a strong dependence on the community. Reuven's devotion to playing the violin is outdone only by the love he feels for his family. But on the sixth night of Hanukkah, when the village is ransacked and his family is brutally murdered in front of his eyes, Reuven and his baby sister, Rachel, must leave all they know and embark on a treacherous journey that will hopefully lead them to safety. <br /> <br />Russia: 1900. Following a number of life-threatening encounters and just as many narrow escapes, Reuven and his sister are miraculously united with their cousin, Lovotz Sperling, a well-known and respected leader of the Bund --- the Algemayner Yidisher Arbayter of Lithuania, Poland, and Russia, also known as the Jewish Worker's Federation. Taking Reuven and Rachel under his wing, Lovotz provides them with shelter and promises to send them to America along with his wife and children. But when Lovotz is murdered, Reuven makes a difficult decision to sacrifice his own freedom and his love for music in order to continue Lovotz's work as a revolutionary firebrand. Over the course of the next few years, Reuven climbs the ranks to become one of the Bund's greatest assets and a key player in the fight against Jewish persecution. <br /> <br />America, Ellis Island, New York: 1904/Epilogue. In 1904, Reuven is ultimately reunited with Rachel and Lovotz's family in America. In time, he falls in love, gets married, and begins playing the violin again as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic. At the novel's conclusion, Reuven finally has risen above his past and attained the three things he's always wanted: freedom, fame, and a family. <br /> <br />Music references frequent the pages, and a brief Historical Note is included for context. There are moments (especially towards the end) where the storytelling feels a bit too forced --- the ends too nicely tied --- which may frustrate some readers. However, as a whole, BROKEN SONG reads like a bracing adventure story, supported by a well-balanced fusion of actual historic events and Lasky's imaginative spin on her own family's background. <br /> <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Alexis Burling	2005-04-18

But she surprises herself by feeling an odd fondness for the ugly child, who she names Lump, and she assembles a sort of family to help her care for the boy: a she-bear, a malevolent demon, and her familiar, a cat named Falance. <br /> <br />As Lump grows, he struggles to find his own magical powers and his relationship to the other humans nearby. In the meantime, his foster mother has the same problems as working mothers everywhere: how to balance her time between tending the Midsummer fires and caring for her child. The witch, who is more powerful than Lump understands, is mystified by motherhood. She thinks, \\"I have always known what to do; I see the Pattern clear as my own hand, and I follow it and am content. But there is no guide here, and every path I can see leads to some pain. Perhaps this is part of having a child; the Pattern is of no use, and there is this aching in my heart.\\" <br /> <br />Soon enough, disaster strikes, and Lump, the witch, and Falance hit the road. Robbed of her powers when she makes the ultimate sacrifice for her child, the witch must find a new life for herself: \\"It is the case that I cannot be both a mother and a witch, or not the sort of witch I was.\\" In the meantime, Lump grows more distant, demanding, and hard to love.

There are the parts that are fiction, the parts that are based on fact, and the parts that are true, even if they never actually happened. All these parts fit together to present a bigger picture. In her novel, OTHER ECHOES, author Adle Geras compares all the different parts of her story to pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Individually they are the setting of Borneo, a picnic on the beach, a cruel game of \\"Cowboys and Indians\\" beneath the tropical sun, a strange doll and an even stranger man. Together they reveal a larger picture about the British colonial experience following World War II. <br /> <br />OTHER ECHOES is told from the point-of-view of 17-year-old Flora, convalescing in the sanatorium of her English boarding school. Flora recalls her childhood in Borneo, where she and her parents moved after WWII. There she gets caught up in the limited social sphere of the other British colonial children. Tormented by their bullying, she sets out to prove her bravery by doing the one thing they fear. She visits the abandoned house on the hill. <br /> <br />Further pieces of the puzzle reveal the reason for the house's abandonment and the terrible experiences of many of the island's other British colonials when they were imprisoned in a Japanese internment camp during WWII. These are not Flora's experiences, but she is the same age as many of the children on the island who were born in the camp, and the community is haunted by this shared and secret past. <br /> <br />OTHER ECHOES is about a long vanished time, and yet it doesn't fall completely into the category of historical fiction. Most of the action dwells within the experiences of people who are still living. The world has changed enough in fifty years to make many parts of Flora's world seem quaint or alien. Some examples include the pervasiveness of hats and dresses, or the realization that sunscreen was not widely available until the late 1970s. Other parts jolt us into the uncomfortable realization that some things are not quite as safe in the past as we might like them to be. A passage in which Flora speaks of the two household servants who live with her family in Borneo is particularly uncomfortable: <br /> <br />\\"We called them Amah and Cook. I was nearly ten, and I called two adults older even than my parents by the name that went with the work they did. I am ashamed now. I want to call them, wherever they are, and shout out: 'I'm sorry. I meant no disrespect.' It is only now that I realize that not calling people by their proper names is the beginning, and by the end one group of people can say of another: you are not like us, you are inferior to us, you are not human beings at all.\\" <br /> <br />Adle Geras does not make a direct correlation between the ways in which the British colonials treat their household \\"help,\\" the bullying of the children, or the horrors of the internment camp. And yet all the pieces of the puzzle are present in OTHER ECHOES waiting to be assembled both by Flora and the reader. Like many of Adle Geras's previous books, OTHER ECHOES has nuance, insight and complexity. I am grateful that this book (originally published in 1982) is back in print so I could have a chance to read it. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Sarah A. Wood <br />	2005-04-18

Sonny knows Alberto is involved with something illegal, but rather than try to stop Alberto, he's intrigued with his friend's new secrecy and possessions. After all, the criminals in Medelln have better lives than everyone else. They have money and power and they know they're in control. Sonny, following Alberto's lead, convinces El Fantasma to take him on as an employee, specifically an assassin.

A morsel of the sweetness can lift our spirits and put a smile on our faces. Joe Beck is obsessed with Candy. But Joe's Candy is not a confection. Candy is a girl. And she is not your average teen. Candy holds secrets and lives a dark world. Little does Joe know, but once he becomes entrapped in Candy's world, his life will never be the same. <br /> <br />In the opening pages of CANDY, Joe muses: \\"It's hard to imagine life before Candy. Sometimes I sit here for hours, staring into the past, trying to remember what it was like, but I never seem to get very far. I just can't see myself without her. About the best I can manage is the last half hour before we met, the last few moments of my pre-Candy existence, when I was still just a boy. I was innocent then.\\" <br /> <br />Joe is pretty much what one would call an \\"average Joe.\\" He's a high school student from the suburbs of London. He's not exceptional at school, but he gets by. Plus, he has his music. Joe plays guitar in a band, The Katies, with some boys from school. They play in clubs, sometimes even in London clubs. Joe's parents are divorced and he lives with his father and older sister, Gina. Joe is still trying to figure out who he is and where he will go in the world. Maybe that's why he is so easily drawn in to Candy. <br /> <br />Joe first meets Candy when he goes to London for a doctor's appointment. She's standing outside of a drugstore and she notices him. \\"Nice hat,\\" she says. Joe is wearing a new wool hat with a star on it. He stands motionless, shocked that this beautiful girl he had been staring at has spoken to him. She disappears as he tries to muster up the nerve to say something in return. Then fate strikes again. Joe runs into the same girl in McDonald's, and she helps him out of an embarrassing situation. As a thank you, Joe buys her a chocolate donut. The girl tells him her name is Candy. <br /> <br />Joe and Candy are enjoying their time in McDonald's until a dark shadow is cast over the table. It's a huge guy who sits down between them. He has \\"the emptiest eyes I've ever seen --- empty of feeling, empty of hearing, empty of everything but himself. His face was a death mask.\\" His name is Iggy, and Candy is obviously very, very afraid. Iggy knows Candy, and he has control over her. She won't look at Joe with Iggy there, and Iggy does not want Joe around. \\"I see you again,\\" he says, \\"you'll be smiling to the bone.\\" <br /> <br />The first encounter with Candy has been both thrilling and frightening for Joe, but when he finds Candy's phone number slipped into his pocket, he knows that he has to see her again. <br /> <br />Kevin Brooks is the critically acclaimed author of MARTYN PIG, KISSING THE RAIN, and LUCAS. His fourth novel, CANDY, is as captivating and entertaining as his previous books. CANDY is a thriller, a romance, and a coming-of-age tale all mixed into one book. Brooks's words are cleverly crafted and make for a haunting story about what happens when an average Joe falls for a girl from the wrong side of the tracks. Amidst the danger and the fear, Joe has to put everything that is important in his own life on the line in order to save Candy from herself. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Kristi Olson (zooey24@yahoo.com)	2005-04-18

Someone in a blue letterman's jacket bashes in the windshield of Alex's car with a baseball bat, injuring Alex in the attack. Daria Bickell, special ed student, sees Clinton at the scene. The answer is obvious: Clinton attacked Alex. <br /> <br />At least, the answer seems obvious. <br /> <br />As Alex, Clinton and Daria tell the story of the attack from their own points of view, we learn more about the events leading up to the attack and how their lives change after it. Alex makes the acquaintance of Jennifer, who turns out to be his friend for all the wrong reasons. He also decides to come clean about two major cover-ups in his life. Clinton faces trouble at home as well as at school. Daria, caught between what she knows and wanting to please her mother, reveals her side slowly, always concerned with doing the right thing. <br /> <br />As the saying goes, \\"There are two sides to every story, and somewhere in between, there is the truth.\\" In this case, there are three sides to the story, and they're all handled very well.

Books intended for older teens are frequently read by younger readers, while older teens often do not read young adult literature at all. Michael Cart's RUSH HOUR: A JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY VOICES has sought to address the challenge of an older teen readership by presenting edgy fiction, essays, and poetry with mature themes. The two previous offerings featured the themes of \\"Sin\\" and \\"Bad Boys\\" with stories about individuals in their teens. Volume 3 differs from the first two volumes in that it contains a large number of stories about young adults who are out of their teens, out of high school, and in some cases, even out of college. <br /> <br />Some readers may question the choice to feature so many protagonists who are well out of their teens. Will a teen readership understand what it is like to be someone out of college attending the wedding of an ex-girlfriend, like the protagonist of Blake Nelson's \\"Ceremony\\"? What about the challenges of finding meaningful employment, like the main character in the opening story, \\"Turning Japanese\\" by David Yoo? Or watching the decline and decay of people who were once the center of one's life as in Lara Zeises's \\"Me and the Bean,\\" a reverie looking back at a young woman's high school relationship with a boy who grew up to become a drug addict? <br /> <br />Psychologists surmise that in contemporary American culture, adolescence extends to the age of 27. The best offerings in FACE seek to bridge the spectrum between teens and twenties. The most striking offering in the collection is Eric Shanowar's \\"Behind the Lines,\\" a story told in graphic novel format about a girl whose mother gets a youth treatment that not only removes the lines from her face, but also erases the experiences that brought about maturity. It is engaging and spooky, a meditation on what we lose when our culture becomes obsessed with youth and disdains maturity. The graphic format makes the idea of vanishing identity a powerful visual metaphor. <br /> <br />The two nonfiction essays about identity are also interesting, if somewhat incomplete. \\"A Hole New Primitive World\\" by Kelly Milner Halls is about the \\"modern primitive\\" movement in body art and piercing. The essay offers a lot in terms of individual experiences without getting into frequently asked questions on the topic or the long-term ramifications of body modification. <br /> <br />Body modification of a different sort is discussed in Claibourne Smith's \\"The Wrong Body.\\" The essay is about transsexuals, people who believe they were born the wrong gender, and face years of humiliation and painful operations in order to transition to their true identity. \\"The Wrong Body\\" clarifies some common misconceptions about transsexuals, including the difference between them and cross-dressers, and the difficulty faced by many transsexuals by being lumped with the GLBT (Gay Lesbian Bi Transsexual) movement that does not necessarily accept them. <br /> <br />This volume itself seems to be struggling with what face it will present to the world. What is the median age of their intended readership? Would that readership prefer to read about teens or people in their twenties? Is it dark and edgy, or funny and hip? Does it seek to offer a consistent tone, or does it intentionally offer a variety of different stories and styles? As this is only the third issue of the journal, it seems too early to judge. The only certainty is that the publication is provocative and worth reading, even as I hope the editor seeks to infuse RUSH HOUR's edgy realism with stories that contain more humor and hope. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Sarah A.

One evening, Jackie shows Grace old family photos. Grace sees one that puzzles her: Next to Grace's young mother stands a man with a birthmark identical to Grace's own --- a small light hand above the heart. Grace can't tell from the photo, but she wonders if he might also have the thick red hair that only she has. When asked about the man, Jackie and Ma claim not to know who he is. <br /> <br />Grace's mother has always explained her birthmark by saying an angel touched Grace there when she was a tiny baby. Grace remembers how angry her father got over the angel story. Suddenly she wonders: could the stranger in the picture somehow actually be her real father? It might explain why Grace has always felt so very apart from the rest of her family. But how could that be? She realizes that she must discover more about the stranger --- and possibly uncover the truth about herself. <br /> <br />Grace confides her secret suspicions to Raj, who proves to be sympathetic and helpful. He suggests Grace and Sally invite their parents' old friends to the party they're planning when their parents come for them.

Now, Trueman gives Shawn's older brother Paul a voice in the companion novel CRUISE CONTROL. <br /> <br />Paul is pretty much the polar opposite of Shawn: he is popular, gifted, a jock who can trust his body to perform at the highest level. He's also deeply angry, with a quick temper and a tendency to fly off the handle. Much of Paul's anger is directed at his father, a writer who wrote a Pulitzer Prize-winning poem about Shawn after he left the family, and now seems to use Shawn mostly for photo ops and talk show appearances. Paul, who deeply loves his brother (even though he calls him a \\"veg\\"), resents his father for abandoning him and for escaping the day-to-day realities of living with a profoundly disabled family member. <br /> <br />CRUISE CONTROL is sometimes a disturbing book, as when the reader is taken into Paul's head as he beats up a complete stranger, or when Paul and his equally angry friend Tim drive drunk. Although STUCK IN NEUTRAL was perhaps a more powerful book, in part because of its unusual and surprising narrator, CRUISE CONTROL is still a complex and moving portrayal, even with its more conventional main character. Although each novel can stand on its own merits, STUCK IN NEUTRAL and CRUISE CONTROL gain strength when read together, as they form a more complete portrait of a family dealing with the daily heartbreak of Shawn's disability. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl	2004-12-10

I first encountered ANDY WARHOL: PRINCE OF POP as an excerpt in RUSH HOUR: Volume Two - Bad Boys. The excerpt, covering the central controversial period of Warhol's celebrity in the 1960s, excited me so much that I knew I had to read more. <br /> <br />The rest of the biography does not disappoint. Organized in a linear narrative, the book covers Warhol's life, from his early childhood as the sickly child of Eastern European immigrants to his death at the age of 58 of complications after routine surgery. It organizes each period into thematic chapters filled with interesting anecdotes, pithy Warhol aphorisms, and memories from people who were there at the time. <br /> <br />Jan Greenberg and Sandra Jordan's extensive knowledge of the subject and in-depth research into Warhol's life make this book a treasure. It includes a timeline, a glossary of unfamiliar art terms, an extensive bibliography of sources, and is heavily illustrated with some of Warhol's most famous works. While intended as a biography for young adults, this book makes Warhol's life, work, and the art of his age accessible in a way that will appeal to readers of all ages. <br /> <br />One of the strongest aspects of the book is the authors' understanding and clear explanations of many of the art movements of the twentieth century. Also invaluable is the authors' illumination of the many processes Warhol used to produce his art, including painting, silk-screening, and experimental film. <br /> <br />It is difficult for biographers to avoid the trap of finding greatness in the origins of their subjects. This book contains many stories about the Warhol being drawn to art at an early age. However, the authors' careful plotting of the transformation of a shy and painfully awkward boy into the international celebrity also suggests that one of Andy's greatest creations was his own image as an artist. <br /> <br />ANDY WARHOL: PRINCE OF POP does not shy away from the racy subject matter of Warhol's experimental films or the raucous entourage he incorporated into his work in the 1960s. It also deals extensively, though not explicitly, with Warhol's homosexuality. <br /> <br />The work of Andy Warhol is so influential that even readers who do not know anything about him will probably recognize his famous paintings of Campbell soup cans, or his celebrity portraits silk-screened onto brightly colored backgrounds. Greenberg and Jordan's book is engaging and thought-provoking. It will undoubtedly set the standard for young adult biographies for years to come. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Sarah A.

I pulled it out of my bag to read on the El, which was going from Washington to Jefferson Park, and I became so absorbed in Steve Nugent's story that I almost missed my stop. But that is what Adam Rapp does best: tell stories that are at once despairing, brutal, true, and hopeful. <br /> <br />Like THE CATCHER IN THE RYE, this is a retrospective story told by a resident of a mental (and, in this case, drug rehab) institution, but Steve has been through a lot more than just getting kicked out of boarding school. Steve is a Gray Grouper at Burnstone Grove, neither a drug addict nor suicidal, but someone who cracked slowly under too many stresses. He lost his mother, and then his brother; through these deaths, when Steve needed him the most, his father became more distant. <br /> <br />With an unapologetic eye for detail, Rapp takes us through Steve's discovery of his brother's dead body and the crimes he commits afterwards. Instead of revulsion, we as readers feel sympathy for Steve, who is as sensitive and captivating as he is observant and honest, a good person in a series of bad situations. The supporting characters --- including Mary, the beautiful pianist Steve has a crush on, and Shannon Lynch, a manipulative resident of Burnstone Grove who can put $1.87 in change up his nose --- add color and dimension to Steve's experiences. <br /> <br />There is humor here for those who need to laugh in the most difficult situations and hope for those who need some kind of happy ending.

Instead, it gives the girl debilitating pain and a life-threatening infection. <br /> <br />While her stepsister heals, Xing Xing becomes the family servant, dressed in rags and only secretly practicing the \\"three perfections\\" --- painting, poetry, and calligraphy --- which her father had valued and helped cultivate in her. Xing Xing loves to learn, but adults in her society discourage it, saying that \\"lack of talent in a woman is a virtue.\\" As Xing Xing attempts to practice her art and evade her evil Stepmother, she finds solace from an unexpected source --- a giant fish who may be the spirit of her late mother. <br /> <br />Napoli's story bears a general resemblance both to traditional Western Cinderella stories and to the much older Chinese Cinderella tales. By placing her story in a specific time and place, Napoli also introduces historical details and themes about the value of women, which add depth to the tale. All the familiar elements are here: the cruel stepmother, the stepsister (who here is not really evil, just needy), the fancy dress, the lost shoe, and the prince. What may be surprising is why Xing Xing seeks to marry the prince --- rather than romance, prestige, or the love of fine things, Xing Xing seeks a royal marriage because it may be her only chance to grow into a strong, accomplished, and independent woman. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl	2004-12-10

You're too old to cry and too young to swear, and you don't even have much of a life to go flashing past.\\" This sets the tone for the collection of short stories about the life and adventures of Norman Tuttle, eldest son of an Alaskan fisherman, as he faces the challenges of growing up. <br /> <br />NORMAN TUTTLE ON THE LAST FRONTIER is a hilarious account of a boy growing up on the last frontiers of civilization and adolescence. Some tales are unique to the setting, like those about Norman helping on his father's fishing boat. Others are common to young people anywhere in North America, such as the stories about bullies, friendship, or first loves. <br /> <br />Tom Bodett makes an unusual choice in placing Norman in a loving, two-parent home. His close relationship with his father is especially noteworthy. Most young people in literature come from families that are missing a parent or experiencing some sort of trauma, such as a recent death or alcoholism. NORMAN TUTTLE ON THE LAST FRONTIER proves that there is plenty of drama available in a young person's life without resorting to trauma. The strongest stories in this collection are pitch-perfect renderings of perfectly mundane moments in a young person's life. <br /> <br />There are two standout stories in this collection of humorous tales. \\"Thanksgiving Cheer\\" is about the first Thanksgiving when Norman is allowed to sit at the grown-up table. Sent to the basement to look after his younger siblings and cousins, Norman ends up pounding a screwdriver into his father's workbench. His father, unaware that Norman has disobeyed one of the cardinal rules of the house --- to stay out of the tools --- invites Norman to join the adults. Norman knows he should enjoy being included as an adult member of the family, but all he can think about is how to repair the damage in the basement before his parents find out. <br /> <br />Another great story is \\"A Bump in the Road.\\" Norman, who is recently grounded and seething against the unfairness of the world, reacts to his father's annoying tendency to say, \\"Bumpity-bump-bump-bump!\\" whenever they hit a rough spot on the road. The simple set-up and Bodett's direct use of language make the story an ideal way to explore the dynamics and feelings behind adolescent outbursts. <br /> <br />Never condescending, NORMAN TUTTLE ON THE LAST FRONTIER can be enjoyed both by people experiencing these things for the first time and those who remember going through them. In a world full of teen trauma novels, this book is a refreshing breath of positive realism. I look forward to what Tom Bodett will offer next. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Sarah A.

The year is A.D. 793. He can expect to be sold into slavery, or to serve his kidnappers for the rest of his life. He can expect never to see his home in Saxon Britain again. What he does not expect is the magical adventure that will take him into the hearts and minds of his captors, and ultimately to the roots of the world tree Yggdrasil. <br /> <br />Three-time Newbery Honor author Nancy Farmer weaves together history, humor and Norse mythology to create a marvelous tale of action and adventure. Only an author as masterful and imaginative as Farmer would be able to adapt the story of Beowolf for young people. Or show the human side of berserkers, warriors who take drugs that transform them into frenzied killers immune to pain and exhaustion. <br /> <br />Jack struggles with his role as slave to his captor, the fierce and funny Olaf One-Brow. He also grapples with the worldview of the Northmen, which glorifies violence and death in battle. His duties as Olaf's skald (poet/bard) require him to witness the slaughter of villages and turn them into songs of praise. Still, he is able to find courage, honor and beauty among his harsh circumstances. It is the experience of these virtues that he finds the will to live. <br /> <br />THE SEA OF TROLLS is full of surprising twists and turns, along with a depth not always found in adventure novels. It is also extremely well researched. Farmer includes a bibliography of source materials for readers who want to learn more about Norse culture. There are very few books, fiction or nonfiction, available to young people on the subject. By utilizing such a rich tradition, Farmer has created a highly original work. It is a joy to read, and I hope it will bring her the Newbery Award she so richly deserves. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Sarah A. Wood <br /> <br />	2004-12-10

Philip Reeve introduced \\"Municipal Darwinism\\" in his first book MORTAL ENGINES, in which traction cities roll about the earth looking for smaller, weaker cities to devour. He also introduced the series' protagonists: Hester, a scavenger who has lived her life largely outside the bounds of the enormous rolling cities, and Tom, an apprentice historian. <br /> <br />PREDATOR'S GOLD follows the continuing adventures of Hester and Tom, who have taken charge of the Jenny Haniver, an airship belonging to legendary aeronaut Anna Fang. They have spent the past few years traveling the \\"birdroads,\\" taking on passengers and cargo to earn their living. <br /> <br />Their peace is short-lived when a new, radical wing of the Anti-Traction League (a rebel group dedicated to the idea that cities should become stationary again) tries to reclaim the airship for their own uses. Shot down and desperately in need of repairs, Hester and Tom land on the sparsely populated city of Anchorage, which is under the new leadership of Freya, a spoiled margravine whose parents died in an engineered plague. Freya, enamored of the tales of a lush, green paradise, as reported in the preposterous books of Prof. Pennyroyal, has directed her city towards the Dead Continent, across the uncharted ice of the arctic. <br /> <br />Things take a turn for the disastrous when Hester, jealous of Tom's affection for Anchorage and the beautiful, plump margravine, commits an act of betrayal that sets off an explosive series of events. Murder, intrigue and resurrection of the dead steer the book toward an exciting conclusion. <br /> <br />Those who enjoyed MORTAL ENGINES will not be disappointed. Having established \\"Municipal Darwinism\\" in his first book, Reeve is now free to explore and expand upon the idea. There is less violence in PREDATOR'S GOLD, but the book remains full of action and has several new imaginative twists. Among them are the \\"Lost Boys,\\" a group of parasitic thieves who attach themselves to unsuspecting cities and plunder them in secret. Despite a name that suggests Peter Pan's Neverland, the Lost Boys and their greedy Uncle have more in common with Fagin's gang of boy thieves in Oliver Twist, and are ruled by manipulation and cruelty. <br /> <br />Also reappearing are the Resurrection Men, machines made using the bodies of the dead. While these horrifying machine men, and the fact that most cities are dependent upon poorly treated slaves, would suggest a moral agenda, one of the most fascinating aspects of the Hungry City Chronicles is that Reeve does not involve his main characters in politics or rebellion. Hester and Tom find themselves involved in their adventures accidentally, or because of personal reasons. Where most authors would be likely to be sympathetic toward the aims and ends of the Anti-Traction League, Reeve has instead created the militant Green Storm, who will stoop to terrorism to achieve their ends. <br /> <br />The Hungry City Chronicles contains a lot of moral ambiguity and offers some excellent chances to explore the pros and cons of technology, and societal structures. The ending of PREDATOR'S GOLD leaves some intriguing possibilities for the following book in the series, already titled INFERNAL MACHINES. It is set for release in the UK next spring. Sadly, those of us living on the Dead Continent will have to wait another year before we find out what happens next. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Sarah A. Wood <br />	2004-12-10

Their men do their bidding now with knives and guns and bombs just like all criminals, but the Dragon has a special place in his heart for fire. They simply love fire, and can never get enough of it...\\" <br /> <br />Unlike the dragon in Christopher Paolini's ERAGON, the dragons in THE SAINT OF DRAGONS by Jason Hightman are very evil. They are not only bad, but they also have assumed certain human characteristics to help them blend into today's world. Therefore, trying to find them is not always an easy task. The last Knight of the Order of Dragonhunters, Aldric St. George, is determined to find the last dragon and save the world from its fearful hold. In order to do this, Aldric seeks out the son he had to abandon over 11 years ago. <br /> <br />Simon has no idea that he has \\"Dragonhunter\\" blood or that the poor-looking man who shows up at his boarding school, where he lives with the kindly lighthouse keeper and his wife, is really his father. As events unfold and Simon is caught up in a wild and dangerous adventure, he learns a great deal about both himself and the man he now calls \\"father.\\" Simon tries to prove time and again that he is a warrior, only to place them in even more dangerous situations. In the end, however, it is Simon's trust, wits and cleverness that help save them. Simon St. George proves to be a true Dragonhunter after all. <br /> <br />The lovely Alaythia, who has magical abilities and is able to understand the dragon runes, shares their adventures. She also plays a major part in helping to fight the infestation of dragons, and eventually she lives with them --- continuing to study and hope for a way to communicate with the good dragons that might be left. <br /> <br />While all the dragons we meet in this story are truly evil, there is one dragon, the Black Dragon, who is won over by Simon's good heart. This powerful and ancient Black Dragon is the hope that somehow good dragons can once again be part of man's world. The exciting conclusion leads us to long for another grand adventure. Readers will be delighted to know that Hightman has more stories on the way.

It is about Aly, daughter of the legendary Lady Knight Alanna, who was captured by pirates and sold into slavery on the Copper Isles. Aly has made an uneasy alliance with Kyprioth, the islands' trickster god, who has asked her to protect the two daughters of the Balitang family. <br /> <br />In TRICKSTER'S QUEEN Aly returns to the capital of the Copper Isles with the Balitang family. The capital is seething with unrest, as the raka natives are subjected to the increasingly oppressive rule of the luarin colonists. Aly finds herself deeply involved with the resistance, who plan to return the rightful queen to her throne. <br /> <br />Readers who love fantasy intrigue and adventure will enjoy this series. TRICKSTER'S QUEEN features the return of several intriguing characters from the first book, including Nawat the crow. It also introduces lots of new ones, including darkings creatures made of \\"magic and blood\\" who share a collective consciousness. The darkings not only provide a distraction from many of the book's darker events, they also serve as a spy network and a plot device to gather information and further the story. <br /> <br />Rebellion features prominently in many works of fiction for children and young adults. Perhaps this is because young people are struggling to build their own identities, and relate with strongly idealistic movements. Fantasy almost always incorporates a theme of resistance, whether it is against a corrupt monarchy or the forces of darkness. <br /> <br />Pierce's book only briefly touches on the blood price of rebellion, and her characters are not corruptible. The good guys stay good, and the bad guys are easily identifiable. The only fickle characters are the gods. It is an extremely moral universe.

In Deborah Noyes's introduction to GOTHIC!: Ten Original Dark Tales, she explains: \\"It's probably more accurate to think of gothic as a room within the larger house of horror. Its decor is distinctive. It insists on burden of the past. It also gleefully turns our ideas of good and evil on end.\\" <br /> <br />GOTHIC! contains more than a collection of the classic gothic tale, however. Although some stories maintain the classic gothic story, we also find more contemporary tales that are both dark and sometimes even humorous. The cast of authors includes: Joan Aiken, Vivian Vande Velde, M.T. Anderson, Neil Gaiman, Caitlin R. Kiernan, Barry Yourgrau, Janni Lee Simmer, Gregory Maguire, Celia Rees, and Garth Nix. <br /> <br />There are several stories that stand out in this dark collection. Among them are Neil Gaiman's \\"Forbidden Brides of the Faceless Slaves in the Nameless House of the Night of Dread Desire.\\" Gaiman is well known for his eerie graphic novels, and most recently the children's book CORALINE. As a fan of the gothic structure, Gaiman tips his hat to the traditional tale and leaves the reader questioning. <br /> <br />Also of note is Barry Yourgrau's \\"Have No Fear, Crumpot is Here!\\" which masterfully mixes humor and horror. The main character of the tale is a troublesome teen named Walter, who is to spend one week during the summer with his parents' friends. His parents, who are away on a business conference, want Walter to learn to \\"demonstrate responsibility.\\" Walter is in an angsty world of his own where he has invented a ruthless alter ego named Crumpot. But not even Crumpot is prepared for what is in store! <br /> <br />Gregory Maguire's \\"The Prank\\" is another story that stands out from the pack. Maguire is widely known for his new renderings of the traditional fairy tales as he shows in his popular books WICKED and MIRROR MIRROR. Similar to Yourgrau's Walter character, Maguire introduces us to an equally angsty teen, Melanie, who has been sent away to live with her great aunt. Melanie has been in trouble at home and her smart alecky attitude is not getting her far with her great aunt.

Volume two does not pack the same punch as the first, but it does have a number of intriguing offerings. <br /> <br />While there are a number of provocative short stories in this volume, the stand out contributions are both nonfiction. \\"Andy Warhol: Prince of Pop,\\" excerpted from a newly released biography by Jan Greenberg and Sandra Jordan, stretches the definition of bad boy to include the notorious leading figure of the pop art movement. While an iconoclastic, homosexual artist is not an obvious choice for the role of bad boy, Greenberg and Jordan do a wonderful job evoking the sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll world that revolved around him. They also clearly explain the principles behind the pop art movement, which is no easy task. Additionally, the two authors explore Warhol's background and inspirations, including a cross-country road trip Andy spent lounging ona mattress in the back of a beat-up Ford Station wagon gazing at billboards. The excerpt reads like a complete essay. Instead of leaving the reader hanging, it covers the central, controversial period of Warhol's celebrity, ending after he is shot by Valerie Solanas. <br /> <br />The second standout essay is \\"Surviving Jock Culture\\" by Robert Lipsyte, a New York Times sportswriter and the author of a number of critically acclaimed YA novels. There are many articles that criticize the United States' sports obsessed culture, but Lipsyte's essay is unique in its love for athletics, while clearly defining the unhealthy mindset that distorts sports and many athletes. Using Mike Tyson as a case study, Lipsyte explores the intimidation and abuse that create monsters, while simultaneously making them victims of Jock Culture. Lipsyte closes the essay with the following: <br /> <br />\\"Even if you're an athlete, you don't have to roll over for Jock Culture; you're supposed to be tough, but that doesn't only mean the easy stuff like lifting more weight and hitting harder, always trying to dominate and win. It also means facing challenging situations and making hard decisions, sometimes going against the crowd and not listening to what you know is bad advice, even if it comes from the coach. It means being a man.\\" <br /> <br />Much of the volume seems geared around the line between boyhood and maturity. It contains stories of bad boys from different points of view: from the boys themselves, as in E.R. Frank's \\"Cousins,\\" to brothers or victims, as in the intriguing excerpt from VANDAL, a forthcoming novel by Michael Simmons. One of the most enigmatic pieces is \\"Nursery\\" by Julia Jarcho, a piece in play format meditating on the subject of school shootings. However, one essential narrative is missing from this Bad Boy volume: the experience of girls with bad boys. It seems strange to find female protagonists missing from a volume that broadly represents female authors. This absenceleft me wanting more. <br /> <br />While not as polished as the first volume, BAD BOYS continues to take the publication in the right direction. The best new addition is some humorous artwork, which provides much needed levity between some of the more serious stories. The question isn't whether or not there is material within the pages for bad boy readers; there are clearly some excellent contributions to the field of YA lit. The question is whether or not the publication will hit its mark. I hope it does. As Jack Gantos ends his foreword, \\"I wouldn't mind bleeding a little bit if that would get them to read...\\" <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Sarah A. Wood	2004-10-22

Margaux, by far the best-looking girl in her class, smart and witty, knows this \\"secret stuff\\" at an early age. She and her father share a dark secret. Her father is good-looking and funny, but is always the con artist and spends his life gambling --- sometimes he wins, sometimes he doesn't. Then there is her mother, locked in her own world of TV shopping, getting her nails done, and sharing her husband's excitement at the racetracks. So while Margaux makes the good grades, dates one boy after another and hangs out with her shallow friends, she is lonelier and angrier than anyone could ever know. <br /> <br />Danny Riley is a walking resale shop. His clothes are too big; he has a plain face and a manner about him that says he just doesn't care what other people think. Danny has his secrets too --- the father who beat him, the aunt who saved him (he hopes) and the devotion to the humane society where he volunteers. Danny is not considered \\"cool\\" by his peers and is, in fact, an outsider simply by the way he dresses. <br /> <br />Like Ron Koertge's STONER & SPAZ, Danny and Margaux are a little oil and water. They come together with an unexpected attraction, which at first totally confuses Margaux: <br /> <br />\\"...Margaux looks for Danny/is afraid he's looking for her/wants to see him/wants to avoid him/wonders why he hasn't sought her out/is afraid he will. Really, what can she be thinking; that uncomely face, the spindle-shanked meagerness of him, the teakettle thinness of his breath. His daunting goodness.\\" <br /> <br />As the relationship develops, Margaux meets Danny's aunt Evie, who suffers from debilitating MS. Margaux also meets the darker Danny --- the Danny who is his father. But out of the chaos in both of their lives, they are pulled together and Margaux does not run from the opportunity to learn from Danny and his wise aunt. <br /> <br />Koertge is a master at exploring teens on the edge. Like Paulsen, Cormier and Brooks, Koertge gives us sharp, insightful glimpses into some darker aspects of adolescents and their lives. Teens will be attracted to these unusual characters and a well-paced story. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Sally M. Tibbetts (stibbetts@maine207west.k12.il.us)	2004-10-22

He's actually a \\"cool hunter\\" --- a Trendsetter whose job is to find \\"the latest thing\\" and make it a must-have for everyone. He meets Jen, a true Innovator (defined as the first person to do something totally new) when she dazzles him with her stylishly tied shoelaces. Hunter takes Jen to a focus group to watch a shoe commercial, where she gives such startlingly insightful comments that Hunter's boss, Mandy, asks them both to meet her in Chinatown to consult on a big deal. <br /> <br />Mandy doesn't meet Hunter and Jen, although they can hear her phone ringing ominously inside an abandoned building. The two make like action heroes (but bungling believably and humorously) to get into the building. Inside it's dark, but using the light from Hunter's cell phone, they find Mandy's phone, the most amazing shoes ever made --- and a frightening bald man who chases them. During their escape, Hunter loses his own phone. <br /> <br />So what's become of Mandy? The last picture taken on her phone is dark and blurry, and potentially horrible. Luckily Hunter's friend is a special effects computer expert. As they're deciphering the photo, Mandy's phone rings...and it's the sinister guy who chased them earlier. He has Hunter's phone and he may be a killer. How long will it be before he tracks down Hunter? <br /> <br />The action nabs readers instantly and tumbles them along. Hunter's biting and hysterical cultural insights invite serious contemplation (you may never look at a magazine or a logo the same way!) Characters are quirky and believable --- you have to love a main character who calls the public library's reference desk to learn how to tie a bow tie and can also discourse entertainingly on the history of the necktie. Add into the mix a bit of romance that manages to be simultaneously subtle and steamy. <br /> <br />In this story, if a trend is astoundingly original and hip, cool hunters give it the Nod.

It may appear to be poor farms divided by families whose lineages go back several generations. Each family, however, has a powerful gift that is unique to them. Depending on how these gifts work, though --- whether in healing or in violence --- is the key to the survival of each family. This is an important factor that best friends Orrec and Gry have known all their lives. <br /> <br />Orrec's father is Canoc, the Brantor of Caspromant. A brantor is the master or mistress of a domain and the most gifted of a lineage. His mother is Melle Aulitta from Derris Water of the Lowlands. The Caspro gift is called the undoing and, despite the fact that his mother does not have a powerful gift of her own, Orrec seems to be destined for greatness. However, as with any powerful gift, this one has its own set of pros and cons. <br /> <br />When Orrec is a young child, he witnesses his father using his gift on a trapped rat in a half-filled rain barrel and its shapeless result. Canoc has his young son try to practice his gift by untying a knot of horse hair, but being not yet six, Orrec is unable to complete the task. Canoc reassures his son that he'll develop his own power soon and tells him the story of the Blind Caddard. The Blind Caddard was an ancestor who first came into his gift at the age of three and after some time was blindfolded for three years as a precaution against misusing his gift. He learned well and, when he was older, progressed into one of the most powerful brantors of all time. <br /> <br />Canoc then tells his son of when Caddard became blind. He lost control and, in a rage of anger, destroyed a serving girl and his wife. Devastated, Caddard permanently blinds himself to prevent a similar tragedy from ever happening again. For the rest of his life, the Blind Caddard lived with cattle herders far away from his former domain. Needless to say, the story leaves a lasting impression on Orrec. <br /><br />Years go by, and Orrec and his best friend Gry are now thirteen. Gry has the Barres gift of calling animals both for work and in a hunt. Her mother is the Brantor of the Barres of Roddmant and her father is the Brantor of the Rodds of that domain. Unfortunately, for a worried Orrec, the Caspro gift has yet to appear. That seems to change, however, when Orrec appears to kill a snake with the gift while out riding with his father and a young farmer named Alloc. <br /> <br />Orrec is convinced that he didn't kill the snake and that his father did it in order to build up Orrec's confidence. Canoc denies ever killing the snake and Orrec feels the pressure to succeed overwhelming. His father reassures him that he will have his gift soon and lets the matter drop once again. Several days go by and Orrec's family is visited by Canoc's rival, Brantor Ogge of Drummant. Drum's offer of a betrothal between his granddaughter and Orrec foreshadows many great changes to come. <br /> <br />One morning, during another riding excursion with Canoc and Alloc, Orrec's gift seems to appear once again. This time Orrec accidentally destroys his dog Hamneda, after the dog breaks from his leash and scares Orrec's horse. Canoc and Alloc are now even more convinced that Orrec killed the dog and the snake, but Orrec doesn't think he's capable of doing so because he didn't feel the power go through him. Tired of the situation and his son's refusal to willfully use his gift, Canoc decides to take his son out to test him the next morning. <br /> <br />While looking for two prized white heifers stolen from their domain, Orrec is asked what he already knows is expected of him. He feels he won't be able to show his power at will, but tries again anyway. Orrec wills his dormant power to unmake an anthill that he sees along a hillside. When nothing happens, he becomes very frustrated and is on the brink of giving up. What happens next horrifies Orrec, and he decides to have his father blindfold him like Caddard was. <br /> <br />So begins a new chapter in Orrec's life, in which he must rely on his family, friends and a loyal guide dog named Coaly. He soon becomes accustomed to the newfound darkness, but when tragedy falls upon his mother, everything changes once again. Orrec wants to protect those he loves but knows that he can't always do this. When a shocking revelation is brought to light, Orrec realizes that, in the end, he must believe in himself as well. <br /> <br />GIFTS is a well-written fantasy with many modern-day themes, one of which is that in order to overcome obstacles and accomplish great things, you must first believe in yourself. The frequent flashbacks in the beginning of the story made the book slightly difficult to read in some areas, but it was definitely worth it in the end. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Sarah Sawtelle (SdarksideG@aol.com)	2004-09-17

Back then, they had both been fighting the darkness that threatened to consume the town of Dark Springs, Massachusetts. That was before Livvy decided to turn toward the darkness and become a vampire --- while taking Ross, Destiny's long-time crush, along for the ride and breaking the strong foundation of their family as well.<br /><br />Destiny has since tried to move on and make a new life for herself and her family. She and her friends, Ana-Li and Ari Stark, have recently graduated from high school and are preparing to head off to college. Everyone is excited about the prospect of beginning a new chapter in their lives. For Destiny, however, this is not exactly the case; she has to stay in Dark Springs to keep her family together. Her little brother Mikey has begun to hallucinate and her father, Dr. Weller, is still nowhere closer to finding a cure for vampirism.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Livvy is thriving in the nightlife and doesn't care to go back to what she considers to be her boring old life. Along with her new friends, Monica and Suzie, Livvy loves going out each night to party with hot guys --- the same hot guys whom they love to feed on, especially under a full moon. One night, when Monica mentions that there was a graduation ceremony at the twins' high school earlier that day, Livvy becomes defensive, but nonetheless decides to have a graduation party of her own and suggests that they go to the new club, Rip, to celebrate and feed.<br /><br />Destiny and Ari also decide to go to the club, where most of their friends and classmates are celebrating. They have recently begun dating, but Destiny feels awkward about Ari's changing personality due to the incident with Livvy and Ross. This is made even more apparent when Ari accuses Destiny of being too serious, and the young couple gets into an argument. Destiny becomes angry when she sees Ari dancing with a beautiful red-haired girl and leaves the club. Little does she know the twist of fate that lies ahead.<br /><br />Livvy is hanging out by the bar in Rip, on the prowl for a hot guy to cure the edge of hunger that she constantly feels. It seems as though this could be her lucky night when she meets a handsome college student named Patrick. The two flirt, and Livvy goes outside for a smoke while waiting for Patrick to meet up with her. Destiny sees Livvy and begs her to come back home. Livvy threatens to turn her twin sister into a vampire, but lets a frightened and confused Destiny go.<br /><br />Afterwards, Livvy sees Patrick and lures him into the woods surrounding the parking lot of the club. The moonlight is bright and there's excitement in the air, perfect for a vampire and her prey. Livvy realizes that she is truly attracted to Patrick and the couple passionately kisses. Hunger soon overtakes Livvy and she goes in for the kill, but to her horror, she finds out that Patrick is a vampire who wants to change things around Dark Springs. Patrick soon leaves a very confused Livvy, who is hungrier than before and realizes that she hasn't seen the last of the mysterious vampire.<br /><br />The next day, Destiny drops off her little brother at day camp and begins her new job at the Four Corners Diner. Two of Destiny's old friends are customers there, and she tries to talk to them about their summer as she give them their menus. The friends feel awkward when they ask about Destiny's future plans, and Livvy and Ross. After work, Destiny decides to go by Ari's house and apologize about what happened the night before. Instead, though, she finds herself being questioned about the events surrounding Ari's murder!<br /><br />Destiny can't believe that anyone would kill Ari, but considers the sad possibility of her own twin sister being the murderer. Her friend Ana-Li doesn't believe that Livvy is responsible, but Destiny doesn't know what to think of her sister anymore. Could she be the next victim? Two weeks go by without any more abnormalities, and Destiny gradually begins to have some sort of normal life once again. She meets Harrison, a college student and the new cook at the diner, and agrees to go to a friend's birthday party with him.<br /><br />While there, Destiny meets Harrison's friend Alby, and the reality shakes her once again that the presence of vampires is everywhere, and that the life she once knew will never return. A few days later, her twin sister has a nasty shock and thinks that Destiny is responsible. Livvy decides to plot her revenge against Destiny with Patrick, but doesn't realize that Destiny is fearful for her sister's life. Will Destiny save her sister in time, or will she become Livvy's next victim?<br /><br />I thought THE TASTE OF NIGHT was more suspenseful and intriguing than the first book. There were a few unexpected twists that kept you guessing right until the very end. I definitely recommend this book to fans of R.L. Stine and readers who like supernatural horror. It will be quite interesting to see what other events unfold in the town of Dark Springs as the series continues.<br /><br />  --- Reviewed by Sarah Sawtelle (SdarksideG@aol.com)	2004-09-17

Both the plot and the poetry were as good as Sonya Sones's previous book, STOP PRETENDING, and it was easy to forget the disappointment of the boring book in between, WHAT MY MOTHER DOESN'T KNOW. <br /> <br />The story starts on an airplane, as 15-year-old Ruby flies from the East Coast to Beverly Hills, California, to meet her father for the first time. Her mother has just died, and Ruby isn't too happy to be meeting a man who has acted in tons of movies yet hasn't found the time to even send her a birthday card. She decides to be as horrible to him as possible. <br /> <br />As is Sones's trademark, the story is told in verse, and poems focus on the trials and tribulations of being 15 and living with a man you've never met, the serious --- \\"and I didn't have Mom's hand to hold,/ my heart flung itself into my throat\\" and the not-so-serious --- \\"Oh./ My./ God.// I just got a ticket for crossing the street.\\" Unlike some poetry, it's extremely important to read the titles of each of these poems, as they usually serve as the poem's first line. <br /> <br />Ruby's father, Whip Logan, is a Tom Cruise-type character who lives next door to Cameron Diaz. She goes to school with the children of celebrities and swears that Brad Pitt was in line behind her at the store. However, Ruby is so sad and angry about having to leave her beloved Aunt Duffy, her best friend Lizzie, and her boyfriend Ray behind that she can't enjoy any of this. She's appalled by the classes her school offers --- \\"I just had to choose/ between signing up for// Dream Interpretation Through the Ages,/ Introduction to Transcendental Meditation,/ or The Films of Steven Spielberg\\" and the only fun she has is talking with her father's assistant, Max. <br /> <br />ONE OF THOSE HIDEOUS BOOKS WHERE THE MOTHER DIES is richly filled with great poetry, name-dropping, and e-mails to and from Ruby and her friends. As the year goes on, Ruby and her father learn tounderstand each other, with a few surprises along the way.

What began as a conscious decision to stop speaking has become a way of life: \\"She could bury the longing for her mother in this silence.... So many years had passed now and with every year she buried the longing deeper, the memory of her voice deeper into the good dirt of the silence.\\" Shuttled from foster home to children's home, unable to be reached by well-meaning social workers and priests, Jerry may finally have a chance for a real family with her great-great aunt Constanza, an accomplished baker in Albuquerque, New Mexico. <br /> <br />As Jerry comes to know Constanza and explore her adobe house, she begins to suspect that other secrets, other voices, are buried there. When she opens a trunk in the basement, she hears children's voices...and finds herself transported to fourteenth-century Spain, seeing the world through the eyes of Miriam, the daughter of a family of lace makers. As Jerry explores the trunk's secrets, she uncovers answers to many of her questions. Why does Aunt Constanza light candles on Friday evenings? Why does she throw a piece of dough in the fire before baking her delicious bread? Why do both Jerry and Constanza rub their heads when they are anxious? <br /> <br />Jerry discovers a historical root for almost all her questions, and also learns that she is not the first one in her family to bury her sorrows in silence. As she learns more about her family's rich and troubled heritage, she finds herself questioning everything: her traditions, her name, even her Catholic faith. She also finally, gradually, discovers her long-buried voice again. <br /> <br />With BLOOD SECRET, Kathryn Lasky has constructed a compelling story that stretches across centuries. Lasky successfully creates two convincing, evocative settings: the present-day Southwest and Inquisition-era Spain. As the narrative reaches back in time, the family relationships can be a little confusing, so the extensive family tree at the back of the book is extremely useful. Although the historical passages sometimes read like a history lesson, they are effectively integrated with the modern-day setting, and dedicated readers will probably appreciate this opportunity to learn more about a little-known, sometimes gruesome period in history. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl	2004-09-17

Pagan Kidrouk and his master, Lord Roland Roucy de Bram, are in Lord Roland's homeland seeking knights for a new Crusade to free the holiest of cities from the hands of the infidel. It is hard to know what Lord Roland's squire expected in his master's home in the south of France, but it certainly was not what they find when they arrive. <br /> <br />Lord Roland's father, brothers and their families and retainers live in such squalor and have such uncouth manners and ways that Pagan is appalled. How can his almost saintly master come from such a family? It is clearly a waste of time to think that this crowd of unbelieving savages will have any interest in freeing Jerusalem from the clutches of the infidel. Pagan is all for leaving as quickly as possible. He also begins to worry about the effect that Lord Roland's family is having on his master. They are like a disease, corrupting and evil, and Pagan wants to get his master away from their influence as soon as he can. Surely Roland cannot be continuing to hope to \\"civilize\\" his family and gain their support for his cause? <br /> <br />The situation then becomes very complicated when a local dispute breaks out between Lord Roland's father and the nearby abbey. People are killed and Lord Roland cannot bring himself to leave until he has done his best to find a resolution to the problem. However, the stubbornness of the Abbot and of Lord Roland's father is such that the dispute only escalates.  <br /> <br />Pagan is the most honest of narrators. His voice is funny and vibrant, and it gives us a vivid picture of his world, which is often dreadfully realistic. His first hunt leaves him sick at heart and in the stomach, and there is no doubt that the living conditions in Lord Roland's childhood home disgust the boy from Jerusalem. The people who live in that home don't impress him either. They are cruel, crude, often barbaric, and have very little respect for anyone outside their family circle. Pagan has such a wonderful sense of the ironic. He sees the things in life that make it pitiful on the one hand, and yet worth living on the other. He also sees the greatness in people, and his love for his master is complete. For Lord Roland, he will risk his life again and again and overcome his greatest fears. By the end of the book it is very hard not to feel great pride for this street boy from Palestine who has such a sharp tongue, quick wit, and big heart. <br /> <br />Catherine Jinks has once again given us a book that is difficult to put down, is often deeply disturbing, and leaves one wondering what Pagan and his master will do next. The savagery and often barbarity of the times can be difficult to read about, as well as the hypocrisy of the so-called men of God. There certainly are parallels with our own times, where men kill in the name of religion, failing to see that in so doing, they defile the very faith they profess to follow. Thought-provoking, even tear-jerking, this second book in the Pagan Chronicles series is highly recommended. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Marya Jansen-Gruber, editor of Through The Looking Glass Children's Book Review ([...]	2004-09-17

Hermia and her best friend, Helena, are totally into theater. Helena, blond and brainy, gets the star roles while curvy, bubbly Hermia is stuck with commandeering the spotlight or playing a tree. Both girls are smitten with guys. Hermia secretly pines for her friend Alex, while Helena is gaga over the new guy, Dmitri. Hermia has dated a lot while Helena is waiting for that special soulmate, and she believes fervently that Dmitri is The One. <br /> <br />The plot quickens when Dmitri tries out for \\"Romeo and Juliet.\\" Surely Helena will play Juliet, while Dmitri will be Romeo. Yet, Helena sometimes finds herself thinking about an ex-friend, Nick, who now hates her (or does he?). Helena would never even consider dating a popular football jock like Nick, even when her friends point out how nice and cute he is. <br /> <br />Hermia has problems of her own. Her drama teacher doesn't recognize that Hermia will someday be a famous actress, and should be treated accordingly. Her single-parent dad is way too controlling (one might consider the fact that her mother has left the family for another woman to be a big problem also, but the situation doesn't faze Hermia in the slightest). The drool-worthy Alex doesn't seem to consider her girlfriend material, but he does hatch a mysterious \\"secret plot\\" with Helena's help. And Helena becomes furious with her when Dmitri starts being a bit too attentive to Hermia. <br /> <br />Hermia and Helena each have a unique and distinct voice. Hermia's rapid-fire stand-up comic delivery contrasts nicely with Helena's languid romantic poet manner. Except for a few brief bits that I felt were redundant (notably, Helena's rather long-winded dramatic pining for Dmitri), the plot moves along rapidly and humorously, with lots of entertaining twists in the tale, making for an enjoyable light read. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon (terryms2001@yahoo.com)	2004-09-17

This is a lifestyle that he despises, possibly fears, and also one that he fled from when he was a boy. Though Pagan is often rude, disrespectful, impatient and irreverent, he is also loyal, and it is this loyalty that has made him decide to follow his master, Lord Roland, into a new life in the Abbey of St. Martin. After his experiences in a monastery school as a child, Pagan never dreamed that he would find himself pursuing the life of a monk, but he cannot bear to be separated from his distraught and emotionally lost master. <br /> <br />Thus it is that Pagan has to subject himself to blind obedience, rules that he thinks are ludicrous, and a life full of discomfort and unpleasantness. Needless to say, Pagan is not a good fit for the monastic life and it is a struggle for him to keep his temper, to stay out of trouble, and to try to adjust. Pagan does try his best, for Roland's sake, but all his efforts seem to be for naught when he starts looking into a little mystery that is floating about the Abbey. <br /> <br />Pagan discovers that beneath the veneer of respectability, piety and humility lies a complex tangle made up of lies, deceit and greed. Pagan may not be the most honest person in the world, but this kind of dirty hypocrisy upsets him enough that he will not stop seeking out the truth even when his very life is threatened. It would seem that someone very high up in the monastic hierarchy guides the conspiracy, and Pagan needs to be wary of what he says and does. <br /> <br />One cannot help but have a strong feeling of pity for Pagan. Here is a young man who could never be a monk, but for the love of a friend, he will put himself through a great ordeal --- accepting punishments, bullying, strenuous work, isolation and much more --- all for the sake of someone else. It is shocking to discover how difficult monastic life could be and how appalling the conditions often were. Certainly Pagan's experience puts a new light on the religious life in the times of the Crusades. <br /> <br />Entertaining, moving, skillfully researched, shocking at times, and very gripping, this third book in the Pagan Chronicles series is sure to delight readers who enjoy historical fiction. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Marya Jansen-Gruber, editor of Through The Looking Glass Children's Book Review ([...]	2004-09-17

What comes to mind? Do you picture a bearded old man, surrounded by sheep, cattle, horses, and dogs? Do you imagine the man floating in a sea of water, protected from the rains in the shelter of a wooden ark? <br /> <br />In her new book, IN THE SHADOW OF THE ARK, Flemish author Anne Provoost shatters the traditional image of Noah and his ark. Provoost provides a clever spin for the biblical tale by re-imagining this time-told story through the eyes of a young woman named Re Jana. <br /> <br />Powerfully written in beautiful prose, the story transforms readers into Re Jana's world. Re Jana and her family have lived on the waters of the marshes for years amongst skilled fishermen and shipbuilders. After a terrible accident that leaves her mother crippled, the family decides to travel to a city in the middle of the desert. They have heard rumors about a builder, named Noah, who is creating a massive ship. Re Jana's father, an expert boatmaker, seeks work from these desert peoples who are curiously constructing the huge boat. These people, however, are not like Re Jana and her family. Called \\"Rattika\\" they are wanderers and are accustomed to a life very different from the marsh people. <br /> <br />In an effort to find her place among these new people, Re Jana offers her skill to find \\"good water\\" for the Builder's family. Along with her water, Re Jana washes the Builder's sons with her sponges and oils. A relationship develops with Re Jana and the youngest son, Ham. Reality breaks the intensity of their love. Through Ham, Re Jana finds out the true purpose of the massive ark. The Builder's god has chosen the Builder and his family to collect all the animals on earth. A massive flood will wash away everything and everyone but the \\"chosen.\\" Another woman has been selected to be Ham's wife. The future for Re Jana and her family looks bleak. <br /> <br />Provoost does an amazing job transporting the reader into this apocalyptic biblical world. The strength of the character Re Jana is clear. She is a true heroine and we are rooting for her on every step of her challenging journey. Through the use of beautiful language and powerful emotions, Provoost creates a masterpiece. Along with the characters and their struggles, the reader is also confronted with the philosophical questions of the biblical tale. IN THE SHADOW OF THE ARK is an impressive novel that both teenagers and adults will enjoy. It also wouldn't be surprising if this book serves as the basis for a majestic Hollywood epic. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Kristi Olson (zooey24@yahoo.com)	2004-09-17

It centers on a girl named Chloe who meets this guy, Julian, at a college visit weekend in Connecticut. Chloe lives in Massachusetts and Julian lives in Florida, but that doesn't stop them from forming a close friendship over email. Chloe thinks she's falling in love, and Julian even sends her a dozen roses --- which wouldn't be so bad if they hadn't arrived as Chloe and her boyfriend Eli were having their pictures taken for their senior prom! <br /> <br />So everything in Chloe's life gets kind of crazy after that, between breaking up with Eli and fighting with her best friend, and heading off to summer arts camp. Chloe shares all of her problems with her older sister, the outrageous Genevieve. But Veev has a few problems she needs to share with Chloe as well. <br /> <br />Julian's life isn't exactly perfect, either. His mom and wanderlusting sister fight all the time, and now his sister is getting married to someone he doesn't even know. He's growing apart from his best friend and is tired of everyone telling him that he should date Nina, who has had a crush on him since forever. <br /> <br />This book is both heartwarming and heartbreaking, dealing honestly with the trials of the transition from high school to college and changes in families. Anyone who has had a relationship or family dilemma will identify with Ellen Wittlinger's personable characters and their difficulties. Not all love is perfect, and Chloe and her friends find that sometimes the best thing to do is to just let go. <br /> <br />ttyl, <br /> <br />CKW <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Carlie Webber	2004-09-10

No one else in her school understands this and tells her that she \\"is such a widow.\\" Nelia, his mother, is finding it hard to get out of bed.

The one chance for him, Kak decides, is to enlist in the Canadian Air Force. By doing so, he hopes to become a part of the Allied bombers during WWII. He dreams of showing off the honor of being a hero to his hometown of Kakabeka. Kak has one little secret, though --- he's only sixteen. <br /> <br />He is trained as a wireless operator and sent to a squadron in England. It is the spring of 1943 and the war is still going strong. When Kak arrives at an airfield in Yorkshire, his secret is immediately put to the test. His fellow hometown schoolmate, Donny Lee, is stationed at the airfield and is shocked to see Kak walk into the mess hall. Donny threatens to expose Kak's secret in order to save Kak's life, but relents when he sees how desperate his young friend is. <br /> <br />Kak meets his commanding officer, Uncle Joe, and is assigned to B for Buster. B for Buster is an old Halifax Mk 1 that has seen better in its day, but is considered reliable just the same. When his crew is taken to their assigned hut, they realize just what Buster has seen by the scarce number of occupied cots in the hut. The next day, they go on their first test flight in B for Buster, and Kak is chilled by the story of the Halifax's previous crew. <br /> <br />While they are gearing up for their first op, Lofty, the plane's pilot, goes on a \\"passenger trip\\" with another plane. The almost twenty-year-old is considered to be an adult by Kak and wants to be a bush pilot after the war. Buzz, the mid-upper gunner for Buster, is a former railway worker whose only goal in life, it seems, is to complete a crossword puzzle he cut out from a newspaper on his first day in England. Will, the navigator, would rather write poetry than study law, and Simon, the loud Australian, is the loudest gardener Kak has ever met. Ratty, the mysterious American, would like to see Berlin, and Pop, theflight engineer, just wants to make it home safely. <br /> <br />Time goes by and Donny Lee takes Kak for a ride out into the surrounding countryside. They take Donny's old black Morris automobile and Kak experiences just how crazy a ride it can be. But that's nothing compared to what it can be when a crew of seven ride in it, as Kak has witnessed before. The two schoolmates bond over stories of their hometown, and Donny tries once again to talk Kak into quitting the air force while he has the chance. Kak is excited about flying, though, and the ride that day seems to foreshadow the many dramatic changes that lie ahead. <br /> <br />Then the day finally comes, and B for Buster is called on for its first op. Kak is excited and feels as though it will be like a comic-book adventure where good beats evil. He is even a little too sure of himself, when he is given the task of watching over the homing pigeon that has been assigned to the op and is rude to the kind dismal pigeoneer named Dirty Bert. Kak is in for a reality check, however, when he experiences his first of many frightening flights and finds the outcast pigeoneer as one of the only friends who seems to understand him and his fears. <br /> <br />B FOR BUSTER is a dramatic adventure set during one of the greatest times in history. I recommend this book to anyone who has studied World War II and would like to read fiction set during that time period, as well as to those who enjoy reading dramatic novels. I thought it captured the importance of animals, specifically homing pigeons, and the various roles they take during wartime very well. Told through the eyes of a sixteen-year-old boy, B FOR BUSTER shows readers the excitement of being a hero and the grim realities they face. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Sarah Sawtelle (SdarksideG@aol.com)	2004-09-10

Since they lost their father, the Gold sisters --- May, Brooks and Palmer --- have not been the same. Before, they were typical teenagers who enjoyed carefree summer pranks. Now, their mother is not around as much; she has to work the night shift as a nurse to support the family, and the three sisters are left to fend for themselves. <br /> <br />THE KEY TO THE GOLDEN FIREBIRD tells the stories of three teenage sisters who are all very different, yet they're struggling with the same problem. May Gold, short for Mayzie, is the reliable sister --- she's smart, does well in school, works a part-time job to save money for college, and is expected to keep a watchful eye on her younger sister, Palmer. In a very un-Maylike turn of events, May fails her driver's exam. Pete Camp, the adorable dorky neighbor, volunteers to teach May to drive. During May's summer of driving lessons, she also encounters a bumpy ride of falling in love with someone she knew her whole life. <br /> <br />Brooks Gold is the oldest. As a testament to their father's addiction to baseball, Brooks is named after the famous baseball player Brooks Robinson. Brooks herself is a star softball player, but in the summer after her father's death, she finds herself hanging out with a new wild boyfriend, Dave, and his inner-circle of misfits. When Dave suggests that she quit the team, she comes to a realization. <br /> <br />Brooks thinks, \\"Her father had put a bat in her hand the minute she was strong enough to hold it up, and that was that. Afternoons and weekends were for playing. She didn't even know what people who didn't play sports did with their time. But she had to admit, she'd seen less and less of a point in playing in the last year.\\" Once off the team, Brooks has more time to drink excessively, come home way too late, and get into trouble. <br /> <br />Palmer Gold, the youngest, is also an amazing softball player. Even though she's only a freshman, she's a pitcher on the varsity softball team. Palmer lives in a world of her own, keeping her problems to herself. She doesn't tell anyone about the panic attacks that keep waking her up in the middle of the night. She also snoops around watching her sisters and rummaging through her mother's closet. During one of her investigations, she finds something she wasn't expecting that will be the key to helping her and her sisters feel better. <br /> <br />Maureen Johnson's first novel tells the touching tale of three sisters' journey as they find a way to make peace with their father's death. The Gold family deals with their grief the same way they treat their problems --- silently. As a result, each sister has an emotional explosion at the end of the book. While dealing with their emotions, they are also forced to realize the importance of each other as family.

He leaves 15-year-old Sebastian behind to care for the explorer's patient wife, Mattea. While Sebastian resents being left behind, he finds comfort in the letters he begins to receive from Sancio. The letters are filled with the long days of boredom and also some of the excitement as they embark into less explored areas. However, the letters stop abruptly and everyone is left to wonder what has happened. The only information they get comes through rumor and gossip as sailors come and go in the busy port. History sheds no light on this last voyage of John Cabot, but through the skillful storytelling skills of Henry Garfield, we catch a glimpse of what might have happened to this group of daring and brave explorers. <br /> <br />The letters to Sebastian from Sancio continue to be written but are not mailed, and it is this clever twist that allows readers to follow an intriguing path of the sailors' fates. Sancio, who is skilled in languages, writes to his brother that there is unrest among the men. This unrest possibly comes from two things: they feel that they have reached an Asian coastline, so it is time to return, and they are lonely for female company. \\"I think the sight of the native women has reminded some of the men of the loneliness of sea travel. There were two fights today.\\" Sancio continues to assure his brother that he feels his father has discovered an important land mass from England. <br /> <br />\\"When we return to England, Sebastian, we will bring with us the certainty that a great mass of land, reachable by ship from the shores of Europe, does indeed lie in the Western Ocean. It is Father's discovery, and he will become famous for it. I daresay the world as we know it will never be the same.\\" <br /> <br />The political maneuverings, the intrigues and deceptions are all captured in the rush of adventures that flow throughout this book. Henry Garfield presents a realistic picture of the possible horrors and heartbreaks that might have been experienced by Cabot's crew. Clipper ship tales are quite popular these days, and this exciting story of John Cabot's last voyage is sure to be enjoyed for its insights and wonderful historical pictures. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Sally M.

This appears to be the main subject of her letter to a businessman named Mr. Teeter. But LETTING GO OF BOBBY JAMES isn't just a simple commentary on what the best recipe for coleslaw is or the fine convenience of food markets. It's the story of how a young woman's determination to make a better life for herself unwittingly changes the lives of those around her. <br /> <br />Jody is only sixteen when she marries a young man named Bobby James. They met at a school dance, and it seemed to be love at first sight. They are now on vacation in Florida and Jody doesn't think life can get any better than this. But Jody's perspective on life changes drastically when Bobby slaps her and she hides in the gas station restroom. It is at this point that Jody decides to create a new future for herself --- without her husband. <br /> <br />After taking a bus to Jackson Beach and spending the night in a parked car, Jody begins searching for a job. She is hired as a dishwasher at Thelma's Open 24-Hour Cafe and Grill and becomes friends with a waitress named Marilyn. The only thing left for Jody to do is to find somewhere to sleep. She decides that the best place is the local cineplex. The next day she goes to a thrift shop to buy some work supplies and witnesses the plight of a weary cashier, who seems to be in a worse situation than Jody. <br /> <br />Jody later finds out just how bad the situation is. The girl is named Effaline; she is pregnant, living in a shabby apartment complex, and is currently unemployed. The two teens quickly become friends and Jody returns to the cineplex for the night. She writes a letter to her mother in the ladies' restroom and then goes to sleep in the theater. When she wakes up, she meets a sweeper named Dooley who is worried about losing his job, but wants to be Jody's friend nonetheless. <br/> <br />Jody slowly starts to form a new life and future for herself. At the same time, though, she's trying to deal with the unfortunate fact that the relationship with her family will never be the same again. She meets a few more interesting people and realizes how unique her life is becoming, especially when disaster strikes and Effaline, Dooley and Jody are faced with one of the greatest tests of all --- a test that, in the end, shows just how Jody found herself \\"full of steam.\\" <br /> <br />LETTING GO OF BOBBY JAMES is a very good book that stresses the importance of each person's life, no matter how simple it may be. The story is poignant and funny, in terms of the relationships between Jody and her friends and co-workers. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading realistic fiction or has delved into Valerie Hobbs's work before. Just like Jody's coleslaw, you'll find yourself wanting more after the first taste. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Sarah Sawtelle (SdarksideG@aol.com)	2004-09-07

She has \\"type A blood, a type A personality, and . . . an A-cup bra.\\" Mara is on the fast track to success: she's duking it out for valedictorian, she's been accepted early decision by Yale, and she's already taking college courses. Mara's much older sister Aimee has always been a screw-up, traveling around the world in search of the next big thing. Mara is desperate not to disappoint her mom and dad the way Aimee did --- she has to succeed because she is her parents' \\"Only Hope.\\" <br /> <br />Secretly, though, Mara is vulnerable: her college courses have left her without many high school friends, and she's still reeling from a painful breakup with equally high-achieving Travis. She hides her insecurities by trying to control absolutely everything, from her schedule to her emotions to her diet. She confesses that she has become a vegan not only because she is \\"grossed out by animal byproducts\\" but because veganism is \\"all-consumingly obsessive. . . . It can be a pain, but it helps keep my mind off things.\\" <br /> <br />That's why, when Aimee's troublemaking daughter (and Mara's niece), sixteen-year-old V, comes to live with Mara's family while Aimee chases her surfer boyfriend to Costa Rica, Mara is furious. V has always had the ability to see through Mara's veneer and to call attention to Mara's fears and anxieties. When V moves in on Mara's ex, Mara vows never to be friends with this \\"class-ditching, chair-in-the-principal's-office-warming deadbeat.\\" <br /> <br />V's tough-talking, no-nonsense attitude does rub off on Mara, though, as she begins to question why she has made the choices she has. When she starts to have feelings for James, her boss at the coffee shop, her life gets even more confused. If James, who has never been to college but owns a successful small business, can be one of the smartest (not to mention the cutest) people she has ever met, does Mara need to redefine the meaning of success? <br /> <br />Like Carolyn Mackler's earlier novels, VEGAN VIRGIN VALENTINE has a winning combination of a likeable main character, zingy narration, and some truly funny one-liners. Readers who find themselves identifying with misunderstood V may be somewhat frustrated by the novel's primary focus on Mara's development. This intriguing character screams to be the star of her own novel, and readers will likely find themselves wishing for a sequel. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl	2004-09-07

Hindrances block true love's way: Her previous crush is chasing her, she can't quite TALK to Josh, he keeps referring to another girl, and he tries to hook her up with his loser cousin.

As she struggles with the basics of romance, her best friend Rebecca (recently named one of CHIC magazine's New York \\"IT\\" Girls) smoothly hooks up with a gorgeous older man ... wouldn't you just know it? <br /> <br />Jan's hardships don't end with the Josh conundrum. Her parents are irritating, her butt is enormous, and college application deadlines are zooming up.

Should I mention how Jan, acting out with Josh a scene from Romeo and Juliet in English class, opens her mouth, puckers her lips, and waits for a real kiss (Romeo doesn't kiss her)? Or should it be her struggle to find the perfect outfit to baby-sit Josh's sibling? \\"With only forty-nine hours to put together an outfit that said both 'I am a responsible baby-sitter who will not abandon your child to pursue pleasures of the flesh' and 'I am a sexual dynamo,' I headed upstairs to evaluate my options.\\" Or maybe I should go with Jan's description of her hair: exactly like the Great Pyramid at Giza.

Each poem is a glimpse into the private world of one of twenty different characters, all attending the same high school. While each person may be separated in school by the usual social boundaries, they privately share many of the same desires, fears and longings. <br /> <br />The poems range from the humorous, \\"My girlfriend is in love with Holden Caulfield\\" or the darkly hilarious, \\"Suburban myths,\\" to more serious subjects such as \\"The Patron Saint of Stoners,\\" about an honor society student buying marijuana for her terminally ill mother. One of the book's highlights is a poem called \\"Gospel,\\" about what happens when Gail, a deeply Christian choir singer, shares her music with Anton, the school's resident outcast. <br /> <br />As one gets further into the book, the interconnectedness between the poems and the characters becomes apparent. The book begins and ends with poems about the same relationship, from two different points of view. While many of the characters feel isolated and alone, they are in fact part of a vibrant, interrelated community. <br /> <br />David Levithan is also the author of BOY MEETS BOY, set in a comparably tolerant community. Like THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY, it focuses on the similarities between characters instead of their differences. Both books treat sex preference as a normal expression rather than as a problem or source of trauma. This approach is a relatively new development in young adult literature; Levithan's books are a marvelous example of how homosexual themes are being integrated into mainstream young adult literature. <br /> <br />THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY contains many possibilities: in the events occurring to the characters in the book, in the lives of its readers, and in its promise for the future of YA literature. The use of free verse to convey plot, character and meaning is a brilliant and intuitive choice. The poems read like they are written by young adults, and Levithan clearly delineates characters using different styles and tones. While there are a number of novels in free verse written for younger readers, THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY may be the first in this form intended for young adults. This book is likely to be the source of inspiration for many budding poets. <br /> <br />THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY is about love, identity and our interconnectedness as humans. Each poem is about discovering oneself through love, and speaks to the idea that as long as our hearts are open, we are never truly alone. As Levithan writes in the title poem, \\"As hard as it is for us to see sometimes, we all exist/ within the realm of possibility. Most of the limits/ are of our own world's devising. And yet,/ every day we each do so many things that were once impossible to us.\\" <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Sarah A. Wood	2004-09-07

Then Ray threatens a staff member, and he too is \\"permanently excluded.\\" The only happiness the boys have is listening to music and spending time at the local music shop. The store is run by an older Jamaican, who they affectionately call \\"Marga Man.\\" <br /> <br />Once the boys are no longer in school, they get into even more trouble on the streets. The reality of their situation hits hard when they are thrown in jail for fighting in a public park, which only angers their parents further. When the school board contacts their families, it seems as if there is only one solution. The boys have been invited to join an alternative education program targeted towards what interests them most: music. All of their studies will be focused on music and the music industry. As part of this experience, they are to work in an actual recording studio. Although some of their parents are hesitant at first, the boys give it a shot. <br /> <br />With Marga Man as their manager, the boys create a rap group called the Positive Negatives. They are swept up into the music industry and become superstars practically overnight. They record an album, perform on television, and are selling out live concerts. At this point, the plot seems to go off track, like a train running out of control. In the first part of the book, the reader is drawn in slowly by the characters of Ray, Tyrone and Prem. As the music takes over their lives, the plot speeds up on overdrive, and the subtleties of each teen are lost. <br /> <br />And then, in an odd and almost confusing twist of events, the issue of gang warfare comes into the story. The Positive Negatives are first being harassed and then attacked by unknown gang members. Now, they struggle to deal with both their fame and the world of the cruel streets. <br /> <br />Author Benjamin Zephaniah is a poet and performing artist in England. His poetry is displayed in the rap lyrics that are scattered throughout this work.

The rules keep Alison in a brittle existence that is shattered by further traumatic events involving her friends. Alison learns that the pain of emotions rather than the numb existence she was striving for is actually better, as it helps her heal. <br /> <br />Catherine Clark's previous novels were popular for their realistic characters and humorous situations, similar in style to Joan Bauer's books. Her female characters pursued their own interests and dreams in addition to dating and friends. THE ALISON RULES deviates from her usual style and themes. <br /> <br />Alison herself is the narrator and keeps her mother's death a secret from readers until late in the book. We later understand that she was not ready to deal with her mother's death, let alone talk about it. But it would have made her a more sympathetic character if she had let us in on what exactly her problem was from the first few pages. It is not until we know what is going on that her rules begin to make sense. For example, she will not use her locker, we understand later, because she was standing by it when she was paged to the principal's office and learned of her mother's death. <br /> <br />Laurie, Alison's best friend, does her best to support her. Their friendship is a strength of this book...until they fall out over liking the same boy. This storyline is disappointing to find here, but Clark has the friendship come first with the girls (even though they have a hurtful argument about it) rather than the boy, in a refreshing twist. <br /> <br />A sudden surprise tragedy near the end of the book will cause readers to bring out the Kleenex.

Katy wants to get out, get away from the poverty, the death, and the hunger. She wants to follow her dreams. But she doesn't want to leave her family. <br /> <br />Then her younger brother Nate is offered a job working in the mines. Her parents think it is wonderful that he will be able to help put more food on the table. But Katy can't stand it: Now, when the alarm rings, she fears for two lives. And even though the family has more food, Nate is often too tired to hold up his fork. <br /> <br />Then Katy learns that her distant, worn-down mother is pregnant --- again. And Katy is being pressured to either drop out of school to work or marry Kenny Randall, the son of the owner of the mine. No one cares that she truly loves Michael Stoner, and that one day, he'll also be working in the dangerous mines. There seems to be no escape for her.  <br /> <br />Just when things are at their very worst, Katy is offered hope. Now, she must decide if leaving the mines is worth leaving her family and her love. Quickly.   <br /> <br />The Foreword to this novel says that the author herself grew up in a mining town and that many of her family members worked in mines. Perhaps that is why this novel is so rich with historical details: the mother sweeping the house of the coal dust that inevitably gathers each day; children sharing beds and clothes and dirty bath water; and the constant worry of where the next meal will come from. These details really added to the story, and you can't help but feel Katy's plight. <br /> <br />However, and perhaps because the author hassuch firsthand experience, I found the novel too, too depressing. There was little hope to be found in any corner, and that made reading difficult and not always enjoyable. And while it may be realistic that Katy's mom turned cold from her bitter life, I had a hard time feeling sympathy for her. In a book of such intensity, the reader needs some sort of happiness now and then; but Katy's story just got worse and worse --- and even in the end, things seemed uncertain.  <br /> <br />If you are looking for a good book on mining towns, you might also try A LETTER TO MRS. ROOSEVELT by C. Coco de Young. While DIAMOND IN THE DUST is historically accurate, it's hard to feel too much for the characters. It's almost as though you're too scared to get attached because of what might happen.

In 1961 he moves with him family to the American military base in Meuse, France, near the site of a famous and bloody World War I battle. He soon meets &quot;Cannonball&quot; Wall, who explains the social structure among the young people at the base. There are two categories --- aces and deuces. The aces are the cool guys; the deuces are to be avoided at all costs. <br />  <br /> O. B., of course, longs to be an ace, but soon develops a friendship with a French boy named Claude. &quot;Claude the Clod,&quot; as he is called by the base aces, lacks athletic ability, dresses in French styles that the Americans consider weird and tells corny jokes. But he is also kind to O. B., especially after O. B. fails to make the base's baseball team. Claude teaches the new arrival much about France --- and friendship. <br />  <br /> O. B. is a very honest narrator, sharing his feelings of disappointment, confusion, loneliness, fright, and happiness with the reader. It is easy to sympathize with him as he tries to fit in at the base, so far away from his old home in the United States. By the novel's end, O. B. and the reader seem almost as close as O. B. and his friends in France. <br />  <br /> Much of the book is built around baseball --- a game that O. B. desperately wants to be good at so that he can make the team. Donahue takes his narrator from the depths of disappointment at an embarrassing tryout to the height of victory later in the book. Along the way, baseball practice provides a fine scene for O. B. and his father, a man with lots of responsibility who also always finds a way to spend important time with his wife and son. Donahue does a fine job writing about adult characters like O. B.'s father and Claude's grandfather as well as about the young people. <br />  <br /> The threat of war provides much of the book's late tension, but Donahuenever loses track of his primary story --- the development of lasting friendships.

When you look at all the possibilities, maybe you want to back off of that first impression, dig into the facts around the whole situation before making a hasty, and possibly fatal, decision. That's just where Anne Murphy, a beautiful, young Philadelphia lawyer, finds herself. <br />  <br /> The day before the nation's birthday celebration, Anne pulls off a gutsy coup in the courtroom, winning a motion in a highly unconventional way. Heady with victory, she looks around for someone with whom to share her triumph, but since she doesn't have any friends, no one comes to mind. So, despite her aversion to exercise, she forces herself to work out at the gym on her way home. There, she befriends Willa Hansen, a petsitter, and arranges for Willa to take care of Mel, her personable cat, over the Fourth of July weekend. Fortunately, for Anne, she finds an apartment at the shore at the last minute. Now she can escape the bedlam of patriotism on Independence Day in the City of Brotherly Love, and get some work done preparing for the big trial on Tuesday. She spends the evening enduring holiday traffic, arriving late at her quiet retreat. <br />  <br /> On her early morning jog the next day, Anne glimpses the horrifying words at the newsstand, &quot;Lawyer Found Murdered.&quot; As she reads the subheading, she discovers, to her total bewilderment, that she is the victim. It slowly dawns on her that Willa must have died in her place, and her suspicion is that Kevin, a deranged stalker from her past, must have gotten out of prison early. <br />  <br /> Anne realizes early on that she will need help. She turns to three members of the all-women law firm where she works. The rest of the holiday weekend is filled with the capers of these four gorgeous lawyers chasing clues around Philly in a red Mustang convertible. Bennie Rosato, the firm's owner, becomes the voice of reason among her young associates. Curbing their sometimes harebrained schemes, however, proves too much even for her. With Anne falling in love with opposing counsel on her largest case, Bennie has her hands full keeping everyone focused on what's important. <br />  <br /> The final plan, however, is Anne's alone. While it works fairly well, all does not go exactly as hoped. Then comes the surprise. <br />  <br /> Ms. Scottoline's fans, especially those who have awaited the return of Bennie Rosato & Associates, will find this an easy summer read. <br />  <br /> The bottom line is that COURTING TROUBLE, unlikely plot or not, is loads of fun, lots of good girl talk, with a sexy car and a great wrap-up. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Kate Ayers <br />	2004-07-29

Through four teens, Eve Eliot shows real teens the trials and tribulations of these diseases. <br />  <br /> First there's Samantha who starves herself to be in control. Her boyfriend Brian has dumped her, and according to her, it was because she was too fat. She vacuums her room up to five times daily, getting rid of the piles of dust that accumulate between cleanings. Is there anything wrong with this? Apparently Samantha doesn't yet realize there is. <br />  <br /> Next comes Hannah. The death of her mother causes her to turn to bingeing and purging, which she knows is wrong, but she can't help herself. Often confused about friendships, Hannah decides that it is time to make a change in her life and chooses to &quot;come out of the closet.&quot; She now feels even more alone in her plight, alienated from family and friends, and must deal with her teenage troubles alone. How will she fare in the vicious teenage world? <br />  <br /> Then there's Jessica. She lives for fashion, always paying attention to the latest styles. She is a normal teen --- except for her starvation problem. Diet Coke and coffee are all she allows herself. She doesn't attend English class after a while, because it's on the second floor, and she isn't strong enough to walk up the stairs. One of Jessica's biggest fears is becoming overweight, like her best friend Phoebe, even as she finds comfort in her friend's obesity. <br />  <br /> Phoebe finds comfort in food. She promises herself to diet, but it never happens. She often sneaks down to the kitchen to &quot;have a little snack,&quot; but that turns into a three course meal. Her father repeatedly tells her to lose weight, but her fight against food is never ending. <br />  <br /> These four teens are engaged in a constant struggle against the one thing that every human needs to live --- food. Will they win or lose? INSATIABLE exposes the dangers involved with eating disorders. Within the stories, Eliot adds important facts that teens need to know about anorexia and bulimia, making the novel both informative and interesting. Pick up this novel to learn more about the world of eating disorders, and how four teenagers fared with their own personal battles.  <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Lisa Marx  <br />  <br />	2004-07-29

In the &quot;old&quot; days, people in the United States actually spent part of their leisure time &quot;spinning yarns,&quot; telling stories true and exaggerated or fake and farfetched. It is hard to imagine, in this day of the computer, people passing anything down to each other without putting it on a hard drive first. However, in Sharyn McCrumb's wonderfully intricate THE SONGCATCHER, a young woman searches out her family legacy in a song that has been passed through the generations, which tells her more about where she came from than any legal document ever could. This is a yarn if there ever was one. <br />  <br /> Lark McCourry is a contemporary girl with one foot firmly in the past. As a folksinger, she finds all music fascinating, but the song passed throughout her family ties is special. Brought to existence by one Malcolm McQuarry, an ancestor who moved to the States from Scotland in 1759, it was learned aboard an English ship and traveled with Malcolm all his life, from Morristown, New Jersey to Western North Carolina. The song gained new strength and purpose as the McCourry family suffered through the American Revolution, the Civil War, and the other great upheavals that shaped a nation...and a family history as well. Lark must turn to Nora Bonesteel, a friend of her father's, for information --- Nora has the ability to talk to both the dead and the living, and Lark needs to explore both realms in order to discover the real meaning of the song. <br />  <br /> McCrumb is a writer compelled by an inner truth to look at life from all sides. Her characters are deep and enriched with truly human attributes (Lark's father will start to feel like a member of the family halfway into the story), and the whole thing reads like her own family history. You get the sense that the author has been here before, in this territory, living among these people, listening, watching. I felt like some secret had been spilled bravely by her, a tale of a family that had been rightly protected until her eager writer-self convinced them to let her tell their adventures to everyone. THE SONGCATCHER has that spectral quality. <br />  <br /> THE SONGCATCHER is a wonderful book (and, by the way, was recently made into a wonderful film by Maggie Greenlaw and is available on video). Once you get the story of this song inside your own head, you will hear its music in your heart as well. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Jana Siciliano <br />	2004-07-29

Before long, this preacher and false prophet has the proper, God-fearing ladies of Corvallis throwing off their corsets, letting down their hair, burning their worldly possessions, and signing over their assets. Eva Mae, her mother, and her sister Maud are just a few of Creffield's ardent followers, and for a time, his revival meetings are even held in the Hurt home, much to the chagrin of their skeptical father. Not so easily charmed by his good looks and charisma, both Hurt and his fellow menfolk are understandably put off by Creffield's particular brand of religious fanaticism. They've lost wives, daughters, girlfriends, and mothers to his way-out ideas. But when it seems things couldn't get any worse, the men discover that Creffield has been intimate with nearly everyone of his followers on the flimsy excuse that he was trying to find the \\"second mother.\\" What ensues is a strange string of events in which many of the once-rational women are declared insane, institutionalized, and cured, only to fall once again under Creffield's seductive spell. Murder and suicide finally bring the cult down, Creffield and all.  <br /> <br />Based on actual events, BRIDES OF EDEN is truth imagined. Crew, author of CHILDREN OF THE RIVER, indulged a lifelong fascination in bringing the events surrounding cult-leader Joshua Creffield and his followers to life. From 1903 to 1906, Creffield and his women were the talk of Corvallis, Oregon. Crew, a Corvallis native, grew up seeped in lore about the preacher and his women and was hooked. Through extensive research conducted in the annals of Corvallis history (newspaper articles, historical records, and such), Crew was able to convincingly recreate this engaging, albeit strange, story.  <br /> <br /> <br />--- Reviewed by Tammy L.

But none has ever said it with quite the passion and resonance of J. R. R. Tolkien in his groundbreaking opus, THE LORD OF THE RINGS. This lengthy sequel to THE HOBBIT, mistakenly considered a trilogy due to its being published in three parts (&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; and &quot;The Return of the King&quot;), has maintained its reputation as the benchmark achievement of &quot;sword-and-sorcery&quot; literature for 47 years.<br /><br /> In the exquisitely detailed story of Middle-Earth's great war and the quest to destroy the One Ring, a token imbued with evil power, stands a fable for the ages echoing with the message that the future is ours to choose even in the face of inevitable change. This epic stands as such a singular achievement due in part to its broadly identifiable heroes, vivid realization of Middle-Earth and its history, and the epic scope of the story in which everyone is willing to risk themselves for the good of the world.<br /><br /> The story picks up some 60 years after THE HOBBIT, enjoying the same conspiratorial tone of narration as that of its predecessor. In the Shire, home of the diminutive, man-like race called Hobbits, we meet young Frodo, new owner of the Ring of Invisibility. The comforts of his rustic homeland become all the more dear to Frodo when he learns that his ring is the One Ring of Power, possessed of endless evil from its maker, the evil Sauron. Informed that Sauron is searching for the Ring --- the only thing standing between him and world domination --- and that the Ring will ultimately corrupt any one who owns it, Frodo undertakes a mission to travel across Middle-Earth to destroy the Ring in Sauron's own stronghold. Accompanied by three Hobbit friends --- Sam, Merry, and Pippin --- Gandalf the Wizard, and four others appointed as representatives of the free races of Middle-Earth, Frodo ventures beyond the world that he knows into the wild of the larger world and places fraught with peril. Each of the so-called &quot;Nine Walkers&quot; has a critical role to play in the course of events, both in the destruction of the Ring and in the coordination of the war against Sauron's forces.<br /><br /> Frodo himself is very much the Everyman with whom readers will identify so well. In his fear, indecision, and courage, the little hobbit represents anyone who reaches a point in life when they have to make irrevocable choices without certainty of the results. Faced with the choice to do nothing and risk harm to everyone he knows or to venture into the unknown alone, against his greatest fear, Frodo chooses --- time and again --- to do the right thing. &quot;I feel that as long as the Shire lies behind, safe and comfortable, I shall find wandering more bearable...&quot; Accompanying Frodo to the bitter end is his gardener, Sam Gamgee, a character possessed of an astounding level of loyalty to his employer. In Sam Gamgee, Tolkien crafted the true friend who stays with us through thick and thin and who would give us the shirt off his back without being asked. Sam remains overtly overprotective of Frodo from beginning to end, refusing to be left behind even for his own good and even forgoing food and water for Frodo's benefit. The choices that Sam is forced to make provide some of the book's most heartbreaking moments. The other hobbits, Merry and Pippin, display a range of irksome silliness and denial until pressed to hard choices, and both prove themselves worthy players on the stage of world affairs.<br /><br /> Through the character of Strider (Aragorn), a seasoned warrior wise beyond belief, Tolkien is able to interweave elements of mystery, bittersweet romance, unrequited love, predestination, and ultimate sacrifice. While every character is willing to expend themselves in the efforts tostop Sauron, Strider is the first after Gandalf to join the quest with a full understanding of the consequences of failure (&quot;...if by life or death I can save you, I will&quot;). The introduction of Strider also introduces us to the diversity of Middle-Earth through the many names by which the various races (Elves, Dwarves, nations of Men, Orcs) call him. Throughout most of the novel languages are interchanged, giving people, objects, and places a variety of names. In this way THE LORD OF THE RINGS realizes the gravity of the situation, that a vast group of divided nations are putting aside their differences to face a common enemy who threatens the entire world. This idea is also affirmed in the unconventional friendship that develops between Gimli the Dwarf and Legolas the Elf, whose races have a history of enmity dating back centuries.<br /><br /> Tolkien worked on this novel over the course of 13 years, a fact that becomes clear in the narrative tone that moves from conspiratorial to grimly melodramatic as the story moves towards its climax and the heroes' respective situations become dire (&quot;So they were come to the bitter end&quot;). The extent to which the author labored over this work is also apparent in the complete realizations he painted of each character and each race. The inherent qualities of the various species are thoroughly described in terms of the physical, spiritual, aesthetic, lingual, and intellectual. The speech and actions of each reinforces the images of &quot;stupid Hobbits,&quot; &quot;foul Orcs,&quot; &quot;fair Elves,&quot; and &quot;hardy Dwarves.&quot;<br /><br /> A lot of attention is also paid to the terrain of Middle-Earth as the travelers move from the lush, green comfort of the Shire to rough mountain passes and wastelands created by industrial processes. Whether the characters experience comfort or suffering in the wilderness, the reader feels the situation fully. The greatest evidence of Tolkien's extensive mythology-building is the 103 pages of appendices to which the text frequently refers. It is hard to say whether readers should refer to these whenever prompted or simply read the book straight through and then read the appendices.

Note: I will not let the fact that she is a highly successful novelist and I am just a shlumpy old loser affect my review in the least. <br />  <br /> In SHATTERED MIRROR, Atwater-Rhodes does Buffy one better. The protagonist of the story is Sarah Tigress Vida, is a vampire hunter AND a witch. Double occult whammy! Her whole family are vampire hunters --- have been forever. Sarah is a totally hard-core, tough girl. A loner, she prefers the company of the night stars to actual humans. Sarah is proud to be a Vida witch and loves all the honor that name conveys. She would never consort with the enemy...or would she? <br />  <br /> Trouble starts brewing when Sarah meets two charming vampires posing as high school students. Christopher is a &quot;harmless&quot; vampire, living off animal blood or willing human donors. He is artistic, kind and, of course, really cute and Sarah reluctantly begins to find herself crushing on him bad. Christopher returns the feelings by writing her love poetry and giving her sketches he has made.  <br />  <br /> As we all know, love can be quite confusing. Sarah is thrown completely off, not just by her raging hormones, but also by the fact that the boy she cares for should, technically, be on her &quot;Dead&quot; list. Sarah finds herself questioning her entire life and all the traditions of her family. She can't get her mind around hunting vampires anymore, as her family has sworn to do. Can a vampire hunter and her undead prey learn to love each other? <br />  <br /> SHATTERED MIRROR takes a crazy twist just as readers will be hoping for Sarah and Christopher to get together. Turns out Christopher is actually Kristopher, twin brother of one of the most hated and hunted vampires of history, Nikolas. The fiend Nikolas is famous for carving his name into his victims and Sarah wants to be the Vida to take Nikolas down. Will her new feelings for Christopher cause her to change her mind? And will they lead her to a dangerous decision, a decision that would tarnish her family's reputation --- and cost Sarah her mortal soul? <br />  <br /> All these questions and more will be answered, promise. Fans of Atwater Rhodes will be pleased to see the return of characters like Caryn Smoke. Fans and non-fans alike will be totally engrossed in this story about the battle between love, evil and tradition.

Award-winning author Karen Hesse's latest book covers a surprising series of events. It takes place in 1924, in Vermont, as the Ku Klux Klan begins to move into a quiet town. You didn't know that the Klan was active in the North? Me neither. History books make it sound like a strictly southern force --- but as the real events on which Hesse based this book prove that it's just not so. <br /> <br />At first, the book looks as though it may be a play: each character is seen with their picture attached. But, in fact, the novel is written in verse. One 12-year-old character, Leanora Sutter, is the only black girl in the small town. She befriends an odd Jewish girl named Esther, even though Esther is half her age. Together they face the stream of prejudice spewed forth by the Klan.  <br /> <br />Their small town is not used to the ways of the Klan. Many are drawn into it because of the friendship its members share; others honestly believe, for a short time, that the Klan is looking out for the best interests of the town. By the time people realize what it is really about, hateful, violent acts begin happening late at night. Those who have joined are frightened. Those who opposed the Klan to begin with are terrified. Esther's father is shot at, and Mr. Sutter's friend is threatened repeatedly.   <br /> <br />Hesse creates wonderful characters --- the creepy Reverend Reeves, sassy Iris Weaver, and most of all, Leanora and Esther. In WITNESS we see that even in the smallest town, people run the gamut of personalities: from almost evil to amazingly brave and good. The action and suspense kept me turning the pages. <br /> <br />As a big fan of Karen Hesse, I couldn't help but be troubled by one factor in this novel --- the voice of Esther. It seems too obviously to be based on the wonderful and little-known writings of Opal Whiteley. For someone who is normally as historically accurate as Karen Hesse, I was disappointed that she didn't take this opportunity to let readers know about Opal.  <br /> <br />Still, WITNESS is a great read about a fascinating topic. If you want historical fiction about the Ku Klux Klan, read this. Karen Hesse doesn't cut corners on gritty and frightening details. But, if you want an amazing and poetic read where you feel like you're in a whole other world, pick up Opal Whiteley, and spread the word: she's so cool, she might have been the world's first peace-loving hippie.  <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Kate Torpie <br />	2004-07-29

But with books like Sarah Dessen's DREAMLAND, Louisa Luna's BRAVE NEW GIRL and first time novelist Alex Flinn's BREATHING UNDERWATER, YA authors and publishers clearly deserve most of the credit for striking a blow against the don't-ask-don't-tell status quo and giving this overlooked epidemic some much needed attention. <br />  <br /> Of course, the problem for teen authors has now become: Amid the flurry of second-rate trauma/drama stories that have descended on teen audiences like a flock of Oprahs (the aforementioned BNG and DRMLND notwithstanding), how do I write a book about an abusive teen relationship and still maintain a fresh perspective? Flinn's approach is both a unique and effective one --- BREATHING UNDERWATER explores the abusive relationship between two highschoolers from the abuser's perspective.  <br />  <br /> Nick is a smart, rich, popular, good-looking 16-year-old guy. From his backstory --- his father is both physically and mentally abusive --- Psych 101 tells us that he, too, will be an abuser. And, in fact, he is. When we first meet Nick, the consequences of his furious blows against his girlfriend have left him slapped with a restraining order, ostracized by his peers and forced to undergo rehabilitation in the form group therapy sessions with other abusers (though Nick seems them as abunch of psychos). He is also instructed to keep a journal chronicling his relationship with his girlfriend from the first moment they met. It is through this stylistic device --- interweaving the retrospective journal entries throughout the present day action of the story --- that the reader best witnesses Nick's decent from an all American boy with a dark and troubled past to a convicted felon estranged from the woman he loves. <br />  <br /> The victim of Nick's fists of fury is Caitlin. Once fat, now beautiful, Caitlin has the sort of &quot;issues&quot; that make her a prime target for abuse. We are left to suppose that her fatness was either the cause or a consequence of her low self-esteem. In either case, her current view of herself is considerably less positive than the way others see her. To the outside world she could have any boy she chooses, but in her own mind, she's lucky to have a cad like Nick. This core belief binds her to Nick even as he calls her fat and stupid and, eventually, beats her to a pulp. Is Caitlin simply too terrified to talk about the abuse? Or, on some level, does she feel she deserves it? Most likely, it is a combination of the two. But either way, Nick and Caitlin's sick theater of pain and degradation continues unchecked until the authorities finally step in. <br />  <br /> BREATHING UNDERWATER walks a thin line between letting us understand Nick and excusing his actions. For the most part, the author chooses to ignore that line. Her solution is to report the truth of the world as she sees it and let the reader assign blame. But if shame is the product of being wrong, then Nick was wrong indeed. His shame and the depth of his sorriness are spelled out in heart stroking details. By the end of the story his rehabilitation is complete: Nick finally realizes that what he did to Caitlin was inhumane and cruel and starts to make strides towards &quot;unteaching&quot; himself all that he's learned from his father's example. Readers may question the veracity of this quick change, but Flinn's prose is generally deft enough to support it. A happy ending for Caitlin is less clear. Has she acquired the tools to avoid being a victim again or will she fall prey to the next unreconstructed Nick clone that rolls across her path? BREATHING UNDERWATER seems hopeful, but as real life has proven, we can't be absolutely sure.  <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Jamal Matthews <br />  <br />	2004-07-29

In normal literature, such a moment might be devoted to doomed romance or drug addiction. There's something wonderfully nerdy about the fact that in WORD FREAK it involves a board game.  <br />  <br /> Fatsis originally planned to write WORD FREAK as a journalistic account of an odd but harmless subculture. Scrabble was then just another board game in his living room; if writing the book would make him a better player, it was a byproduct hardly worth mentioning. But as Fatsis' interest in Scrabble expanded, he found himself spending more and more time playing, entering more tournaments, practicing more, and making more friends than was strictly necessary to write a book. A year into the project, he took a leave of absence from his job as a sports reporter for the Wall Street Journal and joined the Scrabble tour full-time. <br />  <br /> In retrospect, Fatsis' decision was not only incredible, but also inevitable. There are few financial or social rewards for Scrabble expertise --- in fact, there are large disincentives on both fronts --- but like all of his Scrabble friends, Fatsis was drawn to the game for reasons he didn't fully understand. It's a contention of WORD FREAK that players tend to find their proper place, and Fatsis was no exception --- as the book progresses, he becomes an expert player. His only explanation for this strange turn of events is that, at a fundamental level, he always was one. Even when he was playing old ladies in the beginner rounds, he had the need to succeed at Scrabble. <br />  <br /> If this sounds like a typical underdog story, it shouldn't. Unlike many books about sports, WORD FREAK isn't a series of big defeats followed by larger triumphs. There are exciting matches, but Scrabble is a game that provides the greatest enjoyment only to those who learn it at an expert level. As a spectator, the distinctions between the historic plays and the merely great ones are impossible to grasp. The uniqueness and complexity of the lifestyle that surrounds the game is the story worth following. This is where WORD FREAK succeeds brilliantly: detailing the intricacies of a subculture whose ardor and strangeness make it remote.  <br />  <br /> Fatsis' knowledge of the Scrabble world is hard earned. He lives the game, which is what allows him to explain its eccentricities to the world. Just hearing the bare statistics of the Scrabble life --- the hours spent practicing, the anagramming parties, the tournaments thousands of miles from home in run-down convention halls --- doesn't convey the depth of the obsession. Nor does it help to merely run through the foibles of the game's stars: the stunted social and professional lives, the strange religious beliefs, the alternative medical therapies. The genius of the top players is too subtle and their personalities too easily caricatured for anyone but a peer to see the beauty beneath the absurdity. <br />  <br /> Fatsis works hard to be seen as a typical Scrabble player, but he never quite blends in with his peers. His status as a mainstream reporter covering their world makes him a celebrity, and nearly everyone he meets is eager to help him however they can. Of course, their actions aren't entirely charitable. Scrabble players are religious and atheistic, excitable and stoic; they share almost nothing but a desire to see their game become more popular. They realize that the status of a game determines the status of its players, and they see Fatsis' book as a means to boost Scrabble's standing. Their hope is that Scrabble will one day reach the level of esteem that chess enjoys, because although it's widely known that Bobby Fischer is a little bit weird, a Scrabble player might reply, &quot;At least he's known.&quot;  <br />  <br /> Fatsis is aware of the extra help he receives from the Scrabble world, and he repays it with an ever more fanatical interest in the game. Time after time, he is told to &quot;do the work&quot; if he wants to improve. He does, and he does. Unlike chess, Scrabble has a massive back-catalog of information that must be absorbed before a player can achieve master status. There are hundreds of thousands of Scrabble words in the English language, and playing the game to its full strategic potential means knowing nearly all of them. The only way to learn the lexicon is to memorize it, and Fatsis practices his flash cards on the F train --- words like &quot;spaviet&quot; and &quot;diecious&quot; tend not to come up in day to day conversation.  <br />  <br /> Early in the book Fatsis decides that WORD FREAK is going to be a personal account rather than a scrupulously fair piece of reporting. Even the stories of the other players are often framed by his quest for their guru-like knowledge. But the inward nature of WORD FREAK is more than just self-gratifying. Fatsis' journey from Scrabble amateur to Scrabble professional is fascinating precisely because it's so personal. His love for Scrabble and his respect for its stars are contagious. Ultimately, WORD FREAK makes the argument that the genius and devotion we honor in more popular pursuits are just as worthy in less popular ones (Scrabble included). That Scrabble experts are neither respected nor rewarded is the central tragedy of WORD FREAK. That they continue anyway is the central triumph. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Fred Kovey <br />	2004-07-29

Like any kid her age, 13-year-old Sarabeth isn't sure what to think of her young, hard working, sometimes eccentric mother, but she is all Sarabeth has; her mother lost any sort of family support when she became pregnant with Sarabeth at 16. However, mother and daughter manage to form a semi-stable relationship and make a home for themselves in a modest trailer park. When a heart attack takes her young mother's life, Sarabeth is shocked. Left alone without a real family or a home, she moves in with Cynthia and Billy, two of her mother's friends. While trying to cope with the staggering loss of a loved one, Sarabeth finds herself dealing with vague feelings that she is intruding on Cynthia and Billy's life as well as confusion in dealing with her mother's estranged family and former boyfriend.  <br /> <br />Most compelling in GIRLHEARTS is the conflict Sarabeth faces when dealing with the reactions of the people around her. The relationships Sarabeth has with her school friends are strained as she becomes cynical and hard. Also, the tenuous friendship between her and her mother's old boyfriend, Leo, changes rapidly over the course of the book. These developing conflicts were intriguing, and I eagerly waited to see how they would work out.  <br /> <br />However, this was the best part of the book. Other characters seemed flat and lacked depth. Often, Cynthia and Billy's actions seemed pointless --- only occurring because the story needed to be moved along. Sarabeth was realistic only some of the time, and her emotions were often illogical and decidedly hard to believe. Of course, I don't expect to understand completely, never having lost such a close family member myself. Still, the story would have been greatly improved if there were more of a connection between Sarabeth and the reader. This might have been forgivable if the story had been stronger and the outcome more gripping, but because the story was not particularly extraordinary in those areas, it had no room for the uncomfortable flaws in Sarabeth's character.  <br /> <br />Still, GIRLHEARTS is worth a read. It is flawed, but it is a fascinating process to watch Sarabeth change and grow as her situation evolves.  <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Mary Crew <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-07-29

Fourteen-year-old Holly Faye Lovell has a dream --- she wants to sing, specifically on television, even more specifically on The Haverty's Talent Hour. But how can a poor girl from Biscay, Mississippi who has never even been in an airplane before make her hopes for stardom come true? The answer is contained in A MOTHER'S GIFT, the debut novel from pop sensation Britney Spears. <br /> <br />The story is a pretty simple one; we have all read books like it a thousand times before. Holly is too perfect and sweet and her life in Biscay is free of any pain or worry. She sings in her church choir and has a loyal, loving, hot boyfriend named Tyler. In addition to being all those things and a talented mechanic to boot, it is Tyler who scores her the audition at the prestigious Haverty School of Music, sacrificing their relationship for her ambitions. Holly (of course) aces the audition, even though she has no training and she fumbles through the process. And, of course, Holly is the youngest student ever at the school and given a huge scholarship. Once Holly gets to Haverty, located in cosmopolitan Hattiesburg, she is bunked with Lydia, a beautiful, older and rich student who (of course) underneath it all is unhappy and has substance abuse issues. The girl's adventures together teach them many lessons about life and friendship. Sickly sweet lessons, that is. <br /> <br />A MOTHER'S GIFT is not all bad. Some of the characters are cute and well drawn. In particular, Holly's mother Wanda and the ladies of her sewing circle --- Juanita, Ruby and the others --- are lively and seem like real people. Wanda's side of the story is told through entries of her diary and she comes across as very loving and kind. And then there is the surprise twist at the end of the novel that involves Wanda and the horrible birthmark she has on her face. <br /> <br />I've got to say, I had very very low expectations for this novel. After all, good old Britney is quite good at showing off her navel anddancing like a hoochie, but can she write? She can, but not too well.

The decision that resulted in this incredible book being released midway through 2002 was made months before its appearance, months before a young girl in Utah vanished mysteriously, months before a young woman in Washington, DC, having abruptly and involuntarily taken leave of family and friends, was found in tragic circumstances. That THE LOVELY BONES should have its birth in the midst of these events is, accordingly, happenstance. Any sensationalism imputed to Alice Sebold, the author, or her publisher, for the timing of it would be worse than wrong-headed; it would be deliberately and maliciously ignorant on any number of levels. No, THE LOVELY BONES deserves notice solely upon its own merits, which are considerable and ultimately immeasurable by any current standard we may have. <br />  <br /> Sebold has one previous work to her credit, that being the nonfiction LUCKY, a haunting account of the author's rape at age 18. THE LOVELY BONES is a haunting work as well, but in the literal sense of the word --- for the narrator of THE LOVELY BONES is a 14-year-old girl murdered during the commission of an unspeakable act committed by a quiet, monstrous man of such vileness that the reader wants nothing other than to reach into the pages of the book, grab him, and rip his face off. The victim, Susie Salmon (&quot;like the fish,&quot; as she tells us early on), relates her fate with a poetic matter-of-factness; she is at peace as she narrates, from her heaven, an account of what happened before and after her death as well as the repercussions of her death upon her family. What she wants is that her family achieve peace and that her murderer encounter justice.  <br />  <br /> What is most striking in THE LOVELY BONES, however, is Susie's description of heaven, a place of many things to many souls. Some of the places intersect in spots, some do not. One has only to wish for a good reason for something in order to acquire it. When Jesus Christ said &quot;My Father's room has many mansions&quot; He was talking about Susie's heaven. Susie is able to witness events on Earth without the limitations imposed by time and space, and can thus witness her family, friends, and murderer, and know what they are thinking and doing. Sebold's writing is masterful --- no, it's incredible. Although Susie's voice never manifests itself beyond a quiet peacefulness, her tale of what has gone before and what is to be excites a passionate desire to know what is to happen to those left behind. Susie's subtle delight in her burgeoning ability to influence things on this side of the shade raises hope that she will be able to fully realize her desire to bring peace to her family, who seem irrevocably fractured as the trauma of her sudden, senseless disappearance and passing lays fatal stress on already fractured relationships. It is, in the end, a false hope; but things have a way of working out in the end for how they are supposed to be, and they work out without Susie's assistance. Well, that's not quite right. Maybe she does help a bit. <br />  <br /> Sebold's bag of talents is large enough and complete enough that THE LOVELY BONES never even approaches the maudlin; readers, however, will be moved to tears several times during their encounter with this work. That Sebold is able to elicit sorrow, righteous anger, regret, and ultimately, hope through a narrative of events in a voice rarely raised above a peaceful whisper is a statement to the level of her artistry. If she never writes another word she will be known for decades for this work. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub <br />	2004-07-29

Now with work under way to rebuild her lost log cabin, she finds a skeleton in the dig. Along with the male bones, investigators find a butterfly necklace purported to belong to a young woman who disappeared more than 20 years ago. Could her bones be buried near this body? Could Jessie's land be another burial site used by serial killer Robert Hansen, who was convicted of 17 murders and is now spending his waning days in prison? <br />  <br /> This theory is ruled out almost immediately when the bodies of two recently murdered women are found in close proximity to the construction site.

He wants to create an &quot;experiment with life,&quot; one that none of them will ever forget. <br />  <br /> The five students come from all cliques in the school: Geoff the strong, Frankie the festive, Alex the meek, Mike the brave, and Liz the savior. All venture down into a long-forgotten pit inside the school grounds while the rest of their classmates are on a school trip. Their parents all assume the five are on the trip as well. Sound cool, so far? The five students have time on their hands, time to chill, party and --- become trapped in the scariest predicament imaginable! <br />  <br /> Martyn is supposed to pick them up three days later. When night comes on the third day, they realize he isn't coming back. And so the five unwittingly become part of an unimaginable mind game. Food, water, and then lastly light are taken away from them, one after the other. Fear, anxiety, hopelessness, and tension grow and threaten the five. Will they ever get out of there alive? <br />  <br /> THE HOLE, a suspenseful and electrifying novel, digs deep inside the mind of Liz, the narrator and writer of the novel. Liz's perspective becomes dulled and strange as the book continues on, due to the deprivation and horror with which she is faced. Is Liz telling the truth? What really happens?  <br />  <br /> THE HOLE compares favorably to such books as William Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES and John Fowles's THE COLLECTOR. If you like psychological suspense and crave a quick reading thriller, THE HOLE is the medicine you've been looking for. The uncertainty as to what really occurs is definitely what British author Guy Burt is aiming for, and he knows how to keep his audience captivated through different perspectives and personalities. How do five completely different people survive an incident so insane? You'll have to read to find out! <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Rachel, high school student and reading diva <br />	2004-07-29

At its heart, GIRL TALK is about a great fear shared by many women coming of age --- becoming our mothers. It shows how it always happens when you least expect it and that there is no avoiding it. But most importantly, by the end of Julianna Baggott's stunning debut novel, one has learned to accept this fear with grace and dignity. Just like Mom would want. <br />  <br /> Lissy Jablonski is almost 30. She is an ad executive in Manhattan. Her first love has come to stay with her and ends up marrying her stripper ex-roomate --- and Lissy is pregnant by her married ex-lover. The power of these events culminates in a comic flashback to what is know throughout the book as &quot;the summer that never happened.&quot;  <br />  <br /> Lissy was 15 years old that summer. Her father ran off with a redheaded bank teller, and she began to realize that everything she knew about herself and her family was a lie. Amid a cast of vividly drawn characters, Lissy begins to come to terms with the secrets revealed during her comforting &quot;girl talks&quot; with her mother. <br />  <br /> In an attempt to spare her daughter the humiliation of her father's moral misstep, Dotty Jablonski takes Lissy away from her New Hampshire life to the only refuge she can think of: the home of her rich college friend, Juniper Fiske. The Fiske family, including children Piper and Church, are possibly the oddest refuge for the Jablonski women during that fateful summer, considering that Lissy's parents met at Juniper's wedding. They are the type of rich people we all know: Piper is teenaged and sullen; Juniper, valium-addicted and high strung; and Church is boyishly handsome and impressionable. Perhaps the most compassionately drawn character, Church Fiske is the kind of guy that every girl has had a crush on, the kind of guy that stays with you years later, still holding onto the part of your heart that believed love was easy. When Church joins Lissy and her mother at their next refuge, his impressionable soul becomes forever wary of the life of excess he is used to. He falls in love with everything middle class and sets the tone for the man he will become. <br />  <br /> It is also in the home of Dino and Ruby Pantuliano that Lissy gets to know more about her real father, Anthony Pantuliano. A dwarfish man with a rather impressive body, Anthony is the first --- and seemingly only --- true-love Lissy's mother ever had. Although Anthony does not know he is her father, Lissy becomes attached to the persona of him. She has both been raised by a man who loves her greatly, and created as a result of a great love. The importance of these two men in her life finds its origin during that summer that never happened. Throughout the stay with the Soprano-like Patulianos, Lissy begins to form the basis of what her therapist refers to as an Electra Complex and to learn to understand why her mother is who she is. <br />  <br /> GIRL TALK is wildly funny and benefited much in this reading by being set in an easily identifiable era. With references to WHAM! and the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, it becomes easy to interpose oneself with Lissy. Statements such as &quot;My earliest word association with president is crook,&quot; make the novel both timely and timeless. We could be talking about Nixon, or anyone for that matter. <br />  <br /> Although the prose is not as lyrical as expected, it creates for Lissy a strong, clear voice. The characterization is topnotch in this novel, and although Anthony Pantuliano is drawn as less-than-perfect, the novel benefits from his failings. Lissy's mother Dotty is at times a bit of a martyr, but aren't all of our mothers? When you boil it all down, each of us can only hope to become our mothers in as graceful a way as Lissy Jablonski. May we all learn to accept the good and bad that comes with that transition, and may we all make it a bit easier for those around us with a little &quot;girl talk.&quot;  <br />  <br />  <br /> ---Reviewed by Josette Kurey <br />  <br />	2004-07-29

Sonya Sones was one of the first, and still the best. Her first book, STOP PRETENDING: What Happened When My Big Sister Went Crazy was a deep, sad and moving book. WHAT MY MOTHER DOESN'T KNOW is a little different --- it's just as good, just not nearly as sad. <br />  <br /> Sophie is 15 and as interested in boys as the rest of us. She finally gets asked out by Dylan, the boy of her dreams, and totally knows it's true love. But then she starts noticing weirdness. Like she's taller than him, he actually watches the movie on their dates, and he doesn't want her telling his parents she's Jewish. Sophie doesn't feel right about Dylan, but she also likes him and doesn't want to end it. In an attempt to find something else, Sophie begins an online romance, and I won't even tell you how that turns out! Let's just say it gives her the push she needs to move on from Dylan to...Murph. <br />  <br /> But liking Murph turns out to be a whole lot harder than liking Dylan. To put it bluntly, Murph is a total dork --- he's so uncool that people say, &quot;Don't be such a Murph,&quot; when they mean &quot;Don't be such a geek.&quot; So why is Sophie thinking of him every minute? And how is she going tell her friends that she likes the biggest loser in school? Deep down she knows that if she doesn't come clean with her feelings for Murph she'll be as bad as everyone else who makes fun of him --- but still, it won't be easy.  <br />  <br /> WHAT MY MOTHER DOESN'T KNOW is an honest and heartbreaking book about a girl being true to herself, trusting her friends, and having the strength to love what makes her heart happy. Sones's lovely poems are so good that I'd say she must be a poet first and a storyteller second --- except that her story is also that good! Sones really captures the nervousness of dating a guy, the way friends can get jealous, the sorrow at realizing that you just don't like him anymore, and finding the strengthto love what makes your heart happy.

Fifteen-year-old Elizabeth Clarry is not having a good first week of school. She has just learned that her dad, a pompous airline pilot, is moving back to Sydney after years of living in Canada. That wouldn't be so terrible, except he has moved to a really posh neighborhood and wants to make up for lost time by taking her out to trendy restaurants and acting like a boor. Her mother, a high powered advertising executive, is so busy rushing from meeting to meeting that she only has time to communicate via Post-it notes left around their kitchen. Well, that and sending Elizabeth faxes, trying to wring ideas for cat food campaigns out of her. The new English teacher at Elizabeth's school, aptly named Mr. Botherit, has come up with a particularly deadly assignment; he has begun a pen-pal program between her class and a neighboring &quot;tough&quot; high school. And then there is Celia Buckley, as in FEELING SORRY FOR CELIA.<br /><br /> Elizabeth and Celia have been best friends for as long as they can remember. They have grown up together from mud pies and make believe tree houses to the world of crushes and teen angst. Elizabeth is the levelheaded, strong and independent one. She has the discipline to run everyday and cooks pretty much every meal for herself and her mother. Celia is the dreamer, the enchanting fairy-like one who is always scheming. Both girls have been nurtured by Celia's delightfully dippy hippie mum who never discourages her flighty daughter. At the start of the novel, Celia has run away, joined a circus and is training to be tightrope walker. No, really. Elizabeth is left alone, wondering if she will ever see her best friend again, if she will make the track team, if she will ever get a boyfriend and be a &quot;real&quot; teenager.<br /><br /> This thoroughly charming book isn't a novel in the strictest sense of the word. Instead, FEELING SORRY FOR CELIA is a series of letters, notes, and postcards. Many of these come from the imaginary organizations that plague Elizabeth's thoughts. These bizarre but hilariously right-on missives come from the likes of The Cold Hard Truth Society and The Association of Teenagers and are expressions of her inner worries and fears.<br /><br /> The letters Elizabeth receives from Christina are very different.

It was already a big city at this time, and it was on the way to becoming the fifth largest city in America. There were thrift stores, barber shops, record shops, clothing, shoe, and liquor stores.

The book does have its dark moments, as when memories of upsetting events in her past resurface. Although Cyd has not quite resolved these issues by the end, she's beginning to be ready to talk. <br />  <br /> This first novel by Cohn rollicks along not only because of Cyd's incisive humor but also because of her whimsical dreams.

Robert Cormier's final novel, THE RAG AND BONE SHOP, takes its name from a line in a poem by William Butler Yeats --- \\"I must lie down where all the ladders start/In the foul rag?and?bone shop of the heart.\\" In this novel, Cormier explores the lengths to which a person might go. In the end, both of the book's main characters discover they have gone too far.       Jason Dorrant is 12 years old and something of a misfit. Quiet and shy, he is more comfortable around younger children than around his peers. For this reason, he is considered \\"slow\\" by people in his town. Jason has some friends, but they tend to be little kids like his 7?year?old pal Alicia Bartlett. THE RAG AND BONE SHOP reveals what happens after Alicia is discovered dead.       It turns out that Jason had visited Alicia the day of her death. Jason wants to do all he can to help the police catch her killer. He agrees to tell them everything he knows. The police, meanwhile, suspect that Jason is the killer. They turn to a man named Mr. Trent who specializes in interrogation. Trent has never failed to get a criminal to confess. He is especially motivated in this case --- a senator with an interest in Alicia's murder has promised to help his career if he gets a confession.      A good portion of the book takes place in a small, hot, windowless room --- the interrogation room. Cormier describes it in enough detail to make the reader as uncomfortable as Jason is while he is being questioned. The way Trent works is also detailed --- first he does everything he can to gain Jason's trust, then Trent tries to persuade him to confess to killing his young friend. At the same time, Jason struggles to understand both what Trent wants from him and what he remembers about Alicia's last day alive.      Cormier moved smoothly between the two characters' points of view, building suspense and driving the story to its powerful conclusion --- a conclusion with no winners.      Although the book is very nearly flawless, it may be one chapter too long. The final chapter concerns the aftermath of Jason's experience with Trent. It wraps up the book with a shocking surprise, but it also seems a bit unrealistic, taking a believable story and stretching our ability to believe it a little too far. The chapter is unnecessary due to the excellent job Cormier did describing Jason late in the book.      Even with the last chapter, however, THE RAG AND BONE SHOP, like many of Cormier's classics, including THE CHOCOLATE WAR, is a dark and fascinating book. Cormier died in November of 2000 at the age of 75, but THE RAG AND BONE SHOP clearly reveals that he was still at the top of his game, writing in his characteristic uncluttered style and making full and powerful use of his knack for revealing the motivations of his characters in this suspenseful and sad story. Part mystery and part cautionary tale, THE RAG AND BONE SHOP is a fine finale to Cormier's career.     (...)	2004-07-29

As I sit down to write this review, schools around the country are starting another academic year. For parents, this time of year may signal a reminder that time passes far too quickly, even if they are glad to send the little ones off. Parents of high school seniors may experience this pang a little more acutely since their children are just about ready to step off into adulthood. The seniors themselves are probably looking forward to being the top dogs, maybe finally playing on varsity, getting ready for the senior prom, and, of course, the college application process. While it's certainly not a how-to book by any means, both parents and students would do well to read THE GATEKEEPERS: Inside the Admissions Process of a Premier College by Jacques Steinberg, for it provides a fascinating and in-depth look at how one college selects its freshman class. <br />  <br /> Steinberg, an education reporter for the New York Times, spent an entire year with Ralph Figueroa, a senior admissions officer for prestigious Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. His reports initially appeared in the Times. Considered by many to be just a slight notch below the Ivy League, Wesleyan offered Steinberg complete and unfettered access to every step of the admissions process. Steinberg followed Figueroa through recruitment meetings with prospective students, the arduous application reading process, two rounds of admittance decisions, and eventually the wooing of admitted students. I attended a large midwestern university, which, at the time, offered admission to all graduates of any accredited in-state high school. Being an out-of-state student, I was held to a slightly higher standard. I believe I had to demonstrate my ability to walk and chew gum at the same time. So, I really had no idea of the extent of agony and debate that takes place in the admissions offices of these highly selective schools. Steinberg invokes empathy for both the admissions officers and the students.  <br/>  <br /> Steinberg masterfully creates a sense of community by closely following six high school seniors from application through matriculation. He is at his best when describing these students, all from widely disparate backgrounds. Surprisingly, no names have been changed. Steinberg reports their names, scores, hopes, and dreams with complete frankness. <br />  <br /> With permission, Steinberg describes students like Becca Janol, an outstanding leader whose adolescent flirtation with a marijuana laced brownie creates a nightmare for Ralph Figueroa and the admissions committee. He also follows, among others, brilliant, biracial Julianna Bentes, who scored a perfect 1600 on her SAT, and Jordan Goldman, a cocky aspiring writer. As you might imagine, the students agonize over their decisions, especially those who are, at least initially, rejected. We must remember that these kids are the cream of the crop. All of the students are exceedingly bright and most have ultra-supportive parents. I found it difficult to cry too many tears over someone who &quot;only&quot; got into 4 selective colleges and eventually ends up in the Ivy League. Some of the students draw this conclusion themselves, and it is refreshing to see the maturity with which they address their youthful shortcomings. <br />  <br /> Steinberg is at his best when describing the process and the students. At times, he gets bogged down in numbers. I felt I was drowning in a sea of SAT scores and ratings. Likewise, Steinberg spends too much time detailing the background of Ralph Figueroa. While relevant, it certainly could have been edited more tightly. The main message that Steinberg drives home is that there is no magic password, no formula of X test scores times Y grade point average plus Z extracurriculars that will guarantee admission. It is an imperfect, human process, fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your view. Steinberg treads lightly on the issue of race, clearly elucidating Wesleyan's affirmative action policies, however controversial they will seem to some. He forces the reader to address their own views as well, since Wesleyan believes they are obliged not just to admit the best students, but to find students that will fit best with their open (some might say too open) atmosphere. <br />  <br /> Even if you're not a parent of a pre-frosh, to use Wesleyan's term, you'll still enjoy THE GATEKEEPERS. It provides a glimpse into the lives of some interesting, high-powered kids. It's a fascinating peek behind the curtain into a process that is sometimes unfair, sometimes fatiguing, but always compelling. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Shannon Bloomstran (shanp@swbell.net) <br />	2004-07-29

There has been a lot of --- and I don't mean to be disrespectful to anyone here, but I don't know what else to call it --- a lot of blather about how Stephen King, with his last several works of fiction, has been trying to establish himself as a serious novelist, how he has lost his touch, that he should stick to what he knows, etc. I just finished reading the much-anticipated DREAMCATCHER. It should seal the coffin on all the nattering nabobs. It won't. But it should. King sticks to what he knows. He never lost his touch, but if we want to concede the (meaningless) point for argument's sake, he's got it back. And the rub about being a serious novelist...he always has been. DREAMCATCHER merely affirms it. <br />  <br /> Let us get one thing out of the box at the get go, here. If you gave your mom THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON and she liked it, don't give her DREAMCATCHER just because both books are by Stephen King and both take place in the woods. DREAMCATCHER is going to do for walks in the woods and hunting lodges what IT did for clowns, CARRIE did for proms, MISERY did for nurses, and &quot;The Raft&quot; did for farm ponds. No, DREAMCATCHER doesn't happen in yo' momma's woods. It occurs in some woods up in Maine where four men --- Beaver, Jonesy, Pete, and Henry, who have been friends since they were kids --- are enjoying their annual, and last, hunting trip together. When a disoriented man stumbles into their campground, however, troubles begin. He is bringing with him an alien spawn too horrible to contemplate. King, of course, contemplates it, describes it, and shoves it right in your face and makes you love it. <br />  <br /> I have been known to carry on at length about extraterrestrial visitations. My general attitude is that if a UFO should crash into the estates of Casa de Hartlaub, the pilot has about 30 seconds to demonstrate that it eats child molesters and pisses gasoline before I use a 12 gauge mop to sweep him into the landscape. And if it looks anything like Geraldo, he's only got 15 seconds. I have this attitude due to an extensive history of reading books like DREAMCATCHER. This is one nasty ET here, folks, and seven years of &quot;The X-Files&quot; won't prepare you for it. Your government, however, is prepared. Armed troops arrive, led by a no-nonsense, take-no-prisoners psychopath named Kurtz. Now let's make one thing clear here. If we get invaded, I want a psychopath between Them and Me. I don't want Phil Donahue, I don't want Quietly Effective, I want Armed and Dangerous. This is what you get with Kurtz.  <br />  <br /> The woods, with Beaver and Company inside, are quarantined --- but not quite tightly enough. There is one hope, however. Some 30 years previously, four boys befriended and helped Duddits, a young man with Down's Syndrome who, it seems, helped them even more. And he, along with them, is now the only hope that the world has. There is one problem, though. Actually, there are two problems. One is The Alien. The other is Kurtz. And they both pose a terrible danger to Duddits and his friends --- not to mention the rest of the world. <br />  <br /> Is this King's best book? No. Top 10? Yes. Top 5? Maybe. I might have to get back to you on that. But forget about its ranking; it'll keep you up, oh yes, it'll keep you up for a whole passel of nights and it'll make you sweat and laugh and stare at the guy with the vacant look in his eye who just sat down next to you on the bus. It'll also restore your faith in Stephen King, if you lost it to begin with. And it will definitely keep you out of the woods.  <br />  <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub  <br />  <br />	2004-07-29

This is a good thing. <br />  <br /> As all adults --- and most adolescents --- realize, the American teenager is a moody, capricious creature, occasionally subject to self-esteem shortages, peer pressure and all-purpose insecurity. And if Russel and his pals can put a check next to all of the above, well, readers will know it's a reality check. <br />  <br /> In an effort to write wonderfully realistic characters, Hartinger knows they must sometimes do things that are terribly realistic. So, despite knowing it's wrong, Russel, who's gay, at one point refuses to stand up for Brian, the tormented school spaz. Kevin, Russel's closeted jock boyfriend, joins his teammates in taunting Russel with homophobic remarks. Kevin's best friend Gunnar pushes Kevin into dating girls, despite the fact that he recognizes he's gay. There are scenes in GEOGRAPHY CLUB that will make your stomach knot, because you'll find characters you're fond of doing things they shouldn't do. It's a heck of a lot like high school. <br />  <br /> The purpose of the Geography Club at Goodkind High isn't immediately recognized by any of the gay, lesbian and bisexual characters who make up the club. Once Russel discovers --- via an online chat room (in another sharp bit of realism, he readily acknowledges an attraction to online porn) --- that there are other gay kids in his school, they start an official after-school group so they can socialize and talk about their concerns. They call it the Geography Club, trying to sound boring and nerdy so that they won't be found out: &quot;No high school student in their right minds would ever join that,&quot; thinks Russel. Clearly, there's a vein of shame here, a need to feel hidden and secretive about one's identity. While gay kids surely serve as a good example of this sort of thinking, it's hardly their private domain. What high school student doesn't at some point feel that she is hiding her 'real self' in order to fit in with her social environment. And what high school student (or adult) doesn't eventually feel the need to 'come out' from an inaccurate public persona. <br />  <br /> It turns out that the purpose of the Goodkind High Geography Club is a temporary one --- a short, important first step in Russel and company's longer journey toward accepting themselves. Throughout the novel, one senses that if these gay kids and their straight schoolmates were more comfortable with themselves, they would be less cruel to each other. When, in the novel's final chapter, the Geography kids officially rename their club The Gay-Straight-Bisexual Alliance, they begin a critical second step, not just in the coming out process, but in the growing up process as well. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Jim Gladstone <br />	2004-07-29

Then he meets a strange girl during a trip to the town dump with his mother. Razzle, named for the angel of mysteries, lives with her grandmother, brother, and a dozen dogs.

Harley has all the boys begging for her attention and when she begins to take an interest in Kenyon, Razzle warns him that Harley will eventually hurt him. Ken, being male, refuses to listen. He doesn't want to believe such a beauty could be evil. Razzle must then watch as Harley has Ken running in circles, twisting their friendship and getting him to make compromises with his photography. <br />  <br /> RAZZLE is both funny and touching.

First, her estranged father left her mother for good. Then he remarried a woman Shayla does not like in the least. But worst of all, he has a new daughter named Gift --- a daughter born on Shayla's birthday! Shayla feels as if she has nothing of her own any more, not even a special day. Her grandmother, her sister, and her mother all try to help Shayla. Grandma Augustine is a wisecracking wise woman. Although Shayla feels like her drama is unbearable, Grandma Augustine constantly reminds her to be thankful that she is alive and whole and smart. Grandma Augustine knows that Shayla can be melodramatic and so she gently tells her grandchild that her life, like most people's, will be filled with a little rain, but it's up to Shayla to make sure her sorrows don't turn into a big, overwhelming storm.  <br />  <br /> A girl who does have a stormy life is Shayla's best friend Kambia. (Their friendship was detailed in author Williams's first book, WHEN KAMBIA ELAINE FLEW IN FROM NEPTUNE by Lori Williams.) As this second novel opens, Kambia's life has only gotten more complicated. A year prior, Kambia was found wandering, alone and amnesiac. Adopted by the Dreyfuses, Kambia is caught in a search for her identity as well as having to find a place for herself in the world. Shayla must help Kambia heal, even as anonymous notes and packages start to plague her friend and bring her to the edge of sanity. <br />  <br /> In another subplot, Shayla befriends Lemm, the new boy at school who's lost most of his family in a tragic accident. Lemm struggles, feeling as alone and hopeless as Kambia and Shayla. Lemm also has severe problems with substance abuse, and even as Shayla tries to gain some control in her life, she finds she wants to help Lemm with his issues. Most of the time Shayla feels as if she's caught up in a world full of problems whirling about her, just waiting to reach out and snatch her.  <br />  <br /> SHAYLA'S DOUBLE BROWN BABY BLUES presents a harsh picture of contemporary life in the African American community. The families are strained nearly to the breaking point but held together by a web of women. These woman show their strengths and vulnerabilities while keeping life going, despite upheavals, dangerous events, and secrets from the past. Women like Grandma Augustine carry with them the promise of a brighter future, even when that promise seems to be withheld by violence and uncertainty; they never allow hope to become totally eaten away. By sharing her enduring strength with her granddaughter, Augustine demonstrates that it is possible to bear the shocks of life and, in time, overcome them. <br />  <br /> This isn't the kind of book you can say you enjoyed; &quot;enjoy&quot; simply isn't the right word. But it does tell a powerful story in tight well-crafted prose that lingers in the mind and in the soul long after the story has ended. Lori Aurelia Williams's characters are so solid, they seem as if they've been hewn out of rock instead of the airy stuff of imagination. It's the kind of book that makes you want to hold your own family just a little nearer, just a little dearer.

When Young Ju is four years old, she learns that her family is leaving their small fishing village in Korea to live in Mi Gook. Young Ju has heard enough about Mi Gook to be sure the place they are moving to is paradise, that she and her family are going to heaven.<br /><br /> After flying through the sky for a long time, Young Ju finds out that Mi Gook is actually a regular earthly place called America. And it doesn't feel at all like heaven. A STEP FROM HEAVEN follows Young's life from the age of 4 all the way up until she is ready for college, as we watch her change from a hopeful girl into a hardened young adult.<br /><br /> You think you had it bad growing up? Young doesn't speak or even understand English. She must struggle to become the &quot;Mi Gook girl&quot; her mother wants for a daughter, which means losing some of her Korean identity. But it seems that just as soon as she learns the American culture, her parents are afraid she has forgotten her past. Young doesn't want her new American friends to see how &quot;weird&quot; her parents are or the poverty in which they live, so she doesn't invite them over, she lies to both her friends and her family --- and instead of fixing the situation, Young only serves to make herself more lonely. Worst of all, her father's drinking is out of hand. The family thought he would stop when they left Korea, but he hasn't. In fact, he's gotten worse. Now here in America, where Young and her mother don't know a soul and can't communicate well, they feel as if no one can help with his alcoholism. Soon, Young fears for her and her mother's lives.<br /><br /> An Na weaves a wonderfully poetic first novel. Although grand in scope, the novel never feels overdone. The story is sweepingly dramatic without a trace of insincerity --- it feels real. It will open the eyes of anyone who is a part of American society, who has lived here all their lives and never felt like an outsider, and anyone moving here from another country will relate to Young Ju's struggles to learn America's strange ways. An Na is a talented writer who makes sure you know her characters inside and out. Everyone you meet in this book will work his or her way into your heart --- even Young Ju's father --- and you won't forget any of the characters anytime soon. Best of all is Young Ju, a confused girl who is also brave, kind and gentle. You won't escape the pain that Young must deal with every day, as her family struggles to break free from their no-win situation. However, Young sees the beauty everywhere, even in her harsh reality.<br /><br /> Look around. Is there someone you know who is a little different, someone who doesn't get noticed much? You would never guess it, but maybe they could use your friendship right now. A lyrical and beautiful book, this novel is a great read. It flows quickly, is well-written, and you can definitely learn from it. I know I did.<br /><br /> --- Reviewed by Kate Torpie	2004-07-29

Raven wants more than hanging out all day --- she wants to make a secure, good life for her son Smokey --- but she can't find where to begin. She tries to find a job, but her lack of a high school diploma means she can only find work in a fast food shop.

McDonald knows the world about which she writes; she grew up in a housing project then went to three highly selective universities after she finished high school.

I don't think I had been there but three weeks when a gentleman suddenly took ill and retired on sick leave. He died a few months later of brain cancer. Another man inherited his desk. He, too, was dead within a year from a tumor in his brain. A third gent was given the desk, and within six months, he also was gone, for the same reason. A number of us attended his funeral, and when we returned to the office, four of us, by agreement common and unspoken, took the desk and unceremoniously shoved it into a storage room where it may still remain. I have been convinced since that time that there are some objects in this world that for whatever reason are salted with a wrongness. Maybe it's a storefront where a business can never successfully take hold, or a piece of jewelry that seems to herald domestic problems, or something else. It's as if they're not meant to be here. But they are. <br />  <br /> One of these objects is the basis for Stephen King's new novel, FROM A BUICK 8. There have been some nattering nabobs of negativism who were deriding this book as &quot;Christine II&quot; before it ever came out. Nope, this Buick, unlike Christine, does not sell its soul to rock 'n' roll. Sure, you can't read this bad boy without hearing Bob Dylan's &quot;From A Buick 6&quot; floating in the background --- it even makes an appearance in the story. But the vehicle in this book isn't haunted. No. It's worse. <br />  <br /> This Buick 8 pulls up to some gas pumps at a full-serve gas station in Western Pennsylvania in 1979. While the pump jockey is gassing her up, the driver walks around to the back of the station and...disappears. The local gendarme, two Pennsylvania State Policemen named Ennis Rafferty and Curtis Wilcox from Troop D, show up and almost immediately notice that this car isn't...right. For one thing, the sumbitch can't be driven. And...it hums. You can't really hearit, but it's there. Troop D takes custody of it and they watch it. This is one Buick 8 that bears watching. And guarding. Whatever it is, it's not a car. Worse than that, it breathes. It exhales things out into our world and inhales things in to...who knows where. You don't want to know, and you don't want to go there. You won't come back. The car becomes Troop D's family secret, kept in Shed B and quietly but vigilantly guarded. When Wilcox is killed in a senseless accident in the fall of 2001, Ned, his 18 year old son, begins doing odd jobs around the barracks, trying to hold onto his father's memory. Ned discovers the car and the story behind it and he wants to know more. And the car is ready to give him far, far more than he will ever want... <br />  <br /> The first draft of FROM A BUICK 8 was completed shortly before King's infamous injuries at the hands of a careless motorist in 1999; there are a couple of moments in the book that seem to eerily prefigure what happened to King. The inspiration for FROM A BUICK 8 itself arose from another incident that I won't reveal here --- King does a wonderful job of it in his Afterward --- but accounts for the setting of the tale in Western Pennsylvania. King did yeoman's research here, hanging out with Pennsylvania State Patrolmen stationed in the area, and nails the region and the people so well that you'd swear he spent his entire life there. What is perhaps so fascinating about FROM A BUICK 8, however, is the canny manner in which King transports this...this car, which does not belong, into our world. As one of the characters indicates in FROM A BUICK 8, there are a lot of Buicks out there. It's not at all hard to imagine that there are objects like this, objects so strange we can barely imagine them, sitting out there. And waiting. You won't be able to read FROM A BUICK 8 without laying awake after ward and wondering about them. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub <br />	2004-07-29

Being a fan of Mr. Hiaasen's wonderfully twisted, weird fiction for adults, I was intrigued by the idea of him writing for a younger audience. Would there be a crazed, hulking idiot with a dead pit bull hanging off his arm? A roadkill-eating former governor? How would he present his somewhere-between-amused-and-disgusted attitude toward humanity in a manner palatable to kids? <br /> <br />I'm happy to report that HOOT is funny, well written, and enjoyable, even for a depraved old lady like me. The plot concerns Roy Eberhardt, an intelligent, resourceful middle-school student who has just moved to Florida from Montana. He misses the mountains and wilderness of Montana. As a kid who has moved a lot, he's not surprised to be the victim of bully Dana Matherson. While being pummeled by Dana on the school bus, Roy spies a kid running along the sidewalk, a kid with no backpack and no shoes. Intrigued, he sets out to find him and gets involved up to his eyeballs in the strange kid's guerilla tactics to save a particular street corner from its fate as the future site of another Mother Paula's All-American Pancake. The adults seem to be ignoring the burrows of tiny owls that will be buried by the bulldozing equipment any day now. Roy's parents explain that it surely is a shame about the owls, but the company must have filed all of the papers and received all of the necessary permits. But Roy and his new friends --- Mullet Fingers, the outlaw boy, and Beatrice, his tough, soccer playing stepsister --- are not about to take the destruction of the owls' burrows lying down. Along the way they outwit Officer Delinko, the ambitious cop who tries to protect the site, and Curly, the foreman who's responsible for getting the job started. <br /> <br />Roy's parents are thoughtful and very caring. Roy shields his tenderhearted Mom from the fact that Mullet Fingers lives in the woods and at the dump because his own mother doesn't want him. That's probably the most brutal aspect of the novel, unless perhaps it's the dishonesty of the Mother Paula's corporation in attempting to deny the existence of the endangered owls. Mr. and Mrs. Eberhardt worry about Roy and advise him, but ultimately, Roy figures out a successful plan on his own. <br /> <br />The book carries us along with a pleasing suspense and steady pace. The author provides neat encapsulations of each character's motivations that are often missing from adult fiction. (Presumably we can work it out for ourselves.) While it might be missing the extreme characters and profanity of his adult novels, HOOT still reflects Mr. Hiaasen's usual indignation over the rape of his native Florida. Roy is an appealing character, one who may very well inspire young readers to question authority when necessary and act to protect the environment. How subversive is that?

In another, he ups and moves to Wyoming and teaches the whole family to ski. In yet another, he sends middle-aged, newly sober Rhoda down the Wind River with her 12-year-old son in a canoe. He's frequently racist, often stubborn, but he's also fiercely protective, forceful, strong, and sensible. &quot;He was always turning out to be right, and when we abandoned the clear paths he wanted us to travel we were always sorry.&quot;<br /><br /> Ellen Gilchrist fans may have some trouble recognizing this older, wiser Rhoda Manning, but underneath the sobriety and wisdom, our favorite smart aleck still holds court. &quot;Watch nature videos. See who rules a group of chimpanzees and why. Then decide if you want your president to keep it zipped.&quot; Charmed as ever by Ms. Gilchrist's easy, droll storytelling, I realized that getting to know Rhoda over the years in these bite-sized vignettes makes Rhoda seem more alive and genuine than she would if I read an entire novel about her. This way we learn about her in bits and pieces, over time, the way we learn about people in real life.<br /><br /> There are Rhoda-less stories, too. One of them is sufficiently prescient of the events of September 11, 2001, that the author notes in a foreword that it was written in the fall of 2000. That particular piece features new characters, but the last story is in the voice of Traceleen, one of my longtime favorite Gilchrist creations. A former maid and current friend of a white woman she still calls &quot;Miss Crystal,&quot; the Creole Traceleen now studies yoga and Buddhism. These disciplines stand her in good stead as she confronts the nanny her niece has hired for her precious grandnieces and, later, this nanny's drug-crazed boyfriend. I've always loved Traceleen because she's so dignified and serious, such a wonderful counterpoint to the crazy, selfish behavior of her rich employers. &quot;I sighed. Once again lack of understanding had caused a problem. Could I find a way to set things right? It would have to begin in my own heart, as Jesus taught and I sometimes know.&quot;<br /><br /> These stories often have a fairy tale quality about them, and Ms. Gilchrist dispenses the lessons subtly and gently. There is real wisdom here, in simple, conversational prose. It's gratifying to see these characters settling down, to learn what they've learned. &quot;Why in the name of God after all these years have I decided this is funny? Because everyone lived through it. Because no one died or was maimed or had their lives ruined.&quot;<br /><br /> Nearly everyone in these stories is well-off, and some are very rich. The women are gorgeous and talented, if sometimes troubled by men, children, diet pills, Arab terrorists, and unwanted pregnancy.

Founder and editor of the popular 'zine, Pesky Meddling Girls, Jennifur has collected all her best beauty, decorating and crush tips into one swank volume. Twenty-something herself, Jennifur understands that twelve- to twenty-one-year-old gals crave sisterly, loving advice while they ponder the mysteries of their own lives and minds (and parents!). She is here to help every reader get motivated and change her situation in positive ways. You're the main attraction in this movie; you are the writer and the director. And the wardrobe mistress, and the set painter... <br />  <br /> Feel flummoxed on how to make the move to rad femaleness? These pink, yellow and blue pages are bursting with the info you need. Begin by sending &quot;Like&quot; and &quot;You Know&quot; and non-pesky curse words to the recycle bin. Jennifur has invented a very cool brand of lingo, mixing street and teen speak with the kooky/fancy stylings of Old Hollywood movies. She is also a big advocate of the vintage-plus-new-genre of make-up and clothing and she includes absolutely adorable paper dolls of herself and her lil' sis in their favorite gear.  <br />  <br /> Now, don't think Jennifur is just some know-it-all trying to tell you how to do it her way. The book is less advice column, more workbook. Jennifur knows what questions to ask to get you writing, journal style. For instance, before she even gets into what to wear and how to wear it, she includes a page for you to fill in answers to queries like &quot;List the things about your body that you know are totally cute.&quot;  <br />  <br /> She also supplies a ton of lists: books for glamour queens, groovy movies, fascinating women, and what to listen to while you are making yourself look like a real kitten are just a few of them.  <br />  <br /> I'm gushing a tad here, but I really love this book. It gave melots of ideas on how to improve my already pretty fantabulous life. Still not convinced? What if I told you that Jennifur has serious cred in the entertainment and fashion world? She is currently in the process of developing a pilot with Warner Brothers, she had a tres cute cameo as &quot;Nosejob Girl&quot; in the film Clueless and designed a shoe campaign for shoe maven Steve Madden. Jennifur also went bi-coastal, doing work for Anna Sui --- whom she interviews at length in this book --- and she also can count Drew Barrymore among her reviewers and close friends. This girl has brains, crazy creative ways, heart, and moxie.  <br />  <br /> It's time for every gal to join Jennifur and don a tiara, sparkly pink lip gloss, and a confident smile while waving to their multitude of fans (even the imaginary ones).  <br />  <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Lucy Burns  <br />  <br />	2004-07-29

There's murder and mayhem, plenty of dead bodies, a unique hair salon run by convicted killers, and a teenager trying to hold it all together in CLOSE TO A KILLER by Marsha Qualey.  <br />  <br /> Seventeen-year-old Barrie's mom Daria is a convicted killer who now owns a successful hair salon called Killer Looks. Many years before, Daria was involved in a protest at a nuclear power facility. She planted a bomb in a car, which went off before it was supposed to --- and she paid for this with 15 years of her life. Barrie's parents divorced, and her father married Melissa; Barrie lived with them during the time her mother was in prison. However, when Melissa wins a fellowship to study in Paris, Barrie's father decides that she should live with her mother. <br />  <br /> After a week of working for her mom, Barrie has to escape to the local bookstore and indulge her passion for books. It is not just the reading of them, but the smell, the feel, the collecting --- especially of old books, old photographs, and postcards. It is also the crafting of stories to go with the photographs and postcards. <br />  <br /> Then the murders start. Paul Worthington, the husband of a client, dies on a Tuesday afternoon instead of picking up his wife at the salon. Barrie starts to notice that someone is watching her house. Friends are beaten up and left for dead, another client killing happens, and Barrie is pulled deeper and deeper into the frightening events. <br />  <br /> The old photographs that Barrie collects become stories about killings. &quot;Barrie knew exactly what it meant. It meant that she believed there were many people who were touched and tainted. It meant that there were others who could never, ever go back. It meant there were lots of solid families that had been smacked apart, with pieces lost or cast away and ending up for sale at a flea market in Missouri.&quot; <br />  <br /> Barrie and Daria's house is broken into twice. The first time, chicken liver is smeared over the walls and everything is trashed; the second time, the intruder gets away when Barrie discovers him or her opening a window. Then Killer Looks burns to the ground. The murders are getting uncomfortably close to home, and Barrie and her mother seem to be right in the middle. Will they ever be able to trust their friends again? <br />  <br /> The book is a gripping mystery and, as usual for Marsha Qualey, exciting and packed with fascinating people and plenty of action. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Audrey Marie Danielson  <br />  <br />	2004-07-29

Let me pose a question, how long has it been since Francine Pascal has hung out in New York City? I ask this because of something that has irked me in the series, in particular in Fearless #13. Sam Moon, the apple of Gaia's eye --- or perhaps we should say the cruller in her Krispie Kreme box --- fantasizes that he and G could one day share a &quot;cheap one bedroom in the East Village.&quot; As a current New Yorker, let me just say that such an apartment does not exist. If it did I'd be living there. I've noticed quite a bit of this Alphabet City bashing, and although years ago it was considered rather seedy, it is now lined with boutiques, bars, and restaurants. <br />  <br /> Having vented my Manhattan-centric complaint, I will move on. <br />  <br /> BAD, the 13th book of Pascal's latest blonde heroine series, takes a new and unexpected turn --- Gaia is happy. You remember Gaia, the girl born without the fear gene and whose mother was shot in front of her, not to mention her best friend, and most recently, her foster mother. Why is Gaia happy? It all comes down to a boy of course, a certain cruller of a boy. After reaching across miles of misunderstandings, evil conniving, and heaps of bad luck, Gaia and Sam are finally a couple. Knowing the series --- this is not Sweet Valley --- I'm sure their trouble is far from over, but for a few blissful moments Gaia can actually be a normal teenage girl and get all tingly about making out with her crush. <br />  <br /> Before the two hormonally charged teens can get too chummy, new problems arise. Sam's friend Mike, whom Ella injected with dangerous amounts of heroin, is hanging on precariously in the hospital; and Loki, Gaia's evil uncle --- her father's twin --- who she thinks is actually a decent guy named Oliver, is scheming to get Gaia to come with him to Germany. In the meantime, Gaia's over-stressed father defies CIA orders and races around the city trying to protect his daughter. <br />  <br /> The final chapter of this harrowing story is one of the best cliffhangers yet --- is the man Gaia gets on the plane with Loki, or her father disguising himself as Loki? I have my theories, but you'll have to read the book to come up with your own. Despite the rather lame side story about Gaia's friend Ed and ultra annoying diva Heather, this latest Fearless book has potential to bring the series to an exciting climax. Just don't believe all the hype about NYC. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Dakota King  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />	2004-07-29

In light of the recent wildfires in Colorado and Arizona, THE BIG BURN is an interesting book, but it would certainly be noteworthy under any circumstances. The story follows two young men and a young woman as they encounter and combat the infamously ferocious Montana wildfires of 1910. Jeanette Ingold deftly switches perspectives throughout the tale to keep the reader interested in this well-crafted historical novel. <br />  <br /> Jarrett, the brother of a forest ranger, is on a quest to prove himself to his gruff father; Lizbeth, living with her widowed aunt, wants to preserve her adopted Western home; and Seth, a young black soldier, is dedicated to serving his country and overcoming racial prejudice. Apart and together, they transcend traditional teenage roles and attempt to save their homes from the fires that ravaged the Montana and Idaho wilderness during the summer of 1910. Some of the plot developments may seem clich (romance blooms where you'd probably expect --- close calls end with last-second rescues, etc.), but overall the adventure is unlike any other book available. This overlooked event in US history provides a wealth of excitement for a talented writer. The parallel stories of the three protagonists allow for several viewpoints of every episode; Ingold paints a comprehensive portrait of the true historical events of the period. <br />  <br /> Ingold intersperses the chapters with &quot;field notes&quot; chronicling the wildfires and wilderness firefighting from an objective standpoint. These sections are actually where she writes best and they are a testament to the thorough research that went into writing the book. Both historically accurate and dramatically engaging, THE BIG BURN is a great choice for anyone who is interested in learning about the phenomena of forest fires while also reading a great story. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Lowell Putnam <br />	2004-07-29

The Citadel is steeped in tradition --- a tradition that included a men-only admissions policy until a court order forced the school to admit a woman in 1995. That woman, Shannon Faulkner, lasted only one week. When her turn came, Mace was determined to make it to graduation. IN THE COMPANY OF MEN: A Woman at The Citadel tells her story bluntly and honestly. <br />  <br /> Most of IN THE COMPANY OF MEN details Mace's first semester at The Citadel. Freshman year is the most challenging year at The Citadel --- which is saying a lot since no year there is a walk in the park. Freshmen at The Citadel are referred to as &quot;knobs&quot; --- a reference to their shaved heads --- and are forced to live under the &quot;fourth class system,&quot; which greatly restricts their freedom and allows upperclassmen to make their lives miserable in a variety of ways. The year is difficult for all who enter The Citadel, but for Mace and the three women who entered the school with her, the challenge was infinitely increased. <br />  <br /> The school, its administration, students, and backers were all faced with hard questions. How short should a woman's hair be cut? What sizes do the uniforms need to be? How do you deal with a soldier who menstruates? How do you keep women knobs safe in an atmosphere where they are resented by their classmates, by upperclassmen, by alumni, and --- most oddly --- by the wives and girlfriends of Citadel students past and present? None of these questions were hypothetical for Mace. As she addresses them in her book, she does a fine job relating not only the actual occurrences, but her own emotions. She does not shy away from the feelings of helplessness that sometimes threatened to overwhelm her; nor does she turn her tale into a list of grievances for wrongs suffered, as she finds humor in many situations that may not have seemed funny at the time. <br />  <br /> Mace's story of perseverance, both mental and physical, is inspiring. IN THE COMPANY OF MEN is not, however, a prettified tale of adversity overcome. Mace's language is direct and occasionally peppered with obscenities, and her assessments of her classmates, instructors, and the upperclassmen are unyielding --- as is her assessment of herself throughout the book. <br />  <br /> Mace spends some pages detailing her second semester at The Citadel, including a moving description of the final challenges a knob faces before being released from the &quot;fourth class system.&quot; The two years leading up to her graduation are summarized too briefly. A more complete description of her life as an upperclassmen --- during which knobs were subject to her whims --- would have been interesting and would have provided a better transition to the graduation scenes that end the book. Nevertheless, IN THE COMPANY OF MEN is a fascinating look at The Citadel and at the kind of person who can make it from knob to Citadel graduate. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Rob Cline (rjbcline@aol.com) <br />	2004-07-29

This guide to writing is as meaty as a textbook and as fun as a Disneyland theme park --- it's like a guided journey into yourself. The author has learned firsthand the therapeutic value of writing and she offers an excellent guidebook to help you understand yourself better and become a healthier person through your own writing. <br />  <br /> Whether you write in your journal to express your emotions, fears, and goals, or whether you branch out into poems, stories, or essays, writing can help you learn that you are okay. It can be your place of refuge and illumination, your comfort from the stresses and confusions of your life. You can learn who you are and what you want to do with your life through writing. As the author says of herself, &quot;Most of all, writing brought me home. As I filled up journals, I felt my life had meaning. I felt I belonged and was welcome on the page. No one could ever take this away from me.&quot; This may well be the greatest value of writing. <br />  <br /> In the book the author discusses how to find your favorite place to write. It may be a space in your closet, a spot under a weeping willow tree, a table in a deli, or a quiet corner at school. Writing is one of the most portable occupations --- all you really need is paper and something with which to write. Along with suggesting how to find your ideal journal and even your favorite pen, pencil, or marker, she suggests things you can write and lots of fun exercises to get you started. You can freewrite your way into ideas, brainstorm your freewriting into new ideas, cluster your brainstorming, and sort your clustering, each time going deeper into your thinking until you've developed and organized an idea. While she explains how to write stories, poems, and essays, she includes definitions of all those terms you learn in English class, like the difference between tone and voice. Not only are her explanations easy to understand, but she also pumps you up to dive into her exercises and start writing yourself. <br />  <br /> You want something interesting to get your thinking started? Try imagining the story of Cinderella from the stepmother's point of view. What was Cinderella really like? Maybe everything wasn't all roses for her family, you know. Or try imagining yourself when you're 25. What will you look like? What will your job be? Move in your imagination to when you're 50! How will your thinking and attitudes be different? What will you know then that you wish you knew now? <br />  <br /> I recommend this book highly. An inviting format, lots of writing examples from teens, and tons of quotes and &quot;Did You Know?&quot; notes in the margins make it interesting to read. And writing really is better than just thinking about a problem, because thinking keeps everything in your head but writing it down empties it out of you and onto the page, so you're free from it. You also won't forget anything because you can reread what you've written. When you see the patterns of your thinking, you might be surprised to see some solutions to your problems as well. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Tamara Penny <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />	2004-07-29

She becomes a motivational speaker, traveling across the country to speak at conferences, and she is rarely home. <br /> <br />Lori is resentful of her mother's trips, always wishing that her mom was there for her, both physically and emotionally. Clumsy Chuck is busy struggling with teases and taunts from peers and constant nagging from his grandfather. The younger children don't remember a time when their mother was home for more than three weeks at a stretch.  <br /> <br />When Joan decides to make up for her absences by taking Lori and Chuck with her on a trip across the country, what will happen? Relationships change and secrets are uncovered as Haddix reveals an aspect of the bond between mother and child that not many people understand. Can Joan Lawson ever make it up to her children? <br /> <br />The book is written from three different points of view: Lori's, Chuck's, and Joan's.

Jason follows up his act with apologies, smiles, and flowers; and Leslie is soon on a roller coaster ride through relationship hell with an abusive control freak at the helm. <br /> <br />When Jason isn't forcing himself upon Leslie, he is hitting and threatening her. And when she decides that she's finally had enough, he threatens to blackmail her and even begins stalking her.

There's only one thing that keeps her from giving up: she doesn't want anyone to know that she's really a loser, like her family has always told her; she refuses to satisfy the few male cadets who seem to be waiting for her to fail.  <br /> <br />But as the six weeks pass, something begins to happen. She begins to see that she that maybe her family is wrong, maybe she isn't a loser. For the first time, Andi feels a part of a group. Amid all the screaming and punishment, Andi realizes that she is learning more than commands --- she is learning about a private community from the inside, a community she's a part of.  <br /> <br />I wasn't sure I'd enjoy this book because of its subject. However, I was immediately drawn in and found it a quick, enjoyable read. There are many scenes that involve physical competition that were so well-written I found my own breathing speed up as though I was competing. Andi is a great heroine, more concerned with reaching her own goals than living up to someone else's standards. Gabi, her one female friend, may be a bit irritating at times, but then you realize just how different the world of West Point is --- in the outside world, Gabi would probably be one of the more popular girls in the class.  <br /> <br />However, there were issues that were unresolved and left me unsatisfied. Andi's mom definitely seems to suffer from some mental illness, but she is instead portrayed simply as mean and angry. Andi never comes to terms with her family and, eventually it seems, decides to leave them behind as she becomes more and more wrapped up in the military world. The author never mentions how Andi feels about the real reason she is there: she is training to be a soldier, to kill the enemy. At some point, I imagine she must have grappled with this, since patriotic passion was never a reason for her entering the military --- so what happens when this reality hits her?  <br /> <br />All in all, an entertaining though flawed read.  <br /> <br />--- Reviewed by Kate Torpie  <br /> <br />	2004-07-29

He wants to tell the police that he'd bought the right to stay alive, bought it with nights of white-hot pain and days of aspirin-choked silence.

He is part of a family who loves him. However --- convincing Diane and Stevie that he is their long-lost brother is harder than he thought it would be. <br />  <br /> Just as he is beginning to think that maybe he can pull this off, Cougar, Pop's friend and accomplice, shows up.

Welcome to the school of hard knocks, Gary Paulsen style. Driven from home by the sexual advances of a drunken mother, a teenage boy closes the door on life as he knows it when he runs off in the dark of night. The 16-year-old boy, who goes the length of the novel unnamed, soon finds a job thinning beets in the fields of North Dakota with a group of migrant workers from Mexico. The boy is given little shelter, little food, and the labor is backbreaking; and the fees charged by the farmer for food (dry peanut butter sandwiches doled out by the farmer's crab of a wife) and the use of a hoe eat up what little he earns.  <br />  <br /> Before long, one of the Mexican men takes the boy under his wing and invites him to partake of their tortillas and beans. The boy marvels at the Mexicans' easy camaraderie and ability to transcend their intensive labor. Through them, he learns that good food, friendship, and a little music go a long way in easing the rigors of life.  <br />  <br /> When he's offered a permanent summer job on a nearby farm, the boy accepts after seeing the farmer's lovely daughter. Although he never gets a chance to speak to her, he dutifully plows the fields and does what is required of him without comment. The boy avoids town while accumulating quite a bit of money for his work, aware that the law may be looking for him because he is a runaway. A corrupt sheriff's deputy eventually rounds him up and steals his hard-earned cash, but leaves him unattended in an unlocked cell. Spurred on by his fellow inmate, a drunken old man, the boy walks out of jail without looking back.  <br />  <br /> Before his 16th summer is over, the boy has witnessed a fluke death, worked as a farmhand and substitute son for a widowed woman, learned the &quot;carny&quot; (carnival) trade and been initiated into the wonders of sex. What more could a teenage boy ask for?  <br />  <br /> Modeled on Paulsen's own life, THE BEET FIELDS is as simple and straightforward as you can get. Although certain readers might be sensitive to the novel's sexual content, this optimistic and honest coming-of-age story is sure to please Paulsen's posse of ardent fans.  <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Tammy L.

Newbery-Award winner Patricia Reilly Giff chooses this horrific period between 1845-1852 as the setting for her latest novel. Don't expect a book full of clich happy Irish peasants singing and dancing, catching leprechauns. Giff doesn't gloss over one gritty detail of a daily life where starvation seems imminent. <br /> <br />When 12-year-old Nory Ryan's family first settled on Maidin Bay generations ago, they owned the land they lived on and the house they built; the house that her family still lives in. Now, everyone must pay taxes to an Englishman, Lord Cunningham, who owns all their lands. Those that cannot afford to pay in cash must pay with livestock or --- worse yet --- land from which they then are evicted. <br /> <br />Her father is away fishing, hoping to make enough money to pay back taxes for the months he's been gone, and Nory's mother died long ago. Left to take care of each other, Nory, her two sisters, and her brother rely on their elderly grandfather to help get by. The Ryans are lucky enough to have two chickens, a pig, and their potato fields to help them survive. <br /> <br />One night, Nory is awakened by an awful smell that comes wafting in through the open doors and windows. Her grandfather instantly recognizes the smell of rot from the potato fields --- the potatoes are rotting while still in the ground. Even Nory knows what that means: They may actually starve to death. So begins Nory's struggle to stay alive. <br /> <br />Nory is a brave heroine, suffering through horrors that I don't think any of us can imagine. With death and cruelty all around her, somehow Nory's heart remains filled with a hopeful song: her father will come back, regardless of how long he's been gone now; her family will have enough money to go to America-together; she won't starve to death; and she won't let her baby brother die. <br /> <br />Nory's attempts to distract her brother from his constant hunger are heartbreaking. Even as neighbors turn on each other in a survival of the fittest, Nory remains true enough to risk her own life to keep those she loves alive. It isn't fair that a young girl should suffer as she does while still protecting those around her, yet that is exactly what happened to millions of girls just like Nory. <br /> <br />A glossary of Irish terms and a letter from the author make this eye-opening story even more tangible. I won't tell whether or not Nory and her family make it. Be ready for a book so well-written that you'll smell the sea and see the beauty in this fierce land and its people. But also be ready for a book so honest and frightening that you'll smell the rot, feel the exhaustion and the all-consuming hunger that each of the characters feel throughout. Believe me, you'll be happy to eat whatever is for dinner for a long time to come. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Kate Torpie <br /> <br />	2004-07-29

Set in the citrus growing area of Florida in the 1960s, ROOSTER tells the story of a boy named Carlos and a girl named Kady. Carlos is a boy semi-obsessed with chickens, hence the nickname Rooster. Kady is Rooster's madrina (godmother), even though she is a mere two years older than him. This year Kady is entering high school --- and we all know what that means: She wants Rooster to get out of her face, and he seems to be even more clingy. Just when Kady thinks all hope is lost, she meets Jon, who's everything she's hoped for --- cute, rich and exactly what she needs to escape Rooster. <br />  <br /> Sick of her family, her house, and just about everything else, Kady can't wait to go to high school. Having fallen in love with Jon and the life that he gives her, she can't be bothered with chores and whatnot. But what happens when Kady gets too involved and starts thinking only of herself? As she spirals into a world of lavish overabundance, she forgets how much she really cares about Rooster... <br />  <br /> In ROOSTER, Beth Nixon Weaver shows just how hard citrus farming is. More importantly, though, is the relationship between neighbors. Rooster must face the facts --- he cannot always depend on Kady, he must look to himself for support. Kady can no longer be &quot;O Mighty Protector of the Chickens.&quot;  <br />  <br /> Nixon Weaver's book is revealing and startling all at once. I began reading it with a snob's mentality. Why would I want to read this book about farming oranges? I don't even like oranges. But I gave it a try, and so should you. Just as Kady learned, there are some things that are important, no matter who they are, how they act, or what they're about. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Lisa Marx <br />  <br />  <br />	2004-07-29

What was I to think of this emotional novel entwined with a mystery? It turns out the novel wasn't what I expected. <br />  <br /> Francie is a quiet girl with brilliant red hair. Since her mother's death, Francie lives alone with her father and has few friends. It is the 1960s, when racism is rampant, but when Francie meets Ruthie, a young black girl, the two become almost inseparable. That is until the rest of Spring Gap begins to notice. As the town grows more conscious of the tight bond between the girls, people become more intent on splitting them up. <br />  <br /> Meanwhile, new developments about the death of Francie's mom keep popping up. How did she die? Nobody is really sure about that night, and not many people want to find out. So Francie embarks on a journey --- with Ruthie, of course. The two become trapped as they try to untangle themselves from a web of lies. They find that nothing is safe and they can turn to no one in their quest for the truth. <br />  <br /> In THE STONES OF MOURNING CREEK, Diane Les Becquets shows the reader what life in the '60s was really like.

Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman have struck gold yet again with their latest novel, DRAGONS OF A LOST STAR, book two in The War of Souls trilogy. Following on the heels of 1996's DRAGONS OF SUMMER FLAME, The War of Souls trilogy continues the arc begun with their phenomenally popular Chronicles series. The first installment, DRAGONS OF A FALLEN SUN, set up an epic conflict for the war-torn, dragon-beset populace of Krynn, 40 years after the close of the Chaos War (and even longer since the triumph of the Companions in THE WAR OF THE LANCE).     <br /> <br />DRAGONS OF A LOST STAR picks up where the first book ends. Faith, belief in the old gods, and spirituality are ideas that Krynn has not seen since the Chaos War. Yet now belief and hope are seeping back into the lives of the people of Krynn. A new age is dawning as the people look to someone who begins to unite the world behind one nameless, miracle-performing god.   <br /> <br />Mina has taken Silvanesti and sets her sights on the North, on Solamnia. It is there where the titular War of Souls will occur. An ally from times long past is desperately following Mina to find answers, perhaps even to find the nameless god. This friend is youthful once more, the result of ungodly magic, and has given up hiding in his tower deep in Nightlund along the river of souls. The final battle of the souls, long dead, who rise up to fight the Knights of Solamnia, is one that will never be forgotten and will inexorably change the lives of both the living and the mythic. <br /> <br />The book doesn't just concentrate on old friends and dead souls. The invasion of Qualinesti by the Dragon Overlord Beryl is given some exposition as well. The knights of Nereka, once sworn enemies of the elves, have risen up to defend their homes and, in the process, aid the elves themselves.   <br /> <br />DRAGONS OF A LOST STAR can be counted amongst the best works in the Dragonlance saga. The plot is atypical for Weis and Hickman and includes many twists that will change fans' perceptions of certain old favorite characters. The idea of the one nameless god is also quite an intriguing one. For so long, the peoples of the land have lived in a hopeless world, an Age of Mortals, and yet now they are faced with the news of godly magic and mystery. What will the denouement be for the people of Krynn?  <br /> <br />This book is a must for the Dragonlance die-hard. However, if you are new to this or the multiple interlaced series of Weis and Hickman, this book and its cast of characters (almost all of whom come from other books) will be quite confusing and ultimately not that satisfying. Go to [...] for all the info you could ever need on all the characters and books of the many series. Then try out a book from one of the earlier series, either the Dragonlance Chronicles or Dragonlance Legends, before you read this engrossing but complex book. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Josh A.

Brought together by a persuasive letter from their elderly headmistress, an accordion-faced wisp of a woman who desperately needs money in order to save the school from destruction, the women have traveled from all corners of the world; one --- Sheila Kohler, both the author's and character's name --- from as far as America. It turns out the returning women have one thing in common --- they were all members of the school's elite swim team, hand picked by the bronze goddess, Miss G. Why they are the only ones chosen for this reunion is a mystery that is unraveled by the end of the novel, which swings back and forth from present to past until the harrowing conclusion.  <br />  <br /> The swim team, as well as the rest of the students, all live in near isolation at this school in the middle of the parched desert sands of South Africa. Without mothers to sing them to sleep, stroke their feverish faces, soothe their tremulous tears, these girls turn to the only woman they can find --- not the withered headmistress or the embittered biology teacher --- but the most female, the most headstrong, courageous, outrageous, beautiful woman, the one in charge of selecting the girls for the swim team, the almighty Miss G. But just as fast as she selects them, she throws them away and picks new ones when the old disappoint her. The final 12 girls she selects are the same ones invited to the reunion 40 years later. All attend except two, but there is still someone missing. The luminous and distant Fiamma, whose mysterious disappearance years ago haunts the school and continues to eat away at the swim team members.  <br />  <br /> Fiamma was the golden girl, literally --- her long flaxen strands stretched out and curled like a Princess's. Indeed that's what she supposedly was, born from a common mother and a regal Italian father. From the beginning, the girls were in awe of this seemingly perfect specimen, her delicate milky white skin, large almost clear blue eyes, willowy limbs, and long plaited golden hair. Maybe the other girls would have embraced her if she even pretended to care what they thought --- but she didn't. Always aloof, reserved, and mysterious, Fiamma didn't indulge in their games or secrets, and the girls despised this. It's not until later that they wonder if she was only waiting to be asked. All the adults, however, were enamored by Fiamma's luminosity and heritage, including the headmistress and especially Miss G, who after seeing her streamlined body gliding through the water like a sleek vessel, bribed her with sweets to join the swim team. Fiamma reluctantly consented and became the fastest girl on the team --- and Miss G's object of desire.  <br />  <br /> The book most often hovers in the past, but returns sporadically to the present, always through the collective voice of the girls in what writer's refer to as first person plural narration, a deceptively familiar voice, which always keeps the reader an arm's length distance away from the true inner thoughts of the characters. Because of this somewhat vague narration, when the reader finally pieces together the puzzle at the end and the truth crashes over like a wave, there is a moment of &quot;How could I have not seen this coming?&quot;  <br />  <br /> There are secrets hidden in every sentence of this haunting and at times horrifying book --- secrets that you aren't aware of until you reach the final pages. It's an ending that makes you pause, and then flip back through to see what you missed the first time around. The tautly told story with its tropical backdrop of sterile humidity is in great contrast to the young women's budding fecundity. Fiamma's fate is sealed from the first page, but to find out what happened, you have to make the journey with her and the rest of the girls who have returned to their school, not entirely of their own free will, to confront the past and to ensure the school a future.  <br />  <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Dana Schwartz <br />  <br />	2004-07-29

US	18548250	R37OKKK4UZRPZG	1890862134	374579609	Finn	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Finn	In Matthew Olshan's FINN, the author doesn't so much update Mark Twain's classic, THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN, as use it as a device to avoid the PC police. It's a brilliant move, really, because it saves him from a trap that often plagues writers of teen books, i.e., how do you make good, nice, wholesome people interesting. And you can't, of course. Real people, even good people, think and do things that aren't so nice sometimes. In teen books, authors make their heroes safe to the point of dullness to avoid offending the reader, and more importantly, the reader's parents. By adapting Twain, Olshan sidesteps the issue. With just a nod to historicity, he can let his heroine badmouth various minorities without fear of reprisal. \\"Don't approve of likable racists?\\" he seems to be saying, \\"Well, I'm updating Twain here.\\"      In Olshan's modern take on The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn the hero is a girl called Finn --- real name: Chloe. Jim is now a pregnant Mexican maid named Silvia. She's not a slave but an exploited illegal alien; her dream is still freedom, but to the West not north. Other details remain the same. As in the original, the mismatched pair journeys through a fantastical slice of America, where danger and excitement surround them. Fortunately, Olshan doesn't water down any of it. The risks the partners face and the depth of human evil they uncover are starkly real; Finn suffers beatings, kidnappings, and attempted sexual assault.      As is to be expected in an adaptation, little similarities to the source material run rampant. Olshan chooses not to conceal them. In fact, part of his method is to throw them at the reader like party favors. The mighty Mississippi becomes a paved drainage ditch, an abandoned rowboat becomes a raft, and so on. All very cute; but beyond flattering the reader's literary knowledge, it doesn't mean much. Occasionally, Olshan uses ideas from the original book in more substantive ways, and the results are better. Finn daydreaming quietly beside her modern river, as Huck did beside his, is a genuinely bucolic moment that loses none of its power by being borrowed. However, these moments are few and far between.      That Olshan has chosen to adapt Twain is not surprising: Twain was a keen social critic, and Olshan aspires to a similar style. But Olshan lacks Twain's eagle eye for hypocrisy. He can spin a yarn, but his thoughts on \\"society\\" tend toward the obvious. Worse, at times he lets his opinions cloud his prose. Finn's appeal is that she's a straight shooter. When she gets aw-shucksy to highlight an injustice, things fall apart. \\"The fact that we were white seemed to make us invisible, which was the opposite of my grandparents neighborhood, where it's black people who are invisible. Wait, I take that back. It wasn't exactly the opposite. In my grandparents neighborhood they just pretended that black people were invisible. Black people are actually watched very closely there.\\" It's as if these sentences are backlit with flashing neon signs reading \\"meaningful content here.\\" The more Olshan strives to make points about the world rather than his characters, the thinner his insights become.       Finn is a wonderful hero, and a fully modern one, but FINN never lives up to its grander ambitions. Although the book is geared towards older teenagers, its brisk plotting and trendy subject matter make it a quick and enjoyable read for just about anyone; but it's insights will only be significant to children or young teenagers. As an updating of HUCKLEBERRY FINN, the book misses its mark. What makes Twain's masterpiece great is the world view it embodies and the grace with which it embodies it. FINN succeeds as a story but not as a work of social criticism. In the end, the prospect of a Huckleberry Finn for 2000 is left unfulfilled, and the parallels, which promised so much, remain just a device and an amusement.   (...)	2004-07-29

Your best friend is all crushed out over the cute boy in algebra and won't talk about anything else. Your parents have decided that you are grounded-again. What to do? You're tired of asking your friends for advice; it always seems wrong anyway. So one day you decide to check out the horoscopes in the paper. Sure, looking to the stars could be a little flaky, but it worked for the ancient Greeks, Romans, Aztecs, and Egyptians, not to mention Nancy Reagan and Elvis. Drew Barrymore and Gwen Stefani are also big fans of astrology and they can't be wrong, right? <br />  <br /> You grab the paper from the kitchen table, but, of course, the daily horoscope only mentions careers and marriage and that stuff you won't care about for another 10 years. Back on the bus to confusionville. <br />  <br /> I say, &quot;Worry no more.&quot; (Okay, you probably still have things to worry about, but this will help.) M. J. Abadie, professional astrologer and psychotherapist, heard the cries of teens and delivered to us her newest book, TEEN ASTROLOGY. Here are all the tools needed to decipher the heavens and their effect on you and your buds, 'rents, and crushes. <br />  <br /> The most interesting (and crazy making) part of being a teen is dealing with relationships, so Abadie places special emphasis on interplanetary connections. You will learn how to balance the outer, social personality of your Sun sign with the inner, emotional core of your Moon sign. Figure out your main honey's planet stats and compare them to your own; Mars and Venus work together in the weird realm of love. And let's not forget the very important and very stressful parental area --- maybe the whole reason why your Mom snoops on your phone calls is that she has her Mercury in Scorpio. <br />  <br /> Don't panic if you can't tell your Ascendant sign from a stop sign --- Abadie includes plenty of easyto read tables for research purposes. The book also has a lot of journal like pages, where you can write down what you are discovering about yourself and those people around you. And for the more spiritually minded, the book provides meditations and visualizations for you to take your esoteric knowledge a step further.

Troy, at war with the Greeks for over 10 years now, is a city imprisoned within its own walls. Each day the men go out on the plain to fight --- and their women wonder if they will ever see them alive again. Geras focuses on the women of Troy and the many struggles they have.  <br /> <br />Xanthe is nursemaid to Hector's son and also works in the Blood Room, the place where wounded soldiers are taken. When she cares for Alastor, Eros shoots his arrow into her heart, and she falls in love. Does Alastor feel the same? Xanthe's sister, Marpessa, who works in Helen and Paris's household, is able to see the gods and goddesses, but having this ability does not prevent her from being placed in the grasp of love by Aphrodite. Iason works in Hector's stable and is much more comfortable talking with the animals than with Xanthe, whom he loves. And poor Polyxena is caught between being in love with Iason and loving Xanthe. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, war is raging on the plain outside the walls, and the people gather together to watch, to support one another and to cheer for their heroes. But are the soldiers in charge of their destinies, or does Mount Olympus control the fate of the war as well?  <br /> <br />With the background of war, love, and betrayal, these four young people, along with the regular cast of characters of Troy --- Hector, Andromache, Astyanax, Helen, Paris, Odysseus, Achilles, and the gods and goddesses --- all come together in this marvelous book. <br /> <br />Can't remember all the facts about the Trojan War and the myriad gods and goddesses? Not to worry --- Geras gives you all the information you need to understand and enjoy the story. I recommend you start reading when you have plenty of free time --- you won't be able to put the book down. <br /> <br />Please note: Because of mature topics, including love and war, some material in this book may be inappropriate or objectionable for young readers. <br /> <br />  --- Reviewed by Elizabeth Pabrinkis <br />	2004-07-29

Most of the story is told by Graham Hayton, a teenager in England whose father designs computer software for sophisticated fighter jets. Graham's sister Matty also tells part of the story through interviews with a psychologist. The two children are witnesses to a series of bizarre and troubling events, some of which seem to have been caused by ghosts! Others are the work of live people with conflicting goals. <br /> <br />The trouble starts for Graham and his family when they move into Sentinel House, an old house that was once used by the British military. Their father's work seems to awaken the ghosts of the house's military past. Matty and Graham have several supernatural encounters that cause them to doubt whether their father's job is an ethical one. At the same time, some very real individuals are acting quite suspiciously around the Sentinel House. All of these events come to a head in a sensational trial --- Graham and Matty's father is arrested for treason! <br /> <br />OPERATING CODES challenges readers to think about war and the moral choices it can involve. Manns relies heavily on biblical passages to make his points --- in one key passage, Matty reminds her father that Jesus instructed his followers to love their enemies --- but avoids a preachy tone. A message of peace leaps off the pages, however, and is particularly thought-provoking at the moment, given the events of September 11th and after. <br /> <br />Despite these engaging questions and a plot built around the supernatural and other mysterious happenings, OPERATING CODES is a surprisingly slow-moving book. Graham tells his story in great detail and with a lot of foreshadowing designed to build suspense. But in a story built around moral questions, a more straightforward narrative style might have kept the story moving along better. Between philosophy and foreshadowing, some of the suspense and energy of the story is lost. <br /> <br />Still, OPERATING CODES has a lot to recommend it --- a ghost story, a trial, an adventure on an abandoned military base, a fictionalized history lesson. Readers will find the book challenging in a number of ways and enjoyable in nearly as many. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Rob Cline <br />	2004-07-29

Her weapon of choice: a computer (although she is a dead shot with a blaster). Her name is Raven, and she is a Hex, which makes her existence illegal. Hexes aren't supposed to live past their first breath of life, but some survive until their gifts become apparent and then they are killed. When Raven was nine, she realized that she was a Hex, and having no desire to die, she hid herself in the ganglands and evaded death by hacking into the main computers and telling them that she didn't exist. This isn't too hard for her, because a Hex's power lies in his or her ability to enter a computer and roam around the Net the way most people enter a room and walk around. Whenever she wants to appear in public, Raven simply creates a false identity for herself and tells the computer that it is legit. This ability makes her the ultimate hacker. <br />  <br /> Now, thanks to a stunt Raven pulled six months ago while rescuing her sister --- now known as Revenge --- along with two other Hexes, Ali and Luciel, she stopped being invisible and became Europe's most wanted criminal. Dr. Kalden, a scientist who specializes in running unthinkable experiments on young Hexes can't wait to get his hands on the girl. It won't be long before his wish is granted. With Raven out of action, it is up to her brother, Wraith, to pursue an alliance with the rebel group Anglecynn. And Ali, who spent the first 18 years of her life as a spoiled rich kid, must lead a tiny group into a battle against the European Confederation itself. <br />  <br /> Rhiannon Lassiter's HEX: Shadows is a worthy sequel to HEX. What makes Lassiter such a great author is her characters. Raven is one of the most interesting protagonists that I have ever come across. She's not a particularly good person, she doesn't really care about other people. In any other book she probably would be the bad guy. The only reason she isn't is that the &quot;bad guy&quot; in the HEXseries is Kalden, who is much, much worse than Raven. Plus, Raven, for all her faults, has a lot of integrity, which makes her an interesting blend of good and evil --- and makes the HEX series one of the best science fiction series I have ever read. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Kathy Hale <br />	2004-07-29

Well, Baby Girl has the sight --- she can see everyone's future...except her own.  <br /> <br />But she doesn't need sight to see that her own father wants her dead. He's jealous of how close she is to her mother; Baby Girl even looks just like her, which is a good thing, since her father looks like a walrus. She just wishes she could tell what he will do to her next. Then one night Baby Girl and her mother sneak out, run off, and the future seems more uncertain than ever. Now, Baby Girl must use her sight to help them survive their new lives.    <br /> <br />Settling in a far away town, Baby Girl can't wait to start school and meet new friends who will love her like everyone at home did.

For the first time, Baby Girl begins to doubt herself. Worst of all, she falls in love. Will anyone love her back? Not even she can tell.    <br /> <br />SIGHTS is a sad novel about the harsher side of life. Baby Girl shows remarkable strength against the huge odds she faces. Besides dealing with being different, she has to worry about her father, not having enough money, and alienation --- and sometimes her gift feels more like a curse. Everyone can relate to the desire to fit in, although Baby Girl is right: she's special, and there's no way she'll ever be average. What happens to Baby Girl is pandemic. As little kids, everyone knows they're wonderful, but once they grow up a little, they begin to have self doubt. It's too bad that people lose that feeling, and it's tough watching Baby Girl go through it.   <br /> <br />The ending of SIGHTS really sneaks up on you. It's graphic and a little disturbing, but like the rest of the novel,the author doesn't cut corners when it comes to portraying violence.

As a worker in a coal mine in the years leading up to World War I, Tommy spends the majority of his time in the dark and emerges from the mine covered in coal dust. His widowed mother spends her days doing laundry for the both the miners and mine owners, trying to wash out the blackness. In Gloria Skurzynski's novel, ROCKBUSTER, Tommy rises above the various hardships that threaten to overwhelm him and refuses to see the world in simple black and white. Instead, he looks beyond the stereotypes that cause conflicts between miners and mine owners. <br /> <br />Tommy's life is punctuated by tragedy. First, his father was killed in a mining accident. Then, on the way to the trial of a union leader, Tommy's beloved uncle is killed by Pinkerton detectives for his part in various union activities. As if that weren't enough sadness for one young life, Tommy's mentor, Peter, loses a leg in a mining accident. Through all of these trials, as well as through a layoff at the mine, Tommy is sustained emotionally and financially by his talent for playing the guitar and singing. Indeed, Tommy is so talented that he is chosen as the new voice for the union --- after union hero and folk singer Joe Hill is condemned to death. <br /> <br />Joe Hill is a historical figure whose real-life trials provide an important backdrop to the action of ROCKBUSTER. One of the great strengths of the book is the subtle ways in which Skurzynski reveals historical detail. Instead of filling the pages with all the things she discovered about early 20th century coal mining towns, Skurzynski lets the details work into the story naturally. From small details (Tommy's search for an outhouse after a snow storm) to larger historical events (Tommy attends the trials of Hill), Skurzynski teaches history without slowing the story. <br /> <br />That's good, because Tommy's story is a good one. While it is made up of some fairly common themes --- young man overcomes hardship to help his family, win the girl and discover his destiny --- Tommy is a compelling character whom the reader comes to see as a friend. His joys and sorrows are felt by the reader, and his indecision about his future is agonizing for the reader as well. His commitment to bridging the gap between the haves and the have-nots leads to a logical and satisfying conclusion to the novel. <br /> <br />ROCKBUSTER succeeds on both historical and narrative levels and should be enjoyed by anyone drawn to strong characters and good storytelling. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Rob Cline (RJBCline@aol.com) <br />	2004-07-29

KLEOPATRA brings my lifetime total all the way up to two. That I finished it at all is miraculous, but that I enjoyed it immensely is testament to its brilliance. The pages of KLEOPATRA are as entertaining as the scenes of a well-directed movie; and for those of you who are fans of the film medium, the motion picture rights have already been snatched up by Warner Bros., with the author slated to write the screenplay. <br /> <br />In her book, Karen Essex breathes life into the ancient world at the dawn of the rise of the greatest Roman emperors, imbuing the peoples of that time with multidimensional personalities and all the frailties that go along with being human. Richly detailed images of Kleopatra's Alexandria and the decadent city of Rome are painted with a stunning word pallet. The author's decade of travel, research, and rewriting have paid off, forming a compact biography chockfull of history softened by a thread of romance deftly woven through the tale. <br /> <br />Although it is possible some readers may find themselves repelled by descriptions of atrocities committed against the citizens, Ms. Essex indulges in no gratuitous gore. The Rome of Julius Caesar was, after all, a fearsome and often barbaric place, not Hollywood's imagined Empire. Nor was the mortal Kleopatra akin to her most famous portrayer, Elizabeth Taylor. Far from the seductress depicted on the big screen, the Queen of Egypt was a savvy political power, shrewd strategist and cunning diplomat. At once highly intelligent and clear-sighted, she occasionally demonstrated the youthful naivete of her chronological years --- but quickly learned from her mistakes. <br /> <br />The author introduces us to Kleopatra at age three, already a precocious and observant child. We are at her side through her struggles with her beautiful half-sister/stepmother and her treacherous sister cum usurper of the crown. The gods smile upon thefetching young woman, the favorite of her father, King Ptolemy XII. Between her astute advisors and her personal visions, Kleopatra chooses the path that takes her into exile with the king, saving her from certain death at the hands of her own flesh and blood, and building alliances that ultimately benefit her reign and Egypt. As she grows and continues to master the many languages she spoke, she gains favor with the masses as ruler alongside her father and pours the foundation for her reputation of being a compassionate and fair queen. No previous account has doubted her courage, but her loyalty to her two lovers has often been cast in shadows, the blame for their downfall landing squarely on her head. Ms. Essex promises to explode that myth. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this novel, the first of two volumes, ends just short of Kleopatra's initial encounter with Julius Caesar at age 22. As it ends, she is grappling with her 12-year-old brother/husband, King Ptolemy XIII, for control of the throne. Volume II, PHARAOH, isn't due to hit bookstores until a year from now. In the meantime, we can savor KLEOPATRA slowly, time and again, luxuriate in Ms. Essex's prose and impatiently await the release of the sequel.

Down in the depths of London, where even the police won't go, are the ganglands, a place where the group with the most gun power rules. It is here that one will find the Ghosts, a gang so silent that nobody ever has seen one of its members yet so powerful that when another gang starts invading Ghost Territory, they will always lose, and always have a run of bad luck with the police (also known as the Seccies). It should come as no surprise to anybody who has read the prequels to HEX: Ghosts that Raven and the other Hexes along with the terrorist group Anglecynn are at the head of this gang.  <br /> <br />Now if you are new to this series, a Hex is a person who has been genetically enhanced to be able to enter his or her mind into the Internet and roam around like a fish in water. They can bypass security and make changes to any computer without its user knowing. This makes them the ultimate hacker. Their very existence is illegal and being a Hex is punishable by death. Most Hexes don't make it out of childhood.  <br /> <br />Two years have passed since Raven escaped the Federation and killed Dr. Kalden, a scientist who performed horrific experiments on Hexes, and much has happened. Raven is striving to find and train another Hex who is as powerful as she. Luciel, who was one of the first Hexes that Raven ever rescued, works to save other Hex children from the CPS. It is these children that make up the bulk of the Ghosts. <br /> <br />However, the Hexes cannot stay in hiding forever, so Alaric, former leader of Anglecynn, is now planning an attack on the Federation that, if successful, will bring down the government for good and allow Hexes their freedom. <br /> <br />Overall this is a strong finish to what has been an excellent sci-fi/fantasy trilogy. There are a few weak points --- two new characters named Gift and Talent are the children of a woman named Harmony Freedom, which is just incredibly cheesy. There is also one part of the ending that is so unrealistic (even considering that the book is a fantasy set in a futuristic world) it almost killed the entire book. However, many of the strong points that make the first two books of this trilogy great are present in HEX: Ghosts. For one thing, Rhiannon Lassiter has a real flair for atmosphere. She manages to convey how tense things are without constantly saying how tense things are. Plus the characters are just great. Raven and her brother, Wraith, are two of the most interesting characters that I have seen in a sci-fi/fantasy story in quite a while. These two characters help make HEX: Ghosts the coolest bit of sci-fi/fantasy that I have ever read. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Kathy Hale <br />	2004-07-29

The story builds suspense steadily until the end.<br /><br />Remarkably, author Christopher Paolini began writing ERAGON at the age of 15. Now 19, he has already established himself as an exciting new creator whose influences include Tolkien, McCaffrey, and others. His world is intricate, his characters believable, and his writing engaging.<br /><br />Both casual readers and hardcore fans of fantasy and science fiction novels will be enchanted by this well-crafted fantasy and unquestionably will look forward to parts two and three of this exciting trilogy.<br /><br />  --- Reviewed by Amy Alessio	2004-07-26

Taylor is growing obsessed with all of these things because she needs to keep up with her new friend, Kat. Taylor has other friends, Sophie and Sam, but they're not as cool as Kat, and they seem to be doing more and more things together without her. For Sam and Sophie shopping is fun, a way to occupy their time during a boring Saturday afternoon, but for Kat it's an obsession. Not long after she meets Kat, Taylor finds herself loaning Kat household money to buy clothes and spending way more than she should just to keep Kat as her friend. Kat's world, like much of the book, is superficial, and there's most definitely a lesson to be learned about what makes a real friend. <br /> <br />Though Judy Waite tries to infuse a serious tone and angst in the form of Taylor's dead sister and catatonic, incoherent mother, she leaves the reader confused as to why Taylor's life is so unusual, since Taylor's secret is not revealed until the end of the book. Everyone around Taylor comes off as flat and underdeveloped, except for her loving grandfather. The descriptions of clothes and makeup often go overboard, and not enough time is given to more important issues, such as Kat's obviously less-than-perfect home life. Like a Nordstrom's shoe sale that has nothing left in your size, SHOPAHOLIC is a book that makes a lot of promises but ultimately doesn't deliver. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Carlie Kraft <br />	2004-07-26

High school senior Becky and her best friend Abby are aspiring comediennes who work on their material and stand before San Francisco audiences to deliver it a few times a week. At one event, Becky meets Kip. She has not attracted a boy's attention like this before, and soon they are inseparable. But Kip begins to grow possessive and violent. Most of the time, though, he is wonderful and Becky loves him. What should she do? <br />  <br /> Janet Tashjian, author of the wonderful THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO LARRY, builds suspense in this realistic title. The story of Becky and Kip is set against Becky's fascinating stand-up career. Readers will see that anyone can find himself or herself in this situation. A note from the author at the end cites a study from the Journal of the American Medical Assocation where &quot;one in every five&quot; teenage girls is physically abused by her boyfriend, showing that the subject needs more discussion. <br />  <br /> Becky is not simply a wimp who submissively goes along with an abusive boyfriend. It's not black-and-white, and Tashjian does a good job of providing three-dimensional characters who readers will care about. Becky and Kip are in love, and she is more confused than anything else. But she cannot live a normal life while she is with him. When she is asked to go on a tour of comics that will be filmed for MTV, she honestly thinks Kip will be happy and supportive. When things come to a dangerous head, readers will not be surprised. <br />  <br /> FAULT LINE is an excellent book that should be both read and discussed. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Amy Alessio <br />	2004-07-26

She's very bright and her mother has taught her how to read and write, which has become an Abomination Unto Nuggan, the local god. She tends her father's bar and understands the business, but in Borogravia --- ruled by the tyrannical god Nuggan and his human counterpart, The Duchess --- no woman can actually operate a business because that too is an Abomination Unto Nuggan. Art, music, jigsaw puzzles and rocks have also recently been declared as Abominations in a rapidly deteriorating country that is losing its war. <br />  <br /> The trouble is that her brother Paul, the only legal heir to the lucrative pub, is off to the wars with neighboring Ankh-Morpork, who has been captured or is perhaps dead, so Polly's future looks rather bleak. Paul is a gentle soul by nature, an artist who of course can't practice his craft due to Nugganism and has no head for business. With him installed as legal owner ... well, you see Polly's problem. She needs to find Paul, bring him home, and set him up as owner so she can secure her future --- or else it's the Workhouse (or worse) for Polly. <br />  <br /> So she crops her hair, dresses up like a boy, and runs off to join the regiment. This is of course an Abomination Unto Nuggan, but Polly is nothing if not resourceful and with the quiet help of someone who whispers helpfully from behind a wall when she's relieving herself in the privy that a carefully placed pair of socks might fool the casual onlooker, Polly becomes Oliver Perks and her adventures begin. Polly, cum Oliver, takes her duties as a private seriously. When she finds herself feeling aggressive and even belligerent, she blames it on the socks. In fact, after cursing or belching she often thinks to herself, &quot;It's the socks talking, there.&quot; <br />  <br /> Her fellow soldiers in the Monstrous Regiment consist of (remember this is Discworld) a motley assortment of what's left of Borogravian young manhood: a Troll, a vampire, an Igor (Igors are a special class of being on Discworld --- they make excellent field medics because of their skills in stitchery and, er, recycling body parts). Also enlisted are three other young lads, all under the eagle eye of Sergeant Jackrum, veteran of legendary battles and the stuff folk songs are made of. <br />  <br /> This extraordinarily amusing book is a homage to Terry Pratchett's huge following of well-educated women, which make up a surprising majority of his vast readership. In fact, until J. K. Rowling came along, Pratchett held something of a record in book sales in Great Britain, acquiring an O.B.E. in literature from the Queen. He has caught on in a big way with American readers who enjoy his droll satire. Only a few of the books in the 28 volume-series on Discworld feature women. The Wyrd Sisters (a group of erstwhile Witches), Angua (a female werewolf in Ankh Morpork's Watch) and Commander Vimes's wife are among the few female protagonists. With MONSTROUS REGIMENT, we are introduced not only to Polly Perks but also to some other rather astonishing heroines. Elaborating on them though would spoil the tale. <br />  <br /> Pratchett has outdone himself with MONSTROUS REGIMENT --- a feat that might be hard to imagine after so many books. It is fresh, witty as ever, and brings a whole new look to Ankh Morpork. One might be tempted to compare this tale to our conflict in the Middle East, if one was of a mind to take Pratchett with more than a grain of salt. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Roz Shea <br />  <br />	2004-07-26

THE DISTANCE FROM NORMANDY is the long-awaited sophomore novel from Jonathan Hull, whose debut effort, LOSING JULIA, is one of my favorite books. Once again Hull engages and envelops readers in his story. <br /> <br />As the book opens, Mead, a World War II veteran with harrowing memories of the Battle of Normandy, is living alone in California. He misses his wife, who died of cancer. He copes with the realities of old age, and he spends a lot of the day nostalgic about the past. <br /> <br />His world is rocked one day when his daughter, Sharon, a single mom, calls to inform him that his only grandchild, Andrew, has been booted from school for brandishing a penknife at a bully. Andrew is coping badly with the suicide of his best friend, Matt, and could benefit from some stability in his life in a new place. Mead offers to have his grandson spend three weeks of summer vacation with him. His goal: to get Andrew back in line. <br /> <br />As soon as Andrew arrives, their worlds collide. Mead lives his life with the orderliness of the Army, while Andrew is a typical teen, prone to wearing loose fitting clothes, lying on his bed listening to music and daydreaming about girls. His grandfather cannot relate to Andrew and reflects back on his own youth that was defined by war, comrades who blew up around him and life that was all too real. <br /> <br />Mead and Andrew strike a measured relationship. They test each other endlessly. While there is an essence of caring between them, there is a gap in their rapport that has been bred by physical and emotional distance. Neither is warm; both are hurting. Each is trapped in his own memories --- Andrew of wishing he had been able to save Matt, and Mead of war and an incident in Normandy that haunts him. <br /> <br />One day while rummaging around the house while Mead is out, Andrew finds an old German Luger, which is a souvenir from the war along with some other war momentoes. Shortly after this Andrew gets himself into more trouble and Mead makes a decision to take him to Normandy to show him the world he knew with a goal to sharpen him up about history, and what mattered. This trip to Europe --- and into the past --- brings secrets to the surface for both of them. <br /> <br />While plot and storyline are critical to any book's success, Hull's true skill comes from how he writes character and emotion. His style captivates his readers and immediately draws them into the story. As he did in LOSING JULIA, Hull captures the indignity of growing old. Here he also captures the pressures of being young. <br /> <br />There are many comedic moments as these two generations collide. The first night Mead buys huge steaks for dinner only to learn that his grandson is a vegetarian. Their first trip to the California beach together pairs this aging codger with a penchant for embarassing bathing attire with his grandson who is a slave to his raging hormones and a teen's desire to fit in. <br /> <br />Some of the best dialogue surrounds Andrew's matchmaking attempts to bring his grandfather and Evelyn, the woman across the street, together. Mead is his usual curmudgeony self about this. Andrew is tenacious in his efforts. The story here takes a twist that this reviewer found extraneous, but delivered some imagery that wrapped the book nicely. <br /> <br />I read this book four months before tapping out this review, yet I still find myself smiling as I think about it. It's not LOSING JULIA, but it is a book that I recommend heartily. And as I read the last page, I eagerly looked forward to Hull's next title.

Just sixteen years old, Pagan has had a very checkered life, one full of hardship, cruelty and vice. He has little reason to trust people, find goodness in them, or even grow attached to them. Jerusalem in 1187 is a city of holy places on the one hand and a city of beggars, thieves, corruption and poverty on the other. Pagan finds himself in the employ of the almost saint-like Templar knight Lord Roland Roucy de Bram. Pagan calls his new master &quot;Saint George,&quot; as he finds it difficult to accustom himself to the pure and honorable ways of the knight. Pagan himself views the world in a very different light, seeing only the grime, the misery and the corruption. <br />  <br /> As Lord Roland's squire, Pagan must accompany him when the knight escorts a group of pilgrims from Jerusalem to the River Jordan and back. These were difficult times, when infidels often attacked pilgrims, and the Templar knights were needed to protect the pilgrims as they traveled through the Holy Land. No sooner are Lord Roland and Pagan back in Jerusalem when terrible news arrives. The greatest infidel of them all, Saladin, has crossed the River Jordan and taken one of the cities. It is not long before Saladin is at the very walls of Jerusalem itself, and Lord Roland finds himself leading the Templar knights and playing a large role in the future of the great city. It is at this time that Pagan learns he is capable of new emotions; he discovers that he can feel pity and care for someone else. <br />  <br /> Written from Pagan's point of view and in his own voice, complete with his sarcasm and disdain for those around him, PAGAN'S CRUSADE is an extraordinary book. We can laugh, be shocked and feel pity all at the same time. Catherine Jinks shows us, through Pagan's eyes, how harsh life was during the time of the Crusades and how distorted each side's view was of the other. It is only when they are face to face that they see and hear that they are in fact not much different from one another; we too learn that infidels and Christians were very much alike. When Jerusalem was taken from the Muslims, terrible crimes against its people were committed by the Christians. Now, in turn, Saladin's soldiers are having their revenge. Except, when they get to Jerusalem, Saladin shows the world that he can be generous. <br />  <br /> As we close this first book in a planned series of four, we wonder what Pagan and his master will do next, and are left to ponder what people have done in the name of religion. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Marya Jansen-Gruber (mjansengruber@mindspring.com) <br />	2004-07-26

In most of these tales, the moms are raising their babies by themselves because the dads are irresponsible, uninvolved, or just plain absent. Aren't there any good teenage dads out there? <br />  <br /> In THE FIRST PART LAST, the story of a teen father's growing love for his baby daughter, Angela Johnson turns the tables as she revisits a character from her award-winning novel, HEAVEN. Bobby is an ambitious young man. An aspiring artist with talented parents, he is poised to graduate early from high school. But when his girlfriend Nia surprises him on his sixteenth birthday with the news of her pregnancy, Bobby's whole world turns upside down. <br />  <br /> This brief novel alternates chapters between &quot;then&quot; and &quot;now.&quot; The &quot;then&quot; is the story of Nia's pregnancy, as Bobby and Nia struggle to decide whether to raise their child or cave to parental pressure and give her up for adoption. The &quot;now&quot; is Bobby's own struggle to do the right thing for his infant daughter Feather, as a tragedy surrounding her birth has left him to care for her alone. Bobby is lucky to have a good support system, including his mother and father, his buddies, and his caring older brother. All along, Bobby's voice, which narrates the story, wavers between great love for his daughter and panic at his situation, but the emotional heart of the story never falters. <br />  <br /> In the end, the portrayal of Bobby's relationship with his daughter is a positive one, although some critical readers might get the impression that Johnson is providing the wrong kind of role model. Not to worry. Although she does depict Bobby as a genuinely caring father, she also provides a grim picture of the not-so-rosy realities of teen parenthood, as Bobby copes with daycare dilemmas and his own insecurities: &quot;This little thing with the perfect face and hands doing nothing but counting on me. And me wanting nothing else but to run crying into my own mom's room and have her do the whole thing.&quot; <br />  <br /> If this novel has one fault, it is that Bobby seems so wrapped up in his daughter that he doesn't take time to dwell on his grief over Nia's fate. Bobby is a caring person who seemed to truly love his girlfriend (even heading halfway across Manhattan to satisfy her pregnancy cravings), so his lack of reflection on the loss of this relationship doesn't ring true. <br />  <br /> Overall, though, THE FIRST PART LAST offers an all too-rare portrayal of a caring, nurturing young man, and it should be treasured as a result. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl <br />	2004-07-26

Now Sandra has a new crowd of &quot;friends&quot;, is doing drugs, and is fooling around with boys. She is undoubtedly taking her social life to a dangerous extreme. <br />  <br /> One day, during one of her escapades, Sandra runs into (literally) a homeless alcoholic. Upset by the fact that he touched her, she and her boyfriend-of-the-moment Wayne start telling the man off. In the heat of the moment, Sandra knocks the homeless man's can of Special Brew out of his hand. Furious, the man yells at her and chases her down the road and into an alleyway.

Girl wants to be an artist, or maybe work with kids? <br />  <br /> Holland knows she's in love with Cece Goddard the minute she sees her, wearing a t-shirt that says &quot;IMRU&quot; with a small pink triangle underneath. Cece becomes Holland's biggest secret, the source of her greatest happiness as well as her biggest fear. They begin a relationship, but when word gets out that they are dating, Holland faces ostracism. Through all of Holland's troubles, Cece remains a steadfast companion, sacrificing time and energy when Holland's family turns on her. Holland knows her life will never be the same. <br />  <br /> Though the writing is smooth and Holland is a likeable, well-developed character, this is not as strong a story as, for example, Nancy Garden's ANNIE ON MY MIND. The peripheral characters are underdeveloped and somewhat stereotypical, except for Holland's friend Leah. The reactions from Holland's friends and family are painfully, undoubtedly real, but the reader ultimately begins to despair as to whether Holland will have any kind of redemption, as she seems to have no support system other than Cece. Holland turns her life in a positive direction in the end, but not without a lot of sacrifice. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Carlie Kraft <br />	2004-07-26

Paul is lucky enough to have loyal friends who are both gay and straight, along with Infinite Darlene, to help him through his confusion. However, when he needs her most, his best friend Joni enters a controlling relationship and refuses to talk to him. When Paul makes a huge dating faux pas (kissing the ex-boyfriend) and rumors begin to fly, Paul needs his friends now more than ever to help him salvage the best relationship of his life. <br /> <br />BOY MEETS BOY is the book that the teen literature world has been waiting for: it's insightful and funny, with definite guy appeal. Though it deals primarily with homosexual relationships, it shows that many teens have the same questioning thoughts on love and dating, regardless of gender. While Paul's sexuality is undoubtedly important to him, he doesn't dwell on it. The support he gets from his family, as well as his self-confidence, allows him to help his best friend Tony, whose parents do not support him after he tells them he's gay. <br /> <br />Though the main character is gay, BOY MEETS BOY is not a book aimed exclusively at gay, lesbian and bisexual teens.

First, it is the story of a girl's first three years in high school --- featuring her motley crew of friends, her feelings toward high school, and her newfound yet uncertain sexuality. On this touchy topic, Zoe basically discovers that she can't help but fall in love with everyone, whether or not they are in love with her.      Second, this is a guide to the world of book publishing and promotion. While Zoe deals with high school, she gets her book published. She also goes on weekend book tours and learns that many people like her book. This discovery unnerves Zoe and creates growing uncertainty. Readers soon find themselves wondering if this uncertainty will continue to plague Zoe for the remainder of the book.      Third, this is a story about the beginning of a girl's awkward and sometimes dark journey through life. Zoe makes some shocking confessions and twisted, yet occasionally true, observations about life. There seems to be many questions as to whether this book is indeed a true account of a person's life or a parody of an alternate universe. It is up to the reader to decide.      I found PLEASE DON'T KILL THE FRESHMAN to be weird and shocking, which made for an interesting reading experience.

Nick thinks he has left the whole street rep thing behind him two years ago, but is drawn in again to help a friend. <br /> <br />It is always disconcerting to read about Caucasians trying to talk like African-American hip-hop stars, but it illustrates one of the points of the book --- no one is who they seem.

Coburn may be trying to demonstrate that some of his characters do more than just party. New writers sometimes have a tendency to tell, not show, and that is the case here at times. Or perhaps the author is too close to the subject, as his bio explains that PREP is based on his teenage life in New York City. <br /> <br />Character problems aside, the plot is fast-paced and the descriptions of city life are vivid.

This is generally not a taxing chore, since Wentworth is only two and she can outrun him. His frequent tantrums are easily resolved by gratifying his appetite for sweets, which explains the stickiness. She likes to churn butter because it allows her to think about other things, like fairy tales. <br />  <br /> Tiffany is daydreaming on the bank of a stream one afternoon, musing on her recent decision to become a witch, while Wentworth puddles about on a nearby beach. She suddenly spies a tiny, six-inch-high blue man in a kilt with an untidy shock of red hair and a beard floating by in a bucket. He shouts, &quot;Gang awa' oot o'here, ya daft wee hinny! 'Ware the green heid!&quot; and then floats out of sight around a bend. Suddenly a strange, bubbling tide spills over the bank, containing something with long green hair and very sharp teeth. Tiffany calmly snatches Wentworth from harm's way as the tide extends watery arms to reach for the boy. Oddly, she feels anger, not fear. <br />  <br /> This causes a ripple in Discworld's magical atmosphere. Miss Tick, a witch of high power, notices and remarks, &quot;That little creature in the boat was a Nac Mac Feegle!&quot; she said. &quot;The most feared of all the fairy races! Even trolls run away from the Wee Free Men! And one of them warned her!&quot; <br />  <br /> &quot;She's the witch, then, isn't she?&quot; said a voice. Miss Tick finds this hard to believe. A nine-year-old girl with no one to teach her, in a part of Discworld never before known to hold a witch had ever... &quot;This child needs watching,&quot; she said. <br />  <br /> Thus begins the tale of Tiffany, apprentice girl witch, and her battle with the Quin (queen) of the Elves. The Quin snatches small children, enticing them with their heart's desires and keeping them locked away, forever young. When Wentworth goes missing, it naturally befalls Tiffany to strike out in search of her loathsome little brother, armed only with an iron frying pan, a book of fairy tales from her late Grandmother's house, and a piece of string. She is accompanied into fairyland by a large band of the Nac Mac Feegles who have attached themselves like fleas on a sheep to her crusade. They see her as their next kelda, or queen, and they are determined to lay down their lives to keep her safe. <br />  <br /> Terry Pratchett has devised a tale for the younger set in THE WEE FREE MEN that befits his reputation for fantastical humor. Tiffany's adventures with the Nac Mac Feegle will introduce young readers to Pratchett's strange planet of Discworld. His avid adult fans will recognize the boozing, brawling Wee Free Men from LORDS AND LADIES and CARPE JUGULARUM. We suspect that Mr. Pratchett is craftily conjuring up his own magic with children, enticing them to join his legions of fans when they grow up and become book buyers.

Twelve-year-old Penny Carson is looking forward to a long, hot summer of doing nothing more important than building a fort with her friends, a group of neighborhood boys. Her family has recently moved to the suburbs of Philadelphia, and Penny enjoys exploring the woods and the creek near her home. Little do her parents know that dangers lurk even in the idyllic suburbs. When household pets mysteriously turn up dead and fires threaten to destroy their fort, everyone blames the violence on Caleb Devlin, a no-good older teen who is back in town after a stint in juvenile detention following some unnamed violent crimes he committed years ago. Gradually, though, Penny begins to suspect that Caleb is not the one responsible for this new wave of terror. <br />  <br /> Penny is at a difficult age. She's not sure if she wants to kiss the boys or play flashlight tag with them. She hates the bra her mom buys for her, but she is also embarrassed by the childish sundress she is forced to wear. For some inexplicable reason, she remains drawn to her neighbor Amy, an older girl who recently hit puberty and immediately became verbally abusive to Penny and her friends. As Penny investigates the grisly threats in her neighborhood, she also explores her own conflicted feelings about growing up. <br />  <br /> THE CREEK contains some scenes of gruesome violence. These graphic situations, including threats of rape, seem to aim the book at older readers. Penny and her friends, however, are preteens and, in many ways, seem even younger than they really are, as they play tag together and become really excited when they get to go to the local ice cream parlor. Older readers may be turned off by Penny's childishness in many scenes, and younger readers may be truly frightened by the creepy &quot;calling cards&quot; left by the killer. If THE CREEK finds an appropriate audience, however, persistent readers with strong stomachs will enjoy unraveling the grisly clues. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl <br />	2004-07-26

When I finished the last page of Mitch Albom's TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE, I knew I had to share the book with as many people as I could. I proceeded to buy 41 copies, inscribe them all to my friends and family members, hand them out, mail them --- whatever I had to do to spread the word. The book was that moving, in my opinion. So I was eagerly looking forward to THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN and I am happy to report that Albom did not disappoint me. He is a first-rate storyteller, and THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN is an imaginative, creative tale in the tradition of the best fairy tales or folklore. <br />  <br /> Eddie is a maintenance man who keeps the rides safe at the Ruby Pier amusement park. His 83rd birthday seems like any other day --- he inspects the rides, watches the people, makes pipe cleaner animals for the children. However on this day he dies unexpectedly, trying to rescue a young girl in harm's way. <br />  <br /> Eddie wakes up in heaven --- but not to the &quot;paradise garden, a place where (we) can float on clouds and laze in rivers and mountains,&quot; not the idyllic place that heaven has been described as throughout time. Eddie awakens to a series of introductions --- or reintroductions --- to five people whom he had met during his life, either in passing or at length. They each carry answers to the whys and hows of Eddie's life. With each meeting he relives in part that time of his life, but now the gaps are filled in. For maybe the first time he sees what REALLY happened. &quot;There are five people you meet in heaven,&quot; the Blue Man, Eddie's first encounter, explains. &quot;Each of us was in your life for a reason. You may not have known the reason at the time, and that is what heaven is for. For understanding your life on earth.&quot; <br />  <br /> All five are of course deceased, and they all impart knowledge of Eddie's life and life in general. For instance, the Blue Man asks, &quot;Why do people gather when others die,&quot;and his explanation is at the very core of the meaning of Albom's book: &quot;It is because the human spirit knows, deep down, that all lives intersect. That death doesn't just take someone, it misses someone else, and in the small distance between being taken and being missed lives are changed.&quot; It is insights like these that leave the reader asking, &quot;What does Mitch Albom know that we don't?&quot; <br />  <br /> What he knows is that we all seek answers. We look for meaning behind the experiences in our lives. More often than not, we never get the answers but we continue --- we plod on, happy or unhappy, fulfilled or unfulfilled, pain-free or in pain. We live. Albom doesn't pretend to offer us the answers, but he does offer us an almost Taoist interpretation of life. It is. It just is. The answers may never be revealed. And do they need to be? <br />  <br /> THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN is a beautiful story. Eddie is human and likable for his foibles, fears and faults. The writing is often lyrical and fable-like. And though the book is fiction, behind it lies Albom's lifelong love of his uncle, which lends a tenderness and intimacy to the tale on par with TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE. You'll want to share this with your friends, family, acquaintances, and even those nameless people you pass on the street who may have played a larger role in your life than you ever could have imagined. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Roberta O'Hara <br />	2004-07-26

One of my most vivid memories of junior high is of a banner-length sign over the chalkboard of the room where I had English. It read: &quot;Nothing is as constant as change.&quot; Like someone in junior high needed to be told that. The problem was: No one ever told us how to deal with change. Were we supposed to fight it? Accept that we couldn't do anything about it? If you can get past the incredibly, um, cheesy premise of the latest incarnation of the popular yet controversial WHO MOVED MY CHEESE books, there might be a few answers in store for you. Maybe. <br />  <br /> The book uses a metaphor of mice, cheese and a maze to try to help its readers realize that life's changes are inevitable and, in order to get what we desire most (the cheese), we have to be unafraid to change and make choices that will get us closer to the &quot;cheese.&quot; Unfortunately, the book wavers between making the metaphor too hazy and beating the reader over the head with it. The opening conversation between the human characters is contrived and unrealistic, a deterrent to reading the story itself. The human characters act, at the end of the story, as though they've been through some life-altering experience. Even though the message is important, the reader can't help but laugh at the &quot;Full House&quot; styled ending.

Thousands of phone calls, miles and dollars later, they put all of the interviews and their experiences together in a fascinating and often hilarious account of their talks with people from all walks of life. <br />  <br /> Many of the successful people they interviewed were discouraged from pursuing their interests as children.

In the summer of 2000, a group of Israeli and Palestinian teenagers were invited to Switzerland. Despite many misunderstandings between the Jews and Muslims on the trip, tentative friendships were formed. However, just before the students returned home to Israel, the second Intifada broke out reminding each participant of their differences. Two young women on the trip who did become friends were Palestinian Amal Rifa'i and Israeli Odelia Ainbinder. Two years later, in June of 2002, journalist Sylke Tempel began looking for a young Israeli and a young Palestinian to exchange letters and ideas in order to create a book that would tell the story of Palestine, Israel and the Intifada in their own words. She found the ideal pair in Amal and Odelia. The result is WE JUST WANT TO LIVE HERE, a series of letters and conversations between Amal and Odelia. <br /> <br />Just 18 years old when they begin corresponding, the women are wise beyond their years and patient with each other's points of view. There is much potential for name-calling, disrespect and worse in such a dialogue, but Amal and Odelia behave with a restraint and open-mindedness often sorely lacking in regards to this difficult and delicate subject. Covering topics such as Jerusalem (where they both live, geographically close but socio-cultural worlds apart), school and the Israeli army, both women are not only quite honest and articulate about their feelings, but are also well versed in their cultural and religious history and tradition. To further illustrate certain points, each invites family members to share her story and thus we read about Odelia's parents and Amal's grandfather in their own words. <br /> <br />Even with such an open dialogue, Amal and Odelia realize there are some things they may never see eye to eye on --- each has a different interpretation of the formation history of the State of Israel, each interprets the plight of the Palestinians in a very different way. Yet they both agree that continued violence is not the answer and hope for strong leadership for the Israelis and the Palestinians. One major problem they both identify is the lack of knowledge about each other's culture, religion and history. Knowledge, they stress, is key to a sustainable peace. <br /> <br />As the book was being written, both Amal and Odelia faced adult life and responsibility --- Amal was engaged to be married and Odelia was preparing for her mandatory service in the Israeli army. Yet the tone of the book still reflected a youthful hopefulness and youthful frustration. <br /> <br />Poignant, brutally honest and sometimes heartbreaking, WE JUST WANT TO LIVE HERE is written with the idealism of youth and the cynicism of those who grow up amid war and violence. This is a book that puts a human face on the violence and destruction of the Israeli-Palestinian war and invites the reader to question her beliefs and opinions. Amal and Odelia are brave and admirable, willing to open their hearts and minds to each other. <br /> <br />WE JUST WANT TO LIVE HERE is not about solutions or roadmaps to peace. It is the tale of a friendship and intellectual exchange in spite of the most difficult circumstances imaginable. I highly recommend this book for those who want a glimpse of what life is like for teenagers in Israel. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Sarah Rachel Egelman <br />	2004-07-26

Fourteen-year-old Joelle, who is adopted and lives in Marshfield, Rhode Island, doesn't know much about her past. All she is aware of is that she was brought in from a train station when she was just five years old. &quot;I can't remember anything so don't ask me!&quot; she yells irritably to anyone who snoops, including Carlos, an eccentric kid in her Spanish class. But when Carlos, a collector of arrowheads and Native American lore, tells her that she resembles an Indian girl in an old mural of Narragansett Indians in their school library, she can't resist taking a look. She is dumbfounded by a spark of recognition. <br />  <br /> When Joelle asks her adoptive parents, Uncle Vernon and Aunt Mary Louise, about her past, they tell her what happened but she doesn't believe them. Then, while on a hike, Carlos tells her about the Crying Rocks, where howls on windy days are thought to be the spirit voices of children who were flung from the boulders to an early death. Joelle doesn't believe that story either until one day, while at the Crying Rocks with Carlos, she hears crying and screaming. After her Aunt Mary Louise dies, she grows more and more curious about her past, not to mention the cries and screams. Will Joelle ever discover the truth behind the Crying Rocks and her past? Or will both stories be a secret forever? <br />  <br /> THE CRYING ROCKS had an incredible ending, and I agree wholeheartedly with Joelle's attempts to learn the details of her past.

In her latest novel, WASTELAND, Francesca Lia Block forces readers outside their comfort zones and into a story in which the love between a brother and sister provides both great joy and incredible anguish. <br />  <br /> Lex and Marina have always been close. One of Lex's earliest memories was of his sister as a baby: &quot;Then you reached out and curled your fingers around me, so tight, I knew you recognized me. That was the first time I knew I had a heart inside my body.&quot; The siblings' connections only grow deeper as they get older; Lex is obsessively protective of his baby sister, and Marina finds herself dressing and acting like Lex to ensure his acceptance of her. As they enter adolescence, both siblings become intensely aware of each other's bodies, until their attraction to each other comes to a crossroads one night. <br />  <br /> As a result of their encounter, Lex betrays Marina and then commits suicide. Marina is torn apart by her own grief and her unanswered questions about her brother's death. She turns to Lex's friend West, who is willing to stand back while Marina searches for answers and wait for her to be able to love again. <br />  <br /> It probably won't surprise anyone that this book is for mature teen audiences. Readers should be emotionally ready to deal with WASTELAND's complex subject matter. In addition, the rapidly switching narrators and points of view (including some chapters written from the perspective of the dead brother) require a sophisticated reader, as does the extended passage from T. S. Eliot's poem that inspired the novel's title. <br />  <br /> One of the book's major weaknesses is the surprise ending, which is probably meant to provide dramatic irony but instead feels tacked on and unnecessary. Readers who are ready to grapple with Block's lyrical prose and challenging topic will be rewarded by an emotionally rich novel about a compellingand thought-provoking relationship. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl <br />	2004-07-26

And she knows it's a lie. <br /> <br />It started with Hayley Parkin, who befriended Anna when Anna moved to Melanie's school. Everyone loved Hayley but they were also afraid of her. Hayley was the sort who would be your friend one minute and make fun of your clothes the next. Of course no one told Anna that. So when her best friend suddenly starts ignoring her, spreading rumors about her and turning their classmates against her, Anna can't figure out where she went wrong. She tries to appease Hayley, but nothing seems to work. The only one who's skeptical of Hayley's actions is Melanie, who's been burned before by Hayley's slick form of cruelty. Melanie is caught in a bad place: she wants to be liked, which means staying on Hayley's good side, but she also knows exactly what Hayley does to people. No one has all the answers, until Anna attempts something drastic. In a series of letters and memories, we see Anna's true self: strong and resilient on the outside but a total wreck inside. <br /> <br />Think you know your friends? Think again. You know Anna, Melanie and Hayley, and you hate what they do. The author never lets you forget how real the characters are. Despite this, much of the book is melodramatic, emotionally flat and unfulfilling. The reader sees too much pain, too many malicious actions and soon becomes desensitized to it.

In an industry that probably presses out a book (or two) a minute, so-called &quot;new voices&quot; are a dime a dozen. New voices with original, well-written stories are not nearly as abundant. And that's why STONE GARDEN by Molly Moynahan is such a literary treat. Moynahan is a new voice that knows how to tell a story. <br />  <br /> STONE GARDEN is the poignant tale of not just the untimely death of a life only begun, but also the unsettling effect that death has on the fragile life left behind. At book's start, 17-year-old Matthew Swan is dead. Alice, his best friend for over a decade and once-believed future partner, is left behind to mourn, grieve and adjust to the loss. She seeks mindless, disconnected connections in a few physical encounters that leave her, and this reader, asking the unanswerable question of what it would have been like with Matthew, her silenced soul mate, her dead destiny. She seeks solace in conversations and interactions with her parents, her teachers, her friends, and even the inmates at Rahway prison, where she is teaching writing as a school project. But she doesn't find release and her pain of separation is as palpable as Romeo and Juliet's collective pain. Excuse the comparison to that most famous of first-love couples, but it was unavoidable --- it's there on every page of Moynahan's doomed romance. <br />  <br /> STONE GARDEN is ripe with surprisingly true teenage dialogue that straddles the worlds of inquisitive childhood and knowing adulthood, stepping back and forth between the two as only adolescents finding maturity and reluctantly shedding innocence can, and as only a very good writer can capture. Screaming she's &quot;not a baby anymore,&quot; Alice mounts her pink three-speed Schwinn decorated with pink plastic streamers and takes off down the road to face solo her demons of lost love. &quot;...Matthew Swan had held my face in his hands and told me that he loved me with every part of himself, that he had loved me from themoment he saw me trip over my shoe laces, and while it had taken a while for us to grow up and get it right, we would get it so right that never in the history of love affairs and marriages and big families with beautiful children and grandchildren would anyone get it more right,&quot; she reflected with the nave idealism of a young person struggling with love and death for the first time. <br />  <br /> Moynahan knows teenagers, their desires and their hauntings --- and she delivers them in STONE GARDEN. But more importantly, she knows people. STONE GARDEN is more that just Alice's story. A strong cast of well-drawn characters lends even more realism to the story. Matthew's mother and siblings for that matter are 'alternative' in their thinking and appearance; their scenes are hippy-dippy, artsy-fartsy, and would be laughable if not so sad in their efforts to deal with Matthew's demise. Alice's younger brother, Alf, designs clothes for fun. A teacher by trade, Moynahan's book could even be called a valentine to educators; a particularly appealing character is the able teacher Alice and Matthew had befriended, whom Alice calls on in her times of need. <br />  <br /> The universal issues of death, love and growing up have always been fodder for good books. But few, in my opinion, have crafted the combination so masterfully as Molly Moynahan in STONE GARDEN. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Roberta O'Hara, who is the Events Coordinator at the Princeton U-Store. <br />	2004-07-26

The essence of THE WEDDING, Nicholas Sparks's latest novel of self-discovery and self-redemption, is that a man can consciously effect change in himself. THE WEDDING is the story of attorney Wilson Lewis, the son-in-law of Noah and Allie Calhoun, the well-remembered couple made famous in Sparks's debut novel THE NOTEBOOK. Throughout THE WEDDING, Sparks refers to the relationship that endears his readers to the Calhouns. Wilson questions his own ability to romance his wife Jane when he completely forgets their twenty-ninth anniversary. For the next year, he plans an occasion she will never forget. <br />  <br /> When Wilson and Jane's daughter Anna comes home with the news that she is to marry, Wilson finds the vehicle to effect his own plans for a renewal of the lost emotion in his own marriage. Anna requests a simple, quick wedding, but Jane rejects this. A compromise is reached to have the ceremony the following weekend, but it will not be the &quot;go-to-the-courthouse, justice-of-the-peace&quot; type ceremony that Anna had first outlined. With her husband's assistance, Jane helps Anna carry out plans for a small family-and-friends celebration. <br />  <br /> Sparks effectively uses flashback techniques to keep the story line moving toward Anna's wedding day, the climax of the weeklong activities. Throughout, Wilson remembers his first date, first kiss, courtship, wedding and marriage with Jane. The realization that their relationship has changed, and not for the better, gives him the impetus to make changes in himself. Anna's wedding is the catalyst for effecting that transformation. <br />  <br /> Wilson's close friendship with Noah, now widowed, is the undercurrent for the emotion he needs to move forward in his plans for a better marriage. Noah is a gentleman, now living in a retirement center. His and Allie's home remains in the family but is uninhabited. Noah spends his time at Creekside with food outstretched to a white swan that glides across the pool forhis daily attention. The act gives him purpose, after Alzheimer's disease has taken Allie from him. Wilson is the recipient of his wisdom in the unfolding story. <br />  <br /> Wilson becomes involved in Anna's wedding plans when he suggests that Noah's house be the chosen site. He arranges for the renovation and restoration of the interior as well as the rose garden, accomplished in a short week. He romances Jane as well during this time, becoming the family &quot;chef&quot; when her days are filled with shopping. <br />  <br /> One wonders how Wilson can attend to his own business during the frenetic days following Anna's wedding announcement. But THE WEDDING is a story of renewed efforts to make a man's personal life better. Sparks has the ability to tell a simple story with rich emotion and give his readers a sense of fulfillment. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Judy Gigstad <br />	2004-07-26

To complicate matters, her mother is pregnant at 47, her ex-boyfriend is dating a girl with really big breasts, and her stepbrother's friend Miles is interested in her when she so doesn't have time for a boyfriend...or does she? And don't forget about Dan, the poet, or his filmmaker girlfriend Vanessa, or his sister Jenny, who is dating Blair's ex-boyfriend Nate. It promises to be a wild Christmas for everyone. <br /> <br />The third Gossip Girl book lacks the sparkle of its predecessors as characterizations fall flat, the writing feels rushed, and many consistency errors appear. Gossip Girl's omniscient voice is boring rather than snarky. Name-dropping of brands becomes more important than the story, as though this were a Neiman Marcus catalog rather than a novel.

She also knows that her parents do not get along and that sometimes violence erupts. When her mother moves into a cabin she owns and only visits a few days a week, Franky thinks they just need their own space for a little while. But things seem to get worse and her father's behavior becomes more extreme. <br /> <br />Franky's alter ego, Freaky Green Eyes, is a tough personality that saves her from dangerous and scary situations and is now needed more and more often at home. When her mother disappears, Franky does not want to know what happened. But the truth always seems to have a way of getting out. <br /> <br />Fans of Joyce Carol Oates's marvelous BIG MOUTH & UGLY GIRL most likely will be disappointed with this effort. It's fairly obvious early on in the book what's going to happen and who will be to blame for it. While Franky's denial of her terrible home life is realistic, it goes on for far too long for the patience of readers. <br /> <br />I believe the symbolism of the Freaky Green Eyes is too heavy-handed for savvy teen readers. The book starts by explaining the name in a scene that is strongly reminiscent of Laurie Halse Anderson's SPEAK. But the near-rape scene does not quite fit in with the domestic violence in Franky's home, making the nickname somewhat confusing. <br /> <br />Oates has always been a master of voice, and readers will understand Franky even if they are exasperated with her delayed ability to see the signs of what's coming. Her strong characterization is not enough, however, to overcome the stereotyped parents and predictable plot. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Amy Alessio	2004-07-26

Caitlin's summer life on the island promises to be a game of avoiding the town's scummy college-age self-proclaimed gift to women and trying to figure out what to do about her best friend, who is hanging out with people Caitlin finds unsavory. <br />  <br /> The moment she sees Lucas, though, she knows things will be different.

That's the question Sharon Draper explores in her new novel, THE BATTLE OF JERICHO. <br />  <br /> Jericho seems to have it all together --- he has a tight group of friends, he does OK at school, and he loves playing the trumpet. In fact, his music teacher is talking about Juilliard if he does well at his upcoming music contest. But Jericho is insecure, too --- he's carrying around a few extra pounds, and he sure would like to have a girlfriend. So when he, his cousin Josh, and his best friend are invited to pledge the Warriors of Distinction, Jericho should be thrilled, especially when a fine girl like Arielle starts showing interest in him because of his soon-to-be Warrior status. All the adults seem to think the Warriors, with their community service projects and commanding presence at school, are just great. Jericho's uncle, a former Warrior himself, is so proud of Jericho and Josh. So why does Jericho get an uneasy feeling about the club? <br />  <br /> Readers will start feeling uncomfortable, too, when they read about the club's intense hazing rituals. Bound by a code of secrecy, the pledges are forced into disgusting, demeaning, and dangerous situations.

The book flip-flops between the two points of view, making them seem even further apart. Author Robert Corbet has a great male character in Will --- believable, vulnerable, human. But Mia is less likable. She does not seem like a three-dimensional girl with deep feelings. For example, Mia learns that her father is unfaithful.

Any mention of witches and/or witchcraft, and most teenagers will zero in to see what it's all about. This new and carefully researched book on the Salem witch trails will disappoint neither teens nor adults. Marc Aronson has laid out his material in an easy-to-follow format, dividing the chapters by timeline.<br />Before the introductory pages, \\"Note to the Reader\\" explains that research still does not give us a final answer surrounding the events in 1692 Salem. Aronson asks the reader, aiming his narrative at a teen audience, to think about what might have made the accusers act as they did. After all, he points out, \\"Many of the accusers were teenagers.\\" He also notes some of the discrepancies, such as the fact that the slave known as Tituba was not black but more likely an Indian. His purpose here is to show that the smallest matters can be crucial in uncovering truth, especially since so much fantasy has surrounded the Salem witch trials.<br />THE CRUCIBLE by Arthur Miller is examined, as the author spends time building the case of Miller's brilliant fiction against what really lay behind the compelling Salem events. Frequently, Aronson makes flattering reference to Miller and to the many writers who laid the groundwork for his own research. And while he used transcripts of the pretrial hearings, for better understanding, punctuation and spellings were changed.<br />An index plus notes for cross-referencing make this an excellent reference book. The narrative style is smooth, and teens will find both the subject and writing appealing. Beyond the practical aspects of this work, Aronson has created a fantastic book that illustrates the agony of all the people --- accusers, victims, judges and families --- who were involved in the witch-hunts.

Raised in colonial India, sixteen-year-old Gemma Doyle wants nothing more than to leave the hot, sticky atmosphere for the civilized world of England, with its temperate climate, good education and bustling social scene. To her surprise, Gemma gets her wish in a dramatic and tragic way, when her mother is killed in a mysterious, supernatural attack and her father, unable to cope with his grief, becomes addicted to opium.<br />Gemma is now enrolled at the Spence Academy, an exclusive finishing school for young ladies. The high-spirited, free-thinking Gemma constantly finds herself in conflict not only with the school's rules and regulations but with the highly structured Victorian society of which the school is a part. Gemma is also unable to fit into the social atmosphere of the school itself --- the other students are catty and snobbish, unwilling to accept this new student with her unknown pedigree and unconventional ideas.<br />That is, until Gemma finds a diary, written twenty years before, that sheds light on Spence's history and her own prophetic visions. She discovers her ability to travel to the realms, a dream world where every girl's most passionate fantasy can come true. Joining her are three friends, secretly united by their midnight travels to this otherworldly realm. As the close-knit group becomes more daring and more caught up in the magic, they find themselves repeating the events that led to tragedy twenty years before.<br />It's probably inaccurate to call A GREAT AND TERRIBLE BEAUTY a work of historical fiction. Although the setting is Victorian England, the characters, especially Gemma, are anything but Victorian. Instead, Gemma, with her frankness about sex, her astute and ironic commentaries about her social situation, and her desire for independence, seems like a twenty-first century girl dropped into 1895. That's not a problem, though, as long as readers don't expect historical and cultural accuracy from the novel.<br />Infact, the author has a lot of fun with the conventions of traditional boarding school novels, including such stock figures as the free-thinking teacher, the spiritualist and the mysterious gypsy woman. Those who are familiar with Victorian novels from Dickens to Bronte will probably greatly enjoy Libba Bray's send-up of typical characters and themes.<br />The supernatural elements of the book, though, are what set it apart from other novels of its type. The mythology of the realms and the magical Order to which Gemma and her mother belong are not fully developed in the novel. Neither does the story come to a satisfactory conclusion, as Gemma has yet to realize the full extent of her prophetic powers. Rumor has it, though, that A GREAT AND TERRIBLE BEAUTY is but the first in a trilogy, and one hopes that these elements will be explored in more depth in the book's sequels.<br />   --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl	2004-06-16

Her question is prompted partly by her recent visit to a concentration camp in France --- an experience that troubles her more than she ever expected. During the trip, Hilly's sister Zoe points out that their grandmother was German and that she makes frequent racist comments. Zoe even goes so far as to offhandedly call HeidiGran a Nazi, a charge her family instantly and thoroughly denies.<br />Hilly and Zoe argue constantly as they prepare for their grandmother to move in with their family. HeidiGran, suffering from Alzheimer's disease, experiences confused periods interposed with more lucid ones. She can no longer distinguish which of her memories are secrets that she's guarded from everyone her entire life. The truth is at odds with what her family has always believed. One by one, she begins to share enticing bits of these dangerous revelations with her shocked granddaughters. However, when questioned further, HeidiGran retreats into confusion.<br />Hilly feels compelled to uncover the truth about her grandmother's past before HeidiGran's memory is entirely erased by her disease. In the meantime, she worries about and is angered by Zoe's new friends, one of whom wears a swastika. Did Zoe's friends attack Hilly's Palestinian friend, injured in a racist attack? Hilly's concerns about racism are even closer to her heart as she begins to fall in love for the first time with her friend's brother.<br />Along the way, SISTERLAND tells the story of HeidiGran's childhood through flashbacks interwoven into Hilly's story. While the reader is soon clued in on HeidiGran's heartbreaking secret, there's a whopper of a surprise yet in store before the tale is done.<br />This is a long book, but the pace never lags. I found myself completely absorbed by Hilly's search for, and her family's transformation by, HeidiGran's truth. I highly recommend SISTERLAND for anyone who enjoys an amazingly good read crammed full of family relationships, romance, history, mystery and sympathetic characters.<br />   --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon (...)	2004-05-18

GIRLS ON FILM is another light and glamorous read about the lives of rich and beautiful teens. If this series were on TV, it would be on the WB.<br />GIRLS ON FILM continues the story of Anna Percy, a New York transplant in Beverly Hills. Anna is still trying to avoid Ben and his lies, but now she has bigger problems when her sister Susan leaves rehab and comes to L.A. The other girls in school who were rejected by Ben also continue to try and make her life miserable.<br />Nice guy Adam has possibilities, but he can't make her forget Ben. A new internship is harder than she thought, and a family emergency may cut that opportunity short.<br />THE A-LIST plot loses some steam in this book. Readers will cringe at Anna's choices and possibly at the surprising ending. While she was determined to stand on her own feet in L.A. during THE A-LIST, here she is bogged down with guy concerns. Cammie is a bit of a revenging female catty stereotype here, and Anna's tentative new friendship with Sam seems untrustworthy as well.<br />The setting and family issues keep this one above water, though, as readers will fantasize about having refreshments at the Beverly Hills Hotel and making movies for school assignments at a posh spa. Anna's new interest in writing should give her refreshing new goals and plots in future books, too.

Matty, Village's message carrier, lives with Seer, the blind man who took him in when Matty arrived in the town.<br />As his story begins, there is something Matty must do, although he fears it: he makes his way through Forest. Most of the other villagers won't venture into the increasingly dangerous woods because people, strangled by vines and branches, have died there. Forest welcomes Matty, however, and he has memorized the mazelike paths. This evening's mysterious quest leads to a certain frog. We learn that Matty discovered he has extraordinary powers when he healed this frog and brought him back from the brink of certain death. This potential force, with its implied responsibilities, terrifies Matty.<br />There are mysterious happenings in Matty's once-perfect Village. The family of Matty's friend Ramon recently traded for a Gaming Machine, a toy that rewards players with candy. Matty yearns for one of his own but worries about Ramon, who grows increasingly ill. A group, led by Matty's teacher, Mentor, has begun to protest Village's traditional open door to immigrants. This troubles Matty; it is so unlike the caring Mentor he has always admired. In fact, his teacher appears subtly different each time Matty sees him: Mentor is taller, thinner, and both his bald spot and his birthmark are disappearing.<br />Are the ominous changes in town related to the Trade Mart? What are people really trading? When Matty attends, everyone's hands are empty. Although they're making deals with the Trade Master, they bring nothing and carry nothing away. Some in the crowd weep; others argue. Most, though, are silent and nervous.<br />Matty promises Seer that he will travel through Forest to the village on the other side in order to bring Seer's daughter, Kira, to him. The clock is ticking because the villagers plan to build a fence by a certain date, admitting no newcomers. Matty believes they have time --- until Forest attacks the travelers. The trip toward Village becomes a nightmare journey, complete with flesh-tearing roots and twigs, blistering sap, unbearable stench and strangling vines.<br />Lois Lowry's many fans will love this fantasy, which continues the stories of several characters previously encountered in THE GIVER and GATHERING BLUE.

They each need the scholarship for college in the fall and grapple with certain issues.<br />Mandy was just getting ready to take things with her long-term boyfriend to the next level. Kai may or may not belong in the V Club (she's not saying), but why does the presence of ex-boyfriend Andres cause her such pain?

Brugman accurately and horrifically portrays the high school scene and the peer pressure that is faced while in high school.<br />The protagonist, Megan Tuw, has always been part of the in-crowd. This popularity gives Megan a sense of security and sometimes gets her into trouble, as is the case when she is kicked out of a class for talking. Megan's attitude earns her detention, where she spends time with \\"the freak\\" of the high school, Perdita. Megan realizes, through the writing assignments that they are required to do while in detention, that Perdita is an intelligent and complex person. She begins to spend time with Perdita, keeping these outings a secret from her friends. Megan knows that the in-crowd would ruin her status as a popular figure if they knew that she was becoming friends with \\"the freak.\\"<br />At some point within the novel, Megan is faced with a difficult choice: Perdita or her popular crowd. Brugman realistically portrays the turmoil that Megan goes through --- her fears of losing popularity and hurting her friends, her jealousy of being replaced, her feelings of inferiority when spending time with the more intelligent and knowledgeable Perdita, and struggling to figure out how to be true to herself.<br />Readers of WALKING NAKED will be able to relate to the pressures of being popular and of needing to have the right clothes, the right friends and the right looks.

Elsie V. Aidinoff's Eden will be recognizable to those who have read it in Genesis or heard the story retold elsewhere, but she adds some completely original twists. Adam and Eve are raised separately: Adam by a controlling, jealous and angry God who insists on total obedience, and Eve by the wise and gentle Serpent, who encourages her to ask questions and challenges her to think for herself.<br />It is no surprise that such drastically different characters come into conflict. Eve cannot understand a god who refuses to accept her questioning. Adam does not know how to disobey God who, in Aidinoff's Eden, is not always looking after the best interests of his creations. A quarter of the way into the book, this conflict leads to rape. The rest of the story deals with Eve's recovery from the violation, and how she comes to make her decision to eat from the Tree of Knowledge, a choice that Aidinoff equates with freeing humans from the hands of an angry god.<br />Aidinoff's ideas are compelling and poetic, but even in the hands of a clearly gifted writer there are unavoidable conflicts in the narrative. One of the largest narrative problems is the rape itself and the necessity for Eve to forgive her attacker who, after all, is the only man in all of creation.<br />Still, this book explores a number of interesting ideas and is an excellent place to begin asking many of the difficult questions that are a part of human existence: the problem of evil, science vs. mythology, the hierarchy of living beings and, ultimately, freewill. It is beautifully and lovingly written. The characters of Eve and the Serpent are especially well-realized. The Serpent is not equated with Evil or Satan, but with Justice and Wisdom. When Eve asks him who he is, the Serpent replies, \\"My role on this earth: to counterbalance the excesses of a jealous god.\\"<br />One of the most interesting questions that THE GARDEN asks is how much Adam and Eve knew before they ate from the Tree of Knowledge. In this story, Eve has learned a great deal about the nature of good vs. evil, not to mention suffering and the soul, before she makes her choice. As part of her healing process, Eve and the Serpent travel outside the garden to see the rest of the world. Even before she has eaten from the Tree of Knowledge, Eve experiences the desert, the mountains, the ocean and the volcano, and learns the skills she will need to survive outside the garden.<br />Ultimately, Aidinoff's novel makes a powerful case for Eve's choice and for the idea that the introduction of knowledge, and the death that comes with it, is necessary for human development. \\"If there were no death,\\" the Serpent tells Eve, \\"most beings would be very old. The ancient would rule, for they would have power. And they would believe they know best ... The Earth would be quickly overrun. You could not have a succession of beings progressing through life, each generation learning and growing and giving in its own way, rediscovering beauty, taking joy in the world around them. Death makes way for the young.\\"<br />This is a powerful message for readers, some of whom will be experiencing these questions for the first time. THE GARDEN is an excellent place to begin their journey, and would also be a good choice for an intergenerational book club. There is likely to be controversy about Aidinoff's version of the Judeo-Christian creation myth, but this also makes for good discussion and reading.<br />   --- Reviewed by Sarah A. Wood	2004-05-17

When Lily begs her mother to accompany her to the New World to find her father, her mother reluctantly agrees.<br />The voyage is miserably cramped and filthy. A live pig lives in the room where the poor passengers eat their meals of watery soup and insect-ridden black bread. Lily meets the baron's son, Ethan, onboard and inadvertently blurts that Frere Lanther lives with them. When Lily's mother is raped, Lily is heartsick. She knows her mother's punishment was a direct result of Lily's exposing her family's secret.<br />A shipwreck upon the shores of the New World ends the voyage. The castaways stumble upon a gruesome discovery, which increases Lily's fear that her father is dead. When her mother is kidnapped, Lily must set off alone through the forest, starving and terrified. What she finds in the forest is astonishing.<br />Multilayered REDEMPTION is truly unique. Lily's story is a harrowing physical and spiritual quest laden with mystery, filled with unexpected plot twists. The tale is harsh, violent and gruesome --- not for anyone wanting to view history through a rosy haze. Yet the book is also vibrant, riveting and beautifully written. Lily herself is a believable, sympathetic character surviving devastation after devastation.<br />If you love history, you'll enjoy this powerful piece of historical fiction. If you snoozed through history class (as I did), you'll love REDEMPTION for a fascinating read that may even turn you --- yes, YOU! --- into a history buff.<br />   --- (...)	2004-05-17

They come in all shapes, sizes and colors, and are found amid railroad tracks and gravestones in New Jersey --- the land of French fries with gravy, abandoned boardwalks and petrochemical refineries. Here, they plan the Tithe, the sacrifice of a \\"beautiful, talented mortal\\" they must make once every seven years in order to keep the world more or less in order.<br />Kaye Fierch has come back to her home in New Jersey after years of traveling around the country with her rock musician mother. For years she has known that faeries, like her childhood friends Spike and Lutie, are real, though no one else believes her. When Kaye learns that there's a little more to her relations with faeries than just a willingness to believe, she finds herself at the center of a faerie power struggle. All the elements of a proper faerie tale are here, from the battle between good and evil to the knight in shining trench coat. Blended with an urban setting the reader can smell, hear and taste, they form a sexy, scary story.<br />This is fantasy for readers who hate the fantasy worlds of wizards and dragons, and romance for those who don't want their romance sappy and covered in flowers and chocolate. Though some of the descriptions are overwrought, TITHE is still a captivating, fast-paced tale of self-discovery with as much charm as the faeries themselves.<br />   (...)	2004-05-17
US	18548250	R3GL3PFEWY2VWU	0385730314	543575763	1: Rush Hour: Sin	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A powerful collection that pushes the envelope	Young adult fiction has developed beyond the issue- or relationship-driven novels with which it has long been associated. Today, YA fiction reflects the complexity and ambiguity of the contemporary teen experience. Young adult literature has been waiting a long time for a literary journal to legitimize the genre. RUSH HOUR, a twice yearly \\"journal of contemporary voices,\\" has the potential to do just that.<br />The theme of RUSH HOUR's first issue is Sin. Editor Michael Cart has assembled a collection of morally complex pieces under this issue's theme of Sin. Included in the collection are stories, poems and essays by a variety of better and lesser known YA authors, including Brock Cole, Joan Bauer and Emma Donoghue. These pieces cover a variety of material: shoplifting, corporate ethics, social equality, sportsmanship, sexuality and war.<br />The most striking and potentially controversial story in the collection is \\"The Silk Ball\\" by Terry Davis, which weaves Hmong folklore into a story about the United States' secret war in Laos during the Vietnam period. Graphic violence and sexuality punctuate a story filled with poetic vision, longing and loss. Adults may be hesitant to let their young ones read this material, never mind the fact that the characters in the story --- and the age of actual soldiers in military conflicts then and now --- are closer to the age of the intended readers than the adults who would want to shield impressionable young minds from such material.<br />Another marvelous piece in this issue is a nonfiction essay by Hazel Rochman, \\"What Would I Have Done?\\" The essay is illustrated with a pen and ink drawing by Mark Podwal of a fragmented Star of David, complete with the now familiar iconography of railroad tracks, smokestacks and tattooed limbs. I expected a straightforward essay about the Holocaust, but was surprised to find something much more complex. Rochman uses the Holocaust, which she assumes most readers are familiar with, to discuss the systemic and structural oppression of other people in the world today. She discusses her experiences living in South Africa during apartheid, including a marvelous anecdote about hiding Nelson Mandela in her home by pretending he was the gardener. She challenges the reader to think about their role in a world that continues to profit off the oppression of others. Like Marc Aronson's essay, \\"The Sins of Salem,\\" about the role of youth in the Salem Witch Trials, also in this issue, Rochman's piece is relevant to young people and recognizes their involvement in making history as well as influencing the events of the present.<br />The marvelous thing about poetry is the sense of immediacy it can bring to events or emotions. RUSH HOUR also includes several powerful poems dealing with contemporary lives. \\"Massage\\" by Sonya Sones is about adolescent longing and captures perfectly the inner monologue that accompanies burgeoning sexuality, including the frustration of thwarted desire. \\"Later On / My hands / touch / my untouched places, / imagining / how his hands might have felt / on my skin, / trying to feel / how my skin might have felt / to his hands,\\" Sones writes.<br />Elizabeth Lord-Rollins offers a glimpse into the lives of inner-city youth with her poem \\"The Terror Class.\\" It is in five parts, utilizing different points of view, condensing a series of images and evocative emotions, fusing complex subjects like poverty, education, drug use and race relations. \\"Does my bebop scare you? / Walking with my buddies / Can I make you cross to the other side / Hey, white bread / Do you resent bein' terrorized / On streets we both know / Belong to you?\\" she writes.<br />The inclusion of these kinds of unexpected openings into other worlds is RUSH HOUR's greatest strength. It is not the first journal to try to reach the young adult market. Cricket Magazine Group has already given us CICADA, a gentle and imaginative magazine that includes short stories and essays from contemporary authors, as well as classics from the past. I believe there is room in the literary world for both publications. RUSH HOUR dares to push the envelope and takes on some of the more controversial issues, and readers well beyond the intended age group will appreciate this journal.<br />(...)	2004-05-17

Blair does not want to go to Hawaii with her newly blended stepfamily and very pregnant mother. Serena offers rescue in the form of a skiing trip to Sun Valley, along with her hot brother Erik. A sober Nate is also going to Sun Valley with his new girlfriend from rehab. Daniel lands an interesting internship at a hot new NY literary magazine. Vanessa tries to keep her films from her eccentric parents. And Jenny tries to find out why boyfriend Leo is so mysterious. In other words, it's business as usual for these characters.<br />I LIKE IT LIKE THAT seems to be preparing readers for major upcoming events: Blair still doesn't know what college she will be attending; she and Nate still dance around each other; Blair's mother still has not had the baby, but events help Blair come to terms with this in the book; and Daniel goes back and forth with Vanessa. Plenty of humor does keep things moving here, especially concerning Daniel's internship and Blair's efforts to impress Serena's brother Erik. A crazy caper where Serena is almost arrested naked is another little surprise that keeps the book fresh.<br />My only reservation is when the book falls into the stereotypical angst about virginity and guys. Hopefully, this series will not head into a typical Hollywood-esque Prom/Graduation story and will continue to surprise readers. Nevertheless, I LIKE IT LIKE THAT is a fun and light read, filled with the delicious designer details that are the signature of this series.<br />   --- Reviewed by Amy Alessio	2004-05-17

Vicar Demurral has stolen a powerful religious relic called the Keruvim. When he attains the second Keruvim, Demurral will be omnipotent and able to become the supreme being of all creation. To that end, with the power of the first Keruvim, he conjures a tremendous storm, which wrecks a ship carrying the second sacred object. The other Keruvim, however, eludes him.<br />Thomas, a near orphan, is saved from drowning by Raphah, an African teenager surviving the shipwreck. Raphah recruits Thomas to help steal back the Keruvim, stolen from Raphah's people. Thomas hates the despicable vicar and is determined to help Raphah wrest from the vicar the power obtained through thievery. His friend, Kate, helps the two boys enter the vicarage through a tunnel. Thomas escapes from the vicar, but he and Kate run headlong into a gruesome battle with giant evil warriors called Varrigal. The two cannot even hope to win the fight against these horrific supernatural creatures. Yet somehow they triumph.<br />Meanwhile, Raphah is imprisoned by Demurral, branded as his slave, and sent to the shale mine. Thomas and Kate are offered a chance to help their friend, who is said to be otherwise \\"as good as dead.\\" But are they walking into their own deaths? The ultimate fate of the earth and all its beings rests in the hands of Kate, Thomas and Raphah. Can they save earth and heaven from being lost forever to evil?<br />SHADOWMANCER is an exciting adventure with unforeseen plot twists and terrifying shocks, filled with blackest despair and joyous triumph. G. P. Taylor weaves a fine tapestry of earthly and spiritual battles, complete with characters and references seemingly biblical in nature (although ambiguous enough to possibly represent faiths other than Christianity).<br />SHADOWMANCER has been billed as \\"hotter than Potter\\"; its scope is much more epic, faith-based and disturbing than the Harry Potter novels. Fantasy readers who can handle significant religious symbolism threaded through a \\"can't put it down\\" adventure will welcome this first book of a planned trilogy as a future classic.<br />   (...)	2004-05-17
