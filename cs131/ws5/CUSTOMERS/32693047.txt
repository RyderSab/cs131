Books	2	28	38	N	N	Grace gets lost in the mix	I have read and reviewed The Jesus I Never Knew and Rumors of Another World by Yancey and loved them both...See reviews on those pages.<br /><br />However, I was completely disappointed with this book.  There are few pages on which Yancey does not accuse and condemn the church for various imperfections.  He uses several stories to show how the church lacks grace.  Several of these include non-Christians accusing Christians of lacking grace.  Yancey seems to side with any who condemn Christians for what they deem as \\"ungrace.\\" One example is an addicted mother of a 2 yr old girl who has prostituted the girl for drug money.  She states she did not go to a church because they would make her feel bad.  This story opens the book and is referred to several times to show how bad the church is.  Similar stories reminded me of the statement of Jesus that sinners avoid the light because they love the deeds of darkness not because the church lacks grace.<br /><br />I know the church is not perfect, but it is the only body of Christ, and I love it, despite its faults.  Yancey pummels the church over and over.<br /><br />He also advocates what seems to be an acceptance of sinners (except Christians who sin in their zeal for righteousness) which is good but also an ambivalence toward sin which is not congruent with Scripture.  Grace AND Truth come through Christ.  Yancey illustrates his \\"grace\\" by writing about marching with his friend in a gay pride parade and supporting him as he leaves his wife and family to purse a promiscous gay lifestyle.<br /><br />Yancey goes far beyond loving and accepting all people as Christ does to embracing them in their lifestyle without bringing them out of it.<br /><br />He also never defines grace or paints a picture of it.  His book creates a picture of a vague sentimentalism that is unwilling to define good & evil behavior. He writes more of mercy and forgiveness than grace.<br /><br />I did not have a much better understanding of grace than I did before reading this book. What I did have was a bad taste in my spirit from his negativity toward the Church.  I think the only Christians he complimented for their sincerity and faithfulness were Bill and Hillary Clinton.<br /><br />This book varies little from what I have read from non-Christian writers like Wayne Dyer, Marianne Williamson, Dalia Lama, Harold Kushner, Deepak Chopra.  It conforms more with cultural trends than with the Bible.<br /><br />Of course, alot of other readers have loved it, and I have certainly enjoyed his other books, so I may have missed the point. I would welcome feedback but my advice is to skip this one.s a bad taste in my spirit from his negativity toward the Church.

Koontz paints a horrific picture of an end-of-the-world scenario as experienced through the eyes of a young couple.<br /><br />What seems like some sort of cross between an alien invasion and night of the living dead combines with the evil nature of some sociopathic characters in this doomsday night of terror.  But Koontz offers something deeper than the typical sci-fi saga.  He entwines a Biblical theme that creates a deeper meaning in the plot.<br /><br />Koontz, as usual, works dogs into the mix as somewhat heroic characters.  For us dog lovers, this is something we enjoy in Koontz' books.<br /><br />I think this is a good try by Koontz to expand the horizons of his writing and incorporate some spiritual themes to accompany his typical good v. evil scenarios.  I believe Koontz conveys a more insightful grasp of the nature of evil than any other writer I know.<br /><br />If your a Koontz fan, don't hesitate to pick this one up.	2005-07-05

Asch excels in describing the culture, geography, politics and religious atmosphere in which Christ lived.  Although, this book is slow in action, it is truly rich in character and background development. Readers of the Bible will see many of its holes filled in by knowledgeable contentions on the part of Asch who seems a keen expert on the times of Christ.<br /><br />He oddly uses a narrative technique involving citizens of 1930's Poland who have connected with their past lives.  In their past lives, they interacted in the events surrounding Christ's life, and they tell the story from their past lives' perspective.  I found this aspect of the novel strange and unnecessary.  Asch could have excluded the \\"reincarnation\\" scenario and just scripted an historical novel based on the known events of Christ's life.<br /><br />This is not a quick read and was slow and methodical but provides such insight into Biblical events that it is worthwhile.  Asch is a jewish writer but does not contradict Christian beliefs; he rather offers the reader varying accounts of characters in the book, as history itself has done.	2005-03-28

Beginning with a quote from Disney's Lion King, \\"You are more than you have become,\\" Evans takes the reader on a journey of discovering the true born again believer.<br /><br />Evans has written The EncourageMint with you in mind...the you that was, that is and that can be through the redemptive work of Jesus.  He has a you in mind that will shake your complacency, shatter your doubt, empower your faith, and dare you to believe in it.<br /><br />Evans is the Founder and Senior Elder of Encouraging Word Church located in downtown Charleston.  He also writes a regular column for the Holy City Chronicle.  He describes himself as an expert at discovering, developing and maximizing the potential in people by helping them find, follow and finish their course.<br /><br />The EncourageMint is a treasure trove of daily readings of faith, wisdom and revelation that flow from God's mind through Evan's pen to the reader.  These devotional readings startled me with their powerful impact.  I cannot help but to place this book on the same level as that famous daily devotional My Utmost for His Highest. Yes, this is that good.<br /><br />Some daily readings are as short as a brief paragraph, and others are a full page.  They are all purposeful, efficient and meaningful.<br /><br />Evans writes from a unique perspective.  He introduces himself as a man who has experienced failure-hard failure and has risen from the ashes to help others who have been disappointed and disillusioned in themselves.  Evans is a man who identifies not with the righteous Pharisee but with the humble tax collector, a sinner, thanking God for mercy and grace and rising to follow the Good Shepherd.  He writes simply to the heart of the matter on 366 topics that all begin with \\"You Are...\\"<br /><br />We all know who we are in the world, in our flesh, our weakness, our vulgarity, our temptations, our guilt and shame.

Each step is captured in a stunning picture or two.  That ends with his death on the cross and then a visual image indicating his resurrection.  This is akin to a visual tool to follow the stations of the cross and allow their significance to sink in.  In that way, this book becomes interactive as a prayer and devotional tool.<br /><br />There are also some pictures of the filming of the movie that provide a glimpse of Mel Gibson and the actors setting the stage for the movie.<br /><br />I think this book is a must-have for anyone who appreciated the movie The Passion or for anyone who is a Christian but was not willing to endure watching the suffering of Christ in the movie.  Although I strongly recommend the movie and the book, the book offers a more bearable way to see what he endured and to appreciate his sacrifice for those who avoided the movie.	2005-02-01

Her story demonstrates the truth of the scriptures warning of wolves in sheeps clothing who will come to tear apart the church.  She shows that there are indeed wolves in the church and that they indeed resemble sheep.  However, these wolves are, like Satan, prowling around seeking whom they may devour.  Ms. Drayton shows the battle that rages at such times when true believers seek God and face opposition of Satan and his minions.  The witchcraft she faced is described in summary as people \\"praying\\" against her and her family.  She and her family suffered during this time, but she praises God that He blessed her in the battle and brought her through victoriously.<br /><br />She also shares a good bit of personal testimony about how God has worked on her behalf in her career, children and marriage.  She offers many scriptures to support her points and stories, and she concludes with a helpful chapter in which she lists many of the things she has learned through her experience.<br /><br />It would be much better to learn about witchcraft in the church by reading this book rather than experiencing it yourself by surprise.  Ms. Drayton's account is eerily similar to an experience I had in the church at the hands of two fellow pastors.  It happens because wolves want control and power, and they are very intimidated and threatened by servants of the Lord.<br /><br />This is a well written book that will bless you and warn you.	2005-01-06

In a well-written and simple expose, Dr. Angell writes quite an indictment against some of the larger drug companies who are deceiving the public, bilking the taxpayers and buying favorable legislation while offering very little in the form of innovative and helpful products.<br /><br />Dr. Angell devotes chapters to the myth of research and development costs cited as reasons why drugs cost Americans so much.  She shows that most innovative research takes place at taxpayers expense and then profits the drug companies.  She shows how drug companies deceive consumers with bait and switch practices, deceptive advertising, and high prices.  A chapter focuses on the shady ways that drug companies \\"pay\\" doctors and hospitals to prescribe their drugs over better and cheaper alternatives.  Of course, much is devoted to exposing the cozy relationship with between pharmaceuticals and Washington that leads to legislation favoring drug companies and sticking it to taxpayers.<br /><br />I think the information in this book should be known by everyone who is consistently taking prescribed medication or visiting doctors who treat patients by prescribing the latest product.  According to the author, about all doctors are influenced by the marketing and gifts of the drug companies, and that influence effects the treatment patients receive--for better or worse.  Readers will also learn how drug companies get drugs approved with relatively little solid testing of the drugs efficacy and safety.<br /><br />Dr. Angell does not cite many successes in patient care or positive attributes of the pharmaceutical industry (I assume there are some).  She focuses on the negative practices that are hurting consumers.<br /><br />We are influenced in one way or another by the propaganda of the drug companies.  It is important to hear the other side of the issue by someone as informed as Dr. Angell.

St. John of the Cross illustrates the product of his earnest seeking of God in this book that seems to gain wisdom and understanding that are on a level rarely if ever seen in books.<br /><br />I was literally amazed at how this book explained the events I had experienced on my spiritual journey.  Unlike most books that speak of blessings, man's abilities, reaching goals through God, this book focuses on the time in the desert, the purging of man's heart, the dying to all things not of God, the journey in the valley of the shadow of death, and the purposes of God for our soul.  It offers the reader a different view of spirituality than the modern books, because like few men or women before him or since, St. John of the Cross shunned the pleasures of the world to gain the fullness of God's presence.<br /><br />His writing is sometimes difficult to read because it is so heavy with spritual wisdom and assumes a high level of spiritual and theological maturity in the reader.  I read more than a few lines several times before I got the point--I read this over several weeks...a chapter or so at a time.<br /><br />I recommend this for readers seeking a closer relationship for God and for those seeking understanding about spiritually dry and difficult times in their lives.  No other book I have read offers such a deep description of times when God seems distant and his blessings amiss.<br /><br />St. John of the Cross inspires one to seek God more fully and in earnest.	2005-01-03

The writing is exceptional for its intelligence, breadth of topics, and creativity, but the book itself gets bogged down with lengthy tangents that include the pedestrian activities of four college seniors and their relationships.<br /><br />The meat of the story centers on an ancient text that promises to reveal astounding mysteries.  The process that two of the Princeton seniors follow to crack the code of this book is suspenseful and enjoyable.  They also have to deal with conniving professors attempting to steal their work and the potential breakthrough.<br /><br />I ended up skimming through the last 100 pages to skip the thorough descriptions of Princeton life and the streams of consciousness of the narrator in order to get through with the story.<br /><br />Throughout this story there are scenes that remind me of the keystone cops as the students seem to play games with the campus police when in fact they are in life or death scenarios apparently.<br /><br />The story never convinces me of the importance of the events or characters despite its efforts to paint a world revolving around four Princeton seniors.<br /><br />Overall this is a good effort to combine suspense and mystery with substance such as character development and philosophy coming through the narrator's reflections about his past, present and future--these include some memorable insights by the authors, but I found this nearly poetic writing often just interfered with a good mystery.  The authors can be forgiven and cut some slack for that, since the book shapes up nicely in the conclusion.	2004-12-31

The prayer , as discussed by Dr. Wilkinson, does not lead us to ask for \\"stuff\\" but blessings that involve interaction with God and experiencing his presence.  Dr. Wilkinson's examples of his own blessings from the Jabez prayer all involve ministry and really blessing other people by God working through him.  Contrary to several reviews' statements, this book is not about materialism or selfishness.<br /><br />An example from the author's life is about him leading a youth group to evangelize children and beachgoers.  They led many to Christ as they exceeding their own reach and allowed God to \\"enlarge their territory\\" in ministry.  This is the idea of Wilkinson's book:  to live the Bible.<br /><br />He basis his ideas on the brief passage of scripture, but his expansions of the ideas involve the big picture of living for Christ.<br /><br />This book is as much a testimony of God's work in the author's life and through the author as it is about a prayer, but Dr. Wilkinson gives all the credit to God and to his own attitude toward God that has been shaped by his adherence to the principles revealed in this brief prayer from the Bible.<br /><br />Dr. Wilkinson writes simply and profoundly about the context of the prayer and elaborates on each line of it.  This book will lead you into a fuller experience of the abundant life Jesus came to give us--if you will follow its guidelines and not try to make them conform to a worldly point of view.<br /><br />I think people reacting negatively to this book are reacting to something other than is on the pages of it.<br /><br />This is a book to read on a regular basis as a supplement to scripture.  It serves to inspire a renewed vigor in prayers.	2004-12-15

Reading Spytimes is no different (except for the sex scenes that were arkward and cumbersome).  It was an introduction for me to this era of subterfuge within our government.  I was not familiar at all with the historical characters of the novel, so I did not have the background data that other reviewers have possessed.<br /><br />I found the book engaging but not thrilling or suspenseful.  It flowed consistently and held my attention.  It is good historical fiction, providing enlightenment and fabricating details to fill in spaces.  This book is not lengthy so did not go into much character depth or background information on situations.<br /><br />It is revealing about the CIA and counterintelligence process, as well as the divided loyalties of high officials.  I'm sure Buckley draws on much personal knowledge to offer readers a realistic view of the intelligence realm of government.<br /><br />I think it is a worthy read for those who have interest in spy stories and who appreciate fine writing.

He offers his book as a response to the high rate of failure among marriages in North America.  He notes that the divorce rate among Christians equals that of non-Christians.<br /><br />Although Dr. Gary Smalley authors the book, he draws on the expertise, lessons and experience of his family and associates that are involved in the Smalley Marriage Institute and Smalley Relationship Center.  His sons, Michael and Dr. Greg Smalley, along with associate Robert Paul, contribute heavily to the substance of the book.  The wisdom learned about marriages from marriage seminars called Marriage Intensives conducted by the Smalley Marriage Institute provide the foundation for the themes of the book.<br /><br />Dr. Smalley claims that certain recurring patterns in marriages undermine the quality of the relationship and can devastate the marriage.  He calls the most destructive pattern the fear dance.  Dr. Smalley writes that this is a destructive dance that couples routinely act out due to core fears influencing their actions.  Identifying and eliminating the fear dance becomes a primary goal for couples.<br /><br />Another lesson that Dr. Smalley teaches is that the apparent problem for couples is rarely the real problem.  He advises couples to look beyond the surface and the arguments to the feelings behind the words.  This is a process that he suggests will contribute to better communications and fewer arguments between spouses.<br /><br />Readers will learn what Dr. Smalley calls the \\"power of one.\\"  He writes that individuals must learn the power of their own choices, including choices about thoughts, feelings and actions within a relationship.  The power of one includes the responsibility to care for oneself and to take charge of one's life-not giving up one's choice for happiness and fulfillment to another person.<br /><br />He encourages couples to create a safe environment where both spouses are able to share openly, to be secure and comforted.  Effective communication requires a safe, welcoming environment, claims Dr. Smalley, and this leads to an energetic and vibrant relationship.<br /><br />An important principle Dr. Smalley teaches in the book involves a win-win attitude within a relationship.  He encourages spouses to never see themselves as on different teams against one another, because a marriage or family is one team.  The only desirable outcome is for everyone to win.  Dr. Smalley argues that within a marriage if one partner loses an argument, for example, both spouses still end up losers in the situation.<br /><br />Throughout The DNA of Relationships, Dr. Smalley uses many examples from his marriage and his associates' marriages.  For every major point he makes, he offers several illustrative and practical examples for the reader.<br /><br />Perhaps the most influential chapter in the book is the final chapter in which Dr. Smalley recounts his heart attack and near-death experience that gave him a keen and greater appreciation for the value of relationships.  In this chapter, as in the others, Dr. Smalley reminds readers of the importance of their relationship with God.another person. <br /> <br />He encourages couples to create a safe environment where both spouses are able to share openly, to be secure and comforted.

Faith and Fortune, grew out of a 2001 article in Fortune entitled \\"God and Business: The Surprising Quest for Spiritual Renewal in the American Workplace.\\" He writes that this article generated much more response than his previous 60 articles.  Gunther discovered a movement among businesses to place greater value on spirituality and social responsibility.<br /><br />In this book, he investigates the drivers behind the presence of faith and values in the workplace and the initiatives occurring as a result.<br /><br />Gunther does not endorse or focus on a particular religion or faith tradition.  He explains his approach to writing Faith and Fortune, \\"Faith provides the fuel that energizes these people as they strive to do business better.  Some have faith in God.  Others do not.  But all of them have faith in the goodness of people, faith in the possibility of change, and perhaps most surprising, faith that corporations can become a powerful force for good in the world.\\"<br /><br />Through the profiles and conversations that Gunther presents, he shows that living by spiritual values and practicing social responsibility have become good business in America.<br /><br />Gunther begins his look at faith and business with the historical profile of J.C. Penny.  Gunther writes about how Penny's Christianity informed all of his business decisions from day one.  Penny serves as an example of how a leader can combine faith and business for lasting success and goodwill.<br /><br />Readers will learn about Tom Chappell who, along with his wife and a $5000 loan, started Tom's of Maine in 1970 to \\"Do what is good for people. Do what is good for the environment, and make money doing it.\\"  In 2003, Tom's of Maine sold over $35 million worth of healthy, natural products while practicing capitalism with a heart and soul.<br /><br />Gunther illustrates how Herb Kelleher, inspired by his faith and a desire to change the way airlines do business, created Southwest Air, the most successful airline to date.  His practice of servant-leadership has helped change corporate culture globally for the better.<br /><br />Some of the other corporations shown to be doing good as well as earning profits are Timberland, UPS, Hewlett-Packard, Herman Miller, Starbucks and Staples.  Some began with values-driven founders who instilled the business with their faith and philosophies.  Others like Staples and PepsiCo are changing their approach to environmental and health concerns based on the feedback of the community and a growing conviction among their leaders of their responsibility to do good.<br /><br />In a few of the cases profiled, the values applied to the workforce may seem in contrast with conservative Christian values as they promote non-Christian spirituality or corporate benefits for same-sex partners.  Throughout the book however, Gunther effectively illustrates how people incorporate their beliefs and values into business to do good for all.  He does not address whether their beliefs are right or wrong.<br /><br />When analyzing the best practices of the businesses or leaders he profiles, his writing skills and business acumen shine.  He covers almost the full spectrum of perspectives by interviewing a variety people, including a priest, a minister and a rabbi.  Faith and Fortune paints an inspiring and encouraging picture of American business that I think the dark clouds of scandal have hidden.  Readers will be thankful for Gunther's efforts and pleased at how he deftly presents the topic.  They can gain a greater awareness of ways their faith can serve God through their businesses and professions.reater awareness of ways their faith can serve God through their businesses and professions. <br />	2004-11-17

Jakes quoted a University of Houston sociology professor saying that Jakes is \\"incredible in how he's able to diagnose people's pain.  He has an uncanny ability to put a finger on the human condition.\\" Jakes' new book He-Motions illustrates the verity of the professor's statement.  In He-Motions, Jakes nails the issues and challenges Christian men face today in trying to fulfill their many roles and pursue their dreams.<br /><br />Jakes writes from his heart and soul as a pastor, father, husband and entrepreneur.  In the opening pages, he describes his motivation for writing: \\"I want to share what I've learned.  I want to cut through so much of the junk imposed on men today and talk heart to heart about what it means to be a man, not in some touchy-feely group hug kind of way but in an honest, soul-bearing way, which also respects men and honors the women who love them and whom they love.\\"<br /><br />Jakes thoroughly succeeds in fulfilling his desire for this book.  Not only does he address male readers, but he also targets female readers who hope to gain insights about men.  Jakes' no-holds barred writing offers refreshing candor for those wanting an honest assessment of who they are and where they are in life.<br /><br />Jakes writes about his childhood, his ministry, his family and his ups and downs in life-always tying stories to life lessons for readers.  It does not take the reader long to discern that Jakes possesses a vast breadth of wisdom and understanding about the inner workings of men in our culture.<br /><br />Jakes writes that \\"a man must value himself.\\"  He-Motions can help readers make great strides in finding value in themselves-regardless of their circumstances.  He encourages men to refuse to become discouraged but to keep moving toward their destiny while simultaneously enjoying the splendid moments of life's journey.<br /><br />The book is written as if Jakes is in the room having a one-on-one talk with the reader.  If it was in fact such a talk, it would surely involve laughing, weeping, praying and dreaming.  One such example of the conversational style is when Jakes writes about balancing family and career.<br /><br />He writes, \\"I'm here to tell you that if you don't contain your work life and segregate it from your home life, then your career will consume the marriage like a campfire blazing outside of its circle of rocks and roaring into a life-threatening forest fire.\\"<br /><br />There is not an area of discussion where Jakes lets men off the hook.  He writes authoritatively about power, money and sex.  In the financial arena, Jakes commands readers, \\"Stop asking God to bless an area where you refuse to obey His Word for your life.\\"<br /><br />In one relationship area after another, Jakes' writing leads the reader to self-examination, awareness, forgiveness and improvement.  His writing on subjects such as a man's relationships with his father, children, wife, other men, time, money and God is honest and down to earth.  It is also practical, as are the questions for men and women at the end of each chapter.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Jakes references the life of David to shed light on the above relationships from a Biblical perspective.<br /><br />Jakes encourages readers that \\"someone needs to know who you are and where you are at all times in your walk and life.\\"  This book could be an effective tool to use in a discussion or accountability group to help people grow stronger relationships.

According to Michael Evans' latest book, The American Prophecies, America's place in the future depends on whether America stands with or against Israel.<br /><br />The book's title is a bit misleading.  Evans does not reveal scriptures that specifically discuss America's future or place in God's plan.  The prophecies discussed deal with the nation of Israel.  Evans argues the following regarding America's future, \\"It is time for us to wake up, but will that awakening be a great or rude awakening?  According to Genesis 12:3, God told Abraham that He would `bless those who bless you, and...curse him who curses you.\\"<br /><br />Throughout the book, he questions whether America will be a blessing or curse to Israel.  The answer to this question will determine our nation's future writes Evans.<br /><br />Evans is a Christian minister, author, political advisor and founder of the Jerusalem Prayer Team.  In The American Prophecies, he also writes as an historian investigating the historical relationship between America and the Jewish people.<br /><br />From President Washington to President George W. Bush, Evans reviews attitudes and interactions with the Jewish people and Israel.  This history is insightful and revealing, even disturbing when considering our lack of consistent support and advocacy for Jews who have been under constant threat during the last century.<br /><br />Evans writes that America's attempts to act as a friend to Israel and as a partner with Arab countries has placed it \\"squarely in the eye of the storm of biblical prophecy.\\"  He details specific examples of American Presidents straddling the fence between Israel and its sworn enemies.<br /><br />He looks specifically at the history of Saudi Arabia and our relationship to it.  An integral part of Saudi Arabia's history is its support and spread of the Islamic sect called Wahhabism.  Evans reveals that this sect believes God approves and rewards the killing of those not following its strict religion.  Since its beginning, Saudi Arabia has funded and supported this religion.  It has produced terrorists that hate Israel and America and are comfortable with killing any it deems as \\"infidels,\\" even women and children.<br /><br />Evans is critical of America's history of selling weapons to Saudi Arabia and other enemies of Israel.  This began in 1978 when President Carter initiated the sale of 50 F-15 jets to the nation.  Essentially, America has armed Israel and also those who want to destroy it.<br /><br />He also criticizes American Presidents who have negotiated with terrorists such as Yasser Arafat who was the most welcomed foreign leader to the White House during the Clinton Presidency while the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu was shunned from its doors.<br /><br />He urges the church in America to become earnest in prayer for Israel and America.  He writes that, \\"As it was with Daniel, God needs someone to agree with Him, pray His promises into reality, and carry out His plan on the earth.\\"<br /><br />Evans warns readers that the last days are here.  His hope for America is that it will discard its liberal tendency toward globalization and will align itself so closely with Israel that our places in biblical prophecy will be indistinguishable from each other.<br /><br />He appropriately balances his Old Testament references and emphasis on nationalism with discussing the hope Christians have in Christ.  Evans believes he will return soon to gather believers to himself prior to the tribulation of prophecy.  This, he writes, is another reason for the church to wake up and focus on attracting new believers to the family of Christ, including Jews and Muslims.<br /><br />The American Prophecies is an important book for Americans to read.

But I'm sure they are founded in truth.<br /><br />Grisham follows through on this story and closes well (unlike The King of Torts which fizzles at the end).

The plot is believable in this time of constant terror warnings.  The writing is intelligent and smooth.<br /><br />I think the conclusion is the main area where Reich did not hit his usual home run.

Although Weigel, a leading authority and writer on the Catholic Church, targets young Catholics and writes in a conversational style-thus the title, this book mentors all Christians seeking guidance in their relationship with Christ.<br /><br />Weigel demonstrates a vast understanding of theology, history, geography, architecture and culture, and he orchestrates these topics to share the essentials truths of living the Christian life with his readers.  Letters to a Young Catholic consists of fourteen letters/chapters addressing the key elements that Weigel considers important to modern Catholics and to all Christian disciples.<br /><br />Some of Weigel's writing discusses practices particular to the Catholic Church, but even these apply and are relevant to Christians in general.  Of the Catholic Church, he writes, \\"while Catholicism is a body of beliefs and a way of life, Catholicism is also an optic, a way of seeing things, a distinctive perception of reality.\\"  In Weigel's view, this body of beliefs and perception of reality is based on eternal truths that are at once both liberating and binding for the believers.<br /><br />Weigel takes the reader on tours of sacred sites such as St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, the Sepulcher of Jesus and Chartres Cathedral in France.  He uses these sacrosanct sites to share truths and point to the beauty, suffering, redemption, devotion and community found in the Christian story.<br /><br />In one letter, he highlights St. Mary's Catholic Church in Greenville, SC.  He shares the story of the church's priest, Father Jay Scott Newman, and his dynamic relationship with his burgeoning congregation to teach about prayer and the presence of Christ in the community of the church.<br /><br />Another compelling chapter shares an episode from Pope John Paul II's life as a young adult in Nazi occupied Poland.  The young man, Karol Wojtyla, heard and nurtured his calling in the underground catacombs that became a makeshift seminary.  His only other classmate was killed by the Nazis during the occupation.  The future Pope lived a clandestine disciple's life from age 19 to 24 years old.<br /><br />Weigel dramatically shares this profile of the Pope as an example of the Christian life.  He similarly shares stories and quotes of G.K. Chesterton, Cardinal John Henry Newman, Flannery O'Connor and several other Catholics whose lives touched their own and future generations.<br /><br />There are no subjects touching Catholicism that Weigel avoids.  He acknowledges the weaknesses and failures within the Catholic Church.  He confronts the abuse scandals, the political/cultural issues about sex, gender, reproduction, and the theological controversies about the Catholic focus on Mary, the mother of Jesus.  On all such issues, he adroitly acknowledges the tensions and then unassumingly states what he believes are the truths so central to the Catholic doctrine.<br /><br />Even on such a weighty issue as the necessity of suffering, Weigel displays exceptional spiritual insights, along with an uncanny ability to convey his ideas to readers as if he were just writing a simple letter to a devotee.  Weigel writes that \\"suffering makes us the kind of people who can live with Love itself, without suffering from it or getting bored by it.\\"  He moves the reader's attention to an \\"eternity of unfolding understanding and friendship and love.\\"<br /><br />Weigel's sharp comprehension of the Christian faith is identified in his statement, \\"faith in Jesus Christ costs not just something, but everything.  It demands all of us, not just part of us.\\"  This belief informs his view of Catholicism as a religion that accepts the \\"really real\\" view of life in Jesus Christ in which \\"everything is of consequence, because everything has been redeemedby Christ.\\"<br /><br />If you are a Catholic or non-Catholic who is serious about your relationship to Jesus and his body-the church, I think you will enjoy this book and benefit from reading it and meditating on its messages.rything has been redeemed by Christ.\\" <br /> <br />If you are a Catholic or non-Catholic who is serious about your relationship to Jesus and his body-the church, I think you will enjoy this book and benefit from reading it and meditating on its messages.	2004-08-13

Jordan Rubin emphatically says there is in The Maker's Diet. Based on his study of scriptures, health and nutrition, and his own experience of sickness and recovery, Rubin presents a diet and overall wellness plan that he believes lines up with God's plan for healthy people.<br /><br /> The Maker's Diet begins with Rubin's inspiring story of his battle with severe Crohn?s disease. His doctors called his case the worst they had seen. During college, Rubin went from the picture of health to death's doorstep--6'1 and weighing 111 pounds due to digestive problems related to Crohn's disease. Rather than giving up after over a year of sickness, Rubin clung to his faith in God and sought one more solution. The final try was a man who had developed a Biblically-based diet and health plan. This early version of the Maker's Diet saved Rubin's life and led to his complete recovery and healing over the course of several months. He includes astounding before and after pictures of himself that demonstrate the diet's effect.<br /><br /> This experience inspired Rubin to enhance the Biblically-based diet through additional research and create Garden of Life, a health and wellness company.<br /><br /> Rubin's in-depth analysis of the typical American's diet compared to what he considers to be a healthy, nutritious diet impacted me. In the recent weeks since reading the book, I have changed my grocery shopping and eating habits to better follow the book's general guidelines for healthy eating.<br /><br /> Rubin emphasizes the benefits of natural and organic foods in contrast to the nutritional deficits found in processed and engineered foods. He also compares the nutritional value of foods God included in the diet plan for the Israelites versus those excluded such as pork and shellfish.<br /><br /> While he makes no claims that his diet is a &quot;cure-all,&quot; he believes &quot;the book was inspired by God and that the practical protocol it contains can greatly improve your health.&quot;<br /><br /> The Maker's Diet offers a 40-day diet plan targeting not only weight loss but overall health and disease prevention. It consists of three phases. The general diet is a list of foods to enjoy and foods to avoid during the phases. For example, Rubin encourages readers to enjoy beef but to avoid pork. For all of the food, he recommends natural, organic or free range products for reasons he specifies. He includes sample meals and recipes. His diet also includes regular fasting for physical and spiritual health.<br /><br /> His Garden of Life company supplies many nutritional supplements and products to complement the diet. He recommends some of these but also lists various other suppliers of natural foods and products for the reader's benefit.<br /><br /> Some of Rubin's comments focus on healthcare and exercise. These are not Rubin's areas of expertise. His sincere though pedestrian writing about these topics offers little insight and may do a disservice to readers who follow his advice too literally. At times he seems combative toward the medical profession, as he contradicts what physicians and medical experts would advise regarding medicine, vaccinations and exercise.<br /><br /> He does come across as an expert in nutrition and natural remedies.

I found enough treasures in it to keep me going, but it was tough.<br />The book is strong on character development and dialogue but weak on action and plot advancement.  Dostoyevsky takes many opportunities to discuss philosophy, theology/spirituality and politics.  Most of these treatsies are enlightening as are the characters speaking.<br />I have so often seen quotations taken from this book that I expected to enjoy it much more than I did.

Jordan Rubin emphatically says there is in The Maker's Diet. Based on his study of scriptures, health and nutrition, and his own experience of sickness and recovery, Rubin presents a diet and overall wellness plan that he believes lines up with God's plan for healthy people.<br />The Maker's Diet begins with Rubin's inspiring story of his battle with severe Crohn's disease.  His doctors called his case the worst they had seen.  During college, Rubin went from the picture of health to death's doorstep-6'1 and weighing 111 pounds due to digestive problems related to Crohn's disease.  Rather than giving up after over a year of sickness, Rubin clung to his faith in God and sought one more solution.  The final try was a man who had developed a Biblically-based diet and health plan.  This early version of the Maker's Diet saved Rubin's life and led to his complete recovery and healing over the course of several months.  He includes astounding before and after pictures of himself that demonstrate the diet's effect.<br />This experience inspired Rubin to enhance the Biblically-based diet through additional research and create Garden of Life, a health and wellness company.<br />Rubin's in-depth analysis of the typical American's diet compared to what he considers to be a healthy, nutritious diet impacted me.  In the recent weeks since reading the book, I have changed my grocery shopping and eating habits to better follow the book's general guidelines for healthy eating.<br />Rubin emphasizes the benefits of natural and organic foods in contrast to the nutritional deficits found in processed and engineered foods.  He also compares the nutritional value of foods God included in the diet plan for the Israelites versus those excluded such as pork and shellfish.<br />While he makes no claims that his diet is a \\"cure-all,\\" he believes \\"the book was inspired by God and that the practical protocol it contains can greatly improve your health.\\"<br />The Maker's Diet offers a 40-day diet plan targeting not only weight loss but overall health and disease prevention.

Defoe's novel is fresh  and intriguing today just as it was when written.<br />Defoe's language reveals classic appreciation of the English language that really appealed to me as a reader.  His narrative accounts of adventure, shipwrecks and survival are precise and captivating.  this book is made up of many short stories tied together in following the main character.  The character grows and matures through his trials and becomes a man worthy of emulation.<br />Defoe shows brilliant insight into humanity through his writing as his main character challenges nature, savages, and his inner darkness.  I enjoyed the spiritual aspects of the book.  Any close look at a character such as Crusoe would be lacking if it did not follow his spiritual transformation as well as his physical changes.<br />There are some brief slow parts interspersed in the book that are more like speedbumps in a great tale that many have tried to imitate but failed.	2004-06-08

Public schools and universities continue to teach these theories as the exclusive explanations for the formation of the universe, living creatures and human consciousness.  As recently as last month a scientist believing in a Creator was scratched from an NPR program discussing creation, and teachers are still prohibited from criticizing Darwinism or favorably discussing intelligent design theories in public schools.<br />But is science really backing up Darwin and the spontaneous creation of the universe?  Is belief in God as the Creator of all things consistent with the latest discoveries in science?  Lee Strobel's latest book, The Case for a Creator, attempts to determine and explain whether the arrow of science is pointing in the direction of God or Darwin.<br />Strobel presents solid scientific and philosophical evidence supporting the idea that God as Creator is the only reasonable theory for creation.  Strobel's case is built on information garnered from interviews with several experts in the fields of biology, physics, cosmology, astronomy, biochemistry and the human mind.<br />Strobel's latest book follows the patterns of his previous books, The Case for Christ and The Case for Faith.  In all three books Strobel creates a narrative of investigative journalism delving into the mysteries in question.<br />The Case for a Creator begins with Strobel providing an introduction to the conflict between theories of Darwinian evolution and intelligent design.  He gives his own history of buying into the godless theories of creation hook, line and sinker during his years in high school and college.  It was his faith in these theories that led him to accept atheism as a reasonable approach to life.  His later investigations into the evidence for Christ and faith led him to reject atheism and to accept Christ as Lord and Savior.<br />The premise for this book is found in a quote by Stephen Meyer, Ph. D, one of the experts interviewed by Strobel.  He says, \\"Science and faith are not at war.  When scientific evidence and biblical teaching are correctly interpreted, they can and do support each other.  I'd say to anyone who doubts that: investigate the evidence yourself.\\"<br />The Case for a Creator invites readers to investigate the evidence.  Strobel lays it out for you in as readable a manner as I think possible.<br />Critics claim that Strobel sets the table in favor of a Creator by interviewing only experts who believe in the Creator rather than other theories.  It is true that he does not interview any atheistic scientists, but he uses many of their arguments to query the experts he interviews.<br />In fact, he regular quotes Darwin and his supporters.  He quotes several other opposing scientists such as Stephen Hawking and Stephen Jay Gould.  Strobel presents many of the theories opposing theism.  What becomes clear while reading this book is that many educators and researchers are committed to keeping God out of the equation at all costs, even at the cost of clinging to outdated and imaginative theories of creation.<br />Strobel gives his readers plentiful ammunition to attack the theories espoused by the evolutionists and atheists in any arena.  As he shows, the holes in atheistic theories require much more faith to fill than is required to believe that an intelligent God created all things according to Biblical truths.heism and to accept Christ as Lord and Savior.<br />The premise for this book is found in a quote by Stephen Meyer, Ph.

Although the holiday bearing his name has become associated with legend and myth, St. Patrick, the man, lived such a life that warrants admiration and commendation from Christians everywhere.  The man behind the myths exemplifies the Christian life of sacrifice, reliance on God, love and passion for souls, and unfoundering hope in eternal life through Jesus Christ.<br />Philip Freeman's book St. Patrick of Ireland presents the life and times of St. Patrick.  Patrick's story is inspiring and astonishing.  It reads like an addition to the Book of Acts in the Bible.<br />Patrick was born in Britain in the late fourth century to an aristocratic family.  Irish marauders kidnapped him from his home when he was 15 years old and took him as a slave to Ireland.  He labored endlessly for six years before escaping and returning to Britain and his family.<br />Patrick had atheistic beliefs when kidnapped, but during the course of his slavery he was transformed into a devout Christian, burning with love for Christ.  After several years of religious study, Patrick willingly journeyed back to Ireland on a mission to share the message of salvation with a godless people known for their barbarianism and paganism which he had experienced first hand.<br />Freeman tells the story of Patrick's life from information garnered from the two writings left by Patrick.  These are two letters Patrick wrote from Ireland to Britain that relate significant events of his ministry and life in simple, honest language.  Freeman also references other historical texts and archeological discoveries to explain the culture of Patrick's world.<br />Freeman displays his expertise in Irish history by offering the reader a comprehensive picture of the cultures in which Patrick lived.  Freeman is a professor of Classics at Washington University in St. Louis and earned his Ph. D. in Classical Philology and Celtic Studies from Harvard University.  His expertise in Irish history is apparent by his writing.  He adroitly fills in many of the blanks concerning Patrick's life.<br />This biography illustrates the ordeals and sufferings of Patrick while a slave and while a missionary in Ireland, as well as highlighting his amazing accomplishments.  At every turn Patrick faced opposition from Satan and from men.  Freeman's writing reveals Patrick's closeness to God by emphasizing portions of Patrick's two letters that Freeman interpreted and included in full in this book.<br />Through Patrick's own words, we see his enthusiasm and love for the Irish.  His words are reminiscent of Paul's writings to the Thessalonians and Philippians.  They are the words of a shepherd about and to his sheep.<br />In his letter of confession, Patrick writes of his compulsion to preach to the Irish, \\"I must proclaim my good news, I must pay God back in some way for all that he has done for me here on earth and what he will do in eternity-blessings no one can even imagine...The love of Christ carried me here to be a help to these people for the rest of my life.\\"<br />Freeman's biography of Patrick tells a story of transformation-the transformation of a selfish boy to a Christian man and the transformation of a pagan people to a people brimming with love for Christ.  This story will change your perspective of the Christian life and will give you a reason to celebrate St. Patrick's Day as a day of devotion to God.adroitly fills in many of the blanks concerning Patrick's life.<br />This biography illustrates the ordeals and sufferings of Patrick while a slave and while a missionary in Ireland, as well as highlighting his amazing accomplishments.

His story consists of all of the ingredients that I think readers desire in fiction.  He writes eloquently, even exquisitely at times.  He uses imagery and descriptions that will make you stop to re-read lines several times to savor them.  He superbly develops diverse characters: a southern-black couple--the man a Vietnam War Veteran, a Wyoming newspaper editor, a Vietnam Veteran freelance writer/loner, a Vietnamese woman, an ex Vietcong soldier, Buddhist monks, and an American soldier searching for a connection to God-all true to life, dead-on accurate portrayals.<br />The story is about war, life, death, redemption, reconciliation, remembering and relationships with God and others.  McAuliffe skillfully crafts the events so that they stir the reader's imagination and lead to variable interpretations and insights.  He doesn't just tell a story; he presents episodes of life, drawing the reader into the circumstances.  As he was a soldier and chaplain in the war, he writes with the experience of action and the wisdom of a spiritual mentor.<br />This book succeeds at combining fiction with spirituality, something many books try and fail to do.  Although shorter in length, Purple Sun is written in the classic tradition of Les Miserables by Hugo and Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky, and A Farewell to Arms by Hemingway, and it reminds me of A Separate Peace by John Knowles, also a story focusing on relationships before a backdrop of war.<br />As soon as I finished it, I thought of several people to share it with right away.  I think you will appreciate the author's honest, humble approach to writing about serious issues without being overly serious.  This book will definitely speak to you; only you can find out what it will say to you.	2004-04-21

His story offers many insights about the details of this war, including the tragedies.<br />It is also a personal tale of his life, his struggles with addiction and struggles in his family and with friends.<br />This book really does not fit into a particular category except the 5 star category.	2004-04-19

Don't Waste Your Life targets Christians desiring to live a meaningful life that produces lasting fruit.<br /> Piper is a prodigious Christian writer who has authored more than twenty books.  He pastors Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis.  I have read several of his books, and he continually offers solid, refreshing Christian teaching.<br /> In Don't Waste Your Life, Piper tells the reader about his personal discovery of the single passion worth pursuing in life.  He writes, \\"It was not always plain to me that pursuing God's glory would be virtually the same as pursuing my joy.  Now I see that millions of people waste their lives because they think these paths are two and not one.\\"<br /> He describes a typical married couple working through life to accumulate wealth so that they can retire and leisurely collect seashells in Florida.  He calls this course of life a waste.  Any life that treasures anything above Christ is a tragedy, writes Piper.<br /> According to Piper, we were created for more than merely providing for a family and trying to live a good life.  For Christians, Piper writes of a cause that is paramount to all others.<br /> He encourages us to consider the cause of Christ, the greatest king who ever lived.  He writes, \\"The greatest cause in the world is joyfully rescuing people from hell, meeting their earthly needs, making them glad in God, and doing it with a kind, serious pleasure that makes Christ look like the treasure he is.\\"<br /> Piper avoids rules, formulas and steps to living a fruitful live.  He proposes becoming single-minded in possessing a passion for Christ and for glorifying him above all else in our lives.  As we do this continually, we are sure to live satisfying, fruitful lives, says Piper.<br /> Piper accomplishes more than covering the basics of living the Christian life.  Using personal stories, quotes from other writers, and many scriptures, he emphasizes the values of Christ and his calling upon our lives.<br /> Piper summarizes his view of Christ's calling upon our lives, \\"God seldom calls us to an easier life, but always calls us to know more of him and drink more deeply of his sustaining grace.\\"<br /> The book consists of ten chapters with each chapter having several sections.  A theme that runs through the book is the virtue of taking risks in life for the glory of Christ.  Piper emphasizes courage as characteristic to the Christian-courage to take steps of faith, to risk losing life to gain glory for the name of Jesus.<br /> He writes, \\"There can be no weary resignation, no cowardly retreat, and no merciless contentment among Christ's people while he is disowned among thousands of unreached peoples.\\"<br /> Piper calls Christians to arms in a battle that we can join no matter who we are or where we are.  We can advance Christ's kingdom in the workplace or on the missions field.  If we become passionate about living for Him, we will experience his passionate joy and avoid wasting our lives.<br /> Don't Waste Your Life succeeds in creating passion and purpose in the reader.

A problem I had is that he never (that I can remember) defines the soul or discusses the spirit.  So, much of the language about the soul is somewhat ambiguous.  I think at times he referred to what I consider the spirit as the soul.  I never grasped exactly what he means by &quot;soul,&quot; which is frustrating when that is the focus of the book.<br />Much of the book lacked the passion that really moves a reader to wake up to the sense of soul and spirituality and the need to address the unseen world.  The book is told/read without much drama.<br />Keenan does share insights about life that will probably cause you to examine your priorities and direction in life.  He shares stories that are relevant but that didn't seem to strike a loud enough chord to me.  I think he could have gone deeper into his spiritual well to offer the reader more living water that what is here.<br />I think there is a lack of specificity about what he truly believes regarding the soul.  He doesn't share much of his Catholic belief system but more of a watered down spirituality that ignores much of what one would expect a Catholic priest to believe.<br />There were some nuggets that I can take with me such as looking for the miracle in everyday life, expecting gifts from God and from life, and trusting in the guidance of providence when least suspected.<br />I would encourage him to be more earnest about what he believes in the future.	2004-03-16

It unfortunately does not offer any character development of the main characters. We never learn much about them at all, little background or relationship information.  Once you read the first page; it takes off from there on a fast-paced at time frantic tale.<br />The story is based on a historical conspiracy theory that the author takes seriously but that lacks ALL credible evidence. For each assertion, there a hundreds of valid refutations that immediately jump out. The author is making a case that is so outlandish it is beyond being debatable.<br />I did enjoy reading it but had to completely ignore many of the claims made regarding art, history, religion and secret societies due to their lack of credibility.<br />I am really surprised that a book based on such erroneous and illogical claims could have been published at all and then be so popular.<br />If anyone actually is swayed by the story's claims, just look at The Case for Christ by Lee Strobel or especially Josh McDowell's Evidence that Demands a Verdict, among other Christian books that offer evidence for all aspects of Christianity. They offer historical, spiritual, religious, and scientific evidence of the verity of Christianity, as opposed to this book's conspiracy theories.<br />The truth concerning the issues relating to Jesus' life in this book are not mysteries as they are treated here. There has been more research and study of Jesus' life than anyone else in history. If the validity of his story and of the Bible was so ambiguous, neither would have stood against all the opposition to them both. Something built on lies and fraud cannot withstand the violent attacks levied against the early Christians.<br />Besides, this book purports that Constantine initiated a great fraud that caused the Catholic Church and Christianity to be based on lies. Well Christianity was already 300 years old by that time, and the Catholic church is not synomous with Christianity. The author doesn't even address the initial growth of Christianity in the centuries immediately following the life of Christ.

Through the revolution to reconstrucion, Jakes weaves the story of their lives through the historical events of the city, state and nation.  He does a mediocre job at retelling the historical events which lend themselves to storytelling, and he does a poor job of creating an interesting cast of characters.  None of them are very likable or well developed and they come and go quickly in flashes, so we don't really get to know any of them but the main character Alexandra Bell who I found to be uninteresting and annoying.<br />Since I live in Charleston, I am interested in learning more about the history of it, but this novel did not deliver much insight.  The history lesson of the novel seems elementary and offers little enlightenment.<br />I fought the urge to quit this book several times due to its droll nature.  Jakes gets rid of several characters by killing them off...eaten by an alligator, killed by falling off a horse due to the ice on a bridge (a rare event in sunny Carolina), killed by a falling tree during a hurricane, burned to death by knocking over a lantern, murdered by an angry slave, a freeman murdered by angry whites, small pox, attacked by a swarm of bees...way too contrived and unlikely. <br />I don't think Jakes applied himself too well to this novel and it shows.

Unfortunately, Jakes delivers a drawn out and at times boring tale of unappealing characters.<br />The novel follows three generations of the Bell family from Charleston, SC.  Through the revolution to reconstrucion, Jakes weaves the story of their lives through the historical events of the city, state and nation.  He does a mediocre job at retelling the historical events which lend themselves to storytelling, and he does a poor job of creating an interesting cast of characters.  None of them are very likable or well developed and they come and go quickly in flashes, so we don't really get to know any of them but the main character Alexandra Bell who I found to be uninteresting and annoying.<br />Since I live in Charleston, I am interested in learning more about the history of it, but this novel did not deliver much insight.  The history lesson of the novel seems elementary and offers little enlightenment.<br />I fought the urge to quit this book several times due to its droll nature.  Jakes gets rid of several characters by killing them off...eaten by an alligator, killed by falling off a horse due to the ice on a bridge (a rare event in sunny Carolina), killed by a falling tree during a hurricane, burned to death by knocking over a lantern, murdered by an angry slave, a freeman murdered by angry whites, small pox, attacked by a swarm of bees,poisoned by killer iced tea...way too contrived and unlikely.<br />I don't think Jakes applied himself too well to this novel and it shows.  I am disappointed in it.	2004-03-05

This is the experience of Eddie, the 83-year old widower who dies and goes to heaven in the Five People You Meet in Heaven.  At the time of his death, Eddie is a \\"squat, white-haired old man, with a short neck, a barrel chest, thick forearms, and a faded army tattoo on his right shoulder.\\"<br />Albom introduces us to Eddie and informs the reader that he is about to die.  Eddie is in charge of maintenance at the Ruby Pier amusement park.  He spends his days, as he has spent most of his adult life since coming home injured from World War II, making sure the rides run safely for the many visitors to the park.  After a brief countdown of events in the beginning of the book, Eddie is killed by a broken ride after rescuing a little girl from certain death.<br />We then learn about Eddie from three separate narratives.  One is the story of Eddie in heaven meeting the five people God has chosen to help him understand his life.  Interspersed throughout these scenes are flashbacks to several of Eddie's birthdays during his life that reveal his interactions with family and friends.  Albom also takes us to events from Eddie's life that are associated with the five people he meets.  Meanwhile, we see the events that follow Eddie's death at the amusement park.<br />The first person Eddie meets in heaven describes the roles of the five people he will meet, \\"Each of us was in your life for a reason.  You may not have known the reason at the time, and that is what heaven is for.  For understanding your life on earth.\\"<br />In helping the reader understand Eddie's life on earth, Albom presents a spiritual story but avoids religious or theological issues.  This story centers on the afterlife and on relationships we develop during the course of our lives.  The condensed message of the story is that each person's life matters, even when one is ignorant of his or her impact on others.<br />Eddie views his life as having been wasted and of little significance to anyone.  What he learns in heaven is the opposite.  During his life, he suffered several tragedies that have caused him to overlook the contributions he was making to those around him.  He looks at his war experience as having been particularly detrimental to the rest of his life.  In heaven, his Captain from World War II and a little girl show him the truth about what happened in the jungle of the Philippines during the war.<br />Albom succeeds in writing an entertaining, imaginative narrative that provides a positive, inspiring message.  The message, however, lacks spiritual insight and is narrow.  It fails to address many of the issues that a story about heaven causes to arise.  For example, God plays only a distant role in Eddie's experience in heaven, and Albom does not address good and evil.  His version of heaven is pure fantasy.<br />The five people Eddie meets challenge him to accept his life and himself so that he might enjoy peace and contentment in heaven.<br />I think most readers will find the Five People You Meet in Heaven entertaining and thought provoking but will gain little insight from it.  The story should be read as what it is--an imaginative, enjoyable fable based on the author's fantasy rather than on any theology about heaven.her impact on others.<br />Eddie views his life as having been wasted and of little significance to anyone.

This is the claim that historian Stephen Prothero explores in his remarkable new book American Jesus: How the Son of God Became a National Icon.<br />Prothero, Chairman of the religious department at Boston University, takes an historian's approach to the dynamic relationship between Americans and Jesus during the past three centuries.  Prothero writes, \\"Jesus may be `the same yesterday and today and forever' (Heb 13:8), but American depictions of him have varied widely from age to age and community to community.\\"<br />He takes the reader through the stages of Americans' transforming view of Jesus--not the \\"historical Jesus\\" or \\"living Christ\\" but the Jesus of American culture.  Prothero offers an enlightening and encyclopedic tale of how Americans' image of Jesus has been effected by popular writings, artwork, preachers, church movements and even political figures.  There is much fodder for Prothero to dissect as he notes the Library of Congress holds 17,000 books about Jesus, twice as much as the second most popular subject (Shakespeare).<br />He artfully shows how generations of devoted Christians have emphasized different character attributes of Jesus such as his role as ultimate judge, his feminine, motherly qualities, his manliness, love or friendliness.<br />Prothero focuses on several books and artworks of the 20th century that emphasized Jesus' manly qualities in response to the ubiquitous feminine likenesses of Jesus from the preceding century.  These rugged representations of Jesus led to the view of him as a \\"man's man\\" who could excel in church, business and war.  The popular cultural image of Jesus then evolved into the \\"hippie Jesus\\" of the Jesus freaks who took Jesus with them as they hitchhiked and sang across the country during the sixties and seventies. Prothero discusses how in the late seventies, Ralph Kozak's Jesus Laughing portrait spread the image of a joyful savior for the first time and opened the doors to a seeker-friendly church environment void of the gloom and doom messages of sin and hell.<br />The history lesson illustrates that not just Christians have related to Jesus in America and influenced this cultural icon.  Prothero closely examines the images of Jesus among Jews, Hindus, Buddhists and black leaders of the civil rights era.  Prothero's writing reveals the tension among American Jewish leaders regarding Jesus' Jewish heritage and how Hindu leaders have reverenced Jesus over the last century.<br />American Jesus also follows the history of the Mormon Church as it has progressed from the eastern shores through the Midwest and to Utah before expanding throughout the country.  Prothero offers an educational assessment of how Mormon leaders have also transformed their view of Jesus since its inception, so that now they see themselves as being a church of Jesus that has disavowed many of its controversial peculiarities from a century ago.<br />This book shows how people allow their own needs and personalities, as well as popular culture, to inform their perceptions of Jesus.  Prothero tells us that in this country the sacred and the secular are inextricably intertwined and religious people continually try to find the balance between the two.<br />Readers will find that American Jesus is a well-researched, provocative account of Jesus' place in America.  Prothero closes by anticipating a new American debate about Jesus as Mel Gibson's movie The Passion promises to raise new awareness of Jesus.  By Prothero's account, it will not create the first American controversy generated from images of Jesus in popular art and culture.k Jesus with them as they hitchhiked and sang across the country during the sixties and seventies.

I learned much more about life and history and enjoyed all of it.  Hillerman comes across as the salt of the earth, a young boy from rural Oklahoma who was truly without guile.  He describes growing up in a small town and then being drafted and shipped off to war.<br />I especially enjoyed his telling of his time as an infantryman during WWII.  I have read WWII accounts by officers like Patton but never by a grunt. It was a new and enlightening perspective that I appreciated.<br />It is always interesting to see/read how successful people become a success in their chosen fields, and Hillerman's account is interesting.  In it he shares much history of the southwest.<br />He does not share about writing his novels until he is well into his memoir.  This is the story of his life and not just about writing.  He eventually does share how he made the leap from journalist and college professor to novelist.<br />This is a lighthearted tale of the life of a truly American writer.  It requires patience and rewards it with an honest, entertaining story.	2004-02-08

I wanted to learn how I can help her grow up strong and able to fend for herself and not become a victim of any sorts.<br />For the most part this book was a revelation to me about the reality women face...a reality of danger, threats, bullying, discrimination, etc.  It made me put myself in the shoes of the women walking to her car in a dark parking lot who fears for her safety and life due to potential dangers.  Ms. Snortland shows how fear is often present in daily situations women encounter.<br />She also indicates changes in attitude and lessons in defense that can improve a women's posture in the world.  It has encouraged me to sign my daughter up for self-defense classes as soon as it is age-appropriate.  I garnered a much better understanding of many societal attitudes my daughter will face as she grows up.  It will really help me be a better father to her.<br />A downside to this book is Snortland's political advocacy.  It is clear where she stands politically and on certain issues she conveys the message that women who disagree are being duped by a male-dominated society. To me this is a totally different issue than what the book purports to focus on.  She should stick to defending women not politics.<br />The above criticism aside, the book is worthwhile for its main message and was helpful.	2004-01-28

The knowledge he shares about dangerous people is priceless, as is what he shares about listening to our own intuition that warns us of danger.  The examples he shares in the book drive the points home.<br />This book has helped me to become a wiser more prudent person, father and husband.

It is about protecting children from the many dangers that face them.<br />Thank You Mr. De Becker.	2004-01-28

This book, in addition to being a book I couldn't put down, focuses on deeply philosophical and even spiritual issues that strike the heart of human behavior and responsibility.<br />The only shortcoming in this book is the role of a religious-zealot-wacko who plays a prominent part.  Although probably a realistic type of character, I just was not able to logically connect his mission and what would motivate him to kidnap a scientist.  It seems incongruent that such a zealot would ever consider little knows scientific evidence to actually threaten his empire of mind numb followers.<br />Otherwise, the characters are interesting and the story creative and intelligent.

The several children in the story offer a spectrum of personalities and clash and interact entertainingly.  The story is full of wit and insight into human behavior, especially the love between mother and children.<br />I have given this book and its sequels as gifts to the delight of several friends.

Shakespeare writes that &quot;there is a divinity that shapes our ends, rough hew them how we will.&quot; (Hamlet)  This book expands on the theme of allowing providence to shape our ends and trusting in the wisdom of providence.<br />Taken on its own, this book may inspire some readers to be passive regarding life's outcomes, as other reviewers have suggested, but we read this in light of so much contemporary preaching and Christian writing about being proactice and successful and prosperous and &quot;blessed&quot; in all we decide to do that reading this book gives us a different view that will provide balance to our spiritual lives.  It is a view of contentment at the feet of God, a view of trusting in God's presence and compassion.  I was thrilled while reading this book.  It is a book to inspire us all to sit at Jesus' feet and listen to him, as Mary did, rather than asking Jesus to bless our busyness from a distance.<br />One must remember that this is a book of compiled letters to nuns and notes for lectures to a similar audience.  These are exhortations to nuns who have devoted their lives to Christ.  The casual Christian may find the exhortations extreme and that they do not fit into our Christian America mindset.  The structure of the book does create a more laborious read than modern books that flow better due to proper formatting.<br />I recommend this book as I recommend Imitation of Christ by Thomas a'Kempis.  They are books that are relevant and I think necessary to modern Christians, especially those caught up in the &quot;Purpose-Driven Life&quot; movement.  I bought a copy for my pastor to read, because we plainly do not hear of this kind of devotion today.  It is not a movement but a sacrificial life the author promotes.	2004-01-22

This book shows that his success came after grueling hours, sacrifice and many failures.  It shows the lifestyle of a famous and prolific writer.

She provides solid instruction about several things the writer needs to check before submitting a book for review.<br />Overall, I found this to be a wise, general teaching tool for me.  It also gave me some other resources to read.<br />I agree with a previous reviewer that there are peculiarities in the Christian fiction market that are frustrating, such as what I would consider the lack of realistic stories.  Ms. Stokes discusses the type of Christian novel that is published and it is a conservative, evangelical book for the most part.  Christian publishers may avoid a book that presents a different view of Christians from what they think is congruent with readers' values.  Essentially, Ms. Stokes lets us know that there is a precise type of Christian fiction that most of the Christian publishers are looking for.<br />If you are trying to write and publish Christian fiction, this is a good learning tool for you.

This book is a literary masterpiece that sets a bar for terror that is yet to be surpassed.<br />I was very impressed by the writing skill of Shelley.  She does a terrific job telling this story, using three narrators that offer different points of view and voices.<br />The monster is a character that elicited sympathy, respect, anger and hatred.  He is intelligent and articulate in a way I did not expect.  His ability to convey emotions and thoughts creates mixed emotions about him.  Yet, because his hatred and anger prevail, these emotions prevailed in me too in my regards of him.<br />Shelley shows the danger of allowing one's ambitions to overtake balance and reason.  We see the character of Dr. Frankenstein forsake all to see this dream of creating life realized.  We see the consequences of his actions that are a warning to us to tread more cautiously regarding our ambitions.<br />All of the characters are developed comprehensively.<br />I enjoyed reading this but had to set it aside at times because of the tragedy it entails.  You know where the story is headed but still hold out some hope that it will turn out more positively--like watching Titanic, you know it is going to sink but still hope maybe it won't.<br />I think this is a timeless classic you should read.	2004-01-19

It was not at all what I had expected based on my exposure to Frankenstein movies and tales.  This story is quite different in many ways that make it more appealing to the reader.<br />The tale involves a monster that is truly hideous in form but reveals a conflicted mind and heart.  Shelley effectively causes the reader to have mixed feelings about this creature that wields destruction while confessing its own misery and affection for humanity.<br />She also conveys the dangers of a person pursuing his or her ambition at the cost of other values such as relationships and peace.  <br />The novel is told in an innovative fashion.  Shelley uses three different narrators to tell the story.  This creates some variety in the point of view and in the voice of the narrator.  <br />This book is very compelling, but at times I had to put it down due to the tragedy of it.  The whole time you know where its events are leading and a part of you wants to go there and another part wants to avoid it--like watching Titanic, you know it is going to sink but you still hold out some hope it won't and you try to avoid its definitive demise.<br />I think this is a horror story that has yet to be surpassed in literature.  I really felt for the characters, including the monster. I was completely entertained by the skillful writing.	2004-01-18

Unfortunately, it is a laborious read, except for portions where the author just writes the story without any tangents and unnecessary stream of consciousness episodes that serve no purpose. There is too much telling of irrelevant details and thoughts and too little showing the reader entertaining action. The action that does occur in the book is intriguing--the ship sinking, Pi and some animals in the lifeboat, their subsequent interactions, and his quest for survival. There is a plethora of opportunity here to better captivate the reader, but the writer attempts to stimulate us with droll talk of religion and mundane information.<br />The book ends with attempts at profundities but just left me wondering what it was all about.

Losing Summer is refreshingly well written and succeeds at captivating the reader with its intrigue and suspense.<br />What stands out most to me about it is that it reads like a memoir. I felt like the main character, Daniel, is a real person telling his story. Gantt excels in character development. When the book is done, you will have become a personal acquaintance to the main characters.<br />The story is right out of our culture with young adults living life to the hilt. They experience a sudden halt to their exuberance when one of their own takes her own life. Her three friends are left wondering why. So are her wealthy, prominent father and the police.<br />The tale leads the narrator-Daniel and the reader through a labyrinthine tunnel that may or may not have a light at its end.<br />This book is unlike any other novel I have read due to its bold, in-your-face writing that turns out to be a welcome change from so many of the recent novels I have read. Gantt makes a real investment in his characters, and I think they offer a great return.<br />Before you read this book, make sure you have plenty of time set aside and do not have to get up early the next morning, because you will not be able to put it down once you start it.	2004-01-16

He also knows that we would all like to believe that all paths lead to God, no matter what we call him/her, and we can all find him/her and the truth in ourselves and experience enlightenment by disciplining our thoughts.  It reminds me of the Celestine Prophecies, another book I found to be based on inane ideas and consisting of poor writing.  I think you will feel the same about this book as you did that one, which was also very popular.  Throw Deepak Chopra in the same group.  This book is similar to his \\"insights\\" on knowing God.<br />The audiotape is read by the author who just plain sounds goofy.<br />This book should land under the humor section.  Tolle's idea of enlightenment is nothing new.  He pales in comparison to scriptures, classic philosophy and literature and even to modern motivational writers like Zig Ziglar, Rober Schuller, Norman Vincent Peale, John Maxwell, Anthony Robbins, Robert Collier, Thomas Merton, Og Mandino, etc.  Their writing is head and shoulders above this drivel.  Keep this book in the context of centuries of spiritual writing that the author disparages based on his personal \\"enlightenment.\\"	2004-01-14

Unfortunately, it is a laborious read, except for portions where the author just writes the story without any tangents and unnecessary stream of consciousness episodes that serve no purpose.  There is too much telling of irrelevant details and thoughts and too little showing the reader entertaining action.  The action that does occur in the book is intriguing--the ship sinking, Pi and some animals in the lifeboat, their subsequent interactions, and his quest for survival.  There is a plethora of opportunity here to write more creatively, but the writer attempts to stimulate us with droll talk of religion and mundane information.<br />The book ends with attempts at profundities but just left me wondering what it was all about.

His client list includes some of the top music and Hollywood celebrities and professional athletes.  Dr. Grandison is talented, handsome and anointed to counsel people and to bring healing to their lives.  His conflict stems from whether to follow his ambition to be the star of his own television show or to follow his spirit's leading to direct a low-profile ministry at his family's church and avoid the limelight.  On each side of the turmoil is a lovely woman hoping he will see things her way.<br />Dr. Grandison is the central character.  He enjoys a simple life and desires to have children, but his wife presses him to reach for more of the spoils of success in the world.  She urges him to delay parenthood in order to reach his full potential in his career.  After his wife dies in a car accident, Dr. Grandison finds that two paths diverge before him, and if he chooses wrongly, he may lose all he has gained.<br />In Mercy, Mercy Me, Ronn Elmore writes about what he knows.  Like the main character, the author is a Psychologist and a minister.  His expertise on personal growth and relationship issues is apparent in this novel that addresses the tensions present in relationships between men and women.<br />The story of Mercy, Mercy Me is built on the relationships between the main characters.  Dr. Elmore does an excellent job at developing the characters, so that the reader can identify with them and their desires, dreams, fears and temptations.<br />The reader also will identify with the challenge of being in the world but not of it that the Christian characters face in this novel.  Dr. Elmore impresses me with his skill in creating realistic Christian characters.  He adroitly shows how sincere Christians can stray from the straight and narrow path by deceptive traps and their own worldly desires.<br />In the beginning of this book, the first 20 pages or so, Dr. Elmore tries to say too much about the story and the characters.  I found the initial chapters cumbersome to read; however, before I knew it, the book really started to flow.  It is as if Dr. Elmore started off cold but quickly found his zone and got hot just like an athlete that suddenly breaks out of a slump and starts playing at the top of his game.<br />This novel touches on many challenges that Christians face today while trying to serve God such as marriage conflicts, greed, selfish ambition, sex, sickness, betrayal, time management, parenting and wolves in sheep's clothing.  Dr. Elmore expertly addresses these subjects and more in a very entertaining Christian novel that I think you will enjoy.desires.<br />In the beginning of this book, the first 20 pages or so, Dr. Elmore tries to say too much about the story and the characters.

He writes eloquently while providing the reader with an action-packed story.  I bought Wild Justice off the new paperback shelf and was disappointed to get home and see that it was actually written in 1979.  I thought because it is a thriller that deals with terrorism, intrigue and military special operations that it would be dated, but I was impressed at how prescient Smith was when writing this book.  The plot could be set in 2003 with only minor changes.  The organizational conflicts and terrorist strategies are accurate and insightful.  The date of the writing does not lessen the book's impact and effect at all.<br />As far as the story, it has everything a thriller needs and more.  Secretive terrorists, special forces, good and evil and gray areas.  It has a very well-written romance.  It has crises of conscience and morals.<br />This sounds cliche but I could not put it down over the four days  it took me to read it.  I felt good about the ending, too.  I have not yet been disappointed by Smith's book, which is great because he has written about 30.	2003-12-18

I can't think of any person who, after reading this book, would not in some way become a better person.  Antoine Fisher is a hero, a mentor and an excellent writer and story teller.<br />His story is as sad as a story can be at times.  His childhood is utterly tragic and shows the evils of humanity and the shortcomings of our culture and society.  Yet, throughout his misery, he maintains an inner spark that drives him through the trials he faces, one obstacle after another.  This is a story of a beautiful human spirit overcoming everything thrown against it--selfish, abusive people, a system that doesn't care, anger and bitterness, violence and apathy.<br />Finding Fish tells how a lost soul became found and flourished.  It shows how the love of people can make a difference in a life.  It also shows what does really matter in the end.<br />I think Finding Fish should be required reading for all people.  I am thankful to Antoine Fisher for sharing his story.<br />The movie was good, but it does not do the true story justice--there is just too much there to put into a 2 hour movie--so read the book.	2003-12-09

His tales of trying to learn and speak French are too funny.<br />It is hard to explain why this book is so funny, but it definitely is.	2003-12-09

Books	4	22	23	N	N	An intelligently written, stimulating defense of the gospel	Are you one of the many people searching for more signs of heaven here on earth?  In Rumors of Another World, Philip Yancey, the prolific writer of Christian non-fiction, aims to help readers grasp the reality of the heavenly kingdom ruled by God.<br /><br />Yancey offers a contemplative, intelligently written commentary of the tensions between the spiritual and the physical, heaven and earth, good and evil, the seen and the unseen, and faith and unbelief.  The book flows steadily as Yancey cogently addresses topics that fall into three main categories: 1) What are We Missing? 2) Signs of Disorder, and 3) Two Worlds.<br />According to Yancey's note, he writes this book for people who live in the borderlands between belief and doubt.  In the book, Yancey thinks aloud to answer questions such as \\"Is the visible world around us all there is?\\"<br />Yancey describes himself as being, at times, a \\"reluctant Christian, buffeted by doubts and `in recovery' from bad church encounters.\\"  For himself and the readers, he explains why he believes in Jesus and the invisible spiritual realm.<br />I have not read a contemporary Christian writer that incorporates such a plethora of references as Yancey does in this book.  Highlights include quotes by C.S. Lewis, Thomas Merton, Milton, T.S. Eliot, Einstein, William James, Blaise Pascal, and many more poets, philosophers, authors and saints.<br />Perhaps the most effective reference covers several pages devoted to the story of John Merrick, the Elephant Man.  Yancey discusses Ashley Montagu's poignant book, The Elephant Man, illustrating how Merrick remained a gentle, compassionate human despite the brutal treatment he received at the hands of most of the people he encountered during his brief life.  Yancey uses the story to show how heaven reveals itself in the most unusual places, where we least expect to witness the divine.  Yancey emphasizes other points by interspersing similar analogies throughout the book.<br />Yancey draws on his experiences in nature from around the globe, his interactions with people in the United States and other countries, and his positive and negative interactions in churches.  These stories combined with the many references serve to elucidate Christian perspectives on day-to-day activities and on spiritual conundrums.  One of the most intriguing chapters compares the world's versus the Christian's attitude toward sex, and another looks at the conflicting ideas of the \\"good life.\\"<br />Although the book fails to deliver a crescendo, it coherently provides logical reasons to believe in the substance of the Christian worldview and, most importantly, in the presence of a loving and caring God.<br />I think Yancey's writing is a gift to modern readers so that we might see past the titillating distractions of our world to the eternal spiritual realm.  Yancey draws from many impressive thinkers to articulate a persuasive defense of the gospel.

The author's investigation about his family's history of owning slaves spares no facts, however disturbing they are.  It traces the history of the slave trade and focuses on the slave business of Charleston, SC where his family settled and started several plantations where many slaves lived and worked.  He finishes his exploration by describing his presence at the family reunion of his family's slaves' ancestors.  This book explains the plights of slaves and slaveowners without any slant caused by some political agenda.  It is a straightforward presentation of slavery and its consequences.  The evils of slavery become apparent by the mere description of history.<br />Ball meanders at some times in ways that may not be interesting to some readers; however, I appreciated some of the details about the history of South Carolina and its environment.<br />I think this book accomplishes a healing and educational purpose that trancends Ball's family and reaches to all Americans, as we have all been affected negatively by the heritage of slavery in this country.	2003-12-07

Plath's poetic skill comes shining through in this novel about a young woman suffering from severe depression and suicidal ideation.  Plath's use of words to convey images, feelings, thoughts and personality is precise.  The story flows beautifully, as she tells the story of Esther Greenwood.<br />Esther's fall into depression reveals in depth insights into the malady that come from Plath's own experiences.  This brings up an issue when reading this book.  It is difficult to separate the character and the novel from the author and her own life and tragic ending.  That consistently loomed in the back of my mind as I read about E. Greenwood.<br />I enjoyed reading this, but also had to put it down at times because of the depressing nature of the story.  Plath puts the reader into the thoughts and consciousness of a depressed young woman, and that is not an uplifting experience.  I don't think this is the type of novel you just read for pleasure w/o becoming involved with the character.  Plath wants to make sure you know what it is like to be a depressed person thinking about suicide.<br />It has an optimistic ending that allows you to leave Esther Greenwood to take on the world again and to trust that she will do OK, even though the author fell victim to the depression that haunted her.	2003-11-26

This memoir focuses on his senior year at The Citadel, The Military College of SC-recently in the headlines for the losing battle to remain all-male.  It offers keen insights into his life through writing of the highest level.<br /><br />Conroy's tale follows his senior year but also delves into his life as it centers around his basketball and academic careers.  At the forefront of the scenes from his life is the maniacal behavior of his father, an abusive, sadistic marine who was a tortuous figure throughout Conroy's youth.<br /><br />I found the story of Conroy's development as a lover of books and as a writer extremely interesting.  One could even surmise that all the events of his life served as ingredients to making him a great novelist.<br /><br />One cannot help but to ride on the emotional rollercoaster that this book creates as it follows Conroy's ups and downs on and off the basketball court.  As he writes about specific games he played, it reads like the play-by-play to the NCAA championship game, which every game was to Conroy.<br /><br />The book offers great details about his relationships to other players and people in his life, including teachers, who made a lasting mark on him.<br /><br />As a Citadel graduate and athlete, I found the memoir to paint accurate illustrations of life as a Citadel athlete, trying to excel in a sport when everything seems to be against you-the school, the coach, the students-everything.<br /><br />I don't think any reader will be disappointed in this book.

It sat on my shelf for about 3 years before I finally became motivated to read it.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.  It is like no other book I have read, except maybe a Dickens novel.  Hugo indulges in such in depth character development that I felt like I personally knew all the characters involved.<br /><br />This is a story of grace, mercy, redemption, virture and vanity.  Hugo leads the reader on a spiritual journey of self-discovery.  The journey includes illustrations of the best of humanity and the worst.  You see the image of how you want to live your life and also of those people you want to be nothing like and want to avoid at all costs.<br /><br />The only downside to the book was the extensive cultural and geographical descriptions that Hugo provides, but though they are strenuous when reading them, they make the action that follows more understandable and meaningful.<br /><br />This is an entertaining and moving story built on moving and meaningful plots and themes.<br /><br />To me, while on the shelf, it was large and intimidating, but as soon as I started page one, I felt like I was coming home to a significant awakening.<br /><br />I think every book lover should commit to reading this.  I bought the paperback and the Modern Libray hardcover of the Wilbour translation and reviewed both, and I chose to read the more classic Wilbour translation which I thought captured the traditional language better.  I think it is just a personal preference which version one likes--both tell the same story and are verbatim translations.<br /><br />Craig Stephans, author of [[ASIN:1594571465 Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays]]	2003-11-16

It follows the New York Times' Bestseller Mission Compromised as the second book in a three-book series.  (If you haven't read Mission Compromised yet, it is now out in paperback.)  In The Jericho Sanction, North continues the action-packed story of Peter Newman, a Marine lieutenant colonel whose covert operation against terrorists and Saddam Hussein was betrayed by United Nations' and U.S. government bureaucrats.<br /> Newman and his wife Rachel go into hiding following an assassination attempt orchestrated by a renegade UN Deputy Secretary General with KGB ties.  Although, he has been framed as an international terrorist, Newman is called out of hiding to help the US military find three soviet-era nuclear weapons that may have fallen into the hands of Saddam Hussein.<br /> When his wife is kidnapped in Israel, along with an Israeli woman, Newman teams up with the Israeli military to find them and the nuclear weapons.  The events that follow bring the middle-east to the brink of nuclear war, as Israel considers a proactive nuclear strike as its necessary action of defense.<br /> Like Mission Compromised, this book is a gripping story of international intrigue, conflict, violence, betrayal and faith.  It is an entertaining and intelligently written page-turner that the reader is sure to appreciate.<br /> As President Reagan's coordinator of US counter-terrorism efforts in the mid-1980's, North was involved in highly-classified covert operations, including the 1985 interception of the Achille Laura cruise ship hijackers and the bombing of Libyan terrorists' bases.<br /> As this novel was going through the finishing touches prior to publication, North was embedded with US Marines as they stormed Baghdad as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  He uses his first-hand knowledge of the region, the governments, conflicts, and of US military operations to write a realistic story about the war on terrorism.  This novel reveals the murderous hatred of terrorists and the faithful courage of the soldiers who oppose them.<br /> North said in an interview about the book that he spent significant time with the Israeli military in order to write accurately about it.  He also says that all of the descriptions of the equipment and weaponry in The Jericho Sanction (and there are several high-tech gadgets used in it) are all \\"dead-on accurate.\\"<br /> The action in this book is fast-paced and moves from scene to scene before you can blink your eyes.  It lacks in-depth character development, as the characters play their roles too neatly--exactly the way you would imagine without any surprises.  Even so, by reading this book, you become familiar with the caliber and commitment of those men and women of the Israeli, British, and US militaries who are unselfishly risking their lives to prevent more atrocities like the September 11th attack.<br /> The book ends with one of the three nuclear weapons missing, and the weapon may eventually find its way to the United States.  North offers a glimpse of the third and final book of the trilogy. He says that the upcoming book will be about the US capabilities to deal with the nuclear threat from terrorists and from countries like Iran that may already posses nuclear weapons.This novel reveals the murderous hatred of terrorists and the faithful courage of the soldiers who oppose them.<br /> North said in an interview about the book that he spent significant time with the Israeli military in order to write accurately about it.

It is about worshipping God and the attitude and posture of worship.<br /><br /> Worship music stands out as a key factor in church services today.  When we discuss churches, we ask about the praise and worship music--the songs, the band and singers.  We want to know how long praise and worship lasts, how loud it is, whether people dance, clap their hands or stand quietly.<br /><br /> In this book, Redman takes the focus of worship off the external issues listed above and focuses on the heart of the worshipper.  He guides the reader into the understanding that worship is not something Christians do only during a church service, but worship is what we do when we're alone, at work, or at play; worship is how we live our life before God.  This all sounds obvious, and maybe it is, but the book helped me by reminding me of some principles of worship and teaching new perspectives on worship.<br /><br /> Redman recites a story from his experience as a worship leader in his church.  The pastor and leaders of the church agreed that the congregation was missing the purpose of the worship time; they were becoming distracted by the environment and were failing to enter into God's presence.  The pastor decided to remove the music, the sound system, the band and worship leaders from the service for a season.<br /><br /> Redman writes that after initially being discouraged by the awkwardness of the change, \\"we soon began to learn how to bring heart offerings to God without any of the external trappings we'd grown used to.  By stripping everything away, we slowly started to rediscover the heart of worship.\\" (103)<br /><br /> From his reflection during that time, Redman wrote the song \\"Heart of Worship.\\"  The song indicates Redman's view that true worship pours from the worshipper's heart to the heart of Jesus.<br /><br /> The Unquenchable Worshipper does not delve into complex issues but attempts to lead the reader into an honest examination of his or her relationship with God.  I think it does this successfully by serving as a mirror to the reader's spiritual condition.<br /><br /> Most Christians participate in some form of worship of God, usually in church but also in private-maybe even in the car (I've seen some of you driving, and I know your singing along to worship music), but probably few of us regularly consider that we are called to live a life of worship.  This book teaches how to worship God more sincerely and passionately in everything we do.  It is an easy read; it's a small book with short colorful chapters addressing different characteristics of the kind of worshippers God desires.<br /><br /> I think it will challenge you to make adjustments in your life that will help you draw nearer to God and experience him more fully.

Since their creation, the Stations' focus on Christ has become intermixed with stories of piety or tradition not necessarily mentioned in the gospel accounts.<br /><br /> I have a 1925 Catholic Pocket Manual with the approved Stations of the Cross in it.  I have benefited from the eloquent way the Stations take the reader through the seminal events of Christ's suffering; however, I have also been frustrated by the elevation of Mary's stature in these Stations to one of similar footing as the Lord's.<br /><br /> In The New Stations of the Cross, McKenna bases her interpretation on the recent revisions to the Stations made by Pope John Paul II.  His substantial changes have been designed to bring the Stations into stronger congruence with the gospel accounts of Christ's passion.<br /><br />McKenna's writing is focused primarily on Jesus.  Other topics are interpreted in their relation to him and his suffering.<br />In addition to the traditional fourteen stations, McKenna completes the journey by adding a fifteenth station on the resurrection.<br /><br /> McKenna's writing demonstrates a tenderness and sympathy toward the suffering of Christ that is rarely conveyed in books.  She writes from the perspective of one who has spent considerable time studying the topics she addresses in each of the Stations.<br /><br /> The New Stations of the Cross serves as a guide to the Christian desiring to set aside superfluous dogma and focus on the singular chain of events of Christianity.<br /><br /> The writing is superb and attempts to paint the picture of Christ's suffering, so that the reader can see the impact of torture and pain on Christ.<br /><br /> The following is a sample taken from McKenna's writing on the Sixth Station in which Jesus is scourged and crowned with thorns, \\"The way becomes fraught with horror. Now Jesus is utterly alone and handed over simply to be tortured, terrified, made sport of as immediate preparation for his grisly and ghastly public execution...They will intentionally work on dehumanizing him, demeaning him, and instill in him a taste of what is to come, taking his dignity from him piece by piece, as they take pieces of his skin and make him bleed, inflicting pain for the sake of inflicting pain.\\"<br /><br /> McKenna brings the reader face to face with what Jesus endured and with the truly remarkable love and submission he exercised in his endurance.<br /><br /> In some of the chapters, McKenna may seem to digress from her focus on the biblical events as she discusses current issues as relating to the Station being discussed.  This reminds the reader that the suffering of Christ does not take place in an historical vacuum but is present today in the suffering of our time.<br /><br />When we sympathize with the suffering of Christ portrayed in this book and in the gospels, we are encouraged to see the suffering of Christ in the poor, oppressed, addicted and accused around us and not turn a cold shoulder to them.<br /><br /> The New Stations of the Cross is an excellent guide for individuals and groups desiring to look right into the heart of Christianity.<br />Craig Stephans, author of [[ASIN:1594571465 Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays]]he following is a sample taken from McKenna's writing on the Sixth Station in which Jesus is scourged and crowned with thorns, \\"The way becomes fraught with horror.

US	32693047	R14DBZDIQ85JJA	006055584X	972512365	Mission Compromised	Books	5	8	9	N	N	A pleasant surprise	For those of you who have an appetite for suspenseful and gripping novels written from a reality-based Christian perspective, you will want to indulge yourself with Mission Compromised.<br />Written by Oliver North and co-author Joe Musser, Mission Compromised takes the reader on a journey of intrigue, suspense, honor and betrayal.  It creates a roller-coaster ride of emotions for the reader.  North hits a home run with his first novel.  I was excited to find that it packs the punch of a first-class thriller.<br />Most readers probably have some familiarity with Lieutenant Colonel North, USMC retired.  You may know him as the radio talk show host, guest on TV talk shows, syndicated columnist, and the central figure in the Iran-Contra hearings during Presidents Reagan's administration.  North was the U.S. government's Counter-Terrorism Coordinator from 1983-1986.  His 22-year military career includes many exploits and awards.  He is also the author of two best-selling autobiographical books.<br />Mission Compromised, although a novel, possesses an autobiographical component for North.  In an interview about the book, North stated that interspersed throughout the novel are events and characters based on his actual experiences.  In fact, Oliver North is an important character in the book.  This historical aspect of the book makes it more believable for readers.<br />I felt many of the same emotions and had the same level of interest while reading this novel as I did while watching the movie Blackhawk Down.  North illustrates the courage and vulnerability of the soldiers in the book and puts a face on the leaders and citizens of the enemy country where they are engaged.  His book shows the decision-making processes of some of the political leaders and beauracrats that often pull the strings on military operations.<br />The title of the book summarizes its major plot: a covert military mission compromised by betrayal, greed and corruptness at the highest levels of government.  The central character is a highly-decorated U.S. Marine chosen to lead a strategic mission into the heart of the Middle East to hunt down and eliminate terrorist leaders.  The mission is jointly-sponsored by the United Nations, United States and Great Britain.<br />As the mission unfolds, North writes about the inner workings of Washington and international politics, as well as the military planning and implementation of a secret operation.  He provides details that only someone with his level of government and military experience would be able to relate.<br />The military and political action of the book is balanced by a love story of redemption and faithfulness between husband and wife.<br />Throughout the events of the novel, North adds believable and relevant Christian dialogue and interaction.  He doesn't disrupt the flow of action or the integrity of the characters' development to include a salvation message.  His inclusion of the Christian message is seamless within the fabric of the book.<br />Mission Compromised is the first of a three-book series.  This means that not everything is wrapped up by the end of the book.  It also means that there are two more books to look forward to reading.  Despite being book one of three, Mission Compromised does have a definite conclusion and epilogue, so it doesn't leave the reader hanging; however, it does leave the reader with a hunger for more to read.  I hope the second book will be out soon.nt.

Manning drives the point home that we are loved unconditionally and enormously by God.  He emphasizes that we are loved as we are today with all of our weaknesses, imperfections and mistakes.  He writes that what gives God pleasure more than anything in creation is a believer trusting that he or she is loved.<br /><br />Manning's thrust encourages the reader to experience the presence of the Lord in the present.  He affirms to us that we do not need to worry about the past or fret the future because our Soul's Sufficiency is with us in the now.<br /><br /> One of the obstacles to trusting God that people face, says Manning, is that we have a distorted perception of God.  In this book, he presents a true image of the welcoming, gentle God who died on the cross to be with us.<br /><br />Manning attacks some of the false images of God that have been presented by the religious over the years.  At one point in the book, he summarizes his belief regarding this distortion of God's image:<br /><br />Thirty-seven years of pastoral experience with Catholics, mainline Protestants, evangelicals, fundamentalists, Seventh Day Adventists, blacks, whites, Asians, and Hispanics tell me unmistakably that many a believer's perception of God is radically wrong. (72)<br /><br />Manning effectively leads the reader to comprehension of a true image of our God.  The God Manning writes about draws us into his presence daily with love and kindness.<br /><br /> Another problem that Manning addresses is the plague of low self-esteem among Christians.  He argues that low self-esteem keeps Christians wallowing in guilt and shame and prevents the full acceptance of Christ's redemption.  Manning also decries the tone of low self-esteem and insecurity that often underlies religious messages.  He shares how such messages condemn listeners and push them from intimacy with the Lord:<br /><br />From personal experience I can testify that the language of low self-esteem is harsh and demanding; it abuses, accuses, rejects, finds fault, blames, condemns, reproaches, and scolds in a monologue of impatience and chastisement. (16)<br /><br />Unfortunately, many Christians, like Manning, have been the object of such assaults that lead to self-analysis and doubt in our righteousness in Christ.  Manning writes that such messages are in sharp contrast to the words of life continually coming from God.<br /><br /> Manning doesn't imply that Christians should ignore sins; rather, he strives to help us acknowledge our flaws and brokenness, so that we can confess our sins and accept ourselves as Christ does-without condemnation or accusation but with gladness of heart.<br /><br />He points out that in too many cases in the North American church our obsession with self has led to self-hatred.  His words in this book lead us from self-consciousness to God-consciousness.  As we turn to God and gain an accurate image of him, we learn that we can trust him through joy and through trials.<br /><br /> I think for all earnest readers, the end result of reading Ruthless Trust will be a stronger willingness and desire to trust God.  Through the process of reading the book, readers will find themselves being drawn into the intimacy of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and that is an outcome to be celebrated.<br /><br />Craig Stephans, author of [[ASIN:1594571465 Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays]]wallowing in guilt and shame and prevents the full acceptance of Christ's redemption.

According to prolific Christian author and Bible teacher Joyce Meyer, you can be as close to God as you want to be.  In her latest book Knowing God Intimately, Meyer teaches that it is you and not God determining your level of closeness to him.<br /><br /> Meyer is the author of 54 books.  She is the leader of an international ministry seen on television and heard on the radio around the world.  In this book, she demonstrates her teaching strengths that have helped make her ministry effective.<br /><br /> Throughout Knowing God Intimately, Meyer teaches biblical principles by citing and explaining scriptures, as well as sharing personal stories of her life and ministry.  I think that the artfulness with which Meyer teaches will bring revelation to new and mature Christians.<br /><br /> The theme of this book focuses on th intimate relationship with the Holy Spirit that God desires for every person to experience.  Meyer asserts that the Holy Spirit is present with us and wants to be active in our lives on a daily basis.  She works through the scriptures pertaining to the Holy Spirit's relationship with people.  Likewise, she details her growing relationship with the Holy Spirit since he burst into her life.<br /><br /> Meyer tries to convey to readers a sense of urgency about seeking God.  She writes, \\"Staying at the same level of intimacy with God can't satisfy us...Much of the dissatisfaction that many people experience is due to a lack of fellowship and intimacy with God through the Holy Spirit.  If you are one of those people, I believe that this book can be a turning point in your life.\\"<br /><br /> Meyer shows the reader how to develop and nurture a closer relationship to the Holy Spirit.  The reader will learn that God desires for each person to be filled with his Holy Spirit.  Meyer also teaches about the gifts of the Holy Spirit, the leading and counsel of the Holy Spirit and the fruit of the Holy Spirit.<br /><br /> One of the qualities of Meyer's writing is that she teaches with distinct humility.  She supports several of her points with stories showing her own dependency on the mercy and grace of God.  She does not make any effort promote herself but emphasizes the need to increase one's awareness of the Holy Spirit and His workings.  Old truths are presented with a freshness that will create sparks within the reader's spirit.<br /><br /> In writing of Knowing God Intimately, Meyer claims, \\"this book will help you learn how to begin walking in the Spirit and living a life of victory rather than defeat.\\"  Additionally, I think it is an effective tool for helping Christians learn about the Holy Spirit's role in the church.  Meyer teaches how the Holy Spirit endows various gifts to members of the body of Christ to bring about healthy and empowered communities of believers.<br /><br /> Reading Knowing God Intimately will help individuals enjoy living Spirit-filled lives.  Congregations that study the book will learn how to function with the love and power of the Holy Spirit.<br /><br />Craig Stephans, author of [[ASIN:1594571465 Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays]]eaches with distinct humility.

This is a population that has learned its spirituality from pop-culture icons, non-Christian parents, a liberal media, and secular high-school and college professors.<br /><br /> In The Emerging Church, Dan Kimball identifies a broad age-range of people who do not have a background in Christianity.  They have not grown up in the church, have not received a Christian education and generally do not trust the proclamations of preachers or Christian leaders.  He defines this group as the \\"post-modern\\" and \\"post-Christian\\" culture.<br /><br /> The purpose of The Emerging Church is two-fold: 1) to describe characteristics of individuals in the post-modern generation, and 2) to discuss actions the church must take to appeal to members of this emerging culture.<br /><br /> Dan Kimball comes across as a true expert on reaching members of this group with the gospel of Jesus.  He is the founding pastor of a ministry for the emerging generation.  He is a disciplined student of the Bible and of Christian leaders.<br />Much of what he writes is based on his own experiences of success and failure in ministry.  He also writes from a rich education in church history and in both traditional and contemporary spiritual studies.<br /><br /> Kimball's essential message is that what has allowed churches to reach previous generations will not work with the emerging generations of people who are not Christians.  Kimball prescribes a return to \\"vintage Christianity\\" for churches that wish to attract young unbelievers.  Kimball describes vintage Christianity as raw, basic, unapologetic, and authentic Christianity.<br /><br /> Vintage Christianity is what Kimball advises as a \\"post-seeker-sensitive\\" style and approach to ministry.  Kimball has learned that post-modern people seeking the truth about Christianity want to be immersed in a spiritual experience that reveals Jesus and his gospel.<br /><br /> In his book, Kimball offers a plethora of practical ideas and plans for creating a church environment that will impact this group.  He encourages readers to not merely change the processes of the church but to change the mindset of how church is defined.<br /><br /> The format of the book is unique.  By interspersing commentary by several prominent Christian authors in it, Kimball provides alternate perspectives on his topics.<br /><br /> Kimball includes several charts explaining changes in the values and views of the emerging generation and how this effects ministry.  By the nature of the topics he addresses, Kimball makes some broad generalizations of subjects that in reality are less concrete and more ambiguous.  Despite such generalizations, he makes important points that should not be overlooked.<br /><br /> He repeatedly emphasizes that overall, \\"the emerging church is about the Spirit of God producing missional kingdom-minded disciples of Jesus no matter what methodology we use.  The emerging church is about love and faith in a post-Christian world.  The emerging church is about Jesus.\\"<br /><br /> This book will be helpful to all Christian readers interested in sharing the gospel with unbelievers. It may become a manual for sharing Jesus with an emerging number of Americans that simply do not know the truth about him.<br /><br />Craig Stephans, author of [[ASIN:1594571465 Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays]]e immersed in a spiritual experience that reveals Jesus and his gospel.

After listening to my story, he disappeared for a few minutes, and when he returned he set a book on the table and told me I had to read it. The book was The Journey of Desire by John Elderidge.<br /><br /> I took my friend's word for it and read the book.  He was right!  I did need to read the book. I do not recall ever reading a book that seemed to speak directly to me as this one did.  If prior to his writing this book, I had sat down with Elderidge and shared specific details of my life with him, I do not think he could have written a book that speaks to me more than The Journey of Desire does.<br /><br /> In The Journey of Desire, Elderidge delves into the mystery of redemptive life in a fallen world.  He speaks to the disappointment and disillusionment that Christians experience as we try to live the life we desire and have known only in our dreams.  He writes, \\"We all know the dilemma of desire, how awful it feels to open our hearts to joy only to have grief come in.  They go together.  We know that.  What we don't know is what to do with it, how to live in this world with desire so deep in us and disappointment lurking behind every corner.\\"(23)<br /><br />Elderidge teaches the reader to examine his or her heart and to discern whether there is still hunger and thirst for the heart's desires or whether grief and disappointment have caused apathy and complacence. The book works to resurrect the God-inspired heart's desires that we all possess.<br /><br />Elderidge reminds us that the greatest enemy to holiness is not passion but apathy.  He wants to help us direct our passions toward God and away from the many temptations in the world that serve to anesthetize and pervert our desires rather than fulfill them.<br /><br />One of the biggest lessons that Elderidge expounds upon is that no matter how hard we try to find life in the things of this world we cannot.  We cannot create or design the perfect life that satisfies all of our heart's desires.  Elderidge writes that we must receive that abundant life from God.<br /><br />The journey of desire is also the battle of desire.  The battle is to guard our hearts, to keep our passions alive and pure, and to focus our desires on the Creator.  Elderidge counsels us to remember that we are eternal people.  Jesus went away to prepare a place for us.  It is not here, and we must refrain from trying to create our place here rather than being eternally-minded.<br /><br />The book teaches that some Christians may have retreated from seeking, asking and knocking for the fulfillment of desires; instead, they are suppressing, numbing and distorting desires in a futile attempt to live without pain, grief or disappointment.  The path Elderidge suggests we take is one of trust.  Elderidge encourages us to trust God enough to faithfully ask him to clarify, intensify, and satisfy our heart's desires.<br /><br />Elderidge emphasizes the true nature of our eternal relationship with Jesus.  He writes that it is a love affair; it is a romance that will find its fulfillment only when we find our fulfillment in paradise.<br /><br />Because I believe that much of what is true for me is true to some extent for most if not all Christians, I can sincerely say to you that I believe you need to read this book.<br /><br />Craig Stephans, author of [[ASIN:1594571465 Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays]]d we cannot.

US	32693047	R17L4LWU80HHFK	0785265228	307074481	The Name	Books	5	7	8	N	N	I don't think readers will be disappointed	In The Name, Franklin Graham stands against the religious wave of tolerance and relativity that combats the assertion by Christians that Jesus alone is Lord.  This book centers on the singularity of the name, Jesus Christ.  Graham recounts personal stories, historical narratives and modern missionary exploits in demonstrating the power and effect of the name of Jesus.<br /><br /> I was immediately intrigued by Graham's experiences in ministering at high profile events.  He shares his thoughts and feelings related to delivering addresses at the Columbine memorial service, the President's inauguration and the memorial service following the September 11th attacks.  He discusses the positive and negative responses generated by his strong stance in declaring the Lordship of Jesus Christ at these ecumenical events.<br /><br /> Since September 11, 2001, Graham has been one of the few people who have cited on national news shows the stark differences between Christianity and other religions, namely Islam.  In The Name, he devotes a chapter to outlining the contrasts between the gospel of Jesus and the religion of Islam.  His purpose is to provide evidence refuting the suggestion that the religions are similar and share a peace-loving mission.<br /><br /> Graham's tone in this book is completely evangelistic.  He writes of inspiring stories of missionaries who have sacrificed everything for the sake of sharing the love of Jesus.  These stories demonstrate the power of the name of Jesus in changing individuals and communities.<br /><br /> As president of Samaritan's Purse, a Christian relief and evangelistic organization, Graham has been involved in relief efforts around the world.  He reports how simple gifts of food, toys and medical care have won hearts to Jesus.<br /><br /> The stories of people battling hunger, poverty, disease, war and discrimination put life in a different perspective than our day-to-day vision.  Graham shows that a heart of compassion and an outreaching hand can indeed transform lives.<br /><br /> The Name's aim contrasts some of the messages in the American church today that focus on getting \\"blessings\\" from God.  The essence of Graham's message is the reward of giving up everything for God.<br /><br /> Reading this book challenged me to examine my desires, activities and motives.  It is similar to reading the Book of Acts and wondering, \\"How does my life compare with the evangelists who sacrificed everything for the Name?\\"<br /><br />Craig Stephans, author of [[ASIN:1594571465 Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays]]s.

I suggested she visit two day care centers I had liked, visit the pediatrician my wife and I chose, and read Protecting the Gift by Gavin de Becker.<br /><br /> Gavin de Becker makes his living predicting and preventing violent behavior.  His firm provides security and consultation to celebrities, athletes, world leaders, the CIA, U. S. Supreme Court and other security organizations around the world.<br /><br /> In Protecting the Gift, de Becker introduces parents to startling statistics revealing the violent reality of our culture: one in four girls and one in six boys will be sexually molested by the time they reach adulthood; 90 percent of sexual abuse is committed by someone the child knows; the most common age that sexual abuse begins is when the child is three years old.  Most parents live with a mindset that denies or ignores this reality.  But as de Becker shows in his book, our children are living in this reality everyday.<br /><br /> De Becker's purpose in this book is two-fold: 1) to hit parents in the face with the real dangers awaiting children, and 2) to teach parents how to avoid fruitless worry and to take meaningful steps to protect children.  On both points, de Becker succeeds.<br /><br /> Parents are raising children during an age when an FBI child-pornography sting indicts teachers, coaches, pastors and judges.  It is an age of guns and date-rape drugs.  At the same time, many parents experience an urgent need for help in raising children, often from the age of six-weeks onward.  Parents look for family, day care workers, sitters, schools, nannies and friends to provide support in raising children.  How can parents assure their children's safety?<br /><br /> De Becker addresses this question by first focusing on the fact that violent behavior can be predicted.  The book teaches that children can be taught skills to avoid dangerous situations and people.  He emphasizes the development and use of intuition as a parent's key resource in recognizing threats.  He cites numerous stories of people avoiding harm by listening to intuition and others who ignored intuition and became victims.<br />De Becker shares many practical lessons.  He teaches what to look for in safe child-care workers and sitters.  He lists the signs that indicate a dangerous stranger versus a friendly stranger.  He also illustrates ways that well-meaning parents do things that increase a child's vulnerabilities.<br /><br />The Bible teaches that wolves dress in sheep's clothing and that evil-doers masquerade as angels of light.  Nothing fits this description more precisely than a sexual predator of children.  De Becker teaches that pedophiles and rapists often gain the confidence of their victims through being overly \\"nice\\" and \\"helpful.\\"  They have to do this.  How else can a pedophile convince parents to trust him or her with their children.  Over and over, we see that pedophiles go to where they can have access to children and, like chameleons, blend in perfectly.<br />I think people in the church today are especially susceptible to this type of criminal, because the presence of evil has been downplayed and we are usually willing to give people the benefit of the doubt and accept them at face-value.  De Becker shows parents how to remove doubt and to know who can and cannot be trusted.<br /><br />There are several other topics in this book that I think are important to parents.  The book cover summarizes one of de Becker's purposes in writing it: \\"By showing what danger really looks like-as opposed to what we might imagine it looks like-de Becker gives parents freedom from many common worries and unwarranted fears.\\"<br /><br />A lasting impression I take from the book is that the people with whom I and my family interact are who they are not who I want them to be.  I know that some people are influenced by perverse and evil desires aimed at children.  Because of this truth, I think it is important that parents read this book.  I also suggest that adults, especially women, read de Becker's bestseller The Gift of Fear.<br /><br />Craig Stephans, author of [[ASIN:1594571465 Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays]]that the people with whom I and my family interact are who they are not who I want them to be.

It's all about you, Jesus.\\"  The Jesus I Never Knew is all about Jesus.<br /><br />Yancey writes not as a mere scholar penning a textbook about Jesus; although his scholastic competence outweighs all but a few Christian writers I have read, he writes as if he were leading a small group discussion about his hero Jesus.  For each topic concerning Jesus that he addresses, Yancey stimulates the reader by drawing from personal stories and insights, quotes from historians, philosophers and other Christian writers.  He asks provoking questions that aim at the heart of our Christianity.  The reader cannot avoid examining his or her own relationship to Jesus.<br /><br />Yancey's tone is genuine and informal, never condescending or too theological.  The impression I had while reading the book is that Yancey truly wants to know Jesus and wants to reader to know Jesus even more.<br /><br />The Jesus I Never Knew is divided into three sections: \\"Who He Was,\\" \\"Why He Came,\\" and \\"What He Left Behind.\\"  Within each of these sections are three to six chapters.  Each chapter covers particular stages, events, accomplishments, sacrifices or lessons of Jesus.  The book never dwells on a peripheral subject or tangent; from cover to cover, Yancey centers his attention on Jesus.<br /><br />In the opening chapter of the book, \\"The Jesus I thought I knew,\\" Yancey confesses that he tends to write as a means of confronting his own doubts.  The doubt he confronts through this book is whether the Jesus he worships and imagines is in fact the true Jesus or a distorted image of Jesus created by a combination of heretical religious doctrines, cultural idiosyncrasies, and self-serving opinion.  The reader cannot help but to confront the same issue, and it is a question all Christians should ask from time to time-perhaps everyday: \\"Is the Jesus I know the true Jesus?\\"<br /><br />The uniqueness of The Jesus I Never Knew is due at least partially to Yancey's background as a professional journalist.  He currently serves as editor-at-large for Christianity Today magazine.  He delves into the life of Jesus as an investigating journalist searching to uncover clues showing the truth.  In doing so, he expands upon the accounts of Jesus' life found in the gospels and offers perspectives stemming from the times in which Jesus lived and the people around him in relation to his words and deeds.<br /><br />Due to Yancey's prominence in Christian writing and speaking, he possesses a keen awareness of the trends in Christian churches today regarding views of Jesus. He challenges some of the attitudes of today's Christians in an attempt to realign the reader with the true Jesus of the gospels and his teachings.<br />In the book's last chapter, \\"The Difference He Makes,\\" Yancey conveys the essence of the book,<br /><br />The story of Jesus is the story of a celebration, a story of love.  It involves pain and disappointment, yes, for God as well as for us.  But Jesus embodies the promise of a God who will go to any length to win us back.  Not the least of Jesus' accomplishments is that he made us somehow lovable to God (269).<br /><br />Yancey's book will help you fall more in love with Jesus.  It reminds me that Jesus is exactly who I want my Lord to be.<br /><br /> If you enjoy reading \\"The Jesus I Never Knew,\\" you may want to consider reading other books Yancey has written especially the award-winning \\"What is So Amazing About Grace.\\"<br />Craig Stephans, author of [[ASIN:1594571465 Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays]]?\\"    The uniqueness of The Jesus I Never Knew is due at least partially to Yancey's background as a professional journalist.

According to Warren, we exist for the purposes of worship, ministry, evangelism, fellowship and discipleship.  He states that in fulfilling these roles on earth, we find and fulfill our purposes.<br /><br /> This is a comprehensive book about how to live the Christian life successfully.  It discusses most of the major themes of The Bible.  Warren cites over 1,000 scriptures in the book.  He rarely makes a point without quoting from the Bible.  The messages of the chapters are relevant for new and mature Christians.<br /><br /> The book is formatted in 40 chapters.  Warren suggests readers study a chapter a day for 40 days, so that the reader can take time to reflect and meditate on each chapter's lesson.  Each chapter ends with a main point to consider, a scripture to remember and a question to answer.  I found these questions to be thought-provoking and meaningful.<br /><br /> This book is an excellent tool for study groups to read and discuss.  It emphasizes the importance of Christian character development and of becoming an active member of a community of believers.  Warren provides reasons and practical ways for the reader to serve others inside and outside the church.<br /><br />For a church wanting to develop individuals excited and prepared to do ministry, promoting studies of The Purpose-Driven Life would help to meet this objective.  Warren concludes the book by addressing each person's mission within the church and world.  He also includes an appendix with further questions to initiate discussion among readers.<br /><br /> In citing 1000 scriptures throughout the book, Warren uses 15 different Bible translations interchangeably. He explains that all translations have limitations and that he uses various translations to present scriptures in a fresh way.  The references for the scriptures he quotes are in endnotes, so I was continually turning to the back of the book to discover the version and verse of a scripture.  To a minor extent, I think this undermines the integrity and flow of the book.<br /><br /> I always try to keep in mind when reading a book like this that the author's opinions are not infallible like the Bible. I say this because there are a few times while reading this book when I disagreed with an opinion of Warren's which was stated as a fact.  Readers should keep in mind that opinions of Christian authors are debatable and not gospel.<br /><br /> I don't think these two criticisms detract much from the value of this book.<br /><br />Warren writes that \\"The purpose of your life fits into a much larger, cosmic purpose that God has designed for eternity.  That's what this book is about.\\" In The Purpose Driven Life, Warren has written indefatigably about this purpose, and I think reading it will help you identify and fulfill your purpose.<br /><br />Craig Stephans, author of [[ASIN:1594571465 Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays]]tures in a fresh way.

How Would Jesus Raise a Child? written by Teresa Whitehurst Ph. D., might be just what you are looking for to read.  It raises the bar for Christian parenting books.  Dr. Whitehurst captures the essence of the character and teachings of Jesus and skillfully applies them to parenting.<br /><br />Dr. Whitehurst is a clinical psychologist currently working in research on leadership at Harvard University.  She has a background as a therapist who has worked extensively with families.  She is also a mother of two daughters and has balanced parenting, work and pursuing her education.<br /><br />The value of the book comes from her applying the lessons from Jesus' life to the issues parents and children face. She draws from her clinical and parenting experience, education and research to identify the challenges that parents must overcome.<br /><br />A reader might infer from the title of this book that the author is attempting to take advantage of the \\"What Would Jesus Do?\\" trend in the Christian culture.  This is not the case however.  Dr. Whitehurst has written a book that truly answers the question of how Jesus would raise children if he were a parent today.<br /><br />She examines his way of life, his relations with his family, disciples, strangers and children.  She looks well beyond the scriptures that speak directly of parenting and looks to the heart and soul of Jesus.<br /><br />How Would Jesus Raise a Child? consists of two parts: \\"Our Inner Growth Comes First\\" and \\"A New Paradigm of Guiding Your Child;\\" each consists of five chapters.  Dr. Whitehurst  focuses equally on the parent's care for self and on parenting strategies.<br /><br />This is not another parenting book that offers a list of expert opinions and rules to follow that may or may not be the best thing for a child.  Dr. Whitehurst bases her instructions on the need for parents to express the same love, compassion, gentleness and teaching style that Jesus embodied during his three years of ministry.  As Jesus emphasizes the importance of service to his followers, Dr. Whitehurst writes, \\"Service is at the heart of parenthood.\\"<br /><br />Each chapter in the book presents a balance of insights and lessons from Jesus' life, Dr. Whitehurst's clinical expertise, and other writers and teachers.  Throughout the book, Dr. Whitehurst also offers comparisons between parenting and living like Jesus and parenting and living like the world.  She illustrates quite a contrast.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite chapter is \\"Encouraging Your Child's Potential.\\"  In this chapter, Dr. Whitehurst shows how to teach, inspire and discipline children while also giving them the freedom to find their own identity and passions.  She sums up the importance of providing positive support to children, \\"Since children tend to view God much as they do their parents, showing an interest in them boosts their confidence that God too is on their side and wants them to fully develop their unique gifts.  And this may be the most important lesson of all.\\"<br /><br />I appreciated the several times when Dr. Whitehurst shared successes and failings from her role as a parent.  Her honesty contributes to the overall empathetic and consultative tone of the book.<br /><br />I don't think you will find a guide to Christian parenting as significant as How Would Jesus Raise a Child? So, if you are interested in raising your children as Jesus would, then definitely read and reflect on this book.<br /><br />Craig Stephans, author of [[ASIN:1594571465 Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays]]importance of service to his followers, Dr. Whitehurst writes, \\"Service is at the heart of parenthood.\\"     Each chapter in the book presents a balance of insights and lessons from Jesus' life, Dr. Whitehurst's clinical expertise, and other writers and teachers.

It unfortunately does not offer any character development of the main characters.  We never learn much about them at all, nothing we wouldn't know from a 15 min. conversation at a cocktail party, except for secret associations and heritage.<br />The story is based on a historical conspiracy theory that the author takes seriously but that lacks ALL credible evidence.  For each assertion, there a hundreds of valid refutations that immediately jump out.  The author is making a case that is so outlandish it is beyond being debatable.  <br />I did enjoy reading it but had to completely ignore many of the claims made regarding art, history, religion and secret societies due to their lack of credibility.  <br />I am really surprised that a book based on such erroneous and illogical claims could have been published at all and then be so popular.<br />If anyone actually is swayed by the story's claims, just look at The Case for Christ by Lee Strobel or especially Josh McDowell's Evidence that Demands a Verdict, among other Christian books that offer evidence for all aspects of Christianity.  They offer historical, spiritual, religious, and scientific evidence of the verity of Christianity, as opposed to this book's conspiracy theories.<br />The truth concerning the issues relating to Jesus' life in this book are not mysteries as they are treated here.  There has been more research and study of Jesus' life than anyone else in history.  If the validity of his story and of the Bible was so ambiguous, neither would have stood against all the opposition to them both.  Something built on lies and fraud cannot withstand the violent attacks levied against the early Christians.  <br />Besides, this book purports that Constantine initiated a great fraud that caused the Catholic Church and Christianity to be based on lies.  Well Christianity was already 300 years old by that time, and the Catholic church is not synomous withChristianity.  The author doesn't even address the initial growth of Christianity in the centuries immediately following the life of Christ.  All of his logic follows this pattern--extremely shallow and easily diputed.<br />You won't be missing much if you don't read it; if you do read it, you are sure to be entertained but not taught a history or religious lesson.	2003-11-13

This is one of the themes of Waking the Dead by John Eldredge.  In it, Eldredge asserts that one of the major lessons of the Bible is that \\"things are not what they seem.\\"<br /><br />According to Eldredge, the obstacles and suffering we all face are the result of humanity's enemy battling for our hearts.  You have not blown it and God has not let you down, but this enemy daily attempts to prevent you from living in the glorious fullness of your redeemed heart, writes Eldredge.<br /><br />In Waking the Dead, Eldredge argues that God has redeemed our hearts, made them good according to his image.  He also argues that most people fail to live up to their heart's redeemed state.  Waking readers from the dead is about lifting them from the mire or status quo of their lives up to the level of the Spirit-filled life illustrated in the lives of believers in the New Testament.<br /><br />Throughout this book, Eldredge expands on a quote by the early Christian writer Irenaeus, \\"the glory of God is man fully alive.\\"  The problem, Eldredge says, is that Christians succumb to the pressures and emotions of this world and to the lies of Satan and fail to experience the abundant life.<br /><br />Through a plethora of references to scriptures, quotes, and to stories and movies such as The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Wizard of Oz, The Matrix, The Perfect Storm, and The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, Eldredge shares eternal truths of redemption and glory to illustrate the state of Christians in this world.  He also shares many personal stories that relate how God has worked in his life and through his ministry.<br /><br />The emphasis of Waking the Dead is on four streams that Eldredge believes bring Christians to the abundant life to which God has called them.  These streams are Walking with God, Receiving his Intimate Counsel, Deep Restoration and Spiritual Warfare.  He expands the discussion of the four streams with a chapter focusing on the needs and blessings of Christian fellowship.<br /><br />Eldredge is trying to show readers that a closer relationship with God is available--a relationship bringing deep healing and freedom.  In this relationship, the Christian can finally reach his or her full potential, becoming fully alive and bringing glory to God.<br /><br />Waking the Dead also includes a chapter offering specific prayers designed to help the reader experience the four streams.<br /><br />In Waking the Dead, Eldredge reaches deep into his soul and spiritual reservoir to share insights and references that will help the reader see his or her place in the heart of God.  He comes to his points from so many different angles that he is sure to hit his mark with most readers.<br /><br />Craig Stephans, author of [[ASIN:1594571465 Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays]]with a chapter focusing on the needs and blessings of Christian fellowship.

He adroitly intersperses humor into the writing that will make you laugh out loud.  The variety assures that the reader will get the important message of the book and be entertained.<br /><br />This is an upbeat book about relationships that we have with God and other people.  It also targets how we see ourselves.  The premise is that nobody is really \\"normal;\\" we all have quirks, defects and faults that make us very much in need of grace and mercy from God and others.  Likewise, we all need to give grace and mercy to others and accept that all people come \\"as is\\" rather than perfect.<br /><br />Ortberg writes, \\"when we enter relationships with the illusion that people are normal, we resist the truth that they are not.  We enter an endless attempt to fix them, control them, or pretend that they are what they're not.  One of the great marks of maturity is to accept the fact that everybody comes `as is.'\\"<br /><br />The book is divided into three main sections: \\"Normal: There's no such Thing, Dear,\\" \\"How to Get Close without Getting Hurt,\\" and \\"The Secrets of Strong Relationships.\\"<br /><br />Ortberg leads the reader to an examination of heart and soul and to open the eyes to the dynamics present in all relationships.  He focuses on principles and truths that are relevant to all people, such as the inevitability of conflict in relationships and the best way to deal with it.<br /><br />If you want to improve the way you interact with your family, co-workers, church family and people you meet everyday, this is a book that will definitely help. Each chapter is followed by several discussion questions that can be helpful to small group interaction, as well as personal reflection.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Ortberg takes great advantage of Biblical stories to convey lessons about relationships.  He artfully brings to life several Old and New Testament accounts, filling in cultural background and offering theological insights.<br /><br />I think you will thoroughly enjoy reading Everybody's Normal Till You Get to Know Them and will appreciate Ortberg's skill in writing and teaching.<br /><br />Craig Stephans, author of [[ASIN:1594571465 Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays]]ionships.

He proposes that in order to make this leap readers take prescribed steps to improve and enhance their thinking skills.<br />Maxwell bases the principles discussed in Thinking for a Change on his assertion that the one thing that separates those who go to the top from those who never seem to get there is good thinking.  In the book, he strives to teach people how to think well in order to achieve their dreams and reach their potential.  He emphasizes that this book does not try to teach the reader what to think but how to think.<br />Maxwell discusses the value and impact of improved thinking and then concentrates on eleven thinking skills that he believes lead to success.  The eleven skills include creative thinking, strategic thinking, possibility thinking, and unselfish thinking.<br />Maxwell culls ideas, stories, lessons and quotes from various sources including his own previously published books, books by other authors, magazine and journal articles, and a plethora of great and not-so-great thinkers.<br />What Thinking for a Change lacks in originality, it compensates for with excellent organization, flow and many practical suggestions to stimulate growth in thinking. I think Maxwell uses this book as an example to the reader of how effectively we can learn from others and apply their knowledge to our lives.  In the book, Maxwell offers several snapshots of his professional and personal experiences, so the reader can see how he and his organizations have prospered by using these strategies.<br />Thinking for a Change is written for the general business market.  It lacks spiritual analysis in regards to thinking and does not discuss many of the biblical issues related to the mind.  Readers will have to look elsewhere for these insights.  Maxwell does offer useful thinking methods to incorporate into your days, weeks, months and years to improve your effectiveness.<br />I think Maxwell makes a poor decision in focusing extensively on Jack Welch, the former CEO of General Electric, in the opening chapter of the book.  Maxwell cites a story about Welch and encourages the reader to follow his advice to achieve a higher level in one's career and personal life.  Those of you familiar with Welch know he reached the pinnacle of success in his career, but his success has not carried over to his personal life.<br />As a Christian professional, father and husband, I am looking for well-balanced models of success.  Maxwell's highlighting of Welch as a role model disappointed me and may have gotten me off on the wrong foot in reading this book.<br />Regardless of that criticism, I benefited from reading Thinking for a Change and believe that anyone who reads it will also benefit from each of the eleven lessons on thinking.  It is a book that inspires review and study of its main concepts and lessons.hs and years to improve your effectiveness.<br />I think Maxwell makes a poor decision in focusing extensively on Jack Welch, the former CEO of General Electric, in the opening chapter of the book.

Yes Michael Cunningham is a wonderful writer of prose, but it is inserted in unrealistic streams of consciousness revelations during his characters' mundane activities.  The lack of action in this book causes the focus to be on the characters who are revealed as self-absorbed, narcissistic and somewhat delusional while consistently whiny.  It is not hard to discern why this book, as insignificant as it is, has been lauded by the press and Hollywood.  It caters to sympathies that the press and Hollywood universally suscribe to without a search for greater truths or real meaning.  Additionally, the writer creates no sense of urgency or intrigue for the reader.  It is the equivalent of watching a soap opera in which the writers are trying their best to write like Shakespeare.	2003-01-22
