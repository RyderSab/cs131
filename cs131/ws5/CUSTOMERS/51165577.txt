I found this book on Amazon while looking for help with my love relationship. For having bought it, my thoughts regarding relationships are dramatically changed!<br /><br />The first word that comes to mind regarding the ideas, theories, and advice of \\"Love is Not a Game\\" is HUMANE. So many relationship books give platitudinal advice like \\"no contact,\\" \\"be a bitch!\\", \\"if he doesn't call you, he's just not into you...move on\\" etc. Anyone who's ever truly been in love knows these one-liner solutions don't work. They are rash or overly simplistic, or perhaps cut you off from your lover or former lover. These simplistic solutions do not take into consideration the complex dynamics between people, in particular two dimensions which Randy Hurlburt clearly defines in his book: romantic chemistry and emotional maturity. The paradox is that while interactions between people are complex, the forces of romantic chemistry and emotional maturity are measurable and help simplify what is otherwise a hopelessly murky and mysterious emotional landscape.<br /><br />Hurlburt explains how these two dimensions are the key to a successful (or not so successful) relationship. Using case studies, he shows how different levels of romantic chemistry and emotional maturity play out in a relationship. Reading these case studies and Hurlburt's examination of these forces in our lives will make sense. There is a deep wisdom to these ideas that simply feels right, and with the logical way in which the theories are presented, it becomes possible to better understand the mysterious force that we call \\"love.\\"<br /><br />Being able to assess the level of romantic chemistry and emotional maturity in yourself and your partner, and how these numbers (literally, as he uses the analogy of dice to show how the levels between partners compare) tell a story is an elegant and powerful tool. Instead of pining over lost love, you might find out your partner never had that much romantic chemistry for you in the first place. Or you could realize that the ending of a promising relationship has more to do with one or both partners' emotional maturity (or lack thereof) than a \\"fading\\" of feelings or other excuse.<br /><br />Love isn't a game, but you should know the odds. This phrase is repeated over and over again in Hurlburt's book, and it makes more and more sense as you read and understand more of his theories. In addition to ideas of romantic chemistry and emotional maturity, Hurlburt presents ideas of a \\"safety net\\" of different levels of relationship (it's ok to not be deeply in love with every person you date or even have sex with; you can have friends who are more mature or less mature than you if you can identify the ways in which these relationships could help both of you grow, etc.), the importance of understanding sexual fantasies, and the intersection of emotional maturity and spiritual advancement. Some of Hurlburt's ideas may be shocking to people who approach life from a more \\"traditional\\" point of view with rigid social and gender roles. If the glut of relationship books on the market don't offer any real solutions and instead present a candy-coated \\"feel better\\" approach, \\"Love is Not a Game\\" offers theories that you can truly put to work in understanding yourself, your partner, and your relationship. I can not recommend this book highly enough.in the first place.

This easy-to-read book is quick, fun, and quite life-altering. Its suggestions are simple yet incredibly profound, and are based on the idea that it is our THOUGHTS which are at the root of our success and failure. Several chapters are devoted to becoming AWARE of our thought patterns, by first identifying \\"mistaken certainties,\\" or things which we THINK are true but are in fact, not.<br /><br />Some self-help books make a big deal about positive thinking, but here, such a phrase isn't reduced to psychobabble -- the author makes a strong case for letting your whole self be a generator of positive thought: in other words, \\"you are what you think.\\"<br /><br />Anecdotal and personal evidence has shown me that a person's state of mind is a GREAT indicator to their level of success, personally, professionally, and socially. This book will help you become more aware of your subconsious thoughts, and how to change them to be more in line with your conscious desires.<br /><br />Robert Anthony devotes a chapter to meditation and positive affirmation, but simply reading this book will make you much more aware of any negative thought patterns or beliefs you hold, and how to go about changing them. It's likely that simply SEEING and FEELING your negative thought patterns will shine light on them, and therein lies this book's simple gift: know yourself, know your mind, and you have all you need to begin changing.<br /><br />I would recommend this simple, straightforward book over most other volumes of \\"new age\\" personal success manuals that are wordy and laden with faux-eastern, polyglot \\"spiritual\\" practices. This book is much more direct, easy to understand, and doesn't talk down to the reader or make you do esoteric ritualistic things. It just gives you some basic, simple techniques for becoming more aware of how your thoughts may be limiting.	2004-12-03

Where many books on depression fall into the \\"self-help\\" genre, Styron's remains truly a memoir, with a very \\"writerly\\" tone that sets it apart from more clinical books on depression.<br /><br />That said, \\"Darkness Visible\\" won't give you exercises, techniques, or voyueristic psychoanalytical thrills, but it will clearly summarize one man's experience with a numbing, mysterious mood distrubance.<br /><br />Styron's simplest insights are the ones that are most memorable. He states that he believes it is impossible for the healthy to imagine the upheaval that happens in the brain of a depressed person. He also posits the converse, that those striken with depression \\"forget\\" or perhaps never can remember what it was like to have a healthy brain.<br /><br />He also writes about early childhood loss, and how he believes it is the loss (death) or disappearance of a parent can wound a child in irreprable ways, setting the stage for a life-long vulnerability to mood disorders. From anecdotal evidence, I would have to agree that a pre-adolescent parental trauma is a common thread amongst  most depression cases.<br /><br />I recommend this short work to someone who has struggled with depression or is concerned they may be sliding towards it, or as a \\"teaching volume\\" to less-clinically inclined friends/family members of depression victims.	2004-10-14

Its simple exercises will have you seeing the fallacy of your thoughts, which are what determine your mood. The book (and CBT's) superbly simplistic idea is that your THOUGHTS are what control your MOODS. Control your thoughts, and you control your moods. But before we can do this, we have to slow down enough to take the time to see where our thoughts are coming from. This book and its exercises help us find where we are simply WRONG in the thoughts we have about ourselves which lead to depressed or anxious mood.<br /><br />These exercises will help you determine your \\"hot thoughts,\\" (automatic thoughts you hold about yourself that are linked to depressed/anxious mood), will help you examine evidence for and against your thoughts, and then help you use this evidence to create NEW THOUGHTS which ought to in turn help you create NEW MOODS.<br /><br />These techniques are amazingly simple but also incredibly powerful. If you feel stuck in \\"talk therapy\\" analysis and can not seem to change the way you think about yourself, this book is for you! However, you should also seek a trained COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPIST to teach you the techniques to literally CHANGE your thought process.<br /><br />Anxiety and depression are more and more common in our society, and much of what causes these mood disturbances is our incorrect/unfounded thoughts about ourselves. Once we learn to manage our thoughts, we learn to change our mood. This book and what it teaches is life-changing.	2004-10-14

This backdrop of Maoist thought, repressive social rules, and austerity is where we examine the relationship between Lin, an army doctor, and Manna, a head nurse. Lin is married to a country woman with bound feet who lives in the village. Lin works and lives in the City at the hospital. Lin returns home to the village every Summer, attempting to divorce his wife, so he can be with Manna, who, at 27, already feels an Old Maid.<br /><br />China's social rules are a major player in this lean and honest novel. Manna, as a young single woman, feels desperate to marry. Since she and Lin have become \\"friends,\\" the whole hospital treats them as fiancees, reducing Manna's possibilities for finding another man. Meanwhile, in the village, Lin's brother-in-law pulls strings to keep Lin married to his country wife.<br /><br />Love is never JUST love in this novel. It's the feelings and actions of Communist party superiors, the whispered rumors of co-workers, the angered villagers who resent Lin's \\"citified\\" ideas about divorce. But at its core, this novel is about the darkness that lies within the human heart, its complexitiy and occasional fickleness, its difficulty choosing and loving wholeheartedly, and the spiraling confusion, pain, and changed lives that such a heart leaves in its wake.<br /><br />This novel's strength lies in its descriptions of social mores in China, its simple, lyrical language that gets to the heart of the matter, and its unflinchingly honest assessment of human relationships and love.	2004-09-14

The hype about her had gotten to me and I decided to check her out. This isn't fancy literature...this is pure, good old-fashioned writing for fun. But it's well done. The plot moves quickly and like the other reviews have mentioned, you could read this book in one sitting: it keeps you turning pages like that.<br /><br />This particular book deals with the main character's multiple personality disorder. It's through this that the erotica gets to come out (via one of the \\"alternate personalities\\"). There's also some good old fashioned romance in here, family drama, nightlife escapades, and medical/psychological drama (the character of psychiatrist Marcella Spencer is good).<br /><br />Recommended. Not mind-bending literature, but good fun.	2004-09-05

It's not the case. While it does offer some good reminders (men are visual, men and women are DIFFERENT, don't hint with men, etc.), some of the book feels dated and Berkowitz's tone is that of a smarmy glossy magazine writer (which he happens to be, as well as a correspondent for various daytime TV programs like Today).<br /><br />The book can be read in one sitting, and since it's very light, you won't feel weighed down if you consume it all at once. Recommended, but more for fun and as a time-passer than as a real cornerstone of understanding the differences between the sexes or developing a really deep understanding of men.	2004-07-26

I picked this book up based on the cover design, then read the back jacket and decided it was a book for me! I love &quot;true life&quot; stories and this is one of the more bizarre ones you will ever read.<br /><br /> This is the story of a prisoner as told by a man who came to befriend him over repeated visits to the prison. The plot centers around the man's 4+ year stint in Bolivian prison, but tells so much more than this story. &quot;Marching Powder&quot; delves into the rampant corruption inside the prison, the bizarre, surreal microcosm of the prison, and one man's odyssey to be released from prison and continue with his life. If you have seen the film &quot;Midnight Express,&quot; this book is reminiscent of it.<br /><br /> The story takes place almost entirely inside a Bolivian prison. Life inside this prison has its own set of rules and regulations, and is unlike anything you could imagine. The prison has its own economy, its own neighborhoods, and a cast of characters (including a crack-addicted cat) that could have come out of a movie.<br /><br /> The book moves quickly, the writing is fluid and vivid, the characters are larger than life, and some of the details can be jaw-dropping.	2004-07-20

It is about love, death, youth, friendship, and ultimately, how fragile and delicate humans are, and how much we seek protection from this fragility in the arms of others or in our own private prisons. Toru Watanabe, the protagonist, locks himself in a prison of solitude, which he eventually escapes, with difficulty, only through the death of a close friend/lover and the realization that he is basically alone in the world. This realization forces him to come to terms with his feelings for a woman who challenges his cold side while simultaneously acknowledging his softer side via her own need for companionship, understanding, and love.<br />There are many deaths in this book, although they take place somewhat at the outskirts of the other action. The deaths act as catalysts for characters to learn, grow, change, or in some cases, retreat, wither, and become isolated. It is this constant interplay between retreat and advancement, withering and growth, isolation and togetherness, which seems to be a theme of this novel, and a central struggle each and every one of its characters must face. In that respect, Murakami has hit on a central struggle for all humans: intimacy vs. independence.<br />It's Murakami's amazingly poetic writing, his evocative, sensual observations, and the way he renders characters so complex with the simplest of language and details that makes this novel so memorable. Another reviewer compared it to Milan Kundera's &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot; and while the content and themes are somewhat different, perhaps the lesson is that the elusive &quot;comfort zone,&quot; finding it and staying in it, is a major concern of and struggle for most people. There is always something ready to knock us off or out of that balance.<br />The ending of this novel doesn't suggest that Watanabe has found that balance or lost it. It really says nothing about how Watanabe resolves the current dynamics in his life. And perhaps that &quot;non-ending&quot; is just another reflection of the &quot;unbearable lightness of being,&quot; the strange place which we seem to inhabit only at times, when our expectations, needs, and actions all seem to magically work together at once. The normal state of affairs is that these things conspire to unbalance us, especially when we bring other people into the equation. &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; expresses, in beautiful language, how the balance between people is so delicate, and how it sometimes takes a major catalyst, like death or loss, to jolt us into understanding our inter-connectedness.aying in it, is a major concern of and struggle for most people.

I really enjoyed this book. I read it several years ago and often remember it. I was drawn to the book by its cover and because, at the time, I had a close friend who was from USVI. Anyway, I thought this was a really special book written by two people (a married couple) who actually put their dream into motion.<br />Their dream? To move to the US Virgin Islands and get on &quot;island time.&quot; For people who are not from the Caribbean, making the move to this totally different lifestyle might seem impractical, but this couple shows how they planned out, to the T, their move, complete with saving money, bringing their automobiles to the island, finding work (ultimately setting up their own business on the island), and adjusting to a very different lifestyle.<br />There is good advice in this book about making a long-distance and culture-shifting move. It takes planning. After reading &quot;Desiring Paradise&quot; I felt that, if I should ever take up my fantasy of owning a mango farm somewhere in the Caribbean, I could do it. It really is an inspirational book in that way. It's also a great book for armchair travellers. As its nonfiction, there are some great slice-of-life passages about the Virgin Islands, their topography, their people, and the much more humane way in which people live and relate there. Everytime I think about this book, I am filled with warm memories, both of the book and of my visit to USVI.<br />I would recommend this book to: people considering moving to the Virgin Islands; people interested in the USVI or modern-day Caribbean culture in general; those interested in a good story about planning and goal-setting and the amazing results it can have.	2004-04-03

An search for marketing books one day on Amazon lead to the pre-hardcover release information of this book: I since followed the book's release and dispersal into the public realm with interest, and bought it to read on a vacation.<br />I finished the book quickly, as once it gets going (a few chapters in), the book is hard to put down. The character development is excellent, and plot exciting and adventurous like a good spy novel, and the descriptions of foreign places (Tokyo, London, Russia) full of detail and nuance.<br />However, for me, the strongest part of the book was its spot-on assessment of what modern people have become, and the culture in which we live: a global, digitally-enhanced and -supported lifestyle that becomes more and more pervasive as technology becomes cheaper and continues its encroachment upon nearly all parts of the world. Gibson has obviously spent time in chat rooms and message boards; has tasted what it is to follow an obsession (so easy to do with the internet, be it person or thing); has experienced the \\"soul delay\\" of business travel (three countries in three days); and learned the art of Goggling and other internet-based research techniques, for all these ideas give major structure to the novel.<br />Internet junkies, fashionistas, armchair travellers, and collectors of obscure objects will all be able to relate to this story. As disparate as those elements may sound, Gibson has neatly wrapped them up into one quirky person, the protagonist Cayce Pollard, who embodies most of Gibson's ideas and cultural observations. Gibson also uses several terms throughout the book, which you will either catch the first time they are explained, or seek out their meaning once you realize their place in the narrative. These terms seem to derive from marketing or internet lingo, which serve as idiomatic themes for the way the characters communicate (both in person and \\"virtually\\").<br />My only complaint about this book is that the ending is a bit of a let down. After such a masterfully paced biuld up, the ending didn't have as much impact as the rest of the book: the wrap-up seemed hasty, the characters not as well developed as the ones who were introduced earlier, and some of it seemed just a bit implausible. It almost seemed like Gibson had too good a time writing this book to find an adequate way to end it. But the book is still unquestionably excellent and modern, and a somewhat lazy ending doesn't detract from Gibson's wonderful prose style or his astute comments on human civilization in the 21st Century.th in person and \\"virtually\\"). <br />My only complaint about this book is that the ending is a bit of a let down.

This book has a bit of the &quot;preaching to the converted&quot; about it, which doesn't detract from its value, but I believe any one who would pick up a book sub-titled &quot;The Art of Being Fully Human&quot; is probably already quite concerned with the topics touched on in this book (spirituality, the role of death, intimacy and connectedness, etc.), and is probably on the path of being &quot;fully human.&quot;<br />Each chapter is like a meditation on the topic by Buscaglia. The chapters are short and have some wise and lovely details. The insights he makes feel familiar, and I wasn't as challenged as I'd expected to be. Nevertheless, this book helped me feel better about where I am in life, and reinforced my beliefs that I've come to have about what it is to &quot;live artfully.&quot;<br />These days, a lot of &quot;personal growth&quot; literature is more acquisitive and seems to focus on personal growth as a means to an end rather than for the betterment of global society. &quot;Personhood&quot; thus feels like a relic in some ways, of the personal growth/spirituality movements of the 70s, where personal growth and global awareness were connected ideals. This idea is retained in &quot;Personhood&quot; and is perhaps the book's greatest asset.	2004-02-19

The first sentence of the book, \\"life is difficult,\\" reflects Scott Peck's idea that spiritual/mental growth must be worked towards, that human beings are generally lazy, and that growth of consciousness is a life-long process. Everything is generally working against our growth: laziness; defense mechanisms employed to maintain the status quo of mental illness over the struggle for accepting responsibility; confusion over the true nature of love; resistance to \\"grace\\"  (the idea of being open to our unconscious and the symbolic language of God); lack of discipline; adults being mentally and spiritually immature; poor parenting resulting in nuerosis and character disorder; and a culture that generally defends, accepts, and nurtures sickness over health.<br />Sometimes Scott Peck's language is a little heavy, but it's only because he packs so much valuable information and insight into each page. The first chapter on Discipline (a tool to solve our problems. Another great Peck idea: see problems as challenges, and it is in our response to problems that life takes on its meaning and color) was a bit dry to me, but contains excellent information on delaying gratification, balancing and bracketing (attempting to listen to others/view situations with objectivity), dedication to the truth, and a key to anyone seeking to grow: ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY.<br />The second section on Love was fascinating to me. Scott Peck does a great job debunking the myth of romantic love, but perhaps most valuable is the idea that real loving is about nurturing your own or another's spiritual growth. Love is an action and a decision, not just a feeling. It's so easy in our culture to imagine love as a feeling, red roses, wine, dinners, etc. That is the illusion of romance but has nothing to do with the work and courage of real active loving (Scott Peck says if an action doesn't involve courage or work, it's not loving!). Also in this chapter are a few controversial ideas, namely open marriage (Scott Peck's extension of the idea that loving involves encouraging an individual's total development...hmmm...sort of vague extension to me to involve plural relationships. what happened to discipline?) and even Scott Peck's suggestion that he would have sex with a patient if he felt it would further both their spiritual development! (do not agree with this at all. any person in treatment is not in a position to navigate such power dynamics)<br />The final section on Grace reminds us to look to our unconscious for information and guidance. Dreams, nagging thoughts, sudden insights, etc. from our unconscious, which Scott Peck says knows more than our conscious ever could, are signs that there is a God, and he/she/it is a loving God interested in our spiritual development (reflection of Scott Peck's idea of love, and a good idea if you ask me). These signs are meant to prod us into action.<br />In general, although at times you will be re-reading pages to make sure you got the meaning, and sometimes Scott Peck's language will seem heavy and plodding, this book will help you see where you can expand the boundaries of your spirit, your mind, and your life, how you can love bigger and better (and make it mean more to everyone), how your life can have meaning and consistency, and how to be a loving, conscious person, parent, lover, mate, and friend. I underlined a LOT in this book, and going back to read just my underlines I am amazed at the amount of loving, valuable insight in this book. Growing and truly accepting responsibility for the quality of our lives is not as easy as it sounds. Scott Peck is very aware of this and gives a lot of support to keep on journeying this road less traveled.real active loving (Scott Peck says if an action doesn't involve courage or work, it's not loving!).

(do not agree with this at all. any person in treatment is not in a position to navigate such power dynamics)<br />The final section on Grace reminds us to look to our unconscious for information and guidance. Dreams, nagging thoughts, sudden insights, etc. from our unconscious, which Scott Peck says knows more than our conscious ever could, are signs that there is a God, and he/she/it is a loving God interested in our spiritual development (reflection of Scott Peck's idea of love, and a good idea if you ask me). These signs are meant to prod us into action. <br />In general, although at times you will be re-reading pages to make sure you got the meaning, and sometimes Scott Peck's language will seem heavy and plodding, this book will help you see where you can expand the boundaries of your spirit, your mind, and your life, how you can love bigger and better (and make it mean more to everyone), how your life can have meaning and consistency, and how to be a loving, conscious person, parent, lover, mate, and friend. I underlined a LOT in this book, and going back to read just my underlines I am amazed at the amount of loving, valuable insight in this book. Growing and truly accepting responsibility for the quality of our lives is not as easy as it sounds. Scott Peck is very aware of this and gives a lot of support to keep on journeying this road less traveled.	2003-03-05

This book has just about everything I could ever ask for in a read: amazing, memorable characters that are so strange and unique that they feel all too real; dialouge lovingly rendered for each character; a wild ride across the globe, through history, customs, food, clothing, mating rituals, social class, and mythology; an amazingly intricate and creative plot that eventually ties up in the end; and finally, a grand theme that serves as the foundation to this whole wonderful, wild, imaginative, freeing ride.<br />One gets the feeling that Robbins had a grand time writing this book. I was laughing out loud on one page, underlining passages of exquisite wisdom the next. Everything flows so naturally; the feel of this book is LIGHT, airy, featherweight. Yet like a drone or mantra, its rhythm and texture winds its way into you until you have been relaxed by Robbins' prose into another mindscape: HIS, or perhaps, yours, expanded.<br />Robbins is a master of metaphors. And comedy. And when he combines the two, you WILL be re-reading passages wondering &quot;how did he do that?&quot; Robbins is truly a master and has a strong, unique, comedic, wise, wild, creative voice. Highly recommended. I guess I will soon be reading &quot;Jitterbug Perfume&quot; for a second, third, fourth, etc. time.	2003-01-28

Along with the support of friends and a near-breakdown that took me to the door of madness, this book helped me reconsider my \\"problems\\" as opportunities for growth. I am aware that certain strains of Buddhism also speak of using problems as catapaults to growth. Here, Iyanla trances her life (almost chronologically) and, with hindsight, forms a lesson for each particular situation she faced. Many of her lessons came from difficult situations: abuse, infidelity, poverty, teenage pregnancy, an absent father, etc.<br />Central to her process is remembering, which from personal experience, is often one of the hardest things to do, especially if you have a vested interest in forgetting. But that's the point: without remembering, the lessons will never truly stick. And this act of remembering takes LOTS of effort and time. Iyanla, despite her \\"success\\" and public profile, admits that she still has healing to do, that in fact it's a life long process. This is especially true for those of us who have waited decades to actually begin to \\"clean up the crap.\\" There are years of hard-wired behavior patterns that must be seen, analysed (self-analysis is a major part of her style/technique for growth), and then EFFORT must be applied to change them.<br />For anyone who has walked the path before, changing adult human behavior requires major effort and awareness. Iyanla's writing helps keep you in a place of awareness and helps refocus our efforts on our OWN LIFE and its meaning in the cosmos. In other words, while sometimes it appears we strive to change to make ourselves more attractive in a relationship, more employable, more socially interesting, ultimately we must change only for ourselves and our own desire for a BETTER life, a more intimate life with ourselves. Only once this is achieved can we hope to share with others.<br />There are many other techniques and ideas which are helpful. For example: old self vs. new self (Iyanla is not Iyanla's birth name but a name she took for her developing self); prayer (even if you don't believe in God or have a particular faith, prayer keeps you focused on what is necessary for your healing and growth); creating a supportive community.<br />Read, enjoy, and WORK with this book. I highly recommend it. It is like a memoir in some way, and shows how one woman mined her life for lessons and put forth the effort to remake herself beyond her subconsious patterns, fears, and social/economic class.which are helpful.

The pace of this story makes it easy to consume, and like a thick chocolate milkshake, you'll be loving it while it's going down, then feel maybe a little yucky the next day. The characters are fascinating because you wonder if such people really exist or if they are just semi-monsters created in Palahiuk's mind. One thing about Palahniuk, his characters are consistent, so a creep is a creep throughout. There is a shot at some redemption/healing stuff going on here at the end, with one of the characters, an ex-sex addict who collected a large rock each day he didn't jerk off, that seems perhaps a touch out of place, but is necessary for Palahniuk to tie together the threads of his ideas. Not a \\"deep\\" book per se, fun to read and thought-provoking in some respects. Quick and (relatively) painless.	2003-01-11

It is a mix of politcal commentary/journalism, memoir, and travel diary. The working poor is the subject of this book, specifically, the myriad minefields awaiting anyone who lives in the U.S. and is struggling financially. Ehrenreich's observations show how intimately connected life factors can be: poverty and health; education and outlook; support systems and the breakdown of families due to societal problems. It is still fashionable to blame the poor for their condition, and the \\"American Dream\\" still has enough success stories to keep its stock value up. But the vast majority of working poor are living how the people in this book are. I believe this because I live in New York City and see for myself my own friends' and associates' lives, and how even with education, a supportive family and friend network, and a positive outlook, life can at times be excrutiatingly difficult. The divide between rich and poor grows ever wider in the U.S., and this book reveals in detail how wealth inequality affects a human life. It is shocking that a country as \\"advanced\\" and rich as the U.S. can not provide for its citizenry in a more humane fashion. Over time, the effects of not building a strong citizenry will come back to haunt this country. At this point in time, it apprears there is a working cadre sufficiently anesthetized to work for meager wages and fulfill their role at the bottom of the social heap. But lack of education, healthcare, lack of job preparedness and technological innovation will eventually become a burden on this society. The U.S. could be investing in its human resource and building a truly great nation. But clearly, as Ehrenreich's book shows, the working poor have been cast as \\"screw ups\\" who need to find the solutions themselves.	2003-01-11

I don't think this is a book about sex or war or infidelity. It is about choice. Sex, war, etc. are metaphors used to convey the choices we (and those around us) make, and ultimately, how we respond to choice. Each character experiences some sort of crisis which demands a choice. Some choices are made swiftly and strongly (Sabina leaving Geneva once her lover Franz leaves his wife), other choices seem to come after years of indecision, and perhaps a change in the character's desires/needs (Tomas finding happiness in the country). Each one of the main characters finds some aspect of happiness in finally coming to terms with their lives and themselves, yet the characters are all so different. One of this book's most important questions for me is: are we more different than we are alike (Tomas' 1% of difference among women)? And if so, does that difference make some of us fundamentally incompatible, destined to live parallel lives without ever having the opportunity to connect and learn from the one who is deemed incompatible? I think we stand to learn the most from people/situations which vex us, provided we can maintain our centerdness and approach the tension (like that between Tomas & Tereza) with an eye to what it might help us learn about ourselves.	2003-01-11

Schaef, a recovered &quot;pseudo relationship&quot; addict, details all the tricks of this disease, which is a progressive and fatal addiction like all other addictions (drugs, alcohol).<br />if you think this statement sounds like malarky, read Schaef's book to see how true it is! Addiction serves to alter a person's mood or perception. This can be accomplished without drugs or alcohol. Relationship addiction is a &quot;process addiction,&quot; whereby the addict spends his or her time focusing on an external stimulus (the relationship) instead of taking care of their Self! Most useful is Schaef's list of behaviors exhibit by sex, romance, or relationship addicts. I found myself in nearly every one!<br />This constellation of addictions is tricky to detect because the very skills to support the addiction &quot;appear&quot; to be relationship skills AS TAUGHT on tv, movies, in the general folklore of our culture. Which, as Schaef explains, is an addictive society, so it reinforces our addictive behaviors. These process addictions are VERY common, and at the heart of other conditions such as depression, anxiety, etc.<br />DO NOT BE FOOLED...cynics may read this review and find what I've written here to be self-help/new-age gibberish. Schaef's book is very short (158 pp.), extrememly readable, totally lucid, and very clearly organized, with information that builds on itself in an expert, lockstep manner.<br />I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who suffers in relationships. If you have failed relationship after failed relationship, or are in an abusive situation, or feel compelled to lie/cheat/distort the truth to maintain a relationship, or have any other self-realized behavior that you know is unhealthy but don't know what is &quot;wrong,&quot; PLEASE READ THIS BOOK.<br />I believe this book will have a life-changing affect on anyone who reads it and relates to the information within.

He lets the errors of judgement and difficulties of life stand out glaringly clear to all of those who should choose to read them.<br />This was one of the most profound, important books I've ever read for several reasons. One, it helped me understand the black male psyche from one point of view (mccall's) but when paired with other &quot;prison&quot; writings (cleaver, malcolm x) can help a non-black person understand the difficulties that black males go through in this society. Two, I teach in a poor neighborhood in NYC and this book helped me understand a lot of the mental stress and strain young children are under. When living amongst an oppressed people, where money/status/power/priviledge/mobility are slim, the tricks and games humans will play on each other to get ahead/survive may seem crazy or illogical to those of us who don't live that life. To those that do, it is real. I was better able to understand the pressures of being black, and the different masks black men wear, by reading this book. Three, this book shows how difficult it can be to turn around from past mistakes/actions, but how one must continue. McCall's life could've turned out so differently. He kept fighting and made it so he could have a &quot;piece of the pie&quot; and actually provide something to his children, and show his parents all their help was not totally lost, and prove to himself that he could do it. He said, after serving three years in prison, that he believed he could do anything if he made it out alive. That belief was tested at times when he went through difficulties at various workplaces, with his women, or in the transition back into society from prison. He even went so far as to think for a second that prison was an easier place to be (monastic) because there he could focus entirely on himself, and all threats were known entities. Four, this book helped me at a time in my life where i felt (feel) the walls are closing in on me. My problems are not so deep as McCall's, but i know what it feels like to feel that there are NO options, or the few you have are all bad, and you must simply do the best you can, keep thinking, keep struggling. This is a story of a spirit unwilling to throw in the towel, determined to carry out the strength that miraculously keeps it alive, striving, growing, despite all odds.<br />I will never forget this book. For those who say it ought to be required reading, I agree. It is an amazingly honest memoir. I'm not disappointed in McCall for not showing &quot;remorse&quot; or appearing contrite about what he's done. He lets his words speak clearly to us, showing us that he has learned from his mistakes, otherwise he'd be unable to sit down and write a book as honest and powerful as this one.astic) because there he could focus entirely on himself, and all threats were known entities.

Besides being a good introduction to how a Zen monastary in Kyoto operates, Empty Mirror is a heartfelt examination of one  man's struggle to find meaning in life, and meaning in his search for  meaning. Anyone who has wandered the path of truth will have had times when  s/he wonders: what is this for? what am I accomplishing? what have I  learned? will this mean anything to anyone but me? what is the larger  meaning?<br />Jan-san (as the author is called by his fellow monks) is totally  honest in his account of his stay in Japan. His monastic life is mixed with  occasional days off visiting brothels and eating food outside the monastary  gates, while within its walls, the monks and master crack jokes, goof off,  watch TV and share cigarettes.<br />Empty Mirror can at times be  disillusioning, but only in the best way possible: the author approaches  his new surroundings and genuine attempts at truth-seeking with that  wonderful Western virtue of skepticism. A quick, memorable book that reads  as much like a novel as it does a memoir.	2000-07-29

I was not disappointed. Her &quot;speculative fiction&quot; contains ideas which are only a few degrees removed from our  current reality. At the rate humanity is evolving, there may come a time in  the future when psychic gifts, immortality, supernatural healing abilities  and astral travel are innate characteristics, as opposed to legend or the  rare, often disputed examples that exist today.<br />In this story, Doro and  Anyanwu, two powerful beings, cross paths. The core story of Wildseed is  the developing and deepening relationship between these two beings, and  their relationships to lesser evolved, but still powerful, beings like  them. Doro &quot;farms&quot; these poweful beings with rare gifts; he  engineers them. Anyanwu just is; she is &quot;wildseed,&quot; and  occasionally out of Doro's control. Although Anyanwu is female and Doro  male, their power, sensitivity, passion, and determination transcend; they  are portraits of the most powerful, the most full, that a human spirit can  be. Seen as metaphors for human spiritual development, Anyanwu and Doro are  the fantasies many of us carry in ourselves, the fantasy of ultimate power,  a power of Creation that borders on the divine.<br />Butler's writing is  strong, supple and gorgeous. She's the type of writer than can turn a  phrase so beautifully, that you'll read it over several times, letting her  insight and creativity sink in. Butler's imagination is wide open. Only a  mind totally open could dream up characters such as these.<br />Although I  haven't read any other Butler books, I did buy &quot;Earthseed&quot; to  read next. Butler's writing is a gift, a magnificent talent that cuts to  the heart of the matter.	2000-07-27

As per the title, Dirty  Laundry has it all: marital problems, abbot/junior initiate sexual  relationships, jealousy and intrigue in the monastery, financial problems,  even the raising of a young child part-time at the monastary, part-time at  home. Dirty Laundry's best quality is its ability to make Buddhist  practice, even monastic practice, seem possible, if not practical. For all  who have considered a retreat or even a longer period of monastic practice,  Dirty Laundry shows what it might be like: the possible problems, possible  solutions, etc. In this respect, it's a valuable book, as it is for taking  the cover off the secrecy of domestic Buddhist practice.<br />However, while  Dirty Laundry does a decent job of showing us the underbelly of monastic  life, the book offers very little detail on the good stuff: practice,  zazen, ritual, even the physical appearance of the monastary. This is  probably due to the fact that the book is actually a journal kept in tandem  by ordained monk Robert Winson and his lay wife, Miriam Sagan. Fully  one-half the entries have little to do with Buddhism at all, except as an  outsider's observation of how it fits into her life (or doesn't, as the  case may be).<br />The squabbles and seemingly un-enlightened behavior that  goes on can be infuriating to those who take their Buddhism a little more  seriously, but Dirty Laundry is quick and easy to read and for its ease of  digestion, offers some insight to the problems facing domestic monastic  practice.	2000-07-26

Full of faith, insight and strength, her dedication to persuing the Path has determined her life and continues to do so. The writer, Vicki  Mackenzie, writes a gripping narrative about Tenzin Palmo's life from her  beginnings in England (where her interest in the East bloomed) to her  voyage to India, to living in a monastary, finding her guru and eventually  going up to her cave, where she meditated for 12 years. The book reaches a  peak in the chapters about Tenzin Palmo's cave retreat. The book changes  directions upon Tenzin Palmo's emergence from the cave, becoming more  reportorial and less biographical. Among the topics covered are Tenzin  Palmo's efforts in founding a nunnery for her lineage (Kargyu) and to  perpatuate the esoteric yogic practices of the Togdenmas, female yogis in  this particular Tibetan line. Also interesting chapters on Buddhism in the  West (particularly the U.S.) and the role of retreat.

The end result  is, or should be, that the student becomes the master, and that the cycle  of learning and growth between master and student is eternal and  self-renewing.<br />There is one narrative quirk that should not affect the  power of the lessons contained herein, but does weaken the book a bit from  a writer's point of view. Otherwise, this is a valuable book, one that  addresses the key relationship between master &amp; student. In the West,  it is common for students to not take their masters as seriously as they  should, and for masters to occaisonally show less responsibility and  accountability than they should. This short volume shows what a balanced,  committed disciple/master relationship might look like.<br />Recommended.	2000-07-26

For the diarist, writer, avid reader or fan of Virginia Woolf, Anais Nin, Alice James, Katherine Mansfield, Marjory Fleming or May Sarton (or just for a lover of great writing!), this is a must-have book. I have kept a  journal for nearly 20 years and have never thought much of it. In other  words, it's part of me like my arm or leg is but in this book, journals are  made into fascinating mirrors (or in some cases, pandora's boxes) of women  writers. The author explains in great detail how each writer used her  journal as a creative tool. The title &quot;hidden writer&quot; is somewhat  misleading, as all the women in this book were published, but the  &quot;hidden&quot; aspect perhaps refers to the private aspects of  themselves they revealed only in their journals. Chapters on Katherine  Mansfield and Virgina Woolf are exceptional.<br />Johnson's research is  phenomenal, layered and her narrative skill at tying it all together is  amazing. Somewhat mediumistic, she dons a slightly different voice in each  chapter, to best bring the writer's diaries to life.<br />The book ends with a  few journal entries from the author.<br />A fascinating, memorable read.  Anyone with an interest in writing, psychology, and creativity should find  this a wonderful read!<br />Recommended without fail!	2000-04-08

I went on to read some of his other works, including &quot;The Desert of  Love.&quot; This work is psychological and personal in nature. If you enjoy  stories which probe characters' minds, this is an excellent choice. An  invalid man lies in bed, dying, remembering his life and coming to terms  with it, and himself. An unknown classic. Also great if you like to collect  obscure literature!	2000-04-08
