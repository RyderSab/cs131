They are fun to try and she even manages to make bok choy and tofu tasty.  There is no \\"diet\\" plan per se, just 8 things you need to kick, like sugar and caffeine.  The first part of the book has her and her boyfriend's nutritional journeys, and those are interesting and informative, and very representative of the kind of \\"you are what you eat\\" tales you read from other reformed adherents of the Standard American Diet.<br /><br />Be warned, though, much of this pastiche of medical details and alarmist nutritional info is cobbled together from less than reputable sources.  What good medical and nutritional advice she does dole out is directly taken from Andrew Weil, David Katz and other MDs or RDs who actually have studied the subject and know how to interpret medical studies.  Jamieson claims that everything in our modern life is killing us, and she joins her voice to the thousands of others in pop-culture who cry for a simpler time, a purer time, a chemical free time... which of course never really existed in this fantasy form because humans were dying of infectious diseases and cholera.  She and her ilk ignore the fact that people are living longer than ever, and now have the diseases of old age and over indulgence.<br /><br />This book address the over indulgence and there is NO QUESTION that you will be healthier and happier if you follow it.  But if you want more substative, and more reliable, medical and nutritional advice, you would be wiser to turn to writers like Andrew Weil, Stephen Gullo, or David Katz.  Weil has an actual 8 week eating plan that offers more guidelines and recipes than this book does, though very similar.	2005-09-10

Stout INVENTS the people she writes about, to sell books.  She probably watched a couple of Law and Order SVUs and figured stories about sociopaths sell ... horror sells ... and it is human nature to think evil thoughts about one's neighbors.  Voila! Write a supposedly academic book about some made up people using a nonsensical technique using \\"composite\\" personalities.  Use made up statistics (4%... oh my!) to make the book scarier and more ... academic.<br /><br />Sure, there are sociopaths.  But a real academic or MD should write about actual cases in terms of diagnostics, treatment and prognosis.  This book is ... well... sociopathic.	2005-08-30

It has an aura of the absurd for the non-academic... these folks take the discourse over this seemingly nonsensical moment in American history VERY seriously indeed.  Linda Tripp, Ken Starr's pornography, the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy, the Meaning of Monica are all explored in a pastiche of Freud, Foucault and Derrida.  Most of the essays are both humorous and academic, and are therefore easy to digest for beleaguered graduate students and tenured types with tired eyes.<br /><br />There is much liberal invective underlying most of the analyses, however, and much sadness over the passing of the progressive liberalism of the 1960s.  Clinton's (Bill, that is) fundamental conservatism is ignored in place of the social meaning of his sexual behavior and the public's reaction to it.  Interestingly, none of the essays analyze the obvious: the sexual entitlement mentality of Southern men or the bizarre reaction of mainstream feminists to the scandal: they vilified the women involved rather than the men, reaffirming their cooption by the \\"ruling classes\\" that feminists for years have claimed affected only conservative sociopaths like Phyllis Schlafly.  The resolution of the impeachment is only briefly touched on ... sadly... since to me that was the most interesting part of the whole drama.<br /><br />There is room, now that time has passed and a new era of social conservatism seems to have ushered in, for further analysis of what exactly the sexual discourse was during the Clinton years and the broader meaning of the impeachment.  I would encourage this same group to follow up Our Monica Ourselves with another volume, eschewing, perhaps, the invective and embracing a more scholarly distance from the subject matter.	2005-03-09

Honestly, I  haven't touched the stuff since I heard that there was a 6th or 7th book out.  I went down that road with Robert Jordan, and...well...thanks but no thanks.  There is only so much I can take, and anyone writing beyond five or six books needs to do us a favor and just cut it out, or divide it up into different series, as David Eddings did in the Belgariad and Mallorean.  Eddings, while not an overly sophisticated writer, at least figured out how not to bore his readers to tears.<br /><br />I agree with earlier reviewers:  Read George R. R. Martin.  Although the series is a long time in completion, it is totally worth it.  Can anyone say amazing?	2005-01-02

The hero is actually a Philip Marlowe knock off, and a very charming one at that.  The novels have the 50's and 60's habit of recycled females: all the women are (very) young, beautiful, and sweetly helpless.  And why not?<br /><br />There is very little tension in the novels, the reader has no doubt that our intrepid hero will off his men in some inventive way.  That he ends up fabulously rich is a given, why should mere money thwart his quest?<br /><br />The only annoying thing about the novels is the obligatory paragraph that Vance inserts in every one about whether or not our hero will be able to adjust to normal life once he succeeds in offing the 5th guy.  NO.  Of COURSE not!<br /><br />All that sniping over with, these are utterly enjoyable sci-fi beach reads.

It is written in an accessible prose that makes complex nutritional advice easy to understand.  It also offers tips on behavioral modification for those individuals who are struggling to lose weight.<br />For those who have been reading this kind of stuff for years, however, I would like to point out that Katz recommends the American nutrition and medical communities' orthodoxy on low - fat, low protein, high-carb diets that is such a source of controversy in the medical community.  We are currently at a nexis of research that may very well debunk much of what mainstream medicine has taught for years about nutrition.<br />So, I would only recommend this book for those who are just beginning their nutritional explorations.  If you have travelled this low protein, low fat road before, and it has not worked for you, you might want to look at the alternative nutritional plans that are making their way into popular culture, like South Beach or Sugar Busters or the Zone.  They offer a real alternative to Katz's, Ornish's and others' low-fat, low protein diets.<br />No one knows at this point, given the knowledge base, which eating method is &quot;best&quot; for optimal weight and long term health.  I would encourage readers to experiment to discover which methods work best on an individual basis.	2004-06-11

That last half (after the  motley crew lands at the icy kingdom of the dragon) feels perfunctory -- as if Hobb wanted to finish the story but knew she needed to put her readers through their paces to do it.<br />This should NOT discourage anyone from reading this book!  Good heavens... if you have slogged through Fitz's suffering and triumphs the least you can do for yourself is read this book to achieve closure.

Johnson is a reformed CIA advisor from Berkeley (of all places) who went off the government dole and saw the light.  He has the vapors about EVERYTHING in modern America, including US military bases, multinational corporations, the balance of trade, the IMF, the World Bank, the military industrial complex and racism.  He sadly omits sexism, the American education guild and short skirts -- I would have really enjoyed his pontification of those subjects.<br />Still ... the book is fun to read, if only for the power that an educated alarmist has over the human heart rate.  If the Illuminati and Freemasons are absent from Johnson's tale, the current Bush administration and multinational corporations/bankers/generals/admirals/assorted Others fill the bill.<br />You won't trust T-bills after reading this.  The only thing left is French Francs.  Oh wait, Euros. Or maybe sesterces... Johnson invokes the Roman Empire ad nauseum, and after a while it starts to seem like the only safe place to invest.	2004-04-27

This book is at least tolerable because it is focused ... shocking but true .... it has a beginning, middle and an end.  It suffers from some of the flaws of the Eye of the World series: it is full of characters (mostly Aes Sedai chicks) who are carbon copies of one another and do nothing to advance the plot; the plot devices are shallow; and the  ending is silly -- in a paragragh Moiraine and Siuan patch together an extraodinary conspiracy.  (Ann Coulter is obviously Aes Sedai.)  Lan is an afterthought in the book, just another puppet of the Tower, albeit a swashbuckling one.<br />But the book does have something that gives me hope, it has some of the charm of the first 4 or 5 books of the series, before Jordan/Oliver started milking it.  The New Spring needs editing badly, but TOR apparently decided that they wouldn't bother years ago.  (the fact that Jordan/Oliver is married to his editor probably has something to do with this.)<br />But here's the deal: the book is fun.  And blessedly free of any Forsaken, who Jordan keeps recycling book after book after book....Which is more than can be said since Lord of Chaos.<br />So go ahead.  Read it.  It won't hurt like Path of Daggers... Winter's Heart... Crossroads.... ouch.  It just hurts to say the titles.	2004-04-27

Both are really upset, both are reasonably witty and neither one is mature enough to give a reasonable view of any of the political view points of the day.<br />Franken and Limbaugh both use the kind of \\"his fly is undone!\\" humor that we all enjoyed in high school -- but since both these guys are in their 50's it is a little alarming.<br />Nevertheless... \\"Liars\\" is an amusing read, just like Limbaugh's musical satires are an amusing listen.  The field remains open for a mature, intelligent individual to actually satirize today's body politic in a way that makes us laugh without wincing.<br />Oh wait.

It also delves into the pains and pleasures of adolescence, especially when a teen is turning out more like the other gender than his own.  A theme of gender bending and soft homosexuality runs through Flewellings other books also -- the problem is, Tobin's transformation to a young woman seems extraordinarily facile.  Not just Tobin/Tamir's acceptance of it, which is given good voice on the pages of the book, but everyone else in the kingdom just sort of rolls with it.  Oh, so you're a girl now?  No problem...hmmm.  Imagine if Hillary Clinton suddenly became Howard.  What would CNBC say?  Or Prince Charles sloughed off his skin and became Charlotte.  Even the BBC might think it was odder than the usual  cross dressing royal moment.<br />Still, a very fun read and a respectable 2nd book in a paperback only series.  I'll definitely pick up the third.  And, among sword&amp;sorcery series, this is #3, after GeoRRMartin's Fire and Ice, and Robin Hobb's Apprentice and Fool series.	2003-08-16

The voice of the narrator, self absorbed and libidinous, is nicely unisexed, so even at the end of the book the reader is still wondering ... though, of course, we know, don't we -- because the London tabs have told us.<br />Still, certainly a lovely bedtime read and a book to share with a lover.	2003-03-29

There is no follow up to Rand's supposed cleansing of the source or anything that the series was originally about.

The Mat backstory barely redeems the book, because it takes 200+ pages to tell what should have taken 20.  <br />It is eerie how checked out the editors at TOR are.

I guess it is romance, in the same genre as those thick novels with a woman and Fabio on the cover.  If one starts this book with that in mind, you won't be disappointed.  It still has Ayla inventing everything and healing everyone, and Jondalar is still an amusingly dumb blond with one endearing attribute.   The animal friends are still there, wowing the prehistoric residents of France.  Auel still manages to make sex scenes tiresome -- singlehandedly she may keep teenagers from having sex because she makes it seem so boring.<br />But a fun bubble-head read nonetheless.

Poorly written, incomprehensible scene  transitions, characters so similar it is impossible to tell them apart.  And the story... the same, old fantasy tale of orphans that find out they  have magical powers and the cabal of rich, powerful baddies out to get  them. YAWN.<br />Huh?  This is a series that people fall in love with?  What  am I missing?	2000-07-18

Just what fantasy and S&amp;S addicts long for when you first begin a series -- a great first book, a better second book and the promise of a third.  My only reservation in recommending this  book would be its graphic sexual and violent content -- the battles are  better than DUNE and the sex is distinctly hard edged.  So okay... don't  let your 8th grader read it.<br />The family saga is beautifully written and  clearly told -- like Richard Adams, Martin's prose makes a movie in the  mind of the reader.  His pace never lags.<br />Highly recommended.	2000-05-21

Tamales, enchiladas, sopa pias and even chips are transformed tastily.  This food is simply low fat, there is no skimping on salt or seasonings.  The recipes  are also flexible == you can add or detract naughty items like cheese and  lard.  The soups are SPLENDID, and the book is worth buying for the chicken  and lime soup recipe.<br />My only negative comment would be that some of the  ingredients are hard to come by, particularly the mexican cheeses and latin  style chocolate.  And I live in New Mexico!	2000-03-27

Nothing like a series to expose the banality of the writer's soul, I guess.  But it is fun to see Paleolithic society portrayed as an evening at Studio 54.  Both social systems are defunct.  Coincidence?  I think not.<br />Ayla will no doubt invent the wheel in the next book.  I'm sorry she ever started.  Someone invented written language and Auel is  threatening to finish the series.  Oh, I hope not.	1999-11-30

I suppose that professional archeologists or anthropologists might quibble with a few points made by the many  contributors, but as a lay person I certainly am finding it a very readable  overview of pre-historic humans.  Well worth the twenty.	1999-11-30

It is clearly written,  if a little disorganized, and recipes are given, though the reader is well  advised NOT TO TRY THIS AT HOME.	1999-11-21
