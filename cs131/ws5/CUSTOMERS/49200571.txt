If even a small amount of this book is true/accurate then Arafat is a pig and the peace process is really nonexistant. Gets alittle bit repetitive near the end (that's why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars), but worth reading.	2003-12-18

This was a textbook for my Secondary Education/History Teacher course. I understood why the author wrote it and why my professor chose it, but could have been better. Kincheloe raises some interesting points, but goes off on too topics. Verbous is an understatement. Worth taking a look at, but certainly not THE text.	2003-09-24

I enjoyed this candid and controversial argument by Rabbi Lapin. Why is being a &quot;Conservative&quot; and a Jew, impossible? I'm a Jew and it bothers me that I could be an atheist and find more love from fellow Jews than embracing &quot;Conservative/Republican&quot; idealogies/politics. This book really makes you think about the American Jewish population and how the Liberal Left has said that the vast number of Jews equates that this is what Judaism really is, excepting of others. Practicing a religion is not about being the same, it is about being disciplined. IT'S NOT EASY BEING TRADITIONAL/RELIGIOUS!	2001-04-13
