Mencken	Books	4	3	6	N	N	Larger Than Life Bio of Legendary Cynical Newspaperman	He was the cantankerous, stogie-smoking \\"Voice of the Jazz Age,\\" though personally, he hated jazz.  The most influential literary and social critic of his time, he made household names of such now-renowned authors as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair lewis, Joseph Conrad, Willa Cather, Theodore Dreiser, Dorothy Parker and James M. Cain.  He transformed the Baltimore Sun into a first-rate newspaper as ediotr-in-chief, and brought it national recognition through his tongue-in-cheek reportage and editorials.  He first made the observation \\"Those who can do; those who can't, teach\\" and coined the sobriquet \\"Bible Belt.\\"  Even today, the reverberations of his caustic wit resound through such diverse writers as historian William Manchester, \\"Gonzo\\" journalist Hunter S. Thompson on the left and libertarian humorist P.J. O'Rourke on the right. <br /> <br />Yet, despite his vast influence on American letters, H.L. Mencken is virtually unknown to most American readers today. <br /> <br />Over the course of the past decade, thankfully, Terry Teachout has been doing a yeoman's task in helping return many of Mencken's works back onto bookshelves, beginning with 1995's \\"A Second Mencken Chrestomathy.\\" The Second Chrestomathy -- comprised of the author's hand-picked reviews, columns and miscellany -- lay forgotten in boxes in the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore until discovered by Teachout, who then edited it into book form. This recent biography by Teachout has thrust Mencken's name and notorious reputation back into the spotlight. <br /> <br />Henry Louis Mencken first emerged as the real H.L. Mencken in the late 1910s on the pages of his magazines \\"The Smart Set\\" and \\"The American Mercury.\\" In them, he wrote as he spoke, in an unusual mixture of intellectual discourse -- seasoned to taste with Stammtisch German and scholarly Latin and Greek -- woven together with American street slang. Its effect was both outrageous and infectious: He used it to roil against frauds, quacks, mountebanks, Rotarians, uplifters, Ku-Kluxers, morons and the American middle class, which he labelled \\"the booboisie.\\" He once quipped, \\"No one ever went broke misunderestimating the intelligence of the American public.\\" In this age of lip-sync'd pop music and contrived \\"reality\\" television programming, this observation is just as prescient as ever. <br /> <br />Through Mencken was probably the most well-read intellectual of his generation, he also liked being a fly on the wall, listening to the pungent language of the rough and brassy people he ran across in speakeasies, brothels and night courts. For Mencken, the American language was markedly different from its mother tongue, and in 1921 published \\"The American Language,\\" a huge volume devoted to the unique Americanisms he collected since his early days in journalism. Teachout thoroughly establishes Mencken's importance to the preservation and legitimization of a disctinctly American tongue. <br /> <br />At the height of his popularity, in 1925, Mencken covered the famous Scopes \\"Monkey\\" trial (as he dubbed it) for the Baltimore Sun. Mencken had no qualms mocking proseutor William Jennings Bryan, a former Democrat presidential nominee whom he thought a demogogue who played to mob prejudice. To the atheist Mencken, the trial was a battle between science and religion, between the literate North and the ignorant South. Scopes was found guilty (but only fined $100), but Mencken became a household name and burned in effigy throughout the South. <br /> <br />Teachout also deals with Mencken's anti-Semitism. True, Mencken was predisposed to be against religion in general (which he regarded as childish superstition), but in revealing correspondence which evinces some of Mencken's less than honorable treatment of even Jews close to him (such as his publisher Alfred A. Knopf and literary critic and co-editor George Jean Nathan), Mencken is found wanting.  Some of this Teachout ascribes to Mencken's native sense of German superiority, and some to his lack of sentiment beyond a certain point. But what Teachout finds most damning is Mencken's silence during World War II. Far from painting Mencken as a Nazi sympathizer, Teachout instead saw Mencken as so cynical that he not only could not see good in mankind, but neither could he spot evil. <br /> <br />Mencken's star faded during the 1930's, the \\"Red Decade.\\" Teachout draws a sympathetic portrait of Mencken in his later years, writing his memoirs, and editing collections of his essays. Mencken suffered a stroke in 1948 that left him unable to engage in the two activities most central to his very being, reading and writing. <br /> <br />H.L. Mencken died in 1956, at 1524 Hollins Street, Baltimore, in the house of his birth, which he regarded \\"as much a part of me as my own two hands.\\" From his upstairs office there, the man whom Edmund Wilson called \\"our greatest practicing literary journalist\\" pounded out a legacy on his portable Corona typewriter, with just his two index fingers, that still reads as juicy, poignant and vitriolic as when it first came hot off the presses.	2005-01-21

Die knowing something. You are not here long.\\" -- Walker Evans, c. 1960, from the afterword. <br /> <br />Thank God for Jeff L. Rosenheim, associate curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Due to his prodigious efforts, no less than five volumes of Walker Evans' best work -- much of it neglected, or previously unpublished -- have been published under Rosenheim's editorship in a little over a decade. The most notable of these have been: A thorough omnibus of Evans's photographs, with essays by current critics and scholars published by the Metropolitan; a collection of Evans' writings, translations and correspondence, and; a collection of Evans' Polaroid photographs, which he produced in the early 1970s, shortly before his death in 1975. <br /> <br />\\"Many Are Called\\" is the first book Rosenheim edited that is a reissue of a previously released book. Originally released in 1966, this collection of 89 photographs taken by Evans in New York City's subways between 1938 and 1941 marks the return of this seminal work in its entirety after many decades out of print. <br /> <br />Along with James Agee's original introduction is a newly written preface by Luc Sante, which basically says in more updated and professorial language what Agee said.  Rosenheim penned an afterword for this new edition, which relates the history of this work's genesis and its quarter-century dormancy before its first publication in 1966. <br /> <br />New plates have been engraved from scans made from Walker Evans' original negatives. They are attractively printed in duotone. Although the printing is considerably better in tonality than the original, halftone screening and slight pixilization resultant from digital scanning is evident to the careful eye. <br /> <br />Many readers will already be familiar with many of the plates herein, published in previous collections such as the one cited above and also prominently featured in Gilles Mora's \\"Walker Evans: The Hungry Eye.\\"  <br /> <br />Upon first seeing these photographs, I was struck by how these were a departure from Evans' earlier work, most notably his \\"American Photographs.\\" Because of its surreptitious nature (Evans kept a Contax folding camera hidden in his overcoat), the look of his subway portraits is stripped down to its bare elements: Slightly out of focus, grainy because it was in 35mm rather than large format, and somewhat off-kilter framing (Evans never looked through a viewfinder, using a cable release hidden up his sleeve to trip the shutter). Many subway riders have been framed in a subtle halo of light, resulting from the naked incandescent bulbs in train stations refracting through the camera's lens, accidentally giving his subjects an angelic aura. <br /> <br />Yet, because of this anonymous shooting method, Evans was able to keep capture his subjects totally unawares. To Evans, this represented portraiture in its purest, unadulterated and totally ingenuous state. Because of their anonymity, his subjects have been unmasked, and are simply in transit between work and home, on their way to the movies, reading the paper in their hands (always a tabloid, never a gatefold -- fitting, for the tabloid was invented to accomodate the confines of the packed subway car). Some were caught staring up. (At toothpaste ads? At a pretty girl's lithe arm hanging from an overhead strap? Who knows?) <br /> <br />My favorite print is probably the most famous, of a comely Jewish girl, magazine in hand, her head topped by a hat's wide, round, brim, her shoulders elegantly wrapped in a voluminous fur. <br /> <br />Others, though, are more comical, iconic or ironic: Plate 5 shows an older gentleman, grimacing, his eye's closed; a pair of old ladies gab in profile (plate 27); a blue collar guy gets caught up, ethusiastically reading his Daily Mirror (31); a prim and properly dressed elderly woman finds something on thetrain quite un-prim and improper to laugh out loud at (34); a man yawns, his mouth wide open (44); a pin-up girl on the Chesterfield cigarette placard slyly peers over a sailor's shoulder, betraying him as more lonely than alone (83); an accordion player ambles between the rows of passengers, singing his song, his eyes closed and oblivious to the passengers' aloofness (89). <br /> <br />In 2002, the great landscape photographer Ansel Adams had his birthday celebrated from beyond his grave by all sorts of his hangers-on, the usual crowds from the Sierra Club, the Yosemite workshops and PBS. It was a fitting tribute, a larger-than-life gushing forth of accolades and genuflection that would have pleased the professional publicity seeking cameraman. <br /> <br />The next year, however, marked the centenary of another great photographer, Walker Evans. Yet, there was little fanfare. This was also quite fitting, in its own way. Nonetheless, this quiet and fastidious man has probably had an influence greater than any other on the photography of the past 50 years. <br /> <br />In contrast to the bigger-than-a-breadbox boxed edition of \\"Ansel Adams at 100,\\" there was no \\"Walker Evans at 100\\" released in 2003. However, this belated volume is a most fitting volume to the greatest photographic collector of prosaic American ephemera. In 89 plates, Evans created a revolution in documentary photography. Seeking not to convince, interpret, preach or incite. Rather, he  achieves that rarest and most precious of photographic aspirations: He permits the world to simply see the world as he has seen it through his own eyes.  <br /> <br />There's nothing necessarily novel about that in itself. Yet, what makes this work so singular and powerful is that we not only see through Evans' eyes, we like what we see, are moved by it and what we've seen is indelibly imprinted within our minds' eyes. <br /> <br />Anybody can make such miracles of nature as Momument Valley, the Grand Tetons or Half-dome at Yosemite beautiful. Walker Evans, though, took the ordinary and common, and raised it to something unique and profound through his taste, imagination and artistic passion.	2005-01-09

Italian-born, Modotti emigrated to the United States, and then to Mexico, during which time she had an extended affair with famed photographer Edward Weston, for whom Modotti also modeled for his nude studies. Partially through Weston's influence, model and actress Tina turned her talents to photography, and the world has been better for it. <br /> <br />Because of her contact with other artists in Mexico, including Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, Modotti's photographic interests spread far afield. Thus, while her work lacks the singular vision of Weston's, her shrugging the cloak of purism revealed instead a versatile photographer and artist. Personally, I find her work more enjoyable than Weston's, though her career was much more short-lived. <br /> <br />Unfortunately for the world, political unrest and circumstances forced her to flee to Soviet Russia. An avowed communist, Modotti   spent her time after 1931 helping political dissidents throughout Europe and later aided the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. Because the rigid Stalinist regime had no use for her highly-stylized photography, she put her camera down upon arriving in Russia and never picked it up again. <br /> <br />In 1939, she slipped back into Mexico, from which she had been forcibly exiled, but in early 1942, died of a purported heart attack, just as she was planning to resume her photography. <br /> <br />Many of Modotti's photographs would be regarded as \\"derivative\\" by some of today's more  cynical critics. Examples include plates of Jean Charlot, 1924 (reminiscent of August Sander), Roses, 1925  (see painter Georgia O'Keefe), Police puppets, 1929 (Man Ray),  Mella's typewriter, 1928 (Albert Renger-Patzsch), and Wine Glasses, 1925 (Laszlo Moholy-Nagy). Modotti's photographs themselves are nonetheless strikingly graphic and uniformly excellent. <br /> <br />Other photographs in this book, particularly here women of Tehuantepec bear her stamp alone, and her photographs of Mexican laborers and sundry elements of the social landscape, such as  photographs of telephone wires and posters predate work in a similar vein by Walker Evans. Clearly, Modotti was quite an influence on the quintessential American photographer. <br /> <br />If only Modotti had been a greedy capitalist instead of a selfless communist, then she would have left so much more material for posterity. As it stands, though, her body of work is  a testament to a great creative mind.	2004-12-19

Buckley, Jr.'s magazine, National Review. It has been a reasoned voice for American conservatism, and indeed a guiding light that helped launch the Reagan revolution. I have also been a longtime fan of the novels of Russian-born American novelist Ayn Rand, and a serious student of her philosophy, Objectivism. There: That's my disclaimer.    \\"Getting It Right\\" is a historical novel that spans a crucial decade for the conservative movement, from 1956 through 1966, and is told through its protagonists, two anti-communists who fall in love. One, Woodroe Raynor, is a staffer for the John Birch Society. Mormon Woodroe is involved with a (non-practicing, obviously) Jewish \\"student of Objectivism,\\" Leonora Goldstein, who works as an assistant for Barbara Branden, erstwhile second-in-line to Ayn Rand's throne as Philosopher Queen and head of state of Galt's Gulch.    However, \\"protagonists\\" does not exactly describe Woodroe and Leonora. Tristan und Isolde they ain't. Actually, \\"props\\" more aptly captures the essence of the novel's two main characters. Throughout the novel, the pair serve as two remote controlled cyborgs that puppet master Buckley navigates expertly through the inner-workings of paranoid Birch founder Robert Welch's movement and his co-conspiracy theorist Gen. Edwin Walker and Rand's \\"Collective,\\" a group of freewheeling individualists who strangely become automatons under the spell of Ayn Rand, whom Buckley has cast as The Bride of Dr. Mabuse.    Basically, the plot of the book is simple: How William Buckley, National Review and Young Americans for Freedom rushed in on a white steed at the last minute and saved the conservative movement -- hanging by a pinky from a cliff overlooking a crevass -- from the clutches of evil madman Welch and heretical witchdoctress Ayn.    \\"Getting it Right\\" is actually entertaining, once you get past the two non-entities Woody and Lee. Buckley has obviously been saving juicy tidbits ofright-winger gossip for almost a half century and can finally divulge them all now that the interested maligned parties (Rand, her passive husband Frank O'Connor, Welch, Walker and radical scholar Revilo Oliver) have had their mail forwarded to St. Peter's pearly gates (Petrogate, for the atheist Rand).    Cameo appearances are made by Barry Goldwater, Jack and Bobby Kennedy, Ike Eisenhower, Lyndon Baines Johnson, Alan Greenspan and various second-stringer conservatives who wrote for National Review, who act as stand-ins so that Buckley can take vicarious credit without appearing too boorish.    Much of the book's plot centers around Arizona Republican Senator Barry Goldwater's 1964 run for the White House and his crisis of having to dissociate himself from the John Birchers. Yes, it is true that Welch was a big obstacle to moving the conservative movement forward, but Rand?    The Objectivists were never more than a speed bump at worst, and actually had a much longer-lasting impact on Republican politics in particular and conservatism in general. By equating the bizarre paranoid fantasies of Robert Welch with the eccentric sexual antics of Ayn Rand, Buckley's 45- year-long chip on his shoulder against the author of \\"The Fountainhead\\" and \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is revealed (he's been sore at Rand ever since she told him he was too intelligent a man to believe in God). For a man who should now rest on his laurels as the legitimate Elder Statesman of conservatism, Buckley spends an inordinate amount of time nursing a childish grudge.    Oddly, Buckley never even mentions the one man responsible for making the abrasive and rugged Goldwater palatable to the American people, Ronald Reagan. It was Reagan's nationally televised populist speech that did more for Goldwater than patrician Buckley and his coterie ever did by heading off Welch and Rand at the pass.    Buckley's omission may have been excusable had Reagan never done anything more than boost Goldwater's popularity. However, the fact that the pinnacle and culmination of all the hopes, wishes and efforts of conservatives was Reagan's election in 1980, shows Buckley's as more ungracious than forgetful.    Mostly, \\"Getting it Right\\" gets it wrong in narrowing the scope of its focus, overlooking the larger impact of the then-nascent conservative movement.	2004-12-08

Not wanting to show up there a total ignoramus (like the man said, \\"When in Rome...\\"), so I bought this book and devoured it. When I showed up at my duty station in Heilbronn, I was able to get by pretty well, and after another couple weeks, I found my accent getting better. The German phonetic pronunciations are very good, and I was able to be understood by Schwabians and Ostfriesians alike.<br /><br />After I was there a few weeks, I was required to enroll in the Army's German Headstart program, a one-week class to learn common German phrases, such as asking traffic directions and how to order from a German menu.  There was not one question I did not know the answer to, and when called upon, I was able to answer intuitively. The teacher asked me how I learned German so well, and I told her that I had been studying the Berlitz Self-Teacher for a couple months. She remarked that she had run across many soldiers who learned to speak conversational German by studying this excellent book.<br /><br />What makes the Berlitz Self-Teacher the best primer for learning German I ever had is that it is methodical and deals with everyday conversation.

(Do people make the complaint about Hemingway that its English is 50 years out of vogue, or is he recognized still as the great wordsmith and scribe that he was?)<br /><br />Further, the Berlitz method gives you enough basic vocabulary to understand the language and once you get halfway through it, the rest will come to you by assimilating words and phrases you are now able to understand from being among the people, watching TV (or, \\"Telewision\\" or \\"Tee Wee\\" as some Germans call it) or reading the newspapers.<br /><br />I also like that it teaches in the formal (\\"Sie\\") rather than the familiar (\\"Du\\") sense.

US	42160210	R3Q5OVLVYHESOP	0316733628	724756401	Civil War and Reconstruction	Books	5	32	40	N	N	A Thorough and Reliable History of the American Civil War	Students of history would do well to begin their studies of the U.S. Civil War by reading this seminal historical text by renowned historian James Garfield Randall (1881-1953), University of Illinois professor and Lincoln biographer. Released in 1937, \\"The Civil War and Reconstruction\\" was revised by Randall's student David Herbert Donald in 1961. This is the book we are dealing with, not the further revised volume outlined in the product description.    What distinguishes this work is Randall's keen sense of historical accuracy: Although he had his own predilictions (Abraham Lincoln was his childhood hero and lifelong subject of his scholarship), he separated his early personal views from his assessment of the historical record. Anyone who has ever read books on the Civil War written before Randall's will find enough jingoism, hyperbole and finger pointing to suffice them a lifetime. What Randall aspired to, however, was a more objective and scientific analysis of history. In that, I believe, he has succeeded.    Written in an era before political correctness, this book deals with the issue of slavery honestly and forthrightly. Randall looks into the economics of slavery from Colonial times up to the Civil War, and gives a dispassionate sketch of its origins and practices. For example, consider these simple facts: That unlike the pale white indentured servants from the British Isles, who were generally physically ill equiped for working the soil in the hot and humid Southern states, African slaves were much better acclimated to the South's punishing climate, and, in fact, received better treatment than their European counterparts. The reason for this was purely economic, not altruistic: Slaves were owned, and represented a financial investment, whereas indentured servants more or less were leased and were driven hard so that plantation owners could extract every penny of value from them while they could. Yet, when I voiced these facts in a graduate school lecture hall in New York City in the early 1990s, many students glowered at me, and the professor looked like a scared rabbit, and changed the subject immediately.    What makes Randall's study of the Civil War most appealing is that although he began his career seeing the Union through rose-colored glasses (given his admiration for Lincoln) one sees that after studying the matter thoroughly, his sympathies often lie with the South, and that he regards Lincoln as a sort of tragic figure, who was torn between holding the Union together and keeping more radical elements of the Republican Congress at bay. This is significant, because it is seldom that scholars admit they are wrong.    His thesis, that the Civil War was indeed not inevitable, ought to be carefully studied by purveyors of the two prevailing -- and ignorant -- explanations of the Civil War and Lincoln's place in it. To those Southerners who declare that the Civil War was not about slavery, Randall provides copious evidence to debunk that myth. Yes, while it is true the war was not *exclusively* about slavery, Randall shows that slavery was indeed the crucible through which radicals of both sides eventually wound up taking arms against each other. He holds radical abolitionists such as John Brown and cynical Yankees as Stephen Douglas (more concerned with building a transcontinental railroad through the industrial north, partly at the expense of Southern taxation) in equal disdain. A simple study of the breakoff of the West Virginians from Virginia illustrates the concept of two economically separated nations.    Another naive, yet dangerous, view that Randall dispells is the gripe often voiced by leftists that Lincoln was no hero for ending slavery, because his primary objective was holding the Union together, even if it meant keeping slavery intact. That view drops context just as readily as does the aforementioned Southern view. According to Randall, Lincoln was a voice of moderation in the Republican party, nota rabid abolitionist. Lincoln knew that slavery could never be ended immediately without war, and indeed tried to prevent it. Randall's telling of the election of 1860 showed that while Lincoln's more moderate platform of compromise and consensus made it possible to have a mandate in the North, deep divisions within the Democrat party further exacerbated Southern suspicions that the Northerners had it in for them. The nomination of Illini Douglas caused the South to field their own candidate, John Breckenridge. John C. Bell, a pro-South candidate who wished to see the Union preserved, tried -- like Lincoln -- to appeal to calmer emotions, but made little impact. The election ended with a nation deeply divided, and though Lincoln was considered a moderate in his native North, Southerners -- who wound up with the short end of the stick from the Missouri Compromise and the Kansas-Nebraska Act -- viewed Lincoln as the veritable embodiment of abolition.     Thus, according to the politically correct, Lincoln was no puritan on this issue, and therefore of suspect motivation. In fact, though, he did represent the best practical hope of ending slavery, through attrition, rather than the hotheaded clash of swords.    Likewise does Randall paint a rational picture of Reconstruction, more informed by economics and sociology than partisan fury. I commend this volume to anyone who wants to read a well-researched and reasoned account of the Civil War. I find, on balance, Randall's attempts at objectivity to be quite fruitful.  For those who 139 years later are still re-fighting the war with vitriolic fervor, they will find little in this tome to stir up spiteful emotions, pro or con. Such types will nevertheless regard Randall either as a Yankee apologist for Abe Lincoln or a pro-Southern closeted racist.    Although thoughtfully appended with excellent photographs, maps and illustrations, I additionally recommend Bruce Catton's \\"American Heritage Picture History of the Civil War\\" as a fun and informative companion general history of the American Civil War and Reconstruction.	2004-11-25

Mondale got stomped by incumbent Republican Ronald Reagan, losing every state except his own.    * - Following in the footsteps of his hero, Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, Lincoln played baseball for the....    ....Wait a minute.

However, I wish I weren't sometimes, and this is one of them: AC/DC is a band of legendary status, and I don't want anyone out there to think I'm busting their chops. <br /> <br />That said, I cannot agree with all the reviewers who rated this with 5 stars, and saw this album as the antithesis of their mid-'80s slump. I liked their trio of excellent albums from that period (in order, \\"Flick of the Switch,\\" \\"Blow Up Your Video\\" and \\"Fly on the Wall\\"). I really think that \\"The Razor's Edge\\" belongs with \\"Fly on the Wall,\\" truthfully: There are some really excellent songs on this album, but there's the matter of a wee bit too much filler. <br /> <br />First, let us deal with what makes this album work: The title track is total killer and starts off with a nice \\"Bach rock\\" solo on the part of Angus. \\"Thunderstruck\\" and \\"Moneytalks\\" are two superior tunes that indeed announce to the world that AC/DC has not rolled over and played dead, that they doeth still the world rule. \\"Moneytalks\\" hearkens back to the Bon Scott era kind of songs you heard on \\"High Voltage,\\" \\"Let There Be Rock\\" and \\"Highway to Hell.\\" Really clever ditty, that. <br /> <br />I am also glad to hear Brian Johnson's voice in the forefront, whereas with \\"Blow Up Your Video\\" and \\"Fly On the Wall,\\" he sounded as though he was miked from across the room. His voice is a bit more scratchy here than on previous outings, but I like that bluesy, gravelly quality. <br /> <br />\\"Shot of Love\\" is my favorite on this album. It has a cool backbeat and Brian Johnson spits out the lyrics cantankerously. \\"Are You Ready\\" is a great party and drinking song and makes for an excellent stadium-rousing anthem. <br /> <br />\\"Mistress for Christmas\\" is a nice novelty tune, but if the song's subject were less, shall we say, specialized, it would just be another filler track. <br /> <br />However, I am not convinced that this album really does set AC/DC apart from their mid-to-late '80s stuff: I challenge anyone to show that \\"Fire Your Guns,\\" \\"Rock Your Heart Out,\\" \\"Got You by the Balls,\\" \\"Let's Make It,\\" \\"Goodbye and Good Riddance to Bad Luck\\" and \\"If You Dare\\" are anything save a recycling of their '80s filler songs. That's SIX songs that are arguably filler, and if you compare them to the non-hits on \\"Back In Black\\" such as \\"Have a Drink on Me\\" and \\"Shake A Leg,\\" or \\"For Those About to Rock.....\\"'s \\"Inject the Venom\\" and \\"C.O.D.\\", they are not nearly as unique or solid. <br /> <br />That, and Chris Slade's by-the-book drumming do not for an unassailable classic make. Their true comeback album, headlined by the return of original drummer Phil Rudd, would not happen for another five years, until 1995's \\"Ballbreaker.\\"	2004-09-20

I used to enjoy his MSNBC program, hearing his crystal  clear and caustic barbs, his populist message and his most learned opinions on legal cases circulating at the time. Most importantly, he was one of the few on the left who saw the massacre of the Branch Davidians at Waco for the brutal and horrific slaughter at the hands of Janet Reno that it was. <br /> <br />That is what the world needs most: Honest men and women, who don't flinch from the truth when the truth happens to gore oxen on their side of their political fence. Like the land from which he hails, Gerry Spence brims over with the pioneer spirit: Rough and rugged, independent and erudite, full of common sense and plain decency, he is a man more at home in the 19th than the 20th century (never mind the weak and effete \\"metrosexual\\" wussies of this 21st century). <br /> <br />One could call this book \\"The Memoirs of the Last Real Man.\\" Though his photography is traditionalist, somewhat akin to the formalistic work of Ansel Adams, the vision is singularly Spence's. A labor of love, a visual celebrating of the artist's solitary homeland, one can sense that where most men see only barren badlands, Spence sees splendrous vistas, touched by the hand of the Creator.  <br /> <br />Although his photographs are bold, they are yet quiet and bare the soul of a man who's quite comfortable in his own skin. They are simple, yet powerful, documents of a land upon which man is but a temporal, fleeting presence. The permanance of the land is the only constant.  <br /> <br />Thus are his most interesting landscapes not one's purely of nature, but of the fragile hand of man before the inevitability of nature's supremacy: Abandoned dwellings, out-of-business gas stations, empty granaries are but shadows of their former bustling selves. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. <br /> <br />His portraits do not overlook this truth; the few humans portrayed in this text are part and parcel of the land -- a cowboy, a mountaineer, a modern-day Annie Oakley, a Shoshoni Indian. These are not people who are enslaved by the claustrophobic office cubicle.  <br /> <br />Thus does Spence write in the poem \\"The People Are the Landscape\\":  <br /> <br />The people are the landscape, <br />The woman on the county grader <br />Plowing out the last of last winter's snow <br />The wild crying Shoshoni dancing, <br />His days not done <br />The shepherd by his wagon <br />Lost in a landscape of bleeting, <br />Old faces furrowed in the sun. <br />Their faces are the landscape, <br />Their faces, the land, <br />Hard and honest, <br />With no pretensions in the morning. <br /> <br />Absent is the didactic, pedantic hectoring of the man-hating environmentalists; Spence understands intuitively the American Indian conception that man is part of the Earth, and that before he returns to the Earth, that his place is properly living in harmony with the Earth, for the Earth is his grandmother. <br /> <br />This book, though by a celebrity attorney, is the furthest thing from the vapid and glitzy world of celebrity. It is the work of a man alone, relating through his eyes and mind how nature and man have moved him. In awe, to tears, with laughter.	2004-09-14
US	42160210	RW2RAGXB6HN0	0571201628	283335044	Conversations with Billy Wilder	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Too Much Crowe; Not Enough Wilder	Cameron Crowe does a great job of getting Billy Wilder to \\"open up,\\" for certain. There was many interesting anecdotes and facts I previously did not know, so this book is the page-turner everyone proclaims it to be. Crowe does a good job at kibbitzing an answer out of the somewhat stubborn Wilder. However -- since Crowe consciously based the format of this book on the Hitchcock/Truffaut interviews of 1966 -- it is lacking in certain areas.  <br /> <br />Firstly, many of the photographs are horribly transferred stills from the movies, which were taken from video, not film. The pixelization is sometimes so horrible as to wipe out almost half of the information. As there are many more photos done by this makeshift method (most of the others are publicity stills or of Wilder, Hollywood movie stars, etc, not from the actual movies), it would seem to me that the publisher (not some dinky independent, but Alfred A. Knopf, major player over here) could have gone the extra mile and made some high-quality stills from the studios' answer prints. Since they didn't, however, this volume appears \\"rushed to market.\\" <br /> <br />Second, Crowe's organization is horrible: Unlike Hitch/Truffaut, it sort of meanders from movie to movie and then back again. It's organized chronologically (by interview session, not movie), and often goes back over movies already discussed, because Crowe forgot some question or another. Also, Crowe doesn't go much into the bit players and character actors at all. I mean, HOW COULD HE GO AN ENTIRE VOLUME ON BILLY WILDER WITHOUT EVER MENTIONING SIG RUMAN (who was to Wilder as Leo G. Carroll was to Hitch) or Cliff Osmond? <br /> <br />Perhaps, it's because Crowe spends more time dropping the name \\"Jerry Maguire\\" every other page or so (as long as he was shamelessly self-plugging, why not \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High,\\" a much better movie?). Tom Cruise -- who's never been in a Wilder movie -- is listed in 10 different pages in the index. Also (unlike Truffaut) Crowe goes to great lengths in order to insert himself into the text, including going over a house call by Wilder's doctor, a lunch with Wilder and his wife, phone calls Wilder is taking , etc. (in Hollywood, these are called \\"gratuitous scenes\\"). <br /> <br />Lastly, the end notes list (with big backdrops of those horrible pictures from VHS) the credits, but they are very incomplete, and don't list most of the technicians or supporting cast. <br /> <br />All-in-all this book is very good, but heavy editing is needed to give it a semblance of chronology, and Crowe's gratuitous and voluminous self-referencing really could do with a ruthless editor's red pen. That, and some quality stills, would have made a good read a classic.	2004-09-12
US	42160210	RDCL0X0LUET44	0812693906	127294983	The Ayn Rand Cult	Books	3	17	34	N	N	Great film-noir shtick	Here's some background: I Was a Teenage Objectivist! I loved the novels and essays of Ayn Rand, and followed them to such an extent that I could have been called an Objectivist.           Nonetheless -- and perhaps being stationed with the Army in Germany, rather than being an acolyte at the Ayn Rand Institute in Orange County, has a lot to do with it -- what I got most from Objectivism was a thirst for knowledge, and an insatiable appetite for books by thinkers of all stripes. Because of Rand, I branched out, reading works by writers and intellectuals such as Aristotle, Eric Hoffer, Jacques Barzun, Carl Jung, H.L. Mencken, Bertrand Russell, Sinclair Lewis, Baruch Spinoza, and -- surprise -- even Immanuel Kant. I even plowed through lots of Mickey Spillane and Ian Fleming to pass the time. <br /> <br />Needless to say, I came out of it with a broadened mind, and revised my self-categorization to small-'o' objectivist. By the late 1980s, when Barbara and Nathaniel Branden's biographical tomes came out, I did not suddenly feel betrayed, or that my Great Leader was somehow less than perfect. On the other hand, I did profoundly feel sorry for Rand and her followers, regretting the sordid mess into which the official Objectivist movement devolved. <br /> <br />Fast forward to the year 2000, by which time I regarded myself as an independent thinker, no longer an Objectivist nor objectivist, but one more in sympathy with the general ideas of Objectivism and less in sympathy with the pixilated lifestyles of Objectivists. I then picked up this potboiler by Jeff Walker, and devoured all its juicy tidbits of gossip and the \\"he-said/she-said\\" banter that comprises the main crux of its evidence. Doubtless, most of the anecdotes in it ring true, though through further reading, I've come to the conclusion that they're \\"enhanced\\" versions of the truth, spiced up to make for a more entertaining read. <br /> <br />Personally, I think that Rand would've LOVED this book! It's got all the best elements of one of her favorite genres of fiction, the detective novel. Reading it, I think that Rand would have been honored by the appropos typecasting that Walker seems to have given this book, which is on-par with any of James M. Cain's hard-boiled pulp thrillers. <br /> <br />I can see the accompanying theatrical trailer to the movie version of this book playing in my mind's eye: <br /> <br />SEE! A woman torn between an unmentionable love and her devoted <br />husband! A woman so smart, it took a pantheon of Greek navel-gazers to match her in philosophical profundity! <br /> <br />SEE! A social movement leader with the bark of a Union rep and the bite of a loanshark! <br /> <br />SEE! The troubled young boy who pined for the aloof woman of his <br />dreams, all the while hiding the shameful secret of a love that dare not speak its name! <br /> <br />It's the all-time rocker shocker to hit the screen since \\"Double <br />Indemnity,\\" Warner Bros. masterpiece \\"THE AYN RAND CULT\\" (Directed by Michael Curtiz). <br /> <br />JOAN CRAWFORD stars in the performance of her career as the sultry, cigarette-holder wielding philosopher that could make men's blood boil! <br /> <br />EDWARD G. ROBINSON fills the screen as Nathan Branden, a man who ruled the lecture circuit empire with an iron fist, and attended to Ayn's every whim with a velvet glove! <br /> <br />RAY MILLAND as Ayn's forgotten husband Frank, a man so felled by failure that he sees life through the bottom of a whiskey glass! Life is a permanent Long Weekend for forlorn Frank! <br /> <br />OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND makes her return to the screen as Nathan's wife Barbara, an emotionally frigid woman who stands by as Ayn steals her man. Meanwhile, a fire starts flickering as she begins a back-alley dalliance with a dance teacher that turns into a scorching bonfire! <br /> <br />You liked FARLEY GRANGER as Guy in Hitchcock's \\"Strangers On a Train.\\" You'll love him as Leonard, the sensitive young philosophy majorwith a thirst for knowledge and a hidden love for his Liberace-like mentor! <br /> <br />(Dialogue): NATHAN: Whattya take me for, a sap? The Institute is mine, see? Yeah. I got 'em lining around the block; Whatta you ever done for them except dishing out a smooth line of monkey talk and batting those bushy eyebrows at them? You just sit on that dais, toots and keep doling out that line about \\"social metaphysics.\\" I *run* this operation, see? <br /> <br />AYN (Her shoulders hunched under her mink cape, but still protruding from her neck at 90-degree angles because of her shoulder pads, which she got after an affair with Vince Lombardi): You can't take the love of my students away from me! And you won't ditch me for some mealy-mouthed little tramp, who can't open her mouth except to wax eloquently about that mediocre hack, Thomas Wolfe! I'll ruin you! You can't leave me! Even if I were 80 years old and in a wheelchair, I'd MAKE you love me!!! (Slaps Nathan across cheek with the flash of her <br />five-carat diamond ring, leaving bloody gouges across his cheek). <br /> <br />NATHAN: (Trembling in anger, his eyes bulge until he looks like an exploding frog). Why, you filthy tramp! (Pulls a .45 on Ayn, levelling it square at her belly). <br /> <br />AYN: (Gasps, aghast). Damn you!!!! <br /> <br />SEE! The sordid, violent goings on inside a world too unmentionable to speak of, of forbidden love -- and hate! -- that would turn Tom Hobbes into a weak-willed Rousseau! Take a look -- if you can stomach it! -- inside...... <br /> <br />THE AYN RAND CULT (A Jerry Wald Production) <br /> <br />I wish I were exagerating, but that's basically Walker's text, as put on celluloid. <br /> <br />His chapter on Alan Greenspan is particularly ludicrous, as it seeks to debunk Greenspan's financial acumen based mostly on opinion. Yet, Greenspan's record of achievement stands for all to see: His policies at the Fed have kept the economy relatively strong and at an even keel through four presidencies. <br /> <br />This volume about a dizzy dame bent on taking over the philosophy racket ranks right up there in such August company as \\"Peyton Place,\\" \\"Valley of the Dolls\\" and \\"The Big Sleep.\\" <br /> <br />Make sure to bring along plenty of popcorn, and NO ONE will be admitted after the start of the first reel!	2004-09-09

However, he spends too much time in his book delving into post-modernist head-scratching about why Toscanini was so loved among the American people. Most of this, Horowitz chalks up to the P.R. machine NBC and RCA used to propel Toscanini into the living rooms of millions of Americans via radio and phonograph records.     Horowitz credits Toscanini's 'over'-popularity with stifling creativity and diversity among the ranks of classical musicians. Bosh! The man's been dead for 47 years, and no-one has come along since who made classical music such a household name. If there's anything America needs now, more than ever, it's a shot in the arm from someone such as Toscanini. All the NEA and PBS tax dollars in the world won't make the American people turn on to great music. Toscanini was popular because of his extraordinary talent for delineation and his perfectionism.     He made classical music not only enjoyable, but infused millions of Americans with the passion he himself had for the music. Do you see James Levine or anyone else making 'La Boheme' as exciting as Toscanini? Was Toscanini perfect? I would say not. However, if I as a four year old could grasp that there was something akin to superhumanism about Toscanini's conducting, that I just didn't pick up in Lenny Bernstein's wretched performances, then I don't see why it slips by Horowitz.     To be fair, Horowitz acknowledges Toscanini's abilities, but implies all throughout this book that something had been 'put over' on the American people. Horowitz seems to have confused Toscanini with Bernstein. But then, again, Horowitz recounts a quote from a Russian who told the author that if Leonard Bernstein had been a Russian that he would have been an unassailable superstar. Apparently, the Russian thought Bernstein was underappreciated over here.     This book gives a great history of Toscanini and the NBC, but reading it through Horowitz' cynical lenses makes one itchfor someone who can laud a true American treasure, instead of prospecting for clay.	2004-08-10
US	42160210	R8E5ZBJKKVAKT	0821226363	881901674	Hotel Lachapelle	Books	2	10	28	N	N	Pretentious, Show-offish Folderol	Now that fine arts photography seems to be permanently entrenched in a rut, it seems as though the only way for photographers to get noticed is to become celebrity photographers. It is quite an easy formula: To become a celebrity photographer, one must immerse themselves in the mindless world of celebrities, and, thus through hyperbole and self-insertion into this world of celebrity, one becomes a celebrity him- or her- self. David LaChapelle is no exception to this sappy, self-serving, trend which began the moment Annie Leibovitz ran out of ideas.  <br />  <br /> It is no coincidence that LaChapelle is so often compared to Herb Ritts. Both of them produce technically strong work that, alas, has no soul. Both their work screams the triumph of style (and such schlocky, narcissistic and ultimately vapid style at that) over substance. <br />  <br /> Ultimately, LaChapelle is an empty suit, now that the game in fine arts photography is not about achieving a unique vision -- wrought by years of mastering the craft of photography -- but in being seen as clever and trendy. The whole post-modern fraud -- in which LaChapelle is a routineer fellow traveller, posing as some sort of master of photography -- is predicated on the aesthetic equivalent of a hispter's sneer. <br />  <br /> Strangely, though, LaChapelle's work is neither clever, nor hip. If you want clever, check out Weegee. For real hip photos daddy-o, peruse Phil Stern's pix of the Rat Pack. If you need to ride Madonna's coattails to notoriety, then hip is way over your head. <br />  <br /> In Hotel LaChapelle, we are left bereft of inspiration and style. Certainly, the overly self-aware artiste gives a passable imitation of same, rather much as saccharine compares to honey. Strip this book of the glitz and the glam and we are left with a young photographer who has quite a store of technical know-how without the foggiest idea as to how he can put it to honest use. <br />  <br /> To those comparing the ostentatiousaffectations of this posuer who fancies himself a photographer to Man Ray or Andy Warhol, pulllllleeeaase! Albeit, Warhol was oftentimes just as pretentious; however, Warhol did have some pretty striking ideas, and some of his graphic (re)creations were brimming over with the stark sensibilities of Roy Lichtenstein or Paul Rand. As for Man Ray, LaChapelle is way out of his league. Man Ray belongs up there with Magritte, Dali and Luis Bunuel; LaChapelle fits in a little better with other trendoids such as the photography staff of Us Magazine. <br />  <br /> I find LaChapelle's work more akin to another hanger-oner of the celebrity scene, Yoko Ono. That's my story and I am sticking to it.	2004-07-25

Hayek, Ludwig von Mises and William F. Buckley. The sci-fi aficionados among us came to it by way of Robert A. Heinlein and Ayn Rand.  Ronald Reagan was seen by us as a politician who had absorbed their ideas and distilled them into a populist message that could speak to the average American. We were proud to be labeled as conservatives, because we were at the forefront of a movement that was both scholarly and intellectual yet passionate and emotional.<br />Now, a quarter century later, we are being asked to regard this baby faced Bush leaguer (pun intended) as some sort of leader of our movement? It's enough to drive a thinking man's conservative into the Democrat party, just for some sorely needed cerebral stimulation.<br />Don't get me wrong: I agree with Hannity more often than not.  In fact, I agree with him much more often than I agree with his liberal better half, Alan Colmes. However, Hannity brings to his Fox News cable show what he brings to his radio program: The Republican Party Line, presented in schematic form, with all the dots from A to Z connected by Hannity's deftly-wielded Crayola crayon. <br />And that is what this book basically is, a Chilton's manual of the conservative positions, so un-intellectually argued and reasoned that a half-wit can put them together. Perhaps when this book finds its rightful place in the bargain bin, it may see new life in a reprinting as &quot;Conservatism For Dummies.&quot;<br />From whence did Hannity come? He makes no bones that he was drawn to talk radio by the likes of Rush Limbaugh. But, Limbaugh is a far different breed: The scion of a legal family, surrounded by high-minded dinner table conversation, Limbaugh's first love was Top 40 radio. Put the two together, and you've got an intellectually-based mix of highfalutin ideas as made palatable for the Casey Kasem crowd.  Even Bill O'Reilly has a much more analytical background, having paid his dues as an investigative TV reporter for ABC and earning his master's degree from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.<br />What does Sean Hannity bring to the table? Hannity got into the racket as a caller who so loved calling in to talk radio programs that he figured out the perfect formula to ensconce himself at the other end of the mike. Sort of like how Eve Harrington took over Margot Channing's role in &quot;All About Eve.&quot;<br />But, that is the extent of Hannity's talent and intellect. Whether on radio or TV or in this book, you can guess each and every single statement that will come from Hannity's mouth or pen. All you have to know are what the Republican party talking points are for the day. You can see Hannity coming a mile away. He so predictably telegraphs his positions that he makes the crude and bombastic James Carville come off like a thoughtful and nuanced Christopher Hitchens by comparison.<br />Hannity's main asset is that he has the courage of convictions. Yet, that is all that's there, are convictions. Read Hannity's prose and you will have a new dictionary definition for &quot;knee jerk reactionary.&quot; I challenge lexicographers to top that one.<br />And, perhaps this is why Hannity is so popular with his doltish audience -- having shorn himself of the duty of having to think his positions through (he leaves that to Colmes, who blows Hannity away in the erudition department) -- because his opinions can be readily grasped, without the laborious and time-consuming process of mental digestion. Hannity's mantra is Soylent Green and Metamucil all rolled into one convenient Fruit Roll-Up.<br />I must admit that I agree with Hannity's critics who find he's preaching to the choir.  The problem, though, is that the homily is not being delivered by a cardinal or even a circus-tent preacher, but a goody two-shoes choir boy whose pre-pubescent voice hasn't even yet broken.<br />With conservatives pundits like these, who needs liberal nemeses?	2004-07-15

When something important happens we celebrate by sharing what we have,\\" said the late Chief Mathew King, known as Noble Red Man in Indian Country. \\"Even the poorest among us share what we have....The more you share the more you're given to share.\\"<br />Which is precisely what editor Harvey Arden has accomplished with his passion for keeping alive the wisdom of the American Indian.  In this book, Arden, a former senior editor for National Geographic, has compiled a comprehensive volume of the thoughts, philosophy, humor  and spirit of the great Oglala Lakota (Sioux) chief.<br />Noble Red Man was born Mathew King in 1902 in Grass Creek, S.D., a small community of Indians from different bands. He died in 1989. In the long stretch of time in between, he absorbed knowledge, wisdom and experiences that molded him into a sage and respected leader.<br />After three years in military school, his parents enrolled him in the Springfield Indian Seminary to become an ordained Episcopal minister. Hunger, more than faith, was his motivation.<br />\\"If you converted you ate better,\\" said Noble Red Man. \\"To help feed the starving Lakota my father and uncles became missionaries.\\" During training, he concluded that - despite being very spiritual  - that the clergy was not his calling. He had misgivings over Christian theology. \\"I have always believed in the Great Spirit and worshipped Him in my own way,\\" he said. \\"These people don't seem to want to change my belief in the Great Spirit, but to change my way of talking to Him.\\"<br />Instead, Noble Red Man set out to do the Great Spirit's work by teaching Indians to \\"earn their bread by the sweat of their brow,\\" finding work and securing labor rights for thousands of Indians over the years.  He became a voice not only for the Lakota people, but American Indians everywhere, taking their case to  court, before Congress and even overseas. His passion was fighting to regain South Dakota's Black Hills, sacred land promised the Lakota by the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, but swindled from them five years later when gold was discovered.<br />The federal government belittled the Indians' claim to this revered land in the 1970s by offering them $100 million. Noble Red Man retorted: \\"The Black Hills aren't for sale. What if we offered you a hundred million dollars for the Vatican, for Jerusalem?\\" The money still sits in escrow, unclaimed.<br />Arden first met Noble Red Man in 1983, on the 10th anniversary of the Lakota occupation of Wounded Knee, S.D., a reservation hamlet that was the site of the American Indians' last stand in 1890, as federal troops massacred over 350 Indians. The 1973 occupation - which was met with an FBI siege for 71days - was staged by the American Indian Movement (AIM) in  protest over the government's harsh treatment of Indians. He and venerated Chief Frank Fools Crow provided moral support to the occupiers, while placating armed FBI agents.<br />As Arden attempted to explain to Noble Red Man why he'd come to Pine Ridge, the chief shot back: \\"I know why you're here! White Man came to this country and forgot his original Instructions. We Indians have never forgotten our Instructions.... I can't tell you  what those were, but maybe there are some things that I can explain....\\"<br />That is what Arden has done. Culled from his interview notes and tapes, Arden felt that he didn't have enough material to compile the book that was Noble Red Man's unrealized dream. After the chief's death, Arden visited his daughter, Lavon King, who had kept her father's old reel-to-reel tapes in a trunk.  In a labor of love, by 1994 Arden finished the job he began 11 years earlier. With this book, he has put into print Noble Red Man's credo, reflections, recollections and hopes.<br />There is even a good measure of humor, which captures Noble Red Man's keen sense of irony.

Unfortunately, the actual history of the code talkers got buried in the shoot-em-up special-effects extravaganza filmed by action director John Woo, who was way out of his league. In that movie, the brave and inventive contributions of the code talkers merely served as a plot device for the white hero's (played by Nicholas Cage) ultimate redemption.<br />However, those interested in the rarely-told real story need only to open the pages of this informative book. <br />Author McClain follows the story of the almost 400 Navajos who volunteered for service during World War II and served in all six Marine divisions. These enlistees adapted their native tongue, Dineh, into an unbreakable code that would keep Japanese radio operators and cryptologists entirely baffled during the length of the war.<br />The obscure origins of the Navajo code talker program date back to World War I. After American entry in that war, the signal corps learned that Central powers were listening in on orders relayed on that new communication tool, the radio. They then engaged Choctaw Indians as radio operators in order to safely transmit information. It worked like a charm.<br />However, after war's end, the German government sent numerous \\"scholars\\" to the United States in order to \\"study\\" the lives and societies on many American Indian nation reservations. Actually, the so-called students were intelligence agents there to learn native languages.<br />After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the need for a absolutely secret code was vital. Marine Maj. Gen. Clayton B. Vogel and civilian Philip Johnston, a white man who grew up on the Navajo reservation at Leuppe, Ariz., concluded that Navajo would be an ideal code language because many Navajo were educated in English at Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) schools, and especially since no German scholars had been sent to Navajo reservations. This secret code would be instrumental in keeping Corps operations secure and, most importantly, its men alive.<br />On May 4, 1942, the Marines had recruited 29 Navajos, which formed the 382nd Platoon, a trial unit that would go through the rigors of boot camp at the Marine Depot at San Diego. Although attrition levels for this period were between five to ten per cent, not one Navajo dropped out of the training.<br />Up until graduation from boot camp, the \\"first 29\\" (as they would later be known as) had no idea for what special duty they had been recruited. Upon arrival at Camp Elliott, outside of San Diego, they were informed that their mission was to devise a code for secret and rapid radio transmission based on their native tongue. Code talker Eugene Crawford recalled the irony of the situation: Having been forced to speak only English in the BIA schools he attended, \\"he could almost taste the harsh brown soap the teachers forced him to use to scrub out his mouth when he was caught speaking Navajo.\\" Now, his government was ordering him and his fellow Marines to use Navajo to defeat the enemy!<br />Once the code was in place, code talkers were sent to the Pacific and were key in assisting U.S. forces to victory in its island-hopping campaign in battles such as Bougainville, Cape Gloucester, New Britain, Saipan, Guam and Iwo Jima. Because they were all proficient in both English and Navajo, the code talkers lent an element of speed previously unavailable in decoding. Translation from English to Navajo back to English was instant; prior to that, it took hours to decode cryptographic messages and recode the replies. This was a crucial element in the swiftness of battle that left Japanese forces reeling.<br />Marine cipher specialist Richard Bonham remarked on the Navaho code: \\"The efficiency that the Navajo developed themselves, to write it down immediately and exactly, was something we marveled at. When you needed an artillery strike, you want it to start now!\\"<br />Most importantly, countless American lives were saved by the code talkers. They were regarded as so essential that fellow Marines were assigned as their bodyguards, to keep them out of enemy hands. Strangely, the code talkers were occasionally the targets of their fellow Marines, as they were sometimes mistaken for Japanese soldiers in disguise.<br />After war's end, the code talkers returned to the reservation heroes, but did not receive a hero's welcome. Yet, they stayed true to their oaths to keep the code secret. Their mission was classified and not until 1969 would they receive public recognition for their exploits. Thanks to the efforts of Congressman Lee Cannon - who had fought at Iwo Jima with the 4th Marine Division - the Navajo code talkers were honored during the 4th Marine Division Association's reunion in Chicago that year. After the last code talker was honored, Cannon lauded them, \\"these men are quiet; they kept their trust; they are Fourth Division heroes - every one of them!\\"<br />Author McClain tells the code talkers' story matter-of-factly, relying on a wealth of information from declassified military documents, valuable oral history from the Doris Duke collection (Duke was the first to systematically interview the Navajo code talkers) and numerous interviews conducted by the author herself. Although the history is recounted somewhat dryly, this is a thoroughgoing and honest effort. She lets the book's heroes do much of the talking: There is a treasure trove of personal anecdotes and first-person eyewitness accounts. Although not the most polished history I've read (often, rank is not cited), it does give the reader that \\"you are there\\" feeling.<br />The spirit of these proud people's exploits can be summed up in the words of code talker Carl Gorman:<br />\\"Many people ask me why I fought for my country when the government has treated us pretty bad. But, before the white man came to this country, this whole land was Indian country and we still think it's our land, so we fight for it. I was very proud to serve my country.&quot;	2003-11-13
US	42160210	RITRC4R0QVNET	031230935X	702211299	Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War	Books	3	6	14	N	N	Blue and Grey Matter	In the annals of literature, the historical novel has deep roots: There are scores written about the American Civil War alone, most notably Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage (1895) and Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind (1936). Lately, though, a somewhat new category has emerged, \\"what if\\" historical fiction, that offers a look of what may have passed had events unfolded differently. Its best example is Robert Harris' Fatherland (1992), which is based on the chilling premise of life in 1960s Germany had the Nazis won World War II. Fatherland represents this genre's best because its themes go beyond the specific turning point of its \\"what if\\" plot. It is not important because it's predicated on the Nazis winning D-Day; rather, its significance lies in the story of an SS officer's journey from idealistic soldier to disillusioned father, and how he sacrifices himself in order to teach his son a lesson about fidelity to truth above regimes.<br />Its significance lies in the historical lessons it illuminates.<br />Philosopher George Santanyana proclaimed, \\"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\\" Former Speaker of the House and co-author Newt Gingrich has a somewhat more malleable view of history when describing how he and military historian William R. Forstchen (who did most of the writing) approached \\"Gettysburg\\": \\"We...have learned that when you reduce history to passive memorization, you lose people,\\" Gingrich remarks. \\"We embrace the concept of an active history: `In a particular situation, what would I have done?'\\"<br />Thus does the battle of Gettysburg -- which was fought in the humid and sweltering heat of the Pennsylvania Dutch country in July, 1863 -- unfold anew. Its underlying premises are: \\"What if Gen. Robert E. Lee fought Gettysburg differently? What if he listened to the counsel of his generals to take a defensive posture, in particular, Gen. James Longstreet? What if the Confederacy won Gettysburg, how would they have done it?\\"<br />That's a pretty tall order. Personally, I couldn't imagine the South winning Gettysburg without Gen. Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, the brilliant Confederate tactician whose exploits in the Shenandoah Valley campaign alone rank him as the greatest military mind this country ever produced. Unfortunately, that couldn't have happened, since Jackson was wounded by friendly fire at Chancellorsville, and died shortly thereafter of infections that ravaged his body.<br />Instead, Gingrich and Forstchen serve up quite an audacious alternative version of events: Using the same cast of characters (Generals Lee, Longstreet, Stuart and Pickett for the South; Generals Meade, Reynolds, Hancock and Hunt for the Union), they manage to correct the mistakes from one side (the Confederacy), while maintaining the pecadillos of the other (the Army of the Potomac) in order to turn the tide for the boys in gray.<br />This is one of the most well-researched historical novels I've read in a long time. Forstchen, Gingrich and their contributing editor, Albert S. Hanser, have culled an amazing amount of factual data about the personages involved, their personal lives, the terrain in the theater of operations, the weaponry, troop movements and various miscellany that give the reader an unmistakable \\"you are there\\" feeling. The battle scenes are bloody, brutal, and spare no realistic detail to assuage the squeamish. \\"Gettysburg\\" is an engrossing and entertaining read, and I recommend it highly to both Civil War buffs and students of military battle.<br />Ringing endorsements stop there because, for all the authors' insights into battle, historical minutiae and command leadership, there is little else to intrigue the reader. While it notches the action up to Schwarzenegger levels, its dialogue is stilted, but nevertheless on a Grand Scale.  When the leadership (particularly of the Dixie persuasion) stop to think, they do so in Deep, Grave, Philosophically Reflective and Platitudinous thought balloons worthy of the School of Athens, as ornately etched by Michelangelo, or Rembrandt.<br />And this is the book's major fault: In elevating its Confederate heroes to the level of their legends (and, conversely, in bringing down its Union nemeses to their cynical worst), the authors sweep under the rug their protagonists' human faults and failings (which were the cause of the CSA's defeat). It's easy not to be condemned to repeat history when it's re-enacted by demi-gods, not real men with real limitations.<br />There is also scant evidence of Gettysburg's implications for the trebling effects on the state of a divided nation. What shall become of slavery? The Constitution? Will the Union be forever split into two? What of Lincoln's fate? \\"Gettysburg\\" offers slim pickings for those whose minds might meander away from Devil's Den or Seminary Ridge.<br />This novel could have been Novel. Instead, the authors kept it at the technique-bound level of an intellectual exercise, sort of like replaying the Bobby Fisher / Boris Spassky chess matches. The most important historical lesson learned from \\"Gettysburg\\" is that hindsight is 20/20. Big deal.<br />Of course, I may be opining too soon, as \\"Gettysburg\\" is the first installment of a proposed trilogy. Weightier questions may indeed be answered in future tomes. For the time being, it leaves me -- (after trudging through more than 450 pages of dense prose and stately cogitation) - haunted by Miss Peggy Lee's famous query: \\"Is That All There Is?\\"<br />Among novels of the \\"what if\\" genre, this thoroughgoing but ultimately trifling opus brings to mind a constant rejoinder often voiced by Gingrich's pal, Rush Limbaugh (albeit, in different contexts):<br />\\"If is for children.\\"ous thought balloons worthy of the School of Athens, as ornately etched by Michelangelo, or Rembrandt.<br />And this is the book's major fault: In elevating its Confederate heroes to the level of their legends (and, conversely, in bringing down its Union nemeses to their cynical worst), the authors sweep under the rug their protagonists' human faults and failings (which were the cause of the CSA's defeat).

Thus, were some of my fellow petrochemical rocker friends and I also susceptible to the lilting iconoclastic strains of one Ayn Rand, who with her book \\"The Fountainhead,\\" carved out her own Nietzsche (pun intended) among uebermensch, one Howard Roark, a prototypical punker before his time.<br />So, put on your thinking caps, energy domes or plastic pompadours and your anti human-element suits and delve into this pussaint tome by Miss Rand.<br />You will be doing neck salutes as you read her introductory essay of the same title as the book. After writing four major novels of varying philosophical degrees, Miss Rand finally sticks her toe into the swimming pool of profundity with this essay, and tries to stake out her territory vis-a-vis the writers of the great books (according to the Encyclopaedia Brittanica, at least).  Voila! By her own objective analysis, she kicks the pants off of them, and conveniently categorises them into either one of two columns: \\"Attilas\\" or \\"Witch Doctors.\\"<br />The Attilas (big daddy zeros, in Devo-speak) are the proverbial gang of thugs who stifle thought and proscribe against actions resulting from independent agents. They carry around clubs and grunt like high school football jocks and generally make life miserable for artistic coffee house types who affect an air of bored sophistication.<br />The Witch Doctors (Mystics of the Mind, the corporate media types of pesudo-intellectuals who pander to the masses in order to control them, sort of like Rod Rooter of Big Entertainment) are basically your monolithic hucksters who lure in otherwise smart people to carry out their evil deeds. Think Josef Goebbels, Jim Jones, Herf Applewhite, the Unibomber and Jerry Falwell here.  They mouth slogans like \\"Duty Now For the Future,\\" and reduce humanity to the level ofmental mutants.<br />The rest of the book is Rand's greatest hits, philosophically-bent speeches from her novels. The best are from \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" because the neo-industrialists delivering them always leave their opponents in the dust.<br />Whip It.  Whip it Good!	2003-06-14

Still, though, the book itself is based upon an implausible premise, which the elucidated translation is still unable to cover up: There's an invisible, omniscient and omnipotent super-being that created everything, gave his only son to die on the cross, told another guy, Abraham, to kill his own son, and generally behaves like a two year old whose cookie has been taken away when any of his creations displease him. Otherwise, this lordly ruler is a pretty decent fellow, and bestows abundance upon his creations when they blindly follow his every whim.<br />A rather one-dimensional protagonist this \\"God\\"; I found Jake Barnes in Hemingway's \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" to be a more well-rounded, fleshed out character, a much more believeable and tragic hero.<br />However, this book has an awesome ending, full of special effects, the chapter \\"Revelations,\\" which is sort of a cross between Cecil B. deMille's \\"The Ten Commandments,\\" Art Bell's book \\"The Quickening,\\" \\"Terminator II\\" and Liszt's \\"Totentanz.\\" It's sort of like watching \\"Fantasia\\" while tripping on acid, only a lot scarier.	2003-06-10

Based in Laguna Beach, California, he was photographer to many of Hollywood's most famous, working with such acclaimed figures as Fay Wray, Cecil B. deMille and Marlene Dietrich. While his \\"pictorialist\\" style of photography -- painterly and posh, relying on soft-focus and darkroom knowhow to produced luxuriously toned and finished prints -- was favoured by the stars, clearly Mortensen found himself on the wrong side of history when it came to fine arts photography. The new \\"purist\\" movement, which celebrated the \\"straight,\\" unadorned, print and a more documentarian style, was afoot and found no place for the Gothic-inspired Mortensen.<br />Except that's not quite the way it happened. For the f/64 group, spearheaded by Ansel Adams and Beaumont and Nancy Newhall (of the Museum of Modern Art), it was not enough merely to disagree philosophically with Mortensen. Had they done so, it would have been unlikely that Mortensen would have been forgotten and ignored so during his own lifetime and after his death, for he was something more than just another painterly salon photographer: His compositions were steeped in Gothic and Romantic traditions, his subject matter often whimsical, often bizarre, his style a strange combination of Lorenzo de Bernini, Edgar Allan Poe, Salvador Dali and Maxfield Parrish.  Unfortunately for Mortensen, though, his eclectic aesthetic was viewed as bizarre and irrelevant by those hoisting the purist banner.<br />In his essay, \\"Beyond Recall,\\" photographer A.D. Coleman -- who is quite sympathetic to the Adams aesthetic -- presents a scathing indictment of Adams and the Newhalls, and their active campaign to completely shut out Mortensen from the elite artistic inner circles. Although he never said so, it is evident from reading these essays that Mortensen died a broken man. Even after Mortensen's death, \\"Saint Ansel\\" Adams tried to prevent Mortensen's work from being archived at the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona. Fortunately, for posterity, curator James Enyeart (who, though a friend of Adams) remained objective, and was instrumental in finding a permanent home for Mortensen's artistic legacy.<br />Sadly, little remains of his artistic output: Most of Mortensen's negaives are missing, whereabouts unknown. He also left few notes or letters. No conclusions can be drawn, but it is strongly suggested that by the time he died Mortensen felt so irrelevant to the history of photography that he never bothered to leave much behind.<br />However, the authors and editors of this handsome book have constructed a strong foundation on which to rebuild Mortensen's reputation. Michael Dawson's essay \\"William Mortensen: Gothic Modernist\\" and \\"William Mortensen and George Dunham: Photography as Collaboration,\\" by Diane Dillon go a long way in providing a narrative to Mortensen's often quiet and secretive life, and in outlining his artistic method (Dunham's collection of prints, articles and memorabilia filled in many of the gaps in the Mortensen archive).<br />The book's only shortcoming is that while it has three excellent essays and a bibliography and chronology that put Mortensen's work in context of the greater photographical history of his time, it is a bit short on photographs. There are only about three dozen plates of his work, which -- while representative -- don't really do full justice to fleshing out his life's work. I would have loved to have seen more of his color portraits and nudes.<br />That said, don't let this stop you from buying this book. The printing is first rate, and so is the treatment of its sorely neglected subject. Admirers of William Mortensen can only hope for a more exhaustive book of photographs to be released in the near future.	2003-05-18

Repressed prudes who grew up in Lynchburg, Va, who now need to get out from under religious fundamentalists' war against common sense and healthy sex, and;<br />2). Narcissists who are so self-obsessed that they make Prince and<BR>Madonna look like John the Baptist and the real Madonna.<br />For the former, this is indeed a liberating text. Run! -- don't walk -- to your nearest bookseller and buy this before it's too late! As you reach the unabashed pleasure of your first self-imposed orgasm, you will thank Betty Dodson, shouting \\"Free at last! Free at last! Thank God almighty, I'm free at last!\\"<br />For the latter, this is more of the fawning adulation and psychological reinforcement you've come to expect as your birthright, a daily affirmation for your right to love yourself above all others. It must be nice living life with nothing but mirrors around you, and Ms. Dodson fashions quite the looking glass with this book.<br />However, for those who don't need an authority figure to say it's \\"okay\\" to fondle ourselves, and for those who don't think this world revolves around ourselves, this book leaves some pretty slim pickins. And this is the main problem with the book.<br />I don't know about women: Their good looks and curvaceous figures may be adequate for self-arousal. But for any guy (who isn't a narcissist) who masturbates, we all know that masturbation is hardly an act of self *love.* More often than not, it's something we do when there's not a female companion available, or because we are fantasizing about some other woman (or women). That is to say, masturbation is more a form of altruistic devotion to the women of our dreams and fantasies than it is an act of self worship. Masturbation is thus not *self* love, but worship at the altar of Woman. If this reader had to rely on his own carnalbeing as a source for sexual inspiration and arousal, he'd *never* masturbate.<br />Fortunately, though, there's the pornography business. And there's<BR>always the hope that the lover of our dreams will walk into our lives someday. Hence, masturbation, because that so seldom happens. C'est la vie.<br />To sum up: I agree with the crux of Ms. Dodson's argument, that<BR>masturbation is healthy and natural. It is. However, I disagree that it should be *preferred* to sex with a loving partner. It's sort of like buying one of those fake Rolex watches from the guy standing on the street corner of 48th and Broadway. It satisfies our need to tell time, but falls far short of our need to bask in real opulence. Same with masturbation. There's no subsitute for the real thing.<br />On second thought, while I agree with Dodson that masturbation is<BR>healthy and natural, I wish she would back off from all that liberal moral relativity talk about masturbation not being dirty and shameful; Please, don't take away our sinful pleasures, Betty! Sex is *always* more fun when it's dirty, just as drinking was more pleasureable during Prohibition, when it was illegal.	2003-04-25

If you think about it, it's more a collection of short stories by various authors that tell the story of God and his sundry children, most of them Hebraic. God is a pretty powerful heavy, though it's implied that he incorporeal and invisible.  Although he's usually depicted in the movies sitting on a throne and sporting a long beard, in \\"Exodus,\\" he appears as a bolt of fire. Other places in the book, he speaks as a burning bush. Excellent special fx all throughout.<br />There's a lot of begats going on, and in the chapter titled \\"Song of Solomon,\\" we get a nice PG-13 to R-rated glimpse of the ... sensual mores of these people. <br />There's also a pretty cool story about this guy named Job and how God had an ongoing bet with Satan as to who would win his soul. I don't want to give away the ending, but there's a lot of pathos, hubris and plotlines right out of such movies as \\"Trading Places,\\" \\"Meet John Doe\\" and \\"Life Stinks.\\"<br />My favorite one, though is about Moses, and how he led his people out of Egypt and to the promised land.  Along the way, though, Dathan tries to make them worship a golden calf. Personally, I preferred the movie version, as directed by Cecil B. deMille: The character development of Moses (played by Chuck Heston), Dathan (Edward G. Robinson) and Moses' mother (the ever comely Anne Baxter) is much improved.  And also, in Technicolor.<br />There is little plot to this book, save for in the second half, much of which revolves around God's son, Jesus, an interesting fellow. Definitely, the story has finally hit a stride, so the New Testament reads like a novella. Everywhere this Jesus guy goes, he travels with his posse of \\"Apostles,\\" who aren't your standard yes men. Although they all sing his praises when the going's good, one gives a great \\"I don't know about no Jesus\\" performance (Peter) worthy of a scruffy rat like Steve Buscemi. Another (Judas) sells out Jesus fora bunch of dead presidents, like Sean Penn did in \\"Carlito's Way.\\"  Unfortunately, Jesus gets rubbed out by an Italian gang, \\"The Romans,\\" who torture him and nail him to a cross in revenge for representing on their turf.  Lots of high drama here.<br />\\"Revelations\\" was pretty weird, sort of like watching \\"Fantasia\\" while doing mushrooms, only a lot scarier.<br />Altogether, an excellent read.	2003-04-16

US	42160210	R3R5N0JL7KRVRF	0553268880	380807670	The Prince of Tides: A Novel	Books	3	24	30	N	N	A Flawed Epic	I read Pat Conroy's &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; on the recommendation of a friend whose opinion I value highly.  Well, I still value her opinion highly, and this book is the page-turner everyone has proclaimed it to be.  As a popular novel, it delivers, and I would have given it five stars.<br />Except....except.....Conroy's aspirations for this novel were obviously beyond the easily won praise given to serial novelists.  What he has attempted with &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; is to craft an epic saga of a Southern family.  He comes close -- painfully close -- to his goal, but alas he falls short.<br />The themes running throughout Conroy's novels are the dysfunctional family and the mental illness that acts as either a forboding harbinger or evidence of the damage wrought by said family.  I have no qualms with that; &quot;The Great Santini&quot; -- a much better realisation of these themes -- spoke clearly and concisely to those themes.<br />But Conroy the poet -- waxing so eloquently, with his pen alternately dipped in sugar and saccharine when conjuring up a Southland out of the Book of Eden -- gets carried away with the sound and the fury of his elephantine vocabulary that it borders on the ridiculous.  Okay, I get the point:  Pat Conroy is a walking thesaurus.  So was H.L. Mencken.  The difference is that Mencken used his typewriter like a bayonet, and hammered out his essays in a &quot;reductio ad absurdum,&quot; satirical bent. Mencken's very intention in layering his pieces with multisyllabic words was ridicularity through an over-emphasised pomposity; Conroy's problem is he doesn't know he's being ridiculous.  His flowery prose-poem style attempts to hearken to the era of Margaret Mitchell and William Faulkner, but comes of as incongruous at times with his subject matter.  An example of this is his expertness with his impressionistic descriptions of the flora and fauna of the Carolina coastal marshes and lowwater country.  He paints quite a pretty picture.  But when he turns to descriptions of Manhattan and the social set that people that island, he almost telegraphs his superficial familiarity with the City That Never Sleeps.  Almost before I read the scene in the French restaurant, how come I immediately knew that he and the psychiatrist would order a Chateau Margaux?<br />An editor's merciless red fountain pen would have made this novel novel, and put Conroy in the front rank of America's novelists.  The children's book-within-a-book could have been excised entirely;  It's almost as long as the John Galt speech from Ayn Rand's &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; and just as gratuitous in sabotaging the novel as a whole.  Mr. Conroy should learn that a novel's genius lies as much in what is left implied and unsaid as it does in didactic explication.<br />That aside, there's an excellent story underneath the overstuffed comforter of Conroy's excessive imagination.  Three generations of the Wingo family will leave you entertained and enlightened on family dynamics, eccentric characters and integrity.  The novel centers around Tom Wingo, a somewhat deflated middle-ager who's resigned himself to unhappiness.  When his sister, the tortured poet Savannah attempts suicide, he rushes off to Manhattan to be at her side.  <br />The MacGuffin is that Savannah has forbidden Tom from visiting her at the mental ward, so this sends Tom careening into the office and arms of Dr. Susan Lowenstein, Savannah's psychiatrist (fortunately, I've never seen the movie version, so in my mind's eye, she's played by Lorraine Bracco, not Babs Streisand).  This pairing is very fortuitous, for it allows Tom to spill the entire family history across three generations to Lowenstein in an obvious, but forgivable, literary device.  It also brings up some great subplots of Tom becoming the private football coach of Susan's sissified and alienated teenaged son, Bernard, and a rather juicy subplot in which they share the same bed after Tom rebuffs Susan'ssnobbish husband, a world-class violinist, for his anti-Southern bigotry.<br />Finally, at the end of the novel, the reader finds out to whom the title refers, none other than Tom's big brother Luke, an amalgam of Francis Marion (the Swamp Fox) and Captain Planet, a rather unlikely combination, but one that jibes with Conroy's baby-boomer idealism and also one that explains both Tom's nervous breakdown and Savannah's suicide attempts (that, and the Deep, Dark, Family Secret, which Conroy uses sledgehammer-subtle foreshadowing to hint at with the denouement of each chapter, rather much as in a comic-book serial).<br />Nonetheless, the Great Story is in the tales of the eccentric Wingo clan.  From the alcoholic father, the social-climbing mother and their equally offbeat forebears and offspring, this is one heckuva book.  It's too bad that Conroy didn't have enough faith in his well thought-out characters not to have burdened them with a preposterous, overreaching romance-novel plot.	2003-02-18
US	42160210	R1IZCHRVQCK38P	0312119267	825292175	Leni Riefenstahl: A Memoir	Books	3	11	29	N	N	Whitewash	As the old saying goes, \\"only the good die young.\\" This doesn't<BR>necessarily follow that the evil always die old, but it's noteworthy that the controversial photographer and movie director Leni Riefenstahl just turned 100 last year.<br />Reading this book was painful for me: As a Catholic in the 1990s, I worked for a Jewish civil rights organisation, and I am currently a fine-arts photographer, who has been deeply influenced by the broad sweep and tightly framed compositions of Riefenstahl. She is doubtless a pioneer in cinema and photography, and those who would lambast her art as without merit are putting their morality and politics ahead of their objective judgment.<br />In my review of \\"Olympia,\\" there is nothing but unqualified praise; But this book is not *primarily* concerned with her art as it is justifying her collaboration with the Nazis. Given that context, and having opened that can of worms, she is found morally wanting.<br />I was stationed in Germany with the Army during the 1980s, and even then, it was the same old story, like a broken record, hearing the older Germans fall all over themselves in explaining away their dubious \\"noninvolvement\\" with the Third Reich: \\"Hitler was a horrible man.....I was never a member of the Nazi party.....We knew nothing of the Holocaust.....The German people really despised the Nazis, but there was nothing we could do,\\" etc.<br />That's basically what Riefenstahl's account of her years as chief<BR>glorifier of the Third Reich is: A painstakingly dry account of<BR>semi-plausible denial. After all these years, she's yet to categorically apologise. In this book, she also glosses<BR>over her use of gypsies from concentration camps in one of her movies. Also, Riefenstahl should be exonerated because, after all, she \\"was never a member of the Nazi Party.\\" Please, this tome was published in 1995, but denying one's party membership was<BR>already old hat when Mel Brooks put that line into the mouth of neo-Nazi playwright Franz Liebkind, author of \\"Springtime For Hitler\\" in \\"The Producers\\" in 1968.<br />So, we are left with this paradox: Was Leni Riefenstahl a genius or a monster?<br />I regard \\"Olympia,\\" her film of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, as the<BR>greatest documentary of the past century. It is a cinematic marvel, a rare work of grace and beauty that captures the true essence of the Olympian spirit.<br />But her 1934 masterpiece of technique, \\"Triumph of the Will\\" was equally brilliant and equally pioneering. It reveals a mind of unparalled insight and intelligence. And there's the rub: This makes her culpability even greater, because she was smart enough to know better. Riefenstahl was no babe in the woods, she was a sophisticated, worldly woman (read her accounts of her romances, her theories on cinema and her account of her life after World War II). Still, she expects us to believe she was some naif when it came to the Nazis. Sorry, I'm not buying; She was both a genius and a monster.<br />One reviewer tries to explain this away: \\"Artists and creators under censorship find ways to express themselves despite the hostile climate.\\" Some, such as Jonathan Swift and Moliere, wrote satirical adventures to undermine the authoritarian regimes of their lands and times. World War II is rife with examples of artists who fled Europe to find freedom in America: Directors Billy Wilder, Fritz Lang and Ernst Lubitsch all saw the writing on the wall, and got out. Lubitsch even directed a gem of parody on the Nazis with \\"To Be Or Not to Be.\\" Italian director Goffredo<BR>Allesandrini made an epic movie out of Ayn Rand's  anti-totalitarian novel, \\"We the Living\\" -- which the Fascists wanted as anti-Russian propaganda -- but made it as a thinly veiled allegory against Mussolini's regime, and it was soon pulled out of circulation. Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini left America to return to Italy and refused to play the Fascist anthem, and was jailed for standing up to the Fascisti. Dear readers, *that* is how artists with *guts* \\"express themselves, despite the hostile climate.\\" They don't cozy up to the dictators and turn them into the second-coming of Jesus Christ, like Riefenstahl did. Riefenstahl's weak denials come off like conductor Herbert von Karajan's explanations that he \\"made due\\" under the Nazis. Truth be told, both Riefenstahl and Karajan were opportunists who *literally* climbed over corpses to the respective tops of their arts, because all their competition had either fled, been imprisoned, or executed.<br />Personally, I think Leni Riefenstahl should have been imprisoned at Spandau for fifty years. Certainly, I would have given her free artistic rein and run of the prison. She would have made some dark and charming images of the dank prison walls, the gruel for supper and rodents and cockroaches coinhabiting her cell, instead of being let loose in the world to rehabilitate her self-image by filming the Nubians in Africa. Monsters who are yet geniuses are still monsters, and it is society's obligation not to whitewash their sins, but to put them on display in order that civilisation not be mocked.	2003-01-25
US	42160210	R23Z2LX136IDOX	382281945X	494574810	Riefenstahl Olympia	Books	5	29	30	N	N	Leni Captures the Olympics' Hellenic Spirit	In the 1937 preface to the first edition of this book, Leni Riefenstahl remarked 'it is the timeless document of a great idea -- a hymn to beauty and competetive endeavour.' Sixty-five years later, the graceful images of athletes competing in the 1936 Berlin games has more than withstood the test of time and validated Riefenstahl's original estimation of this work's ground-breaking importance, not only as a document, but as an exercise in the aesthetics of the idealised beauty of the human body in movement.<br />Leni Riefenstahl was something of a Renaissance woman: Photographer, motion picture director, editor, dancer, skier, and all-around athlete, no one could have been a better match for documenting the 1936 Olympics on film, from which stills were culled to create this volume. True to the spirit of Ancient Greece, it is fitting that it was captured on silver nitrate by this gifted cinematographer christened Helene (her birth name, for which 'Leni' is a German nickname).<br />Actually, the term 'stills' does injustice to the photographs contained with -- so alive are they, capturing the essence of athleticism and motive power.<br />The beginning of the book is devoted to Ancient Greece, and documenting the ruins which monumentalise her greatness: The Parthenon, Myron's discus thrower, the gods, such as Apollo and Achilles. Riefenstahl has brought many of the famous statues of athletes alive, as she photographs naked men and women engaged in the ancient sports, such as the javelin throw, the shot put, eurythmics, dance and the discus throw. Her athletes epitomise the grace, sensuousness and taut, muscular efficiency of the male and female bodies.<br />Another striking sequence is of the young Greek torch bearer, who ignites the torch at Athens and delivers it on his long route through Thermopaylae, the Grecian shore, Delphi and Corinth. The poise and determination in the runner's body and eyes convey the Olympic spirit with the same glowing certitude as the eternal flame, which the runner holds aloft like a beacon in the night.<br />Once in Berlin, the bulk of this volume is dedicated to the athletes themselves. Leni's cameramen captured all the events, and some of the images are just astounding for their sense of motion and eloquent simplicity of composition. Among my favourites are: The Flame from Greece, which shows a German youth standing before the crowd of athletes, holding the flame erect before lighting the stadium torch; Start of the 80 meter hurdles, as seen from the timekeeper's point-of-view, the lines demarcating the oval track's lanes sweep into a bird's eye view of the pensive hurdlers as they await the starter's gun; Jesse Owens in the starting blocks, the great athlete is the very embodiment of concentration; German Gisela Mauermayer, discus thrower, shows the female athlete in motion, and in joyous release on her way to the gold medal; Shadows of marathon runners, which convey the fleeting rush of the events; Finale, which shows the Berlin Olympicstadion encircled by pillars of searchlights just before the flame is extinguished.<br />'Olympia' is, to me, the greatest expression of graceful motion ever captured by a photographer. A tone poem for camera, these images better convey the concept of motion than 99% of the movies today, which are motion pictures in name only.<br />This edition, by the German publisher Taschen, is truer to the original, both in graphics and in the accutance of the photography, than St. Martin's 1994 reprinting.  Highest recommendation.	2003-01-21

But, so what:  They deserve bashing!  My favourite targets of his ire were post-modernist talentless art school poseurs, violently agressive hippy burnout peaceniks, \\"hip\\" people, Chicagoan \\"Jim Belushi\\" types, dumb jocks and pretentious Americans such as I who use the British spelling of words (e.g., \\"colour\\" instead of \\"color\\"; \\"kerb\\" rather than \\"curb\\").<br />Some of the material is just too bizarre to describe here -- I don't want to give away the weirdness, so find out for yourself about \\"On Sports,\\" \\"Pogeybait,\\" \\"The Happy Fisherman\\" and other such sundry freakishness.<br />But this book also reveals a soft-spot in Clowes' heart, particularly in the short \\"Ugly Girls,\\" in which he questions society's norms of \\"beauty.\\"  Though he doesn't use the name \\"Enid,\\" the reader can tell that Clowes has long been entranced and obsessed with the raven-haired, bookish, bespectacled wallflower type.  I agree:  She *is* much more stunning than those trophy blondes.	2003-01-07

Also on the bill was the main showing -- a retrospective of prints by the recently deceased Louis Faurer, of whom I had only passing knowledge -- which was sponsored by Robert Frank's foundation named in honour of his daughter, Andrea.  Fortunately for me, I bit the hook baited with the Frank photographs (which were beautiful to see in person for the first time) and finally got acquainted with Faurer's work.<br />Lou Faurer was a fashion photographer from the late 1940s through the early 1970s for such magazines as Harper's Bazaar and Vogue, but his passion was photographing Times Square in Manhattan at night.  What immediately struck me about his photographs was how Faurer took the blaring and glaring crossroads in the city that never sleeps, and extracted from them utter solitude and psychic desolation.  An aging woman shields herself with an umbrella from the blinding fury of incandescent lights flickering, despite the dry pavements; A family up from the farmland poses for a portrait which places their quiet dignity  in the foreground against the marquees of movie theatres; a man stands along the kerb both awestruck and intimidated, in a shot which must have later been the genesis of Robert deNiro's defining role of Travis Bickle, the loner cabbie who pads up and down Broadway in total anonymity.<br />There is plenty of fare available to the keen eye of the viewer who wants something off the beaten path, that's yet set on one of the most beaten paths in the world's travelogues.<br />Faurer was the son of Russian Jewish immigrants and grew up in Philadelphia.  It was here that he began his explorations as an amateur street photographer.  During World War II, he took a photographic course from the Army, and was a civilian photographer for the War Department.  After the Allied victory ended the war, Faurer began working in the fashion industry.  It was around this time that his friendship with newly arrived Swiss-Jewish emigre Robert Frank began, as both worked as fashion photogs, while Faurer spent much of his time sweating away in Frank's darkroom.  In the 1950s, their career paths diverged, with Frank following in the steps of Walker Evans as a straight documentarian, leaving Faurer to the fashion set.  Yet, the two remained friends, despite Faurer's angry demeanour.  One friend described friendship with Faurer as \\"high maintenance.\\"<br />Faurer was exacting in capturing the exact tonal range and precise contrast needed to convey the feel of New York at night.  Most of his early work is printed by himself, and while technically beautiful, it is refreshing to see that Faurer was not a perfectionist -- on many of his prints he left scratches, eyelash hairs and dust spots from negatives unretouched, whereas most other exhibiting photographers would have sweated bullets in spot-toning them out of existence.  Strangely, it works, giving the viewer the \\"you are there\\" feeling of being present at the creation.  <br />Also introduced for the first time are many of Faurer's Kodachrome reversal transparencies from the same time period (taken with his Leica rangefinder, very patiently handheld at night to render acceptably sharp images at 40 ASA).  The resultant C-type prints made from internegatives are very faithful to Kodachrome's trademark warm tonality, and give us an alternative take on 1940s/50s Times Square.<br />Despite his photography being selected by Edward Steichen for the \\"Family of Man\\" compendium, Faurer remained on the fringes of the gallery scene, never fully embraced by the art photography movement until the 1970s.  In his own lifetime, Faurer exhibited mostly in group exhibitions, but had only about five solo shows.  This current retrospective is a long overdue gathering of most of Faurer's important works, which was first held at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, moved to San Diego, and is fittingly due at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in June 2003.<br />As for the printing of the book itself, it is first rate, and both the tones and the colours are extremely true to the originals.  Tucker's introductory essay is an excellent biographical sketch of Faurer the man, and Lisa Hostetler categorises Faurer within the realm of \\"Film Noir\\" photographers of his time, though she doesn't give enough background on the New York tabloid crime photographers such as Weegee and Osmund Leviness who defined what would later become the genre.  <br />Nonetheless, this book (and the exhibition from which it was drawn) finally establishes Faurer among the top tier of art photographers where he rightly belongs.	2002-12-12
US	42160210	R1YZQN42EQRK4C	3908247217	435125243	Unclassified - A Walker Evans Anthology: Se	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	Unlocking the Enigma	What did I learn from this wonderful tome?  Well, for one, it really fleshes out the seeming walking contradiction that was Walker Evans: A Bohemian who really *was* poor; A man so honestly in love with the French literature of his day that he went beyond the affectations of a dilletante and made some awkward attempts at his own stories, but also came up with some excellent translations; A progressive of the left who nonetheless had no use for New Deal phoney hacks; A man of letters, culture and taste who also had a great command over four letter words in his letters to Hans Skolle and James Agee (I love the &quot;hatred for&quot; lists compiled by the latter two -- totally politically incorrect).<br />Walker Evans was a brilliant photographer, therefore was a bitter man, because he observed life so keenly; the warts took on an almost surreal dimension.  Nonetheless, he could always see beyond the muck and mire, and it is his bittersweet reflections on life that have the ring of honesty, integrity and a sort of sour, cynical truth, but never &quot;truth with a capital 'T'.&quot;  <br />I feel after reading this collection of elusive ephemera that I now truly can begin to understand what made Walker Evans tick.<BR>I recommend reading this while imbibing rum and Cokes or a fine Bordeaux Rouge.	2002-11-13

However, the problems of race and class that defined much of the black experience in America at the time of its writing still hold for today.  And, while I agree with Steele's general assessment of the state of black America, and especially with the solutions he outlines, I do agree somewhat with his critics, black or otherwise, who believes Steele tends to underplay the current levels of racism in our society.<br />However, here's the rub:  Racism can be an excuse to fail, or a reason to improve one's lot to the extent that blacks are empowered to make racism less relevant to their individual and collective destiny.  For what Steele is proposing is a return to the proud ethic first elaborated upon by such civil rights pioneers as Booker T. Washington and Marcus Garvey. <br />I give this excellent book four stars instead of five for the following reasons:  1).  As it was compiled mainly from magazine articles previously written by Steele, it is a bit repetetive, and; 2). Steele draws quite a bit on history of the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s, but I believe that by tracing many of our societal trends to the turn-of-the-century competing visions of Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. DuBois, this would have been a more well-rounded book.	2002-11-11

Of course, much favoured above Wilder/Crowe, namely because of Crowe's incessant name dropping of \\"Jerry Maguire\\" and \\"Tom Cruise\\" every other irritating sentence, which prevented the reader from finding out what<BR>Wilder had on *his* mind.<br />What impresses me about the Welles/Bogdanovich volume is the raucous sense of humour Welles brings to the conversation, always as lively and as larger-than-life as Welles was.  Also, Bogdanovich has laced the book with pertinent interviews, articles, anecdotes that elucidate certain points of the text, as well as Welles' lines cut from \\"Magnificent Ambersons\\" and the long memorandum he wrote to Universal studio chiefs and cc'd to Chuck Heston, trying to save what I consider his masterwork,<BR>\\"Touch of Evil\\" from falling prey to overzealous editing by indifferent studio hacks.<br />But most of all, I am touched that when all the world was dumping on Welles, when he was being derided as a has-been and a spendthrift, that up-and-coming director Bogdanovich gave him his friendship and accorded him the respect he was so shamefully denied.  Even Pauline Kael couldn't resist savaging Welles, and she wrote a particularly nasty and libelous article that Welles didn't write any of the screenplay to \\"Citizen Kane.\\"  <br />Of all Hollywood's sins (and I retain in memory a cross-indexed catalogue of them), the fact that even when Welles started getting \\"lifetime achievement\\" accolades, he still couldn't get any financing for his movie projects, on which he worked until his last days, leaves the bitterest taste in my mouth.  There must be certain people destined to the lowest rungs of hell -- or at least purgatory -- for creating a world in which Orson Welles' last paid acting role was as the voice of the evil planet in a \\"Transformers\\" movie.	2002-08-28

German photographer Albert Renger-Patzsch insisted that his photography was merely a matter of cataloguing of material phenomena, and that it represented a \\"new objectivity\\" (Neue Sachlichkeit).  He also insisted that he was simply a \\"recorder\\" of said objects.<br />That might strike people as odd, in this age when pretentious \\"post-modernists\\" defile Christ in urine, or actually sell cans of their own excrement to the Museum of Modern Art for tens of thousands of dollars, when *anything* and *everything* qualifies to be deemed as art, without any formal -- or toilet -- training necessary.  Yet, Renger-Patzsch disdained the moniker of \\"artist\\" that his enthusiasts tried to make stick to him.  I wonder if he would still have that attitude with all the literal crap that poses as art today.<br />Renger-Patzsch's photographs weren't merely objective, they were pure idealism, for he always arranged or composed the subjects of his photographs to be seen in their best light.  Whether it was simple pictures of common items, such as hand trowels, shoe trees or foliage, his photographs had a sensuous quality to them that makes the viewer want to reach into his photographs to touch them.<br />He had a gift for making the commonplace beautiful and for creating gorgeous landscapes out of factory works and basalt mines.  His industrial prints are contemporaneous with any of Charles Scheeler's or Margaret Bourke-White's, but bear a much subtler imprint; There is a quiet quality to his prints, in which man is either alone and isolated or conspicuously absent (as with his photographs of houses outside of Essen and Dortmund), but the handiwork of man is ever-present.<br />His photographs are very strong, nonetheless, very masculine.  He had a stylised eye that cut extraneous subject matter out of his images the way a butcher slices fat away from a side of bacon.  Yet, the beautiful, transparent delicateness of his photographs of glass beakers from the Schott Glassworks in Jena speak with a gentle, feminine voice and his photographs of enamel bowls or a child's Pelikan paintbox have a Japanese feel to them, in their iconic and minimalistic compositions.<br />It is sad to say that even most American enthusiasts of fine-arts photography have never heard of Albert Renger-Patzsch.  This volume, nonetheless, contains the best of his work and makes a strong argument for including him in the pantheon of the twentieth century's greatest photographers.k with a gentle, feminine voice and his photographs of enamel bowls or a child's Pelikan paintbox have a Japanese feel to them, in their iconic and minimalistic compositions.<br />It is sad to say that even most American enthusiasts of fine-arts photography have never heard of Albert Renger-Patzsch.

Adams' colour work, however, never represented much more than a curious footnote in the master craftsman's career; Adams' overwhelming importance is in how he brought breathtaking drama to his prints through his use of the zone system, and a refined, exacting, approach to the printing process.<br />Walker Evans, on the other hand, was almost the opposite of Adams in his approach to the finished photograph: His approach centered more on a refinement of composition, and of excising the non-essential and extraneous from his final prints.  Yet, along with Adams, he shared a disdain for colour photography -- both found it to be 'garish,' 'vulgar.'<br />However, this work -- which represents the final chapter in Evans' artistic life -- is a radical departure from his stated aversion to colour photography.  The story is equally intriguing.<br />As Walker Evans approached 70, divorced and in failing health, it seemed that his creative days were behind him.  He had produced some images since the mid 1960s, but it became increasingly difficult for him to have to schlep around his cumbersome view camera and tripod.  Quite fortuitously, though, the Polaroid corporation sent Evans its SX-70 auto-focus camera and an unlimited supply of film, hoping that the prestige of Evans' name would have help market its latest camera.  Suddenly, Evans found his artistic 'second wind,' and began manically snapping up instant photographs with this simple camera he referred to affectionately as 'the toy.'<br />In the last two and-a-half years of his life, Evans would eventually take more than 2500 pictures with this camera.  The photographs contained within are pure Walker Evans:  Sometimes simple, sometimes complex, but always perfect compositions, always ruthlessly cropped within the camera.  Evans commented about this camera \\"that nobody should touch a Polaroid until he's over sixty.\\"  Yet, viewing Evans' prints, which combines a colourful joy de vivre within the context of refined taste, it becomes obvious that anyone aspiring to the title of 'artist' or 'serious photographer' should not be permitted to advance to medium format or large format view cameras until he's mastered the art of composition with this seemingly innocuous 'toy.'  Keep in mind that the photographs within are in the shape of a perfect square, a much more difficult canvas on which to let the compositional elements coalesce than the easy rectangle offered by 35mm cameras.<br />Many of the plates in 'Polaroids' were first published in earlier volumes, such as 'Walker Evans: The Hungry Eye' (1993) and the Metropolitan Museum of Art's 2000 retrospective, which along with this volume, was also edited by Jeff Rosenheim.  The only drawback to this book, is that the photographs are printed 1:1 to the actual prints (just  3-1/8\\" sqaure) and are somewhat darker than in the two previous volumes, obscuring some detail.  Also, the colours have also faded since the two previous volumes' release, showing just how fragile the Polaroid medium is.<br />Nonetheless, this volume was worth every penny I paid for it:  There is such a serendipitous element of wry humour, even whimsy, that is both intimate and charming, and relate to the viewer Evans' essentially benevolent outlook on life, much of which had been brought back by this 'toy.'<br />Many of the photographs are purely abstract, but some are also literal in nature:  Breaking down lettering in signage and from traffic markings, Evans attempted to collect a series of all the letters of the alphabet in idealised form.  There are also some photos of signs that are witty puns (such as the 'IQ' isolated from a 'LIQUOR' sign) or double-entendre, such as the railway placard 'DO NOT HUMP.'<br />But best of all are his simple compositions of ordinary objects, such as agarden spade, a half-eaten blueberry pie, kitchen utensils, a mailbox, a dress-makers manequin and -- of course -- signs.  Evans took deceptively prosaic objects, photographing them in an almost 'objective,' documentary manner, yet endowed them with his intelligent sense of selective observation.  In his introduction, Rosenheim noted Evans' 1971 comment in relating Evans' aesthetic method:  'The secret of photography is, the camera takes on the character and the personality of the handler.  The mind works on the machine -- through it, rather.'<br />In his adolesence, Walker Evans dreamed of becoming an author, a literary man of letters.  He found out, however, early-on that he was better-suited to photography.  But in the twilight of his years, he left the world his final chapter in the story of his life, this collection of Polaroids.  These delicate, sardonic and bittersweet images more than fulfill his early aspirations, for all their visual prose and poetry.	2002-08-01
US	42160210	RUXEMKX5Z2RLU	0312113714	495663720	Olympia	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Man as Athlete: Leni Captures the Olympic's Hellenic Spirit	In the 1937 preface to the first edition of this book, Leni Riefenstahl remarked 'it is the timeless document of a great idea -- a hymn to beauty and competetive endeavour.'  Sixty-five years later, the graceful images of athletes competing in the 1936 Berlin games has more than withstood the test of time and validated Riefenstahl's original estimation of this work's ground-breaking importance, not only as a document, but as an exercise in the aesthetics of the idealised beauty of the human body in movement.<br />Leni Riefenstahl was something of a Renaissance woman: Photographer, motion picture director, editor, dancer, skier, and all-around athlete, no one could have been a better match for  documenting the 1936 Olympics on film, from which stills were culled to create this volume.  True to the spirit of Ancient Greece, it is fitting that it was captured on silver nitrate by this gifted cinematographer christened Helene (her birth name, for which 'Leni' is a German nickname).  <br />Actually, the term 'stills' does injustice to the photographs contained with -- so alive are they, capturing the essence of athleticism and motive power.<br />The beginning of the book is devoted to Ancient Greece, and documenting the ruins which monumentalise her greatness: The Parthenon, Myron's discus thrower, the gods, such as Apollo and Achilles.  Riefenstahl has brought many of the famous statues of athletes alive, as she photographs naked men and women engaged in the ancient sports, such as the javelin throw, the shot put, eurythmics, dance and the discus throw.  Her athletes epitomise the grace, sensuousness and taut, muscular efficiency of the male and female bodies.  <br />Another striking sequence is of the young Greek torch bearer, who ignites the torch at Athens and delivers it on his long route through Thermopaylae, the Grecian shore, Delphi and Corinth.  The poise and determination in the runner's body and eyes convey the Olympic spirit with the same glowing certitude asthe eternal flame, which the runner holds aloft like a beacon in the night.<br />Once in Berlin, the bulk of this volume is dedicated to the athletes themselves.  Leni's cameramen captured all the events, and some of the images are just astounding for their sense of motion and eloquent simplicity of composition.  Among my favourites are: p. 60, the Flame from Greece, which shows a German youth standing before the crowd of athletes, holding the flame erect before lighting the stadium torch; p.62, Start of the 80 meter hurdles, as seen from the timekeeper's point-of-view, the lines demarcating the oval track's lanes sweep into a bird's eye view of the pensive hurdlers as they await the starter's gun; p. 68, Jesse Owens in the starting blocks, the great athlete is the very embodiment of concentration; pp. 98, 99, German Gisela Mauermayer, discus thrower, shows the female athlete in motion, and in joyous release on her way to the gold medal; p. 137, shadows of marathon runners, which convey the fleeting rush of the events; p. 247, finale, which shows the Berlin Olympicstadion encircled by pillars of searchlights just before the flame is extinguished.<br />'Olympia' is, to me, the greatest expression of graceful motion ever captured by a photographer.  A tone poem for camera, these images better convey the concept of motion than 99% of the movies today, which are motion pictures in name only.	2002-07-23
US	42160210	RBK4D0NRCSGGW	0821219804	387503177	Ansel Adams in Color	Books	2	6	12	N	N	Will the Real Ansel Adams Please Stand Up......	Many reviewers make quite clear a fact about Ansel Adams regarding his own colour photography: That he did not want it published, for his own lack of control over the medium was substandard to the exacting methods he employed in his black-and-white prints. Without reservation, agreed.<br />But what most of Ansel Adams' most fervent admirers won't admit was that this book of colour prints made from transparencies belie the legendary artist's alleged \\"genius\\" for composition. Many of the compositions within are colour versions of famous black-and-white prints, the most famous being Half Dome at Yosemite. <br />I wish that aspiring photographers' introduction to Ansel Adams be similar to that of a Japanese photography assistant I once employed. She had never seen Adams' work (not as popular in the Far East as in the States) prior to this book. Her words regarding this book were \\"he takes pleasant photographs of pretty subjects in nature.\\" I later introduced her to Adams' black-and-white \\"greatest hits\\" that Little, Brown, also published. Her assessment: \\"His compositions are generally conventional, but not novel. But, with a red filter while shooting and many darkroom methods and formulas, he uses technique to bring drama to his prints.\\"<br />Ditto. It was refreshing to hear this opinion of Adams, because my friend did not have the yoke of artistic correctness hanging about her neck to remind her to speak of Adams in reverent, hushed, tones as some great \\"master\\" as though he were the photographic equal of Rembrandt, Vermeer or Rodin.<br />What Adams' admirers most fear about this book is that it will lay waste to all the decades of carefully designed PR Adams' publicity machine and his heirs have promulgated in their hagiographic transmogrification of a pretty good artist and a peerless technician into \\"St. Ansel.\\"<br />The truth of the matter was that Ansel Adams made pretty pictures of pretty landscapes. And, that's what you'll get in this book. If you want the illusion of great art, turn to any of his volumes in black-and-white.<br />But, if you want truly great, earth-shattering black and white photography that inspires both intellect and emotion, then turn to the true masters: Walker Evans, Albert Renger-Patzsch, Robert Frank and Leni Riefenstahl.	2002-07-13

I have re-read it many times in my late teens and early twenties, but did not return to it again until last year, in Berlin, at the age of 36. Well, a lot has changed in my life since.  I guess in that sense, my own story is somewhat different than many reviewers here: Although I considered myself an Objectivist until my mid-20s, I fortunately took Rand at her word, and made up my own mind on issues Randist.  So, even when the revelations came out in the 1980s of what a maniacal and cult-like figure she was, I never felt the sense of betrayal so many others did.  Actually, I kind of felt sorry for her, and for the people she manipulated and duped.  Life is too short to give and demand blind worship and obedience to some celebrity.<br />Sum it up to say, if you're looking for \\"I read 'The Fountainhead' as a teenager, but now -- ouch, I can't believe what an awful piece of turgid nonsense this is,\\" look elsewhere, not here.  On the other hand, those people are welcome to their opinions.  Neither am I a dyed-in-the-wool Objectivist Randroid, who will tell you that \\"The Fountainhead\\" is the greatest novel ever written.  When I was 17, I fervently believe it was; I don't now.  People read more, they develop new tastes.  So, for me the greatest novel ever is Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness.\\"  But, that doesn't mean that I'm going to swing to the other extreme and deride it into the ash can.<br />I agree with many reviewers that \\"The Fountainhead\\" is adolescent.  But, it is not adolescent in the same sense that \\"Beavis and Butt-Head\\" or \\"American Pie\\" is.  \\"The Fountainhead\\" captures that confused yet clear-headed sense of anticipation, loneliness, grandeur and fear of failure that make up the contradictory state of our teenage years, rather much like J.D. Salinger's writing did for some, Daniel Clowes' \\"Ghost World\\" does today, and Hunter S. Thompson's \\"The Rum Diary\\" did for me later on.  It is rather revealing that manyreviewers recoil from their adolescent fervor for \\"The Fountainhead,\\" because adolescence is an awkward, confusing and often embarassing time.  It is fraught with heartbreak, social faux-pas and immaturity.  But I have never felt the need to disassociate from my adolescent self, and this is why I can reflect upon this book more objectively (no pun intended), yet still appreciate it for its strengths.<br />One of the hallmarks of this book's adolescent spirit is that it is a paean to individualism and never selling out.  Of course, reality gives us all a swift kick in the rear, but I stopped confusing \\"The Fountainhead\\" with reality around the same time I started having to shave daily. There is no sadder a scene than seeing Rand's acolytes and detractors waging life-or-death battle over this book and her philosophy.  It reminds me of all the rather more rabid history buffs reliving and refighting the American Civil War. Come on, \\"The Fountainhead\\" is fiction, Rand died 20 years ago, and no-one is scared any longer of Leonard Peikoff's excommunicating temper tantrums, so lighten up out there! <br />The old cliche goes 'No-one has yet written the great American novel.' Well, in the sense that it must encompass all things American, no. To me, if a novel catches the _essence_ of America, that qualifies it.  Sinclair Lewis' \\"Elmer Gantry,\\" Ernest Hemingway's \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" Stephen Crane's \\"The Red Badge of Courage,\\" Mario Puzo's \\"The Godfather,\\" all these qualify in my mind for that elusive title.  And so does Ayn Rand's \\"The Fountainhead\\" captures the spirit of America. I loved it thoroughly. Her characters are larger than life, the message of being true to one's self, and not selling out, sorely needed today. Rand expertly contrasts the novel's hero, Howard Roark - an uncompromising architect - with the tragic Gail Wynand, a newspaper baron who, like Othello, is a flawed hero, and whose quest for power and domination leads him to almost destroy that which he loves most. Actually, I DID find Roark a bit wooden (but not as wooden as Gary Cooper's portrayal of him in the 1949 movie).  Really, Gail Wynand is the most believable main character in this book, because he's torn by dillemma.  His is a character of tragic dimensions, rather like Orson Welles' Charles Foster Kane (who, like Wynand, was also based on William Randolph Hearst).  When Wynand sells out Roark, it isn't a betrayal so much of Roark, but of Wynand's own soul, and this is why I cry for Wynand.  Because of his basic fatal flaw.  Wynand chose damnation over redemption, rather much like Michael Corleone did in \\"The Godfather Part II\\" when he ordered and watched his brother Fredo's execution.  I can't countenance THAT being labelled \\"two-dimensional\\" or \\"cardboard\\" at all.  It is the great tragedy of the story.  <br />Ellsworth Toohey is the story's Iago, a small, cunning manipulator who himself tries to use Wynand's greatness to destroy Roark. Because of Wynand's own fatal flaw, he refuses to acknowledge Toohey's ability to influence and control.<br />I especially love the book's Roaring '20s and Depression-Era feel. Rand may have painted her heroes in romantic, Nietzshean brushstrokes, but her characterisations of her villains and non-heroes is sardonic and small, and owe's much to the naturalistic novels of Sinclair Lewis and the newspaper columns and book reviews of H.L. Mencken.  Her desciption of Stanton, Mass. -- tight, manicured, exhibitionist lawns in front of crackerbox houses -- is right out of Lewis' \\"Main Street\\" or \\"Babbitt.\\"  <br />And, close your eyes - you'll see a Hell's Kitchen as painted by Edward Hopper and Roark's skyscrapers as photographed by Alfred Stieglitz.<br />\\"The Fountainhead\\" may not be the greatest novel ever written, but it IS great.	2002-07-12
US	42160210	RY7JTL7SDDR26	1560974273	582435172	Ghost World	Books	4	9	10	N	Y	Like the comic book, love the movie	I have a theory about books vs. movies:  If you read the book first -- it being your introduction to the story -- then the movie will be a bit of a letdown.  Since I saw the movie first, based on a friend's recommendation, I went out and bought the book afterwards.<br />The comic book is darker and monochromatic, versus the movie's beautiful use of primary and pastel colours.  That makes the book and movie equal for me, and gives one the choice of alternate \\"Ghost\\" worlds.  But the book is written in episodic installments, and is therefore less unified than the movie; like many comic books, this one is an ongoing serial, and works great as a character study.<br />Where the movie departs from the book is the development of a plot which involves one of the book's minor characters (the bearded guy with whom Enid and Rebecca make a fake blind date as a practical joke).  In the movie, the bearded guy is shorn of his facial hair and re-emerges as Seymour (played by Steve Buscemi) as the catalyst for a major tunrning point in Enid's life.  I really think that by collaborating with director and screen-writer Terry Zwigoff that Clowes made a work of art a masterpiece.<br />Nonetheless, I found the book very compelling, but really do recommend reading it before seeing the movie.  I really like Daniel Clowes' stripped-down, stylised drawings.  Like the movie, you can really get lost in this book.  That's a lot coming from me, because I don't get into most comic books.  This one, though, speaks to me.	2002-05-04
US	42160210	R1AJXVVN94FIDD	0375406603	203214903	Conversations with Wilder	Books	4	13	15	N	N	Not quite as thorough as Hitchcock/Truffaut	Cameron Crowe does a great job of getting Billy Wilder to \\"open up,\\" for certain. There was many interesting anecdotes and facts I previously did not know, so this book is the page-turner everyone proclaims it to be. Crowe does a good job at kibbitzing an answer out of the somewhat stubborn Wilder. However -- since Crowe consciously based the format of this book on the Hitchcock/Truffaut interviews of 1966 -- it is lacking in certain areas. <br />Firstly, many of the photographs are horribly transferred stills from the movies, which were taken from video, not film. The pixelization is sometimes so horrible as to wipe out almost half of the information. As there are many more photos done by this makeshift method (most of the others are publicity stills or of Wilder, Hollywood movie stars, etc, not from the actual movies), it would seem to me that the publisher (not some dinky independent, but Alfred A. Knopf, major player over here) could have gone the extra mile and made some high-quality stills from the studios' answer prints. Since they didn't, however, this volume appears \\"rushed to market.\\"<br />Second, Crowe's organization is horrible: Unlike Hitch/Truffaut, it sort of meanders from movie to movie and then back again. It's organized chronologically (by interview session, not movie), and often goes back over movies already discussed, because Crowe forgot some question or another. Also, Crowe doesn't go much into the bit players and character actors at all. I mean, HOW COULD HE GO AN ENTIRE VOLUME ON BILLY WILDER WITHOUT EVER MENTIONING SIG RUMAN (who was to Wilder as Leo G. Carroll was to Hitch) or Cliff Osmond?<br />Perhaps, it's because Crowe spends more time dropping the name \\"Jerry Maguire\\" every other page or so (as long as he was shamelessly self-plugging, why not \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High,\\" a much better movie?). Tom Cruise -- who's never been in a Wilder movie -- is listed in 10 different pages in the index.  Also (unlike Truffaut) Crowe goes to great lengths in order to insert himself into the text, including going over a house call by Wilder's doctor, a lunch with Wilder and his wife, phone calls Wilder is taking , etc. (in Hollywood, these are called \\"gratuitous scenes\\").<br />Lastly, the end notes list (with big backdrops of those horrible pictures from VHS) the credits, but they are very incomplete, and don't list most of the technicians or supporting cast.<br />All-in-all this book is very good, but heavy editing is needed to give it a semblance of chronology, and Crowe's gratuitous and voluminous self-referencing really could do with a ruthless editor's red pen. That, and some quality stills, would have made a good read a classic.	2002-01-19
