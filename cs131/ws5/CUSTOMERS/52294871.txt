Without blowing his own horn, the author exposes how to be a good human being.  The story is also captivating, but what is behind the story is the good part.  Tom Sutherland is an amazing human being, to have undergone captivity at the hands of terrorists, yet come out of it a better person.  Jean Sutherland's parts fill in the corners well, both write very well.	2005-06-19
