As hard as it is to live in poor conditions, unfortunately people find it more difficult to accept the hardship -- the challenge -- involved in making a better living.  Thus, they accommodate their poverty, and it lingers from year to year, even decade to decade. A brilliant insight and a book for the ages.	2005-05-24

The author bases his findings \\"on decades of research with business executives around the world.\\"  The book offers time tactics, interviews, and traditional time management tools. With 500,000 copies sold in previous editions, it's among the most popular time management books available.  This is puzzling, because compared to others in the field, The Time Trap contains many long, boring stretches. Based on the theory that self-management is the key to handling a time crunch, it focuses on the author's 20 biggest time wasters, such as telephone interruptions, the inability to say \\"no,\\" and personal disorganization.  It then offers step-by-step instructions on how to combat them.        The updated, third edition includes information on time problems caused by technology, downsizing, and self-employment, added almost as an afterthought.  The fundamental shortcoming of the book is the underlying premise that readers can be taught \\"how to squeeze the optimal efficiency and satisfaction out of their workday.\\"  This might have been a valid approach in the 1970s, but in an era when people are already squeezed out, they need other approaches.	2005-05-24

Lakein is considered to be the godfather of time management by the business community.  His popularity was so enormous in the mid to late 1970s that he even appeared as a guest on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. The information presented is sound, in that even to this day, many <br />can benefit from reading this book. Indeed most of what has been written on time management since Lakein's book largely rehashes what he said. <br /> <br />Time marches on.  Lakein wrote the book at a time when the world population was a little more than half of what it is today.  Understandably, he doesn't address the changing structure of the family, the problems of the two-career family, or rearing children.  Also, there is little coverage of the impact <br />of technology on the use of one's time. Lakein offers masterful tips for overcoming procrastination, but he leaves out a variety of new approaches that could make profound differences in readers' lives.  Still, there is much worth knowing in this slender text, and it can aid readers. <br />	2005-05-24

Now, four years since its publication date, the book has not fared nearly as well as one might expect from the genre's godfather.	2005-05-24

First Things First attempts to show readers how to look at their use of time to help create a balance between their personal and professional responsibilities by \\"putting first things first\\"  and acting upon them. Covey teaches an organization process that helps the reader categorize tasks so that he or she can focus on what is important, not merely what is urgent. Many insights within the book are profound, e.g. \\"Doing more things faster is no substitute for doing the right things.\\"  The real human needs are \\"to live, to love, to learn, to leave a legacy.\\"        The quintessential advice is first to lay out your life in four quadrants labeled urgent, not urgent, important, and unimportant. A task may have a deadline but not much importance; or, a task may be important but require preparation and planning. The authors say that one should stop doing what's unimportant and without urgency. Where the important and the urgent intersect is where you need to expend most of your energies, so the theory goes. Assuming that urgency announces itself, the real question is knowing what's important, and the authors draw from a variety of sources to guide you toward determining what is important.        At nearly 400 pages, overloaded with concepts, sometimes explained in a way that makes ideas even more complex than they are, the book requires concentration to get through it.  It has sold well and is considered one of the anchors of the genre.	2005-05-24

Stephanie Winston, also author of Getting Organized, presents a wealth of ideas for managing time, paper, and people more effectively.  While she offers sound time- and task-management skills such as \\"the art of organization,\\"  \\"effective filing techniques,\\" and other ways to promote efficiency, the book is packed with charts, exhibits, and \\"systems\\" and hence requires energetic readers.        It does not address the mental/spiritual aspects of staying organized and in control -- something readers want and, more importantly, need.	2005-05-24

This company conducts time management seminars for corporations, organizations, and government agencies.  Franklin Covey also sells a wide variety of day-planners, scheduling books, calenders, and other time management tools.        Smith contends, and rightly so, that there is more to managing time than getting things done. By understanding one's own value system, he says, one can decide what matters most, set priorities, and accomplish goals.  The marketing strength of the company keeps the book alive.	2005-05-24
