US	52741176	R1ITP3ITL5ADFB	0451141075	923131274	The Rockefellers	Books	4	36	37	N	N	Uneven but revealing	The Collier-Horowitz team have done at least three of these dynasty biographies, this one being their first.  The biggest problem they have had in their project of writing on the Rockefellers, Fords and Kennedys is that  they are often dependent on a few sources, especially when researching  contemporary family goings-on.  Maybe because it was their first stab at  the dynasty biography, the problem is most acute with the Rockefellers.   The founder of the dynasty, John D. Senior, is given less space than John  D. Junior, almost as if Collier-Horowitz is saying &quot;Senior has been  done by others; let's nail down the more obscure Junior.&quot;  And they do  fill in the details of Junior's life rather well.  The professional lives  of the third generation, the five brothers, are rather well done but the  personal lives are almost ignored.  This is a failing because the reader  can not understand why the fourth generation of Rockefellers have, for the  most part, happily rejected their family unless you know why the five  brothers were such abject failures as fathers.  The fourth generation comes  off, with only a couple of exceptions, as spoiled, childish brats filled  with loathing of all things Rockefeller.  David Rockefeller's children  especially seem to despise their father, family and country.  Abbie  Rockefeller is particularly odious.  Laura Rockefeller explains her own  generation succinctly when she says, &quot;the cousins are used to spending  and donating money but not producing.&quot;  The moral decay and personal  supineness of the vast majority of the fourth generation is striking.  It  is also interesting is that the first Rockefellers were very religious  people while the younger Rockefellers have turned their backs on religion.  The Rockefeller trusts may keep the Rockefeller family going financially  for several generations to come but as an important, vibrant family, the  Rockefellers are a family in collapse.	2000-03-31

Paley uses the FBI system of profiling serial killer suspects  and Barnett is an almost perfect fit.  To lend color to the crime and  criminal, the author paints a vivid picture of the slummier side of  Victorian England.	1999-09-03

US	52741176	RFAFUR12PSP4Z	0451191145	604964480	Atlas Shrugged	Books	5	3	8	N	N	Conditional Five Stars	Just for the author's hammer-like ridicule of the dominant socialistic mindset of this epoch, this novel deserves at least four stars.  Ayn Rand's biting, sarcastic humor carries the book.  Those several reviewers who  found Miss Rand humorless are too far gone in Left Wing La-La land to get  the fun the author is having at the expense of socialism's intellectual  pretensions.  Atlas Shrugged has weaknesses, thus the conditional five  stars.  Almost all of her characters have one dimensional personalities.   They're either wonderful and productive or evil and parasitical.  The  ninety page speech of John Galt is the height of egoism but to be expected  of a woman who thought herself the greatest philosopher since Aristotle.  Her philosphy has holes, too.  Dagney's sluttiness is made a virtue,  paralleling Ayn Rand's personal life around the time of Atlas Shrugged's  release. I heartily agree with the reviewer who would not like a world  without &quot;the likes of Mother Theresa&quot;.  Most probably, Ayn Rand  would consider Mother Theresa a sob sister.  What would a Rand objectionist  do for the retarded or the crippled or the orphaned-  throw them out into  the world to raise themselves like wolves?  I share the puzzlement of some  reviewers of the treatment of Eddie Willers at book's end.  Even Francisco  says that Willers shares the values of the heroes of Galt's Gulch if not  the superman abilities of the Galt Gulchers.  Perhaps Willers' demise is  Rand's way of explaining the future for  America's abused  productive  people- the looters will grind down the productive in the end. Lastly, I  find laughable the labeling of Rand as a fascist by several reviewers.   They ought to look up the word fascist in the dictionary and find that they  are bigger fools than they realized.	1999-08-15

However, the book is not without flaws.  The editing of this book is rather poor (ie. the balloon house construction method is referred to as ballroom  construction method) with at least a dozen typos, probably due to the fact  that the author suffered the loss of a teen-aged son in a car wreck just as  he was finishing the book.  He devotes little time to the radical  demographic changes in suburbia since World War Two, a situation leading to  a barren lack of continuity in suburban towns.  The author shies away from  most racial causes of the rise of suburbia and urban ethnic and racial  transformations.  Still, Professor Jackson brings to life what most  Americans consider a mundane, dull subject.  This is a job well done- I  wish he'd write another.	1999-08-15

Nixon is exposed, his warts and his decencies.  The petty, self-important Nixon is here, an old man given to  bitternesses, especially towards George Bush.  Bush was Nixon's protege and  semi-creation (if not for Nixon's sponsorship, Bush would have ended his  career as a failed Texas pol or minor cabinet secretary) yet Bush rarely  asked Nixon for the elder's advise- and Nixon pouted over the affront.   Nixon arrogantly considered himself one of America's greatest presidents, a  minority view amongst conservatives as well as liberals.  Nixon enjoyed the  flattery Bill Clinton sent his way.  Nixon's strong points come out in this  book, too.  He remained intellectual sharp until the end and intellectually  curious.  He was a quick study of personalities and situations.  He  understood what the icy Hillary Rodham Clinton was all about after one  short meeting.  He knew Ronald Reagan was having mental problems two years  before Reagan's public announcement of his Alzheimer's affliction.  My only  problem with Monica Crowley's book is that she uses quote marks for most  conversations though she admits that she didn't use a tape recorder.  She  claims she wrote notes after conversations- but who can have that perfect a  memory even if her notes were scribbled five minutes after a given  conversation took place. Still, Miss Crowley's book is fun and valuable.	1999-08-15

I would only add that eerily much of what caused Rome to dry rot and collapse is being mirrored in the USA- high taxation, large bureaucracies, the lack of desire to serve in the  military, radical racial diversification, growing elements of societal  drop-outs (ie. homeschoolers, Christians, environmentalists), complacency,  the growing gulf between social classes.  Will the USA fall like Rome?   After all, there is no army of barbarians at our doorstep like Rome faced.   We have no military coups unlike the dozens which took place in Rome.  But  there are several fits, enough to think that at the very least, America two  centuries from now will be as recognizable to us as modern England would be  recognizable to Alfred the Great, William the Conqueror or Richard the  Lionhearted.	1999-08-15

The howler is that the author thinks that the modern  conservative movement was led by Ronald Reagan, Irving Kristol and himself  (and not necessarily in that order) and a few lessers.  Further, Reagan and  Kristol abandoned the game; Reagan, by being re-programmed by Nancy and her  astrologer and Kristol, through Kristol's inordinate attention to the  plight of the New York Knicks basketball team.

However, the ghostwriter is talented, his style a synthesis of Hemingway and Mickey Spillane.  And Audie Murphy has a great and heroic tale to tell.   Murphy's war is a lot different than say Eisenhower's and Patton's.   Murphy became a master at small unit infantry tactics.  He was one of the  men.  Ike and Patton were masters of strategy and were not really part of  the men.  What Murphy's story also illuminates is it is often just pure  chance whether a soldier survives a war.  Two pals of his were wounded in  the right spots.  Another had his heart pierced by a small shell fragment.   Another buddy trusted a group of Germans faking a surrender and received a  chest full of German lead for his trouble.  For all those who liked the  fictional &quot;Battle Cry&quot;, you will like this book.	1999-06-15

Normally I find books devoted to airing out the dirty, personal details of a person's life, especially a recently dead person, repellant.  However, the silly, maudlin spectacle put on by tens of millions vicarious women  (and many feminized men) during Diana's funeral week makes this book the  perfect antidote.  This book rips the facade off an unintelligent and  self-centered brat princess so well loved throughout Britain, America and  the globe.  It is a sign of a decadent age that the lovely but empty-headed  Princess Diana is the most beloved modern British royal while the manly  Prince Philip, who had two ships shot out from under him in the fight  against Adolph Hitler, is the most despised modern royal.	1999-05-13

Mr. Cannandine's chooses not to explain the causes of the decline,  however, with any percision.  The various political reform acts, the rise  of a rootless proletariate, the democratization of education, the  agricultural decline starting about 1870, the decimation of young  aristocrats in the trenches of World War One, the loss of confidence in the  right to rule-these are either only briefly mentioned by Mr. Cannandine or  not mentioned by Mr. Cannandine.  He chose not to over-analyze.  My chief  criticism of the book is that in conclusion, Mr. Cannandine seems overjoyed  with the declining relevance of his subject.  That is a pity.  The British  aristocracy has done well by Britain.  It is sad that Mr. Cannandine has a  soulmate in Tony Blair, who is set to destroy the House of Lords this year.	1999-04-26

She is married to David Frum, probably the most brilliant young neo-conservative around, and  heir to a multi-million dollar fortune in Canada.  Though Miss Crittenden  calls herself conservative, there is nothing conservative about a woman  disrespecting her husband so much that she would keep her father's surname  rather than take her husband's.  Miss Crittenden and the many negative  female reviewers of this book are presumptuous in that they really believe  the average American woman spends much time analyzing what Betty Friedan  and the feminist movement means to them.  Your average American female has  little time for feminist intellectual games and I would guess that less  than ten percent of American women even know who Betty Friedan is. Only a  small elite with time on their hands (and with a maid, Miss Crittenden has  time) have the freedom to muse over the impact of feminism on their lives.   The majority of young women her age with kids, daughters of Iowa meat  packers, Kentucky tobacco farmers, Michigan auto workers, Washington  airplane rivetters and the like, are driven out into the labor force to  toil at jobs most don't really enjoy (so much more fun, Danielle, to work  at a keyboard speading one's ideas than, say, putting together plastic tool  chests in a Lima, Ohio plastics plant).  And why? The current economic  system dictates the two wage earner household due to the severe taxes  forced upon the common wage earner in order to subsidize the greedy elderly  masses of our country.  Miss Crittenden lives in a dream world-she can  afford to stay home with her kids. Millions of other young women with  children would gladly join her as a homemaker but there are taxes and bills  to pay.  However, a book that presents an ideal and also makes so many  feminists seethe with hatred can't be all bad.	1999-04-15

Mary Hemingway and various editors slapped this one together from an on-again, off-again project Hemingway wasn't able to complete during his  last decade of life due to his alcoholism, creaping schizophrenia and lack  of fire.  The sections of the book were meant to be virtually separate  books and they read that way.  Mark, the Calabrian reviewer, is right- the  Cuban section is terrible.  I believe Hemingway wrote much of it while  drunk.  The Bimini section is excellent except, having vacationed in Bimini  myself, Hemingway sugarcoats the place.  The Bimini he explains to his  readers is actually more like Abaco, Green Turtle Cay, Eluethera or, most  likely, Key West.  The At Sea section is also fine to read.  Funny, Islands  in the Stream is a case where the movie version (starring George C. Scott)  is probably of higher quality than the book.	1999-03-06

Alexander is more factual; Stump gives the reader a more thorough understanding of Cobb and his peculiarly ferocious personality. (The Alexander and Stump biographies  portray a man who is one part Bedford Forest, one part Patton, one part  Perot and one part Michael Jordan).  For instance, Alexander devotes little  more than one paragraph to Cobb's nervous breakdown in August, 1906.  On  the other hand, Stump details the inhumane hazing Cobb received from his  yankee teammates in 1906 due to southern upbringing which led to Cobb's  breakdown and fed his massive paranoia.  Stump does a much better job on  detailing Cobb's rivalry with Babe Ruth.  Alexander briefly mentions the  rivalry; Stump details the intense hatred Cobb felt for Ruth.  For example,  as player-manager of the Tigers, Cobb would often scream at the  thick-lipped Ruth from the dugout, &quot;You Nigga', Nigga' etc.,  etc..&quot; However, where Stump takes many of Cobb's stories and yarns at  face value, Alexander sifts through the clouds and tells the reader what is  definitely true and leaves out what might be lies.  Ty Cobb is the most  interesting baseball player of all time though not the most important  (Jackie Robinson, Babe Ruth, Roberto Clemente and, because of his role in  free agency, Catfish Hunter were more important than Cobb).  To get a real  good feel of Ty Cobb, you need to read two books.  Mr. Alexander's book is  one of the two.	1999-03-06

If you want to understand the psychology of stripping and the stripper, forget this book.  Miss Mattson has almost no ability to lend  the reader any mature introspection into the world of the stripper.  Author  is very much a me-me person as in &quot;I did this and I did that&quot;.   She has almost no analytical ability.  As an occasional frequenter of strip  clubs I can tell that little of the bitter truth of the stripper's  profession comes out in this book- the broken families most strippers come  from; the drug and alcohol problems most strippers have; the lack of  self-respect most strippers have for themselves; the dead end of a  profession that requires only young, nubile bodies of twenty year old gals  with older stripper's careers winding down by the age of 30.  Heidi  Mattson's alma mater, Brown,  is considered part of the Ivy League due to  tradition and not by it's current level of scholarship.  Miss Mattson,  along with another famous alumnus, Amy Carter, is further proof of Brown's  decline.  Back to the topic: there should be a book that intelligently  examines the stripping culture.  This book is not it.	1999-02-28

Perfect companion to the more plain facts Charles Alexander biography of Cobb; Stump does a more thorough job explaining Cobb's unusual  personality.  Among other things, Cobb was neurotic, paranoid, egocentric  and very selfish.  Calling him prickly or sandpapery does no justice to  explaining him.  In an era in which most of his peers had at least a touch  of bigotry,  Cobb's hatred of blacks was unnerving to them and to others.   Stump does a better job than Alexander in explaining the possible sources  of Cobb's neurosis- his mother's &quot;manslaughter&quot; of his father  when Cobb was 20 and about to go up to the Big Show in Detroit; the  inordinately vicious hazing he received from the older Tiger players  because he was Southern and they were Northerners and Midwesterners for the  most part (Remember, Cobb joined the Tigers only 40 years after Appomattox.   Even today, my experience with my Ohio father-in-law is one in which  Midwesterners haughtily think Southrons like me to be low-lifes. We are not  close.)  Three positive things about Cobb come to mind in Stump's work.   First, Cobb planted the seeds for the end of the pillar of sport's  serfdom-the reserve clause-thus initiating free agency.  Second, no player  was more intelligent, on or off the field.  Third, no player had more drive  than Cobb.  Ironically, he compares well to the equally driven Michael  Jordan.	1998-12-28

This collection of essays and articles reflects the mindset of a gentleman who wishes to conserve what is best from history.  He has a few novel theories.  Nationalism, not ideologies like Nazism,  Communism and Fascism, has been the root cause for most of this century's  struggles.  One can disagree with Prof. Lukacs but one must respect his  view.  He hints in some fifteen year old essays that Europe would  de-Americanize; as the age of the Euro nears, Prof. Lukacs was prescient.   His theory on mountains and romanticism is fascinating.  Before the English  initiated Romanticism in the early 1800s, mountains were considered  horrible.  Today, Prof. Lukacs says we love mountains and their beauty; we  are all romantics now.  My favorite vignette was Prof. Lukacs's touring of  Hitler's birthplace of Braunau on the 100th anniversary of Hitler's birth.   The good professor made a side-trip from Braunau to a small Austrian  village where a heroic peasant by the name, I believe, of Jagrstatter stood  up to the Nazis and refused to be drafted.  He was guillotined in 1943.  I  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.	1998-12-28

It often reads like one of those silly romance novels one sees at the literature sections of such famous bookshops as Walmart, K-Mart, Walgreens and B.Daltons.  It is filled  with irrelevant gossip, much of it more suitable for a luncheon of  late-middle aged hens rather than a serious biography.  The author's  interviews with Joan Crawford(one of Gable's many lovers) dominate too many  sections of the bio; much of what Miss Crawford says is taken at face value  with little to counter-balance her assertions.  Most undefensible is the  author's portrayal of intimate conversations as if she were there with a  microphone and tape recorder.  Many of the precise  &quot;conversations&quot; alleged by the author were between two people  long since dead.  How would Jane Ellen Wayne know precise conversations  between Louis B. Mayer and Clark Gable?  Both have been dead for over  thirty years.  Did the author interview either man from beyond the grave?   This technique of the author is most dishonest.  However, this biography  has some very good points.  Gable's early life and rise are covered in  great detail. The author's desriptions of the big studio milleu of pre-TV  Hollywood are interesting.  The author paints a thorough personality  portrait of Gable- his calculated decisions, his high sex drive, his  alcoholism, his love of the outdoors, his tight wallet.  Gable's marriage  to Carole Lombard is handled rather well.  Oddly, the Gable-Lombard  marriage reminds one of the marriage of the current First Couple in the  White House, only Carole Lombard is better looking and much, much better  humoured than Hillary R. Clinton and Clark Gable is much more manly than  Bill Clinton. Clark Gable is worthy of a fine biography; Jane Ellen Wayne's  is not it, however.	1998-12-05

MacLean is brilliant in painting a portrait of the type of tough, intelligent men who are the smokejumpers.  His telling of the tale of the disaster is gripping and detailed just  right.  By not being maudlin about the young men's deaths, a more dignified  grief is achieved.  The manly, uncomplaining lingering deaths of Sylvia and  Hellman will bring tears to the meanest of men.  MacLean is brilliant in  piecing together why these men met their disasterous fate and why three of  them were to survive.  MacLean gets a little plodding at book's end when he  tries to explain fire science-important work, to be sure, but dull to the  layman.	1998-11-10

I've read this twice and I understand the two or three sceptical reviews.  My own questions are these: 1) Why go through the Gobi instead of around it?  The American and the Lithuanian were educated men and, one would think, would have suggested skirting the Gobi even if it meant crossing back into parts of lightly-settled southern Siberia.  2)Instead of crossing the Himalayas at their highest point to get to India, why not cross in British Burma or even French (albeit Vichy) Indochina?  Japan was not at war with Britain or France until December, 1941 so both should have been considered safe havens.  If this is a true story, and I think it is, it is one of the most heroic, wonderful tales of our age.  We may be in store for independent research on the subject of this book shortly.  Actor George Clooney has the film rights to the book and his TV contract has, I believe, only a year remaining.

Reagan's tax cuts worked.  There is a great moral truth that people should retain their earnings rather than fork them over to the state bureaucracy.  Yet, the Reagan boom did not lift all boats.  The mediocre and the inept slipped backward in the 80s just as they have during the Clinton boom of the 90s.  The rise of the two wage-earner family, much of it forced on mothers due to economic circumstances (continued high taxes, the collapse of high wage, semi-skilled jobs) is a shame which neither Republican or Democrat or liberal or conservative have really attempted to tackle.  The press release, prevelant during the Clinton and Reagan booms, of &quot;We've created ___ million jobs in __ years&quot; is a lazy, stupid, dishonest sort of boast. The families of America would be better off with fewer but better paid jobs rather than a bunch of $8/hr. jobs. The New Class, either conservative or liberal, does not seem to understand it.

Caro tells how LBJ was molded by his neo-frontier upbringing in the parched soil of the Texas hill country.  Most important in the rise of LBJ was his service as Congressman Kleberg's chief staff aid.  As Kleberg's right hand man, Johnson was a ruthless and dynamic tyrant in running Kleberg's staff.  He badgered staff mercilessly and regularly whipped them and himself into working grinding 14-18 hour days.  This method of getting the job done right was successful but just a little bit inhumane.  It would be the Johnson way until his 1968 retirement.  Unfortunately, the LBJ way of treating staff would be adopted by scores and hundreds of political types since Johnson's time- imitation is often the most sincere form of flattery.  As a former staffer of TV political maestro John McLaughlin, I know the LBJ way is alive and well (in fact, I read Caro's book during my seven month sentence with Dr. McLaughlin).   Count modern political staff operations as part of LBJ's huge legacy along with Medicare, Medicaid, the Civil Rights revolution, the 55,000 American dead in Vietnam and, inadvertantly, the rise of the Republican Party in the South.	1998-04-18

London was a committed socialist and this story is a criticism of the capitalist system which ruled the modern world circa-1900.  London's view of capitalism was that it was brutal and dog-eat-dog.  This novel reflects London's interpretation.  London also writes as if he took much of Karl Marx's dialectic interpretation of human events to heart.  White Fang and most of the humans in contact with White Fang act in predictable ways because they are conditioned by the capitalist system to act accordingly.  White Fang and most people he has contact with have no free will; they are the slaves to the capitalist system.  We know now that the presumed replacement for capitalism, Marxist socialism, is all a bunch of rubbish but, then, because the rotton, perverse Marxist-Leninist experiment would not be tried until late-1917, London did not have the advantage of empirical trial-and-error.  Of course, a gentler mother-hen socialism has since prevailed but I am sure Karl Marx would find disappointment in it. Today, White Fang would be doted over by scores of bureaucrats and enjoy the benefits of government subsidized food, shelter, health, education and recreation.  White Fang is treated well by a nice family at book's end and he gradually becomes docile.  Maybe tough old Jack London was, at heart, a mother-hen socialist like Hillary Rodham Clinton.	1998-04-18

Technologies like the Worldwide Web have lubricated the flow of ideas; government hacks are too incompetent, lazy and stupid to crack down effectively on computer users.  Orwell, a democratic socialist, was anti-Stalinist to his core and this book is a brilliant attack on the whole Stalin machine.  Sometimes the best critics of a system or idea are those who share some of the same assumptions.  No right-winger has ever been as effective (with the possible exception of Solzenhitsyn) in bludgeoning Stalinism.  Orwell is unusually prophetic in his use of the Telescreen as a government propaganda device and indoctrinator.  Remember, television was in its infancy when Orwell wrote this book in the late 40s.  Television has become a propaganda device though it is not used as crudely as in the Big Brother state of Orwell's 1984.  Television has effectively dumbed down the population with insipid, trite programming to the point where the average bloke is as intellectually tame and lazy as the Julie Christie character in Fahrenheit 451 (one has to believe that Ray Bradbury was heavily influenced by 1984).  Television has numbed the brains of a majority in the Western world to where they are compliant to the whims and wishes of the current ruling classes.

Rousseau proved a barbarian, closer to Darwin's ooze than noble savage.  This vermin dumped five of his progeny in orphan homes where the odds of dying early were astronomical.  Shelley was a selfish freeloader, one step ahead of the debt collectors.  His selfishness led to the death of one of his young children.  Satre did well in German occupied Paris.  In comparison, fellow leftist Marc Bloch served in the Resistence and was executed in 1944.  A pseudo-feminist, Satre treated his women as sex objects to be discarded when he tired of them.  Brecht treated his women similarly.  A Commie, the evidence of Brecht's stupidity were the scores of corpses draped upon the wire along the Berlin Wall.  Lillian Hellman was a compulsive liar.  Hemingway was often a great liar.  If I were to question Johnson's analysis, it would be that I think he overstates Connelly's influence.  Johnson condemns Connelly as a guiding light for the moral decadence that rose to ascendence in the mid-1960s.  Actually, Hugh Hefner, Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Mick Jagger and the pampered university children of the 60s are far more to blame.	1998-03-10

Fest fleshes out the young Hitler in fascinating detail.  Especially interesting is Fest's account of Hitler's political rise in Weimar Germany from being a member of a minute political party which held its meetings in the back of a beer hall to a dynamic leader of a strong poltical party by the end of the 1920s.  Fest is very interpretive and analytical.  Typical is his suggestion that Hitler was an artist mutated into a politician.  For an American like myself, Fest is weak in explaining how the Nazi's, who never achieved more than fifty percent of an honest vote, was able to dominate the apparatus of government so thoroughly and so fast upon joining a governing coalition in 1933. It has never happened in America even if America has had pols with tyranical personality traits- Wilson, Johnson, Nixon, Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt and, to a small degree, FDR.  If the amateur historian has time for only one biography of Adolph Hitler, this is the one to get.	1998-03-09

Orwell's fitful rise as a writer is especially interesting.  Prof. Shelden explains Orwell's various ideological wars and paints a portrait of a non-doctrinaire, humanist socialist who was a more astute critic of Stalinism or ideological socialism than anyone to his right.

Brimelow understands that America can not settle tens of millions of Latin American peasants and remain the America of OUR Fathers- George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams etc., etc.  Already, Hispanic, Black and White Leftist scholars have signaled that they wish to consign America's past to the burial grounds and remake America in their own warped, sick image.  They must be fought, says Brimelow.  Brimelow points to several polls which show that Americans want immigration, both legal and illegal, cut back severely.  Why are the polls ignored?  Because the  chieftains of the two political parties are for massive immigration- the Democrats because Third Worlders vote Democrat; Republicans because 1) Third Worlders are a source of cheap labor for Republican big business and 2) a scattering of silly, utopian Republicans of the Jack Kemp/Spencer Abraham/Newt Gingrich mold.

It is a book of facts.  Typical are facts regarding black college degrees. Blacks tend to get degrees in the easiest majors- sociology, social work, government management, teaching- and get very few degrees in the more difficult disciplines like mathematics and the sciences (some school years, zero blacks graduate with Mathematics degrees).   However, Taylor does little to explain the black man's problems in adapting to the Information Age. Agricultural workers for most of their time in America, blacks adapted poorly to industrialization and, if not for affirmative action, would adapt poorly to the information age.  Blacks have had success in sports, entertainment and government but the first two are accessible to only the very talented or very lucky of any race. Government, especially with the black political takeover of scores of big cities, is the great economic refuge of the blacks today and a major reason why the black middle class is so much bigger today than, say, in 1968 when Martin Luther King was murdered.  Mr. Taylor does do a good job explaining the black dependence on government largesse.  Why are blacks so Democratic?  Because the government furnishes middle class employment on one end and alms for the economically incompetent on the other end.   Mr. Taylor discredits affirmative action without explaining specifically why blacks instinctively know that affirmative action is vital to their economic well-being.  One needs to read between the lines to comprehend that Taylor knows how dependent blacks are on affirmative action.  Mr. Taylor is somewhat disingenuous when he challenges blacks to quit hiding behind affirmative action and better themselves by competing with other Americans without the bootstrap of affirmative action.  Strong black intellects like Thomas Sowell and Walter Williams may not need affirmative action but most blacks quite rightly realize that their economic status would decline if they had to compete head-to-head with white and orientals.  I feel sure Mr.Taylor knows this but he, like Pat Buchanan, must use this line of argument to attack affirmative action.  Declaring oneself against affirmative action because it is explicitely anti-white would open the door to being condemned as a racist and nobody in public affairs can allow that label to be pinned on himself no matter how bright you are.   The flaws of this book are easily outnumbered by its virtues.  Buy this book.  Tell your family to read it.  Tell your friends to read it.	1998-02-14

Yes Frum knows all the frauds for what they are.   Frum's declaration that Pat Buchanan is a socialist borders on the insane.  Yet Frum's personal hatred of Buchanan borders on the insane. Why?  Possibly because Buchanan is more brilliant than David Frum.  Possibly because Frum knows that conservatives tune in to Crossfire and The McLaughlin Group because of Buchanan.  No other conservative, not even David Frum, has that sort of following.  Not even close.  Possibly because Buchanan isn't obedient to the Israelis lobby and Frum is Jewish.  Frum's vindictiveness towards Buchanan is famous in conservatism's ranks; his attack of Buchanan in The American Spectator in 1991 not only widened the chasm between paleo-conservatives and neo-conservatives to the point where the two sides (briefly united during the Reagan Administration and the Cold War) are at open, blood curdling warfare but also cost  The American Spectator hundreds of subscriptions, including mine.     One last note on this would-be conservative Pope.  David Frum is married to Danielle Crittenden.  She is intelligent but a &quot;conservative&quot; feminist(an oxymoron, right) to boot.  Obviously, she has chosen to not take her husband's last name.  Both forget that one of the things conservatism is all about are traditions.  Conservative traditions include the wife taking the husband's surname and the male head-of-household.  David Frum, so quick to condemn other conservatives for deviating from the true creed, ought to consider some of his own deviations from the conservative creed.	1998-02-14

Orwell's mastery of the language combined with his unusual perceptiveness of the ordinary person's ordinary life makes this a swell read.  Drop your textbook histories of England from 1900-1939 and read this book.  It tells you more about England of that time period than any pulp filled with stats and dates.  And it's so much more entertaining.	1998-02-11

Details dull and often grueling routine of the trench soldier.  A few hellish moments- a rat chewing on a German corpse, Lt.Vaughn's sharing a shellhole with a rotting corpse for a half-day, Vaughn dropping his well-earned steak in three feet of trench mud, nervous men revealing that they felt a little &quot;windy&quot;.  Well-worth reading.	1998-02-11

The writing is dense and almost defeated me early on.  Perserve, don't put the book down.  It will grow on you and you with it.  By the time you read two books of the O'Brian series you will be fast friends with Aubrey and Maturin and enemies with Napoleon Bonaparte.	1998-02-11

The reader is impressed by the simple, vital pleasures of the life that the Morgan family experiences.  Industrial capitalism takes its toll on the family and community, proof that capitalism is often not conservative in its effects.  The several Morgan boys are driven from their family home because of the stresses and wild cycles of early industrialism.  The town in which the Morgan's live, once a community of friends, gradually becomes a mean, more brutal town by book's end.  Think not, however, that the author, Richard Llewelyn, is some sort of foaming-at-the-mouth Marxist.  He is critical of industrial capitalism from a conservative point-of-view.	1998-02-10
