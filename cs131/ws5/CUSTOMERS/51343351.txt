Saying that all pregnancies are different and that juggling two (or more) kids is a challenge isn't exactly earth shattering news. Very few of the subjects in this book are really explored in depth. I agree with the reviewer who said this book is like something you'd expect from a magazine. It hits on several good topics but doesn't really say a lot about any of them. I got more out of re-reading the books I had with my first pregnancy. This book felt like a waste of time. I don't really think it's worth the money.	2005-01-13

I have more of a tendency toward the natural and holistic approach to childbirth, and this books seemed to fit the bill.  While I did appreciate the section on avoiding episiotomies and some of the info on VBAC's, overall I was frustrated with and disappointed in The Thinking Woman's Guide. The author seems to have a true mistrust of doctors and hospitals. While I agree that sometimes \\"modern medicine\\" intervenes when it isn't necessary, I'm not going to second guess every little thing my provider says and does. How can you enjoy your birth experience if you're paranoid that whole time? Some parts of the book are confusing. On one page, the author says that in order to have a \\"safe\\" vaginal birth, women should avoid epidurals and other pain killers. But literally on the next page she says for a \\"positive\\" birth experience, you should *plan* to have an epidural. So, you're telling me it's not safe, but I should do it anyway? Huh?? The section that I found most upsetting is where the author talks about husbands as labor coaches. She basically says that no husband really wants to be a labor coach and men aren't typically very nuturing or instructive during labor anyway, so all women should hire a doula. Your husband should just sit in the corner waiting around to cut the cord. I found this ridiculous, and my husband (who was an outstanding labor coach during the birth of our first child) was offended. This book was definitely not worth the money I paid for it. I highly recommend looking around for a different guide for your pregnancy and birth.	2004-06-07

Everything in the 40-30-30 ratio. Every meal, every snack. Sounds simple enough. I read the book and found it all very informative. They discuss insulin levels and balancing your hormones. A lot if it was geared toward physical performance, like that of Olympic swimmers who got better times when they were &quot;in the Zone.&quot; I didn't feel like the book was confusing. But putting it all together and actually doing the diet was another story. It requires a lot of planning and seems to require a lot of math. The ratio business sounds easy, but trying to use it when eating an actual meal and not just a cup of this and 3 ounces of that is very difficult. If you're truly committed to the principles and theories presented here, then you can make it work, lose weight, and look great. But I think that the average reader will get too frustrated to really make a go of the Zone.	2003-03-14

It's so interesting to see what image people have when they hear a certain name. Of course we're all influenced by movies, TV, and real-life acquaintences. Some of the influences listed in the this book are a bit outdated. For example, the name Ariel doesn't list anything as being influenced by Disney's The Little Mermaid, but the name Barnaby says the image comes straight from TV's Barnaby Jones. Who??? I don't think this book would be helpful to new parents looking for a fun baby name book. Some names that you love might carry a less than pleasant \\"image,\\" and that might wrongfully sway what should be an objective and personal decision. Overall, the book is fascinating, but once you've looked through it for about 10 minutes, you've already looked up your name, your family's names, and the names of all your friends. Maybe you've had a laugh or two. Even so, you'll probably feel like you made a truly frivolous purchase. I'm sure you could find this same information on the internet somewhere and save yourself a little green.	2003-03-10

It's features a great assortment of both sweet and savory crepes. Some are a little too gourmet for my taste (I'm thinking of the Shrimp &amp; Jicama crepes, specifically), but most are simple, easy and delicious. The best part about this cookbook is it quickly shows you how quick and versatile crepes are. They can be used like pancakes, like tortillas, and sometimes even like pasta (like with Spinach and Ricotta crepes....just like manicotti). It's easy to throw ice cream, fruit, or nuts into a crepe for an amazing dessert. Sure, the book shows you plenty of amazing recipes, but taking the basic ideas and coming up with your own creation is a snap. This is a marvelous book. Sure to make a crepe enthusiast out of you!	2003-02-23

I have a photo of me reading it to my younger sister when I was 7 and she was 18 months old. I loved the book back then, and I love it equally now. The message of giving love freely and universally is beautiful. The illustrations are also lovely. I look forward to the time when my own son is old enough to enjoy the Warm Fuzzy Tale. I'm so glad that it's still in print! The story might be geared toward children, but even adults can find something meaningful and reassuring within its pages. Something that will make you feel, well...warm and fuzzy!	2003-02-18

She lives in a studio apartment with her sister. She's a temp at a law firm with the world's most annoying boss. Then it builds to include a hot new romance and a intra-office mystery at the law firm that begins with one of the head honchos being murdered at the company holiday party. This book really has a little of everything. There's lots of comedy, a murder mystery, a little romance, a little sex. Nothing is too over the top. I never felt like I was reading a romance novel or dry crime fiction. It reminded me a little of the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich (I'm thinking of Four to Score, in particular). Lots of fun and unexpected twists.<br />I gave the book four stars instead of five because of the ending. It left me with a few unanswered questions. I got the feeling that the author didn't quite know how to wrap up the book. I was a bit disappointed. But, overall, I thought the book was fantastic. I definitely plan to check out future books by Jill Winters.	2003-02-12

This book is not for women who want reliable information about pregnancy and birth choices. The author has poor and dangerous advice. Some of her claims are absolutely ludicrous. She actually says that C-sections are great, and that pregnancy is a time when you have an excuse not to exercise. She focuses a great deal on your pregnancy appearance. She's almost obsessive about how gaining weight and getting fat make you ugly. She even goes so far as to say she sympathizes with her husband for not finding her attractive when she's pregnant. (And this from a woman who was a pre-preganncy size 4, and the biggest she got was size 10!) This information is completely detrimental. Don't believe it. She's also completely dismissive of women who seek more natural childbirth, claiming they're &quot;frontier women with something to prove.&quot; Again, her claims are ridiculous, close-minded, and ignorant.<br />The book isn't a total waste. You just have to know that you're buying a book for HUMOR and not for information. Her discussion about the wild mood swings of pregnancy will have you laughing out loud. However, I have to say that for the laughs this book may give you, I doubt it's worth the money. Borrow a copy from a &quot;girlfriend&quot; instead. And while you're at it, read The Birth Book by Dr. Sears.	2003-02-12

Since we limit TV time at our house, I thought that getting him some books about the movie would be a happy compromise when he wants to watch, and I want to get him away from \\"the box.\\"  He was thrilled to read M is for Monster. The book is written from Mike's point of view. So it starts out with Mike at a drawing board saying, \\"A is for author. I write AND I'm cute.\\" It goes on to feature several characters from the movie: Boo, Celia, George, Sully. The story itself is written in rhyme. The illustrations are simple but colorful. It's a great book. My only complaint is that it only comes in paperback. It's rather flimsy. I would love to see this as a board book. But even as-is, I think it's definitely worth the money.	2003-02-12

I had no idea what the book was about. I was pleasantly surprised to find such a wonderful story of unconditional love, coupled with beautiful illustrations. The book starts with a mother tucking her son into bed and saying, \\"I love you my wonderful child.\\" The son then asks if she would still love him if he were a scary swamp monster, a meat eating dinosaur, or a smelly skunk. Always, the mother answers that she would love him no matter what and would always help and take care of him. But it's not written in a sappy way that will make mothers cry (unlike, say, \\"I Love You Forever\\"). It manages to convey a touching message without making you go into sugar shock. It's a positive, uplifting story that both parents and young children will enjoy. An excellent addition to your home library.	2003-01-22

Let me start this review by saying that the two stars are meant for the book as a whole, and not for The Bradley Method itself. I was pleased to find a book that encourages mothers to take control of their birthing experience by relaxing, rather than medicating away the pain. The exercises are helpful, even though they largely rely on illustrations to explain how the exercises are done. I wish they would have written out what to do with more detail. Even so, I definitely plan to use the Bradley Method when preparing for my next pregnancy.<br />Other than the actual method, this book is completely outdated. The most recent publication listed in the bibliography is 1987, which is light years away when you consider the advancement of medical technology. Most of the references were published in the mid-70's. So the statistics stated cannot possibly be current and correct. Even the photographs (which, by the way, almost always show the women nude) are obviously from the 70's. I think the thing that bothered me the most was the outdated pregnancy information. It's old news that pregnant women shouldn't restrict their diets, shouldn't take drugs, and shouldn't smoke. Doesn't everyone already know this? The section where it talks about selecting your doctor actually states that you can reduce your risk of toxemia by choosing a well informed physician. As if what the doctor knows is more influential on your body than your own health and health choices! How ridiculous.<br />The information about the actual birth and ways to relax is beneficial. I especially appreciated the section on how to avoid episiotomies. However, since the rest of the book is so completely outdated, the author and publishers should make a MAJOR revision before this book is worth the money.	2003-01-17

My son was very interested in balloons, so I bought him a couple books about them. Where do Balloons Go? quickly became our favorite. The illustrations are beautiful, vibrant watercolors. The story is funny, with a touching ending. I found myself with a bit of a lump in my throat reading the closing line (\\"Where do balloons go? It's a mystery, I know. So just hold on tight till you have to...let go.\\"). The sentiment is so meaningful. Some reviewers have commented that this book would be a good way to explain to a child how to deal with the death of a loved one. I can see it as applying to many other aspects in life where you have to \\"let go.\\" The main idea is to appreciate what you have in the present moment.<br />Of course, most of the \\"meaningful\\" stuff goes right over my toddler's head. He just likes that it's a silly story about balloons and where they might go when you let them go free. The story is written in rhyme, so you can't help but use a sing-song voice when you read it. My son eats that up. He also loves that the center pages fold out to reveal \\"a big balloon dance.\\" It's his favorite part. I was concerned that the special fold out pages would end up damaged or torn, but he's very careful with them. Well, as careful as a two year old can be. The book has held up just fine, though. The ages listed for this book are 4 through 8 years, but I think that even younger children can appreciate it, as well as parents. It's a fabulous book, and sure to be a favorite for any family.	2003-01-16

This book is excellent for parents who practice Attachment Parenting. It starts by explaining that when the child was a baby, their parents did everything for them. This shows a mother breastfeeding, parents and baby co-sleeping, and a father \\"wearing\\" the baby in a sling. It then talks about diapers and how as children get older, they use the potty like their parents. There are lots of parent tips that appear in the margins, encouraging further discussion and customizing things to suit your family's needs and preferences. As always, Dr. Sears encourages you to follow your instincts.<br />The story itself isn't much different from the one you'd find in The Potty Book or other training books. It follows a child through potty training, buying underwear, etc. The narrative uses language a child can understand, but sometimes it seemed a bit too babyish for me. (\\"poo-poo goes bye-bye\\"). I don't think you have to talk down to kids to get them to understand. But, that small complaint aside, the book is informative and positive. It's a wonderful teaching tool, and perfectly suited for Attachment families.	2003-01-15

Matthew says that balloons go to Balloonia, a land far away, above the clouds, populated entirely by balloons. Jessica wants to see Balloonia, so she screams at her balloon to take her there. Then she magically turns into a balloon herself, and off they go. Balloonia is a place where everything is made of balloons: the buildings, the trees, roller coasters, people. After having lots of fun in Balloonia, she realizes that she is going to meet the same fate as many balloons (she's losing her air), and she starts to shrink. She goes flying back to her house, where she becomes her real self again.<br />I bought this book because my 2 year old son has been fascinated with balloons. I thought a story about balloons and their \\"home\\" would be great. I was a little disappointed when I finally received this book. The illustrations, for the most part, are painful. There are several \\"panes\\" of illustration on each page. It makes the pages look cramped. The pictures of Balloonia are beautiful and colorful, but those only take up a couple pages. The rest are awful. Jessica, the little girl in the story, is pushy and demanding. It just wasn't the happy little story I was expecting at all.<br />If you're looking for a fun story featuring balloons, I highly recommend \\"Where Do Balloons Go, An Uplifting Mystery\\" by Jamie Lee Curtis instead. The illustrations are beautiful, and the story is much, MUCH more entertaining.	2002-11-20

My son was showing some of the signs that he might be ready for his own potty, so I bought this book to introduce the basics. I was really impressed. It explains how babies wear diapers, but when they grow up, they use a potty. It also illustrates important points like not using too much toilet paper and washing your hands afterwards. It's a simple story, so it doesn't go into a lot of detail. There's no discussion of \\"poo-poo\\" or \\"pee-pee.\\" It just uses the generic term \\"having to go.\\" But I don't think that's a bad thing. This book isn't meant to be the only training tool you use. I think it's a great introduction to potty training. And my son can't get enough of it. He wants to read it over and over. You'll have it memorized within a week.	2002-09-19

After reading the first couple chapters of this book, I started getting the feeling that the book really was completely bleak and depressing with no happiness whatsoever. Life just kept getting worse and worse for the three Baudelaire siblings. Bad enough their house burned down, killing their parents. Then they have to endure itchy clothing, cold oatmeal, and an evil greedy villian after their money. I started to think that perhaps I should heed Lemony Snicket's warnings, and put down the book in favor of something light and happy. However, the closer I got to the end, the more the story grew on me. Even though horrible things happen to the Baudelaires, there are some bright spots. I found myself anxious to read more, just to see if maybe they triumph over their misfortune. It's not entirely fun, but it's fascinating. And I think it has a great underlying message about the strength of family. Well, that's not entirely true since the evil Count Olaf was part of their family. But the siblings rely on each other and love each other very much, and that made me feel all warm and fuzzy.	2002-07-21

And I was very anxious to run out and buy Hard Eight right when it came out. I even had its release date marked on my calendar. The reviews said that it was a little darker than the other books, and that this book helped Janet Evanovich avoid falling into a rut with her plotlines. But I don't really see much of a difference between this and all the other Stephanie Plum novels. She still has people breaking into her apartment. She still has her cars blown up. Her Grandma is still as crazy as ever. She's still kind of inept at the bounty hunter thing. She still doesn't like carrying her gun. It's just more of the same Stephanie Plum that's been in all the previous books. Except that she finally \\"repays her debt\\" to Ranger in this novel instead of just talking about it. But the whole encounter was anticlimatic (no pun intended!), and didn't seem worth all the build up. For those die hard Stephanie Plum fans out there, this book doesn't disappoint. But if you're looking for something new and fresh, it doesn't really deliver.	2002-07-01

I was very pleasantly surprised to come across this book. It shows both the young boy and his grandmother in traditional Ukrainian dress. They even call the grandmother Baba (the Ukrainian word for grandmother). But even beyond the Ukrainian stuff, this book is excellent. The illustrations are beautiful. There are small inset illustrations that tell more background of the story along with the larger, main pictures. So this book is both a picture book and a story book in one. My son loves to look at the animals and all but shrieks with laughter whenever we act out the big sneeze that shoots them all out of the mitten. I'm sure this book will be a treasure in our home for years to come!	2002-06-14

I had been searching for a book that featured several different flower types and their names, as well as color illustrations. I was so pleased when I found Alison's Zinnia! Not only are there beautiful color paintings of the different blooms, there is also a narrative that teaches the ABC's. A few of the flower types are difficult to pronounce (even for the adults out there!), and how many girls do we really know named Xantippa? Also, I was a little disappointed that all the names featured in the book were little girls. I would have liked to see some boys thrown in the mix. Especially since I bought his book for my son. But I still think that the book is a priceless addition to our family library.	2002-04-24

There was never any doubt in my mind that I would be a dedicated breastfeeding mom from the very beginning. When it was time for me to return to work, I dreaded the separation from my baby. I was concerned that my son wouldn't take to the bottle, that I wouldn't express enough during the day, that he'd start to prefer formula...my list of worries went on. I had actually been pumping at work for nearly a month when I bought this book. I thought it would give me some additional tips on making the most of the experience. I really fell in love with it! Every time I'd pick it up, I'd feel like the authors were giving me a big pat on the back for being so committed to giving my son the best. It stressed that even though you're back at work, and regardless of the reasons you returned (whether you had to work for financial reasons, were dedicated to your career, etc.), by continuing to nurse you have a firm and lasting connection with your baby. And I found that as time went on, and I had times when I wasn't as enthusiastic about pumping, if I read a bit of this book, it brought back those good feelings and reaffirmed that I was doing the right thing. It's excellent for motivation and confidence in working mothers.	2002-02-25

The Baby Book has saved me on more than one occasion. So when my sweet little boy got to the stage where I felt like I was saying NO every 5 seconds, I thought The Discipline Book would be an ideal resource. In many ways, it is the resource I hoped it would be. Dr Sears covers different types of discipline styles and seems relatively objective in reviewing what's good and bad about each. It was nice to see the pros and cons, which reinforced the idea that you need to pick and choose what works best for you and your child. I really like books that stress trusting your intuition. The thing that I found a little unrealistic is how Dr Sears seems to think that as long as you're close to your child and follow the Attachment Parenting philosophy, your child will be a perfect angel who will obey because they want to please you. I think this truly underestimates the role of personality and disposition. Even children who are securely Attached are still going to have stubborn and independent streaks. Or worse. And while I love Dr Sears and think this book is a good starting point, I don't think this is as complete a guide to Discipline as it could be.	2002-02-25

From the brief description I read about it, I thought it sounded like some fun, light reading. I figured I'd zip though it. But I just couldn't get interested. How can they expect me to care about the main character when he's an obnoxious 12 year old millionaire? He's nasty to nearly everyone he meets. And he's also supposed to be a child genius, so he talks to everyone like they're stupid. It's far from enchanting, to say the least. The story follows Artemis as he attempts to take over the fairy world or something like that. To be honest, I could barely get through half of this book. Artemis is repellent. The real story in this book, though, isn't really about Artemis, it's about Holly, the fairy that he kidnaps. She's the real hero: smart, funny, and interesting. She almost makes reading about Artemis bearable!	2002-01-17

I had truly enjoyed both 8 Weeks to Optimum Health and Natural Health, Natural Medicine. This is yet another excellent resource on how to integrate &quot;alternative&quot; medical practices with what you already know in order to achieve natural healing and wellness. Much of what he says are things that we already know: exercise is good, we need to eat more vegetables and fiber, get enough rest, and so on. But he also has new ideas presented here, as well as in his other books. I'm especially impressed with the breathing techniques. I was very skeptical that something as simple as breathing could have an impact on how I was feeling. But it really does make a difference! (The &quot;waking up&quot; technique saved me in college when I had no coffee).<br />My only criticism for this book is that the philosophy is &quot;believe you'll be well, visualize being well, and it will happen.&quot; I agree that the mind plays a large role in our health, but I don't think that mind power alone will save you from all ailments. One example in the book is actually a woman who beat cancer without going through traditional treatments or chemotherapy. I find that wonderful and inspiring, but a bit unrealistic.<br />This book focuses on Healing in particular, so I would definitely take that into account when making a purchase. It talks about overcoming various health problems and has several good tips about health in general. But unless you're specifically looking for such a resource, I would recommed getting a book that covers health in a more general way such as Natural Health, Natural Medicine. If you're a pretty healthy person, this book really isn't really necessary.	2002-01-17

Both of these books give you a wealth of information about what to expect both before and after your baby is born. The problem I have with them is that they are set up in a Q&amp;A format. Some unnamed parent writes in with a question about their baby and the authors answer. Though this does cover many important topics, I was hoping for something more direct. For example, when I was wondering what the signs of teething were, I had to consult the index, which directed me to several sections that mentioned teething, but didn't spell out the information I was looking for. I found this to be a problem mostly in What to Expect the First Year. I didn't really have any complaints about What to Expect When You're Expecting. It's definitely one of, if not THE, best book out there about pregnancy. Buy it. Just don't get this boxed set. For information on you baby's first year, I'd recommend a different parenting book such as The Baby Book by Dr. Sears.	2001-08-30

I bought this book because, although I'm not completely fluent in Spanish (yet!), I wanted to expose my son to different languages. I love Where the Wild Things Are, so this seemed an obvious choice for us. The story is wonderful and imaginative. The illustrations are some of the best in children's literature. Some of the pages in the book have no narration. Only pictures. So it appeals to younger book enthusiasts who aren't quite old enough to read. One of the best additions to your home library you'll ever find!	2001-08-06

This &quot;fable&quot; is definitely not the same. No high adventure here. But the book certainly has its merits. Goldman/Morgenstern is able to create characters with whom you instantly connect. You can't help but adore them--even in the case of John the Bastard, the overly-critical professor of hopeful gondoliers. The ending, overly sentimental for my taste, was a bit disappointing. Overall, the book was not an unpleasant read. When it was out of print, I would have said it wasn't worth the trouble of hunting down a copy. But since it's been re-released, I think it would be a shame not to check it out. It's a nice addition to any collection.	2001-08-06

I both loved and hated elements of this book. I liked that the author encouraged parents to become more in tune with their baby, learning their cues and signals. I also liked that she defined different baby &quot;personalities&quot; and what tendencies each one exhibited. (My son fell into the &quot;textbook baby&quot; category.) But what I was open to at first, and then grew to hate, was her insistence on putting your baby on a schedule. A rather rigid one. And that babies should sleep in their own bed, in their own room, and never with their parents. That seemed fine to me at first, when I was still pregnant. But then I actually had my baby, and tried these methods. Frankly, I was miserable. I became more and more frustrated and confused, not to mention exhausted. Finally, after two months of trying &quot;the baby whisperer way&quot; I ditched the book, and decided to follow what my intutition told me. My son slept in our bedroom with us for a while, and we let him find his own schedule instead of trying to invent one for him. We've been a wonderfully happy (and RESTED) family ever since.<br />This book has it merits, don't get me wrong. As a first time mom, I guess I assumed all the answers would be found in ONE book. But what I've learned is that with this, as with all parenting books, you have to pick and choose what works for you and your baby. Attachment parenting was what we needed in our household. But if you dislike that philosophy, or if it hasn't worked for you, then I think this book is worth a try.	2001-08-01
US	51343351	RRV00TSROQ1NN	0553801007	547804778	The Tae-Bo Way	Books	5	8	8	N	Y	Everything explained	When I bought my Tae-Bo videos, I loved the workout but I knew I had some troubles with my form. I had trouble keeping by balance and one of the kicks would lead to a sore hip. I knew I must be doing something wrong. When I bought this book, I had expected the book to be about Tae Bo success stories. I didn't really know that it went through each of the moves step by step, explaining how to position your body and how to tighten your muscles. I was so glad that the book explained things. I definitely feel like I get so much more out of Tae Bo now that I'm sure I do it correctly.	2001-07-25

I bought this book when I was preparing for my pregnancy. It had excellent tips on healthy eating, not only from a pregnancy perspective, but from nutrition in general. It covers the preconception stage, gearing up for pregnancy, then pregnancy itself, and lastly has a section on what to eat postpartum. One thing I loved about the book is that it explains how eating right will bring you back to your pre-pregnancy shape much faster. I gained 35 pounds with my pregnancy and lost it all within the first 3 months, and I've continued to lose. This book is an excellent resource for nutrition in general, even beyond the pregnancy part.	2001-07-25

I bought this book because I was thinking of starting my family in the near future, and wanted to know the ins and outs of fertility. I also was curious about its claim of &quot;natural&quot; birth control. I was amazed with the wealth of information this book has to offer. Not only about avoiding or achieving pregnancy, but also about the female body in general. I think this is an absolutely invaluable resource for all women. There are things in this book that even most doctors won't tell you. And it makes you realize how truly amazing the female body is.	2001-07-25

It's been an excellent resource for me. It covers everything from the first day you bring baby home, to teething and feeding, etc. The only thing to be aware of is that Dr. Sears has a lot of strong views on parenting that might not appeal to everyone. Things like having your baby sleep in bed with you aren't always accepted with open arms in today's society. But I have to say that his methods really worked for me and my son.	2001-07-24
