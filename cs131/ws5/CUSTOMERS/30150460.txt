Buy this book on tape; it is only 90 minutes long, perfect for your commute to work.  The questions for personal reflection after each section will be missing but if you like the audio then spend a few extra bucks and pick up the paperback for the questions if you think you are missing out.  This Maxwell book talks about finishing a marathon in a stadium with a crowd cheering you on.  I have actually seen something like this at the Atlanta Olympics back in 1996 when the final runner was more than a lap behind and the race was all but over.  The crowd cheered the loudest not for the winners but for this last lone runner.  At each turn the crowd acknowledged the talent that got him there even if in comparison it wasn't enough to get him the gold.  I don't think there was a dry eye in the stadium.  Maxwell takes this type of encouragement a step further and brings 10 Biblical Giants down from the crowd one by one to help the racer (you).  They are: Noah, Esther, an unnamed servant girl, Joseph, Moses, Rebekah, Abraham, Nehemiah, Jonathan, and David.  Each has a powerful lesson to share with you.  Don't pass this opportunity up.  If you have ever thought to yourself it would be nice to have a mentor to help me along the way - Then this book is for you!  After completing this book you will come to realize that the real power of this book is not in its length it is in the way it will make you think and feel about your life and its purpose.      Become \\"an apple seed planter\\" like John talks about.	2005-06-11

This book is a good tool to do just that, get back on course, gain perspective on what failure really is and figure out what to do next.    This is the sixth book by John Maxwell I have read and it is his BEST!!   My local library had it on tape, so I picked it up - however I finished it the first time and didn't want to return it, so instead of paying late fees I went out and bought a copy of my own.  I think Failing Forward is a MUST have, add it to your collection.  I would suggest the audio version because it is so motivational in nature.  You will never get tired of listening to it.    I really liked John's concept of 'FORWARD.'  It is as follows:    f = Finalize your goal   The goal shapes the plan, the plan shapes the action, the action achieves the results, the results bring the success    o = Order your plans    r = Risk failing by taking action   planning alone will not bring success   nothing of value is ever achieved without risk    w = Welcome mistakes    a =  Advanced based on character    r =  Re-evaluate your progress continuously    d = Develop new strategies to succeed    I would like to also mention that the final four chapters are the most important.

That is the message I got from this book.  My company/department made it mandatory that we all read it. I was the first to finish it and after eight years with the same company I left.  The book is simple, and straight forward.  If you have ever gone through a company shake-up then this book is for you.  I suggest you buy the audio version and listen to it for full impact.  Because the message is short and to the point maybe buy it used to save a little cash.  It is only 1 hour long - perfect for a trip to and from the office in one day.

I gave it a star for each time I listened to it. (three times)  Pros:  I liked the concept of \\"planned neglect\\" of one thing when working on a different \\"more important\\" growth area.  I also liked the example of the eagle and obstacles:  Obstacles for an eagle to overcome and fly with greater ease and speed is the air. Yet if the air were withdrawn and the eagle were made to attempt to fly in a vacuum, it wouldn't be possible.  The very element that offers resistance to flying (air) is at the same time a condition that makes the flight a possibility.  A necessary evil.  Cons:  I see lots of overlap in the overall message Maxwell delivers and Zig Ziglar's body of work (which he does give due credit).  The end of the book and the topic on dealing with people unfortunately isn't done as well as Dale Carnegie's \\"How to Win Friends and Influence Others\\"  The other thing I couldn't get my mind around was the many lists presented throughout.  There are just too many to remember and not enough storytelling to cement the points already made.    Rating:  Good Enough to listen to, but maybe borrow it or get it used.	2005-05-06

Many of the self help books today are like fast food.  Made for easy consumption. <br />I guess that is why The Law of Success was such a pleasant surprise.  It has some real meat to it. So much so that it has taken me three weeks to digest just the first two volumes of material on the 17 Laws that are presented in the first two installments. <br />This volume covers the first four lessons of the 17 principles that make up The Law of Success. <br /> <br />Self-Mastery is engaging enough to make me continue on to volume II as well as order volumes 3 & 4.  Hard to believe it was written so long ago but yet is STILL so relevant to today's business environment. <br /> <br />The 4 questions on Definiteness of Purpose were the best part.

John Maxwell talks about how the earlier you settle the critical issues in your life the greater the potential for your success.  Thus by avoiding procrastination on these key choices, you will no longer feel the guilty feelings associated with them.    The concept that the \\"pain\\" of discipline is   \\"momentary\\" but the benefit of it is long lasting (lasting the ENTIRE day - 16 hours of the day)was a revelation for me.    The funniest part was the morning prayer he included:  \\"Dear Lord - So far today I am doing alright,  I have not gossiped, lost my temper, been greedy, grumpy, nasty, selfish or self indulgent.  I have not whined, cursed or eaten any chocolate - however,  I am going to get out of bed in a few minutes and I will need a lot more help after that.\\"    I highly recommend this CD.

I wanted more supporting details (3.5 to 4 Stars)	Yes Mr Gerstner called all the shots in the 90's and yes he, the company, and the stockholders made a lot of money doing it - and no IBM doesn't need another cheerleader but I must say this book does do a good job of describing what it took to turn around IBM.  As a side benefit it also helps bring some logic to the reason \\"why\\" the computer arena runs the way it does.  In addition it also gives a \\"business persons'\\" look at the other major players in the market not just an insider techie perspective.      The target market for this book is for experienced business leaders, young IT managers, AND the everyday computer client.  I would categorize myself as an everyday client.  As a client and growing up with Apple as a market leader in the 80's and Microsoft in the 80 & 90's.  I would have to say Lou Gerstner's \\"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance\\" book was the missing piece to the computer puzzle for me.  It balances out what I previously read in Bill Gates' books \\"The Road Ahead\\" and \\"Business at the Speed Thought.\\" The Microsoft desktop with it's web and email access was the standard as far as I was concerned.  I simply was not aware of the IBM history that occurred prior to 1990.  Looking back, when I was in school we had personal computers on our desktop and in college we had internet access, and when I starting working, email was the norm. So you can imagine my surprise when I picked up this book and discovered that these three technology's were not the norm prior to 1990.  I had no idea that much of IBM's work from the 50's & 60's made a lot of today's e-lifestyle possible. Being in the computer industry for the last 12 years and seeing the web reach critical mass and its' subsequent explosion shed little light on what preceded it.      POSITIVES:  Here are a couple of the ideas I liked from the book:    Gerstner's/IBM High Performance Principles:  Drivers for success:  1 The marketplace is the driving force  behind what a company should be involved in    2 What isat the core of a company: In IBM's case, it is a technology and nothing else  3 Look outside to measure success via customer satisfaction and increased shareholder value   4 Operate as an entrepreneurial organization with minimum of bureaucracy and never ending focus on productivity  5 Have a sense of urgency   (Planning & analysis is secondary to action)   6 Never lose sight of strategic vision, direction & mission Reward teamwork   8 Be sensitive to ALL employees needs    NEGATIVES:  When comparing this book to that of GM's Jack:  \\"Straight From The Gut\\" where you almost need a score card to keep track of all the players - It seems to me, that the entire story of IBM and its' turn around was not told, for what ever reason some information was omitted.  I can only recall Mr Gerstner pointing out at the most 4 people.    I think it is fair to say Mr Gerstner does minimize the impact that the phone companies, like MCI, had on rolling out a individual customer based internet product in the early 90's.    Furthermore, one of the other things that Mr Gerstner  failed to address was the on-going concerns between access types in the public vs private domain:  business vs personal use of access, cost sharing and privacy issues when at work.  Issues like, on-line shopping, stock trading, personal email, etc are vague and unsupported.  Maybe this is because he is not a so-called \\"techie.\\"    Whether you buy this book or not I think it is safe to say what happens in your cube on your desktop right now was made possible in large part by the people in this book, ALL the IBM folks (past and present) as well as their competitors.      In summary I can say that I looked at this title a year ago and now in retrospect after finishing it, I wish I hadn't waited so long to read it.  I picked up the CD version at the library	2005-03-25

You may not use ALL of the ideas in this book BUT if you find just one that helps you - then it is worth the investment. I believe each one of John Maxwell's types of thinking that are identified and briefly explained could be individual books all by themselves.  The thing I appreciated most about  \\"Thinking For a Change\\" was that it gave me \\"just enough\\" of what I was looking for.  My suggestion is to read \\"Thinking.. \\" then pick the area you most need work on and delve deeper with other resources.  Reading this book, gave me one key concept on strategic thinking which I was able to immediately apply to a business issue I was trying to figure out for the last 18 months. It made the difference in how I saw the problem and gave me a tool to successfully analyze it and ultimately move through it.

I listened to it on CD.  As a regular audio book listener, I found the content to be good but the delivery just OK.

The author did a nice job of weaving together two 'good' but separate stories into one GREAT single story.  The transitions are seamless.  The TCS Heaven & Earth a Journey travel tour would be an exciting subject just by itself, however more importantly in this case it serves to set the stage for the two Sparks brothers to reminisce and reconcile their childhood lives and come to a deep appreciation of what it was like to grow up together.  The sometimes offensive and juvenile conduct on the trip lightens the sadness of the main story which is being told at the same time.   I personally think that this \\"ugly American\\" behavior serves to balance or reduce the sad/negative impact of the Sparks childhood tragedies on the reader.  On the upside, throughout the book you can hear their parents repeating some GREAT parenting words of wisdom.  For instance:  \\"What you want and what you get are often two entirely different things.\\" and  \\"Nobody ever said life was fair, it's your life - do with it whatever you like.\\"  My parents said many of the very same things for example when I was a kid and was confronted with an unusually large task.  They would say:  \\"See how fast you can get it done.\\" or \\"If you are in it - get in it, otherwise get out.\\"  They said them so often that the words rolled off their lips as if they were gospel.  I believe that is why these types of pearls of wisdom are still with me today and more importantly I use them on my own kids.  Speaking of kids, with both of their parents working to support the family, the Sparks children were given a long leash.  As you might imagine with so much freedom growing up they managed to get themselves into mischief without much difficulty.  Over the course of their world tour, it is THESE stories that the brothers tell that make the book so enjoyable.  A couple of other funny things that stuck with me were the stories about family \\"default\\" Christmas gifts, like a \\"family\\" stereo and don't forget the personal headphones to match or better yet every kids dream -  a carpenters hammer!!  As a kid if you have ever received something like a file cabinet as a Christmas gift you will be able to relate.    The part about the \\"feast or famine\\" mentality when it came to sweets in the house was hilarious!  These episodes included such things as eating an entire box of sweet cereal or an entire bag of their dad's \\"hidden\\" Oreos in a single sitting!!  My brothers & I did the same thing!      The final couple of chapters are filled with both joy and pain.   It makes for an interesting AND emotional read. - I liked it enough to read it twice!      I must say, if you are looking for specific travel information on Tikal, Guatemala * Lima, Cusco & Machu Picchu, Peru, Easter Island * Samoa * Ayers Rock, Australia, Angkor, Cambodia * Jaipur & Taj Mahal, India, Lalibela, Ethiopia * and Valletta & M'dina, Malta then this is the not the book for you.       I say buy this book if, like the Sparks brothers,  you wish to enjoy a short trip back to the fond memories of your childhood. I did.	2005-02-03

This gives you another view of Mitch Album that you would not otherwise ever see or hear about.  In my opinion it was weighted more heavily on the first person experience of the author than that of his former teacher. It has some useful advice throughout and makes for a good read (but not great).

Read it -  but maybe buy it used<br /><br />This book does however ask some good questions about how to go from being good to GREAT such as:<br /><br />1.  What am I(or what is the company) intrinsically passionate about?<br />2.  What is the company\am I good at?  and does this \\"thing\\" come naturally?<br />3.  Finally does this area that was chosen have \\"GREAT\\" potential?<br /><br />On the other hand, here are some questions that I felt were left unanswered:<br /><br />Can't you be GREAT at two things at the same time?<br /><br />According to Jack Welch's book, you should strive to be #1 OR #2.<br />btw: Aren't there three medals awarded in the Olympics?<br /><br />What about sales?  The Mary Kay Company motto is \\"Nothing happens until somebody sells something.\\" (from her book)<br /><br />What about creating barriers to entry for competitors? (to protect market share like Carnegie or Rockefeller did)<br /><br />Why didn't you include MORE on the failures of the Good to Great companies?  Not just the failures of the competition.  Guys like Edison, Lincoln had many defeats before they found ultimate success.<br />Doesn't bouncing back from failures have something to do with going from Good to Great?<br /><br />The author mentions getting the right people in the right seats on the bus and the wrong people off.  I believe this is an oversimplification.  Age, salary, tenure, unions, hierarchy etc make this a very difficult task to accomplish!!<br /><br />Yes this book took 5 years to write and was supported by 21 staff researchers BUT I am not totally convinced of the results.  (and I liked the first book -  Built to Last)<br />That's why I gave it only 3 stars	2004-07-14

The bonus author interview at the end was the best part.  It included a pitch for one of his other books &quot;Good to Great&quot;.  Jim Collins also has a web site, of the same name, that has an additional 10 non business books that he recommends.  These additional resources have provided two of the next books I plan on reading.<BR>As far as Built to Last goes, the following are some of his key concepts from this book. <BR>1.  Be a &quot;Clock builder&quot; instead of a &quot;teller of time&quot;<BR>2.  BHAGS (def in the book)<BR>3.  The &quot;and&quot; instead of the &quot;or&quot;<BR>4.  Preserve the core<BR>5.  Cult like corporate cultures<BR>6.  Stimulating progress<BR>7.  Alignment <BR>8.  All leaders die<BR>Two other tid bits that caught my attention:  The fact about how at the 18 visionary companies only 4 CEO's have ever been selected to the top spot in these organizations from outside the company.  And finally the 3M example of how to effectively facilitate interaction between internal departments, by inventing a Technology Sharing Award and Technical Honor Society.<BR>If you are a business type climbing the corporate ladder, it is worth a read. 3.5 to 4 stars	2004-05-10

What about AOL?, and what about the fact that  he didn't even once mention Netscape, the superior company who revolutionized the Internet with their browser.    Don't get me wrong it is a very good book.  However somewhat lopsided  I guess I must be on a different road than the one Mr Gates is traveling on.  btw: I happen to be one of the many  Microsoft Certified Professionals that invested a significant amount of my own money and time supporting his products.   (10 grand and 12 years)     I think this book is as much about what is NOT in the book as opposed to what IS in the book!!  Buy it anyway!  (Maybe used - it is some what dated) You will learn something just by being exposed to it.  The concept of  The Web as being  \\"self publishing\\" was an eye opener for me.    My favorite chapter and quote was from Chapter 8 Friction-Free Capitalism.   \\"Our success in the PC world has come from working in partnership with such great companies as Intel, Compaq, HP, DEC, NEC, and dozens of others.  Even IBM and Apple, with whom we have occasionally been in competition, have had an immense amount of our cooperation and support.  We created a company that was dependent on partners.  We bet that somebody other than us would do great chips, somebody other than us would build great PCs, somebody other than us would do great distribution and integration.  We took a narrow slice and focused on that.  In this new world, we want to work with companies from every industry to help them make the most of the opportunities the information revolution will bring.\\" page 182    Well here are some other technology people and companies you might want to investigate as I am sure they too will have an impact on the direction of the road we will all be traveling:  (unless of course, he buys them or squeezes them out)  Doug Humphrey - Founder, Digex ; Chairman and Founder, Cidera  Jonathan Klein - Co-founder and CEO, Getty Images  Tom Stockham - President of Access and Emerging Markets, Ticketmaster    Chip Perry - President and CEO - AutoTrader.com, former VP, Los Angeles Times  Jim McCann - Founder, Chairman and CEO - 1-800-FLOWERS  Brooks Fisher - Vice President (Strategic Initiatives), Intuit; former VP, Infoseek   Micheal Rubin - Founder, Chairman and CEO - Global Sports  Robert Covington - Chief Technology Officer and EVP, MerchantWired  Rob Burgess - Chairman and CEO - Macromedia; former SVP, Silicon Graphics  Steven Snyder - founder and chairman - Net Perceptions  Kenneth Cron - CEO, Flipside, Inc; former President of Publishing, CMP Media  Emerick Woods - President and CEO - Vicinity  Glenn Meakem - Founder, Chairman and CEO - FreeMarkets  Ted Meisel - President and CEO - GoTo.com  Nicholas vanDyk- President, Artisan New Media; EVP, Artisan Entertainment  Glenn Meyers- Founder and CEO - Rare Medium Group   Mark Goldstein - President and CEO - K-Mart's BlueLight  Charles Johnson - Founder and CEO - PurchasePro  David Perry- Founder, Chairman and CEO - Ventro  Alan Meckler- Founder, Chairman and CEO - INTMedia Group   Christopher Jenkins - former President, Ziplink; former VP, Arch Communications  Michael Levy -Founder and CEO - CBS Sportsline  John Schwarz - CEO - Reciprocal; former General Manager, IBM Solutions  Chris MacAskill - Founder -FatBrain.com, CEO - MightyWords  Harry Motro - Chairman, MotroVentures, former CEO - Infoseek   Zach Nelson - CEO and President, Mcafee ASaP  Joe Chung - Founder and Chairman, Art Technology Group   Jeet Singh - Founder and CEO, Art Technology GroupRoyal Farros - Chairman, CEO and Founder, iPrint Inc.

The book was interesting enough to keep me listening all the way until the end.  I listened to the 6 CD version of the book on the way to work.<br />Without being associated with Mary Kay, I had a hard time relating to the experience the author was trying to convey.<br />If I had some first hand experience with the product or the sales staff, my opinion of the book might be different.<br />It sounds like a fine company.  Based on the individual stories in the book and the company sales statistics, the company merits high praise.  It seems as if they offer a  wonderful culture and opportunity to anyone who might be interested in selling.  I must say after reading Jack Straight from the Gut first, I can not think of a greater contrast in management style than that of Mary Kay and Jack Welch at GE.  Two successful companies - Two completely different management/leadership styles.  It sounds like Mary Kay applied the Dale Carnegie method to her company and people.<br />The Nine Keys:<br />Create and Maintain a Common Bond<br />Create the Future:  Think and Act Strategically<br />Make Me Feel Important<br />Motivate Others with Recognition and Celebration<br />Never Leave Your Values<br />Innovate or Evaporate<br />Foster Balance:  God, Family, Career<br />Have a Higher Purpose<br />OK Never Does It:  You've gotta been Great!<br />4/1/04	2004-04-01

It is difficult to argue GE's success over the past 20 years. Mr. Welch took a 12 billion company and made it into a 500 billion dollar business. Without even using a computer!! Regarding the portion of the book where he talks about assigning E-trainers for all the top executives in the company, all I have to say is rank does have its privileges, It must be nice to have a techie hold your hand if you are an executive and computer illiterate.   It is hard to believe that it wasn't until 1999 that Jack Welch sent his first email. A multimillionaire who isn't connected....   I am not sure if it is ignorance or apathy?    In regard to the layout of the book & in Mr Welch's defense, I am not sure how the author could have gotten around referencing everybody he worked with or for.  If you can get through that part of the book, there are some things in the rest of the book that are of value. I listened to the book on tape so it wasn't so bad.   He does talk about real people and real problems that he encountered throughout his career and what it took to get the job done working within the environment HE created.  If you are not a business person or just wondered what it is like at the top, here are a few of the key ideas Mr Welch talks about in his book.    Stretch jobs - Jobs that MAKE you grow   The runway of a person, - How long before takeoff  The vitality curve of a career  Differentiation being a key value to getting ahead	2004-04-01

After reading this book I am led to believe making money is more emotionally challenging than intellectually difficult.  Mr. Kiyosaki is part cheerleader, part salesman/coach.  The following are the three things you will get out of this book: the importance of  being able to read an Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and understand the importance of Cash Flow.  However, my 16 years of schooling, 12 years of work as well as the 20 different jobs I have taken since the age of 12 has taught me that there is more to making money then Mr Kiyosaki leads you to believe.  It is a nice story and easy to read.  I am glad HE is successful, however I am left with many questions.  It seemed to me to be incomplete.

If you are short on time and have other books and authors you would still like to get to, then skip it if you read the first book.  The thing I noticed immediately was the influence of the audiotape authors he alludes to throughout the book that he listened to during his previous sales days early in his career.  This is not a bad thing, just that the ideas are not necessary brand-new.  I would say he tells his story over and over again much like you're absent minded grandfather might.   It is a good story, just that you have already heard it once or twice. This book covers much more of the psychology of the money mind set than the nuts and bolts of the everyday how to - unless of course you buy his game Cashflow for kids.  (Which I did - on ... )  The four or five books the author suggests late in the book are all highly rated according to many other reviews on Amazon.
