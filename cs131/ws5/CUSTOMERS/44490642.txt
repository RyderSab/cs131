Those of you who have never been to Milwaukee, or -God forbid- only know what makes the news (kids beating a man to death on a porch, how much the Brewers suck, or Jeffrey Dahmer) ought to invest some time in this midwestern jewel.  This is a nice book that helps explain the vibrant background of this metro area of 1.7 million.  Famous folks weave through the narrative and we learn about the making of such places as the world famous Milwaukee County Zoo, Milwaukee Art Museum, Miller Brewing, the world reknowned Milwaukee County Museum of Natural History, the Schlitz Audubon Center, and the Mitchell Park Horticultural Domes.  John Gurda, resident historian, provides an in-depth view of these places and many other items that have shaped Milwaukee; the settling of the area, bridge wars, the growth of the city and suburbs, annexation battles, public services, neighborhood developent and decline, civil rights, urban blight, changes in industry and service trades, freeway construction etc. etc.  The book is also peppered throughout with wonderful archival photographs.  A must for any student of urban studies or public administration.  <br />Recommended.	2002-11-14

NO COMPROMISE is just that; a powerful, straight forward telling of the life of child musical prodigy come 70's-era preacher Keith Green.  For as long as I can remember I have heard his music.  I was practically raised on it.  Yet it took me until 2002 to actually read this book.  The experience was well worth it; his wife Melody did a good job considering lyric composition seems to be her forte.<br />The book is not too short and not so long as to scare away the somewhat-interested.  As I think back on the book, it really is quite an amazing summation of Keith's short 28 years.  Melody has included many small stories throughout the prose; stories of personal revalations, hilarious experiences, and tragic occurances.  We see the human side of this man who was so often held up as God-like figure in Christian music.  How fascinating it was for me-a fan of Keith's music for two decades-to read all these little anecdotes, diary clippings, journal entries, and especially information behind the writing of so many powerful songs.  The scope of the book is impressive just because of the number of people drawn into Keith and Melody's circle.  Many, many well known people are referred to and quoted.  I had no idea there was a Bob Dylan connection and friendship for example.  <br />NO COMPROMISE is a powerful book that follows Keith from his infant Christianity thru his maturing process and eventually, his untimely death.  The end of the book is difficult if only because it seems so sudden, but that's how it really was.  This is the story of how God worked in the lives of two young people and changed millions for the better.  Thankfully, the story did not end on that July day in Texas, it went on, and continues today.<br />Recommended.	2002-11-06

Lewis' \\"The Great Divorce\\" is a book that I have owned for years but only recently read.  I don't know why it took me so long, but now that I have read it I want to read it again all the more.  I guess that is a sign of a good book.  Many of you reading this review are no doubt familiar with Lewis the philosopher, theologian, writer, and speaker.  Suffice to say he remains one of the most esteemed and brilliant thinkers and writers of the last century.  <br />This book easily compares to the best of his work.  The idea of using a fantasy-land constructed around a bus trip to try to give us some look into the unknown is pure Lewis.  A dark, desolate, rainy bus stop gives us a mental picture of hell that reminds me of the films \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"Dark City\\".  The descriptions of a heaven-like place given in the book remind me of the house of Elrond and the elvish city in the recent \\"Lord of the Rings\\".  The book essentially follows the author as he tours both of these worlds-seemingly seperated by a million miles.  With George MacDonald as his guide, the author witnesses many interactions between those in the 'heavenly' world and those arriving from hell on a bus.  The heavenly beings-who are solid-attempt to convince the spirits aboard the tour to remain with them and allow themselves to be made whole by the overseer of the heavenly realm.  <br />Unfortunately, most of the spirits prefer to deal with their various troubles 'some other time' or not at all.  Wishing to remain as they are, they refuse the help of the heavenly beings.  We witness spirits literally and figuratively in chains of pity, anger, pride, arrogance, and fear.  The answer to all of these maladies is offered to them with outstretched arms, they need only accept the gift.  <br />The most powerful exchange in the book comes between a spirit who arrives with a little red lizard on his shoulder.  (Readers of Lewis will recognize this from his earlier essay 'Horrid Red Things' in \\"God in the Dock\\").  The lizard embodies the spirit's struggles with lust; it continuously goads him on.  As the spirit comes into contact with one of the heavenly angels, the angel states that if the man will only ask him to, he will kill the lizard.  The lizard immediately warns the spirit that the angel is capable of this and reminds the spirit that if this is allowed, he-the spirit-will never enjoy the pleasures of lust and sin again.  The spirit hems and haws, asking the angel many questions.  Each time the angel responds \\"...MAY I KILL IT?\\"  <br />It is heartbreaking to read as the spirit decides to allow the angel-hands hovering just around the neck of the lizard-to kill it, only to relent when he realizes that he himself will be hurt in the process of obtaining freedom.  The angel responds: \\"I never said it would not hurt you, only that it would not kill you.\\"  This seems eerily similar to so many of us in the 'real' world who, when offered freedom thru Christ and the solutions to our myriad of social, emotional, spiritual, and physical struggles, raise an angry hand to God and reject His offer.  How many of us want our problems to be fixed, our wounds healed and our pain dealt with-without any pain!?  How many of us prefer to hold onto the very things that are destroying us?  Keeping us from God?  <br />A brilliant treatise on the ability of the human-in this case the spirit of departed humans-to rationalize and justify our behavior, whether it be an overbearing, controlling mother, a frightened woman, a man diseased with lust, those consumed by career, or any of the other characters in the book.  Look deeper because there is a message for everyone in this book.  A powerful allegory of the struggle to make the Gospel known to others.<br />Recommended.	2002-10-02

I shredded Reuters earlier 9/11 book, but this one seems refreshingly clear of soapbox lectures and political propagandizing.  This is the book Reuters SHOULD HAVE released earlier.  As one who has been to ground zero and taken many photographs, I will tell you that the photos in this book are reason enough to purchase it.  The record of the 9/11 aftermath contained within is STUNNING.  I found the text to be informative if not always necessary.  The photos really speak for themselves.  Along with Life magazine's 9/11 book, this is a keeper.  It is hard to believe that only months ago I stood so close to this sacred site...	2002-09-10

With trepidation I suppose?  Or not, for others...  Here I am going to review it like any other book.  You probably don't care about my feelings on the subject matter so I have limited myself to the book itself.<br />I've had this particular Bible since it was first released and have found it to be a fascinating read with enlightening footnotes and sidebars related to history.  Introductions to each book provide the reader with info on the Author, time of writing, location of writing, circumstances under which the book was written, and to whom the book was written.  Most 'study' Bibles include this sort of information.  This one however, includes interesting footnotes and profiles of major characters including their strengths and weaknesses.  There are also in-depth sections related to Bible prophecy, specifically those that were fulfilled by Christ, and the inter-relationships of the Gospel accounts, how they show different perspectives on the same events and how each tends to highlight different themes or events.  Also included are a helpful index in the back and a well-written introduction about the origins of this particular study edition.  Study maps in the back provide a good reference point for many of the accounts contained within.  <br />I have had this Bible for years and I've enjoyed reading it.  A more serious study of these texts might look to a Ryrie or Scofield study Bible or perhaps John MacArthur's revised New King James version which includes much info and disection of the original Greek and Hebrew texts.  Hence the minus one star.  Most people are not scholars of Hebrew or Greek so this rating can be taken with a grain of salt.  <br />A good Bible for the starter or the mature believer.  The Life Application Study Bible is easy to read and thought-provoking.  Careful tho, these words may just change your life.  You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.  Indeed.	2002-09-03

The book does a nice job portraying the decay of urban infrastructure through pictures-when it sticks to &quot;Chicagoland&quot;.  Apparently, this geographic area extends all the way into Michigan (why?).  For the money, the author could have stuck to Chicago proper alone and produced a much better book.  It's not like you have to go out of the city to find these types of areas.  The section on the Pullman district was especially good.  The photos have a haunting quality to them.  You can almost hear the trains roaring by and the bustle of the little enclave.<br />Worth taking a look at if you can find an open copy at a bookstore.	2002-07-11

This wonderfully executed book on the 9/11 tragedy is by far the best of the twenty plus that I have viewed.  The best thing in this volume is the gripping recapping of the events of that day complete with AMAZING photographs that flow along a timeline.  The pictures are of the highest quality, many of them I had not even seen before.  The inclusion of photos of 'ordinary' Americans near the end is also quite haunting.  <br />I highly recommend this book, rather than some others (Reuters for one) that used the tragedy as a platform to promote various causes.	2002-05-24

If you 'Need A Break?' during your walking, there are literally hundreds of highlighted cafes, corner deli's, candy shops, and bakaries for you to peruse-separated by neighborhood and borough. <br />This book is divided into different chapters, the first dealing mainly with Manhattan and its different neighborhoods. Want to visit the grill/movie studio owned by actor Robert De Niro? It's in here. Want to visit the former homes of any number of famous New Yorkers? Or the bar in which poet Dylan Thomas supposedly drank himself to death? The restaurants where Hemingway and others wrote? Prohibition-era speakeasy's? All these and much more are expounded upon.<br />There is a dizzying array of info on museums, nightclubs, music clubs, restaurants, transit systems, and tours. My wife and I have been devouring this book in the months before our trip to NYC. It has been a blast. The beginning of the book also includes some nice color photography of various key sights and Fodor's has done readers a great service by listing its 'moments not to miss' on one page (things like where to be for a great sunset or the most romantic restaurant etc.).<br />Also helpful are numerous itineraries for walking tours based on a 3 day or 5 day trip to NYC. The inside cover includes a checklist of items to cover in the months up to your trip (reservations, finances etc.)<br />After returning from our trip, my wife and I can say that this book was a MASSIVE help to us.  We carried it around in our bag and stopped each day once or twice to review it as we walked around.  A great resource.	2002-05-21

Dan does a nice job here providing lots of information on the development of the script, the circumstances of the adaptation from the french novel, the shooting sequences, and the relationships of the actors and actresses once the camera stopped rolling. <br />Vertigo is my favorite film and I was generally pleased by this book. My only complaints concern numerous printing/spelling errors that I came across. These errors do not contribute to any misinformation about the film, but they are annoying. The reproductions of various movie posters and pictures from the set throughout the book are a nice addition. This book is a must for film buffs-especially Hitchcock film fans. Dan makes a convincing argument for the claim of many who say this is the master's best film.  Hopefully some of the typographical errors in my first edition will be corrected in the future-nothing major, but enough to drop my rating one star. <br />Highly recommended.	2002-05-08

Goldberg does a great job of bringing this issue out into the light.  Although many liberals (if not most) can easily dismiss such assertions as 'right-wing lunacy', here we hear from an insider himself.  For myself, this book is merely more documentation of my view that something stinks within the traditional news media outlets.  <br />I used to love to watch the news, even as a kid I watched Peter Jennings almost every night.  I loved being 'up' on what was going on in the world.  But as a grew older-especially thru high school-I found myself increasingly cringing at some of the comments made by Jennings and others.  Why did they phrase the argument THAT way?  I would wonder.  Why do they spend so much time on one aspect of the problem and little or none on the other aspects?  And why do they do this while blathering on and on about equal time and treatment?  Well, surprise, surprise, turns out the establishment in the news media tend to think in a rather monolithic way, and EVERYONE who doesn't see things that way is either an <br />a) extremist, <br />b) religious nut, or <br />c) an old time southern GOP racist or conspiracy nut.  <br />You simply CANNOT have a brain and disagree with the higher-ups in the media!..I mean, the thought of independant thought to them is scary.<br />What is enlightening here is that Goldberg tells us HOW all of this is done.  It's not so much a product of sinister closed-door meetings among executives, as it is a product of the mindset that is embraced, encouraged, maintained, and promoted within news organizations.<br />Kudos to Mr. Goldberg for dragging these organizations into the light (albeit kicking and screaming).  An example of a great exchange in the book is Mr. Goldberg's quoting of famous New York Times film reviewer Pauline Kael who, after Nixon won the 1972 election stated: <br />\\"I can't understand how Nixon won.  I mean, no one I KNOW voted for him.\\"  (emphasis added)<br />Mr Goldberg astutely replied, \\"Mrs. Kael, Nixon carried 49 states for God's sake!  That's why he won!\\"  (paraphrased).  The point being, media liberals are so ensconsed in their own world, with those who think like them, that they actually begin to believe that the rest of the world thinks as they do.<br />This is not only an informative book, but it's also very entertaining and quite funny at times.  Open your eyes folks, and see the endless wasteland before you that is network news.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-05-06

William Shirer, a journalist/broadcaster stationed in Berlin in the 1930s and 40s, had a unique opportunity to witness Adolph Hitler's rise to power.  Few can say they attended Nazi rallies or stood behind Hitler as he delivered some of his famous speeches.  Shirer, the consummate narrator, delivers his experiences to the rest of the world in this book, first published in 1960.  It covers Hitler's young life and many experiences that probably helped form his anti-semitism.  It is fascinating to see how many of these major characters of the last century came together at first in small restaurants and bars, and later in stadiums before hundreds of thousands of Germans.<br />This book remains one of the great docu-historical writings of the twentieth century.  Part history and part opinion, it is quite stunning in scope and character.  True, Shirer does occasionally transcend his role as journalist, delivering intense personal opinions on characters from Ribbontrop to Goering to Goebbels.  Some have faulted him for this, but I liked it.  Who else would be in a better position to deliver such information?  If Shirer has spent the time with these people-if he knows enough of them, then by all means, he should expound in this manner.<br />This is a very long book.  At 1200-some pages, It was daunting and enjoyable at the same time.  While some details blurred over time, the amount of information erred on the safe side-better too much than too little.  While this is a valid criticism, it has no bearing on my feelings regarding the book when all is said and done.  This is masterful history mixed with first hand drama and (despite what some have said) intense documentation.<br />Essential and highly recommended.	2002-04-29

Porter includes loads of information; stories, interviews, copies of Coltrane's musical scriblings etc.  He also disects the music quite intensely-perhaps a bit much for me.  I do play a variety of instruments and I read choral music ok, but some of the discussions contained herein are frankly, too difficult for me to understand on paper-I have always learned music by listening to it.  So if you are like me, you may want to go to a bookstore and page thru this work before buying it.  As I said, it has been a good experience but I probably would have finished it last year if it were a less technical read.  Thankfully, Porter does a good job of breaking up the more technical portions of the book with great narrative.  I have been able to pick out and understand his larger points without completely grasping all the music theory.  My hat is off to those who can read this cover to cover and understand it all!

Lewis expounds wonderfully on many subjects here that should be of interest to all: is their a higher power or causative force in the universe?, if so, is this the God described in the Bible or some other being?, good & evil, Natural & moral law, Ethics, Virtue, Christian belief, Atheistic belief, hope etc. This book is basically short (usually not more than 4 or 5 pages) excerpts from his other writings compiled to give the reader a good overview. <br />The title of the book actually refers to the court system. When someone is called as a witness during a trial, the podium they sit or stand at is called the 'dock.' So if someone is 'in the dock' they are being questioned and critiqued. In other words, this book is meant to be a serious questioning of God and his actions as one might question a witness in a trial. But not only that; here Lewis explains-as only he can-his views on how and why and where and when and to what extent there is a God operative in the universe. Read the chapter \\"Horrid Red Things\\" and then read his book THE GREAT DIVORCE to see how the two are tied together.<br />Essential.	2002-02-08

I do believe that after Stalingrad there was no way for the Germans to win.  I have felt this ever since reading William Shirer's &quot;Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot; years ago.  This book only further convinced me of this.  A great book.	2002-02-06

Very detailed, very interesting and a rather quick read. The wealth of information is staggering as are the personnal accounts of that day. Recollections by veterans are priceless.  A sobering reminder of the price of freedom, a price we will be called upon to pay from time to time...	2002-02-06
US	44490642	R2KFAYA0XCV5B6	0060652926	338167986	Mere Christianity	Books	5	2	4	N	N	The one to start with...	Here we see one of the most brilliant minds of the last century explaining his distaste with the Christian religion and how he came full circle to eventually embrace it. Lewis' stature can not be questioned; a man of seemingly limitless intellect, he found himself the lynchpin for many a Christian with questions and many a seeker with doubts. Lewis was an agnostic until mid-life when his unending search for truth and meaning brought his path alongside J.R.R. Tolkien's. Over time Lewis had gone from atheist to theist to eventually embracing the message of Christ. He could hardly believe it himself! <br />This work is a classic. Originally compiled from a series of radio programs in Britain, it has been a best-seller ever since and impacted millions of lives. His insights into Natural and Moral law as well as virtue are mind-expanding to say the least. I will not presume to explain Lewis' arguments better than he, so just buy the book!	2002-02-06

Very detailed-perhaps too much for some-it reads fairly easily and each section can be read alone.  As someone has already said, it is almost a compendium of college level lectures put together, but in my opinion it seems more coherant and fluid than that.  In any case, this is a great book that is highly recommended.  The photos included are amazing to say the least.	2002-02-05

Some are more meaty than others.  There are some very good arguments for the existence of a higher power (i.e. God) here and it is interesting to see the father struggle thru his tough questions until the end of the book.  Recommended.	2002-02-05

I found it interesting, informative, and thought-provoking.  However, due to the nature of the collection there is not as much given to each topic as could be hoped.  Not quite as in-depth as it should be, but a good starting point.	2002-02-05

Ryan brings many different lives and stories together in one horrid account of the collapse of the Reich. It's almost like reading about your neighbors as you follow these people through to the end. Ryan does not hesitate to give us all the details as the citizens of Berlin came under the heel of the conquering Russians. The pictures in this 50th anniversary addition are stunning. As important as the best Hitler biographies and Shirer's RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH.<br />Essential reading.	2002-02-05

Incorrect statements about this book abound.<br />Behe says plainly early on that he is NOT out to prove there is a GOD as envisioned in the bible. He simply says that scientific advances seem to point to a designer of these complex systems- without regard to who that designer is. For all we know maybe he believes that designer to be some alien life form? Anyway, this is a complex yet easily readible book that makes a few very compelling arguments for a designed world. While some argue that the existence of a higher power (a designer) cannot be proven, a PREPONDERANCE of evidence can still direct us to one conclusion or another. I still have not seen ANY credible reporting on how many of these 'molecular machines' could have evolved. What would have been their worth in the interim stages? I am certainly no expert in Biochem, but please explain to me how the correct pieces could have all come together in the right sequence and amount at just the right time and temperature to form 'machines' that would have little or no purpose in and of themselves?!  Does this strike anyone else as a VERY valid question?!  And how would the astronomically unlikely coalition of the above -for the sake of argument- give us LIFE?  If macro-evolution were so obvious and rampant in the world today, Mr. Behe would never have written this book.  Point in fact, there is not ONE example of macro-evolution that can survive the rigors of scientific documentation and, most of all...(for you scientific method fans) be witnessed or reproduced.  These are the issues tackled by Prof. Behe in this intriguing book.  Occasionally, portions of the narrative can be heavy reading indeed.  Thankfully the author sets them off with a cube symbol so that those who don't want to brave the chemical onslaught can move along to more easily understood portions.  I read everything anyway because whether or not you understand all of the processes at work, one thing become crystal clear: the odds of these interdependant processes arising 'just right' are probably unmeasurable. <br />Time will tell how insightful this book is, but as for me I found it informative and thought provoking at the least. Recently I was at a large bookstore chain and they had a huge table on the ground floor packed with books and a sign above them reading \\"SCIENCE\\". I found numerous books on and by Darwin being held up as science (this of course, before Darwin himself could have known *anything* about molecular biology).  [Not that Darwin wasn't smart for his time, but the whole point of DARWIN'S BLACK BOX is that recent advances in molecular biology and chemistry have put macro-evolutionists at pains to explain how it could have worked.  Behe states that mankind needs to move beyond this outdated theory and embrace one that does not fly in the face of recent scientific advances.]  At this same bookstore table I found nothing by Michael Behe, a guy who teaches bio/chem at a public university for crying out loud, nothing on the fossil record (WHERE are the transitional forms?), rock formations and striations etc.  Nothing from ANYONE who held any viewpoint that differed from Darwin or Stephen J. Gould. Let's hear it for free-thought folks.<br />I've seen more real (read: honest) science in Behe's book than in any text that supports evolution (hey, I went to public school you know!) and valiently tries to argue for order out of chaos-isn't that contrary to the second law of thermodynamics?-systems inevitably descend from order into chaos don't they? Yet incredibly complex life forms somehow ordered themselves over many years? HOW?  I've tried and tried to will it to happen, but I just can't seem to force myself to grow two extra arms and an extra brain so I can be twice as productive at work...	2002-02-04

First off I must state that this book stands on the merits of its philosophical arguments. I also have to respond to one reviewer (an atheist) who said 'why not let atheists define what they are?' all the while telling us exactly what a Christian is...gee that's great pal. Let the stereotyping begin!<br />Zacharias is a philosopher of high repute (common folks-he lectures at Cambridge, Harvard, Princeton, Oxford etc) and his arguments make sense at the most rudimentary levels. The REAL problem for atheists and agnostics is that he asserts things that upset them. He's rocking the boat too much for some I guess. His arguments regarding humanistic philosophy are correct-not that all atheists are going to commit mass murder. That type of hysteria from atheists ('He thinks we're all killers!') is pointless nonsense. (I have heard him speak and I assure you he does NOT say this.) His point is that someone truly following Christ's example has no excuse for wrongdoing while the humanistic/atheistic 'believer', having taken that belief to ONE (read: not the only) natural destination becomes the be-all and end-all of existence; everything exists for that person & to be used by that person. They are the ultimate authority and accountable to no one but themselves. This is precisely the world view held by Hitler and Stalin (among others). While Christ was a servant to others and provided humans with a blueprint for behavior, the atheist/agnostic has rejected that blueprint in favor of their own subjective sense of right and wrong.<br />And of course the example of the crusades has been brought out again. Obviously the things that happened during the crusades were wrong. Who would argue with that? Those responsible for them (and other terrible acts) were NOT following Christ's example of love and sacrifice. Let's be clear: a true Christian will never advocate or participate in activities that will demean, injure, slander, or kill another person (war is another matter...)(Some people seem to be unable to differentiate between a common joe who says he/she is a Christian and tries to live as a follower of Christ's teachings, and a nut who shoots an abortion doctor and then tells people God told him to.  These people are deceived and evil.)<br />Hitler, seizing the day and attempting to draw all power to himself, thought nothing of destroying millions of lives in his own selfish pursuit, claimed-at least publically-to be a defender of the Christian faith. [Those who still insist Hitler was a Christian (don't make me laugh) should check out the newly released Nuremburg war trial documents at the online Journal of Law and Religion at Rutgers University]<br />Some folks are just sour grapes when it comes to some of the topics addressed here. Don't believe the naysayers-I urge you to pick up this book and read it thru at least twice before commenting-this is thick reading. Zacharias even includes a section at the back with transcripts of some of his question and answer sessions with Harvard students during the Veritas Lectures.  He answers quite clearly some of the very questions that have been raised by other reviewers here.  I guess they just didn't read thru the whole book...<br />See for yourself what the ruckus is about. I guarantee it will be thought-provoking. If you come into this arena with a chip on your shoulder it will become evident quite quickly.	2002-02-04
