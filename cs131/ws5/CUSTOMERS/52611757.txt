But not to fear, her man came through because, why?  Well,<BR>because he forgot their anniversary, of course.  How mundane.<BR>How totally uninspired.  This is just a disappointment.  It IS<BR>sugary-sweet.  No doubt about it.  When Noah finally decides to<BR>win her romance back, he ..... sprinkles rose petals and draws<BR>a bath; leaves a note that says &quot;pick the bath oil you want.&quot; Yawn.  Brilliant.  This is a sad case of we all went<br />out and bought a book based on the first, and someone sat in<BR>his chair typing this thing out knowing we would all along.	2003-10-30

As we share a bowl of blueberries with a child  we might say, &quot;yum, such sweet, round, fresh blueberries.&quot; The author writes this book as we would talk to a child just learning the world ... his or her shapes and colors, etc.  We certainly would not say &quot;Such sphere shaped blueberries.&quot;  And this is why the author was not only careful in what she wrote, but accurate and true. A lovely concept book for children learning what the shape of round looks like.  We also have WHAT IS SQUARE? at our house and I've gone back to look; every item is indeed a square. The photo of the patch on the knee may lean toward having two sides a tad longer than the other two, but the 'text' reads 'patch on your knee.'...so this is nonsense to say the author was not careful with text. A lovely, colorful book in a series.  WHAT IS A TRIANGLE? is our favorite. I just saw these listed in a magazine article for the best books to buy for toddlers learning shapes and even colors.	2001-06-25

The word is out; there is no 'typical' junior high. I was raised in the 50's, lived in a nice neighborhood, was a fairly ordinary teen.  But guess what? One of my friends was indeed beaten by her father. And one was in fact abandoned by a religious-fanatic father. And yes, there were rapes.  And boys who reminisced about first loves. There were also those who did their homework, cooked suppers, played the cello and on and on.  But, where's the story.  Teenagers today face issues that many people refuse to admit.  Or want to hear.  Or know. That is sad.  Because it is tough.  Hallways are places that are filled with contagious laughter and horrible sadnesses. Dances too.  Dances especially. And let's don't overlook what wonders the stories have to offer; the stolen kisses, the kisses dreamed of, the tender moment of dancing itself. These characters have heartache. And courage. It's the kids who aren't ordinary who encounter<br />the world in a not so safe place, but learn to live in it anyway. I, for one, will recommend all teens read this book. I have two words for this book; evocative, magical.	2001-05-25
