It plods along with the reader being told to believe that a woman goes to takes care of her \\"sick\\" mother but all she does for her is bandage her a few times a day and doesn't get the woman help until it's almost too late.  The mom is going insane!  An idiot could see that!  Jessie is a psychiatrist's wife for goodness sake, so she has no excuse.  The reason for the ignoring of her mother I think is simple though....she's much too busy having an instant affair with a wannabe monk.  I can't feel happy for an adulterer and her accomplice.  The other characters are cliche, silly and boring but we're supposed to like them because they have a secret.  I must admit the secret at the end is why I rated the book as a 2 and also the husband Hugh was the only character I actually liked.	2005-07-22

Alison, the main character, is a teenage girl  who lives with and through the sudden death of her 18 year old brother, but the book is so much more.  Her relationships with family & friends is what is so interesting.  No clean-cut endings here.............	2004-08-16

While I love a good family saga, I cared nothing about any of the characters in this book.  It was tedious, boring and repetitive.  The premise of how an act in childhood affects members of several families for years to come seemed intriguing, but it was the only reason that held me to the end and then I realized that the book was actually a waste of time.	2004-03-10

I learned an awful lot about the physical aspects of MS but also appreciated reading about the psychological toll that MS has taken on Montel Williams.  I have respect now for someone who has opened himself up to try to help others understand this awful disease.  This is an honest and frank story that he tells but at times it becomes repetitive and almost preachy.  I don't have MS, so I can't fault the way he handles his life, but I do think that his would be a good book for MS sufferers and non-sufferers alike to read.	2004-02-11

As with all the other books I've read by Elizabeth Berg, this one grabbed me from the very start.

If you've never read a Danielle Steel book before you probably would think this is quite a juvenile book.<BR>I wonder when Ms. Steel will go back to writing mature love stories like she did many years ago?<BR>So much repetition of phrases, everyone is either handsome or pretty in the books she writes and they usually have money.  The story lines are interchangeble; just change the character names.<BR>The book is quick reading, but ultra-light in content.	2003-05-08

I was on a waiting list at the library for it so I was eager to read it, but I must say it was tedious reading.  I wanted to give up several times but thought I should continue, so I was quite dissapointed when I came to the end and nothing was resolved.  I soon tired of Harriet's sullenness.  Although the other characters were well written, there was no pay-off.<BR>If you have a lot of time on you hands, go ahead and try it, otherwise I think you should pass on this one.	2003-01-23

I was looking forward to reading this book based on the plot and the author's reputation, but after reading it I just don't think it was worth it.  The character of \\"Anellia\\" was interesting but tiring.  How does someone so intelligent fall in love with a man that is mentally abusive and even physically abusive towards the end?  I know she had a bad childhood.....oh I guess that's it....she's emotionally damaged so of course she wouldn't fall in love with a \\"normal\\" guy.  Vernor, her \\"lover\\" (but there was NO LOVE!) was drawn as a character with a  pseudo-intelligence that's masqueraded as a philosophical genius of some sort but  as geniuses go, he is a social misfit.  Yeah, very compelling (hear my sarcasm?)  He was boring and couldn't say much other than endlessly quote philosophers.  The sex scenes were without feeling and totally demeaning.<BR>The book was short but really, if it went on any longer I would've quit.	2002-12-04

This book was highly anticipated and I'm glad I got it at the library because had I purchased it, I would have been disappointed.  I really wanted to like it and I  usually love a thick book but it was just too tedious and with all the characters I could not find one that I even remotely liked.  Talcott was such a whiner and I didn't even care anymore if anyone ever found &quot;the arrangements&quot;.  <BR>As a black woman, may I say that this is a story about  this one black family, the Garlands, so please don't think it's representative of middle-class or wealthly blacks as a whole.   <BR>This could have been so much better.

I didn't like any of the characters, especially the grandad Mack, who was supposed to be so &quot;good&quot;.  He was irritating.  The &quot;trial&quot; was implausible and it's result  just made glad the book was over.   Why was nobody angry at the character Sammy who was one of the childhood circle of friends?  I never felt drawn into life at the Hamptons and wondered why it was set there and not in Bevery Hills or some other rich people's town.  I only hope that the disapointment with this book that I and others felt is due to the writing partnership here, no offense to Peter De Jonge.  Mr. Patterson has a definite style (Alex Cross novels) and we need to see that shine through, please.	2002-08-13

I kept waiting for a story to grab me like many of Mary Higgins Clark's earlier fare, but this one didn't do it, sad to say.  Rather plodding and lackluster.  I wonder at the proof-reading skills of the editor because on page 29 it said Ellie was 30 and on page 143 it said at the same time that she was 29 during the same incident .  Also it said on page 139 that a cheese, lettuce & tomato sandwich was all that there was to eat (refrigerated items obviously) and on page 144 it said \\"I also did not want to empty the refrigerator\\"  What was there to empty? (please note:  I quote these pages from the paperback version).  I know these are small things, but it shows how poorly the story was for me to even be able to pick up on these errors!	2002-07-16

This might be a small, sweet town but the main characters have the morals and depth of a raunchy big city.<br />The characters of Guthrie and Maggie who later in the book just have sex for no apparent reason as did the school secretary one night with Guthrie (still a married man, mind you) just turned me off.  There was no love there at all.<br />The McPherson brothers were interesting characters.  Victoria, the pregnant girl was a surprising character.  She starts out practically in denial of her pregnancy until her mom orders her out of the home and she is played as a sweet, forlorn character when taken into Maggie's home.  Then she goes to the McPherson brothers to live and just when she gets real settled into their lives to the point of them actually buying her a baby crib, she up and literally rides off with the boyfriend that dumped her because he shows up one day in the school parking lot!  She tells no one of her whereabouts, even after all that everybody has done for her!  I tired of her immediatlely at that point.  She does come back, but from then on the story is so that it doesn't make me care about any of the characters anymore, even Guthrie's 2 poor young boys.  I expected more of this book but was let down.	2002-06-14

Her books are usually predictable and I haven't read the last 2 or 3, but happened to get this one at the library for a \\"free\\" read.

(I'd read &quot;The Shell Seekers&quot; &amp; &quot;September&quot; some time ago and loved them!).  Elfrida was a very unlikable character and Oscar even more so, especially the plot line of making us believe that a close romantic relationship could take place in such an ridiculously short period of time....c'mon!!  When they moved into Oscar's new place shorttly after the death of his wife &amp; child, Elfrida says he was having nightmares, ...... is the cure to have sex?  Why did she feel from the start that when they moved to Oscar's new residence that he would be up for a relationship like that anyway when all along they'd been nothing but friends?  How disrespectful to his dead wife and child!

This is a silly book that little ones will think is fun, but for a parent trying to introduce potty training it leaves one wondering.......

I'm trying to  encourage my child to use a few sheets &amp; not to unravel the entire  spool of toilet paper!  Also there's not much in the way of a story to  read.
