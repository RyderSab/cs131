It is shocking some of the things these men go through. You will come to realize how we take things for granted like food, shelter, friends, etc. once you read this disturbing book.	2001-01-30

It is a story of a undesirable man who turns his life around and becomes almost like a Saint. From beginning to end I found no part boring or slow, it was all full of adventure. I would also recommend &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; if you are interested in reading &quot;Les Miserables&quot; or if you read it and enjoyed it.	2001-01-08

It tells how the samurai warrior had to live his life in order to be noble and respectable. I found that the advice it has to offer is very helpful even today. It is very short and easy to read.	2001-01-08
US	50962220	R2A6VQB9J2WXGG	1840240695	789822126	A Z of Conspiracy Theories	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Not to be taken seriously!	This book is geared for entertainment purposes only. There are hardly any theories in the book that could even have possibly happened. It is a good book if you are looking for a laugh but I wouldn't buy it if you are looking for something with a more serious conspiracy theory tone.	2000-12-09

It was really fun to read because it gives you an alternative perspective to what you have heard about certain events such as the JFK assassination and UFOs. It has a seriousness about it that makes every conspiracy seem like it definetley was a conspiracy. It was a good book.	2000-12-09

This seems to be a great book for aspiring law-enforcement officers. I hope to be in law-enforcement one day and I found the information in it to be great.	2000-12-09

I thought that the text was great and I also enjoyed the history of the discovery of the text at the end of the book. It gave me a new perspective on Jesus Christ as not only the Son of our Lord but as a wise teacher as well. I really enjoyed it.	2000-12-09

Yeats's poem, The Second Coming. It is a story of a mans life in Africa when the British are trying to colonize the area. I didn't really read to many books until I read this and it has really turned me on to reading because it was such a good story. I recommend it to anyone and all ages because it is so easy to read and enjoy.	2000-12-07

It made me really think about what the future is going to be like and hope that it is not like the one in a Brave New World. It is full of very interesting concepts, especially since it was written in the 1930's or so. Overall, I would recomend it if you like to read for enjoyment.	2000-12-01

After I got through the first 100 pages which were somewhat slow, the book began to pick up and then it was great. If you are interested in mystery books than this is one of the best out there.	2000-12-01
US	50962220	R33II8ECL0ZASW	0553575449	3893139	Deadly Force	Books	5	2	2	N	N	This book is great	Deadly Force was a great book. It takes you through what a United States Marshal goes through everyday. You get to read about the stakeouts, arrests, raids, etc. It is a good book if you are looking for something a little suspenseful and fun to read.	2000-12-01
US	50962220	R21YDAREITIDC3	0140433627	655343360	Frankenstein: Or the Modern Prometheus	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Great classic book	To me this book was great. At times it can be hard but not very often. It has a lot of deeper psychological meanings and thoughts if you take time to analyze this characters. It is a book basically about a struggle of good v. evil, but who really is the evil one, the monster or Frankenstein?	2000-12-01

It shows a young soliders struggle with courage and in the end he actually gains the courage to go into battle. At first I didnt understand the title, when I did I thought it to fit the story perfectly, he wants to be injured so that he may be proud of his &quot;red badge of courage&quot; and feel brave. Well, overall it was a good book.	2000-12-01
US	50962220	R3C7UPUTZS4DSK	0425165965	983349113	Timequake	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Interesting concept, I liked it, very creative!	I wouldn't recommend this book to a first-time reader of Kurt Vonnegut.  Nothing against the book, it is a really good one, but I personally think  that you need to understand how he writes before you jump into this one. It  is not like other books because all of Vonneguts' books are great but they  are not for everyone and this one especially if you haven't read a book of  his before. I thought it was really nice and funny book overall though.	2000-08-10

Most people can  relate with Holden and what he is going through. I really like it when you  can relate with the characters in books, that alone makes it worth reading.  Overall, it is a great story and i really enjoyed it. Remember, don't tell  anyone anything, or else you will just start to miss everything.	2000-08-10

This book isn't as great as The Count of Monte Cristo, The Three  Musketeers, or any of Dumass' other great works but it is a great book to  read. If you are interested in gothic fiction or mystery you should read  this book. I will tell you that the shock at the end of the book is worth  reading the whole thing for. Overall, I thought it was a great piece of  work.	2000-08-10

He really is a great guy and I think  that it is so great that we still have some people in government who aren't  afraid to speak up for the people and make a stand for something. That is  something that America has lost and that Gov. Ventura is trying to bring  back. What a great guy and a great book.	2000-08-10

This story has to  do with the human race as we know it being wiped out and replaced by some  sort of swimming humans through years of evolution. It is funny and has a  deeper meaning imbedded within the text as most of his novels do. Overall,  I would say that it is a great book and I really enjoyed it.	2000-08-10

To just  drop it all to live in the woods and live off the land. I admire him and  think that what he has to say is really important in both Walden and Civil  Obedience. They are great pieces of work and deserve some looking into.	2000-08-10

The only book I have read that has been  quite as intriging as this has been The Count of Monte Cristo, another one  of Dumass' books. All the twists and turns this tell has will literally  leave you shaking your head in amazment. I couldn't put this book down it  was so good I read all 560 pages or so in about two days!
