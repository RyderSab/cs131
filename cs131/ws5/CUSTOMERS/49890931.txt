In order to do this, the author focuses heavily on the work of Federico Garcia Lorca and his theories of Duende - a dark primal emotional state from which Lorca drew much inspiration. The back cover of the book gives a vast listing of other artists, authors and poets whose names are thrown out teasingly. Unfortunately, people like Hemingway, Plath, Blake and Rimbaud are only briefly touched upon in the book, while heavy emphasis is placed on Lorca's work. <br />As much as I find the concepts of Duende fascinating, I would rather just read Lorca's books. 'Demon and the Angel' suffers from misrepresentation, and readers should be warned. This is not a search for artistic inspiration. A description that is far closer to the truth would be 'Investigating Lorca's Theories and their Relationships to Other Artists'. <br />Still, it does prove a fascinating read, and the limited space all the other artists are given is still a decent sampling of their art. Pretentious at times, but still a fairly motivational book for writers and artists. Just be warned who the real star of the book is.	2004-06-01

There were two books that, for me, were the heavy hitters; 'Holy Blood and Holy Grail', the  fascinating yet ultimately unconvincing look into the connection between the life of Christ and Southern France, and Gardner's 'Bloodline of the Holy Grail'. <br />'Bloodline' is an extremely intriguing book. I devoured it relatively quickly, and overall quite enjoyed it. Gardner puts forth the same sort of heretical ideas 'Holy Blood' did, including the possibility that Jesus survived the crucifixion, possibly married Mary Magdelene, and had children whose ancestors make up some of the most important figures in royal history. It does this while tracing a meandering legacy from their union to modern day,  and includes the bloodlines links to the Arthurian legend, Tarot imagery, Freemasonry and early American history. <br />As fascinating as this all is, the book really stands on precarious legs. For one, Gardner is happy to provide footnotes for already established facts, yet the more intriguing details are simply stated. The author can easily tell us the name of Christ's daughter, a piece of knowledge that would be explosive if provided with evidence, but in no way documents where this information came from. It's quite easy to be caught up in teasingly naughty tidbits like this (I found myself giving out nanosecond-long gasps) but the reader should quickly realize that much of the 'history' mentioned is not backed up at all. The author also never explains the importance of the bloodline or his theories. If Christ wasn't the Son of God as proposed by the author, then why should we care who His great grandkids were? Gardner seems to show the crowd the ball he caught, but never runs with it. The books other weakness lies in the often bulky geneaologies presented. Pages upon pages of dry information take up the book, especially in the later chapters. <br />However, for all its plot holes, the assertions made never fail to spark curiosity. Definately the book will spark the imaginations of its readers and will cause many to ask questions. 'Bloodlines' never proves anything, with the exception that the ideas presented create a highly entertaining read. If you can get past the endless lists ( the book has more 'begats' than the Bible) and questionable conclusions, 'Bloodline of the Holy Grail' is a fun read.	2004-06-01

I was turned on to his high adventure writing with the Sipstrassi tales, ate up every Drenai novel he wrote and quested for the hard to find novels that weren't easily available. He is a great writer, with a knack for weaving fantasy storylines that play with complete believability.<br />As I read more of his later works, a fact I did not want to admit to myself started to rear its head  - Gemmell was repeating himself. Not only did he seem to be rewriting the same characters over and over again (only with different names) but plot points, settings and even dialogue repeated with great frequency.<br />With that said, I wanted to like White Wolf but in the end I just couldn't suggest it. Anyone who has never read his works should give it a shot, though I don't foresee this work creating any rabid fans. For someone who has read his Drenai novels (which White Wolf is, appearing somewhere in the beginning of the series chronology) this book will seem like old hat. Tortured hero with amazing killing skills embarks on impossible quest that'll take him through suicidal odds, accompanied by party of travellers (none of which you should become too close to.) Been there before, laddie. Of course, let's not forget to throw in some 'it's a good day to die' pragmatism to boot. Gemmell rehashes much of his warrior philosophy from his old works to such a degree that I thought I was rereading 'Quest for Lost Heroes' again. Throwing in his iconic Druss character was a nice addition, but even that seemed token. <br />All in all, this is a very mediocre novel written by one of the greats in heroic fantasy. Although packed with action and never boring, White Wolf still plays out like so many other books you've read before.	2004-05-31

I was pleased to read about the many different bands - some well known, some completely obscure to an alt-country stranger . The book gives a pretty definitive listing of bands whom the label applies to. The book also attempts to trace the bloodline of this musical branch through the history of americana music, starting from the early mountain ballads and southern gothic folk to the music of the big city 60's, further tracing to the anti-Nashville movements popping up all over the Texas area. From Dylan and Springsteen, to Calexico and Will Oldham, a wide variety of performers are given a good share of exposure. <br />This book is surely directed at those who would like a nice foothold in the alt-country world without spending hundreds on cd's and box sets. I don't think there is enough information for hardcore cowpunk fans, nor is there anything that would convert any country haters. For those who are even slightly fascinated with anti-country or americana music and need a good band primer, this is the book.	2004-05-04

'Origin' had the task of telling the beginnings of the character, and finally explaining what the up until now mysterious origins of the character were. This book tells a good story, throwing in some mildly obvious twists and tragedy to interest all readers. The art is beautiful, and gives the work an identity. The story itself seems to work better as an introduction, an feels unfinished. There is obviously so much more to tell of the characters beginnings, and anyone who picks 'Origins' up to read should understand it's not the complete origin of Wolverine, rather just the first chapter. A good read, and I can't wait for more.	2003-05-29

This is the perfect book for Terry Gilliam fans. It traces his history as an animator and director through the early years, into the Monty Python legacy and all the way to his feature films. This book is filled with color pictures from all of his projects, and even discusses some of the projects that never got off the ground.

I have to say that 'Dragons of a Fallen Sun' has rekindled my love for the Dragonlance series. After growing thoroughly apathetic with the new direction the books had taken (especially the depressing 'Downfall' by Jean Rabe) I was happy that there was a new book written by the original team of Weiss and Hickman. After just finishing the book, I can truly say these two were destined to continue this series. It seems that when the other authors who have been given the liberty of writing in the Dragonlance universe start to deviate from the path, Weiss and Hickman always manage to steer the series back on track. This book is the example. The authors do a great job of doing justice to classic characters while successfully integrating new characters that are endearing and well written. The story itself is epic, weaving multiple plot threads that warrant the 600 pages given to it. I am definately looking forward to reading the next book in the collection, something I have not said about a Dragonlance book in a longtime.	2003-02-08

The Harry Potter books, especially the second book 'Chamber of Secrets', are truly enjoyable reads. Whereas the first one served as a perfect introduction into the Potter world of Wizards, Muggles and everything in between, 'Chamber of Secrets' does what all sequels should; continue the story, elaborating what was said before without treading upon the original text. This book does just that. It introduces new characters and mythology while expanding upon the original ones. Not forgetting anything laid out in 'The Philosophers Stone', the sequel also hints at things to be seen in it's following novels. Great stuff! Can't wait to see the film!	2002-08-10

Fans of Star Wars will buy this book to complete their collections, and just might enjoy it for it's historic tale set in the far past of the Star Wars continuity. However, the tale is so bizarre that it bears almost no resemblance to the current Star Wars universe. For some it might be a drawing point, but I think others will be turned off by this. Non fans will turn away, as the story isn't particularly intriguing and the art is sub-par. The rest of the 'Tales of the jedi' stories are much better.	2002-08-03

It's a complete retelling of the Spiderman story. Although most plot elements remain the same (bitten by a radioactive spider, same costume, same characters) there are some points that are tweaked. Example is the characters, just as Peter Parkers Uncle Ben. Rather than a kindly old man like in the original comics, Uncle Ben here is an older hippie like figure. Little things like that are different, and if purists can get over that I think everyone will enjoy 'Ultimate Spiderman'. The art is good and the story moves along quickly enough.	2002-02-13

Obviously written for a younger teen audience, adults who love the Star Wars universe could still find some enjoyment in reading these. 'The Only Witness' isn't a very good book. The story is cobbled together last minute and the plot is totally uninvolving. It may have something to do with Watson coming off a multi-book story arc that was very good, and this book comes off as a sad epilogue. The very fact that there was a birthday party in the SW universe just didn't seem right.	2002-02-07

Dealing with the continuing invasion of sinister alien forces, this book deals more with Han Solo than any of the past New Jedi Order books had.

Ennis writes a great story here, bringing characters like Kit (John's short term love interest) and Matthew, a fellow cancer patient who Constantine gets close to. It all culminates with a satisfying conclusion thats both shocking and sweet. One of my favourites!	2002-01-30

Everything else just seemed like imitators playing in the same yard. Some books in the series do stand out of the pack, and 'Spirit of the Wind' is definately one of them. The story centers around Riverwind, one of the original characters from the first trilogy in the series. Riverwind is dying, and decides to leave the world not in a bed, but in battle. He volunteers himself to aid two poor souls in their attempt to defend their homeland against a hideous dragon. It's a story of sacrifice and bravery, and is very well written. At times it seemed to steal from David Gemmell's excellent book 'Legend', but all in all quite a pleasure to read.	2001-12-26

The only TSR series I am familiar with is the Dragonlance series, a great run of books but a series that has more poor entry's than good ones. I thought that this book, the first in the 'Legends of the 5 Rings' would be a weakly written money grab. Instead, it's a deep and fantastically written novel that opens up a beautiful new world for the reader.<br />The first book, 'Scorpion' does a great job of painting this new world. The series is pure fantasy, but with a more asian influence which is greatly appreciated. Noble samurai, stalking ninja and dejected ronin all share space with dragons and magic, and it's a refreshing change from the more western influenced fantasy that populates most of the bookshelves.<br />Great characters also prop up the story. What was appealing about the book was that there were no one-dimensional 'good' or 'evil' characters, just men and women who had their own perspectives. This poses an intriguing problem for the reader, as the fun of cheering the hero and booing the villain becomes an ambiguous task. It all depends on whose motivations you agree with most, and this vague morality made the story all the more enjoyable.<br />Definately a great read, and at 300 pages proves a slim, quick read that'll introduce you to a bold new world. Highly recomended.	2001-12-22

Even though the original books had been in colour, 'Essential's black and white gives it an almost 'Sin City' feel, making the gritty stories of Wolverines first issues in his own series all the more grittier. As for the paper stock, if getting all these issues in one book for less than 20 bucks means cheaper paper, then sign me up. All around, this book is a great read for Logan fans and a fantastic bargain for the collector.	2001-12-14

Well, that series must have been extremely confusing, because this first collection of 'The Authority' had me scratching my head.<br />First off, there is absolutely no introduction to any of the characters. They just appear and start bashing in bad guys heads. It's obvious that, disregarding what others have said, one should be familiar with 'Stormwatch' before attempting to read this. Otherwise, I am left to assume that readers are meant to just take these characters at face-value and understand why they are fighting a questionable villain.<br />The entire point of the story is lost in ambiguity as well. What are these people doing? Who are the villians? It's all pretty silly and the plot is brought together by the loosest of reasons. <br />I'm sure fans of 'Stormwatch' will have a ball with this comic. The fight scenes, however inexplicable, are still exciting, and the art is beautiful. The characters do have promise as well... if only we as readers had some idea of who the are.	2001-12-14

First off, it's hero refuses to wear a brightly colured costume, opting more for an outfit thats functional (he wears leather jacket because the air is too cold when flying). It's these elements that make 'Starman' and original and interesting read. Its 'reluctant hero' themes or ones that are used often in other books, but not as well as they are here. I really enjoyed reading about these characters, all well written and full of depth. This is a great book for comic fans looking for something a little different.	2001-11-28

His stint on Hellblazer was great, and Hitman and Preacher are seminal works. I just don't believe that Garth hit his stride until Preacher came along, and the proof is here in True Faith. Although the story has elements that would appear later in Preacher (and other Ennis works) the story is very poorly written. The dialogue is terrible, and the story just sort of putters out in the end. Some scenes, like the protagonists brain-dead family's conversations, are a little funny but don't really seem to work. Yeah, it's blasphemous, but the writing is a far more worse sin. For Ennis completists only.	2001-11-20

Well, the story didn't disappoint, as it dealt with not only that aspect but the romantic side of the character as well. Before Claremont and Miller got their hands on the fan-favourite character, Wolverine used to be a one dimensional violent character.

Sure, it doesn't match up to the original book, or any in the original series, but it was a mediocre look back at the characters and was mostly enjoyable. Unfortunately, 'House Harkonnen' isn't much better, and actually bogs down the series. Anderson feels he needs to explain everything, every detail that may have been brought up briefly in Frank Herberts original books. Also, his need to create relationships between every original character borders on irrititating, especially when some don't even make sense (Liet meeting Gurney so early in their lives is ridiculous, as they're meeting in the original 'Dune' was obviously the first) Also, it's terribly obvious that Anderson has absolutely no story to tell, and is happy to fill up book upon book with useless story filler that is completely unnecessary in the Dune universe. Yeah, the book is good for those who are incredibly desperate for Fremen/Spice/Atreides adventures. Otherwise, read with caution.	2001-11-14

Of course, like in all melodrama, this can't be allowed, as the daughter of his former love comes looking for him. Of course, there are those who seek revenge as well, and come looking for it.<br />'Redemption' is a good story. Not great, but it definately has all the elements for a fun read. There's some action (although not as much as most other Star Wars stories) plenty of angst and drama, and just a touch of romance. A good story and strong characters make this one of the better Star Wars graphic novels out there, and an excellent finale to the 'Tales of the jedi' series.	2001-11-08

That is why I found 'The Evil Dead Companion' somewhat disappointing, and not worthy of 5 stars at all. Out of all the movies in the trilogy, the author decides to focus mostly on the first film. Granted this is an interesting period in the film-makers lives, I would have preferred just as much in depth coverage into the other two films, 'Evil Dead 2' and 'Army of Darkness'. Unfortunately, they play a small part in the book. The stories of Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert and Bruce Campbell before the films came out are very funny and interesting, and do make up for the lack of other info. Also, the sparse photo's in the book (I really wish there was more) are all black and white, and with a film like this full colour ones would have done far more justice to the films.	2001-10-28

It gives us Star Wars completists the opportunity to finish off out collections. On that merit, In Deadly Pursuit is excellent. As far as the stories and art are concerned, well, I think they serve as nothing more than history lessons. Compared to today, they just don't match up. For Star Wars, these tales are a little too ridiculous in some instances, and do not match the work that is being done today by the likes of Zahn and Stackpole. Good for fans, but hardly important for story continuity.	2001-09-13

For a while, 'The Punisher' was a character in Marvel comics that really hit rock bottom with fans. In the 80's, the character had gained prominance with it's harsh, violent gun-toting look at vigilantism, but in the late 90's things weren't so good. Bounced from one boring, out-dated story to the next, Punisher was wasted.<br />That was until Marvel decided to reboot the series and allow the awesome team of writer Garth Ennis and artist Steve Dillon to helm a 12 issue mini-series. The two had worked on amazing titles like Hitman and the acclaimed Preacher series, and just as Marvel had hoped, brought the same magic to the pages of 'The Punisher'. <br />Collected in this trade paperback, this 12 issue story is a fun, exciting story that reminds fans why they so enjoyed the original Punisher stories to begin with.	2001-09-05

For an armful of books now, Luke Skywalker and the gang have been cleaning up the mess that began when the original trilogy of films ended. Now, after 25 years of backstory, the evil Empire has been vanquished. Now a new threat arises, as a mysterious and violent race of beings have emerged and threaten to conquer the galaxy. Time to grab those blasters and lightsabers once more!<br />I enjoyed Vector Prime a lot more than many fans have, and although it isnt a great book, its certainly lightyears better than some of the other garbage that has been printed under the Star Wars name. <br />The story is a great start for this brand new era. Salvatore manages to juggle both classic and Expanded Universe characters and employ them in a unified direction. Too many authors have succombed to temptation in using and reusing the characters from the original trilogy. While thats not a bad thing (and probably a popular decision) I feel it's important to usher in new characters and cement them in the continuity. Its the only way to assure the future of the series, and Salvatore does a satisfactory job. Also, a move that the author made in the story - killing off a MAJOR character in the novel - was unpopular and was met with great contreversy, but I felt it added depth to the universe. Now, nothing is definate and everything is up in the air, creating far more suspense than the past novels had.<br />[...]Star Wars has always been more fantasy than sci-fi, and Salvatores past experiance with the Forgotten Realms books offered up so much promise. Unfortunately, he seemed to concentrate more on the biology of the aliens than the swashbuckling nature that made the movies so great. <br />All in all, a good book and a great start to a whole new universe.	2001-09-05

Those who are familiar with the comics will see many of the characters they are familiar with in a completely different light. Here we find out what happens to the likes of Spider-Man, the X-Men and Captain America in a world where everyone suddenly develops super-powers. The story deals with issues like 'what makes someone special' while entertaining the reader with a conspiracy laden story that is bound to keep you reading until the work is finished. The art is very old-school, and was a nice shout out to the original artists of some of these characters. This was an excellent work, a definate milestone in comics.	2001-08-21

A nice temptation to seek revenge, and revenge is at the heart of the stories compiled in this, the first collection of this series.<br />'First Call, Last Call' contains 3 seperate stories involving a different character who gets their lives changed by Agent Graves, the enigmatic man with the gun and the penchant for vengeance. They're decent tales, not as genius as some of touted the series to be, but pretty interesting. They have definately intrigued me to find out what happens next, as the second story hinted that there is more going on than just a crazy guy with a gun.<br />As far as the series goes, I havent read the rest of the issues, but 'First Call, Last Call' is a pretty good intro into the series. They didn't super-impress me by any means, but were pretty good.	2001-08-03

Fans of the comedian and show should already be familiar with the material presented, while those who have not experianced his &quot;observational comedy&quot; will be introduced to his material. I suggest that those in the latter should give it a try, though, as the material is very funny. However, the book itself may be the wrong medium to be introduced to the material. I often found that, being a fan, i was laughing as I read simply because I remembered Jerry's act. To get a better experiance, rent his &quot;I'm Telling you for the Last Time&quot; video.	2001-06-29

Rather than go on about his deathmatches, injuries, and Al Snow jokes (oh wait, those are in there) Foley focuses on telling things how he believes they are. In fact, my favourite part of &quot;Foley Is God&quot; is the last quarter of the book where he discusses the various problems that the WWF has encountered recently. The chapter on the PTC (Parents Teachers Council, a group bent on cleaning up TV by ridding us of wrestling) is extremely informative, and would challenge anyone who believes that &quot;wrestling is evil&quot;.<br />At the most, this book is an enjoyable look at a sport truly loved by its author. It shows wrestling in it's true light, which makes this a perfect read for non-fans. Although it does lag in places, the book more than makes up for the weak spots with stories like Foley's encounter with Britney Spears and the setimental look at the late Owen Hart. This is definately the most honest, indepth look at wrestling you'll ever pick up.	2001-06-25

Those who have enjoyed the film and want to catch up on what happened after the movie will be in for a big surprise, however, as the story takes drastic turns.<br />The Sacred Princess Elora, who appeared as just a baby in the film, has finally reached her teen years and is almost ready to fulfill her prophecy. Unfortunately she has grown into a spoiled rich-girl and isn't the most pleasant messiah a world could have. Behind her rise, however, is a dark force which seeks to imprison the good guys and bring all around chaos to the world. Only a small (figuratively and literally) bunch of heroes can rise up and save the day.<br />Although this sounds like typical fantasy fare, Chris Claremont and George Lucas have turned the world of 'Willow' upside down with 'Shadow moon'. Don't expect a light hearted, childish romp like the film generally was. This book is grim, and sometimes very unpleasant to read. Perhaps this particular take was drawn by comparing it with the film, but any way you look at it, 'Shadow Moon' is a dark, violent and humourless book.<br />On the plus side, I had to commend the authors for bravely taking the story into a different direction. On it's on, the story reads like common fantasy fare. Include the film as canon, and you have a pretty deep and engrossing world. Not an easy book to read, but one that will more than likely have you picking up the sequel.	2001-06-22

The Dragonlance series continues to be one of the longest running fantasies, and although the line has had some truly great novels, most have been blatant money-grabs and amateurish attempts at writing within the framework. Thankfully the series regularly comes home to its rightful owners - Margret Weis and Tracy Hickman. 'Soulforge' is one of the better novels in the series. Written by Weis, it tells the tale of Raistlin Majere, arguably one of the most popular characters in the series, and his origins. We are given a big chunk of his life, from when he was just a child to the fateful Test in the Tower of High Sorcery. For the DL completist, the book fills in many holes in the lives of the original characters. For newbies, this is the perfect book for being introduced to the Dragonlance line of books. Well written, it's a great book for fantasy fans.	2001-06-14

Personally, I couldn't wait to finish the thing... and thanks to it's short 300 pages, that wasn't too much of a chore.<br />The back of the book promises a story of the Black Queen and the rise of the White Rose, her enemy who has been reborn as a young girl. It promises that the Black Company, the battlehardened soldiers from the first book, would be caught in the middle and their very lives would be in jeopardy!<br />So where was that story?<br />Instead we are treated to some guy who double-crosses his wife, some guys who steal urns from an underground cemetary and some mentions of the black company. It took 200 of the 300 pages to even mention the White Rose. After reading the disappointing first book in the series, I was hoping that this one would shed some light on what that first one was lacking. It just confused me more. <br />There is absolutely not a single interesting or well-developed character in 'Shadows Linger'. At least the first had Croaker, but even he is cast aside as a second string character. The names flit right past the reader, without anything to hook the reader in. Perhaps the characters themselves are the 'Shadows' that 'Linger'... shadows that would be fortunate to be called one-dimensional.<br />That aside, the story itself was just uninteresting. There's more plot development on the back cover blurb than there is in the actual novel. Some of the plot elements had absolutely no motivation behind them. It was as if Glen Cook was purposely leaving out details like &quot;Why on earth are they doing this?&quot; <br />... Meanwhile, I'm going to highly suggest fantasy fans stay away from this directionless time-waster.	2001-05-08

What the reader gets instead are weak 20-30 page stories that offer absolutely nothing for the reader that may intrigue, educate or even entertain. The authors who contributed seem to be accomplished writers in their own right, but that is not evident with these stories. Some are poorly written (such as &quot;The City of Brass&quot;) and others deal with the topic of the Templars in ridiculous ways. One thing that really bothered me was the addition of Kurtz's short story that takes place within the story of her own series of books! Basically, I would have to read her books to make even the slightest sense of the short story. Very poorly thought out. The best thing about this collection (and the only reason I gave it two stars) were the Interludes between stories, which offered up some basic info on the Knights. Definately not worth buying this book for, though.	2001-04-27

I was happy that he continued the story of Waylander, previously chronicled in two other books. And it was great to have another Gemmell book to read. Sadly this is one of his weakest attempts, and is an unfortunate finish to the great Waylander saga.<br />It seems that Mr. Gemmell has fallen into a bit of a rut. Although the Rigante books were very good, 'Hero in the Shadows' offers up nothing new in story or characters. Aside from a few of the main characters, the setting bears little resemblance to past Waylander books. Which makes sense, as the setting is different and does make the story new and interesting in that respect. But it didn't work, as this book didn't feel like it was truly part of the series. <br />Many of the characters were also haphazardly put together from bits and pieces of previous characters. There's Yu Yu, who fits the role of 'coward turned hero in face of adversity'. Keeva is the requisite 'strong female presence with the hard life' story. There's also an invulnerable wizard villain whom I feel like I have seen before.<br />What bugged me the most was the recycled plot elements that Gemmell seems to be fixated on (animal/man hybrids, parallel universes, weapons that glow when evil nears, etc.) <br />Aside from these faults, Gemmell still proves that his worst is better than most peoples good. The book is well written, and no one writes a fight scene better than this guy. I know that Gemmell is better than 'Hero in the Shadows', and could've turned out another Legend if he wanted to. I just hope this novel isnt a taste of things to come.	2001-04-27

The name is the A in the A,B,C's of science fiction, and I wanted to see why this man was so touted. Well I got my lesson! 'Prelude to Foundation' was an amazing book. Though some have reported that it was boring in places, I found the 500+ page book to just flow along. Asimov sets up an interesting premise with the decaying galactic Empire, and the adventures of those who seek to save it. What pleased me the most about this book was the different aspects Asimov manages to tie together. It tackles everything from science (obviously), the nature of religion, prejudice, politics, human nature and even manages to fit in some action scenes. What surprised me even more was the tender scene in the final section. I always saw sci-fi as a cold, technology driven genre, but Asimov actually manages to create some romantic tension between the characters that ties up nicely in the end. An awesome book, and a series I will definately continue.	2001-04-20

I always had the feeling these so-called &quot;authors&quot; were using that market to make money off of people who really want decent Christian books. Frank Peretti's works were an exception (highly suggest his works) and I was hoping this much touted series would be another. That was the real deception.<br />'Left Behind' deals with the characters that are left behind after the great Rapture of souls to heaven. Those that are left must deal with a new horror as a very blatant Anti-Christ rises up, possibly bringing a 7 year reign of horror and the true end of the world. <br />Although the setting has such promise, the execution is no less than terrible. As a reviewer had written here before, the writing is atrocious. The authors tend to describe everything in the most simplistic terms. One scene which made me shudder was when a character was viewing a tape that a minister had left behind (pun intended) to help out those that didn't get raptured. In what could have been a gripping scene - this abandoned fellow who now seeks salvation through the video - turns into nothing more than a cheap ad for Christianity. The ministers dialogue is actually written down for us to read. It would have been far more effective to just write that he had listened to the tape, then concentrate on his thoughts of the message. Instead we get the minsiter sermonizing, and the poor dope listener simply responding with &quot;oh yeah, thats good. I should do that.&quot; A weak scene which whose intention was not to further the story, but to preach to the readers.<br />Besides the writing, the entire plot is ridiculous. People mysteriosly disappear off the face of the planet; you would expect mass hysteria in the streets. None of this is played up, though, and the left behind crew are far more interested in this new Romanian politician (aka AntiChrist) than the mass disappearance. Huh? <br />The characters are weak as well, stereotypes who cling to the Christian answer a little too quickly to be realistic. One character, Hattie, seems to be written to garner sympathy, but only comes off as whiny and irritating.<br />I think if the writers had concentrated on story and not evangelism to their readers, we would have gotten a tighter, sensical book. If you want a good end of the world novel (and one that deals with redemption far more seriously than this) pick up 'The Stand' by Stephen King. Classic. When I want a story, I read a book. When I want a sermon, I'll go to church, thank you.	2001-04-20

Anderson fan by any stretch of the imagination (he's poisen to Star Wars, I tells ya) and I am a fan of the original Dune series (although not as hardcore as most). And with these two concepts colliding as I read &quot;House Atreides&quot;, a shocking fact unfolded like Paul's visions in the original book... I actually liked it.<br />I'm not one to tally up every detail in the original Herbert series, so theres no way possible I could criticize it for missing details. All I can say it was a good read. Unlike Frank Herbert, whose writing was intelligent and made you think, Anderson prefers rather to show everything, leaving nothing to the imagination. Every scene, action and battle is told in Anderson's quaint style. And I found nothing wrong with it. It was fun to get a look at the major characters seen a few decades before the original novel. <br />Just the same, I still prefer to view this work as a 'what if' type of Dune story, a glamourised look at the characters and locations Herbert created. Rather than an accurate prequal, I see 'House: Atreides' as an embellished history. But a fun sci-fi romp all the same.	2001-04-07

This first book collects all the major issues that deal with the characters origin; two Batman books and the first three issues of the Hitman series. Although his origin is a bit weak (he receieved telepahty and x-ray vision after being attacked by a demon...go figure) the story quickly skips passed it and gets to the heart of the action. Ennis' usual gallows humour is strongly evident (what happens at a mobsters funeral in the last few issues is hilarious) as is his penchant for nasty head wounds. Albeit, the violence is nowhere near that of the 'Preacher' - he had to tone it down for DC - the writing is strong and McCrea's artwork is great. A fun read from the Irish wonder writer.	2001-04-05

This collection also brings a close to one of the stories introduced in the first collection, as a mob boss (whose dead siamise twin's corpse decays on his bodies other half) sends a smooth assassin to deal with Tommy. All this, and a pretty funny jab at super-hero comics. '100,000 Bullets', an obvious play on Azzerello's '100 Bullets', is a fun read and a solid continuation of the 'Hitman' story.	2001-04-05

To be honest, I didn't even know it was part of a series when I picked it up. The beauty is, it didn't matter. 'Rumble Tumble' was a fun book with good characters that didn't need knowledge of a huge backstory. I enjoyed the main character of Hap the best. He's a good man who'll do whats right, but he's not necessarily a brave man. Writing such a macho, roughneck type book, it must be tempting to make the main character a one-dimensional badass, but the people who populate this story are truly interesting characters. Can't wait to read the other books in the series.	2001-03-31

I am not too sure whether I mean that as a compliment or a criticism. <br />The Black Company are a brotherhood of warrior mercenaries, roughneck soldiers who contract their services to whoever will pay. Whether for moral goals or not, if the money's there they'll do it. Croaker, the member of the Black Company who records their adventures, is the narrator. <br />I enjoyed the first-person perspective very much. It was enjoyable to hear Croaker's thoughts on what was going on around him. The story is far different than most typical fantasies as there are no distinct good or evil characters. Sure, there are some who pretty much meet the requirements of both, but nothing is very simple in this book. <br />I did not like, however, how the story was layed out. Rather than immersing the reader in the imaginary world, the reader is more or less tossed carelessely into the murkiness of the plot. You're introduced to far too many imaginary names, titles, monsters, etc early on in the book. I had to recheck whether I was reading the first book in the series or not. It just assumed I should know everything about the world I was reading about.  Also, characters fly by in such a whirlwind that it's hard to keep track of who is who. A couple of times a character would be killed off only to be replaced by another, but it would go by so fast that the event seemed inconsequential. Most characters just kinda faded into the background, with the exception of the ever-present Croaker and a few other extras. There wasn't anything about the people or events that hooked me into the story.<br />Overall, 'Black Company' was an okay read. It gave the feeling that something was going to happen soon, and I will definately read the next book. I just hope that when that's done, I will have a clearer picture of why I am actually continuing on.	2001-03-23

Miller writes 'Year One' the way Batman needs to be portrayed - gritty, dark and murky; all buzz-words that have become cliches for Millers work, and for the right reason. This is a crime story, true and simple. <br />Batman here is hardly the invincible super-hero steroetyped by our culture. Here he is just a man, one who's committed to the task of cleaning up Gotham City of the criminal element. He can be wounded, he can make mistakes, but he also gets the job done. The book also focuses on the young Jim Gordon, who would one day become Gotham's police commissioner and Batman's confidant. Here he's a young cop with all the failings and imperfections of a man striving to do whats right. Miller writes the dialogue with stark realism, and I felt like I was reading about true multi-dimensional characters.<br />With this book and his seminal 'Dark Knight Returns', Miller takes the icon of Batman out of the garish hands of the neon-lighted buffoonery of Hollywood and back into the shadowed streets where he was meant to be. Buy this book.	2001-03-13

When I first saw the cover to this book, I knew I would love this book. It's terrible to admit, but true. The pulp-styled artwork gave me the early impression that 'Dead in the West' would take a prominant place on my bookshelf... and whaddya know, it has.<br />'Dead in the West' is a fun horror western written by Joe Lansdale. A gunslingin' preacher rolls into the backwater town of Mud Creek, questioning his beliefs and indulging his desires. His personal problems take a backseat soon enough when the dead start waling the streets...and their darn hungry! <br />The book is one of those delightful pleasures I love to indulge - survival horror. I just love tales of hard-bitten heroes finding sanctuary and trying to stay alive as masses of evil try to take 'em down. 'Night of the Living Dead', 'Resident Evil' and 'From Dusk Till Dawn' (which I swear drew more than just a passing resemblance to this book) were all enjoyable exercises into that genre, and 'Dead in the West' joins their ranks.<br />Like the intro itself states, don't expect this to be Shakespeare. It's action through and through. I was a little disappointed in the size (about 100 pages, very small) but was glad by the end. Perfect size for a perfectly fun story.	2001-03-13

It goes deep into the inner workings of the ancient warrior class, shedding light on the fundementals and history. I enjoyed reading about the different martial arts that were integral for training, and also the chapters on weapons. The sections regarding Japaenese history were a little glossed over, and I thought more time could have been spent on, but overall a great resource.	2001-03-12

'The Last Guardian', sequel to the amazing 'Wolf in Shadow' is the latter; it doesn't quite better the first, but is an awesome story nonetheless.<br />Gemmell manages to take the character of the Jerusalem Man in a new direction, keeping true to the original source material but adding new details and nuances to the story. 'Last Guardian' does what many fail to do; keep the flavour of the original while expanding and adding to the mythos it created. <br />And like 'Wolf in Shadow', 'Guardian' bookends the amazing story with a creative knock-your-mental-socks off finale that will have you turning back pages just to relive the action. <br />Gemmell is a master storyteller and not only knows how to create characters, but guide them through his fantastic stories. Another near-perfect creation.	2001-03-09

I became an instant David Gemmell fan after reading the last book in his 'Stones of Power' series, and have not looked back since. Every single book he has written has more or less been fantastic. None however overshadow this classic book which I highly suggest to all who read this.<br />'Wolf in Shadow' takes place in the far-flung future where an accident has toppled the earth, nearly destroying life and turning most of the world into a wastland. It has also released the magical Sipstraasi stones back into the world. Civilisation has worked it's way up to horse and buggies, but there exists a great evil who has built a satanic army thirsting for dominance.<br />There also exists The Jerusalem Man, a noble gunslinger who walks the world searching for the city of the Bible. This is Jon Shannow, one of Gemmell's greatest creations. He is a good man, but a hardened violent one who's morality is edged with a murderous quickdraw. And when he meets with Abaddon, lord of Hell and the mysterious gaurdians of the Sipstraasi, it creates one of sci-fi's under-appreciated jewel's. <br />Gemmel, as he is known to do, writes a strong adventure book but lines it with deep philosophical debates on the nature of evil and morality, one of those rare books that'll keep you turning pages and thinking as well.<br />Just a great novel from a great writer.	2001-03-09

That's why it was a real pleasure to read Jane Jensen's 'Sins of the Fathers'.<br />Jensen, creator of the simply awesome 'Gabriel Knight' series of PC games, puts her video game characters to paper and does a fine job of it. Gabriel Knight, the roguish hero of this first book in the series, is written well and is a decently worked-out character. The supporting cast is also very likable, especially Knight's spunky assisten Grace Nakamura. <br />I don't, however, get the feeling that Jensen had a good grasp of writing a novel. Her storytelling gifts are evident in her games, but in the medium of novels the writing seemed a little juvinile, as if aimed at a much younger audience. If it didn't contain so much profanity (almost seemed to have been thrown in to 'adult' up the book) I'd probably suggest it for kids.<br />This criticism does not get in the way of the story, though. As said earlier, Jane does have a gift for storyteling and I am looking forward to reading her other books. This is a good read for those who enjoy the supernatural mixed in with a little treasure hunting.	2001-03-09

Congrats to whoever did the creepy skull cover-art, it really did the advertising trick. But the first book in the series is far from just a cool cover. It's an excellent story with some good main characters and a surprisingly deep scientific undertone for a horror novel.<br />The Necroscope is someone who can literally talk to the dead, learn the knowledge that they took to the grave and use it for their own purposes. The book's main characters are both Necroscopes. There's Dragosani, the Romanian secret agent who's working for a Russian agency which trains it's soldiers in the supernatural. Then there's Harry Keogh, a young boy who develops the talent naturally and becomes entangled in Dragosani's plot. Tying their destiny together is an ancient vampiric being trapped in the Transylvanian ground, who's powers for evil are unimaginable.<br />The plot in 'Necroscope' is indeed an interesting one. I found the idea of international supernatural espionage (or ESPionage) extremely fascinating and is really done well. The opening sequences were Dragosani's bosses witness his talent for the first time was truly gripping. And the characters were well thought out and developed. Each one's motivations are clearly laid out and we're given an inside look into each one's lives.<br />'Necroscope' is also a rejuvinating shot to the vampire genre. Lumley reworks the legends well, keeping to its classic nature but giving the mythos a refreshing twist as well. (to read an extremely awful vampire series try Christopher Golden's 'Shadow' series. Simply awful)<br />The only problem I had was the Mobius Continuum device that Lumley uses. It was a concept that came in near the end of the book and I thought felt out of place. It gave the book an unneeded metaphysical angle and seemed tacked on. I haven't read the other books, and I see it's a concept used again, so I'll have to continue the series to develop my feelings further about it.<br />All in all a very good book, a promising start to a classic series I am excited to be starting.er about it.<br />All in all a very good book, a promising start to a classic series I am excited to be starting.	2001-03-03
US	49890931	R1OSHS19T01YGT	0345417623	786105285	Timeline	Books	3	0	2	N	N	Fun ride, but no 'Jurassic Park'	Many people had suggested I read this book, and my anticipation level was high. And why not? I mean, I love a good time-travel tale. Nothing in sci-fi beats the time honoured motif of the ironic paradoxes one usually pulls off going back in time. Look at 'Terminator', or even 'Back to the Future's. Of course, I expected far more than these cartoonish stories had to offer. Crichton has always delivered great stories, big adventures partnered with heavy science. And although 'Timeline' isn't a bad book, for me it's not what I was expecting.<br />I was looking forward to all the quasi-realistic scientific jargon that Crichton always flavours his books with. The talk of actual cloning theories in 'Jurassic Park' really seasoned the otherwise fantastical elements with a tangebility, a feeling of &quot;wow, this could be really happening!&quot; In 'Timeline', all the time-travel theories are nothing more than a vehicle for getting the characters where the action happens. This altogether isn't a bad thing, but it all seemed kind of laboured.<br />There is the requisite Crichton scene where the really intelligent character briefs the dumb main characters about the theories that'll be major plot-devices later in the story. Then it's off to the past on a wild medieval romp that reminded me more of 'Army of Darkness' then it did 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court'. The theories presented just didn't feel that credible. The debates about them in the book didn't argue a good point regarding their findings on time-travel. It's not that I let something like that bother me, but with Crichton I kind of expected more.<br />Another problem was that not only is the book a time-travel adventure into the past, but a very typical time-travel adventure. Crichton's take on medieval culture isn't very novel. It's all very basic and stale. And the characters are one-dimensional cutouts, given their special talents early in the book (which of course conveniently serve them well on their trip) and are sent on their way.<br />Of course, if you can look past these criticisms, 'Timeline' is a good, fun read. Lot's of jousting hi-jinks and cliff-hangers to interest the reader who is looking for nothing more than a brainless Saturday afternoon read. In this respect, it is far more closer to the 'Jurassic Park' of film than it is to the novel.	2001-03-01
US	49890931	R22P2ZQ6RHVEKD	156389422X	715043122	Unknown Soldier	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Another Ennis masterpiece.	The more I read of Garth Ennis' work, the faster I become a disciple of the ever-growing fanclub of his. The Irish writed always manages to fuse fun, hyperviolent stories with a sense of morality and justice. Many may take a quick look and view his tales as extreme and indulgent, but underneath all the head wounds is a sense of duty and goodness. <br />'Unknown Soldier' focuses on the the quest of one man to find the identity of a mysterious US agent known only as the Unknown Soldier. Few now the truth, and those who do don't last too long. Who's covering the Soldier's identity, and why? <br />Garth pens another fun tale that borders more on the serious than his masterwork 'Preacher', which showcased his dark humour. Ennis delves into atrocities out of humankinds past, on both sides of the battlefield. The picture he paints is a world that is far too grey anymore to make a choice between right and wrong, but if one looks hard enough the choice is ultimately there.<br />Any problems a reader might encounter with this is the ending. I found it very satisfying, but many may not agree with the harsh closure it brings to the story. <br />Although I missed the artwork of Ennis' 'Preacher' partner Steve Dillon, Killian Plunkett adds dark realism to Ennis' story. Emotion is drawn so superbly that you truly sense the anger, disgust and betrayel portayed. And the addition of the original covers by Tim Bradstreet is a definate plus to picking up this book. <br />Not a story to ultimately display Garth Ennis' talents, it's still one that tells a good story, and any established fan cannot keep from their collection.	2001-03-01

I had read Williams' 'Dragonbone Chair' and was really looking forward to this 'cyberpunk' fantasy. Unfortunately 'Otherland's ridiculous immensity was too much to handle. Don't get me wrong, I love a good big book. King's 1100 page uncut version of 'The Stand' is fantastic, as are the Moorcock collections and other large, good books. 'Otherland', on the other hand, is not a good book. <br />There are literally hundreds of characters in this book alone (just the first in a long line of bricks...excuse me, books) and not an interesting one among them. The bushman character especially was a ridiculous addition to the story's population. And the five or so storylines that are plodding through the 1000+ pages are all dull and seemingly purposeless. To make matters worse for the reader, each one exhibits a radically different style and structure from the other ones, leaving the book directionless and unfocused. <br />This was a book that I would dread to read. Just seeing the big black and yellow block on my shelf made me cringe. I would have to take a break every 200 pages or so and read another book, but when i came back to 'Otherland' it's was almost like going to work. <br />The book probably would be pretty good if the author did some major editing to the content. Tad Williams is an excellent writer, and cutting some of the fat off would make a leaner, purposeful story. Instead we get a bloated, overweight tale of only God knows what.	2001-02-27

I have to say that Stackpole's contribution to the Star Wars universe, mainly the 'Rogue Squadron' books and comics, are some of the best material since Timothy Zahn's trilogy of books. <br />While other authors have seriously taken the SW universe off track, 'Rogue Squadron' has kept religiously to the source material of Lucas's films. Star Wars was never meant to be hard science-fiction or a political thriller as some of the more recent books have tried to be ('Black Fleet Crisis', the 'Coruscant' trilogy') it was meant to be a fun adventure set in space, and that's what Stackpole has created.<br />'Rogue Squadron' also manages to do something most other SW books haven't come close to - stay clear from the main characters and focus on the lesser known (outside of hardcore SW fans) ones, and create some great new ones as well. Stackpole manages to keep the action fastpaced and the story constantly moving. A great start to an awesome series.<br />If you're a SW fan already, you'll know what I mean. If you are an haven't read these yet, grab 'Rogue Squadron', the first in the 'X-Wing' series, and remember what it was like to love Star Wars.	2001-02-23

All I can say now is I am glad I only paid 8 bucks for my paperback of 'Darksaber'.<br />Now that he has some SW material behind him, I think it's safe to say that he was one of the most unoriginal hacks keeping the SW universe afloat. After reading (and rereading) other great authors contributions to the field (Stackpole's 'Rogue Squadron' and Zahn's integral books) I feel that Anderson is doing nothing more than holding the series back from reaching it's potential.<br />In 'Darksaber' we are greeted with another shot at keeping the Empire as the main baddies, another super-weapon that can destroy a planet in one shot (hey, super-weapons began and ended with the Death Stars) another visit to worn out locations, and another adventure which refuses to create any interesting new heroes. I mean, I love Luke and the gang, but having them save the universe every time is getting ridiculous. <br />Anderson seems to ignore every other authors contribution to SW with the exception of Lucas. Has he ever used any characters or locations from other authors? And I don't mean the cheesy cameo of Mara in the Jedi Academy books. I have to admit, he did show some major bravery for killing off a majore main character, but it seemed to be for nothing, a total waste.<br />Get this one to complete your library of SW material only.	2001-02-23
US	49890931	RCHQRSD4NJWOM	0671797972	557658136	Dead Sea Scrolls Deception	Books	2	84	110	N	N	Interesting, but no leg to stand on	I picked up &quot;Dead Sea Scrolls Deception&quot; in my quest to get all the contreversial works by Baigent, Leigh and the rest. I really enjoyed &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot; and &quot;The Stone and the Elixir&quot;, works that although I didn't wholly agree with, I still found intriguing and fascinating. This book, however, I found to be overbearing and overconfidant.<br />The &quot;Deception&quot; in question refers to a possible coverup of certain scrolls that were found at the site of Qumran. According to the authors, the scrolls that were publicly shown were only a small percent of the cache of artifacts found at the site. These were basically biblical texts, not too contreversial. The scrolls that were suppressed, however, apparantly held information that gave an alternative and groundshaking origin of Christianity.<br />Earth shattering? Hardly.<br />Some of the claims that the authors make here seem too far-fetched to have taken place. The early chapters dealing with the actual cover-up seemed to be taken from the script of a Hollywood suspense film. It just seemed too cut-and-dried. Of course, every agent of the Church is a stuck up evil fascist who would rather burn books than read them, while those who fight against the cover-up are faultless investigators struggling for the &quot;truth&quot;. I find it extremely hard to believe that biblical scholars up until the point of the publication of this book have been getting it all wrong, and it takes the handful of reasearchers in the book to find &quot;the hidden truth&quot;. <br />What bothers me the most is the lack of counter-arguments in the book. The authors gleefuly point out the mistakes of others when it serves their cause, but never seem to anticipate and thus tackle arguments against their findings. Just once I'd like to hear &quot;well, we did get these wrong, but know we have this to prove us right&quot;. Instead we're given pristine research and blemishless results.<br />Definately an interesting read, but I beg the authors not to make another &quot;earth-shattering&quot; claim without hiring at least more than one researcher next time.	2001-02-14

Unfortunately I missed some of the arcs by past writers, but I slipped into the current Azzarello run pretty easily with this paperback.<br />&quot;Hard Time&quot; is a pretty fun story. The whole prison motif intrigued me when I first heard about it, and I really enjoyed seeing the hardcore Constantine deal with it. Azzarello handles the story pretty well, and although it's far too early to judge his handling of the main character, &quot;Hard Time&quot; remains a good read. <br />Some of the story elements, though, seemed a tad cliched. The whole story seemed like an episode of Oz. I wasn't sure if he was paying homage or blatantly stealing. <br />Those who're already fans of the series and missed this arc should pick it up, but if you're new to Hellblazer, start off with &quot;Original Sins&quot;. It's a great way to be introduced to the series.	2001-02-11

The pseudo-historical/quasi-anti-religious series of novels that seem to appear every few months are such a treat. Not because they offer waterproof arguments, but because they're so much fun, kinda like reading Hardy Boys mysteries. But where other such books were a pleasure, 'Hiram Key' is a travesty. 'Hiram Key' is another cookie-cutter book in a long line of books which try to present a fascinating -yet unrealistic- look into the super-secret world of the Masonic Order. Interestingly enough, about a quarter of the book concentrates on this subject. The other 75% wastes its time trying to shock its audience with &quot;proof&quot; meant to discredit Christianity. Been there, read that.<br />The authors cannot come up with a plausable theory to save their lives. Such reasoning by the &quot;detectives&quot; is as follows: Let's say that God rested on the 7th day. Well, what if you replaced the word 'rested' with the words 'had a barbecue'. Therefore, as the reasoning goes, On the 7th day God had a barbecue. THEREOFORE the Bible is all wrong and Chrsitianity is a sham.<br />I swear. That's exactly how they come to their conclusions. The book is peppered with such brilliance.<br />It's not that I'm laughing at the various theories presented in this book (okay, maybe I am) but the fact that this is nothing more than a mish-mashed collection of other &quot;heresies&quot; and research done by more able, creative authors. Don't believe me? Check out the author's bio's in the book and compare them to other the likes of Micheal Baigent and Henry Lincoln (of the much more creative and enjoyable 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail')<br />The last chuckle is reserved for the fact that this book which &quot;will shock the world&quot; and threatened to &quot;bring Christianity to it's knees&quot; is usually found either as a tattered lone copy mistakenly placed in the Religion section, or in the bargain book shelf. If you wanna laugh, pick this gem up.	2001-02-08

Being a huge fan of the film 'Silence of the Lambs', I quickly ran out and bought all 3 Lector books, and even bought the film 'Manhunter'. Boy, did I set myself up for a fall.<br />While 'Red Dragon' and 'SOTL' were suspenseful serial-killer hunts, 'Hannibal' is nothing more than a convoluted soap opera. The story opened up with great promise. I pretty much enjoyed all until the last half of the book, especially Lector's time in Italy (I truly loved the confrontation between him and Pazzi) but the over-indulged Verger family/italian mafia story began to bog the book down for me. 'Dragon' and 'Lambs' concentrated more on the brilliantly drawn main characters, with the secondary characters adding some dimension. 'Hannibal', on the other hand, expands pointlessly on characters that I felt didn't need to be there in the first place. I mean, c'mon, orderly Barney? He hung in there till the 'fricken epilogue! And the whole Verger sister side-story left me shaking my head. Sure, I can see why she was important for the story in the end. I also can see how she was important as filler, making a more larger, attractive book for the shelves.<br />As for the ending, many may have found it &quot;challenging&quot; or &quot;such a twist&quot;. I found it irritating and ridiculous. SPOILER, but I can't twist the character of Starling that I followed in 'Lambs' to the confusingly pathetic puppet we see in the endpages here. As a different actress replaces the original Clarice in the film, I find myself replacing the character in the book with another of the same name.<br />All in all, great start but serious wobbling to the end.	2001-02-02
