This book goes into much greater detail and merits a gradual reading by non-scientists like myself. The Preface is a clear introduction to the issues. The next section, Overture, is intentionally overwhelming with its \\"Greatest Story Ever Told.\\" If you are not frustrated by this chapter, you know a lot more about physics than I do! Ah, but that is the point. Hang in there, because the rest of the book explains the Overture, one topic at a time. I am reading part of a chapter each day at lunch and find something amazing each day. This is a good book for people who want to challenge their assumptions about reality.	2004-10-29

This book changed the entire nature of the discussion. If rape is a crime of power, then it has very little to do with female seduction or with healthy male appetites. <BR>The book is still very relevant, in part because the old myths are still very strong in many parts of the world, helping to hold women as virtual prisoners in their own home countries.<BR>This is not a textbook for social scientists; it is a primer on the real nature of rape.	2003-07-19

Fortunately, the good guys have won some striking victories(at least temporarily), and this beautifully illustrated volume tells some of the details.     There are seven chapters, each focused on a specific region or issue.    Chapter One covers Mineral King valley (California)and the birth of the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund whose landmark Supreme Court case protected this part of Sequoia National Park from a massive development proposed by the Walt Disney corporation.    Chapter Two is about Admiralty Island (Alaska).    Chapter Three describes the politics of energy on the Colorado Plateau, including several national parks in Utah.    Chapter Four covers Redwood National Park (California).    Endangered species are the focus of Chapter Five. It ranges over a wide geographic area including pigeon guillemots in California, Palilas in Hawaii, Murres in the Falloron Islands, dusky dolphins off the coast of Patagonia, humpbacked whales in Alaska, red-cockaded woodpeckers in southeastern forests and the famous northern spotted owl of the Pacific Northwest.    Chapter Six describes legal battles in the Northern Rockies, including clashes with James Watt, Ronald Reagan's choice for Secretary of the Interior.    Chapter Seven includes four battles in the Eastern United States: Lake George (New York), Big Cypress and the Everglades (Florida), Hoosier National Forest (Indiana), and Canaan Valley (West Virginia).    This book is a great gift for anyone who is interested in the preservation of wild places.	2003-03-02

The Search Conference is a very specific way to plan change. It brings together a cross-section about 25 to 40 people from inside the  organization (or community) for an intense two-night, three-day meeting,  usually in a remote setting.<br />Fred Emery, who wrote the epilogue, is best  known as the Australian who helped pioneer the concept of self-managed work  teams in the 1950s and 1960s. His wife Merrelyn is a co-author of the  book.<br />I have used a Search Conference to help a major food manufacturer  optimize its supply chain. Governor Roy Romer of Colorado used the  technique to help resolve a regional conflict over water resources, and  Microsoft used it for planning in a very creative product development  group.<br />This approach is especially well-suited to more introverted,  analytical types of people (engineers, software developers, etc.)<br />For  those who have strong experience as facilitators of interactive meetings,  this book is all you need to plan a good conference. If in doubt, it would  be a good idea to use an outside resource, because this is far different  than the typical conference where people stand up and give speeches.<br />The  book tells you what to do and why to do it. <br />For larger groups (up to  1,000 or more) it would be advisable to use a technique like Real Time  Strategic Change. For more creative groups, a Future Search might make more  sense.	2000-06-29

The meetings usually require a single bloc of  three days and two nights.<br />The underlying theory is that people support  changes that they help to plan. Processes such Future Search or Search  Conference can be used by smaller groups (usually 15 to 65 people) to  develop an initial plan. RTSC can bring that plan to an entire company for  refinement and implementation planning.<br />Ford Motor Company's Mustang  division used a version of RTSC to introduce total quality management in  the 1980s, responding to the challenge of Japanese automobiles.<br />Generally  speaking, RTSC involves the &quot;whole system&quot; - everyone who is  involved in the development of a product or service as well as the  customers who buy it. In the food industry, for example, an RTSC conference  would include suppliers of raw materials and grocery retailers as well  internal groups such as Logistics, Manufacturing, Sales, etc. Suppliers and  customers can provide information on how the company stacks up compared  with competitors, often by using a panel discussion format.  Industry  experts may also provide information on key trends.<br />Work is done in a  combination of large and small group settings. In the large-group sessions,  people are assigned to sit at round tables of eight to ten people. These  are &quot;max-mix&quot; groups representing different departments or  organizations. Following various presentations, the groups are asked to  discuss what happened and formulate a brief response. This helps keep the  meetings lively and creative.<br />In the classic RTSC format, senior managers  present an overview of their proposed plan to the entire group. After small  group discussions, people use post-its to write what they agree with, what  they disagree with, and what questions they have. The managers have a full  night to review this feedback. They return the next day to answer the  questions, reinforce areas of agreement, and respond to areas of  disagreement. This can be a lively event!<br />People then move into  implementation groups to write more detailed action plans to help  kick-start the change process.<br />The large groups generate a great deal of  energy, an important factor in successful change.<br />While Jacobs provides a  good overview for agenda development, he has little to say about the very  important logistics of a meeting like this. Important topics include  meeting site selection, room size, room arrangement, methods for sharing  information, and audio-visuals. When I facilitated an RTSC conference, I  hired someone to manage a team of 10 people devoted to conference  logistics. While some practitioners have published handbooks on this topic,  I don't see any that are widely available. So that is a hole in Jacobs'  book.	2000-06-29

This book was written in the early  1950s, and two signs of age were apparent. First, Stegner had not seen many  of the river sections he describes, including the Grand Canyon of the  Colorado and the Desolation-Grey Canyons section of the Green. The boom in  commercial river running now makes many of us more expert than Stegner on  that subject - kind of fun! Second, and less fun, the old boy has many  subtle ways of downplaying the importance of women in the story. Small  example: Stegner names Powell's brothers but only mentions the number of  sisters, even though their roles in the story all quite small. These are  nits born of his times.

The price alone tells you that. But if you are a policy maker or an environmentalist interested in a success story, it could be a great investment. It is the tale of how one river  remained damless, despite an authorized Army Corps of Engineers project. I  liked the book because I am a canoer who has paddled the Delaware and a  river activist who can use lots of tips.<br />The author, Richard Albert,  provides an insider's perspective. Most recently, he was a supervising  engineer and basin planner for the Delaware River Basin Commission. He's  been involved in river studies for three decades.<br />The Delaware is a  fairly small river, draining only four-tenths of one percent of the  continental U.S. Yet almost ten percent of the nation's population relies  on its basin for water, and Delaware Bay is within a day's drive of about  40 percent of the entire U.S. population. Various groups have wanted dams  on the Delaware to provide water, electrical power and flood control. As  Albert explains, no dams have been built because New York City, New York  State, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware could never fully agree on a  project. At the top end of the river, New York City wants to protect its  drinking water supply, which is based on huge reservoirs near the  headwaters of the Delaware in upstate New York. At the bottom end,  fishermen and others want to assure clean, regular water flow, something  that could be diminished by one or more dams. In between, there are many  opinions about the potential impact of one or more dams on the  river.<br />Albert provides a long historical perspective, beginning in the  colonial era, when navigation was the primary use of the river. States  along the river agreed to prohibit dams, and this perspective ruled until  the early twentieth century. Water supply, hydrological power, flood  control and recreation became important issues in the twentieth century,  and Albert gives them detailed treatment.<br />His description of the 1960s  and 1970s includes some bizarre twists to the story. Two examples stand out  for me.  First, there's eutrophication. That's the overproduction of algae  and plants caused by too much phosphorus or nitrogen in water. It stinks,  too. Environmental studies suggested that the large number of poultry farms  upstream of the proposed Tock's Island Dam would turn the new reservoir  into &quot;one gigantic cesspool.&quot; I call this segment of the story,  &quot;How Chicken Poop Saved the Delaware.&quot; Second, the whole land  acquisition process went sour. The Corps of Engineers began acquiring land  for a huge National Recreation Area above and below the Delaware Water Gap  in 1964. By 1970 the project was still on hold, and &quot;hippy&quot;  squatters began settling on the new public lands. Local residents were  already concerned about the impact of tens of thousands of visitors on  their roads, water supply, power supply, etc., and they were none too happy  to see Haight-Ashbury move its act into rural New Jersey. In the end,  unpaid local activists played an important role in helping to achieve the  1982 &quot;Good Faith Agreement&quot; among the mayor of New York and the  governors of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware. Everyone  agreed to leave the river free-running until after the year 2000 - and then  reconsider the dam as a water supply source.<br />A friend and I canoed from  Port Jervis, New York to the Delaware Water Gap in August 1999, and we  camped right where the dam was proposed. Those who want to enjoy the  Delaware as a free-flowing river after 2001 might want to pick up a copy of  this book.	2000-06-14

I have too many \\"500 tips\\" books about customers and not enough like this one! Achieving Customer Delight gives an individual or a group a disciplined process for really transforming the way they do business, and  it is in very plain English. I would recommend it for executive directors,  fund raisers and staff or volunteer teams. It would be an interesting tool  for a new ED to use in diagnosing an organization, too. The worksheets are  easy to use, and you could go through the whole thing in a retreat or do  sections as staff development (probably 1-4 hours) in the office. It's a  great discussion starter. How many organizations could say \\"yes\\"  to the first item on the first worksheet:\\"This organization is focused  externally?\\" Way too few, and this book could help turn that focus  away from internal wrangling to a focus on the mission.
