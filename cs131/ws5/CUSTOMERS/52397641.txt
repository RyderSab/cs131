Pricey, pampered slaves or captives will be sacrificed to nourish the war god, and those lucky enough to be allowed to sponsor a sacrifice are dressed up in their showiest cloaks, jade nose plugs and ear studs. They follow the slaves up the pyramid, boosting their courage by chatting about what fabulous eternities the victims will enjoy post-sacrifice. <br /> <br />Yaotl, slave to a chief minister, has the job of escorting a sacrifice up the pyramid-an ordinary enough task for someone who used to be a priest--but the fellow he's escorting is acting a little strange. The day gets worse when the victim pre-sacrifices by jumping off the pyramid after shouting for everyone to look for the big boat. Yaotl is blamed for the disgrace and is charged with finding out what the suicide and warning were about. <br /> <br />Where the Aztec world in Gary Jennings' \\"Aztec\\" was a strange as science fiction, \\"Demon\\" author Simon Levack expresses Yaotl's society with a naturalness reminiscent of Mary Renault and Steven Saylor. What Aztecs ate, wore, thought, played, and prayed are nicely built into the narrative, and for the most part he avoids the jokiness that mars too many mysteries set in the ancient world (perhaps there is something intrinsically less funny about a society based on human sacrifice and ceremonial cannibalism). The opening sacrifice scene is a fine example of black humor, but then the Aztecs saw nothing extraordinary about sacrifice days, and, well, some just went better than others.  <br /> <br />This is the first in a planned series featuring Yaotl, and it will be interesting to see how Levack handles the approach of the Spanish conquistadors whose arrival is already sensed across the Aztec empire. This gives a nice little undercurrent of tension to everything in the story, and it's a smart move to choose a time period with built-in suspense. I presume it was a conscious decision-a lot about the novel seems consciously selected to sustain a series-but still, it is interesting, it is different, and \\"Demon of the Air\\" is a good read. <br />	2005-09-30

James as a writer of top psychological thrillers. Many of her earlier works were rooted in the supernatural (\\"Strange Meeting\\" is one of the most haunting books I've ever read) and while \\"Haunts\\" stays mostly on solid ground, be aware that you have entered a world where protagonists may be guilty, or die, or the crime may never be solved or even discovered. The unwritten contract most readers make with mysteries was never signed by Susan Hill, and thank God for it. No one should ever expect to trust certain characters or expect a resolution-not in a mystery and certainly not in one by Susan Hill.<br /><br />In this novel she introduces DCI Simon Serrailler, a detective from a family where everyone in the family has been doctors for generations; a gifted artist; and a handsome man who attracts women but is strangely repellent. Hill adds a number of characters connected to his twin sister Dr. Cat Deerbon, and through her, to the crime. These characters are so fully developed that each is worthy of their own book and you will become attached to them. You may figure out who the serial killer is, but you will not be able to guess what that person will do next or why he chose this small town to do it in.<br /><br /> I'll let you discover the plot of \\"The Various Haunts of Men.\\"  This is an engrossing read and one that promises a terrific series. It is nice to see rules broken and stakes changed in a genre that has become rather predictable. If you like to know what's what in your mysteries, then this book will drive you crazy. If you like an edge, read on.	2005-09-09

Surprised that I had missed something that sounded so good, I made sure to pick Margaret Elphinstone's novel up on a Canadian vacation. I was not disappointed. This is a fine historical novel that looks at an unusual period of history from an unusual point of view in clear, compelling language.  <br /> <br />The novel is set along the U.S./Canadian border in the early 19th century, before Canada was unified and at a time that the young U.S. was testing its power as a nation. An English Quaker named Mark Greenhow arrives to search for his younger sister Rachel, who came to Canada as a missionary, married a Scottish fur trader, and vanished into the wilderness. Mark is strong in his faith and determined to bring home to his grieving parents the truth of what happened to their daughter even though her marriage to a non-Quaker caused her to be disowned by her order. The search takes two years through a wilderness on the edge of a war over its resources, and Mark and his faith will be truly tested. Can--or should--he hold to his pacifist beliefs when others see war as the best choice?  <br /> <br />The book takes the form of Mark's journal as rewritten by himself many years after his journey. The pretext is that the journal is discovered by the modern-day purchaser of the Greenhow's farm--a device which is awkward and unnecessary enough to cost the novel half a star. Still, \\"Voyageurs\\" is very satisfying, with meticulously developed characters and a rich sense of time and place, highly recommended for readers who crave adventure with substance and history with a beating heart. I have another Margaret Elphinstone novel by my bedside, ready to go. Reviewers at the Monitor were right on.	2005-08-18

Or actually, rather like Freddy, the Prince of Wales and one of most misunderstood souls to ever stagger through the international spotlight. Freddy is an intelligent, thoughtful fellow, in grand physical shape with the best possible intentions who nonetheless manages repeatedly to make such a total idiot of himself in public that many--including those in his own family-are beginning to fear mental illness. Freddy is married to the beautiful Fredericka, who, we see, will be showered with accolades no matter what balderdash she utters. She and Freddy like each other, although he is involved in a thermonuclear affair with Lady Phoebe Boylingehotte and she with, well, others. <br /> <br />With the British monarchy in such jeopardy, a wizard appears to order Freddy and Fredericka on a quest to reconquor the United States, thus to prove their worthiness for the throne.  Bearing capsules up their woo-woos with Alabama driver's licenses that identify them as Desi and Popeel Moffat (but wearing no clothing) the Prince and Princess parachute into Bayonne, New Jersey, ready to win the US back for the UK. <br /> <br />Mark Helprin's new novel is very funny, and it is easy to forgive him if it goes on a little long. Freddy and Fredericka will call upon the resources bred into them by generations of nobility as they cheerfully tackle one challenge after another, beset by such individuals as British newspaper publisher Lord Faintingchair, the Gypsy king Kitten the Tenth, and US Presidential candidate Dewey Knott. The names may have a Dickensian flavor but much of the dialogue smacks more of Monty Python and Abbott and Costello (the Desi and Popeel have such tortured accents that strange misunderstandings often ensue). You're left feeling that it's a shame the Royal family has so few opportunities to show what they're really made of. You will laugh out loud. This funnybook is highly recommended. <br />	2005-07-22

This guy is good. <br /> <br />And so is this story. Set in 1920's Bogota, Wenceslao Hoyos and Lucho Reyes are two young men who are made for each other. Their families are unconcerned about the lads' sexual orientation as long as they do not become involved with Liberals, as their families are Conservative. No problem there. Educated, erudite, and fun-loving, Wen and Lucho enjoy the arts and lots of cafe chat with their friends and family. Their cheerful and unfocused lives take on new meaning when Wen's real obsession, the Italian actress Elenora Duse, comes to Havana on her farewell tour. They will travel to Cuba to interview her, she, who never gives interviews! As they prepare to leave, Lucho's family reveals a mysterious note from a lost uncle in Havana that requires immediate family attention. Little do the boys know that murder and mystery will follow.  <br /> <br />In contrast to these wealthy young men, Rodriguez presents Isadora Duse at the end of her long career, musing over a lifetime spent in the theater. Her naturalistic style inspired some of the great playwrights and revolutionized acting technique, but her gift has given her little joy. We see the drudgery of humping entire productions around the world, the touchy co-workers, the fawning public, the missing crates of scenery, the exhaustion of it all. It seems very unlikely that Duse will give these ardent, big-hearted admirers the time of day. <br /> <br />The Bogota scenes of \\"Masquerade\\" are especially appealing. We forget what small gems the capitals of Latin America once were, how deeply conservative yet free-thinking in surprising ways. Havana at any era is better known, but the reaction to it by two young men from a less free-wheeling capital is not. And then there is Duse, an artist adored by millions who have never seen her. Could anyone meet the expectations of a public teased to near-fanaticism by the press, especially when her work is so natural, so un-showy? This novel is a charming and literate valentine to a rare time and place.  <br />	2005-07-13

Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called \\"father of the atomic bomb.\\" She thinks of it another sign of her disrupted sleep patterns, but this is before an armed man comes into the library and begins shooting it up. Before he is killed by one of his own ricocheting bullets, he tells Ann that \\"the old ones are coming.\\"  <br /> <br />Shaken, Ann goes to a friend's restaurant for a drink. Next to her at the bar is a man reading a biography of Oppenheimer who looks just like the Oppenheimer in her dream. He is joined by an elfin man speaking Italian. They talk about what will happen to them in the future. The Italian, now speaking accented English, will die in 1954. The tall, skinny Oppenheimer-type, will live until 1967, and they will both die of cancer. They joke about this uneasily, and then leave.  <br /> <br />They are not alone. In author Lydia Millet's vision, both Oppenheimer and the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi disappeared from the Trinity nuclear testing site at the moment the test bomb went off, and reappeared in Santa Fe on March 1, 2003. In Chicago, a fat rude dynamo named Leo Szilard awakes under a table in the undergrad dining room at the University of Chicago at the same moment.  Szilard and his buddy Albert Einstein had written a letter to President Roosevelt in 1939 warning him about German research into an atomic weapon, thus starting the race for the bomb. Szilard, as brilliant as he is exasperating, puts two and two together faster than the other physicists and hops a bus for New Mexico; the train is too expensive for his 1945 dollars.  <br /> <br />Ann is already fascinated by the three, and before long the scientists are living at her house, smoking, surfing the Web, and inhailing donuts, barely tolerated by her tolerant husband. The scientists have been researching what happened post-Trinity. They need to see it for themselves. What ensues is part personal revelation andpart world circus as the scientists and a growing number of acolytes take what they've learned and head for Washington. <br /> <br />Millet's graceful writing and wry humor bring her story exploding to life. Those iconic men of science Fermi, Oppenheimer, and Szilard are rendered human and are no less brilliant for their frailty and quirkiness. If the detonation of the atomic bomb brought forth Godzilla, couldn't it also propel its very creators into another time zone? She informs, teases, moves, and enchants her readers with this masterful work of imagination and heart. This novel is terrific reading and shoud not be missed. <br />	2005-07-01

He takes the root of the problem back to the Maya, Aztecs, and Incas, when the sacred nature of authority was first instilled in the population. People existed not as individuals, but as members of social strata with specific functions, with the number one function of everything being to support the group on top. This fit in perfectly with the kind of top-down hierarchy practiced by Iberian colonizers.  Independence and revolution put governments in charge, with peasants working land that now belonged to their government as opposed to a big landowner. In one way or another, the state kept its fingers in every possible pie while the majority of the population remained infantilized, expecting the government provide for them, to be the biggest patrn of all. <br /> <br />What a relief not to have all the region's woes blamed on Spanish or Portuguese colonizers, and to recognize that many of the practices that still hold Latin America back were institutionalized long before Cortez dropped anchor. But while Vargas Llosa's analysis is intelligent and thought-provoking, his recommendations for reform don't fit with what he's just said. We've read how the population has been conditioned to expect a higher authority-God or the government-to take care of everything. People who feel they have no power are not going to know what to do with school vouchers or how to apply for credit when their squatter communities are granted legal status-two of his recommendations. Have school vouchers actually worked anywhere?   So much wealth is concentrated in so few hands in the region that it is hard to imagine that the oligarchs will voluntarily give any of it up, and we've seen that revolution doesn't work, and outside prodding backfires . . .Even after reading Vargas Llosa's intelligent work, liberty for Latin America still seems a long way off. <br />	2005-05-16

For the man who wrote such sublimely atmospheric books as \\"The Good German\\" and \\"Los Alamos,\\" \\"Alibi\\" is a colorless dud. <br /> <br />The choice of location and period are intriguing--Venice immediately following WWII. Unlike so much of Italy, Venice was physically untouched by the war and so retains its beauty as if nothing had ever happened. But of course, a great deal did happen as Adam Miller discovers when he meets Claudia Grassini, a Jewish survivor of the war. Adam's widowed mother has moved to Venice where she has rekindled a relationship with Gianni Maglione, a pre-war suitor. Claudia tells Adam that Maglione is a former Nazi sympathizer, which he accepts.  <br /> <br />How much more interesting it would have been if Adam had been wrong about Maglione! But he isn't, and between the uninteresting characters and spongy plot, \\"Alibi\\" bobs briefly before sinking into a canal. <br /> <br />If you haven't read Kanon's earlier period thrillers, go get them.

The du Plessix in Francine's name comes from her birth father, a hero of the French Resistance who died early in World War II. Although he never adopted her, Alex Liberman was the father she knew and loved, the man she and her mother always saw as the one who rescued them from the horrors of war. Tatiana had already fled one revolution, leaving Russia to live in Paris as a teenager with her grandmother, aunt, and uncle. In her early 20s, she met the dynamic Russian revolutionary poet and playwright Vladimir Mayakovsky during one of his visits to France. He wrote one of his most beautiful poems to her and begged her to return to Russia with him. But her fear was too great, and she married diplomat Bertrand du Plessix before Mayakovsky could return to again persuade her. Mayakovsky had been under growing scrutiny for his criticism of increasing oppression in the new Soviet Union, and he committed suicide shortly thereafter. His letters were one of the Tatiana's most carefully guarded items when she fled Europe.  <br /> <br />Photos from the family's arrival in New York make them look like a tight-knit trio, but Tatiana and Alex were terrible parents. They shuttled off Froshka, as they called her, with all sorts of extraneous family and friends. A friend had to tell her that her father was dead. They failed to tell her when they got married. They were as ambitious and thoughtless as two people can be. Butthey loved her very much. <br /> <br />What makes this memoirs so remarkable is how warmly du Plessix Gray writes about all this. She does not see herself as a victim, which is probably why she has a close and healthy family life as an adult. Beautiful writing, fearlessness, and compassion make this a memoir that will hold readers captive from start to finish. <br />	2005-05-13

By clarity I mean that, yes, everything is murky and underhanded and, no, nothing is what it seems, but he avoids that pointless \\"plot and counterplot\\" spy-writer fixation that makes me throw too many thrillers down in despair muttering, \\"who cares?\\" By appeal, Littell offers twisty, complex plots, interesting characters, and enough moral ambiguity to keep you happily hooked. <br /> <br />In the case of \\"Legends,\\" Martin Udom if a former CIA field agent who has had so many identities (or legends, as they're called in the business) that he's not sure who he is. He thinks Udom is his real self-that is, the person he was before he joined the CIA and became many other people-but in his new job as an unsuccessful private detective, he is receiving internal and external flashes indicating that Martin Udom may in fact be a legend, and that his real identity may be as someone he thought was a legend. The man is in psychic crisis, but he takes on the case of a Russian woman who wants him to find her brother-in-law so he can grant her sister a divorce. This search will initiate a number of near misses with people and information he thinks he would like to forget.  He's pulled to regions that featured in his spy-life which brings him closer to complete disorientation. Was he chosen by the CIA because he had multiple personalities, or because he had none at all? <br /> <br />Littell's \\"The Company\\" was a huge historical spy piece which looked at the positive and negative impact of CIA activity from the organization's inception. \\"Legends\\" narrows that focus to the effect on individuals, one in particular, while keeping up the expected pace.

The novel opens with pomp and splendor, as dignitaries and international celebs gather at the opening of an exhibit called \\"All Fired Up!\\" which is supposed to win the institution much needed-funding via the splashy presentation of a priceless Chinese porcelain bowl to the museum. But, oops!, the little bowl takes a fatal bounce down the entire front stairway, thanks not to some clumsy oaf of a guest, but to the museum's own curator of Chinese ceramics who for some reason decided to pick the thing up. What's an acting museum director to do? <br /> <br />That's one of the challenges facing Promise Whittaker, a tiny, brilliant scholar who looks and sounds like an eighth-grader, but whose common sense has put her in this fix. Promise would much rather be researching her beloved poet Rumi than being responsible for trying to attract enough funding to keep the museum open. Her mentor has suddenly decamped to join a dig in an especially remote desert. Her colleagues are up to all sorts of mischief, and oh, she's pregnant again at 42.  <br /> <br />Zuraleff is a former staff member at the Smithsonian, and you get a great idea about what goes on behind the scenes in putting an exhibit together.  There is neatly presented information about Rumi and different areas of Asian art. You even find out what to do if you are taken hostage by terrorists, thanks to Promise's husband, who works for Amnesty International. <br /> <br />Yet even with the wealth of characters (my favorite is the curator of ancient Chinese art who is looting her travel fund to pay for fertility treatments), \\"The Bowl is Already Broken\\" -like poor Promise-starts to tangle its own feet. The hostage-taking episode, despite that useful escape information, is not really very gripping, and you are left wondering what several of the characters were actually up to.  <br /> <br />Nevertheless, Zuraleff's novel is quirky and readable enough to keep you going if you can flutter lightly over some of the stumbles. Where else can you find a compendium of famous museums' worst disasters? And who hasn't wanted to work at a museum? I suspect her first novel is worth checking out, too. <br />	2005-04-12

With so many nationalities represented in the US, it is hard for us to understand what a shocking event the birth of multicultural England was.  <br /> <br />Andrea Levy 's novel begins in 1948 with a young Jamaican woman named Hortense Roberts arriving in England to join her husband. Nothing is working out right. He does not meet her at the boat, and when she does find him, he is living in a squalid room rented from an Englishwoman named Queenie Bligh. Hortense's new husband, Gilbert, served in the RAF and, like Hortense, always saw England as the Mother Country. Gilbert's experience in the service prepared him somewhat for British reaction to black immigrants, but in his heart he expected them to be grateful for Jamaican service in the war and for the fact that West Indians were coming to England because they were told they were needed.  <br /> <br />It is hard to imagine that so recently England was a completely white country. People there do not know what to make of the West Indians, who are equally shocked to find England cold, gray, tasteless, and bad-mannered. They are surprised to see how different white people can look-they all seem to be sweaty and red-faced in Jamaica-and that whites have never seen a black person before. From the start, this is going to be a difficult transition. <br /> <br />Levy winds her tale around Hortense, Gilbert, Queenie, their landlady, and her husband Bernard. We learn about their pasts, and how they are getting by in the hard present of post-war London. Each voice is distinct, each story equally involving. Post-war England is evoked in all its rubble and rationing, and we are left with the sense that the Jamaicans are the lucky ones-they could, conceivably, go back to their small island. The British, on the other hand, have nowhere else to go but theirs.  <br /> <br />\\"SmallIsland\\" deserves its prizes, and is so good I'm surprised it didn't win the Booker as well. Now, excuse me, I have to start looking for Andrea Levy's other novels. <br />	2005-03-25

The book's subtitle is \\"Solving the Mystery of a Strange and Dangerous Life,\\" but fortunately much of the subject's life remains tantalizingly unexplained. Author Tom Riess does a masterly job following Lev's trail, but how nice it is to know that even with the marvels of the internet, the hard work of a very dedicated writer, and the discovery of deathbed papers, so many details of a life lived completely in the 20th century and in the spotlight on several continents can remain a mystery. <br /> <br />So who is this book about? As Kurban Said, he was perhaps the author of \\"Ali and Nino,\\" the story of love between a Muslim boy and a Christian girl set in the central Asian city of Baku just before the Russian Revolution. It has never been out of print since its publication in the 1930s and remains very popular in any number of languages. As Essad Bey he was the author of biographies of Stalin and Nicholas II and a book on the Azerbaijani oil industry. He was invited to be Mussolini's official biographer. His socialite wife claimed not to know who he really was, and their divorce made the tabloids. As Lev Nussimbaum he spent his life fleeing one hideous revolution after another, but still managed to die of natural causes. You couldn't make this stuff up.  <br /> <br />Reiss is a fluid, vivid writer who captures the mystery, excitement, and plain oddness of this subject's life. He places Lev's story (he calls his subject Lev) brilliantly within its historic context, and his depiction of the Russian revolution in central Asia is terrific. This author is a guy who jumped at every chance to sift though trunks of crumbling correspondence ignored for decades in the storage rooms of country houses, and, in one case, willingly sang selections from popular musicals for an ancient aristocrat who allowed him to look through stacks of her family's letters. If anyone is up to recording Lev's amazing life, Tom Reiss is it.  <br /> <br />I was sorry when \\"The Orientalist\\" ended. I look forward to whatever mystery Tom Reiss takes on next. <br />	2005-03-01

Narrator Michael Smolij's family is part of a close-knit blue collar Detroit suburb, where nearly all the fathers work in local factories. As these jobs vanish through downsizing and outsourcing, so do the dads also begin to disappear. One leaves a note: \\"Gone to the moon.\\" The parish priest joins the exodus. The local bar starts serving the fourteen-year-olds who've had to step into their fathers' shoes. Mothers start working two or three jobs. Instead of growing into the good-paying factory positions their fathers' held, the kids take the only jobs available; working at the mall for $6 an hour.  <br /> <br />Michael's family is a little better educated than some of the neighbors and he aspires to college, taking community college classes while working in the mall bookstore. His cousin and best friend move into their twenties working at mall food court jobs meant for high school kids, trying their hands at any kind of entrepreneurial enterprise that will bring in a little money. They forge new families, but as they struggle to realize a slice of the American dream they always expected to be theirs, the sons of the vanished fathers are overcome by a strange restlessness, and Michael fears that they, too, will abandon their families, leaving their own children with even less to hope for than they had. <br /> <br />Bakopolus infuses a touch of magic into the grit of the story with excellent effect. Where did the fathers go? No amount of detective work turns up any of them. Realizing that there was no dignified place for them in the post-industrial economy, perhaps they really did go to the moon.  This is an auspicious debut from a writer who has a great deal to say and the skill to tell it well. I look forward to his next novel.  <br />	2005-01-28

Australian author Elliot Perlman has chosen to tell his story from seven different points of view-not a new idea, but one that seems completely fresh and surprising in Perlman's hands. The characters he chooses as his narrators and the voices he gives them are what propels \\"Seven Types\\" ahead to an end that comes all too soon for the besotted reader. The publisher's tag line deeming this \\"an epic novel about obsessive love in an age of obsessive materialism\\" does not do it any sort of justice. This novel is about much more than that and should not be missed.	2005-01-03

Okay so it's not \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\"-what is?  This book goes down very easy, but take a minute to think about what goes on at Dupont University and you'll probably find \\"Charlotte\\" is a pretty disturbing book. <br /> <br />You have to like Charlotte Simmons. Here she is, a girl from a rural high school, the success, the striver. With her grades, scores, and drive, she gets into all the top colleges in the country but chooses Dupont, the place she feels she will find her intellectual equals. This is not what Charlotte finds.  <br /> <br />The most moving character is basketball player Jojo Johanssen, another kid from a hardscrabble background who finds himself in hot water when he actually begins to like learning. The downside of this is that because Jojo has been playing top basketball since high school, he hasn't had much education since middle school. So, should he continue to take soft jock-friendly classes and pass, or risk his scholarship and athletic future by signing up for the philosophy classes he craves and failing? <br /> <br />The goings-on at Dupont are all pretty tawdry, revolving entirely around sex and drinking. Charlotte wonders why people with combined SAT scores of 1550 can act this way. The arrogance and lack of common decency among the students is so overwhelming that some of the scenes are difficult to read. After four years at this school, what kind of person will she be?  <br /> <br />For entertainment, this novel is worth reading, as it is for the questions it poses about the people we will be turning the world over to. I recommend it for both reasons. <br />	2004-12-01

Martin Cruz Smith's Russian detective Arcady Renko began his career discovering bodies in Soviet Gorky Park, went on the lam on the Soviet fishing trawler Polar Star, came back to the force to follow a crime to Havana Bay, and now, he takes on the New Russia, where different wolves eat dogs. Pasha Ivanko is one of those wolves who made the transition from communism to the free market with brazen success, but now he lies smashed on the pavement in front of his luxury apartment building with nothing but a salt shaker to break his fall. In fact, when called to investigate, Arkady finds salt scattered throughout Ivanko's designer digs. His superiors tell him to write it off as a suicide, but somehow he can't. Why would someone who had embraced the new order as gleefully as Pasha kill himself, and what is it with this salt? The murder of Pasha's business partner in neighboring Ukraine earns Arkady a trip to Chernobyl's Zone of Exclusion with its eerie abandoned city still shimmering with radioactivity.  <br /> <br />The number of people who died in the 1986 nuclear explosion at Chernobyl is not known, nor is it known how many will die in the decades to come. The Zone of Exclusion is supposed to be completely de-populated except for scientists who are rotated in and out.  Arkady discovers that the Zone is in fact quite a busy place with a variety of scavengers, entrepreneurs, elderly farm folk and fearless radioactive wild animals calling the place home. Smith loves to put the ironic but big-hearted Renko in surreal environments and this one is certainly one of the weirdest. Solving murders is one thing, but solving them while keeping one eye on radioactive warning signs is really something else. And just in case we've forgotten, the legacy of Chernobyl continues to spread in the form of radioactive bits and pieces scavenged  from Chernobyl and sold across the world.  <br /> <br />The plot is taut and the writing is sharp. In his other Renko novels, Smith worked to shaveaway Russia's layers of artiface until we could see what really lay below. With such rich material as post-communist Russia, it's a shame that \\"Wolves Eat Dogs\\" is a little short in that department, but still, book does not disappoint.  With this harrowing tale, Martin Cruz Smith continues to be one of the most accomplished and compelling mystery writers working today. <br />	2004-11-16

Even now, in film clips, there is something there, something inexplicable that makes you gasp. She strikes you to your deepest core.  That thing, of course, was genius. In her outstanding biography of the great British ballerina, Meredith Daneman guides us through a life lived in art.  \\"Margot Fonteyn\\" is the best sort of biography, one that is as engrossing as a really good novel.  <br /> <br />Born Peggy Hookham in northern England, Fonteyn was fortunate to have fine teachers from the start. When her father's business took the family to Shanghai in the late 1920's, Her astute mother found exiled Russian ballerinas to pass their training on to her. They returned to England in the mid-30's and Peggy auditioned for Ninette de Valois' Sadlers Wells ballet company. She was accepted, re-baptized Margot Fonteyn, and danced for Sadlers Wells (later the Royal Ballet) for most of a career that lasted until she was nearly 60 years old.  <br /> <br />Forget about anorexia, drug problems, temper tantrums, and injuries. \\"Simple\\", and \\"pure\\" are two words used to describe her art, and that simplicity carried over into her life. If she had never rocketed to international fame following the company's first New York visit following WWII, it would have been fine with her.   She learned and grew from every change she faced-never more obvious than her ability to reach a new level of greatness during her partnership with Rudolf Nureyev. That partnership began when she was on the verge of retirement and extended her career for nearly two decades. <br /> <br />If there is any fault with Daneman's biography, it is that it is a little too adoring. Daneman does not skip over Fonteyn's  attraction to unworthy men, notably alky composer Constant Lambert and creepy Panamanian philanderer/thug/husband Tito Arias, but somehow it doesn't show it to detract from her as a person. The photos selected for the book are also a little disappointing. Nonetheless this beautifully written, entrancing biography of genius is a wonderful read and makes you want to  see films, video, anything that lets you again experience the joy of Margot dancing.  <br />	2004-11-04

Memorable characters, a politically and emotionally-charged setting, and clean writing make Vikram Lall's in-between world a fascinating place to be. <br /> <br />When the novel opens, Vic Lall is in Canada, having fled his home in Kenya after being named the most corrupt man in the country. He is the grandson of a man who came from India to build the Kenyan railway, the son of a store owner in a small Kenyan town. He thinks back on the fun he had with his younger sister, Deepa,  neighbor Njoroge, and Bill and Annie, two English children. It is the time of the Mau Mau rebellion when white families were being killed by rebels. It comes too close to their town, and the Lalls make a difficult move Nairobi. <br /> <br />By this time you are wondering how mild fellow like Vikram could possibly have it in him to be named the most corrupt man in an African nation.  The story moves ahead to 1965 when former Mau Mau sympathizer Jomo Kenyata is now president of an independent Kenya. Njoroge is moving up in the government and Vic follows. Now the delicate dance of race and politics comes into play as Njoroge and Deepa begin to play out their childhood fascination with each other, and Vic learns that some things never change. <br /> <br />M.G. Vassanji won Canada's prestigious Giller Prize for this novel, and well he should have, even though he beat out Ann-Marie MacDonald whose \\"The Way the Crow Flies\\" was probably my favorite book last year. In \\"The In-Between World of Vikram Lall\\" he spins  a rich, subtle, carefully layered tale which is also very hard to put down.  <br />	2004-09-23

In most books this would be the end of the story, but Ilse's life is not so simple. The small, shy girl has a Jewish father and a \\"pure\\" Aryan mother, and her father is not only Jewish, he's a communist who has rarely been around. In Morocco, her kind uncle becomes the father she has always wanted but this paradise cannot last. As the war develops, Ilse is sent to her father in Paris and so begins her journey to survive a in a world where the most solid ground can turn to quicksand at any minute. <br /> <br />In Hamburg, her mother finds work as a nanny for friends of her brother. She forms a bond with Nicolai, a boy her daughter's age. Through Ilse and Nicolai we see the world coming apart and two children forced into roles that a sane universe would never ask them to play. The result is a very suspenseful book where like Ilse and Nicolai, you never know what will happen next. <br /> <br />With our fabulous hindsight we often wonder why people-especially Jews-didn't get out of Germany while they could. \\"Children's War\\" brings home the tangle of loyalties, loves, hopefulness, and plain disbelief kept people waiting for things to get better. And then opportunities to leave were cut off even before the war began.  <br /> <br />I understand from British reviews that this book may be the first of a trilogy. Great. I want to find out how Nicolai and Ilse, if they survive the war, survive the peace.  <br />	2004-09-07

Really hated it. But \\"The Egyptologist\\" could not be more different. This is a delightful book, full of complex, flawed, unreliable characters who keep you glued to the page as you try to figure out what in heaven's name they're up to. Add lots of interesting archeological and ancient Egyptian lore, good 1920's period settings, and a great ending, and you have quite a treat in store.    As Howard Carter is discovering King Tut's fabulous tomb, Ralph Trilipush is over the next sand dune digging for the tomb of King Atum-hadu, whose hieroglyphic [slick stuff] (translated with great vigor) obsesses him. Ralph is staking his professional reputation and his fiance's considerable fortune on finding this tomb, and in fact, may have knocked several people off to get to it. At least, that's the belief of an intrepid Australian detective who is traveling the world looking for a murderer, or maybe a serial murder, or maybe even Ralph Trilipush.  The layered construction gives Phillips plenty of opportunity for narrative shenanigans and he relishes them all.     I try to avoid comparing books, but the satisfaction I got from \\"The Egyptologist\\" reminded of the pleasure of reading A. S. Byatt's  \\"Possession.\\" No, the books are not similar and no, this is not another \\"Possession\\", but Phillips has the same respect for his readers' intelligence and he expects you to be able to hang on for the hairpin turns. The result is a smart, teasing, clever, and highly enjoyable novel.	2004-09-02

For anyone who's missed the radio and print ads, \\"Garden of Beasts\\" (a literal translation of the German word Tiergarten, or zoo) takes place in Berlin during the 1936 Olympics, Hitler's grand showcase for Nazi prowess which must rate as one of history's creepiest events. Most people know that, despite Hitler's elaborate choreography of every element of the two-week event, he was upstaged by the success of African-American athletes Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe.  I've always wondered what the repercussions from this were within the Nazi party. <br /> <br />Well, don't look for the answers to any such questions here. The fact that German names are literally translated gives the book an amateur ring. The Olympics do not feature nearly enough in the story, except to offer Paul Schumann the chance to get to Berlin during a closed society's brief period of opening to foreigners. Owens and Metcalfe have two very brief walk-ons for no apparent reason except to show that Deaver knew they were there. They play no part in the plot which is a shame because inside their heads during those games would be a very interesting place to be.  <br /> <br />Schumann is a hired killer, and such a thorough professional that when he thinks his time has come, he just sits back and waits for the final shot. Once he gets to Berlin, however, he makes scores of mistakes and behaves with such a lack of common sense that you have to wonder about the caliber of the competition in New York. This could also be that he is not used to having a thoughtful, intelligent inspector like Willy Kohl on his tail. Kohl, Schumann, and Ernst, the mark, are the novel's three points of view. Oh, and there's a girl, but Paul's affair with her is sudden and perfunctory.  <br /> <br />There are a few good twists, but most of what goes on is just enough to keep you going. I found myself rushing at the end to finish the book and move on to the next thing. This is not Martin Cruz Smith or Len Deighton. Opportunity lost on this one.  <br />	2004-08-18

Maybe there is an updated edition with corrections, but why would any publishing house put out a book this riddled with errors in the first place?     David Wallace is in trouble even before the first chapter of \\"Lost Hollywood.\\" The photo caption on a picture opposite chapter one is full of mistakes. I'm not sure that's ZaSu Pitts, and I question whether the photo is from \\"A Little Princess\\"--a movie in which Pitts played the downtrodden Becky, and this pic shows her in a cute pantaloon outfit with a parasol. At any rate, that movie was not directed by Mack Sennett, as the caption states (it was directed by Marshall Neilan) and although ZaSu P. was in \\"A Little Princess,\\" it was not her first picture and, in fact, \\"A Little Princess\\" starred Mary Pickford. Pitts was always a character actress and never a film heroine as Wallace claims; and \\"Greed\\" was directed by Erich von Stroheim, not DW Griffith as Wallace would have us think.  And this is just a photo caption! What a way to kick off a book.    For someone who lives in Los Angeles, Wallace also has a shaky grasp on LA geography. The city of San Pedro is described as Hollywood's \\"neighbor\\"--it must have taken hours to get from one town to the other in the silent era and it is not much better now. The Edendale studios were in Silverlake, not in Glendale (we're on page 6 at this point).    Does this guy not imagine that there are scores of people who know enough about Hollywood history to be apalled by the lack of easy research? This is a sloppy and innacurate piece of work and there is no excuse for it.	2004-07-15
US	52397641	R326CAIHJJNJRV	0393058123	570668013	Country of Origin: A Novel	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Super	This novel works on all levels-as a mystery, as a literary novel, and as a sharp examination of late-20th-century Japan. Don Lee has written a terrific, engrossing story which will be enjoyed by anyone who loves a good book.<br />In 1980, graduate student Lisa Countryman goes to Japan to work on her doctoral thesis. She's half Japanese, half-black, a Berkeley grad who hopes to learn more about her own background through her research. This path turns risky, and at the opening of the novel, Lisa has already disappeared.<br />The US Embassy official assigned to Lisa's case is on shaky ground himself. Tom Hurley is on his own risky path, hiding his own mixed heritage as he pursues an affair with the wife of a CIA official. A man of such compromised morals wants nothing to do with a disappearance of another bi-racial American, especially one who may have been involved in the Japanese sex underground. Lisa's case falls to Kenzo Ota, a Tokyo detective with so many neuroses that he commands no respect. He gets Lisa's case because in the eyes of his co-workers, the disappearance of such a person is of no consequence whatsoever.<br />Don Lee weaves Lisa's story through Ota's search for her with fluidity and skill. His pointed look at Japanese society in 1980 is intelligent and interesting, with the additional intriguing reflection on the US reaction to bi-racial Americans. \\"Country of Origin\\" is completely satisfying and I look forward to Don Lee's next novel.	2004-07-14

Creating female characters has never been his strong point, and using an observer's eye to tell most of Teresa Mendoza's story works very well. Where you usually hear that good non-fiction \\"reads like a novel\\" here we have a fiction that reads like an investigative report in a quality magazine-one of those addictive pieces you think would make a great book.<br />And it has. The Spanish novelist's latest is the story of Teresa Mendoza, who rose from being a drug smuggler's sweetie in Mexico's narco-capital of Culiacan, Sinaloa, to running one of the largest and most successful drug enterprises on the Mediterranean. There's no play for sympathy for Teresa, no descriptions of her childhood (except for Teresa's brief recall of her mother \\"washing dirty dishes in a tub in the backyard and sleeping with drunken neighbors\\"). Teresa does not ask for sympathy or expect it. She is never innocent. In Culiacan there is no mercy, no consideration. The place has evolved into a Colombian-style society of sociopaths, and she has learned to take what's offered and keep her eyes peeled. The inevitable happens at the start of \\"Queen of the South\\" and Teresa is on the run from page one.<br />There are no heroes in this book; it is an unflinching portrait of an ugly world. The paranoia, manipulation, and joylessness of the drug enterprise is fascinating, with only one character in it for the thrill. Threaded through with the lyrics of Mexican narco-corridos, \\"Queen of the South\\" peels back the skin of modern drug cartels.  This is an exciting, creepy read.	2004-07-11

His wife, the bold, arty Julia, their son Will (who is not really their son but an infant given to them after a peculiar mixup in the maternity ward), and later a pair of rambunctious twin boys join him in these travels which take them first to Bahrain, then back to Africa, then to England, and finally to New Jersey. In one place after another Will falls for the odd-girl-out and the twins pick up the local accent and wreak the havoc particular to that place. <br />The Laments' adventures are charming and endrossing, even when their story begins to darken upon their arrival in the US. John-Irving-ish events occur which cast a pall over the family and make the reader wonder about the purpose of sending the story in this direction. Is it to show that suburban America can be the weirdest place of all? Don't we know that already? When Howard recommends that the Laments move again, you'll be all for it if it means getting them out their increasingly uncomfortable situation.<br />George Hagen is a first novelist of great talent with a high-spirited, engaging style and the ability to create appealing characters. \\"The Laments\\" is the sort of book readers will look forward to getting back to. He still has some learning to do (the twins, George, the twins!) but this will not lessen the enjoyment of this novel.

The shocks were felt from south of Los Angeles to central Oregon. Fires turned the city into an inferno for four days, and almost a hundred years later, the number of people killed remains unknown.  With all this going on, it is hard to imagine a book in which the San Francisco earthquake is almost as an anticlimax, but here it is. \\"1906\\" is so busy with overwrought plot that the earthquake pales in comparison to the melodramatic goings-on. <br />I won't even go into the story. I was hoping for something like \\"Paradise Alley\\" or \\"Banished Children of Eve\\" which explored the effect of a large and tragic event on a range of characters, giving the reader insight into the event, the time period, and the way people reacted to both, all the while offering a whale of a good read. Alas, not here. An excellent opportunity was tossed aside and replaced with a lot of bad-movie clutter.<br />I did like was the treatment of the Enrico Caruso phenomenon. San Francisco had gone crazy for the great tenor, who was in town to sing Don Jose in \\"Carmen.\\" People from miles away had crowded into San Francisco for a glimpse of the cheerful Italian who was probably the most famous man in the world at that time. This good-natured trouper with a voice blessed by God and his feet firmly on the ground uncomplainingly traveled to the remotest parts of the globe to perform, but of San Francisco he said, \\"Hell of a place. I never sing here again.\\" <br />\\"1906\\"  has \\"movie treatment\\" written all over it, and indeed, it seems to have been optioned by a film company already. With the centenary of the earthquake only two years away, I'm still waiting for the novel that will pin that moment in history.	2004-05-06

It even has that very rare attribute of real suspense--I had no idea how it would end. What a treat.<br />There is always that temptation to compare one writer to another, but I am going to avoid that. Because Vincent,the main character, speaks fluent Chinese, he is able to get inside the mainland and Taiwanese cultures in a way that is rare in books written by foreigners. Once that level of mystery is stripped away from a culture hidden for so long from Western eyes, China emerges even quirkier than we would imagine.  Earnest Vincent from Red Bud, Illinois, makes an excellent guide into this world.  His pragmatic nature cuts down on bouts of hysteria, yet he is a young guy and does make some surprising judgement calls.<br />I will warn you that &quot;Heaven Lake&quot; does get off to a slowish start, but stick with it. Once Vincent begins to get his Taiwan ministry into action, you will not want to leave his side for long enough to eat breakfast. Your only regret in picking this book up is that it is not longer; although if it were, it might not be so perfect.--Candace Siegle	2004-04-01

This is important because once you finishedhis new novel \\"The Last Crossing\\" you will be scouring libraries, bookstores, and the internet for more. <br />What a good writer! His 1996 novel \\"The Englishman's Boy\\" was also excellent, but his newest book reaches an even higher level. His use of multiple points of view is marvelous and the characters have a depth and appeal that adds excitement, pathos, and surprise to a really good plot.<br />In the 1870's, a young Englishman named Simon Gaunt travels into Montana as a missionary and vanishes. His difficult, heartbroken father orders his two other sons to go to Ft. Benton and find him at all costs. Addington is a disgraced military man and Simon's twin Charles is a painter disappointed in himself for his own shallow nature. Charles is desperate to find Simon but Addington seems to look on the whole trip as one big outdoor adventure, showing up at the fort with a seedy, sycophantic \\"newspaperman\\" who plans to record Addington's feats in the wilderness for the penny press. They contract the Blackfoot/Scottish guide Jerry Potts to lead them, but by the time the Gaunts' wagons leave  Ft. Benton, they have also collected a woman searching for her sister's killer and are trailed by the man who loves her, and who in turn is trailed by his best friend. The search for the missing missionary is in danger of being derailed by the quirks and passions of his search party. But Simon Gaunt remains the lodestar for this group, and only later do we find out why.<br />\\"The Last Crossing\\" is satisfying, readable, thoughtful, and thrilling. If you have not read Guy Vanderhaeghe before, he is a wonderful discovery.	2004-02-02

US	52397641	RU2RPBSXCI8ML	0316000647	657855247	Absolute Friends	Books	3	6	15	N	N	A Step Back	It seems silly now to recall all that hand-wringing about whether the end of the Cold War would mean curtains for the spy novel. John Le Carre brilliantly explored other options for intrigue in \\"The Constant Gardner,\\" but now he's put his old German trench coat back on in a novel that burns with indignation but falls short of \\"Gardner\\"'s humanity and complexity.<br />In \\"Absolute Friends\\" the kind-hearted son of a British Army officer in India named Ted Mundy and Sasha, the crippled son of a former Nazi, form a bond that begins in the 1960s. The easy-going Ted has, mostly through his inability to say no to anyone, been a double agent in the pre-Wall-fall days. Ted used his earnings to open a language school in Germany, which went under when he was defrauded by a partner. Now Ted is sort of on the lam, working as a tour guide at Mad Ludwig's Castle in Bavaria and living with a Turkish woman and her son. He is happy. After many years of silence, Sasha contacts him, saying that an anonymous benefactor needs Ted's linguistic and teaching skills in a plan to counter pro-Iraq-war propaganda. Ted's desire to do good is reengaged, and he accepts the assignment. <br />I've always found Le Carre's spy world of  \\"tradecraft,\\" \\"handlers,\\" and \\"little Jews\\" (or whatever ethnic group he's discussing) too precious and British public school to really resonate with me, and I was much taken with how well he applied the new rules of the alleged new world order to a truly desperate area like Africa. \\"Absolute Friends\\" will please fans of the Cold War books with its concentration on the minutiae of the spy game and its personalities. Ted is a fully-developed  character, not quite believeable, but appealing. Sasha, on the other hand, remains a cipher and it is difficult to understand why his friendship is so important to Ted.  Le Carre's new book is a good read, but the intelligence with which he probed the issues in \\"The Constant Gardner\\" made it seem as though he were setting on a new,exciting path that could be a model for the genre.	2004-01-16

Thomas Mallon takes his usual historic care with a period, but lets the 1920s fizz and roar with humor and spot-on observations. Bandbox (as in \\"he looks just like he stepped out of a . . .\\") is a fashion magazine for men. Only recently B'box, as the press calls it, was a fading rag for the lavender crowd, but then editor Jehosephat  Harris (known as Joe or 'Phat) added top fiction, adventure, crime writing and romantic tips for single men and this new style mag has turned the New York magazine scene on its ear. Joe Harris was at the top of the world until his second-in-command was lured away by Conde Nast to start rival men's magazine Cutaway. Jimmy Gordon is now trying anything he can to ruin Bandbox, and it looks like he's doing a good job. <br />The Bandbox staff is a combination of the ambitious (who may be spying for Gordon), the disillusioned, the creative, the artistic, and those on the wagon, and those off the wagon. The women on staff, reveling in the opportunities the new decade has offered them, are probably the most competent, but even they are as wacky as all get out  There's a lot of drinking, making payoffs to cops,  avoiding gangsters, writing snappy prose, and trading quips. Bandbox must be saved, but with every strategy backfiring in their faces, it looks as though our beloved  staffers may be seeking jobs at places like Catholic World before long.<br />Mallon builds plenty of momentum and enough suspense to keep you guessing at the fate of the magazine and its dedicated staff up until the very end. The unforced dialogue has the true ring of the 20's and is fun to follow. The female characters especially are believable and fun, filled with the heady excitement from the new freedom women enjoyed after the first World War. Some of the male characters take longer to  gel and it is necessary to keep checking back to see who they are.   <br />This is frisky, charming book where the madcap 20s roar with fun.

The number of reviewers who passionately disliked this book makes me wonder what they were expecting, or if they just weren't in the mood for this kind of book. &quot;Saul and Patsy&quot; is a very well-done novel that keeps your attention throughout, even though there's something a little, I don't know, uncomfortable about the couple's decision to relocate to a small town in rural Michigan. There's something a little off-putting about these two and their choices that is hard to put your finger on. <br />&quot;Saul and Patsy&quot; does have the sense of having been worked up from short stories, notably because characters who have already been introduced get the full intro treatment several times, as if this were the first time you were meeting them. Besides this small annoyance, it is hard to pick out where the stories were knitted into the larger novel.<br />I looked forward to  &quot;Saul and Patsy,&quot; which, after all, is what reading a good book should be all about.	2004-01-10

His parents have had to make an emergency trip to America, leaving him behind at a really boring job at Jersusalem City Hall. His best friend, whom he's protected from bullies since first grade, is suddenly the most popular boy in school and only willing to hang out with Assaf if Assaf joins him in activities Assaf would rather avoid. Missing his family and hopelessly bored at his make-work job, the moony sixteen-year-old is bewildered when his supervisor hands him the leash of the most disruptive dog in the animal shelter and tells him to go find the owner and hand that person a big citation for letting the yellow Labrador run loose. Suddenly, Assaf is being hauled all over town by an excited dog who seems to know exactly where she is going. Throughout the day he collects bits and pieces of information about the dog's owner, another sixteen-year-old who may be in trouble. He is determined to find this girl and return her beloved dog to her.<br />Across town, Tamar is a girl on a much more dangerous mission: to save a drug-addicted boy from an underworld impresario who sends talented runaway kids to perform on street corners across Israel, taking their earnings in return for drugs and a place to crash. The yellow Lab, Dinka, is her dog. How did they become separated? What is innocent Assaf getting involved in here? Who is the boy Tamar is trying to rescue?<br />I found this the most enjoyable of the David Grossman novels I've read. The translation by Vered Almog and Maya Gurantz is so fluid that \\"Someone to Run With\\" reads as though it was originally written in English. We get a look at a number of aspects of modern Israeli society from runaway and homeless teenagers to Assaf's close working-class family; from a cloistered nun to the mafia; from a big city that can still seem like a small town to wastelands where abandoned kids lie in ragged shelters. With skill and heart, Goodman shows, rather than tells us the differences and disparity in Israeli society. This enlightening adventure will satisfy both adult and older teen readers. ----Candace Siegle	2004-01-03

The cob house is especially drafty and cold because John would not listen to anyone's advice and has placed the house in the most disadvantageous place possible. You know from the start that this trio is in for trouble. <br />After the death of his debt-ridden father, John sells everything remaining when the debt collectors are done with it and takes his mother and new bride to the opposite side of the world for a fresh start. It is the mid-19th century and New Zealand seems as good a place as any to start a farm. But John's decisions are weirdly off-kilter, making everything even harder than it need be. Lilian plots her escape, and Harriet wonders what happened to the fleeting bliss she and her new husband knew while preparing to emigrate. Something is wrong here, something that is exacerbated by the discovery of gold-\\"the colour\\" of the title.<br />This is a rich and mysterious novel, a place where grueling days of sodbusting meet the cloudy mountains of a dreamtime. Rose Tremain has the ability to imbue her story with the kind of deep emotion that cannot be described and do it in a most readable fashion. The setting and the characters of \\"The Colour \\" all ring true, including the mystical ties between an English child and a Maori woman. This is an worthy addition to Rose Tremain's  earlier novels, which are worth checking out if you haven't done so already.

Actually, \\"The Touch\\" is not quite a romance (I seem to have been  influenced by the yearning profile on the cover as well) but something more interesting. Read on.<br />Rich goldminer and entrepreneur Alexander Kinross writes to a Scottish relative for a bride. He gets Elizabeth Drummond, who at 16 has lived a joyless life.  Alexander is handsome and charismatic, but  contrary to what might be expected, she is repelled by him. He's sorry she doesn't like him, but since he has a very satisfactory mistress all he expects of Elizabeth is that she do her duty. Although she lives in a grand house opulently furnished, Elizabeth's life in Australia is as  repressed as her life in Scotland was. That is, until she meets Ruby, her husband's mistress.<br />Ruby and Alexander love each other deeply, but the fact that she runs a suspect hotel and has a son by a Chinese businessman means no wedding bells for them. Next to Alexander, Ruby is the town's most influential citizen (with her Chinese ex-lover a close third), so it is certain that Elizabeth and Ruby will meet. They do, and like each other immediately. <br />This fine how-do-you-do is the crux of an entertaining story that will have you looking forward to the next chapter. Set between 1872 and 1900, this booming period of Australian history  provides a lively background for the appealing characters' surprising but believable lives. It is a pleasure to see Colleen McCullough back at the sort of fiction which flows from her pen so easily as to seem almost organic. Unlike her Roman series where historical detail began to smother characterization and action, `The Touch\\"  is bound to please  from first page to last.	2003-12-01

Vesuvius at Pompeii--79 AD . . .rivers of bubbling magma . . .citizens immortalized in pleading poses for all eternity by ash . . .the heedless rich getting their comeuppance from nature. Those basics are true, but Robert Harris reminds us that the eruption of Vesuvius was much more than that. It remains one of history's greatest and most dramatic disaster stories, and we know a great deal about it because one of the Roman Empire's greatest historians was there to write a blow-by-blow record of the destruction; and although Pliny did not survive, his report did.    Pompeii and Herculaneum were the Malibu and Santa Barbara of Rome. In the hot August of 79 AD, tourists were swarming to the cool coast to enjoy the luxury accommodations, crystal swimming pools, and elegant spas of the bayside resorts. Marcus Attilius is there too, but  he's not there to enjoy the occasional cool breeze, he's there to work as the new aquarius of the Aqua Augusta--the new water engineer in charge of the enormous aqueduct that brings endless water flowing to the nine towns around the Bay of Naples. Springs are failing for the first time in centuries and the flow of water is being disrupted to hundreds of thousands of people. Attilius' family has worked on the great aqueducts for generations, but even he is bewildered by the cause of this crisis somewhere along the Aqua Augusta's sixty-mile line--a line that stretches along the slopes of Mt. Vesuvius.    The Roman aqueducts were an amazing feat, and Harris describes their workings in great detail. He does an excellent job of showing, not telling, and through Attilius and his crew he weaves an incredible amount of information into the narrative and it is fascinating. Also excellently done is his description of the various effects of the eruption--which lasted several days--where he uses Pliny's observation of the event of excellent effect. Pliny, historian and general, was also a very fatand cranky old man by 79 AD. He took one of his ships out into the bay to watch and record the devastation from what he thought was a safe distance. But too soon the ships in the bay were in danger from the roiling waves and huge chunks of pumice flying down off the mountain. Pliny had his scribes don helmets and take down his descriptions as clods of pumice bounced off the old general's uncovered head--\\"The pumice is less like rock than airy fragments of a frozen cloud.\\" he dictates. \\"It floats on the surface of the sea like lumps of ice. Extraordinary!\\" Eventually it would clog the bay and begin to crush ships. Pliny knew he was too heavy and unsteady to escape the final firestorm from Vesuvius and ordered his scribes to save themselves and his precious reportage. Fortunately they did, and Robert Harris puts Pliny's observation to fine use in this novel.    Harris is a workmanlike writer with the gift of being able to integrate complicated information into a believable narrative. That's what made \\"Enigma\\" and \\"Fatherland\\" so interesting, and what works for \\"Pompeii.\\" The characters are take second place to the setting, and are not particularly exciting. However, they respond to the extraordinary circumstances around them in ways that are completely consistent with their characterizations. It is the same with Harris' establishment of place. He offers no special explanations of Rome, but builds it all into the action. As a result the Roman world seems very immediate and almost modern.	2003-11-19

He is a traveling salesman, she a refugee from East Germany living in a displaced person's camp. The two enjoy some rough sex during which Marie inexplicably dies. Did he kill her? Less than ten years after the end of WWII, Germans were sick of perversions but not ready to challenge the report by a leading forensic scientist.

A journalist and a novelist become interested in his case and bring an East German forensic scientist to the West to offer another scenario for what might have happened on that warm September afternoon.<br />The Arbogast case was a sensational crime of its time, and Thomas Hettche has written a compelling and creepy novel. If you like action and big climaxes, you won't find them here. This is a very subtle novel of psychological suspense, written with just the right tone and given a sharp, immediate translation by Elizabeth Gaffney.

What we do know is that the literary world would have missed this writer of intelligent, politically-influenced fiction.  With \\"Feast of the Goat\\" and now with \\"The Way to Paradise,\\" Vargas Llosa turns his astute gaze to Europe and the Pacific, and demonstrates that he can write masterfully about cultures and countries other than his own. <br />In the new book he traces the life of painter Paul Gauguin and his grandmother, the socialist feminist Flora Tristan. Set in France and the South Pacific with a brief sojourn in Peru, he charts the courses of two related people who never knew each other, and whose lives were similar in that they found the conventions of their times impossible to live with. <br />Flora Tristan grew up in poverty as the illegitimate daughter of a French mother and a Peruvian father. Her marriage was abusive and she escaped her husband to reinvent herself as a popular writer and campaigner for workers' rights. Despite failing health, she tours the small towns of France recruiting members for her Workers' Union. Her grandson Paul abandons his large family and friendship with other painters to escape to Tahiti to paint. Riddled with syphilis, his health is failing as well.<br />Natasha Wimmer's translation is excellent. There are scenes that glow with the golden light of Arles or sting with the scent of the sea. Where \\"Paradise\\" misses the mark is through an irritating literary device where rhetorical questions or comments are made of the characters in the second person: \\"Was it because of the  woman in Panama that your vision was weakened, your heart was failing, and your legs were covered with pustules?\\" or:  \\"You would later remember those two hours of absurd debate, Florita.\\" You get the idea. It adds nothing to the narrative and is a jarringly false step from such a sure-footed writer.	2003-11-06

And who can resist the story of a small publisher taking a big risk on this novel and having it pay off?<br />I passed \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" up several times because I was afraid it was going to be a mess. You've got nearly 500 pages of a very crafty plot. The main character slips in and out of time. No, he does not find himself on the starship Enterprise on one page and in a thicket in ancient Gaul on the next. This is more subtle. His time slips are of a few years, months, or even weeks. Sometimes he runs into himself at another age. Clare, whom he meets as a child, knows they will be together, but she is stuck on a regular time line. The possibilities for muddle are myriad, but somehow Audrey Niffenegger keeps it straight and keeps you involved.<br />Nonetheless some canny editing would have helped the story--Henry ends up naked on a strange street (which happens when he time travels) a few too many times. But just about the time you're ready to say \\"oh, no,not again,\\" Niffenegger beings the tale to a satisfying close.<br />Imaginative and enjoyable, \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" is worthy of the fanfare and will please readers of multiple genres.	2003-10-29

Shirley Hazzard is an excellent writer, and she has chosen an exciting place and time period (post WWII Asia) but \\"The Great Fire\\" lacked the spark to set the conflagration alight. <br />The main character, Aldred, has come to postwar Japan to write a book on the effects of war on an ancient society. He meets an Australian military family and is much taken with their children-a young teenager named Helen, and Ben, who is certainly dying. The parents are awful in the way of awful people in 19th century Russian or French novels in that they are so bad you know they're out there someplace. The children's lives have been so constrained that they live through classic literature. Although Helen is still very young, Aldred falls in love with her.<br />The other element of the plot concerns Aldred's friend Peter Exley who is in Japan to interrogate Japanese war criminals. His crisis has to do with how to spend his own future and whether he can he abandon his career in law to do what he really wants. <br />\\"The Great Fire\\" has a very 19th century feel about it. The characters behave in ways that seem more fitting to people in 1847 than 1947. It is a very quiet book where a great deal happens, but when the book is over it is hard to explain exactly what.  I found Shirley Hazzard's choice of time and place strangely out of sync with that she expresses. Ultimately, the book fails to engage and seems more like an academic exercise in \\"good\\" writing than something meant to move the reader.	2003-10-17

But who today remembers Frances Wright? Not surprising that she is forgotten, writes Frances Trollope in her \\"biography\\" of the flame-haired Scottish feminist. \\"She was too challenging, too uncomfortable to be remembered.\\"<br />And who today remembers Fanny Trollope, either? The author of bestselling non-fiction beloved for her piercing eye and skewering wit is now probably known only as the mother of Victorian novelist Anthony Trollope. Edmund White explores the lives of two Englishwomen who had tremendous impact on the young United States, and in this clever, quirky novel,  reminds us of the idealistic roots of our nation and the mythic lure of the American dream.<br />By the time Fanny Trollope met Fanny Wright she was already in her fifties, living in a dank cottage with smoking fireplaces, too many children and a sick husband who had lost the family's money.  She welcomes the visiting Fanny Wright who lights up the dismal homeplace with  the power of her utopian idealism. Fanny T. is enchanted, and like so many others decides that America is the place where she can launch her oldest son in a career and take part in a noble experiment. What happens on this journey is the reason why, twenty-five years later, Fanny Trollope sits down to write this very ungenerous \\"biography\\" of the other Fanny.<br />Trollope became famous for the book she wrote upon her return that lambasted the United States, a book that, if it is anything like what White describes here, must be a real hoot. Her views are acute and funny (a trip to the French town of Brie: \\"they make a smelly, runny cheese, a slutty mess that makes one long for chaste cheddar\\"). But like many people able to smartly sum up others, she is completely oblivious to what is going on with those directly around her. <br/>Shabby, with many of her teeth stuck to her gums with chunks of wax, incredibly astute and totally clueless, Fanny Trollope is an unlikely heroine. She is impossible not to like, but what is her fixation with Fanny Wright? This is a witty, tart, and ultimately moving look at a friendship gone awry,  disappointment with utopian ideals, and the humanity of heroes. <br />The last book I read by Edmund White was his bio of Jean Genet, so I would certainly have to agree with the critics that \\"Fanny\\" is a departure for him. He seems high on the oxygen of this new endeavor and writes with a lovely freedom and wit. Both the Fannys are a pleasure.	2003-10-10

She lives with her mother and stepfather in an affluent New York suburb, and knows little of her father, a Vietnam vet who met her mother when he came to tell her about the death of his best friend, her brother Joey Santiago. Vidamia describes herself as American and soon be meeting a host of people of all colors, races, and backgrounds, all of whom have added their spice to make her who she is. <br />She's a girl from the suburbs, but she is not fazed when the first step on her quest takes her into a working-class Irish bar. Eduardo Vega Yunque gives his tale a twist with a little role reversal-her PhD mother and CPA stepdad are Puerto Rican, while the unconventional, spirited family she discovers on the Lower East Side are white. Her father, Billy Farrell, has married a Tennessee woman, and their tow-headed offspring talk like the neighborhood homies even though their favorite family outing is to play bluegrass in the subway. Billy was a talented jazz pianist before going to Vietnam, where he lost several fingers and gained a whopping case of post traumatic stress disorder. He is now afraid that touching a keyboard again will bring back the agony of losing his best friend and his fear that he was responsible for his death<br />The themes of race, region, class, family, and music-making are all embraced in this big-hearted book, which keeps up a lively beat throughout. Tunes are always playing in the background, and although \\"Bill Bailey\\" doesn't have the sensitivity to music of, say, Richard Powers' \\"The Time of Our Singing\\" or Frank Conroy's \\"Body & Soul\\" there is enough there to provide the story with a good soundtrack. Thecharacters are well developed and appealing with the exception of Vidamia's mother; Elsa, who is too negative to be believable.  Bill sings too long, but for the most part this is a novel of substance and pleasure.	2003-09-29

Wonderfully written and beautifully realized, it is captivating from start to finish.<br />It is the early 1960s, and Madeleine McCarthy's Canadian Air Force family is moving back to a base in Ontario after being posted in Germany. MacDonald lovingly paints a rich portrait of the rituals and traditions of families who move every three years--the neighbors, the welcome barbeques, the women who automatically greet new arrivals with enough food to see the new family through the unpacking stage, the kids who relish the anticipation of finding a  new best friend. MacDonald takes time setting this all up. It is so friendly, so happy, that something must be wrong, but what? Pay attention, because she is planting little mines all over the place, and they will explode.<br />Madeline's loving French-Canadian mother, her adored dad, her kind older brother, are created with such love that they break your heart. The early sixties are a character in themselves, a time when WWII was a fresh memory and the cold war was a fact of life. Scientists were being smuggled out of the East to spill their secrets to the West. We talk about the Bay of Pigs in an abstract fashion today, forgetting how terrifying it was at the time and how it effected the psyches of  everyone who lived through it. <br />\\"The Way the Crow Flies\\"  is certainly one of my favorite books so far this year. It hiccups once the life of the adult Madeleine takes stage, but does that take away from the affect of this novel? No. Ann-Marie McDonald is a sweet, tough writer.

The addictive properties of this book are such that as soon as I put it down, I jumped up to order the two other books in the Lytton trilogy from the UK. Penny Vincenzi is a huge seller in Europe and it is easy to see why.  \\"No Angel\\" has the full cast of vivid characters, urgent situations, and confident writing that make the family saga one of the most venerable and satisfying of fiction genres.<br />Despite the stylish 1950s fashion cover, \\"No Angel\\" is set between 1904 and 1928. Aristocratic Lady Celia has gotten herself pregnant so she can marry Oliver Lytton. The Lyttons may own a publishing house, but they are not of Celia's class. The match is a success, and easy-going Oliver and sparky Celia are a happy couple. But it seems inevitable that Celia should become restless and look for more to do than peek in on the children occasionally. She dabbles in social activism, which awkwardly ends with her fostering Barty, the little daughter of the slum family she's supposed to be observing. She carefully begins to take small part in the business of Lyttons, which is now run by Oliver and his sister LM. When the Great War breaks out, Oliver enlists, and it is up to LM and Celia to keep the publishing house that supports them all afloat. <br />With her brains, looks, and business sense, Celia would seem to be a slam-dunk for a charmed life. But no one's life is, least of all the Lyttons, who are as full of flaws, bad judgment, humor, and hope as anybody else. There is excellent period detail, with a fascinating look at the publishing industry in the early part of the century, social activism, family dynamics, World War I, fashion, and popular culture. One of the most pleasing aspects of the book is that Vincenzi has created strong female characters without having to resort to assigning them anachronistic behavior. They are women of their time and behave as such.  <br />\\"No Angel\\" has an exciting ending and you will be kept on the edge of your seat to the last page. Considering the way the characters have developed, any number of possible endings would be believable. Whew! This is an adept and satisfying novel that will bring hours of pleasure. My question is: What took so long for this enjoyable writer's books to reach these shores?	2003-09-26

Unlike other reviews listed here, I did not find his prose difficult, but enjoyed its richness and color, and found \\"The Known World\\" filled with flawed and genuine people of all races who grapple with slavery-America's \\"peculiar institution\\"-in a way that will surprise and compel readers.<br />Mourners come to Manchester County, Virginia to bury Henry Townsend and comfort his widow Caldonia. Henry was only 31 years old, a successful landowner and the owner of 33 slaves. He was also black, and a former slave himself. His human property learned from the start that working for a black master was no different from working for a white-or an Indian, for that matter. But they hold out the tiniest shred of hope that Caldonia, who was born free, will free them.<br />Henry's father Augustus bought his own freedom from his owner, Bill Robbins. He then worked to buy his wife, and then his son. But Henry always felt more affinity with Robbins than he did with his own family, shocking his parents when he buys his first slave. There are a number of black and Cherokee slave owners in the area who look on slaves with perhaps even more dispassionate eyes than do their white neighbors. \\"The legacy,\\" Henry's mother-in-law calls his slaves when Caldonia briefly considers manumitting them. \\"Don't throw away the legacy.\\"<br />I have never found a book that looks at slavery like \\"The Known World\\" does. Throw your preconceived notions out the window and be prepared to be completely pulled into a world where, no matter the characters' race, nothing is black and white.	2003-09-12

Literate, funny, and suspenseful, Foul Matter will please her current fans and should find her lots of happy new ones.<br />Paul Giverney writes good, extremely popular novels, and hes shopping for a new publisher. He likes Mackenzie-Haake, but before he makes a final decision, he makes a demand of acquisitions editor Clive Esterhaus--the publishing house must drop Ned Isaly, one of its most respected literary authors. Clive takes this proposal to Bobby Mackenzie, the Mackenzie of Mackenzie-Haake, who decides that since they have absolutely no reason to drop Ned--and imagine the lawsuit!--it will be more cost effective to hire someone to knock him off. Suddenly Clive is meeting with people in the Witness Protection Program on deserted New York piers, bribing mobsters with book contracts, and hiring the two best hitmen in the business.  These guys are so successful that they only whack people they dont like, which means that they have to get to know Ned before they accept the job. They want two weeks to become acquainted with their mark, an unassuming fellow who is happily surrounded by writer friends. How Candy and Karl, with their unstructured Versace suits (perfect for concealing large weapons without losing their line) and scary manners are going to infiltrate that crowd Clive cannot imagine, but he agrees. <br />The characters are a trip, and placing the book in New York and Pittsburgh (some of the most memorable scenes take place in Pittsburgh) suits Grimes well. One of the topics discussed by  Foul Matters characters is how to classify fiction, which is obviously something this novel brings up. Heres Paul, who has written a book that goes beyond his usual genre, lumped in the with same stuff he usually writes. Theres Jamie, who writes readable books within the rigid confines of genre fiction. And theres Martha Grimes, who with this novel should probably move off the mystery shelf. But where should Foul Matter go? Will the fact that book stores wont immediately know how to categorize it effect its sales? Whats happening to publishing and to readers who need to have books tucked neatly into categories in order to know what to read? <br />I hope Martha Grimes sticks to her new path. With this novel she shows she is a writer who cannot be categorized. Foul Matter is fresh and funny not to be missed.	2003-08-26

Anyone who appreciates good non-fiction will not be disappointed in \\"Under the Banner of Heaven,\\" which carries the subtitle of \\"A Story of Violent Faith.\\" Krakauer is not writing about Palestinian suicide bombers or Al-Queda's willing recruits. He's writing about residents of what another writer called \\"the Republic of Clean\\"-the Mormons.<br />In 1984, Brenda Lafferty and her infant daughter were brutally murdered by Dan and Ron Lafferty, her brothers-in-law. The brothers said that God had been ordered them to kill the young woman and her little girl because she vocally opposed her husband's participation in his family's attraction to an offshoot of Mormonism that embraced polygamy. Krakauer uses the murder as a springboard into his examination of the roots of the Mormon religion and its increasingly rancorous relationship with Mormon fundamentalists, the breakaway groups which do not accept Salt Lake City's edicts in regard to banning polygamy or accepting blacks into the religion. <br />The history of Mormonism is fascinating and bloody, but the real chilling stuff is in the sections on remote fundamentalist enclaves where interpretations of \\"celestial marriage\\" has lead to child abuse, incest, degradation of women and children, and always more violence. Krakauer touches on the kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart as well as the Lafferty case. <br />One of the most important tenets of the Mormon religion is that everyone can speak personally with God, and that God will guide them.  In the prison interviews with Dan Lafferty years after the murders, the coherent, affable killer maintains that his only motive was to fulfill God's command. Jon Krakauer does not have to draw comparisons between this type of thinking and the Taliban-in this balanced and farsighted book, they are all too obvious.	2003-07-10

Christopher, the 15-year-old autistic hero of Mark Haddon's first novel, presents a fresh, touching, and funny take on everyday life. He has no guile, no pretence. He tries to remember the coping skills taught in his special school, but they are just like mathematical formulas to him as he follows the designated steps on how to behave in a specific situation. Actually, mathematical formulas make a lot more sense to him, but for the sake of others he is willing to try.<br />Haddon's prose is simple with a different rhythm-Christopher is obviously just a little bit off everyone else's beat-and you are immediately enveloped in this boy's world. It is like seeing the world through the eyes of a spaceman who has studied earthlings assiduously for millennia and is trying to put his bookwork into practical application on his first visit to Earth.  <br />The mystery of the \\"Curious Incident\\" has less to do with the dog in the nighttime than it does with the mysterious workings of the human heart. This moving book is not to be missed.	2003-06-26

Charles Dickinson is a wonderful writer who should have a much larger readership than  he seems to. He employs his clear and winning prose to describe the lives of ordinary people living their daily lives, but there's always an interesting little kink in those lives. In \\"The Widows' Adventures,\\" two elderly sisters leave their suburban Illinois homes for a trip to Los Angeles. One of the sisters is blind. She's the one who's driving. The sensitive protagonist of \\"Waltz in Marathon\\" is a loan shark. The artist hero of \\"A Shortcut in Time\\" lives in the town he was born and raised in, yet on a familiar neighborhood path he meets people slipping back and forth in time. For a man with many regrets, there is the temptation to try to tweek the past. Unfortunately, he is not the only person with this compulsion.<br />I recommend this novel highly, and I envy anyone picking up a Charles Dickinson book for the first time.

Michael Byers shows that he can bring his gift for short-story writing to a novel, and the characters explode deep and fully-developed  from the first line and grow from there. The result is a very fine and moving read. <br />Henry Moss is a research doctor working on Hickman, a condition that causes children to age rapidly and die prematurely. As he tests the DNA of a new patient's family, he discovers that the boy's 17-year-old brother has a blood mutation that might permit him to stop the syndrome's deadly progress. He is faced with the most human of dilemmas when he must decide whether to try the new enzyme on a dying child before testing is even begun. A very kind and decent man, Henry is wracked by the possibilities he faces: he may lose his license, he may save a life, or he may become incredibly rich-a possibility he sees all around him in mid-90's Seattle where the book is set.<br />Everyone in \\"Long for this World\\" is a marvelous creation. Henry's Austrian wife, Ilse, has a story of her own and a martinet mom who has moved to a nearby condo. His daughter is a gifted athlete, and his son a sweet, goofy 14-year-old. You become engrossed in the lives of his favorite Hickman patient and his family, and in the family of the strange atypical-positive teenager who is the catalyst for so much hope.<br />\\"Long for this World\\" will entrance everyone who picks it up because of its humanity, humor, and warmth.

This is quite a challenge because the Bangkok police force is shockingly corrupt even by Asian standards. Pichai is about to return to the monastery for his vows when he is killed by a snake bite to the eye, and Sonchai must avenge him. <br />It's not a new plot device, but it certainly gets a fresh coat of paint in this wild and eye-popping trip through the Thai take on sex, religion, traffic, drugs, and past lives (Sonchai can see what people have been and what life they're in for next). It is Thai noir in a saffron robe. <br />An African-American Marine is murdered in a Mercedes-full of hopped-up cobras. Sonchai, who speaks excellent English and whose father obviously was a foreigner of some sort, would be just the man to work with the FBI on this one. The agent is a sexy young woman, and together they uncover some really weird and fascinating stuff which will not be revealed in this review. Readers will want to find out for themselves.<br />\\"Bangkok 8\\" is original and thrilling, but for some reason John Burdette still felt that he had to make standard choices to appeal to Western readers. Why does Sonchai have to be half white? It seems likely given his mother's profession that he wouldn't be pure Thai, but readers would be able to empathize with him no matter what his racial makeup. Of course the FBI agent is an attractive woman and of course there is sexual tension. Perhaps Burdette thinks he must use stock situations to help readers relate this exotic world, but it really isn't necessary. His characters are so immediately empathetic and so fully rooted that you would find life on the planet Splok comprehensible through their eyes. <br />\\"Bangkok 8\\" is like a motor-taxi ride at full speed through a neon jungle. The colors blur and your heart's in your throat, but you wouldn't have missed the trip for the world.	2003-06-04

This was one tabloid writer's summation of what attracted the woman of the 1920s with her short skirt and bobbed hair to the cult of the former Rodolfo Guglielmi, a mild-mannered guy from a little town in southern Italy. Emily Leider's biography is huge, but there really isn't much to tell about Valentino's life. He was easy-going and lazy, he flunked out of school, and he was a beautiful dancer. He smoldered on film for a brief period, but wasted what would be a short career in stupid legal battles that kept him off screen for two whole years before dying at the age of 31. The extraordinary sensuality that radiated off him on screen was almost completely absent in real life. He was not very deep or complex, but men and women alike found him polite and nice.<br />Obviously, what would make the biography of such person interesting would be a discussion of the social forces that switched the public's appetite for leading men from wholesome all-American-looking guys to such an unmistakably foreign \\"dark lover.\\" There's the angle of why studio executives- a venal crew if ever there was one-would squander such a hot commodity by underpaying and disregarding him, thus losing millions of dollars when he stayed off-screen to protest. What about him frightened them so much?<br />Emily Leider covers some of this, but not enough to give her big bio more weight. Since so little is known about Valentino's early life, she can only speculate about what might have influenced him: he might have seen Nijinsky and been influenced by his sensuous dance, she imagines, but, considering what a lightweight Rudy was, I would bet the guy was more likely to be found happily munching peanuts at a Keystone comedy. <br />Still, \\"Dark Lover\\" is an entertaining read. Sometimes Leider's prose reads like silent movie title cards, which is pretty fun, and you do get a sense of how revolutionary the 1920's were with the country taking on a whole new sense of looking, feeling, and reacting in the crazy economic bubble that followed the horrors of World War I. It's satisfying, entertaining and goes by fast. Just don't expect too much of it.	2003-06-04

His work as a Milton expert at an elite school in early-1990s Botswana is really just a front for his real job, that as a contract agent for the CIA. He loves this job, and he also loves his handler. And you had better love Ray, because this book never gets out of his head. <br />Unfortunately, it is hard to love Ray. His level of self-absorption is extraordinary.  In his adoration of Iris he wants her to exist only for him. When she seeks the help of a counselor for depression, Ray decides that she's having an affair with the man-she must be because his obsession with her should be enough to make her happy. He tries to get his creepy new CIA station chief to let him compile a file on the counselor, an African-American new to Botswana. The chief wants Ray to focus his attentions on a Botswanan recently returned from England whom Ray sees as not only harmless, but rather admirable. Ray begins to seethe. <br />And what does Ray do to help himself assimilate all these changes? He talks. Dear God, does he talk. Everyone in \\"Mortals\\" talks far too much. Ray and Iris indulge in these unbelievably boring talk-fests that I advise you now to skip if you want to survive the trek to \\"Mortals\\" last page.  Neither of these people is interesting enough to make half, even a third, of what they have to say compelling, especially since Iris exists only through Ray's limited vision. Once Ray gets sent on a mission in the bush-and away from Iris-things pick up. Then the talking goes on entirely in his head, but it is tempered by your hope that something is actually going to happen. <br />\\"Mortals\\" works when it talks about African politics, history, customs, or traditions. You want to know more about the African characters, while you wish the expats would just shut up. The last third of the novel gels (Ray is literally gagged for part of it), but this is still a highly overrated and overhyped  work that needed an editor's machete. At half the length, Norman Rush could have gotten his point across without taking advantage of the goodwill of readers who have waited more than ten years for a follow-up to \\"Mating.\\"	2003-06-03

I am giving \\"The Blind Man of Seville\\" one star, but I could just as easily have given it five for the successful realization of a thriller. The thing is that the plot, the graphic scenes of torture, and the angst of the characters gave me nightmares. I tried to stick with it to find out what happened to the child Arturo, or what caused the victim such horror at the time of death, but considering what had happened so far ,did I really want to know? No. I put \\"The Blind Man of Seville\\"  down.<br />This is the most unsettling book I have read since \\"Red Dragon,\\" which I was actually able to finish. I found Robert Wilson's \\"The Company of Strangers\\" a very smart spy tale which brewed history, characterization, and deceit into a dark and satisfying result. The well-developed characters, unusual, believable setting, and high-stakes crime are all here, but the way they play out is repellent. I have never put a book down because I was too disturbed to go on.  Wilson is an excellent writer, but this book is sickening. If that is what he intended, he has succeeded brilliantly. If that's not what you're after, stay away.	2003-05-13

I have to disagree. The White Russian is an all-around better book in that it is plotted with more depth and believability than the earlier novel, and the atmospheric elements are better integrated with plot and characterization. Master of Rain was enjoyable, but The White Russian is better than that.<br />Bradby has set his second thriller to be published in the US in St. Petersburg, Russia, within weeks of the overthrow of Tsar Nicholas. It is New Year's 1917, dark and cold. There is little cheer. Russian troops are being slaughtered in World War I. Professional troops have been sent to the front, and only disgruntled reservists are left in the capital. There are food shortages, and the sense of unease is so great that some are willing to put a date to the explosion of revolution.<br />Sandro Ruzsky has just returned to Petrograd, as his city is now called, following three years of exile in Siberia. He is a detective from a noble family, which has not welcomed him home. Within a day of his return, he is on the case of two very brutal murders-a man who turns out to be an American revolutionary and a young woman who was a nanny to the Tsar's son. The search for the killer will take Ruzsky to the Tsarina's sitting room, tenements of reeking squalor, his family home, and backstage at the Imperial ballet.<br />The plot is tight and intricate without being ridiculously convoluted. The characters have meat and gristle. Within a very short time they will be plunged into terror and anarchy. It would be interesting to check in on Ruzsky on New Year's 1918 to see whether he or any of the other characters in The White Russian are still alive.<br />Although Tom Bradby does not write with the existential ache of Martin Cruz Smith, he is able to touch the underlying disquiet of a time and place. This is a very evocative and satifying thriller.nd satifying thriller.	2003-05-09

Jimmy Koprowski  comes home to Raysburg, West Virginia, after four years in the service. He spent the Viet Nam war in Guam, but he still can't get this life together. He's living at home, working at a TV repair job when he can manage to make it in.  Jimmy often spends too much of the evening drinking at the Polish American Club. The drink inflames his self-destructive tendencies, as does a nasty affair with Connie Bradshawe, a wealthy, beautiful woman who seems intent on bringing them both to grief.<br />Distraction comes in the unlikely form of Jimmy's younger sister Linda, a musician who wants to start an all-girl polka band. Since it is 1969, you might think that Linda is going to have a hard time finding musicians to play something as un-cool as the polka. Ah, that's not the case in Raysburg's Polish community, where even hippies have a good time at polka parties. My Sister's Polka Band includes Linda on trumpet, a 60-ish accordionist, one of those tattooed hippies, a non-Polish farm girl from Ohio, and a 15-year-old named Janice on the clarinet. Janice is a real talent, the daughter of Polish refugees who may be the only people in town to look down on polka music. Jimmy is drafted to ferry Janice to and from rehearsals. He is surprised to find out how much they have to talk about, and not only must he grapple with his drinking and his relationship with Connie, but with his developing feelings for a girl too young for him.<br />Jimmy is a terrific voice-unsentimental, wry, funny, and down to earth. He wants to pooh-pooh the Polish dances and church festivities, but is always willing to admit that he can't because he likes them too much. You like him, too, and Janice, the polka band and all the neighbors who love to dance and drink beer at the Polish American Club. <br />I'm surprised that author Keith Maillard is not better known, and I was surprised to read that \\"Clarinet Polka\\" is his seventh book about Raysburg. He came to most readers' attention with \\"Gloria\\"-a book as elegantly designed as it was written. Maillard is an excellent writer who is worth discovering.	2003-04-30

As you read Eva Khatchadourians letters to her estranged husband you think this is what it must be like for parents whose child has just murdered classmates and a popular teacher.<br />As Eva reveals in her letters, she knew something was wrong with Kevin from the moment of his birth when he turned away from her breast snarling and screaming. The anger does not wane, even though outwardly he was a passive, disinterested child. She blames her own mixed feelings toward him, but her beloved husband Franklin fiercely defends the boy whenever she asks why babysitters never come back for a second time and other families go great lengths to keep Kevin away from their own children. And Eva doesnt like him. No matter how hard she tries--and she does try very hard, moving to the suburbs, staying home, none of which she wants to doshe does not like her son. <br />Since you know from the beginning that Kevin is in juvenile prison for killing his classmates, you might think that the suspense in the story will come from finding out how he planned his spree and carried it out. You would be very, very mistaken. Very late in We Need to Talk About Kevin Lionel Shriver introduces a twist that is completely unexpected and totally shocking. These are words too frequently used in describing thrillers which rarely deliver the unexpected or the shocking. Believe me, in this book, those words do not begin to describe the wallop Shriver packs in the last quarter of the novel.<br />I was unfamiliar with Lionel Shriver, and will (after a recovery period) look for her other novels. She digs fearlessly into the back of her characters minds and the bottoms of their hearts.   Read this book.	2003-04-16

He might seem a little strange to the outside world, but he's not blacking out and having days and weeks disappear. And he's got a new job with a computer firm in his small town outside Seattle.<br />So everything's going well for Andy until his sympathetic boss hires a new programmer who also has MDP. Unlike Andrew's orderly house of souls, Penny's \\"society\\" is in complete chaos. Thrown for a loop, Andy's most destructive soul takes over and Penny and Andy are on the roadtrip from hell to take on the demons of Andy's past in his small Michigan home town.<br />The first two-thirds of \\"Set this House in Order\\" are wonderful. Hearing Andy describe how he gets ready in the morning (different souls take on the various elements of the morning toilette) is a kick. But the final third becomes so frenetic that the sympathy and affection set up in the beginning to the novel begins to unravel. Considering what Matt Ruff has set up throughout, is this kind of denouement really necessary, or is it an attempt  to tie everything up in a manner that will appeal to more mainstream readers? I was sorry to see the book go in this direction, but nonetheless, &quot;Set This House&quot; is highly recommended.	2003-04-15
US	52397641	R1YPG8V3LL1JBG	0375410562	825048489	Monkey Hunting	Books	4	9	13	N	N	Hungry ghost	Cristina Garcia gathers the Cuban-Chinese experience up in her graceful embrace in this lovely novel that covers more than a century and a familys adventures in Cuba, China, the US, and Vietnam. This is a slim book to take in so much, and I was left wanting more, more, more.<br />Garcia is an elegant writer who creates characters you immediately like and care about, and then doesnt give you enough to leave you happy. The most satisfying section of Monkey Hunting is the first part, where Chen Pan leaves his village to make his way in the world. He ends up a slave in Cuba, cutting cane until he escapes and through hard work and luck sets up a second-hand shop called the Lucky Find. He marries a former slave, and a dynasty is born. Chen Pan and. Lucrecia are wonderful creations, and the world of Havanas Barrio Chino is so filled with fascinating Chinese Cubans that it would be a pleasure to stay there awhile and really get to  know them. However, we seem to be only touching down here and there, never lighting very long in one place. Chen Pans granddaughter Chen Fang gets especially short shrift, a shame because as a woman who is raised as a boy, becomes a teacher and a secret lover of women, and ultimately a victim of the Cultural Revolution, her story is certainly an interesting one. And what about Domingo Chen, who flees Castros Cuba to come to New York and go to war in Vietnam? A great story. Tell me more.<br />Monkey Hunting could easily be twice as long and still maintain Garcias high standards. In this shorter format she packs her prose beautifully, telling us a great deal with little. She undermines herself by being so good at imagining characters that the reader longs for more details, situations, and background than she seems to be willing to give.	2003-04-15

Nancy Clark has written a cheerful comedy of manners that sustains its humor and high spirits from first page to last. \\"The Hills at Home\\" neatly combines good writing, appealing characterizations, and shrewd observations into a novel that has plenty of depth and enough highs to keep readers happily squeezed into the dinner table at the Hill's for the duration of one very particular year.<br />Retired teacher Lily Hill lives in the decaying Hill family home in the town of Towne, somewhere in New England. Relatives crowd in for the summer-her crusty but romantic brother Harvey, her niece and teen daughter fleeing Mom's Midwestern marriage, a former Wall Street nephew, his wife and four adolescents, a wanna-be comic great nephew and his West Virginia girlfriend-and none of them go home. It is 1989, the Berlin Wall is falling and unstable domestic economics have put a number of Hills on the outs. No one has told Lily they will be staying, they just do. And Yankee hospitality requires that she take it all in stride, even when a sociology student arrives to observe a WASP family in their natural element.<br />The Hills are all quirky and believable, notably the teenagers who are charming and exasperating in equal doses, and the book will make you laugh out loud. Author Clark is such a confident writer that it is hard to believe that this is her first novel.  The good news is that she is at work on another book about the Hills, and considering where she's left them at the end of \\"The Hills At Home,\\" it's bound to be a doozy.	2003-04-09

Those are the sort of readers who will be bored stiff by this novel's cardboard characters, cornball plot, and melodramatic writing. \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is rife with factoids about Church history, the symbolism of the pentacle, Opus Dei, and Fibonnaci numbers which are pretty interesting and propel the plot for awhile, but showing off tidbits of knowledge is no substitute for actually creating believeable fiction.<br />This book will work better as a movie (its obviously intended purpose) when actors can flesh out the characters, a director can create some atmosphere, and the factoids may sound profound and less like a lecture. More intelligent, more fun, and more exciting time can be spent rereading \\"Gospel,\\" or discovering that big juicy book for the first time.	2003-04-07

In The Coffee Trader, its Portuguese Jews and the 17th century Dutch commodities market. Whats intriguing about both books is that these are rare settings for suspense novels and that both books offer cultural, religious, and economic opportunities for labyrinthine plotting.<br />Like other Jews in Amsterdam, Daniel Lienzo came to Holland for the religious freedom he was denied in Portugal. Religiously-tolerant and business-savvy Holland would seem like just the place for adventurous Jews to fit in. There are differences, of course. While the Jews dress in bright colors, they have their own religious police that keep an eye on everyones business and behavior. The Dutch may wear black, but men and women enjoy a degree of freedom the Jews find uncomfortable. So when Daniel receives a tip from a Dutchwoman about coffee--a commodity little known in Europe--he is not quite sure how to take it. He has had several ruinous business failures and needs a big success fast. He accepts some sample coffee beans and thinks the deal over. <br />Before you know it, coffee is working its addictive powers on a number of people, especially his sister-in-law, who finds the bitter beans give her the courage to give voice to her feelings. Daniel discovers that what the Dutchwoman told him is true: as opposed to commonly drunk beer or wine which make you torpid, coffee gets you rarin to go and gives you that competitive edge. <br />You can imagine what kind of effect raw coffee beans would have on the virgin system. As Daniel begins to have one menacing conversation after another, it is hard to tell whether theres real danger involved or whether hes just flying close to paranoia on caffeine. The Coffee Trader works well in its descriptions of a time, place, and culture, but less well as a coherent mystery. Lisss depiction of commodities trading is lively and interesting, but his creation of characters is less so. There is really no one to like except the sister-in-law, a woman who was raised Catholic until her wedding day when she was told that she was actually Jewish and that she and her new Jewish husband were leaving Lisbon immediately to live in Holland. Daniel is too much of a manipulator, too false to like. Most of the other characters are too shifty to care about. Lacking a sympathetic center, the novel becomes tiresome with too much convoluted back-alley conniving.<br />David Liss should have dropped the mystery element and written a straight novel. Hes certainly got the knack for choosing fascinating historical settings. Hes got the skill to bring them to life. This book would have been much more satisfying as a novel about Portuguese Jews making their way in 17th century Amsterdam than it is as a thriller.	2003-03-31

O'Rourke, anyone who think it's one world haven't had to use a foreign bathroom  recently. It's that same spirit that I like about Paul Theroux: he hitchhikes, he paddles, he takes the train, he hangs off the side of a bus, he goes to all sorts of rare places and tells us exactly what they are like. In  \\"Dark Star Safari: Overland from Cairo to Cape Town,\\" he returns to Africa for the first time since leaving in the late 1960s, and his journey is as riveting and his reportage as merciless as any writing he has done.<br />Paul Theroux  was in the Peace Corps in Africa in the early 1960s until he was ejected from the Corps for giving a member of  an opposition  political party a ride to neighboring Uganda. That same friend--who later became Malawi's ambassador to the United Nations--got Theroux a job at the college where he had become headmaster. Theroux stayed there as a professor until leaving Africa in the late '60's.<br />Having left so much of Africa hopefully poised for independence and rebirth, he returns to travel through one ravaged kleptocracy after the next; countries where the most common greeting to foreigners has become \\"give me money.\\" And why shouldn't they expect another handout? Aid programs abound, pouring billions of dollars, or francs, or marks into countries where the people seem unable to lift a finger to help themselves. Everything, everywhere, is filthy. Foreign doctors work in hospitals for low salaries that African doctors refuse to accept. Theroux is approaching 60 years old on this trip, a milestone that so few Africans reach  that many people cannot conceive of the number being connected with age. What happened here?<br />The saddest chapter in \\"Dark Star Safari\\" is when he visits the college where he taught in Malawi. Once a  beautiful place that educated many of the country's shining lights, it is now broken-down and filthy. The books in the library that was once a pride of the nation have been stolen or torn apart. The old students Theroux meets admit that it a tragedy, but none of them have done anything to change it.<br />And that is his revelation on this trip--only Africans can help Africa. Why they are not is fodder for another book altogether. <br />This book is hard-hitting good reading. And as always with Theroux, you will find yourself  hitchhiking and hanging off the side of the bus in his excellent, tough-minded company.	2003-03-18

Drop City is Norm Sender's commune outside of Santa Rosa, California. Actually, Drop City is a commune wannabe; at this point it's nothing more than a crash spot for a fluid population of counter culturists who come by, do a lot of drugs, groove on the free love, and wander on down the road when they need a real meal or a serious wash. Over time a core group has formed which includes the 40-ish Norm, Star and Marco. Star is smart even when she's stoned, and Marco is the only guy--pardon me, cat,--who actually does any physical work to improve things at Drop City. \\"It's all about the chicks,\\" one cat says. Yep, it is up to the women to cook, clean, wash, and offer themselves freely to the men. If any  female ever wakes up and realizes that the emperor has no clothes, Drop City will fall apart. <br />That same summer, Sess Harder is on his way to town to try his luck  as one of Pamela's three suitors. She's an Anchorage woman who wants to live in the wilderness and is looking for a husband to do it with. Sess is a trapper with a cabin eight miles upriver from the closest tiny settlement, and he, and the life, are exactly what Pamela wants. She has saved herself for this.<br />Norm runs into trouble with the county and his ranch just about the same time that he inherits a cabin just downriver from Sess, and Drop City goes on the road to live off the land in northern Alaska. Obviously  this is going to be a play-pattern mismatch, and Boyle has set up that both Sess and Marco have terrible tempers and checkered pasts. Both have an enemy. The two capable women, Star and Pamela, have very different beliefs. And winter comes very early in that part of Alaska.<br />Having set up an intriguing culture clash, Boyle unspools with exquisite tension a story that does not develop as expected, yet everything plays out in a completely plausible fashion. \\"Drop City\\" workson many different levels, tickling the mind and satisfying the demanding reader.	2003-03-06

Etienne van Heerden  has woven touches of magic realism into the appealing history of the town of Yearsonend, a dusty little nowhere town on the stony plains of the Karoo, making us realize that magic realism has not run out of steam, and that in the hands of  some writers it still has the power to amaze and amuse.<br />Word of an astonishing sculpture appearing  the yard of  a local eccentric brings art administrator Ingi Friedlander from Cape Town with the aim of acquiring the piece for South Africa's new parliament houses. She is surprised when its discoverer, an impish fellow named Jonty Jack Burgh, not only refuses to sell it, he won't even show it to her. Not one to give up easily, Ingi sticks around and becomes entranced by the strange tales swirling around the tiny town which involve, among other things,  gold, a man entombed in a cave with four horses and a carriage, the decorative feather industry, and a deaf, mute, and blind former Italian prisoner of war named Mario Salviati. <br />Ingi's poking around has the whole town on edge, including the local angel--a beaky fellow who spends most of his days picking at fleas on his wing feathers.  The Yearsonenders see themselves as a closed-mouthed crew but in fact they are not, and Ingi collects a great deal of information. Might she be just be the person who has to release Yearsonend from its guilty trance? Or should she just run like hell and risk returning to Cape Town without the sculpture?<br />We don't get to read much non-topical literature from South Africa, and this novel is an interesting slice of pre-and-post Apartheid 20th century. \\"Mario Salviati\\" is a charming, touching book , nicely written, well-translated, and  different.	2003-02-14

It is hard to find a book that expresses the miracle of understanding music as well as this one. To know what it feels like to hear beyond the notes, to innately comprehend he composer's sentiment, is something most people will never realize, and in \\"The Time of Our Singing,\\" Richard Powers brings most of us mortals about as close as we'll ever get to that sublime experience. His new novel is a big, involving story of music, love, and race, three entrancing elements that lead to a good read.<br />The music element is the most successful in the Strom family saga. German-Jewish physicist David Strom meets African-American singer Delia Daley at Marian Anderson's landmark 1939 outdoor concert at the Lincoln Memorial. They marry despite her family's objections, and the children they raise grow up immersed in music. The oldest, Jonah, has talent that is undeniable. The second, Joseph, has the talent without the temperament. The youngest, Ruth, immerses herself in the black activist movement. The three Stroms grow up on an awkward place along the color line at a time when everything having to do with color was dynamite.<br />This is the most successful of Powers' novels in that it combines accessibility with his exciting strength of ideas. You can certainly pick at a few things about characterization and the placement of characters in the path of too many historical events, but overall it is a very satisfying book and a great deal of thought-provoking pleasure will be found between its covers.	2003-02-06

So why doesn't any of it work? \\"The Seduction of Water\\" is flat and lacking spark. The characters do unconvincing things, and there are far too many coincidences. There's a layer of gloss so thick that it sticks everything, motionless, to the page.<br />So why bother to review Carol Goodman's second novel? Because of those possibilities. There are so many elements that are almost there, that almost add up to a charming, funny tale with enough depth to describe it as literary. I'm looking forward to Carol Goodman's breakthrough.	2003-02-04

The first part of this novel, with its stock scenes of the noble Irish and brutish English, are, frankly, awful. Once main character Cormac O'Connor gets to New York, it gets better, but not good enough to finish. A glitch in the reading line-up caused me to pick \\"Forever\\" up again, and suddenly, on page 307, it really took off and was as good as the reviews had promised. Pete Hamill's novel has 613 pages, which puts this puts this remarkable transformation pretty much right smack-dab in the middle. What's going on here?<br />The writing in the Irish scenes is pallid; the tales have been told before and no new life is breathed into them. The revenge story it sets up is uninteresting, and even the magical horse and dog are pretty flat. Cormac's arrival in New York perks the tale up a little, but his relationship with the Africans--key to the story--never rings true. But once the story transitions from the Revolutionary War to the 1830s, everything works. Cormac is now immortal. By this time he is close to 100 in real years, yet appears to be a young man. People who've known him for years wonder why he isn't getting older. He wonders how he's going to live forever. The city and its people spring to life. The dialogue picks up. The story takes on depth and color. You are hooked in and wonder how Cormac's story will turn out.<br />So what's my advice? Start \\"Forever\\" at chapter 72? If you can soldier through the first half, the second part of the book is engaging and well done. I suppose it depends on what you have next on your reading list.	2003-01-21

There are times in You Got Nothing Coming where you will laugh out loud, which, I suppose, is better than crying. Jimmy Lerner, a 47-year-old MBA with a Dilbert lifestyle, kills a man in Las Vegas, and goes to prison for voluntary manslaughter. He gets luckyhis first cellie is a huge, tattooed, and respected recidivist called Kansas. The two get along, and Kansas protects O.G. (Old Gangstathe only reason his fellow prisoners can figure out for why a guy his age would have lived long enough to be in jail) from many of the threats of prison life. This leaves Lerner free (in a matter of speaking) to observe those around him and report on what life is like in prison for someone literate enough to tell the tale.<br />Some of You Got Nothing Coming is laugh-out-loud funny. A great deal of it is pathetic. Here is a huge institution crammed full of people who seem to come from a parallel universe. No matter what color they are, their lives are sagas of wretched beginnings and generations of poor decisions. These are frightening, yet often amiable guys. Lerner does not ask questions; he just lets his new neighbors tell their stories and hopes to high heaven that they leave him alone.<br />Stylistically, there are a few problems. The over-use of quirky prison phrases (such as you got nothing coming and that aint nothin nice) dulls their effect and gives the book the sense of being cobbled together from a series of separate vignettes, especially when theyre frequently used as kickers. Lerner apparently wrote the book in fragments, but the editor should have taken a look at how it sustained as a whole and spent more effort on transitions. The section on his crime is not smoothly integrated and  hard to reconcile with the voice Lerner has established. Nonetheless, this book is a good read, especially when you know that he was recently paroled.	2003-01-16

Ray was raised in the projects, and now he wants to give back by teaching at his old high school. He also wants to be closer to his daughter, Ruby, who lives in nearby Manhattan. But before much of any of this can happen, Ray is assaulted in his apartment and in the hospital with a crushed skull. What he is not is giving out details to Nerese Ammons, the detective who's on the case.  Richard Price takes the story from both Ray and Nerese's point of view and employs a flexible time line. Level after level of past and present are revealed to add depth, power, and real suspense to a completely engrossing and satisfying read. Price has a remarkable ear for dialogue, and knows places like Hopewell Houses in Dempsey inside and out. He is unsentimental about life in the projects. The characters are etched in such sharp relief that you know you`ve seen them somewhere.<br />It is a kind of liberation for readers to be in such capable hands that you know that whatever happens, you will not be  disappointed. There are no false steps in \\"Samaritan,\\" no easy choices, and no plays for sympathy for Ray or anyone else. It's tough, good, and a learning experience about not only about what it means to be a samaritan, but about how a really good novel should be written. Don't miss it.	2003-01-15

Set in remote areas of Canada in the late 1920s, Peter Duvett, Kala Murie, and Vienna Linn form a strange trio hooked to each other by perverse forces revealed in a manner so understated that they become even creepier.<br />Photographer's assistant Peter Duvett leaves Halifax to take a job in the remote north of Manitoba. The settlement is accessible only by plane and so small that it is hard to imagine that there would be enough customers to support any business, let alone one which would require a photographer's assistant. When Peter checks in at the hotel, there is a woman giving a lecture on spirit photographs-the \\"uninvited guests\\" whose shadowy forms have mysteriously appeared in photo backgrounds. Why is this woman giving a lecture on such an arcane subject in a settlement so tiny that there are only three people in the audience? She is Kala Murie, fiancée of Vienna Linn, Peter's new employer. It is their wedding day, an event to which Peter is not invited and from which Kala comes to Peter's bed.  With the bride as his lover and his boss as his enemy, Peter starts work. Vienna Linn, he learns, takes photos of Catholic converts for the town priest, but his real business is creating fatal accidents and taking pictures of the resulting mayhem for a wealthy British client. Train wrecks are a favorite, but planes, streetcars, and automobile accidents are acceptable as long as people die.<br />Yet watching photographic evidence of murder appear in the developing pan does not send Peter running from this strange couple. His passivity and attraction to Kala keep him in their orbit even when he knows too much. <br />The behavior of all three main characters is so strange that you cannot imagine how the story will end. Apparently, neither did Howard Norman. The climax is disappointing and there is now way this story could be resolved that simply. It negates the atmosphere that has been so carefully built up.	2003-01-14

Sanjay Nigam's captivating novel is a different take on the Indian diaspora and a fine addition to that list of good reads penned by Indian writers. Sonny Seth is a resident in a large hospital in New York City's Little India. Sonny's a pretty straightforward guy--an Indian-American from Arizona, a gifted physician--except that he sleepwalks nightly around the neighborhood dressed only in boxer shorts and shoes no matter what the weather. Sleeping the night through is an issue with many in Little India, meaning that Sonny is one of the few people who doesn't know about his pre-dawn strolls. <br />The Transplanted Man is one of Sonny's patients. He is an Indian politician who is in terrible condition and whose failing body has been patched together by a series of organ transplants. After seven of these procedures, his body now contains a vital organ donated by someone from each of India's major religions, which has turned out to be an enormous advantage in a nation as divided as that one. His prayer is that, because he can now truly represent all Indians, he will be able to make amends for his corrupt past.<br />Sonny's co-workers are a bizarre lot, the patients are even kookier, and the neighbors may be the nuttiest of all. There's an engineer who has chomped a hunk out of his wife's buttock, a psychotherapist who finds himself playing a New Age guru in order to make a living, and a scientist who can't sleep seeking the cause of insomnia.

Thirty years later they still make me laugh out loud and marvel at how surprising they are.<br />The element of surprise is the key, and what I've always felt Harry Potter lacked. Eager's kids are regular kids--just like the reader and her or his friends--who stumble across some thing or other that turns out to be magic. The children can control the magic thing, but first have to figure out exactly what it is, how to make it work for them, and what the catch is because there is always a catch. In the meantime all sorts of goofy stuff is going on all around them and they've got to corral the magic if they want it to do something special, which they always do.<br />Most of the books feature an age-range of characters, and a good balance of girls and boys. Eager's kids are always readers(which is why such fabulous things happen to them!) and which is fun for children who are readers themselves.<br />Any kid with a sense of humor and a yen for surprises will love these books.	2002-11-27

It is very well-written, with believable, enjoyable characters, credibly set in a small Mississippi town. There are echoes of fine Southern writers and even Jane Austen, although Tartt's voice is entirely her own. Shouldn't this be enough?  Apparently not, and as a result \\"The Little Friend\\" is unsure whether it is supposed to be a coming of age story or a mystery.<br />You've got to love the layering of the first sentence: \\"For the rest of her life, Charlotte Cleve would blame herself for her son's death because she decided to have Mother's Day dinner at six in the evening instead of noon, after church, which is when the Cleves usually had it.\\"  Harriet Cleve Dufresnes wants to find out what happened to the brother whose Gothic death caused her family to unravel. Harriet and her friend Hely decide that Danny Ratliff (whose family has perhaps one complete set of teeth between them; they drive rattling trucks; they know guns, you know they type) was the culprit and they stalk him. This takes up precious little of the book and ends in an overwrought scene atop the town watertower. This is about the least interesting thing about \\"The Little Friend.\\" It would have been more satisfying to put that energy into Harriet, her family, and how they function in their time and place in the world.  <br />I was not a fan of \\"The Secret History,\\" which I felt was immature and so lacking in narrative focus that I forgot that there was supposed to be a mystery going on. Editors and reviewers seemed to be so blown away by Tartt's youth and beauty that they failed to do their jobs in helping her grapple with the novel's shortcomings. This novel has the same problem. Donna Tartt is a talented writer and this is an enjoyable book but it could havebeen much more than that.	2002-11-19

Shortly after the opening of Japan to the west, young Lord Genji is sent to the docks of Edo to greet three Christian missionaries. Most of his countrymen see the outsiders as repugnant and their ideas as ridiculous, but Genji intuitively understands the influence they will have on his country's future. <br />The missionaries are a strange trio who bring their own load of intrigue. Matthew Starke is an ex-gunslinger-at least he says it's a former profession. Emily's beauty has only brought her grief in the United States, and she feels liberated by how ugly the Japanese find her. Zephaniah, their leader, is on fire for Christ but not Emily, even though she is his fiancée. Genji and the beautiful geisha Heiko are thrown in with the missionaries at first because they allegedly speak English (although no one is more amused than they to hear the difference between their book-learned language and the way people actually talk); and then because of the threat they all face from factions attempting to overthrow Genji's ancient clan.<br />Author Takashi Matsuoka writes with confidence and verve, creating lively, intricate characters whom he places in exciting situations. A great deal of history is imparted, neatly meshed into the narrative, and both Japanese and American characters are fully realized. Nice touches of cross-culture influence are provided in the form of an American who has become a Buddhist monk, and a samurai whose life is transformed by the concept of the pursuit of happiness. \\"Cloud of Sparrows\\" is an excellent addition to the historical adventure genre.	2002-10-23

Himself? Or just this movie star's autograph?<br />\\"The Autograph Man\\" gets off to a good start, with a flashback of Alex-Li and two friends being taken to a wrestling match at the Albert Hall by Alex-Li's dad. It is a fateful trip for several reasons: first, Alex meets the boy who will turn him on to autograph collecting and thus set him on his professional path. Second: Alex's father dies of a massive heart attack shortly after the match between Big Daddy and Giant Haystacks is over. This prologue contains the dead-on dialogue and offbeat cultural observations that  Zadie Smith writes so well. It is exactly like spending too long in the car with three precocious thirteen-year-old boys. One is a classic urban Jewish kid, another is a black African Jewish kid, and then there's Alex-Li, a half Chinese Jewish kid. The fact that Alex-Li's dad, a man you like immediately, has offered to take these three to a wrestling match ranks as one of those truly selfless acts of a parent's love.<br />Zap to the present, where, as one character puts it, the best and the brightest work on the fringes of the entertainment industry. Alex-Li is now a full-time Autograph Man. That arcane industry is cunningly limned, but truth to tell, it is very hard to care about these self-absorbed characters now that they are adults. That they are frequently drunk or stoned adds to the sense of disaffection experienced by them and unfortunately the reader as well. There is some Jewish mysticism stirred in for spice, but ultimately \\"The Autograph Man\\" never comes together. Besides Alex's father, only the movie star turns out to be someone you can care about.<br />\\"White Teeth\\" garnered many literary prizes and \\"The Autograph Man\\" is unlikely to capture any. That's okay. Consider this a phase. Zadie Smith's next book will still be worth looking forward to.adie Smith's next book will still be worth looking forward to.	2002-10-04

Kevin Baker, whose \\"Dreamland\\" made its strong and haunting appearance several years ago, follows up with another excitingly researched and characterized novel. Set during the five hot days of the New York City draft riots of 1863, \\"Paradise Alley\\" traces the lives of three women living on that street waiting for terror and anarchy to reach their doors.<br />Ruth, Dierdre, and Maddy are all Irish, struggling in a hard city that is nonetheless better than what they left. Dierdre and her family are the closest to achieving a form of middle class stability, yet she is the one who brings hell to her own door. Her former sister-in-law Ruth is a ragpicker. Now married to a runaway slave, Ruth came to New York with Dierdre's psychotic brother, whom they hear has been released from prison and is on his way back to town. Maddy, once the mistress of the journalist who tells part of the story, now opens her bedroom to all comers.<br />Baker fills \\"Paradise Alley\\" with rich details about the lives of mid-19th century Irish immigrants-their social clubs, their pride in their firefighting teams, the gangs, the church, and the backbreaking work. This is all wonderful stuff, especially his descriptions of the fire teams with their traditions and colorful names. <br />This is a nice big book, packed with compelling characters, intriguing historical detail, and plenty of suspense. Baker orchestrates his novel masterfully, keeping all the themes twisting and twining until the novel reaches its climax. This is one of the best evocations of Civil War-era New York I have read, and it joins Peter Quinn's \\"Banished Children of Eve\\" as an outstanding fictionalization of five terrible days in U.S. history.	2002-10-04

Lala Reyes is the seventh child of the family and the only girl. They live in Chicago, where her dad and his two brothers run an upholstery shop. There are cousins (my favorites are three brothers named Elvis, Byron, and Aristotle), looong caravan-style car trips to Mexico City to visit the Awful Grandmother, and some snooping into the past by Lala. <br />The Awful Grandmother was once a girl called Soledad, whose father was a dyer of rebozos, the traditional Mexican shawl, and whose mother was renowned for her intricate knotting of the fringes. All that remains of their art in the family is a rebozo with unfinished fringes, a caramelo, a shawl dyed in stripes the colors of caramel, licorice, and vanilla which appears around the shoulders of generations of women.<br />The plot winds and circles, often ending up in surprising places. &quot;Caramelo&quot; is a long book, but it could have been longer--many of the minor characters are unfinished and there's a sense that Cisneros had such a wealth of stories to tell that she simply could not stuff them all between these covers. The writing is so bright and fine I would have been happy to spend another hundred pages with the Reyes family.<br />My sole quibble with &quot;Caramelo&quot; is the extensive use of Spanish words and phrases. If readers do not speak Mexican Spanish, will they miss the full flavor of the novel? Would we be as willing to accept a book peppered with this much Hungarian or French? I would hate to think that some readers would find this a turn-off and feel excluded from Sandra Cisneros' rich and delightful story.	2002-10-01

Keep your wits about you; you will need them.\\" What a fine opening to a big, juicy novel that delivers hours of enjoyment. Michel Faber's writing is marvelous and his choice of the anonymous, omnipotent narrator is different and intriguing. However, let me warn you that despite its literary language, \\"The Crimson Petal and the White\\" still occupies that uneasy middle ground between \\"My Secret Life\\" and a paperback with Fabio on the cover.<br />Sugar is the kind of girl who is willing to satisfy the \\"special tastes that can't be satisfied by the ordinary girl,\\" as one of her colleagues puts it. William Rackham seeks her out, based on a listing in a naughty little book called \\"More Sprees About London.\\" Sugar is indeed no ordinary girl; she is intelligent, literate, and very skilled in her profession. In Rackham she sees someone whom she can convince to set her up in a flat for his exclusive use. He does, and thus begins Sugar's conundrum. She has her own beautiful apartment and lovely things she never dreamed of, but now Rackham must work so much to maintain her that she rarely sees him. She is stuck waiting, afraid to leave the house for fear that he will show up and she won't be there. Her solution: take a position in Rackham's own house as governess to his lonely daughter.<br />This is where \\"The Crimson Petal\\" drops from five stars to four. It is hard to swallow that a 19th century gentleman would allow a prostitute anywhere near his home, let alone to move in and take over the education of his child. Sugar is smart and a quick study but it is very unlikely that no one from that class-bound time and place would catch a whiff of the streets off her. Fanny Hill does not fit Jane Eyre's job. This unconvincing twist spoils the balance between grand guignol and realism Faber has so carefully set up, and tone of the remaining pages is off.<br />But the writing and the narration trick carry you along despite skepticism about this choice of plot twist.Faber luxuriates in language and loves the sort of detail that makes a time and place tangible. And I loved the way that we as readers had certain facts about various characters-things that neither they nor anyone around them could ever know--whispered in our ears by the mysterious narrator and thus found our view of those characters transformed. Very neat. <br />\\"The Crimson Petal and the White\\" is well worth your time. It is only because Michel Faber set the bar so high that the novel is not a complete success.	2002-09-12

I came across it at the British Council library in Mexico City, and was also deeply effected. I think of it often, and it really came to mind after reading John Lanchester's \\"Fragrant Harbor\\" which seems very soft edged next to \\"Hiroshima Joe\\".<br />You can really feel Hong Kong in this book--and not the usual high end of the city where you would expect to find an Englishman like Joe. He is clinging to the very edge of the respectability that his Englishness gives him, and the fact that others know how close he is to falling gives him a scary vulnerability. He has lost all face. He is an addict and a thief, and his loss of control leads him to abuse the only person he can imagine is weaker than he is--a child.<br />Taken prisoner by the Japanese during the siege of Hong Kong, Joe never goes home when the war is over. Martin Booth so convincingly sets up Joe's past that we ache for him as he is now. <br />Booth builds up real suspense in telling Joe's story, something that few novels manage these days when you have no doubt that the protagonist will triumph for the sake of the sequel. Joe is threatened from so many different sides that you cannot imagine how his story will end.	2002-08-09

It was readable enough, but I was never fully engaged and I found the modern-day muckraking journalist subplot unconvincing and unecessary--almost as if John Lanchester had been persuaded to include it as a way to make the book appeal to readers who might mistake a reporter named Dawn Stone for Danielle Steele.<br />The descriptions of Hong Kong are very fine, though, and Tom Stewart is an interesting, if disaffected, character. There's some nice stuff in &quot;Fragrant Harbor&quot;, but for a truly exciting and wrenching book about Hong Kong, I would recommend Martin Booth's &quot;Hiroshima Joe.&quot;	2002-08-09

Readers who have never before picked up one of her books are in for a treat.<br />In &quot;Blood Doctor&quot; she juggles a mystery in history, the end of an era in the House of Lords, and modern fertility issues with great depth and sensitivity. Martin Nanther is dealing with all of these. A biographer and hereditary peer, he is beginning to research the life of the physician anscestor who earned the peerage for the family. The historical mystery theme is a popular one in current literature, but Vine plays her story out so beautifully, offering fascinating vignettes on Victorian and Edwardian life, hemophilia, period medical practice, and one man's life as expressed through the minimal entries in his diary that the book is hard to put down. The intertwining stories of the House of Lords and our un-Victorian challenges with fertility are equally engrossing.<br />Vine covers no new ground with &quot;Blood Doctor&quot; but who cares? You might even figure things out before the end of the book. But no one would dream of putting this book down before reaching the last page. Her writing is marvellous, and she sets the gold standard for nuanced psycological insight into her characters from the past and present. This novel comes close to my favorite of her books, &quot;No Night Is Too Long.&quot;	2002-07-12

The young characters have flocked there to see what they can get out of a new world, a world where the fall of communism has created societies that are more open than they may ever have been. They all wish they'd gone to Prague, the real Mecca of the early '90s, but they didn't. They're in Budapest, and although they yearn for the Czech capital continually, like Chekhov's three sisters pining for Moscow, they stay where they are.<br />John, Scott, Charles, Emily, and Mark think they know it all, but of course, they know nothing. They have a remarkable opportunity laid out before them but their lack of compassion and life experience renders them incapable of seeing or appreciating any of it. They cannot comprehend what the Hungarians have been through or their desperate hope that this future might be different from their harsh past. Arthur Phillips describes them with a seeming empathy which is creepier than if he had lambasted them.<br />Here's the rub. Although I did not like this novel at all, I suspect that Phillips wrote exactly the book he set out to write, and that the characters make his skin crawl, too. He's good. It's just that with a decade's hindsight, I found the adventures of his amoral quartet shameful. Which might be what he intended.	2002-07-10

Their passionate affair is interrupted when Anne is called back to the U.S., where her mother has been diagnosed with cancer. After a miserable time with her touchy family, Anne returns to Burundi and an outbreak of ethnic violence that leaves thousands dead, including many members of Jean-Pierre's family. She also hears some frightening rumors about his past, which make her question her future with this man she deeply loves.<br />Anne never develops into much more than someone who is very much in love. She does not seem to be someone well enough rooted to the ground to command the position of protagonist. Jean-Pierre is passionate and that's about it. You begin be get interested in Anne's friendship with his sister and that plug is pulled. The Burundi scenes do not seem very real and the Burundian characters are stuck to the page. <br />On the other hand, many of the Sonoma County scenes, especially the ones with Anne's mother, leap off the page and, boy, do you understand why Anne prefers the Third World.  But then again, that lack of connection. Her family owns apple orchards, but they might as well own a hardware store for all the shading that adds to the story. The orchards seem to exist merely for Anne to parrot to a sister that in Burundi apples cost some appalling price per pound.<br />&quot;The True Sources of the Nile&quot; earned some early buzz and a big advance. Good for author Sarah Stone! This suggests that she will have the chance to write again. She's got the talent, and I'm sure her next effort will be more complete.<br />If you want to read a truly heartbreaking book about the Tutsi/Hutu horrors, pick up Philip Gourevich's &quot;We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will be Killed With Our Families	2002-06-04

He is a devout Catholic from a wealthy Cuban family living in Paris whose name puts him in Buchenwald. Levis is something of an innocent genius, a large man who loves women (and possibly men), a composer of beloved popular songs who flees his island home for Europe when his lyricist and best friend is murdered by the Cuban government. He never stops longing for his home, but does not return until the end of the War, when both he and his country are much changed.<br />Hijuelos presents rich scenes from the musical theater of the 1920s and 30s, and uses Levis' celebrated tune \\"Rosas Puras\\" to show how Cuban music was embraced around the world. His scenes of Cuban homelife and friendship in the early 20th century radiate with warmth and nostalgia for a time when people were so important to one another. The composer's love for the wise, talented, and compassionate Rita Valladares, his love of his country and his art make him an entrancing character. This is a beautiful book.	2002-05-31

They are secretly sent to Los Alamos to give the scientists some yucks before testing the A-bomb! But off-stage they are disgusting and are surrounded by people who are pretty much the same. So why is \\"Funnymen\\" so entertaining?<br /> Author Ted Heller uses an oral history format to tell the tale of this famous team, which works. Their career is reported by a variety of pals from the old neighborhood, fellow Catskills comics, thugs, tarts, agents, spouses, and more. Nobody likes these guys, but they all ride on their coattails. And what a ride it is. When Vic Fountain and Ziggy Bliss catch sight of each other for the first time, they recognize fellow travelers. Vic may be a handsome crooner and Ziggy an brillo-haired zany comic, but they immediately see in each other someone missing that spark of empathy that makes a human being. On stage, they perform with an uncanny rapport. Off stage, they barely speak.<br /> Fountain and Bliss are supposedly based on Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis in what some consider to be the golden age of comedy. Heller catches the whole rude, crude crowd, who are often funny in ways they'd never guess.

Much of \\"April Witch\\" takes place after Ella's stroke when the girls are separated and go on to lead their own lives. Christina becomes a doctor, Margareta a physicist, and Birgitta a battered, drug-addicted alcoholic, but none of them know about Desiree, yet.<br />We don't get to read many novels set in the Sweden of the `50's and 60's, and Linda Schenk's excellent translation makes you realize that there must a worthy collection of Swedish fiction we never get to see. \\"April Witch\\" is an intelligent, unusual, deeply felt story that should find an appreciative readership here in the U.S.  My only quibble is that the April witch conceit is not fully played out, and actually isn't very necessary. Desiree is already linked to Ella and her sisters through real life-the doctor she loves was a boarder at Ella's house at the time of her stroke, Christina is a doctor in her facility, and Ella ends up on a respirator right down the hall from daughter. It's an interesting nuance to the story, but the tale of this family of women tossed together by chance is compelling enough without it.	2002-04-23

They will fight on different battlegrounds throughout \\"The Company\\"--Berlin, Hungary, Cuba, Afghanistan--until communism collapses.<br />In many ways, \\"The Company\\" is a standard spy thriller, with ample supply of the requisite secrets, double-crossing, and triple agents. There's an unnecessary Alice in Wonderland theme throughout and some clunky writing. But what makes the book stand out is not just the skill Littell brings to the plot, <BR>but the scope. This is a history of covert activities, and because we see so many major incursions represented,  we can watch disturbing patterns develop. It seems that since WWII, the U.S. has entered a number of frays for all the right reasons and withdrawn before the matter could be resolved. \\"The Company\\" deals with the spies and civilians left dangling, and raises questions about earlier policies that may have left us vulnerable to terrorists.<br />This is a timely book that I hope will excite discussion and increase understanding. If readers don't agree with Littell's take on events, then I hope they'll do research on their own. \\"The Company\\" should encourage readers to take a look at the past, and is a whopping good read to boot.	2002-04-11
US	52397641	R1G0V6DX3OHYW5	0060194723	941975974	Spadework	Books	2	5	6	N	N	Slapdash	Timothy Findley's earlier novel, &quot;Famous Last Words&quot; is a very strange and disturbing book. The question  is whether &quot;Spadework&quot; is a shift into a more traditional kind of storytelling for this Canadian author, or whether it is in fact stranger than anything else he's done. That's what's hard to decide.<br />As opposed to being set in Europe, where Findley always seems finds the smell of rot just below the surface, &quot;Spadework&quot; is set in Canada, in the fresh, bonnie territory of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival. Jane designs props, and her husband Griffin is a promising actor. Findley knows theater well, and the setting is one of the novel's strengths. The art of theater is lovingly explored--the building of props, the use of lighting to create an environment- all the individual elements that make the artistic whole.  <br />Ambitious Griffin suddenly leaves Jane and their son for an affair with the theatre's artistic director. Distraught, Jane is drawn to a Bell Canada lineman who disconnects her telephone, interrupting a phone call vital to the plot. Griffin gets the roles he wants for the next theatrical season and returns to Jane. She accepts him back. Does she really think anything will be the same again, or that his return can mend the destruction of their son's world? Why would she want this man back anyway when he has proven that his family is far, far down the list of his priorities? Is this an unbelievable ending, or is &quot;Spadework&quot; Findley's creepiest book of all? <br />It is my appreciation of Findley's earlier work that makes me want to give him the benefit of the doubt. The truth is that unless you put some work into coming up with alternative scenarios, this is a pretty haphazard book. It lacks the kind of quirk Findley excels at, and as a conventional novel of a family in crisis &quot;Spadework&quot; is a flop. It is a readable but mediocre outing by a writer from whom we are accustomed to getting only the best.	2002-04-08

This gives the girls something in common because the Red Guards have been making Maple's life a living hell because her father is in prison. <br />Anchee Min writes of China's Cultural Revolution with a restraint that makes the spiritual cost of such repression all the more horrific. As Maple and Wild Ginger grow, they see that the only way for them to survive is to become model Maoists, to pin all their hopes and deeds on the Great Leader. When Wild Ginger and a young man named Evergreen discover emotions that have no place in the Chairman's little red book, all three of them risk complete destruction. <br />Don't be deceived. Min leaves no doubt that this will not be a \\"triumph of the human spirit\\" story in the way most will expect it. In fact, the human spirit may not triumph at all. But you will keep reading, your heart aching for these girls, their young friend, and anyone who has to pass through this kind of daily gauntlet in order to survive.<br />Anchee Min's last novel, \\"Becoming Madame Mao\\" was a bestseller and a fine piece of work. But my favorite is her first novel, \\"Red Azalea,\\" which broke new ground with its straightforward description of an ordinary girl during the Cultural Revolution. Min knows that there is no need to elaborate on these stories; simply relating them as if they were the most ordinary thing in the world is more devastating than embellishment.	2002-04-07

Bruce Wagner understands what the Dickensian appellation actually means-to expose the ordinary reader to worlds so completely new that they might as well be on different planets.  In  \\"I'll Let You Go,\\" the reader meets not only the desperate indigent, but also the out-of-sight rich.  To most of us in the middle, either of these worlds might as well be on Mars.<br />Wagner's Pip, (or David, or Nicholas) is Tull, son of the daughter of the 18th richest man in America.  He stays at his grandfather's fairy-tale estate with his drug addicted mother and two cousins. One of his cousins is hideously deformed but brilliant, and the other is an equally brilliant, funny girl who sees herself as a writer and makes things happen. By happenstance, they meet Amaryllis, a homeless girl who clicks with them. But before Amaryllis can be safely woven into their world, fate whisks her away on a nightmare journey.<br />One of the most appealing thing about this novel is that the children are treated equally. Tull and his cousins are not demonized because they are rich, nor is Amaryllis sainted because of her heartbreaking background. \\"I'll Let You Go\\" is full of quirky, interesting characters, surprising plot twists, and elegant prose. It is not a party-trick book, where the author shows off by demonstrating how many links he can make between Dickens' London and Tull's L.A. It is an affecting work with enough deep emotion, humor, and surprises to keep you hooked from start to finish.	2002-03-06

Hippolyte Webb is a travel writer, and a sometime explorer and naturalist, a man who seeks adventure and manages to do it without having a telephone. He's at home in his leaking Vancouver apartment (he labels all the water stains as if they were exotic lands) wondering what to do next. He reads about the Auroras, a trio of islands near the Falklands which some people say exist and others say do not. He'll go find out! And he does.<br />Little does Hippolyte know that journeying into the south Atlantic looking for elusive islands after too few sailing lessons will only be the beginning of the adventure. He has a buyer for the story of his travels, which means that he must work with his publisher. Not having a phone, fax, or computer, he arrives, disheveled, jolly, and accompanied by strangely shaped and smelling bags and crates, to take up residence in the conference room at Rumor Press. <br />Lighthearted, intelligent, and fun, &quot;Hippolyte's Island&quot; raises questions about what is real and what isn't, and why should we care? Barbara Hodgson's writing is bright and delectable, and this novel is a winner all around. The graphic element is informative as well as fun, and adds to the overall charm of the story. Lovers of literary fiction should treat themselves to this one.	2002-01-23

There is some real eye-popping stuff here, all the more shocking because the real-life medical procedures were probably even more ghastly than author Beverly Swerling describes.<br /> Sally and Lucas Turner arrive in Nieuw Amsterdam in 1661. Brother and sister, Lucas is a barber-surgeon and Sally is an apothecary. Their hard lives have brought them especially close, so when a decision made by Lucas in the heat of lust tears them apart, they make very bitter enemies indeed. Their descendants carry the hatred on, even as each branch of the family carries on different philosophies and practices of medicine. <br /> There's a lot of interesting history going on in &quot;City of Dreams&quot;--the growth of the medical knowledge, the development of New York, and America's move toward nationhood.  There's also a fair amount of bodice-ripping, lust, exciting locations, poignancy, and new information for most readers. It reminded me of some of those big, well-crafted historical novels of the fifties and sixties. This is not lofty entertainment, but it will keep you involved until, if nothing else, the next time a character pulls out a scalpel.	2001-12-28

It is a fine piece of historical novelization as well as a fascinating antiquarian thriller. But Tobias Hill has chosen a protagonist who distances readers from her part of the story, which is too bad because what she's up to is pretty compelling stuff.<br />Katharine Sterne is after The Three Brethren, a glorious brooch once worn by Queen Elizabeth I. The search takes her to Turkey and Japan--exciting locations, beautifully described--as well as to mysterious corners of London, where two hundred years before a pair of Iraqi Jews arrived with a fortune made by finding a clay pot of priceless jewels. Are they the same jewels? How did the Iraqi brothers find them? Will Katharine make the connection? <br />The reader will care a lot more about the jewels and the brothers than about Katharine, who is much like Peter Hoeg's Smilla without the chink in her armor. She is such a cold character that  the romance Hill wrangles for her is not believable. Still there is much else to recommend &quot;For Love of Stones&quot; and Katharine actually takes up little emotional or physical space in the book. I wish that Hill had created a character as rich as that of his marvelous stones.	2001-12-28

There's the setting-World War II Lisbon, where Germans and Allies mingled socially and spied shamelessly in an unaligned city. There are the characters-complex and intriguing. There's the math (codes and ciphers intelligently and accessibly explained) and there are very high stakes-the race to develop an atomic bomb.<br />Andrea Aspinall, an eighteen-year-old Portuguese-speaking math genius is recruited as a spy in this great terrifying game. She meets German military attache Kurt Voss at a party. Their attraction is immediate will last for decades. He's a spy, she's a spy, and in fact, so is just about everybody else in Lisbon. People you would never suspect are spies in this book, and the spying goes on long after the war is over. I don't want to give anything away, but I will add that your mind will buzz with delight at this smart and swift sociopolitical thriller. <br />Only two of Robert Wilson's books are apublished in the U.S. and it would be a treat to see more of his novels available here.	2001-12-10

This book was kicking around the house for months until I finally sat down with it and was completely captivated. Why didn't I tear it out of the bag the day I bought it and indulge that very second? Idiocy? Foolishness? Enough self-recrimination. Go get this book now because it is a completely involving and totally engaging delight.<br />Other reviewers have described the book as &quot;difficult,&quot; but I would say it is a readable and fun brain tickler. Both Sybilla and her son Ludo are geniuses, so of course they do not deal with the world like us regular folk. Living in an unheated flat in London, Sybilla takes her son on epic trips around the London Underground Circle Line to keep warm.. There she engages in equally epic arguments with other passengers about whether or not it is wise for a three-year-old to be reading Greek. To earn a living she transcribes issues of oddball trade publications and watches Kurosawa's &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; over and over. Her thinking-her son will need male role models and here are seven of them. Ludo gets older and begins looking for his real father, which is as delightful, unorthodox, and heartbreaking as the rest of the book.  <br />Helen De Witt has created a weird and wonderful world. Readers may feel somewhat undereducated by this novel, but never will they feel patronized or bored.	2001-11-06

Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa's latest novel is a devastating look at the regime of Dominican dictator Omar Trujillo. In &quot;Feast of the Goat&quot; he weaves three story lines into the fabric of the story, only one of which has the intended power needed to make this book reach its full potential as a landmark piece of political fiction.<br />The sections given over to Trujillo (&quot;the Goat&quot;) himself are brilliant glimpses into the strongman's sick and frightening mind. Vargas Llosa puts us into the Goat's head and lets us experience the world of a man with total power. He finds traces of a strange humanity, something completely absent from the shadowy figures of Trujillo's repellent sons. In other words, life in the Dominican Republic is bad, but it can get worse.<br />Less successful is the modern strand of storyline, which has a woman named Urania returning to Santo Domingo after many years in New York. No matter what has happened to Urania, few readers will be drawn to her.<br />The assassins' plot storyline is jumbled, full of names the reader is apparently supposed to recognize (and due to the Latin use of double last names there seems to be a daunting number of them). The assassins are poorly defined and difficult to keep straight. Their recounting of Trujillo's abuses is grisly, but lacks the impact of the Goat's own bizarre justifications for such horror. <br />&quot;Feast of the Goat&quot; is an important book, and Mario Vargas Llosa is an important writer, not an infallible one. I wonder if editors were too intimidated to admit that everything he does is not perfect. If someone had sat down with him to clarify the assassins and add a spark of life to Uranita, this might have been one of the most wrenching books on repression to hit the shelves in a long time.	2001-11-05

The novel takes place in the 1860s, which was certainly not The Age of Reason or even AN age of reason by most people's reckoning. E.L. Doctorow apparently took author Nora Hague under wing while she was in NYU's MFA writing program with the result being a big, awkward book that I could not find a reason to finish.<BR> <BR>The problem is that while \\"high yellow\\"Aubrey's story is quite compelling, \\"high minded\\" Arabella's is not. Aubrey is a slave, and so fair skinned that he frequently passes for white whether he wants to or not. Arabella chafes at the social bondage women of her time suffer, and seeks ways to break these bonds in ways that are not very believable for her background and the time in which she lives. Hague wisely gives their situation more plausible by placing the pair in Europe. <br />We've read Arabella's story before, while Bree's is new. The stakes are much higher in the minefield of his life, and how he deals with the dangerous ambiguities of his race keep the reader on edge. There is too much anachronistic sentiment blended into Arabella's makeup to create quite the same risk and tension. It becomes tempting to skim through Arabella's sections to get back to Aubrey's.<br />If you want to read about how really stultifying 19th century women's lives were and how dangerous it was to try breaking out, open Edith Wharton's \\"The House of Mirth\\" or \\"Voyage of the Narwhal\\" by Andrea Barrett. Nora Hague's career could be interesting to watch. There are two writers represented in \\"Letters.\\" It's easy to dismiss one, but the other can write something worth reading.	2001-10-16

From the first paragraph of \\"An Affair of Honor,\\" you know you are in the hands of a master. The people who live in it, the dazzling structure that compells you from page to page, and the challenging and exciting intelligence author Richard Marius brought to the issues covered in the novel remind us of why we read fiction.<br />Richard Marius died in 1999, and it seemed that there would be ever again be anything by him to experience. His 1993 \\"After the War\\" is one of the five best novels I have ever read in a lifetime of book-loving. I envy anyone who gets to sit down with it for the first time.<br />Marius wrote about the imaginary town of Bourbonville, Tennessee. While \\"After the War\\" dealt with post World War I, \\"An Affair of Honor\\" is placed in the decade after World War II. <br />Twenty-year-old Charles Alexander leaves work late one night and witnesses a man he knows killing two people, one of them the man's own wife. Hope Kirby sees Charles and puts the muzzle of the gun to the boy's forehead. But he does not kill him. He lets Charles go after the terrified divinity student promises not to tell anyone what he has seen. The sheriff knows Charles would have been near the place of the killings at the time they happened, and the shattered young man cannot withold the truth.<br />Should he have lied? Charles, who has lost his faith and is wracked by the loss of his own innocence is not sure. Blurting out the truth to the sheriff came from someplace so deep, so organic, that it could not be held back. Yet, his heart goes out to Hope Kirby, a war hero from the back hills, and he knows that he broke the promise that saved his life.<br />Questions of truth, faith, promises, war, and madness dog all the characters in the book, who must work them out in order to go on. So confident was Marius in his characters and the compelling questions he raised that he dared to put Hope's trial in the middle of the book, if for no other reason than to show us that it was not the climax of the story at all. \\"An Affair of Honor\\" is impossible to stop reading, and then hard to stop thinking about. A brilliant novel and a fine end to an exemplary writing career.	2001-09-12

Pulitzer, National Book Award, yeah, I can imagine that. For a long time Jonathan Franzen has been sort of a writers' writer, one of those people who doesn't publish frequently but whose name keeps cropping up if you read about writing. &quot;The Corrections&quot; should bring him to a wider readership--a good thing since I cannot remember a book that broaches more complex topics in a more readable fashion.<br />The corrections the title refers to are of all kinds, the economic, personal, and mental changes that people go through in the course of their lives. In this case, every member of the Lambert family is going through some sort of correction, from dad to mom and all three of the kids. Dad Alfred is a distant fellow, now more so because of an advancing case of Parkinson's. Mom Enid has had it after years of Alfred when he was in good health, and now she is really at the end of her rope. Daughter Denise is a famous chef exploring all sorts of aspects of personal experience. The sons, feckless Chip and focused Gary might be from different planets, and Enid wants them to all gather at the old homestead for Christmas? Oi vey!<br />Franzen likes all his characters and handles them affectionately, no matter what sort of foolishness they're up to. Whether you're still struggling to find your way, have given up and are just cruising, are being squashed like a cold cut in the sandwich generation, or are picking your way through the minefield of child-rearing, it's a pretty sure bet that something in &quot;The Corrections&quot; will resonate with you. <br />There's been a lot of advance talk about this novel (notice avoidance of the word &quot;hype,&quot; which would indicate that the book isn't worth the fuss) and it lives up to the joyous pre-press. If I'm right about the prize prediction, it will be a treat to see such a fine, thoughtful, and enjoyable book rewarded for what it tells us about ourselves in this place and this time.	2001-09-05

I had not read anything by James Webb before, and admit to being a little put off by the backgrounds of the cover-blurb writers. They may be war heroes, but do they know about writing? The setting of the novel intrigued me, and I'm glad I did not let the military presentation of Webb put me off &quot;Lost Soldiers&quot; before giving it a try. The publisher might consider text praising Webb in literary as well as military terms, because he is a good writer and this is a good book.<BR>Former Marine Brandon Conley searches for missing soldiers, dead or alive, in Vietnam. The passage of time would lead him, and us, to believe that most of the lost soldiers will be dead, but a surprise is in store. Conley is lead to believe that one of these missing Americans is alive and thriving in Southeast Asia's underground economy. The soldier deserted in 1969 and killed a fellow soldier before joining the Viet Cong, so Conley would really like to catch him.<BR>Most of the action takes place in Vietnam, and it is obvious that Webb loves that country and its people. The Vietnamese characters are full of spirit, especially Conley's friend and pedicab driver Dzung and the mysterious Colonel Pham. The fact that Conley speaks Vietnamese gives us insight into the lives of the people of post-war Vietnam that is touching and thought-provoking.<BR>The Vietnamese characters are by far the most interesting. Except for his linguistic skills and kindness toward this Vietnamese friends, Conley is a fairly typical ex-Marine kind of buff, romantically wounded, Levi-wearing hero-but then he'd probably have to be to do what &quot;Lost Soldiers&quot; asks of him. He has a buffoonish anthropologist sidekick who wears Hawaiian shirts, too. They're both fine, but I wish that a little of the nuance tenderly used on Dzung and Colonel Pham had been left over for them.	2001-09-04

The novel does lack the sometimes wearying intricacy of detail found in the first two parts in theAztec series, but that is not altogether a bad thing. The mysterious author was wise to take &quot;Aztec Blood&quot; out of the Aztec universe and place most of it in the post-conquest world of the &quot;castas,&quot; or people of mixed race. There the author uses the picaresque novel form to cleverly explore as many different aspects of this society, which is new, different, and rarely written about.<BR>Cristo the Bastard is a Mestizo (half Spanish, half Indian), and as a result of his mixed race is not accepted by either group. He is raised by a friar who teaches him to read and write, but there is something mysterious about Cristo-he and the friar are always on the run from people who want to kill them both. During the course of the novel Cristo will work as a beggar, learning to contort his body and mastering the obnoxious wheedling whine that earns him extra alms. He'll also be accepted as an upper-class Spaniard, a publisher of questionable books, a silver-mine slave, a theater producer, and a victim of the Inquisition. Jennings, or whoever, draws smartly on 17th century literary sources for to create Cristo's world. The hero's boon companion is an actor, swordsman, adventurer, and playwright named Mateo Rosas de Oquedo , also the name of a real-life 17th century writer of comic verse who was a master at capturing the voices of the castas of New Spain. There is intelligent use of the works of popular period playwrights and poets (Lope de Vega, Calderon de la Barca) to flesh out the sense of what influenced the arts of New Spain. What's missing is an exact point when the novel is supposed to take place. Since the book is supposed to be written by Cristo in prison, why not simply have him date the first page of his memoirs, as most writers would do? This would anchor the action, as opposed to letting it float somewhere in the 17th century. The fact that it is set in the 17th century can only be judged by the presence of Mateo Rosas de Oquedo, otherwise it could just as well be set 100 years later.<BR>Maybe &quot;Aztec Blood&quot; is by Gary Jennings, maybe it's not, but the mystery author did a fine job of writing a lively tale which neatly touches on the issues and aspects of this part of the New World.	2001-08-30

It's hard to imagine now that this book was considered pop fiction when it was published in 1948. You'd now have to look deep into modern literary fiction to find a work as complex, nuanced, historically exciting and completely enjoyable as \\"Running of the Tide.\\" Author Esther Forbes had a fine career as a historian and novelist, winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1943 for \\"Paul Revere and the World He Lived In.\\" Her young adult novel \\"Johnny Tremain\\" still tops many school reading lists. <br />In \\"Running of the Tide, \\" Forbes turns her considerable historical skills to Salem, Massachusetts, at the turn of the 19th century. The Inmans are one of the town's oldest seafaring families, and they're facing a rough patch due to the loss of one of their ships by the eldest son, Dash. There are four Inman boys, and all but the youngest, Peter, go to sea. Dash is the most canny captain of the family, but because he lost a ship the grandmother who runs the family company punishes him by giving the captaincy of the family's beautiful new state-of-the-art ship to someone else. But there's a last minute change of plans, and it's Dash who gives the orders to hoist sail on the Victrix's maiden voyage. He asks seventeen-year-old Peter to tie up a few loose ends for him. How Peter, who adores Dash and has a serious crush on the woman Dash loves, ties up those ends entangles the family for decades. <br />The wealth of understanding Forbes brings to the New England of 1800 is a treat. The Yankee character, traditions, customs, dress, the role of women as both business leaders and \\"pretties\\", captains who can sail around the world and triple their profits but can't get across town because they can't drive a horse, new trade routes opening up, the lives on shore and on ship of people who may not see each other for years are all explored with an historian's intelligence and a novelist's panache. I first read this novel in college and have come back to it every time I need a really good, involving read. The first time I read the book it was great, but each time after that my respect for Esther Forbes has grown as I realize just how elegantly \\"Running of the Tide\\" is put together. As the book sails toward the final pages, the outcome is as inexorable and as haunting as the final scene in a Greek tragedy.	2001-08-24

ThePageTurner is bewildered about this play-pattern mismatch and hopes that it does not cost Lily Brett's good novel too many readers.<br />Ruth Rothwax is an Australian with a successful business in New York. She and her 81-year-old father meet in Warsaw for a trip Ruth has wanted to make for a long time--a trip back to her family's roots. This is really Ruth's trip, and you get the feeling that her father, Edek, is only revisiting the past for her sake.<br />Poland is awful. The people are still anti-Semitic, there is nasty anti-Jewish graffiti in every city they visit, and Krakow, where &quot;Schindler's List&quot; was filmed, has developed a thriving tourist industry out of Auschwitz, which now boasts heating and vending machines. Ruth and Edek attend an eerie Jewish cabaret with Polish performers impersonating Jews because, of course, in Poland there are no Jews left. <br />Ruth is horrified and angry at it all, but Edek, the actual survivor,  is more easygoing and forgiving about what they see. He chats cheerfully with Poles whom Ruth would like to throttle, and even enjoys the Jewish floor show.  Ruth's edgier than usual because her subconscious has been invaded by former SS Commandant Rudolf Hoess. Hoess was in charge of Auschwitz, and he has been condemned to the lower tier of heaven (there is no actual hell). In a devious twist, he cannot move up until he passes the racial sensitivity class which has been going on for the 56 years since his execution. If his conversations with Ruth are any indication, this is a placement for all eternity.<br />Lily Brett subtly notes the ironies between plush modern American or Australian life and the tough lives of people throughout Poland today. There's also the contrastor lack thereofin Polish attitudes toward Jews pre-WWII and post fall of the Wall. There are some really creepy scenes, such as when Ruth and Edek visit his family's old apartment and find things left by the family still in use. The old people who now occupy the apartment behave as rapaciously as any stereotypical Jews.<br />I wish there were some Poles in this book who were not self-righteous anti-Semites in complete denial about Poland's ugly role in the Holocaust. Both Ruth and the reader are shocked when Edek is attracted to a sprightly Polish widow with bright dyed hair and plenty of sex drivehow can this vulgar woman be the first female he wants since the death of his adored wife? And yet you have to admire him. He is a survivor, and still alive to many more possibilities in his future than his daughter is. <br />This is an interesting, thoughtful book, a deceptively smooth read.	2001-08-16

Joanna's teenage daughter and her bad-girl tentmate Dora sneak away from Girl Scout camp and stumble across a woman's battered body.  Only days later, Dora is also murdered, which makes Joanna logically fear that her daughter will be next. There are a few twists and turns in the story which will keep you going even though you have probably figured out who did it quite a bit before.<br />The location is nicely rendered, with the added nuance that, due to the rural nature of Cochise County, characters are constantly driving from one place to another. This gives Jance the opportunity for some neat place-setting touches.<br />But there is a lot of  telling rather than showing characters' feelings and motivation, and many of the minor characters are weakly developed.  In three lines of dialogue, one character goes from &quot;she said&quot; to &quot;she wailed&quot; to &quot;she whispered&quot; in what is surely an impossibly rapid rollercoaster of emotion. There is a lot of that &quot;he said boldly&quot; and &quot;she said sadly&quot; kind of writing in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; which relaxes whatever emotional grip the book might get on a reader.<br />J.A. Jance is already a bestselling author, but a good editor should be working with her to bring her writing to another level and earn her a wider readership.	2001-08-15
US	52397641	RHY7SV05PWJ8B	0385318375	327016821	Niagara Falls All Over Again	Books	5	26	28	N	N	Highly recommended	This is the story of an unlikely friendship in which Mose Sharp is the straight man indeed. A good-looking stagestruck Jewish kid from the midwest, his career is going nowhere (he comes perilously close to getting hooked off stage) until he meets fat, funny Rocky Carter, whose knockabout comic career set to take off.  Rocky sees something in Mose, and together they launch Carter and Sharp, the fat-guy-skinny-guy comedy team to beat em all. On stage and off, Mose's life is transformed by his partnership with talented, outrageous, big-hearted, demanding Rocky.  In their thirty years together that friendship will be tested at many twists and turns, and when that friendship ends the reader feels its loss almost as much as Mose does.<br /> Sorry if the first paragraph makes &quot;Niagara Falls&quot; sound pretty morose. It's not. Elizabeth McCracken balances skilfully on the tightrope between yearning and yucks to make &quot;Niagara Falls All Over Again&quot; more than a show-biz novel or a nostalgia piece. She builds on the inventive voice first heard in &quot;The Giant's House&quot; to reach one of those rare levels where although you're tickled by these guys' foibles, in the center of your chest you feel the hurt and longing behind the jokes. &quot;Niagara Falls&quot; will move you and make you laugh. What more can you ask of good fiction?	2001-08-07

It is a fine, stately novel, written with a grace and intelligence that makes it read more like an English family saga than an American one. Not surprising, considering that author Elsie Burch Donald is a transplanted southerner living in England and France.<br />There's something satisfyingly old fashioned about this book, which is refreshing in this day of the overheated Southern family saga. Characters are developed with care into surprising people, and while the plot covers a lot of ground it does so at the right pace. Donald has caught the rhythms of the long hot afternoons, the family expectations, and the maneuvering to keep up with a changing world.<br />There are plenty of unexpected turns in &quot;Nashborough&quot; and the novel will keep you engaged from start to finish. Take this book and find a good hammock. This is an elegant way to pass some late summer afternoons.	2001-08-07

The setting is 1941 Leningrad, where the two Metanov sisters live in a communal apartment with their parents, grandparents, and brother. Paullina Simons creates a vivid and believable portrait of Soviet life during World War II, which is what kept me going throughout the length of the book.<br />The two sisters fall for the same guy, army officer Alexander. Alexander meets Dasha first, but the younger Tania is the one he loves. Tania begs Alexander not to tell Dasha about their relationship because she does not want to hurt the sister she adores. <br />This could make for a pretty interesting plot, especially with these gripping war scenes that keep the tension high. Unfortunately, Dasha is such a charmless whinger that Tania's devotion to her is not credible, nor is Alexander's attraction to her in the first place. Then there's Alexander's evil friend Dimitri, and Alexander's secret, and the siege of Leningrad . . . it all turns into much of a muchness pretty fast. <br />This is too bad because the first part of the book is very nicely done, full of fine detail and excellent descriptions of the small pleasures of life in the pre-war Soviet Union. Throughout, the writing on the suffering of civilians during the war and especially during the siege is quite moving. But then the melodrama gets in the way and yanks &quot;The Bronze Horseman&quot; off its pedestal.	2001-08-02
US	52397641	R2N5UXUVJBVSSZ	0399147632	461044774	The Music of the Spheres	Books	3	16	17	N	N	Trivialized by the ending	It always worries me when a novel like &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot; is compared to mysteries by Caleb Carr or Iain Pears when a historical setting is about the only thing they have in common. More accessible than Pears' massive &quot;Instance of the Fingerpost&quot; and with more attention to historical accuracy than found in Caleb Carr, most of Elizabeth Redfern's new novel is unusual and appealing.<br />London in 1795 is the setting. Redheaded prostitutes are being murdered, and because his daughter was the first victim Jonathan Absey of the Foreign Office is after the killer. This is not what he's meant to be doing in his job, but he sees the chance to redeem himself when he suspects that the killer has ties to a French spy ring. Absey cannot infiltrate the world of French refugees but his homosexual brother Alexander can, and Alexander owes Jonathan a very big favor. Soon shy Alexander, a musician and amateur astronomer, enters a strange universe where he joins in the search for a mysterious star, where for the first time in his life he is respected and liked.<br />There are lots of elements tossed together in this novel--probably a few too many. Astronomy, spying, murder, the French Revolution, the Age of Enlightenment, deeply flawed characters, and raw and stinky London all stream together in &quot;Music of the Spheres.&quot; Redfern manipulates all these strings pretty neatly until the end. There she abandons the careful balance between the various plot elements and goes for an absurd slam-bang, over-the-top resolution quite out of keeping with the rest of the novel. Too bad. Up until that time, this had been a much better book.	2001-08-02

Just when you think you've had enough of novels about disintegrating families, there comes a book as appealing as &quot;The Yokota Officers' Club.&quot; Author Sarah Bird whisks you away to the military world of Okinawa in 1968, where Peter, Paul &amp; Mary's &quot;I Dig Rock and Roll Music&quot; passes for real rock 'n roll; where military families fear breaking an unspoken code of behavior and being RIFed, and where Vietnam is still a flicker in the background.<br />After her first year of college, Bernie Root comes home to Okinawa, the place her family happens to be that summer. Her dad's in the Air Force, and they move around a lot.  But things have changed shockingly in her year away from the family. Her parents' marriage has turned ugly, and her off-beat tribe of brothers and sisters are almost too quirky to fit in anywhere. Being back in Asia reminds Bernie of the four happy years in Tokyo, a time made special by the family's closeness and the presence of their Japanese maid Fumiko, whom Bernie and her mother loved very much. Fumiko's name is never spoken now, and Bernie wonders why.<br />She gets the chance to find out when she wins a dance contest to tour air bases in Japan with Far East Funnyman Bobby Moses, a comic whose creaking act provides pained yucks for  entertainment-starved officers clubs. His sidekick doesn't add much.  Not with Bernie squeezed into tiny go-go boots halfheartedly jiving to whatever piece of cornball music a local band can come up with. She soldiers on for the chance to find Fumiko. <br />Her discovery is surprising and disconcerting, and even more so is the role Bernie finds she played in it. Sarah Bird's portrait of Americans in 1950s and 60s Japan makes for excellent reading. Intelligent and funny, &quot;The Yokota Officers' Club&quot; will not disappoint readers who set high standards for their summer reading.	2001-06-28

It is hard for most people now to remember that Cleveland was not always the nation's most common butt of jokes about urban decay. In &quot;Crooked River Burning&quot; Mark Weingardner evokes a time not that long ago when Cleveland was a trendsetter, when its sports teams were a source of pride and joy, when it had three viable newspapers, when people were so proud of their town they couldn't imagine living anywhere else.<br />David Zielinsky grows up in a cheerful ethnic enclave, living with his aunt and uncle. His dad is a pal of gangsters,  his mother ran away to California and died. David is ambitious - he wants to be mayor of Cleveland. It could happen. He has connections to various unions as well as to organized crime (though his dad) and fighters of organized crime (through his uncle.)<br />Anne O'Connor's family is rich, powerful, and as dysfunctional as all get out. She is ambitious, too. She doesn't want to be a deb, she wants to be a war correspondent. For a society girl in the early 1950's, her dream is even more farfetched than David's. <br />Their formative years mirror Cleveland's rise and decline in the 1950's and 60's, and their disillusionment follow the city's own. Weingardner weaves in Cleveland's colorful characters, its history, issues of race, gender, family, ecology and economy, and romance. This is a strong, readable, enlightening book.	2001-06-28
US	52397641	R2KB2CU4N27X5Q	0374194114	267310153	Loving Pedro Infante	Books	3	21	25	N	N	Not the whole enchilada	To continue with the type of imagery that Denise Chavez uses so sassily in &quot;Loving Pedro Infante,&quot; this novel is like one of those burritos where the insides are tasty but the tortilla holding it all together is so flimsy that the whole thing falls apart. <br /> Tere Avila is a teacher's aid in Cabritoville, Texas, a place where there's not a lot to do but chow down at Sofia's Mighty Taco, dress up to the teeth and hang out at La Tempestad Lounge with guys you've known all your life, and attend meetings of the Pedro Infante fan club. For those who don't know who Pedro Infante is, he was the star of stars during Mexico's Golden Age of Cinema, an actor whose fine voice,  charismatic performances, and tumultuous personal life were ended by a plane crash in the late 1950's. He is adored in Mexico with the kind of following given to Elvis in the US.<br /> &quot;Loving Pedro Infante&quot; gets off to a bright and frisky start with La Tere describing a typical meeting of the fan club and the interpersonal relationships of her hometown. Unfortunately, not much develops from there. There is some broad humor (a drawn-out sequence with a diaphragm reads like something out of 1972) and a few setbacks for Tere, but she is so flippant that nothing seems to run very deep with her. <br /> The novel's appeal will be somewhat limited by the extensive use of Spanglish. Readers who do not know border slang may find it difficult to figure out what is going on in Cabritoville. Still, it is a quick, entertaining read, which I don't imagine is what the author had in mind at all.	2001-04-23
US	52397641	R3CHN2HB8PKJ5G	0375411038	593236463	Snow Mountain Passage	Books	5	17	19	N	N	Worthy	There have been so many excellent books about the 19th century American West in the past year, starting with &quot;Gates of the Alamo&quot; to &quot;The Borderlands&quot; and &quot;The Heartsong of Charging Elk&quot; (my nomination for the best novel of 2000), straight through to &quot;Snow Mountain Passage.&quot; <br />James Houston tells the story of the Donner party from the point of view of James Reed, a member of the wagon train who did not spend the winter of 1846 in the Sierra Nevadas. He had been sent on ahead, and was one of the people trying to reach the stranded families from the other side of the mountains. His frustration is excruciating as he battles for support in an area that is consumed with breaking away from Mexico. Rescue parties he mounts are turned back again and again by blizzards. Reed refuses to accept that rescuers may not be able to reach the settlers until the terrible winter is over. He knows that his family and the others cannot survive that long.<br />Survival in the freezing camp is recorded by his youngest daughter, Patty, who looks back on that winter as a woman in her 80's. Her story is told with the clear eyes of a child and the wisdom of an old woman. The fact that there were any survivors is incredible. This was an exceptionally frigid winter, and the families crammed into hastily thrown-together shacks, without heat, polar fleece, or thermals, eating anything, anything to stay alive. There was little heroism. Each group was on its own. Patty's trail diaries reveal the smell, the anger, the hunger, the despair that no one will come to help in time.<br />The desperation is heightened for the Reed family because they are one of the reasons the group did not make it over the summit before winter set in. What keeps James Reed from hero status is his hubris in building an enormous two-story wagon so his family could travel west in comfort. This &quot;Palace Car&quot; slowed everyone down, delaying the group's arrival in the Sierra Nevadas until too late in the year. The Reeds' descent from being the most envied group on the trail to the one with the fewest remaining resources makes Jim Reed even more complex, frantic to save his family from the result of his pride, yet so wrenched by guilt that he is tempted to flee south to fight the Mexicans.<br />Vivid and powerful, &quot;Snow Mountain Passage&quot; is a fine and affecting example of literary fiction, historical fiction, and plain great reading.	2001-04-04

Thorn arrives in Japan hoping to find out why his son's body arrived home without a heart, and also hopes to soothe his own guilt about not being much of a father. All he has to go on is the name of the company that send Cody's body back to the US. Since his letters to them went unanswered, Alex shows up looking for some answers himself. Gone with the Wind (they answer the phone &quot;cone wizzer window&quot;) arranges fantasy funerals - a disgusting job in Japan, which is why they've hired American Gaby Stanton. For Gaby, who lost her position as a university English teacher, this is the only employment she could find. Thorn is hoisted off on her to get both of them out of the way. <br />This is a very funny book, and it is refreshing to read an account so free of political correctness. The book's weakenss is Gaby's reason for putting up with all this in the first place. The appeal of the Japanese health care system seems quite unconvincing when Gaby's experience with the Japanese medical establishment is creepy enough to make most of us beg for an HMO. Aren't there other, less hostile places in the world where foreigners can get health care? This is the book's major flaw, especially when Gaby is offered an alternative.<br />The characters are believeable and quirky, and the English names of Japanese products are laugh-out-loud weird. This is a fun read, an enjoyable book that you will look forward to reading. &quot;American Fuji&quot; is also a glimpse into a complex, interesting, and maddening culture that we will probably never understand, and which certainly doesn't want us to.	2001-03-29

Byatt's novel did, or does it mix a modern tale with one placed in the past? Usually it's the latter, with the touted book offering a disappointing shadow of the satisfaction given by Byatt's book.<br />Nuala O'Faolain charged on the literary scene several years ago with &quot;Are You Somebody?&quot; which intrigued a lot of readers. Her first novel, &quot;My Dream of You&quot; meets everyone's expectations. It is like &quot;Possession&quot; in that it is completely engrossing, teasing, thrilling, moving, and yes, it does include a story rooted in the past. But then, for the Irish, so much is rooted in the past.<br />Kathleen de Burca is a travel writer whose carefully chaotic life is thrown in to real disorder by the loss of her dearest friend and retirement. She goes back to Ireland to research a novel on a story that's always intrigued her about an English lady's alleged affair with her Irish stableman during the Famine. Her return to the country of her birth brings her back to the land of her wretched childhood, but also throws her into a love affair which turns her upside down. <br />The characters are so well drawn that it's hard to believe they're not really in the library or behind the bar or in the shop where Kathleen meets them. Ireland, with its rich, conflictive history and wonderful contrary people comes across in all its complexities. Kathleen's physical and spiritual journey is completely involving, and this book lingers long after you've turned the last page.<br />.	2001-03-18

Her cast of characters, from the wealthiest men in the United States to factory workers, are so fully imagined that you'll be unable to leave the book without knowing whether or not they survived the bursting of the dam that had held the river back for decades.<br />Cambor does a lot of artful stage-setting, developing the reader's understanding of Johnstown's particular location and the construction of the dam through character. The beauty of the Pennsylvania mountain landscape is expressed by a young girl whose love for the outdoors makes her the only person from the lake to connect with someone from the town below. That young man is sparking the first unionization movement in the factories. His father and mother are both drawn to the town's librarian, a woman with a secret who helps prepare their son for college.<br />When the dam broke it took almost an hour for the wall of water to reach Johnstown. By the time it did, the force of the flood had dragged locomotives, houses, and corpses with it. The sound must have been terrifying and there was no where to go to escape it. Cambor's handling of the disaster is masterful; she tells you enough about the fate of her characters, but not so much as to break your heart.<br />&quot;In Sunlight, in a Beautiful Garden&quot; is a novel of complexity and grace, and it works on all levels.	2001-01-17

If I told you the plot of &quot;When We Were Orphans&quot; you would probably do as I did and run out to buy it. You can call &quot;When We Were Orphans&quot; great or god-awful, and you could probably back up your argument either way.<br />It has a terrific plot. It is just very hard to find. The characters are so remote and unemotional that they remind you of those dreams you have when you've slept too long. Suspense builds when Christopher Banks, the main character, returns to Shanghai and everyone thinks he's about to rescue the parents who vanished twenty years before. Why do they think this? Why does Banks behave as if he also expects to find them after all this time? The novel then swings into full-on realistic mode with Banks searching through buildings shattered by bombs as the Japanese army advances on Shanghai.<br />I'm one of the few who actually prefered the weird &quot;The Unconsoled&quot; to the hallowed &quot;Remains of the Day.&quot; The surreal landscape of the former was interesting until  it became frustrating, annoying, and finally, dull. &quot;Orphans&quot; suffers from much of the same irritations. Parts of it take off with terrific writing and blazing images, only to be shanghaied (sorry) by some pretentious experiment in something. I did finish the book but felt like I'd been had.	2001-01-13

I usually find the characters too patronizing, the plots too crammed with incredibly unexciting spy arcana, and the characterizations of women too weirdly 1950s for me to ever soldier on (a very Le Carre image there) to the last page. But hallelujah, the cold war's over. And after several awkward forays into a sort of half-genre Le Carre has found a new pace, and it is terrific.<br />&quot;The Constant Gardener&quot; is Justin Quayle, a midrange bureaucrat in the British foreign service whose young wife Tessa is heavily involved in relief work from their base in Nairobi. Tessa is horribly murdered and the respected African doctor she was traveling with disappears. Bits of information fall into Justin's lap about a so-called wonder drug for TB, and Tessa's research into its ultimate side effect - death. The practices of pharmaceutical companies in the Third World, the business of humanitarian aid, and roles governments play in regards to both are probed by interesting characters in a smart and smartly-paced series of events that lead to an ending that will make your skin crawl.<br />I never found much suspense in Le Carre's other books because it was so difficult to care about his characters. This book will keep you riveted from start to finish. &quot;The Constant Gardener&quot; is what I always thought a John Le Carre book was supposed to be.	2000-12-18
US	52397641	R2LNVQU9NX5EOG	0374293414	333681334	The Years with Laura Díaz	Books	4	23	26	N	N	Skim the middle and you'll love it.	Carlos Fuentes' most accessible novel in many years uses one woman's life to encompass a massive chunk of 20th century Mexican history.  Fuentes manages to place Laura Diaz at almost every important cultural and political event between 1905 and the 1970's-from pre-revolutionary hacienda life, through the building of Mexico's union movement, to the Spanish Civil War, and the massacre of students at Tlatelolco on the eve of the 1968 Olympics. This might seem like a stretch. Come on, how likely is it that any one person would manage to fit all that in as well as love affairs, a teeming family, and a friendship with Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera? <br /> Not likely at all, but Fuentes' has created a rich and readable novel, filled with many characters who exist mainly to express a political point of view but who are complex and interesting people nonetheless. The first part of  &quot;The Years with Laura Diaz&quot; works especially well, recording Laura's early years as the granddaughter of German immigrants living in the coastal state of Veracruz and the kind of life enjoyed by the families of landowners. Her marriage to a union organizer who takes her to post-revolutionary Mexico City puts her in the heart of a society recreating itself. No one writes about the Mexican capital like Carlos Fuentes, and Mexico City in the 1920's through the 70's springs to life in all its glories and maddening confusions.   <br /> There is a lot of politics, which unfortunately causes &quot;Laura Diaz&quot; to bog down as her cipher of a husband stirs an alphabet soup of labor unions and political parties. It's interesting if you know Mexican history, but I can imagine it's pretty incomprehensible if you don't. (The fascinating thing is that during this period following the Mexican Revolution, labor was delivered to a political party and not the communists, thus putting an end to the possibility of government/labor conflict for once and for all, or at least until that party was voted outof office seventy years after it was first voted in.) But once you get past that, you'll be glad you stayed with the novel to its mysterious and elegant end.	2000-10-25

Think of those old photos of Sioux Indians sitting stone-faced in Venetian gondolas or posing with Queen Victoria. What were those men thinking, warriors who until only very few years before had been riding full-tilt across the plains?  In &quot;the Heartsong of Charging Elk,&quot; James Welch imagines what it must have been like for a Sioux to travel across Europe with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show.<br />Traveling with the show was pretty fun. Charging Elk and the other young men get to show off their riding skills, chase buffalo again, and shoot up a mock homestead. When they show was over, they went home to the tipis they traveled with - just like they'd done on the plains - joked, gambled, ate, and had a good time. The strange world around them was not much of a marvel or a curiosity, and very few whites made an impression (Queen Victoria was the exception. The Indians all liked her and called her Grandmother England.) Very few spoke any English, let alone French or Italian.<br />In Marseilles, Charging Elk becomes ill and was taken to the hospital. Wit no idea that arrangements had been made for him to rejoin the show in Rome, he leaves the hospital and disappears into the city. <br />He might as well be on Mars. He has no idea what people around him are doing. He cannot speak to anyone. The French are as bewildered by him as he is by them. But he knows that what he wants is to go home.  Throughout the novel, Welch weaves Charging Elk's Sioux dream life through his days in working-class Marseilles. Will he fall in love? Make friends? Make a home in France, or find his way back to Red Cloud Agency? <br />Welch avoids the obvious ploy of making Charging Elk more noble than the so-called civilized French. He is no paragon, nor are the French universally beastly. How they get along is a paen to the adaptability of the human race.	2000-09-29

Denied the right to leave 1939 Prague  despite the fact that his family has bankrupted itself to pay the right  bribes, he makes a surprise exit to the east, packed in a coffin with that  mystical Jewish monster, the Golem.  It is not surprising that he and his  New York cousin Sammy Klayman  seem to have dwell on the same planet. The  two young men's mutual interest in magic, heroes, and the triumph of good  over evil send them right into the dotcom of its time - the comic book  market. Their hero, the Escapist, is the first graphic hero to battle real  villains - the Nazis - and before the U.S. had entered the war this gave  this masked man an edge that made him very popular, and both Joe Kavalier  and Sam Clay quite rich.    Joe wants the money to buy his family out  of Europe. Sammy wants wealth with the hunger of the outsider who wants his  piece of the American dream. Character-filled, youthful, busy, bursting  with opportunity, New York is the place to be, and comic books the line of  work to be in. Michael Chabon's portrait of the city at a golden time  between the Depression and a World War is as delightful his hopeful  characters, only one of whom has any idea of what might be coming.<br />You'll  care about these guys, worry about Joe's family, Sam's sexual proclivities,  and what will happen to them when the war is over and the superhero craze  is at an end. Theirs is a funny and heartbreaking journey, guided more than  they know by memory, hope, and magic.	2000-09-19
US	52397641	RJTGIYH59GAPX	068486360X	125490883	Hot Springs	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Readable, but not for the reasons you'd think.	After World War II, Hot Springs, Arkansas was the place where movie stars  and the guys on the Ten Most Wanted list went to chill out in warm thermal  waters, gamble, and take in Perry Como or Abbott and Costello's show at one  of the big hotels. It was mob-run, and touted as one of the few places on  earth where gangland-types could go for a cop-free vacation. In &quot;Hot  Springs,&quot;a new, crusading DA brings in a specially-trained squad of  police to wrestle the town out of mob hands. The resulting splatter-fest is  like something from those 1950s 25 cent &quot;men's&quot; paperbacks with  the cheesy covers.<br />The main character, Earl Swagger, is pretty wooden.  He's a Medal of Honor winner who leaves his pregnant wife in crummy  military housing so he can pretend the war isn't over and he can keep doing  what he does best - killing. Very surprisingly, given the time and place,  he likes black people.  The reason for this is disposed of in a few  offhanded sentences,  but acting so much against the way his background  conditioned him might have made his character more interesting if fleshed  out. There's a turncoat (no surprise about who that is), a noble young  Oklahoman, and a crusty oldster who supposedly brought John Dillinger down.  There are lots of descriptions of what sound like large and unwieldy  weapons. <br />So why did I keep going with this thing? Well, Stephen Hunter  has a fine sense of dialogue. I loved the way he caught Arkansas speech of  the time and place, and although the main cast of characters is a bit  leaden, there are others who aren't. Ben &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel and the  gorgeous, smart, viper-tongued Virginia Hill make several star turns. The  mob boss who runs Hot Springs, Owney Madden, flips from a phoney-Brit  accent to Hell's Kitchen growl in a way that almost makes you like him. His  henchmen are the Grumleys, a psychopathic hillbilly tribe who speak mayhem  in seventeenth century English. The black Arkansans are the most rooted  people in town, and their recognition of their precarious position in the  society is shown, not told. This is not quite enough to recommend &quot;Hot  Springs,&quot; but it did get me to the last page.	2000-09-15

A new capital,  Austin, is being built, and the new government is having to make good on  promises made during the fight for independence. Into this time of  excitement and uncertainty, Shrake brings a cast of characters so  individual and complete that you'll be hooked from page one.<br /> There's  Cullasaja Swift, a half-Cherokee woman raised in New York and her  physician-pugilist brother Dr. Romulus Swift, who come seeking spiritual  solace in the promised Cherokee homeland; Matthew Caldwell the Ranger and  his German mailorder bride Hannah; the German entrepreneur with a hatchet  blade permanently stuck in his skull; and Henry Longfellow, the genteel  murder- psychopath. The Cherokee and Comanche characters are fully drawn  and true to themselves. There are no good or bad guys here, only a number  of people trying to influence the future of a land.<br /> One of the  finest thing about good fiction is how much the reader learns. &quot;The  Borderland&quot; is full of intriguing history, characters, and fine  writing. This may be the only time I wished an airline flight would last  longer, so I could stay longer in this world undisturbed. I'd love to know  what happens next to these characters and would run to buy the sequel.	2000-08-06

That  inglorious splash into Rebel mud turns out to be a life-altering event.  August there meets and falls in love with ex-slave Isaac Kemp, who joins  him in touring the country,and eventually Europe,with a strange  spiritualist-pianist act which may be a gimmick, or may be very real. When  Isaac falls in love it is not with August but with unlikely Alice, whose  tart diaries of life in the governess profession make some snappy reading.  This unorthodox trio travels the world until the proud, moralistic Isaac  redefines their triangle forever. <br />&quot;The Notorious Dr. August&quot;  has plenty of sweep and revels in sharply observed historical detail.  Surprising, funny, aching, and always interesting, it's a hard book to put  down.	2000-07-06

We know about the lives of the famous Siamese Twins, that they were born to a poor fisher family along the  Mekong River, that they spent time at the King of Siam's court before they  were brought to New York by a cunning entrepreneur, that they had a brush  with P.T. Barnum, that they married sisters, fathered lots of children and  became slave-owning farmers in rural North Carolina. But what we can never  know is how it was to be connected to each other by a five-inch ligature  which contained a shared stomach. It is that imagining that makes Chang and  Eng such a fine and poignant book.<br />The twins had completely different  personalities. Eng, the book's narrator, was the more reserved of the two.  He spoke accent less English and read constantly, frequently annoyed by  Chang's immigrant-English and cheerful banter with the crowds. Chang may  never have learned how to use the verb to be, but his slyly clever jokes  and warm smile made him the more popular of the twins, and seemingly the  most contented with his lot. Eng always yearned for separation but Chang  did not, even when the two were in continual conflict. Chang drank, and Eng  was a spokesman for the Temperance Union. Because Chang dared make his  feelings known to a small-town Southern girl, the twins married-something  that neither had ever dreamed of-and might have been happy if Eng had not  fallen in love with Chang's wife. And because Chang died, Eng had to follow  him too soon.<br />There is enough historical detail in Chang and Eng to set  the novel in the proper period: Strauss is not out to write a piece overly  heavy in historical detail. It is the characterizations that draw the  reader into Chang and Eng's circle and make this book so memorable. Don't  miss this book. I wish Darin Strauss every success, and look forward to  what he writes next.	2000-06-28

The woman who became the wife of Chairman Mao was many people before she earned world-wide notoriety for her role in the tragedies of the Cultural Revolution. Her constant reinvention of herself (each time with a new name)  adds up to fascinating reading. Author Anchee Min was herself one of the  young women plucked from obscurity (a collective farm) by Madame Mao to  play heroines in Chinese patriotic films (a story told in &quot;Red  Azalea&quot;) and she writes that she always found Madame Mao more  sympathetic than she is usually represented. Ms. Min must be a very  empathetic person, because the Mme Mao we see is scary as hell. <br />After  barely escaping having her feet bound, the young Mme. M. begins a life of  struggling, scraping, and plotting. She is attracted to the Communist  cause, which gives her ambitions a goal she finds compatible with her  career as an actress. She forgets no slight, no lover who turned his back  on her, no director who didn't cast her, and she gets back at them all once  her star rises. She discovers that her own greatest talent lies in  manoevering the labrynthine snares of Chinese politics, which puts her  intelligence, cunning, and intuition to the test. Politics is her salvation  and her downfall. <br />It is difficult to know what name to call her in this  review - by the time she became Jiang Jing this brilliant chameleon had  taken on so many different personas that perhaps even she was not sure who  she was. <br />How can her story be told? Is anything for sure? What can be  proved? Anchee Min weaves fact and fiction to create a complex portrait of  one of the most intriguing people in recent history. Min learned English as  an adult, with an adult's understanding of depth of meaning. Her writing is  prickly and interesting, which adds richness to a story about which she has  an insider's view.<br />Min's first book, &quot;Red Azalea&quot; was so  remarkable that equalling it is a formidable task. &quot;Becoming Madame  Mao&quot; is not as satisfying, but it is an excellent inside look at  events  which are still little understood in the West.	2000-05-19

I'm not sure what to call it. It's a mystery, it's a series of character studies, it is a study  of the social mores of the late 19th/early 20th century, and it is ever so  slightly rotten, which makes everyone and everything in it just that much  more interesting.<br />May-li is a Chinese woman with bound feet who has  married into a British Jewish family living in Shanghai. Her story leads  &quot;The Binding Chair,&quot; and the others swirl around it in vivid  detail. There's her sweet Australian husband with his love of social  do-gooding, a lisping genius of a governess, May's niece, who takes her  aunt's encouragement too much to heart, and a heartbroken Russian on the  Siberian Express. I didn't care for the ending, but understand it. I would  much rather have had the book go on.	2000-05-19

Samad sends home to Bengal for a wife, and Archie marries the glorious Jamaican Clara. While Samad wants to be the  most traditional of Muslims, he is, as a matrimonial cheater and dedicated  self-abuser, almost completely off the religious track. Archie, on the  other hand, takes it as it comes. Their refuge is a greasy spoon called  O'Connor's (run by Abdul-Mickey, father of Abdul-Jimmy and brother of  Abdul-Colin, no one Irish within miles) where they hatch their plots and  commiserate when things don't happen the way they'd planned.<br />It is their  children who land in the thick of changing England, and this is where  &quot;White Teeth&quot; begins to lose its bite. The three friends  barreling through the increasingly unsavory London is not as fresh and  lively as the earlier chapters and seem less mature in outlook.  I was more  curious to know more about Clara and Alsi the Bengali bride - both  wonderful creations - than about the three kids and KEVIN, the oddball  pseudo Muslim terrorist/peace group they tangle with.<br />Zadie Smith is a  terrific new voice, and with this book her career has gotten off to a great  start. May she keep her quirky, engaging style, her bold and funny  characterizations, and continue to grow a writer of ideas and observer of  human nature.	2000-05-08

Don't get me wrong-she's made some interesting and daring picks, and has probably done more to promote decent literature than anyone else since who knows when-and here's another choice on that theme.  It reminded me of earlier choice &quot;White Oleander,&quot; and like that  novel, &quot;Back Roads&quot; is memorable and worth reading.<br />The family  in this book is probably the most out-of-whack in any in the Oprah oeuvre.   After his mother kills his father and is sentenced to life in prison,  nineteen-year-old Harley Altmeyer is given two choices. As he puts it:  &quot;I could be an ADULT with DEPENDENTS, or an ORPHAN with NOTHING.&quot;  Harley has chosen the former, and questions his choice every morning he  sets off to work two full-time jobs, coming home to three younger sisters.  Harley is a tremendously appealing character, funny and wry, who knows he's  got way too much on his plate. His life, his home, and his sisters are a  mess, and he's not getting much help in the small mining town he lives in.  It's no wonder that he falls in love with the first person who seems to see  beyond the chaos   surrounding him, and this is a terrible choice. <br />Tawni  O'Dell has done a remarkable thing. She's written a book filled with  despair and shocking revelations, which is peopled by likeable and  believable characters. &quot;Back Roads&quot; speaks to people's resilience  in even the most extreme circumstances. It deserves to be read.	2000-04-24

I'm amazed at the variety of reactions &quot;Blonde&quot; has sparked. I'm not sure whether most of them are reactions to Joyce Carol Oates (why are so many people furious at her? Is it jealousy because she  may be the only human on earth who suffers from absolutely no writer's block and can crank  out one thought-provoking novel after another?)or is it the cult of Marilyn  Monroe, the unknowable icon? At any rate, let's look at the book.<br />It is  grim. The writing is very fine, and Norma Jeane never, never gets a break.  The result: a sad read, probably pretty much like her life. The question  is, do you want to go through it with her? I did, but found  &quot;Blonde&quot; terribly disturbing and terribly depressing. We learn  nothing new about Norma Jeane or Marilyn Monroe, but do get an idea about  how she put up with her life for as long as she did and why she finally  brought it to an end.<br />Feminist? Gay-bashing? (see earlier reviews).  Hardly. The pain on all sides in this book makes it very hard to take.	2000-04-18

It would seem that Leah has escaped the South and the legacy of  slavery in her New England home, but that is far from the truth. The past  ricochets through the following generations, leaving a young grandson to  look for the truth.<br />The Pelhams, with their strong, unconventional  relationships, stubborness, and fits of violence, are an interesting bunch.  &quot;In the Fall&quot; is an unusual and compelling debut.	2000-04-17

I really didn't care for &quot;A Thousand Acres.&quot;<br />But I loved &quot;Moo,&quot; that astute and funny take on Midwestern ag  academe.<br />So now there's &quot;Horse Heaven,&quot; a book bound to boost  race track attendance nationwide. Smiley takes two years in the lives of  horses and horse people, and weaves a brisk and bright book about the  racing world. The character list includes the gamut of racetrack  regulars-the trainers, the hyper-rich owners, the gamblers, the jockeys,   horse-crazy teenage girls-and best of all, the horses. Jane's a risky  writer and takes a chance on working the horses' perspective into the  narrative, which is a kick. The horses are wonderfully imagined, and it's  great fun to find out just what they think about racing, and how well they  might do betting on each other.<br />The narrative needed to be pulled in a  little, however. Toward the end, the various stories are reeled out a  little too far to be tied up in a manner clever enough to do justice to the  rest of the book. Overflowing with imagination, &quot;Horse Heaven&quot;  needed a bolder editor to bring it over the finish line a winner by more  than a nose.	2000-04-04
US	52397641	R3AIGNYVDZWJHR	0679447172	284000734	The Gates of the Alamo	Books	5	53	54	N	N	A wide audience will enjoy this book.	From the first page this large and satisfying book, you know you are in the hands of a master. Stephen Harrigan not only knows his Texas history like nobody's business, but he knows how to create characters we  immediately care about, and finds the trick of building suspense around an  historical event with a well-known outcome. <br />Using a mix of  Northamerican, Mexican and Tejano characters both real and imagined, we see  what life in Mexican Texas was like. One major character, Edmund McGowan,  is a naturalist in the employ of the Mexican government who sees no reason  to break away. The mysterious end to that income sends him to Mexico City  to find out what's happened. The possible breakaway of Texas is the talk of  the town, and although Edmund insists that many of Mexico's Texas citizens  are perfectly happy (settlers had to become Mexican citizens and Catholics  in order to own land) a Mexico City barber sets him straight: &quot;Ah, but  these days one can only be a Mexican in one's soul. It is very difficult to  be a citizen when one's government is so inconstant.&quot; Also on this  trip he meets Stephen Austin, fresh from prison following his latest  attempt to have a rational dialogue with Mexican president Antonio Lopez de  Santa Anna, and Juan Almonte, an intelligent and powerful Mexican nobleman,  all of whom will play major parts later in the book. McGowan's relationship  with widow Mary Mott, who runs an inn on the Texas coast, adds a deep  personal note to their troubled times, as does the tie between the Mexican  sergeant Blas and a mysteries Maya girl. <br />The roster of character is  large, but each one is sharply drawn and memorable. The siege of the Alamo  is exciting and unromantic. Some of its heroes emerge as quite heroic,  others portrayed as regular people fighting for their lives. The heroism is  not confined to the defenders of the Alamo: many Mexican officers were  horrified at Santa Anna's insistence on killing everyone in the fort.<br />I'm  not sure I agree with that familiar bookending device of using a 1911 Alamo  parade  to encase the story, but what the heck, I was glad the book went on  that much longer. Unlike the work of many journalists who turn to fiction,  every page of Harrigan's novel is alive and vibrant.	2000-03-02
US	52397641	R2DW40XH8AGEAZ	0374175403	96429552	In America	Books	4	79	87	N	N	Rich in ideas, disappointing in ending	Reading this book is like having someone snatch a particularly juicy feast out from under your nose before you've had the chance to enjoy it properly.  &quot;In America&quot; is a rich tale to savor, but slices of it are  underdone and it comes to such an abrupt end that the reader is left  wondering what happened to the final course.<br />Starting the novel with an  awkward Zero chapter--meant, I think, to better explain the  characters--Susan Sontag tells of Maryna Zalezowska, the leading Polish  actress of the 1870s, who comes to California to open a utopian commune  near Anaheim. The commune quickly fails, and Zalezowska begins the task of  reinventing herself as an American actress. She does this brilliantly, and  begins a new career traveling across the United States in a private train  car performing everything from Shakespeare to the 19th century's favorite  sob-fest, &quot;East Lynne.&quot;<br />The sections on how an actress of that  age learned and prepared roles, and the insight into nuts-and-bolts  workings of 19th century American theater are marvelous, as are the  stunning monologue chapters expressing the three main characters' internal  and external struggles (the book ends with a devastating monologue by Edwin  Booth that is one terrific piece of writing). On the other hand some of the  characters are barely sketched and &quot;In America&quot; simply ends.  There's no resolution, no sense that the last page of the book should be  the last page-in fact, you'll probably turn that page expecting a  concluding chapter. And you'll feel cheated.<br />There's something mean about  allowing readers such access to characters' minds and emotions and then  chopping the narrative when there is obviously so much to come. Is it that  Sontag can't sustain the narrative? The novel reads that way. <br />It is hard  to know how many stars to give &quot;In America.&quot; I found much of it  fascinating, but felt  slighted by the lack of resolution. Yes, even thoughI know that the real-life model for Maryna, Helena Modjeska, had a long and  successful career before retiring to the remote Southern California canyon  that still bears her name, I feel robbed of the chance to follow her there,  guided by Sontag's masterly hand.	2000-02-27

After turning his back on family and religion, he has made his living as a boxer, a  highwayman, and a thief, until he found the less dangerous occupation of  thief-taker. Now drawn back into the world of London's Sephardic Jews by a  client who raises questions about Weaver's own father's death, Benjamin is  surprised to find himself comforted by  the traditions and family he  thought he had rejected.<br />This is one of those books that plop you right  in the middle of a fascinating world completely unknown to you. Author  David Liss creates the richly textured world of 18th century London Jewry,  their traditions, their aspirations, played out against the famous stock  speculation by the South Sea Company. Early stock brokers funded much of  the 18th century's wars and economic growth  from their tables in  coffeehouses across London. Of course, there were also disasters, and the  Jews, as the only stockbrokers, often took the blame for all sorts of  economic downturns, as Weaver finds out.<br />The characters in &quot;A  Conspiracy of Paper&quot; are unusual and engaging.  So many books have  been set in 18th century London that it seems to be a landscape readers  know well. One of the treats of this book is finding a different world in a  place we thought we had down pat.	2000-01-29

Lisa See's family memoir &quot;On Gold Mountain&quot; was terrific, which is probably why I'm so angry at &quot;The Interior&quot; and its predecessor, &quot;The Flower Net.&quot; The stilted dialogue and clunky,  improbable plot rendered &quot;The Flower Net&quot; unreadable, and while  &quot;The Interior&quot; has many of the same problems, it also has the  seeds of what could be a really interesting book.<br />In &quot;The  Interior,&quot; heroine Lin Hulan goes undercover on an assembly line in a  factory producing goods for a U.S. company. There, See almost seems  relieved to be able to abandon the pretense of writing an international  thriller and puts herself into the heads of regular people trying to walk  the survival tightrope in a changing China. This is good stuff. See writes  with confidence, and very quickly creates characters the reader can care  about. Once the book goes back to its international-business-conspiracy  plot, it becomes frenetic and indicative.<br />Lisa See obviously has great  feeling for China and its people. Why doesn't she drop this thriller thing  and write a novel about China, focusing entirely on Chinese characters?  That would be worth reading.	2000-01-05

She seemed to have hit the story at the right time:  here was modern medicine with all its bells and whistles looking for any  remaining tissue samples from victims of the most devastating pandemic in  the history of the world in order to keep it from happening again.    The  statistics: Between September and December 1918, possibly as many as 100 million  people died of the flu, which raged through remote Arctic villages, Western  Samoa, Philadelphia, and Cape Town with equal fury. The first cases were  reported around the world on nearly the same day, and the flu was gone  before the New Year with no traces remaining. It killed far more people  than anthrax, Ebola, the Black Death, and AIDS, more people than died in  World War I, WWII, Korea, and Vietnam combined. And the majority of victims  were in the prime of life.    What was this flu, and could it happen again?  The race to find tissue samples from victims 80 years later sent  researchers to northern Alaska, where bodies may not have defrosted since  being buried, and to northern Norway where the bodies of young miners may  hold fragments of the virus. Military specimen vaults were plumbed in  search of tissue samples from 1918 victims.     Expecting some kind of  resolution, author Gina Kolata follows two teams of competing scientists who want to  discover the genetic make up of this flu, and create a vaccine. The swine  flu and the recent Hong Kong Duck Flu seemed wakeup calls to the  possibility of another deadly epidemic. The result is terrifying: even with  all the advances of modern science, researchers still cannot isolate the  1918 virus and protect us against it.    \\"Flu\\" is one terrifying  tale, and suspenseful enough to tempt you to call in sick. But knowing what  sick really is, you probably won't.	1999-12-01

Hearing him in an interview is such a delight; you wish the conversation with this intelligent, charming, generous, and of course,  gloriously musical man would go on forever.<br />So why is this book so much  less satisfying? Especially when it was co-written with Chaim Potok. Isaac  Stern's voice does not seem to shine through, nor does his music. Why does  the telling of some of his most remarkable feats (saving Carnegie Hall or  visiting closed China) seem flat when they shimmer with excitement when he  tells them on radio or film? I hope Isaac Stern lives another 79 years and  takes a second crack at recording his remarkable life.	1999-11-29

Riley, a political science professor at the prestigious Claremont Colleges in California, must be one heck of a lecturer because her books  fly through history, weaving strands of politics, culture, humor and magic  together into an irresistible tapestry. &quot;The Master of All  Desires&quot; is Menander the Undying, purveyor of anyone's deepest wishes  (at a small price of your soul, of course) who now takes the form of a  grisly mummified head in a box. No one understands him and he is cranky all  the time, especially now that he has fallen into the hands of someone who  absolutely refuses to wish for anything. Sibille is new to Paris, has very  big feet and an overblown sense of her own refinement but she is no fool  and knows what the cost of any poorly worded wish will be. No so scrupulous  are those around her, including the Queen of France and the King's mistress  Diane de Portiers. They'll happily take Menander off Sibille's hands . .  .except they can't. Will she ever be able to unload this awful box that  materializes wherever she goes and nags her all night long? Can Nostradamus  help-and would he if he could? Intelligent, funny, surprising, and full of  action,&quot;The Master of All Desires&quot; is historical fiction at its  best.	1999-11-27

Mrs. Ahab? Are you kidding?  Sena Jeter Naslund creates a very plausible  relationship between her protagonist Una and Moby-Dick's pursuer, and very,  very wisely makes it just one element in Una's life. &quot;Mrs. Ahab&quot;  takes Una from her home in the Kentucky wilderness to a New England  lighthouse, to sea on a whaling ship, to a fine home in bustling Nantucket.  She deals with the hot button issues of the day in elegant detail, and  makes Una's involvement in the abolitionist movement, the rise of  Transcendentalist thought, and the age's fascination with the natural  sciences believable and logical.<br />Perhaps Naslund's greatest achievement  is to create a protagonist who is bold, headstrong and passionate without  making her seem like a 1990's woman decked out in a crinoline. Una is as  modern as a woman of the 1830's and 40's would be. The author's historic  research goes far beyond knowing what people wore and ate: we are shown how  they regarded the remarkable advances being made in their time, and how  they considered their world.

His first wife, a fierce, beautiful woman who runs most of his properties, has  not given him children. The relationship between these three stretch from  the final days of Britain's Indian Empire, through the brutal and bloody  partition of India, and into, the reader suspects, the next life.     `What the Body Remembers&quot; works on several levels. The characters are  fully drawn, and live in a believable, richly imagined. English-minded  Sardarji (he even has a name for the little British voice that reminds him  what is and is not done) can put aside his European teaching when it suits  him to take a second wife. Brilliant and manipulative, first wife Satya is  his political conscience and his connection to his ancestral lands.  Unformed sixteen-year-old Roop, brought on the scene to produce children,  will discover the strength of her weakness and may save her family from  destruction following the terrifying birth of Pakistan from India.<br />  As a political lesson, the novel is also fascinating reading. The  characters in &quot;What the Body Remembers&quot; are Sikhs, the religious  segment left out in the splitting of the subcontinent into Hindu India and  Muslim Pakistan. Who can they rely on when the bloodshed of Partition  begins?<br /> This is the kind of book that pulls you in quickly, and does  not release you from its spell until the last page. Another wonderful novel  about India for those who want to spend more time in the country is Vikram  Seth's &quot;A Suitable Boy&quot;-1,100 pages of pure joy.	1999-10-23

In this captivating memoir, he returns to Vietnam to discover again the country of his birth in a most  up-close-and-personal (and American) way-on a bicycle. If Andrew wanted to  find out how he was like other Vietnamese, he chose the most un-Vietnamese  way to do it, since bike-riding for fun is not something much done in that  country. Pham wants to see family and beloved places in his past, hoping  that these will help him understand what has happened to his family in the  present.<br />There are two narrative streams, both equally strong. The first  is Pham's trip and experiences in his former home; the second is the story  of the Pham family's flight to the U.S. and their sometimes funny,  sometimes heartbreaking adaptation to their new country. &quot;Catfish and  Mandala&quot; works on both levels, offering both rich travelogue and  exciting family history.<br />For readers who have had little interaction with  Vietnamese-Americans, this book is a terrific introduction to the people  who are having an increasing influence in parts of the United States. For  readers like this one, who grew up on the edge of Little Saigon (which now  is so big it has its own  exit sign on the freeway) &quot;Catfish and  Mandala&quot; hints at what might be going on in the lives of these polite  and mysterious neighbors. <br />-Candace Siegle	1999-10-11

The parents make several appearances. They do not improve with  age.<br />McCourt writes wonderfully about New York in the fifties as he  struggles to discover what he should expect of himself.  He survives a  stint in the army, goes to night school, and finally teaches. He battles  that family demon, the drink. He writes with such a distinct voice that you  might have a slight brogue for a moment after a nice long read of  &quot;'Tis.&quot;	1999-10-01

Turn-of the-century Buffalo springs to life, Lauren Belfer's descriptions of the changes wrought by the coming of electricity are interesting and insightful, but  the characters . . . anachronistic, to say the least, with 1990s sentiments  coming out of 1900s mouths.

Jack Ward is a claims investigator for the firm of the title, and is called to examine the  case of a very pricey fire in which a woman died. Nothing rings true to him  about this claim, which his old adversary &quot;Accidently Bentley&quot;  has ruled to be-that's right - accidental. The whole setup is fishy, and  the fire scenario frankly phony, but why is Jack headed off at every turn,  even by his own company?  Maybe he's wrong. Maybe the Russian mafia  un-broken-up husband is telling the truth. Maybe all those witnesses who  have now disappeared really are on vacation. By the time author Don Winslow  is finished, not only are the Russians involved, so are the Vietnamese,  land developers, bikers, surfers, a parrot, and an elderly lady with a  missing set of spoons. Everything pays off in this book and pays off in  just about the least expected way. Winslow, creates characters we enjoy and  care about, and struts an unusual and quirky literary voice You'll learn a  lot abut fire in this book, the kind of stuff only a former fire  investigator like Winslow could flash convincingly. A smart read so cool  it's hot.	1999-06-22

There's been a resurgence of interest in the ancient world recently, with  a number of authors(Colleen McCullough, Steven Saylor and Lindsey Davis  coming quickly to mind)setting their works ancient Rome. Greece has  remained in the hands of Mary Renault, but now, in &quot;Gates of  Fire,&quot; Steven Pressfield illuminates an aspect of ancient Greek life  other authors usually brush off-the Spartans and their warrior city. The  Spartans are frequently cast as the control-freaks of their age, and indeed  their Stoic philosophy combined with their complete focus on war and the  preparation for it, has made it difficult for them to earn much sympathy  not only from modern readers, but from their contemporaries. Pressfield  loves these tough guys, and readers will too. Yes, they are completely  dedicated to war, but with that focus comes a mighty sense of humor and a  great love of family and homeland. Told from the point of view of the slave  Xeones, readers will develop the same respect and affection for the  Spartans as the narrator does. Pressfield's account of the battle of  Thermopylae is chrystal-clear, horrifying and thrilling at the same time.  Through superior storytelling, one of the turning points of world history  is made as fresh as the latest news, and a hell of a lot more interesting.	1998-10-18

Persecuted Catholics, Protestant courtiers wanting to control the now mature, cranky and very savvy Queen, enemies of Mary, Queen of Scots, a defrocked nun and a midget acrobat are some of those whose causes need that diary. Finney (Firedrake's Eye) weaves a tight, complex plot that is skillfully revealed through surprising and marvellously developed characters. Readers beware: no one and nothing is safe in Unicorn's Blood, and Finney's willingness to risk characters we have become very fond of makes this the kind of book you either stay home from work to read or lose several nights' sleep over.	1997-12-13

Those of us who were outraged that Rosario Ferr&eacute; did not win the National Book Award for House on the Lagoon, will be delighted that she has a new offering. Eccentric Neighborhoods follows the fortunes of two Puerto Rican families from the end of the 19th century to the present, using the women of the family to exemplify the knife's edge where so many Latinas balance-a family that proclaims itself to be modern while limiting their daughters' choices. Ferr&eacute; wisely steers away from the magic realism that has become a Latin cliche in the hands of anyone but Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and tells a straightforward, compelling tale of plantation society on a collision course with the changing world. Unfortunately, the stunning, un-put-downable House on the Lagoon is a tough act to follow, and while Eccentric Neighborhoods certainly ranks above the rest of this year's Latin-themed fiction, it lacks the depth and complexity of her first novel. Ferr&eacute; is a beautiful writer, and I'll definitely be thrilled to follow her career. I look forward to what she comes up with next.	1997-11-26
US	52397641	R2WX4Z4FKECDVF	0380973529	772718838	Blood Red Roses	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Dark and deeply satisfying.	Intriguing characters, an unusual historical setting and complex plotting make Blood Red Roses a fitting follow-up to Margaret Lawrence's Hearts and Bones. In the difficult years following the Revolutionary War, midwife and Royalist widow Hannah Trevor struggles to keep her deaf-mute daughter from being taken from her and indentured as a servant. Few novels deal with the post-revolutionary era, when many were disillusioned with the way their new country was developing, and former Patriots faced losing their land or were threatened with debtors' prison under new tax codes.  Many middle-class Tories who had fled to England or Canada were returning home and attempting to reestablish themselves in the new United States. The Maine village of Rufford is still reeling from the divisions of war and many cruel memories are awakened when a woman and her children are murdered. Conclusions jump to Hannah, who, with her Tory connections and illegitimate child, has few defenses.  Can she clear herself or must she leave?  And what of her daughter's father, the man she loves but cannot have?  Margaret Lawrence has created conflicted, appealing characters, surrounded them with rich historical detail and the result is a tremendously satisfying book that can be enjoyed as a mystery, historical fiction or romantic suspense. Developments in the relationship between Hannah and the man she loves makes Blood Red Roses very different from Hearts and Bones and promises that the next book (please let there be one!) will have new pleasures to offer.	1997-10-27

Is it a medical thriller,  historical fiction or a futuristic warning? A ghost story? The unusual historical aspects of Amitav Ghosh's In an Antique Land drew me to The Calcutta Chromosome, but what I found here was completely different, although no less enjoyable.  An Eqyptian living in New York, Antar's deadly job is to watch the huge screen of his computer, Ava, as it sifts through all sorts of pointless information.  Ava is like a know-it-all older sister-obviously as bored with its job as Antar is with his, it is learning to speak with him in his regional dialect (which he has nearly forgotten) and waves arms across the screen to practice its Body Language of the Upper Nilotic Region, which Antar doesn't remember very well either.  Then across the screen drifts the tattered I.D. tag of a former co-worker of Antar's, a noisy and irritating man named Murugan (&quot;Call me Morgan!&quot;) who vanished into India, where he had gone to research a British scientist who discovered how malaria is transmitted to humans. The reader follows Murugan, the scientist Robert Ross, Urmila, a Calcutta journalist and tales of a mysterious train station to . . . well, it is hard to say.  The Calcutta Chromosome goes down a number of delicious paths, some more tantalizing than satisfying. The end is rather rapidly wrapped up and leaves the reader wishing for at least another twenty-five pages, for a better chance to visit with Urmila and her awful family, to learn more about the relationship between Sonali and her powerful lover Romen, between Antar, his village and his computer.  A throroughly enjoyable book, but one that pulls its punches at the end.	1997-10-13
