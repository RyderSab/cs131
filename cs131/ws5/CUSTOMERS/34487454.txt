Lucille Clifton has been writing poetry since the 60s.  Her poems have ranged from the monumental to the everyday, but her progression as a poet has been unfettered.  She is a national treasure.  There are some very interesting poems in this volume.<br /><br />\\"September Song\\" is bound to draw interest, 7 poems marking the days from the September 11th terrorist attack.  Clifton's treatment is unflappable.  She dares us to question everything about the experience, from our fears to our subsequent reactions.  She is more than unabashedly political in her views, she is also honest.<br /><br />Other poems like \\"on dying\\" do recall Dickinson.  The poem gives you a sense of resolution, not of loss.  It's a beautiful treatment that ties in well with other poems about the mortality of being diagnosed with cancer and the surreal experience of being outside your own body.<br /><br />And Clifton has never shied from treatments of race either.  But she goes deeper than just race and looks at the concepts of division.<br /><br />\\"the river between us\\" is used to juxtapose the confident self reliant man who fishes the river and the god-fearing man who goes to the river seeking salvation and calling for help from above.  It's a powerful statement and a testament to her range and skill.<br /><br />If minimalism is your benchmark for exceptional poetry, few have a better mastery than Lucille Clifton.<br /><br />At times this seems like several books of poetry back to back.  There are some sequences that require you to change gears very quickly.<br /><br />Still this is a wonderful book of poetry, which is highly recommended.<br /><br />Enjoy.	2005-02-08

Every one of the plays in this book display Hellman's mastery of dramatic form, story development, and the anti-climax.<br /><br />She is direct and yet somehow understated.  It's a wonder to me that her name is not mentioned more often in the context it deserves, as a great American playwright.  I believe those who see her in the shadow of other playwrights should rethink their comparisons.  Hellman stands on her own and deserves careful consideration.  In any event, I think everone should read these plays and decide for themselves.<br /><br />Of particular interest to me is the play \\"Days to Come.\\"  On the surface it tells the story of a small town dealing with the pressures of Organized Labor and Organized Crime.  But there is a subtext of human turmoil that is executed expertly.  The second act is particularly sharp, with great dialogue that challenges you to read between the lines.  While the complexity and number of character might make this a tough production for a small independant playhouse, there is much in her writing to be admired.<br /><br />I'm glad I took the opportunity to read what I believe to be gems in the rough.  I hope more people will do the same.	2005-02-01

David Sklansky has made a name for himself in the world of poker for a good reason.  He knows what he's talking about.<br /><br />This book is an excellent book for beginners.  There are many different levels you can read it on.  No matter how many times you've read it, you will always pick up something reading it over.  It's not wordy, it's not long, it's just plain good poker basics.<br /><br />Many have said that Hold Em Poker for Advanced Players is a better book and not much harder to understand.  I agree.<br /><br />But this book still has some punch. I particularly like the sections on pre-flop strategy and giving/getting free cards.  The one area this book is a little light on in my opinion is probabilities. This is a beginner's book and I'm sure that Sklansky did that intentionally.  Some people are scared of numbers.<br /><br />In either case, invest in this book and it will pay dividends.	2004-11-01

I can't say enough good things about this book.  I'm not a Geography Bee competitor like some of the reviewers here.  I'm just a guy who loves trivia and I had a great time reading this book.<br /><br />There is a newer Hardcover which was just released by B&N.  It's the same content by and large, just a few editorial corrections.<br /><br />The quality of printing is still somewhat low.  But the price point of the book is a lot less.  For those who love trivia, this book is priced right!  Go looking for it.<br /><br />That being said, this book is great because it has a lot of information and it's organized well.  The question format is great because it helps you digest the info.  \\"What is the Longest River?\\" is easier to swallow than, \\"The Nile is over 4100 miles long.\\"  All the same info is in there, it's just presented really well.<br /><br />One other small criticism I have of this book is that unlike many other trivia books this one doesn't list line by line sources for it's info.  That can sometimes be important.  Granted, the vast majority of Geography trivia is static so this is not too big of an issue.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great read.  Enjoy!	2004-08-31

This book is such a fun read, even those who don't crave random trivia can enjoy it!  It has so much information, and yet is so organized that you can actually find the information!  While I don't subscribe to this magazine, reading this book will make anybody consider getting a subscription.  All in all, there is really nothing but positive things I can say about this book.<br /><br />Several reviewers have criticized some of the ways information is presented in this book for the sake of political correctness, as well as some of the opinions about works discussed.  I think all the reviewers of this book make valid points.  Everybody knows what AD and BC mean, there's really no reason at this point to reinvent the wheel.<br /><br />The section on Art included a few prickly elements for me.  I personally was annoyed by some of the superlatives used to describe many of the artists.  The section on seeming like you know what you're talking about at an art exhibit is so funny, however, that it totally makes up for it.  :)  In all fairness, art is one of the hardest things to write about clearly since it's so personal for whoever is viewing it.  Look up the artists listed so that you can see some of the pictures yourself and make up your own mind!<br /><br />Those small picadillos aside, there's sooo much to enjoy here that the good far outweighs the bad.  The sections are well organized, and the authors do a great job of bringing historical figures to life with great stories.<br /><br />Many trivia books can be read for about an hour at a time. This is a trivia book that can be read for hours on end and still not make you feel overloaded.  The bite-size bits of info are easy for anybody to swallow!<br /><br />All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this book.  If it were possible to give it 6 stars I would!  Buy it, Read it, ENJOY IT!	2004-08-22

It's fun to read, and it will intrigue you for hours on end.<br /><br />The book is divided into the following chapters:<br /><br />The Universe and Earth<br /><br />Life on Earth<br /><br />The Human World<br /><br />Town and Country<br /><br />Culture and Learning<br /><br />Stage and Screen<br /><br />Commercial World<br /><br />Transport and Tourism<br /><br />Sport and Leisure<br /><br />Each section contains a group of lists.  The cool thing about it is that the source is listed so the information can be cross referenced and verified.  There's also wonderful pictures throughout.<br /><br />There are some omissions I wondered about.  In the natural disasters section, there is no list for the most distructive tornadoes.  Whatever the author's reasons, more things are included in this book than are omitted.<br /><br />The Music section offers interesting sections on songs and songwriters and all the basic benchmarks of best selling music. The biggest single of all time: Candle In The Wind by Elton John.  Biggest album: The Beatles with St. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.<br /><br />The book contains more than 700 lists and many short inserts that explain more about a subject. The text is complimented by the many stunning pictures in the book. The bibliography and index are also both very useful. To top it off, the publisher spared no expense and the print quality is great!<br /><br />The Top 10 Of Everything 2004 is a great book filled with great info.

They have written a book about our generation, different from Generations X & Y.  We are defined by the turn of the Millenium, September 11th, and the rise of the internet.  Millenials are unique, and it's time for us to take action.<br /><br />The thing that makes this book so refreshing is the way it attempts to show multiple sides of the issues.  It's not a democratic book or a republican book.  It has both the right and left represented, as well as all the shades in between that are meaningful for our diverse generation.  For that alone, it deserves to be read!  In this day and age where both parties twist the truth to the extreme just to futher their own agendas, it's great to read a book that tries to actually present the info and let you decide.<br /><br />Where this book does come up short is in depth and editing.  Depth because some complex issues are brushed upon way too lightly.  Editing, because this book shows the effects of being self-published, including spelling and gramatical errors.  As a freelance editor, I can tell you, editing is CHEAP!  I hope the authors avail themselves of a professional editor for the second edition.<br /><br />But it's natural that the full depth of every issue will not be touched upon in a book that attempts to cover so much ground.  This book is ambitious. It attempts to outline all the major issues facing our current generation.<br /><br />One of the greatest things about this book is the wealth of resources it provides throughout.  There are websites, other books, organizations, and advice listed in the book to help YOU get involved and learn more about the role Millenials must play in our system.  It belongs to us just as much as to any other generation!<br /><br />That's the greatest thing about the book.  Minor shortcomings aside, this book is a call to ACTION.  Register to Vote!  Take this book, read it, get out there, and GET ACTIVE!!!	2004-08-22

The short introduction by Rudi Giuliani gives weight to the value of this slim book.  We become great leaders by reading about the lives of great leaders and examining the thoughts of great leaders.  That's why quotes are so great.  They capture key thoughts in a way that is elegant and easy to learn from.<br /><br />This book is short.  What it lacks in length it attempts to make up for in depth of meaning.  The quotes are divided into sections: Character, Courage, Compassion, Wisdom, and Inspiration are just some examples of key themes that these quotes are grouped into.<br /><br />The quotes tend to rely heavily on Emerson, Antoine De Saint-Exupery, Plato, and Theodore Roosevelt.  While there's probably a hundred or so great leaders quoted in this book, certain figures have multiple quotes throughout.  Most all the quotes are excellent choices, with some surprising individuals quoted.<br /><br />The only reason I give this book a 4 is because, in my humble opinion, the compiler should have devoted some more quotes to Eastern thinkers.  With the great contributions in the areas of leadership by thinkers such as Sun Tzu and Musashi, it's a shame that only Confuscious, Gandhi and Lao-Tzu seem to have made it in here.  Still, it's clearly a reflection of the strong western background of the compiler.<br /><br />If you're looking for clear and motivational thoughts on leadership, this book is a great find.  I highly advise buying it!	2004-08-20

This is a pretty good travel guide.  It might have been a little too condensed.  I liked the slim form factor of the book.  I personally would have preferred if it was a little bit larger and went into greater detail on some of the topics.<br /><br />As opposed to the more complete Lonely Planet Beijing book, this book was published earlier this year.  I would like to think that some of the information is more up to date as a result.  It's simply too difficult to compare due to the fact that the book doesn't cover as many topics.<br /><br />On the upside, like most Lonely Planet books, the graphics and pictures are awesome.  I would have preferred a little more detail on the site map, but in general Lonely Planet does a nice job with their visuals.<br /><br />On a whole, I would recommend this book to somebody who will soon be travelling to Beijing.	2004-08-18

I recently read this book and I must say it was a pleasure.  This series is written as a \\"Complete Idiot's Guide,\\" meaning the material is not only supposed to be easy to understand, it's also supposed to be comprehensive.  This book is both, and it is nicely put together to boot.<br /><br />For starters, I thought the pictures and illustrations were pretty good considering the difficulty of capturing certain Yoga poses.  The good quality of the paper stock and clarity of the pictures get extra bonus points.<br /><br />In addition, the book does have extensive comments on the meaning behind the Yoga poses.  Some people may not be as interested in this kind of information, but for me knowing the names of the poses and some of the meaning behind them helps me to remember them better.  So I enjoyed that extra research.  For those who don't want that level of detail, there are a number of nice picture guides that simply show you the basic routines.<br /><br />What I really like about this book is that it not only helps you get your feet wet as a beginner, it can take you up to intermediate and perhaps even advanced understanding of Yoga.  The book is so full of good info that after you read it the first time, you can continue turning back to it for a long time to come.  As a beginner, it's good for me to know that my investment in a book will become a nice reference when I'm done reading it.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this book. :)	2004-08-18

I found this travel guide to Beijing to be very useful and nicely put together.  Lonely planet always has nice graphics and pictures.  The information was short and sweet.  There was enough information to be useful, but not so much that it was overkill.<br /><br />As has been pointed out, the chinese characters are included which is very helpful.  Also, it is true that with development being what it is in China it is impossible to write a guide that is totally up to date.  Clearly, being published going on 2 years ago, this book could use an update.<br /><br />All that being said, this is the best guidebook to Beijing that I have seen out there.  That is why I am giving it 4 stars.  Happy Travels!	2004-08-18

I am a beginner who simply loves to read books about martial arts to learn different perspectives and approaches.  This book has a lot of great qualities and it was well worth the time and money investment it took to read it.<br /><br />For starters, the writing style of the book is fluid and clean.  It's beautifully written, a true pleasure to read.  The author attempts to give the reader a very good theoretical foundation in TaijiQuan.  He provides great background information that draws novice readers into the culture and history of this art form.<br /><br />I would have to disagree with regard to the sparcity of pictures in the book.  Certainly, there is no substitute for a trainer or teacher.  I can understand the perspective of reviewers that teach this form and believe that it is best for them to guide each student's progression.  But it is unrealistic to think that all readers will have such a resource available to them wherever they may live.  Actually, it's also irrelevant.  Whether one is availed of expert instruction or not, clear pictures and diagrams showing the postures would help novices to reinforce and retain the information they read in this book.  This is why people buy books to begin with!<br /><br />In short, the content of the book seems to be good. The pictures are ok but there should have been more instructional photographs of the forms, poses and exercises.  Overall, a very good introductory text.	2004-08-18

I really thought this book was a 3, but after some thought I gave it a 3.5.  The main reason I gave it the higher score is because, as many other reviewers point out, it is a very complete reference.  It's loaded with information. The author is clearly very experienced.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as a beginner, this book came up short in several key areas.  First of all, the pictures and diagrams were simply not clear enough.  While not true of all books in this series, I find this issue does crop up from time to time.  The pictures are dark and dated, and it's very difficult to clearly see the poses.  The publisher should have sprung for new pictures for this book.<br /><br />The book's other shortcoming is in the area of organization.  The information is dropped on you as if you were reading a dictionary.  It's very difficult to learn something new by going through so much information.  The book could have been better layed out, starting with some basic exercises and then delving into the more complex.<br /><br />In my opinion, these changes would make this a tremendously better book.	2004-08-18

This book is not perfect and it does have shortcomings. I am a beginner in Martial Arts, and some of the criticism which states that this book is not as advanced as it claims to be may have some merit.  However, as far as I could tell, this book has excellent content for both novice and advanced students of Tai Chi.<br /><br />This book has some very clearly written content and outlines a large number of important movements.  Most notably, the pictures are clear and contain all the necessary markings and arrows to help a beginner reinforce what he or she learns through instruction.  Just for this aspect of the book alone, I believe it is first rate!<br /><br />Where I feel the book does fall short is in publication quality.  The paper stock was clearly very poor, and the binding quality was also poor.  This contributed to bunching in the center of the book.  However, for small lot publishing of niche products such as this one, such shortcomings are unfortunately the norm.<br /><br />Overall, the book is comprehensive and covers a lot of ground.  Perhaps for the very advanced this book may not help them get to the deeper meanings of some of the movements.  Then again, perhaps the very advanced shouldn't be looking for such meaning in a book.  Nevertheless, as a practical guide this book is a cut above the rest.	2004-08-18

If this book was written for beginners, then it comes close to being very good.  As a beginner who has never fenced, my perspective is bound to be different from that of most reviewers who seem to have more experience.  In all, this book is neither completely good nor is it bad.  It has some positives and negatives.<br /><br />On the positive side, the quality of the cover and binding are very high.  Most books I have seen on this subject are published by independants who cut corners in the quality of the book.  Not this book.  The high quality of publishing makes it easier to read.<br /><br />There's also a lot of good historical content in the book.  Whatver one thinks of Mr. Evangelista's personal opinions about classical versus modern fencing, there's enough info for the beginner to get a good feel for fencing's background.<br /><br />The book's shortcomings are, however, significant.  The technical sections might have been good, but they were weakened by poor pictures.  Since most of the sections outline movements, directional arrows are essential for a beginner trying to learn the correct basic movement.  Granted, using this book in conjunction with coaching probably answers those questions.  But what's the point of a picture if it's not useful?  In addition, many pictures were simply too dark and needed to be replaced with better ones.<br /><br />As for the author's claims of training many championship fencers, to me the validity of that matters less than the content itself.<br /><br />All in all this is a fairly good book that is worth a read but is not enough to start out with.	2004-08-18

Enjoy	Jerry Stahl seems to be able to find the sarcastic and sardonic humor in even the most downtrodden lives.  &quot;I, Fatty&quot; is a firsthand account of Fatty Arbuckle's tumultuous life.  It's written very simply and helps us to imagine the inner turmoil of being an outsider in a judgemental society.<br />Born to an abusive father in Kansas, Arbuckle turned to theatre as an escape from a bitter life. He rose to fame in the cinema and at one point was more popular than Chaplin.  He was the first screen actor to make a million dollars a year.<br />But in 1921 he was accused of the rape and murder of actress Virginia Rappe. He was slandered by the press and not even his acquittal could save his career.  He eventually lost everything.<br />Stahl emphasizes the mental anguish of being fat, impotent, and presumed guilty.  He also shows the role that heroin played in Fatty Arbuckle's life.  Heroin was readily available and legal at the time, and he became addicted using it as a pain killer after a botched medical procedure.  Towards the end of his years, his servant used heroine as a tool to get Arbuckle to divulge all of his secrets.<br />I had the pleasure of hearing Stahl read from the book and it was quite entertaining.  He joked that it is obligatory for him to include heroin in every one of his novels.  He emphasizes the public outcry against Fatty as being led by a conservative anti-Hollywood element.  I would agree, but would also like to point out that in the 1920s journalists had more leeway to embelish the truth and print it as fact.  Even today, the press chooses to emphasize some facts over others and often slanders people in the process.<br />If you are interested in the life of one of Hollywood's first stars, and if you like dark humor, &quot;I, Fatty&quot; is for you.  It's a good read that will make you think and give you a laugh or two.	2004-07-20

Especially when it comes to technical books, it's almost impossible to perfectly meld the technical, the relevant, and the well written into the same text.  Well I'm here to tell you that David McAmis and Don Jones have done it!<br />This was the first Delta Guide Series book that I have reviewed.  I hope they are all this good because I'm looking forward to finding out.<br />The book basically covers Exchange Server 2003 soup to nuts.  It does a very effective job of emphasizing the differences between this release, Exhchange 2000, and Exchange 5.5.  It also covers all the other basics you would need to know, such as licensing, versions, hardware requirements, limitations, and configurations.<br />One slippery topic that was especially well covered was Active Directory.  This book isn't a complete Active Directory reference for Exchange.  Those sections covered the most useful information thoroughly without excess abstraction.  Excellent!<br />What made this book so refreshing was the absense of useless filler that typifies so many technical books.  It was complete but at the same time to the point.  Every chapter in this book is time well spent.<br />There are some usefull links sprinkled throughout.  Those are bonuses. What really makes this book stand out is the quality and presentation of the information.  Kudos to the writers and editors of this awesome text!	2004-07-14

This book, like all technical books, obviously took a number of people a large amount of time to complete.  No disrespect to the authors but they missed a lot of basic things.<br />The book does have some decent info.  But, once again, it appears the publisher decided to put out a book to take advantage of demand for a new product.  They should have focused more on beefing up their content and they might have had something.<br />There is a lot of information that should be obvious to somebody with experience in the technology field.  Do we really need migration planning meeting notes with generic categories like &quot;Budgetary Issues, Planning Considerations, Technical Resources?&quot;  I don't think so.<br />Worse still, some of the contents of the book were illegible.  Figure 2.4 of the Sample Project Schedule was totally blotched.  Is this a shameless attempt to further thicken a book that is 70% filler?<br />Perhaps this was once again a failure in layout.  They could have included all that migration stuff in a later chapter.  Why did they include that before discussing more about the Exchange Server itself?<br />In fairness, there was some useful info in the book.  But do I have to see another screen shot of somebody right-clicking in the management console?!?!  Argh!!!<br />It's a shame that this book was such a missed opportunity.  Publisher's like this need to pay for experience technical editors to correct these issues before publication.  I don't blame them necessarily for trying to put out a book quickly and make a fast buck though.<br />For somebody who is a TOTAL beginner in technology and wants to learn about Exchange, this book probably holds some value for you.  If you've just been assigned to plan an Exchange Migration and you haven't a clue, there is plenty of filler here to prolong some useless meetings.  For anybody with any experience or knowledge of Exchange, this book is repetitive, slow, and not an effective use of your time.	2004-07-14

It's awesome that they actually put useful stuff in a pocket guide!<br />Whether you're an advanced administrator or a beginner, this book is worth the investment.

Nobody can question that the author is informed.  For me, this book fell short of the mark because the good info was often buried in needless chatter.<br />I've worked as a Solaris Admin for many years and I've read a LOT of Solaris books.  This book isn't the worst book ever written.  But it falls into a general pattern that is common for books of this type.<br />First off, this book is meant to be a guide for Beginning Sys. Admins.  The same author already has a Solaris reference book.  That's why it pains me that this book contains so much &quot;reference-like&quot; filler.  Do we really need another book rehashing the origins of Unix?  Couldn't they cram that stuff into an appendix and list some more pertinent background info?  But I guess the publisher decides this book must contain X number of pages and the author just cuts and pastes from his other texts.<br />There was also excessive redundancy in this book.  The same run-level chart that appears in the first secion reappears in the third.<br />The writing style is wordy and unpractical.  I too got my start in Unix in a university lab, but System Administration is about doing a lot in a short amount of time. Could you please get to your point without all of the prose?<br />And hidden in those long paragraphs were great links and commands.  But this book wasn't well structured to have those things stand out.  Instead, only somebody who has a LOT of time to read every single word can truly garner all the information in this book.<br />A lot of people clearly like to read wordy academic style unix books.  Perhaps it's only the books title that's a problem.  Still I think the book could have at least been laid out a lot better.  I also would have thought it better if it had shorter more clearly focused sections that actually had to do with administration.	2004-07-14

But those expectations seems unrealistic.  The book is not titled &quot;Implementing PKI,&quot; it's called &quot;Understanding PKI.&quot;<br />There is value in a concepts book.  For experienced technical professional trying to get a grip on the terminologies and concepts of security and PKI, this book is succinct and touches all the major points.<br />For those looking for screenshots of people right clicking icons, there's a thousand other books like that!  Most of those so called &quot;technical books&quot; are not that technical.  It's nice to have a book that's not product specific for a change.<br />This book does what it intends to do well.  There is a need for more technical books but this book is valuable in it's present form.  I have given several copies to peers.<br />I hope this review helps you balance out your opinions before deciding for or against this book.	2004-05-07

Great writers write about what they know and the places they know.  It's not a surprise that McMurtry sets so many of his stories in Texas.  But that does not lessen the universality of his stories.  The Last Picture Show is simply the best coming of age story about growing up in north america ever written.<br /><br />This book is written in a clean direct style.  Some may feel that in order to be termed \\"great literature\\" a book has to have a wordy and complex style.  But to me, the greatest literature is that which most clearly cuts to the essence of what makes its characters human.  Those are the characters we relate to in literature.  And this book is loaded with them.<br /><br />In fact it's almost frightening the way McMurtry gets inside the heads of these kids.  You are bound to cringe at least once remembering the times you made the exact same mistakes as these kids.<br /><br />I don't think this type of amazing story-telling is unique to this novel.  Terms of Endearment is an incredible novel and seems to have not been mentioned by most other reviewers.  Of course Lonesome Dove is bound to have admirers as well.<br /><br />In all, this is a great novel that is simple on the surface but has layers of complex undertones for those willing to explore them.  As a coming of age story, this is one of my favorites.<br /><br />Enjoy.	2004-04-29
US	34487454	R2T4AGHUOAWTGX	038549081X	709722953	The Handmaid's Tale	Books	2	12	35	N	N	Unoriginal and Poorly Written.  Read 1984 instead.	The Handmaid's Tale takes place in a future not too long after the 1980s.  The world is environmentally destroyed and widespread infertility leads to fertile women being treated as commodities.  This is accomplished by a military coup of the US government with strong religious undertones.<br /><br />This is a decent idea for a story on the surface.  However, Atwood's execution was poor.  She has done some decent writing, this book is just not an example of that.<br /><br />I can see that many people liked this book.  If this is the first book of this kind that one reads, I could see why.  It's not the worst book ever written.  Still it's bad enough to not warrent a read.<br /><br />There is nothing original about this book, unfornuately.  George Orwell's 1984 was written much earlier than this book and yet still surpasses it in foresight, complexity, and language.<br /><br />Atwood's only claim to fame is her incessant hatred of the politics of the \\"religious right\\" as she sees them.  She really didn't have to write this ridiculous book to get across the point that religious views are damaging when taken too far.  Anti-religious views can be equally taken too far.  They can lead to long drawn out and boring books that teachers use to punish their students.<br /><br />A bad book was made into an even worse movie.  Please save 2 hours of your life and never see it.<br /><br />Attwood's writing style is what perhaps makes this book hardest to stomach.  It's bad enough that she basically rewrote George Orwell and still managed to do less of a job.  Her plot and character development is so poor, and her command of the written word so trite, that anybody who reads avidly will wish they had picked something else off the shelf.<br /><br />For those who like this book, I respect your opinions.  Please read A Clockwork Orange by Burgess, or 1984 or Animal Farm by Orwell.  Those are books that are not only written by much better writers, but also much more original and meaningful.	2004-04-29
US	34487454	R3OX5CWAQ9CGL2	0804111359	207158162	The Secret History	Books	4	17	19	N	N	One of the best first novels ever written.  MUST READ	This novel is a great read.  It's not the greatest novel ever written, and I don't think it tries to be.  It's an unbelievably mature first novel for such a young author.  I'm less enamoured by the greek tragi-comedic overtones myself.  I think it's just a cool, sexy story that keeps one's interest with a well developed plot line and an interesting protagonist.<br />Despite the cookie cutter nature of some of the characters, I did eventually come to believe them.  The dialogue is more than a bit trite, but I came to feel that perhaps even this was done intentionally.  Isn't that the way self-imagined intellectuals talk?  Don't they always seem to be fighting to use the new words they just learned?  :)<br />Some have suggested that one must look past the pretentious nature of the book and its characters.  I always thought that Tartt wrote this book that way for a reason.  It seems that there is a large population of prententious intellectuals.  Tartt's novel is powerful because she shows the dangers that exist when people feel smarter than and superior to others.  Just that perception alone makes them capable of terrible things.  Never mind the fact that they are most often wrong.  After all, there can't be that many people who are smarter than everybody else.  By definition, there's never enough of those people to form a group.  :)	2004-04-29

So often coming of age novels melt into the same overplayed simplistic formula.  Not only does this novel tell the story of a young girl learning about herself, her family and life, but it does so in a way that is honest and believable.<br />The writing style is very poetic, and I would venture to say there are not many wasted words, if there are any at all.  But the writer treads just softly enough to use language in a way that evokes imagery and emotion.<br />Some of the plot line is a little bit predictable, but only as much as life can be predictable.  There are enough twists and turns to keep readers interested though.<br />Overall this book is definitely worth the read.  It reminds us how naive we all once were, and some of us still are.  It reminds us also how it felt to realize for the first time how quickly those we love can be taken from us.	2004-04-29

I've seen plenty of diet and exercise books that have had me laughing out loud because of their inaccuracies.  Usually when a book has the kind of glossy hardcover jacket and hammy pictures this one does, it fits right into that category of &quot;written for suckers and desperate people.&quot;<br />This book was a surprise though.  The workouts are sound!  The diet info, while very basic, is accurate.  And the misconceptions Sepe dispells are just that: misconceptions.<br />If the glossy pictures lure women into reading this book, so what.  I particularly love the way Sepe dispells the myths that:<br />1. Weight training makes women into musclely amazons (false!!)<br />2. Long term weight loss can be achieved without exercise (false!!)<br />This book also has a healthy emphasis on limiting caloric intake, which while simple has been desperately lacking in the &quot;Atkins&quot; and &quot;Southbeach&quot; diet era.<br />It is true that Sepe could have devoted a little bit more time explaining the proper form of some of these weight exercises.  He also could have included more up to date diet info.  These are the only reasons I gave the book a 4 instead of a 5.<br />This is a wonderful book that should not only be read.  It should be studied.  Just try to focus more on the content than on the glossy photos.  ;P	2004-04-29

This book is light on substance and lighter on style.  The only redeeming quality to it is that this guy was able to sucker over a million people into paying money to read it.  Priceless.<br />Some of his other books actually have some useful insights, although none of them is close to being the best in this genre.  The Art of the Deal is worth listening to on audio book.<br />I do take issue to the book's title.  That's just shameless grandstanding, and it's totally inappropriate for this book.  It's no secret that Trump used his TV show as a jump-off point to sell this book so he should have used a title that was related to that.<br />mdavia2's review was dead on.  But still, Trump put his name on such a terrible book, got some ghostwriter to do all the work, and still got over a million suckers to buy it.  There has to be something to be said for that!  I wish I could make money off of it.  :)<br />Want to learn how to get rich?  Read &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot; instead.  Need something to steady that wobbily table?  At just over 2 inches thick, this book might do the trick.	2004-04-29

Tech books from before 2000 should not be judged on whether they are up to date.  That's a given!  They should be judged by how well written and informative they are.  This book is both.<br />Granted the software distribution on the included disk doesn't contain much of actual value.  But the tips and tricks in the book still work!  It's amazing that after all these years so few people still follow best practices.<br />For a collector of tech books, like myself, this book is an invaluable addition to one's library.  When Solaris ruled webservers, this book showed how to build a server at a fraction of the cost.  I have no doubt that this will be desirable for collectors in the future.	2004-04-16

This book should not be the first poker book you read. But reviewers neglected to mention that the author himself states this in &quot;General Poker Concepts&quot; and suggests many starter texts.<br />2.  This book does spend significant time on topics other than what's going on inside a poker player's mind. The author might do too much of that, but it's clear that he does so to provide supporting info. The sections contrasting the thoughts of average vs advanced players do treat the subject and perhaps they deserved more emphasis.<br />3.  Yes, the author does criticize non-limit and tournament play. Playing in casino situations is very differnent from tournaments where the chips don't represent real money dollar for dollar.  Nobody said it doesn't take skill to win.  It's just a different skill set. Truth be told, there are plenty of great tournament books if that's what you are into.<br />FALSE:<br />1. No, it is not fair to say this book is unoriginal. Nor is it accurate that Sklansky's and Malmuth's books cover everything in this book. This book has some really great real world examples of poker logic spelled out much more clearly than in other books. It doesn't have to be the definitive poker book to be a valuable read.<br />2. While the book does start out a little slow, I found the stories very funny.  For those who play in casino or card-room games, you will find humor in reading Feeney's examples of mistakes that you have seen yourself and others make.  I did.<br />3. One point needs clarification before some unsuspecting person goes and drops $2K in Vegas after reading this book.  Reading this book will NOT save you thousands of dollars.  No book will save you $.  Only UNDERSTANDING the concepts the book trys to bring across will actually make you or save you money.<br />On pg 62, he writes, &quot;Education in poker theory reduces one's susceptibility to illusions which can interfere with good play.&quot;  Man I wish I could believe this.  I think his advice to seek psycotherapy might do more to that end.<br />So many people read a few books and lose their shirts because of false confidence.  While I totally understand the value of the material, value cannot be derived by reading it.  It must be digested, pondered, and mastered to be valuable.<br />The coolest thing about this book is the relevance of the examples.  Every topic, from reraising the weak to calling on the end, was treated in a real world way that I have observed in casino play.  A great example is &quot;Maximizing the Set&quot; on pgs 127-128.  So many books treat these concepts abstractly.  I must say that I did not fully understand much of this till I read this book.<br />Again, the outline of the way bad players think was the hallmark.  It talks about things that not only stop you from making mistakes but help you identify the saps in a real game.  Perhaps the treatment of tilt could have been more explicit.  But his unique viewpoint provokes thought, even though it comes along with resistance.<br />There's a common quote that goes, &quot;If you look around the poker table and don't see any suckers, you're it!&quot;  I would strongly advise anybody reading the sections on advanced vs. weak player thoughts to read the hands and honestly evaluate what they would be thinking if they drew that hand before reading the author's explaination.  This is a serious wake-up call to those who are unknowing maniacs or overconfident goats.<br />Overall this is a very practical read that deserves the attention of anybody looking to increase their hourly rate in actual casino and card-room play.&quot;Education in poker theory reduces one's susceptibility to illusions which can interfere with good play.&quot;  Man I wish I could believe this.
