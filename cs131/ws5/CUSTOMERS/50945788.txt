While I was reading The Perilous Gard I kept hearing that music in my head.<br /><br />Kate Sutton, a lady in waiting to Princess Elizabeth, is exiled to Elwenwood Hall when her pea-brained sister gets her in trouble with Queen Mary (Tudor.)<br /><br />On the journey there she sees a mysterious lady in a green cloak and is soon embroiled in the secrets and terrible history of the castle also known as Perilous Gard. Her new guardian, Sir Geoffrey, cannot wait to get away from the place. His brother, Christopher, is filled with guilt over the disappearance of Sir Geoffrey's young daughter years earlier.<br /><br />The local villagers fear the fairy folk who live under the hill and supposedly kidnap children. The inhabitants of the castle are rumored to be in league with them.<br /><br />When Kate stumbles into the underground realm of the Lady In Green she must work to keep a hold on reality while looking for a way to escape.<br /><br />I enjoyed this read a great deal.	2005-10-05

She has lost her beloved aunt and is grieving deeply. At the funeral a relative hands her a pair of knitting needles and teaches her to knit. Scottie is initially put off by the idea but soon finds the yarn calls to her. She finds a wonderful little knitting shop run by a remarkable woman who has a gift for matching up yarn and people. By the end of the evening three other girls from her high school have arrived at the shop and a circle of friends, \\"Chicks with Sticks\\" is born.<br /><br />The girls come from very different backgrounds and are trying to find their place in high school. Both of Scottie's parents are consumed by her mother's art career and seemingly oblivious to their daughter. Amanda is the homecoming queen type but suffers from learning disabilities which undermine her confidence and her academics. The other two have their own problems and issues but they all find help and support through their knitting friendships. Despite their resolve it takes great courage for them to pull out their knitting at lunch time in the school cafeteria.<br /><br />Lenhard obviously knows her knitting. She lovingly describes beautiful yarns including the colors, textures and even the smell. The girls struggle with dropped stitches and projects that go horribly wrong but their fingers have the knitting itch.<br /><br />Lenhard has included knitting patterns at the end of the book. By the time you finish you will be yearning to pick up some knitting or learn how to knit.<br /><br />This book sent my daughter and me to the store yesterday. We bought knitting needles and squeezed yarn balls until we found the ones that \\"called\\" to us. We have big plans.	2005-09-30

Art teachers are often looking for additional examples to share with students besides Eric Carle and Ezra Jack Keats. She also uses oil pastel, colored pencil and digital effects to complete her work. The staring eyes of the animals in the books are digital.<br /><br />I enjoyed I Love the Night.

How does a writer bring a story with this level of drama and tragedy to children? Austin writer Julie Lake has recreated the time period through research and imagination.<br /><br />Abby Kate is enjoying and extended visit with her grandmother in Galveston Texas on September 8, 1900. The island residents had little warning that the storm of the century is about to break. Living at sea level, high tides were common. In the beginning Abby Kate thinks it is exciting to see ocean spray \\"crashing up way above the street car trestle.\\" As the water starts to rise the excitement turns to terror. Like many victims that day, Abby Kate must cling to prayer and a makeshift raft in order to survive the nightmare.<br /><br />Lake continues the story through the storm's aftermath. Readers will have a good idea of how the citizens of Galveston regrouped to heal and remake their city. Lake has done her homework and the after word includes excellent historical information. American Red Cross founder, Clara Barton personally visited the island to assist with the recovery.	2005-09-20

Tomasu is found and adopted by Lord Shigeru who changes the the boy's name to Takeo and provides him with an education and instruction in the martial arts.<br /><br />The story line shifts to another castle where a lovely young woman, Kaede is being held as a hostage in the political wars of the feudal Japanese type era. Takeo and Kaede's paths cross when she is betrothed to Shigeru in exchange for peace with the nasty Iida. There are several subplots that come into play including the truth of Takeo's parentage, a secret Christian-like religion whose followers called \\"the Hidden\\" are persecuted for their beliefs, and a clan called the Tribe who have amazing fighting skills as well as the ability to become invisible.<br /><br />The paperback versions are beautiful little editions, (only 6 inches high) that fit in my hand perfectly. The story is a page turner. I would certainly recommend these books to high schoolers who are interested in Japan as well as readers of historical fiction. Though the story is fantasy this is NOT Lord of the Rings \\"&agrave; la japonais.\\" I enjoyed the story and am anxious to see what happens next to these young people.	2005-09-20

Unlike Beatrice, Hero is not socially adept and does not make friends easily. She does become acquainted with their older next-door neighbor, Mrs. Roth who tells her about the Murphy Diamond, a valuable gem that might be hidden in Hero's house. Surprisingly she is also befriended by a popular 8th grader, Danny who is the son of the city's police chief who is also fascinated by the diamond's where-abouts.<br /><br />Hero discovers a mysterious connection between the diamond, Anne Boleyn and Shakespeare's plays which fires her imagination.<br /><br />This plot is cleverly drawn with historical details and intrigue. Hero and Danny are searching for more than a diamond and the reader is hoping they find their heart's desire.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed this novel. The mystery is very satisfying. One can hope it would also excite a reader's interest in Shakespeare.	2005-09-13

Up until then life hadn't been very interesting for Lily.\\"<br /><br />Lily Gefelty is the only one who seems to understand that her father's weird boss, Larry is planning to take over the world using whales on stilts with lasers in their eyes. She is helped by her friend Katie Mulligan, a Nancy Drew/Buffy type whose real life adventures are serialized in Horror Hollow Books (Goosebumps/Fear Street) and Jasper Dash, Boy Technonaut (Tom Swift &agrave; la Orphan Annie selling Ovaltine, only here it is Gargletine) who sports vintage clothing and turns of phrase from a bygone era.<br /><br />In the great tradition of children's books, the parents are hilariously clueless. Her father does not think it odd that Larry, the boss, wears a sack over his features, has a flipper-like hand, dumps green brine over his head and openly admits his plan for world domination might interfere with the Gefelty family vacation plans.<br /><br />The story is over-the-top fun, bizarre, strange yet traditional and conventional with behind the scenes publishing humor...	2005-09-13

This is the premise of Walter Mosley's first YA novel. Goddess of YA Lit, Teri Lesesne pointed me towards the audio version of this book when she recounted sitting in the driveway at her home, unable to get out of the car, because she and her family were so immersed in this story.<br /><br />The teenage protagonist has been protected from the brutal realities of slave life for approximately 14 years by his surrogate mother Big Mama Flore. When he is sent to work in the fields, he is branded with the number 47 which becomes his only name.<br /><br />He encounters Tall John, a run away slave who implies he has been looking for 47 for a long time and the two are already linked in friendship and spirit. Tall John instructs 47 to \\"neither master nor nigger be!\\" He demands that 47 reject his acceptance of slavery and begin to look at the world and the universe through new eyes.<br /><br />47 marvels at Tall John's magic yellow bag which can conceal them from enemies and heal their wounds and learns that Tall John is from another world. He is fighting beings called the Calash who are present on Earth in human form and 47 has been called to free his own people from the anathema of slavery and to fight the other forms Evil takes throughout the ages.<br /><br />Initially I had some difficulty catching all of Ossie Davis's narration but now I cannot fathom experiencing this book in any other way. Davis is the voice and heart of this story.<br /><br />Part historical fiction, part sci-fi, part folk tale and legend, 47 is one of the most original stories I have experienced.	2005-09-11

At the beginning of this sequel, Nathaniel is on the fast track to success in government as a wizard.  He is trying to unravel the secrets of the Resistance that is causing problems throughout London.  A new series of very powerful attacks around the city have the governing class on edge and Nathaniel is under great pressure to discover who is really behind the trouble. He summons Bartimaeus to help him uncover the Resistance's secrets.  He suspects the mysterious street kids he encountered in the first book are involved.<br /><br />The story shifts and we see this London through the eyes of Kitty, one of the kids Nathaniel is looking for.  Her eyes see a world where magicians have all the power and commoners like her and her family and friends are treated like second class citizens. A cruel attack on a friend by a wizard sends Kitty out in search of revenge.  As part of the Resistance she organizes raids to steal magical objects. Strangely she is not affected by magic.<br /><br />While attempting to retrieve some artifacts from Gladstone's tomb, Kitty's group is betrayed and her Resistance cell is destroyed.<br /><br />Throughout the story we hear Bartimaeus's narrative of events.  His observations are delivered with his customary humor though it is tinged with the suffering of a slave.  He is the one who discovers the true nature of the threat facing this world.<br /><br />The reader is routing for Kitty and hoping Nathaniel will see the light and turn his back on the corrupt government.  We are also cheering for Bartimaeus and hoping for his freedom.<br /><br />Stroud has created a world that is rich in atmosphere and fully realized.

One night the doorbell rings and a tall man with a thin tie enters their family's home and announces \\"We've come for the boy.\\" His \\"normal\\" life is over. He hears his mother yell, \\"JIMMY RUN!\\" and though he is bewildered by the sudden change from mundane family life to men in dark suits chasing him,  he finds he can run, jump, dodge and defend himself expertly.<br /><br />The book takes off with Jimmy as he runs for his life and tries to understand his new abilities and strengths. The action is fast paced as he learns the devastating truth about secret government agencies, his family, his life and existence.<br /><br />One aspect of this story that will resonate with readers is Jimmy's struggle to overcome his \\"programming.\\" He does not want to become the assassin he was created to be. His refusal to succumb to his nature is admirable and reminds us that we all have choices to make in our behavior, despite our background.  I think this is one of the most interesting points of the book.<br /><br />Jimmy's loyalty and love for his family is strong despite his conflicted emotions. His sister Georgie is fiesty and you don't mess with her.  This is a fun read with echoes of the Bourne Identity that readers will enjoy.<br /><br />I am looking forward to seeing what Jimmy's next move will be.	2005-08-11

Doreen Cronin has penned another wonderful \\"diary.\\"  Like her \\"Diary of a Worm\\" Cronin has interwoven facts with whimsy. We learn that spiders are NOT insects and they molt. Spider is friends with Worm from the previous book and also with Fly although his Grampa says in HIS day spiders and flies did not get along.<br /><br />In school young spiders are warned about the dangers of vacuums and have vacuum drills.<br /><br />He says, \\"If we hear a vacuum we should \\"Stop, Drop and Run!\\"<br /><br />When they say the Pledge of Allegiance, their flag is a panel from a Spiderman comic book showing the American flag. In many ways Spider's day is like any kid's with a sleep-over and time with friends.<br /><br />The clever illustrations by Henry Bliss add additional humor. As in \\"Diary of a Worm,\\" the endpapers are full of great vignettes,such as, \\"Favorite book: Charlotte's Web.\\"<br /><br />This book is a natural pick for elementary school libraries and teacher gifts. The two diaries would also be a \\"must-have\\" for junior high libraries to complement life science units. My former students tell me they are never read to in junior high.  Class periods are only about 50 minutes long so Cronin's books would fit perfectly and work well with any curriculum.<br /><br />Her humor is simple yet savvy and has appeal for all ages. Her \\"Duck for President\\" is essential during presidential election years.<br /><br />After reading this book I will NEVER forget that spiders are NOT insects. There is so much to see in the pictures and the text is so entertaining  you will want to read it again and again.	2005-08-10

Wasn't the day job working out Katie?<br /><br />As I picked up the book from a display of \\"back to school\\" books it was not displeasing to look at. Although the illustrations are working hard, they cannot rescue this book.  The storyline was very predictable, heavy handed and pedantic. The rhyming verse just saws away and lumbers along in a forced and sing-song fashion.<br /><br />\\"His name is a different one, Lazlo S. Gasky.  He's new to our school and the town of Delasky.\\"<br /><br />Wow, how about that.  The kid's last name happens to rhyme with the name of the town.  Golly.<br /><br />To go on any further would be cruel. Couric and other lesser lights are under the impression that a tale must be moralistic in order to appeal or impress children. I suppose it does impress unsuspecting parents and grandparents who will misguidedly but with the best of intentions, purchase this book.<br /><br />If you are looking for a REALLY good book with this theme, go get \\"Stand Tall, Molly Lou Melon\\" by Patty Lovell with divine illustrations by David Catrow.	2005-08-10

Sylvester is a beloved son with a happy life.  He collects rocks and pebbles.  One day he finds a very unusual one which he is holding when a lion appears and scares  him.  In a panic, he wishes he was a rock so the lion will not hurt him.  He becomes a rock.  Be careful what you wish for.<br /><br />Seasons pass and Sylvester, in his misery, goes into a kind of sleep.  The grief of his parents for their missing son is tenderly rendered in Steig's simple drawings.  His parents decide to go on a picnic in order to cheer themselves up a bit. They find a large gray rock that they can use as a table.  They also find a strange pebble that they place on the rock.<br /><br />Children become very caught up in this story and the sad silence that settles over them as they contemplate the terrible spot Sylvester is in makes the happy ending even more joyful. It is lots of fun to use the Sylvester doll that morphs into the rock when sharing the book with kids.<br /><br />The movie rights to this book have been purchased.  This story is a keeper.	2005-08-02

The scheme is  profitable until they accept a bet to steal a dog dish from the home of Mr. Crawley, the neighborhood eccentric. The Schwa is discovered by Crawley who can see him very clearly.  As punishment, Calvin and Antsy become dog-walkers for the old man's 14 dogs. Later Crawley asks Antsy to befriend his visiting granddaughter, Lexie, who is blind.  Schwa, Antsy and Lexie begin a search into Calvin's past and try to find out what happened to  his mother. Is Calvin's \\"invisibility\\" tied to his past?<br /><br />This detailed story is a page turner.  Schusterman writes with compassion and humor.<br /><br />As someone who works in a school setting, I found the story very moving because these \\"invisible\\" kids are in our classes. They are quiet, engaged and self sufficient so we sometimes overlook them. So much of a teacher's attention is claimed by high-needs students but the quiet ones also need all the recognition and acknowledgement that their teachers and friends can give them. The Schwa reminds me to make an even greater effort to keep these kids on the radar!<br /><br />This is a great read that will be appreciated by kids in grades 4 and up.	2005-07-27

It is a new school year and poor Billy Raven continues to suffer at the hands of the Bloors who have him adopted by a couple who despise children. We learn more about Billy's background and Charlie thinks he is close to solving the mystery of his father's disappearance. A new student at school, Joshua Tilpin has magnetic powers and seems destined to fill Billy's former shoes as spy and student villain.  One more of Charlie's friends discovers her own magic endowment and helps thwart the bad guys.<br /><br />Cook, Uncle Paton, the Pets' Cafe, and the dog Runner Bean make brief appearances as do the bad guys, Manfred Bloor and the Yewbeam sisters.<br /><br />The book was entertaining but not as satisfying as the previous books. The promising leads to Charlie's father's where-abouts are dashed and the story line is not advanced.  The red herring Nimmo inserts was disappointing as it would have been a richer story if it had lead to something.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the series, as I am, you will enjoy the story but it felt more like one of those \\"extra scenes\\" that you can view on DVDs-interesting and fun but does not add to the story overall.	2005-07-08

Koboi has set the human world and the fairy world on a collision course. The very existence of the Haven (the fairy realm) is threatened.<br /><br />LEP Recon thinks Holly has gone mad and killed her commanding officer and they are coming after her. Holly knows she has one chance to capture Koboi but it means saving Artemis and restoring his memories.<br /><br /> Artemis's very cool bodyguard, Butler as well as the dwarf felon, Mulch Diggums are part of the team again. The Lower Elements have their share of bureaucrats and administrative incompetants which frustrate the centaur, Foley who is LEP's technology guru. His technological wonder gadgets give the books some of their \\"wow\\" factor.<br /><br />One passage in the book made me laugh out loud knowing something about the Colfer's TV preferences.<br /><br />...Holly walked rapidly into the cockpit and strapped herself into the pilot's chair, \\"Seven and a half hours to save the world. Isn't there some law that says we get at least twenty-four?\\"<br /><br />  Artemis strapped himself into the copilot's chair. \\"I don't think Opal bothers with laws,\\" he said...<br /><br />When Colfer was in town for a book signing recently, he shared that one of his favorite T.V. shows is \\"24.\\"<br /><br />The story has plenty of action and humor.

Shopping for a swimsuit is the ultimate fashion terror but jeans shopping is a close second. Ann Brashare's has cleverly tapped into the female psyche by creating a magical pair of thrift store jeans that look fabulous on four friends who are different sizes and body types. The four girls are separating for their summer activities and decide the jeans are a talisman of luck that they will share during the coming months.<br /><br />Tibby is working at the fictional Wallman's (think Walmart) for the summer and working on her documentary. Lena is traveling to Greece to stay with her grandparents. Carmen's parents are divorced so she is off to South Carolina for what she hopes will be some personal time with her father. Bridget is an athlete who is attending a soccer camp in Baja California and missing her deceased mother.<br /><br />Each girl keeps the pants for a week before they mail them off to next \\"sister.\\" Things go wrong for all four girls but their letters and support for each other help them through their disappointments. It becomes a summer where the girls learn about themselves. The stories of Tibby and Carmen were very touching.<br /><br />The magical pants are amazing but the book's success is due to junior high girls' yearnings to have a group of friends as kind, helpful and supportive. Hey, most folks would be happy with one dear friend like this. (Most of the girls I know like the 1st and third books the best.)	2005-06-20

It has comedy, drama and an environmental message.<br /><br />I do wonder how many teens really endorse this book as much of the humor comes from three rather hapless adult characters in the book. They may enjoy the ribbing the characters receive. Ultimately, I think Hiaasen is successful in recounting the adventures of Roy Eberhardt, the new kid from Montana who has arrived at Trace Middle School in Coconut Grove, Florida.<br /><br />He is the target of an oafish bully and is trying to avoid being killed on the school bus when he sees a boy his own age running barefoot alongside the bus. The image of the kid stays in his head and after lots of investigation he determines that the boy is homeless by choice and the step-brother of a school mate, Beatrice.<br /><br />Through his new acquaintences he becomes embroiled in an effort to save a group of burrowing owls whose habitat is threatened by the construction of a Mother Paula's Pancake house. The construction site has suffered a series of pranks and light hearted sabotage which has delayed the bulldozing of the construction zone.<br /><br />As an adult I appreciated that Roy has two loving and supportive parents to contrast the rather bleak homelife of Beatrice and her step-brother, nicknamed Mullet Fingers. The interactions between Roy and the bully Dana Matherson are hilarious. Hiaasen's descriptions of the Everglades and natural places are mystical.	2005-06-14

The characters and story begged to be listened to but the real star of this tale is the setting, Alcatraz Island in the year 1935.<br /><br />Moose Flanagan's family moves to Alcatraz when his father gets a job as an electrician/guard at the famous prison. Moose is homesick and lonely. He must take the boat to the mainland for school each day. His passion is baseball and the game helps him make new friends.<br /><br />His home life is more problematic.  His father works around the clock. His sister Natalie is autistic (although that condition is not identified) and subject to tantrums and unexplainable behaviors. His mother is so driven to get Natalie enrolled in a special school in San Francisco that she is blind to her son's needs.<br /><br />The unseen presence in the story is the gangster Al Capone who is imprisoned in Alcatraz.  The children of the island are fascinated, thrilled and terrified by the convicts. They are obsessed with catching a glimpse of Capone.  The warden's gorgeous daughter, Piper is the same age as Moose and seems to have a gift for getting him in trouble.<br /><br />Choldenko writes with great compassion of the challenges of living with an autistic family member.  You admire and ache for Moose as he shoulders the responsibility of watching over his sister when he could be playing baseball in the afternoons.  His kindness and love for his sister give the story extra depth.<br /><br />Johnny Heller's narration is excellent.  His voicing of Moose and Natalie are beautifully done.  Moose's voice answering \\"Yes Sir!\\" to the Warden has lingered in my mind.<br /><br />Interesting characters, the Great Depression and Alcatraz Island make this one of the most original works of historical fiction I have ever read.<br />Highly recommended.	2005-06-09

Written in a simple narrative style, Bethany describes her love for her family and surfing as well as her life before and after the shark attack. Living in Hawaii, she comes from a family of surfers. She discusses her faith in God and the strength she finds in her relationship with Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Her description of the events of that morning are the stuff of nightmares, \\"suddenly there was a flash of gray.\\" Bethany's father was awaiting knee surgery in the local hospital operating room when the news came in that a young girl had been attacked by a shark and the room was needed for that emergency. He said later he knew in his heart it was his daughter. The quick thinking of her friends and appearance of a paramedic on the scene helped save her life. There is no doubt though that her survival was miraculous. She learned later that she lost almost half her blood volume.<br /><br />In many ways she is amazed at the interest her story has generated. She does convey her deep faith and hopes that her experiences will serve a greater purpose and help others in times of trouble in their lives.<br /><br />She is just a kid so do not expect high falutin' prose but this is a touching story and the chapter that describes her return to surfing for the first time is quite moving.	2005-05-23

I do know that I will be thinking of Luther T. Farrell, his best friend Sparky and his \\"crew\\" for a long time.<br /><br />Luther is a bright thoughtful 15 year old with penchant for philosophers. His focus in life is to win the school science fair for the third year in a row. When not going to school he is thinking about Shayla, the love of his life since kindergarten. He works for (and also fears) his mother, known as \\"the Sarge.\\" He must clean up her rental properties after the tenants been evicted and take care of his crew of elderly men who live in one of his mother's group homes. He shaves them, feeds them and cleans up after them. Luther's wry commentary and outlook on life infuse the story with humor and poignancy.<br /><br />Luther is fully aware of the Sarge's deficiencies as a parent and human being but he accepts his life because she is putting money for college into an account for him in payment for his work and afterall, she is his mom. He understands that his mother has traded in her humanity for financial success as a loan shark and slum lord but he is naive about lengths she will go to protect her empire.<br /><br />Christopher Paul Curtis creates the most likable characters.<br /><br />(I have always felt like Bud in Bud Not Buddy was one of the bravest kids I've ever met in a book.) Luther is another great character. He treats his crew with dignity and kindness. He is totally clueless when dealing with Shayla and his exchanges with his best friend Sparky will make you laugh out loud. Sparky's goal in life is to achieve an injury that will result a cash award from a personal injury lawsuit. His harebrained schemes are hilarious.<br /><br />As the story unwinds, the reader is routing for Luther to find a way out and hoping for a softening of the Sarge's heart. The ending of the book is neatly done. You will cheer.<br /><br />Michael Boatman's reading perfectly captures the voice and spirit of the story. I highly recommend this audio book and I agree with School Library Journal that this story would be best appreciated by readers grade 8 and up.and spirit of the story.

Gavin is the oldest and loutish in his treatment of his younger brother. Ellie is very close to Will and sides with him against Gavin even though she senses a streak of kindness in the older brother.<br /><br />Will has a gift with horses so when it is time for him to choose a Great Horse he forgoes a large destrier and selects the smaller \\"blood red\\" horse named Hosanna. The horse emanates a sense of well being to everyone it encounters.<br /><br />The landscape shifts to the Holy Land when Gavin, Will and their father answer King Richard's call for a crusade. Will and his horse lift the morale of an army that is suffering from terrible battle loses and hardships.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Kamil, the ward of the Muslim leader Saladin is seeking revenge for the death of his father at the hands of a Crusader. Saladin counsels him to abandon his hatred and follow his faith. Will and Kamil's paths inevitably cross and Hosanna is captured by Kamil. Hosanna presence works its magic on Kamil and Saladin's army too.<br /><br />War changes everyone and everything. Gavin, Will, Ellie and Kamil must learn to live with loss and survive.<br /><br />Christianity and Islam are represented very respectfully. A faithful Muslim, Saladin's generosity to King Richard's army is heart-felt and based on fact. The Crusaders' pilgrimage to Jerusalem to see the True Cross is very moving and underscores the religious fervor behind the Crusades.<br /><br />The horse Hosanna is presented more as a mystical talisman instead of a full fledged character (my standard for horse books now is Seabiscuit) but this story is about young people coming of age and the human characters are very well developed.<br /><br />The army's trip to the Middle East by ship and the reality of battle are accurately depicted. The descriptions are grim but not grisly, PG-13 not R.<br /><br />This is Book I of a trilogy. I will anxiously await the next book. I want to know how these kids are doing.risly, PG-13 not R.

Junior high and high school libraries would do well to include these books in their collections. This version of Romeo and Juliet has lovely and romantic illustrations by Dennis Nolan.  My favorite is the balconey scene which folds out vertically and shows Juliet at the top of the page and Romeo is looking up at her from the bottom.

As the Germans invaded Poland, thousands of refugees flooded into Lithuania begging for visas that would allow them to travel to safety. Despite repeated orders from his government, Sugihara signed travel visas around the clock and saved thousands of Jewish lives. He followed his conscience knowing full well the social and professional consequences that would follow.  The drama of the events and the courage of Sugihara and his family make this true story unforgettable.  Dom Lee's sepia tone illustrations complement the story and convey the desperation and fear of the refugees and the bravery of the Sugihara family.	2005-05-02

Steve is the name a family gives to a special tree in their yard. Over the years it holds swings and hammocks, turns jump ropes, acts as third base, appears in family photos and shelters their home.  The tree watches over the family as the children grow and change. Steve's \\"last trick\\" will make you gasp in dismay. There is solace for the family (and us) as Steve's spirit lives on.<br /><br />David Catrow was exactly the right person to design this book. His illustrations are a perfect balance of humor and pathos. I love the dog.  Alan Zweibel is a gifted television comedy writer but this is his first children's book.  He must be congratulated. He has crafted something quite wondrous and fine.	2005-04-28

I am a fan Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" books but have not read many of his other works. Trolling through the audio books at the library I came upon the first book in his Sally Lockhart series. I remembered how much my oldest daughter enjoyed the series so I picked it up. Now that I have finished it I will just say that I could listen to Anton Lesser, the narrator, read the phone book. His performance is outstanding.<br /><br />The story set in Victorian England, is full of atmosphere and mystery. Sally Lockhart has learned that her father has perished on a sea voyage. Arriving at his business to get some answers, she asks the company lawyer about a cryptic message she received, \\"Beware the seven blessings\\" and he drops dead on the spot. In the days that follow, Sally realizes her own life is in danger and she must go into hiding.<br /><br />Mysterious messages, the opium trade, a priceless ruby and the grimy backstreets of London are all part of a puzzle that Sally must unravel. Through her efforts she also unlocks a memory and a door to her own past.<br /><br />Narrators of audio books vary in their ability to connect with the material and readers. Sometimes a reader's forced characterizations and mannered accents get in the way of the story or put me off the book altogether.<br /><br />Anton Lesser's reading of this story was dead on perfect.  Lesser is an accomplished actor and his reading of this story was so engaging.  The various characters were voiced perfectly. I want to \\"read\\" the next two sequels to this book but I plan to seek out the audio versions which Lesser also narrated.<br />The story was fun--4 stars, the narration was terrific--5 stars.<br />I highly recommend this audio book.	2005-04-25

Upon his arrival he falls very ill with bubonic plague and when he awakes from a fevered sleep he is no longer in the present but back in time in Elizabethan England. He is an actor in this lifetime too and he meets and works with the real William Shakespeare.  Through their relationship, Nat finds help in the 16th century with his life in the present. This is a title that boys who read fantasy enjoy although this new cover art puts guys off this title. Susan Cooper has written for the theater and collaborated closely with actors. She honors the traditions of the theater with this book.	2005-04-25

As the berserkers arrive to pillage and burn his Saxon village, Jack and his young sister Lucy are abducted by the frightening Norse men. Jack must develop his fledgling skills as a bard to save them both.<br /><br />The story is rich and steeped in Norse mythology. A reader who is a fan of Tolkein senses the professor at his elbow as the story unfolds. Under the protection and enslavement of Olaf One-Brow, Jack attracts the enmity of the evil Queen Frith and must embark on a quest to free his little sister from the queen's death sentence. He is accompanied by a wiley crow named Brave Heart and his glory-driven shipmate, Thorgill.<br /><br />So many interests came together for me in this book, Beowulf, Tolkein, Norse mythology: this was a very enjoyable read.	2005-04-22

There are plenty of bad guys with guns in the story but Alex has to rely on his intelligence and wits to get himself out of trouble.<br /><br />Horowitz knows how to move a story.  The fast pace and story action will keep readers turning the pages as quickly as they can.  This series should greatly appeal to guys who like action movies and things that go boom.	2005-04-21

Naomi and her brother Owen are happy and well adjusted children being raised by their grandmother. Naomi  loves carving animals out of soap. Her brother Owen is a brain.<br /><br />Like all children she is curious about her parents who are not part of her life. One day the children's mother, \\"Call me Skyla,\\" appears and lavishes attention on Naomi. Skyla barely hides her revulsion over Owen's physical problems resulting from birth defects and does not appreciate his keen and sharp mind.  Gram's misgivings  are confirmed when Skyla announces she wants to take Naomi to live with her and her boyfriend in Las Vegas. Naomi realizes that she is only wanted for support money and to be a babysitter for the boyfriend's daughter. Her hopes for a happy ending with a loving mother are dashed.  To find help for the upcoming custody battle, Gram takes the children to Mexico in hopes of finding the children's father.<br /><br />This story line seems dreary and tragic but the the characters are so tenderly and finely drawn that we cheer their strength and courage.  Naomi comes to know herself and finds her gift as a carver at the Christmas festival in Oaxaca.  The reader cares deeply about this family and is thankful to Pam Munoz Ryan who created them.

The events surrounding the death do not make sense to him so he begins an investigation of his own. As Alex uncovers the truth about his uncle's work, he is drawn into the world of MI6. As he works to unravel the mystery of his uncle's final days he must use all his smarts and skills to stay alive.<br /><br />The action includes cool gadgets, explosions, car chases, parachute drops and karate kicks. This is a terrific choice for guys who want lots of zap, pow, and boom in their reading.<br /><br />Boys are yearning for books with action and are ready to move on from the wizard/magic stuff.  These are books that will engage their interest. Of course they are echoes of James Bond but those movies and books have kept people coming back for decades.

As the young people come of age they are assigned to their occupations.  Jonas is apprenticed to the Giver, a man who holds the memories of the world as it really was with all the color, joys and sorrows of life. He passes these memories and sights on to Jonas.  Jonas's first experience with color is an amazing piece of writing.  Jonas comes to understand the truth about his society.

Novels provide an safe avenue for family discussions about important issues.<br /><br />At some point in high school students will read George Orwell's 1984. The Giver is an introduction to the concept of a dystopia. I am so glad my children had an opportunity to read Lowery's book before grappling with 1984.	2005-03-21

The King is amused and enthralled by Kate's tales until the last one and all her work is about to be undone until an astonishing secret is revealed.<br /><br />Hudson Talbott's illustrations are a riot of color and action.

In her novel, \\"Nory Ryan's Song,\\" we knew when the blight had overtaken the potato crop because we could \\"smell\\" it.  In this book we sense the crowded streets, the cooking in the tenements and the soot from the fires of Brooklyn in the 1870s. The crowding, disease and long back breaking hours of labor that were part of  the immigrants life are accurately depicted.  The joys of the her new land include her first taste of ice cream, a new friend, Johann, and her niece and nephew.  Dina longs for her home and family in Germany but finds she cannot imagine leaving her new family and friends.  She takes great pride in her talent for hat and dressmaking and ultimately makes a place for herself in her new country.

Indigo makes his first real friend, Tom, an American living with his British grandmother for the term. In many ways this is Tom's story as much as Indigo's. Tom is in England to escape the realities of his father's remarriage. He is a gifted guitarist and longs to purchase a special guitar at the local music store. Indigo's sister, Permanent Rose, latches on to Tom and considers him as much her friend as her brother's. She is determined to get that guitar for Tom. The rest of the eccentric Casson family returns from the earlier novel. Oldest daughter Caddy is at university and besieged by suitors. Adopted sister Saffy and her friend Sarah are fiercely protective of the family members. Permanent Rose is trying hard to engage their mostly absent father in the family's life. Their dottie mother, Eve, is enjoying more artistic success than her husband but cannot manage to keep groceries in the house.Helen Lederer's narration of the audio version is excellent.<br /><br />This is another wonderful visit with characters that seem so real they are like my own dear friends.

Something happens and suddenly he is on the stage of a theater (the Globe?) and William Shakespeare is tripping on his soccer ball.  The chase is on through old London.  The boy liberates a bear from a cage, a baron from the Tower of London, and dances with Queen Elizabeth I on a barge on the Thames, all while being pursued by a cranky Shakespeare.  The drawings are detailed and change perspective.  One moment you are running through the streets of London with the boy and the next you have a view of him and the city from high above.

In his wounded state he has his first vision of tiny blue creatures that seem to be feeding off his life force. He is rescued by a band of misfits who call themselves the Supernaturalists because they alone can see these energy parasites and are committed to destroying them. Cosmo joins their group and devotes himself to their cause but all is not as it seems. What are these strange creatures and what politics and dynamics are at work in his new family?<br /><br />Colfer is terrific at plotting fast-paced action-packed stories. He has a real gift for dreaming up amazing techno-gadgetry. His Artemis Fowl books are full of technical wonders. Even in his book \\"The Wish Lis\\"t he has St. Peter and Beelzebub talking on very high tech cell phones.<br /><br />A former student who saw me looking at this book at the library made a point to tell me it was one of the best books he had ever read.	2005-01-16

Like \\"Chasing Vermeer,\\" the book is about a puzzle that must be solved, in this case there is a treasure to be found.<br /><br />Thirteen year old Ellsworth lives a nomad life with his father and his fish, Hugo. He receives a birthday card from \\"some kind of cousin\\" named Elizabeth who invites him to visit for the summer. All that he knows about his father's family is that his dad does not want anything to do with them. Never the less, he is intrigued by her reference to the puzzle of the \\"last\\" treasure and despite his father's misgivings leaves for the Square in Smith Mills, NY.<br /><br />As Ellsworth gets to know more about his family he also learns more about his parents and especially his mother. With a distant girl cousin his age named Jess he tries to solve the puzzle of the last treasure house. My favorite part of the story is where Ellsworth and Jess read the journal of their great grand-relative and get to know him by hearing his story in his own words.<br /><br />I was overwhelmed by the number of names and relationships. There is a family tree and a map of the Square in the front of the book; I should have referred to it more often. I think it is a bad sign when you have to work extra hard to keep all the characters straight.<br /><br />An ok read but I cannot see how it made the Bluebonnet list. It is interesting for kids to think about family histories, genealogy and even recording their own family stories.	2005-01-09

I have just spent the afternoon with the most entertaining, warm, funny, and unusual people; they are the Casson family. In 152 pages, McKay has created characters I want to spend more time with and get to know better. Cadmium is the oldest girl and is learning to drive and pass her \\"A\\" levels. Indigo is the brother who dreams of exploring the Artic. Rose is the youngest who shows an affinity with paint as an infant.<br /><br />We meet Saffy in the terrific opening sentence of the novel, \\"When Saffron was eight, and had at last learned to read, she hunted slowly through the color chart pinned up on the kitchen wall.\\"<br /><br />Through her exploration of a painter's color chart the story of her adoption into the Casson family is revealed. She learns that she was born in Siena, Italy and brought to England by her grandfather when her own mother died in an automobile crash. Although the focus of the story is on Saffy's search for her place in the family, the rest of the characters are so wonderfully drawn that the reader feels a personal connection with each one of them. The way the family members interact and care for each other is touching yet tremendously funny too.<br /><br />Caddy's driving lessons (and her crush on the driving instructor) are hilarious. I laughed and laughed as I read. Indigo's valiant attempts to conquer his various fears are profoundly moving. Rose is a no holds barred artist. Her realistic view and handling of their father and his dismay at his unconventional family is cheering.<br /><br />I sought this book out when the Junior Library Guild chose \\"Indigo's Star\\" as a selection this fall. Lucky for me, I will get to spend another afternoon with the Cassons now.<br /><br />Stop what you are doing right now: order it, place it on hold at your library, or go out and buy it! You will thank me.	2005-01-01

I loved it and could not wait to get back to it when I had to put it down.<br /><br />Matt Cruse was born in the air, he only feels truly himself when he is aloft in the airship Aurora. Matt knows every strut and dial of the ship. It is his home.  He becomes friends with Kate, a wealthy young passenger who is retracing her grandfather's balloon journey  and is in search of the fantastic flying \\"beings\\" he wrote about in his journal.<br /><br />A pirate attack, a shipwreck, scary flying creatures that they dub, \\"cloud cats\\" keep this story moving and kept me turning the pages until the end.<br /><br />Matt is an interesting character who is still coming to terms with the death of his father and his new feelings for Kate.<br /><br />Oppel makes you feel the movement of the ship, smell the sweetish odor of the \\"hydrium\\" gas, and feel the heat of the island. The time period is seemingly in the past in the era of the great luxury liners but the idea of hydrium and the Academy where ships' officers are trained have a futuristic feel.<br /><br />Great job.

Wick is perhaps best known for his \\"I Spy\\" books but here he is demonstrating his incredible talent with a science subject.  He captures the essence of a water drop, the nature of steam, the momentary existence of a soap bubble and a snowflake in exquisite beauty.  He shows us what our own eyes cannot fathom.  Use this book to teach and learn about the water cycle, states of matter or art appreciation.  The book pairs wonderfully with \\"Snowflake Bentley\\" by Jacqueline Briggs Martin.	2004-12-18

Though happy in her life, Annika dreams the dream of all foundlings, that one day her missing mother will arrive and explain why she deserted her little daughter.<br /><br />She has many friends including a lonely old lady who shares the story of her life through beautiful but seemingly worthless costume jewelry.<br /><br />Annika has a gift for cooking and food is deliciously described in this story.<br /><br />One day Annika's mysterious mother does show up. She seems to be everything Annika ever dreamed of and she sweeps her daughter off to a decaying and crumbling estate in Germany.  Compared to her simple life in Vienna where she was always warm and well fed, here the rooms are unheated and the food is served cold. Annika happily offers to help out but she is reminded she is now an aristocrat and may not cook or clean.  Her only joy is working with the gifted stable boy who cares for the one remaining horse on the estate.<br /><br />Old Vienna is wonderfully described from the Lipizzaner horses to the Sachar tortes!  Kevin Hawkes is the illustrator of choice now for Ibbotson's books.  His fine detailed drawings throughout the story are a treat for the reader.<br /><br />Like \\"River to the Sea,\\" this story is rich in atmosphere with great characters and a very exciting crisis and escape that satisfies completely, sort of like a bite of rich, chocolaty Sachar torte!	2004-12-13

In the year 1941, Holland has been under Nazi control for a year. Ten year old Piet dreams of following in the footsteps of his hero, Piiim Mulier the skater who first achieved Elfstedentocht, the Eleven Towns Race.<br /><br />When a family friend is taken into German custody Piet's grandfather asks the boy to take the threatened family's children, down the frozen canals, to safety across the border to Brugge, Belguim. They are hoping three children skating down the canals will not attact the attention of the German troops. The journey becomes Piet's Elfstedentocht. The cold, the exhaustion, the fear and the natural exuberance of the children are beautifully shared in this story.<br /><br />Niki Daly's illustrations have an old fashioned feel. Daly has caught the feeling of the Dutch winter sky and the era with muted colors.<br /><br />Interesting notes on the Elfstedentocht are included along with pronounciations of the Dutch words. Another wonderful book about Holland during WWII is \\"Forging Freedom\\" by Hudson Talbott.  These two titles would work well together.	2004-11-17

The story of John McCrea and WWI flows through the book, interspersed with lines from the poem, \\"In Flanders fields.\\" It discusses the significance of the date, November 11 and supplies interesting details from the period.  Over two page spreads Wilson also interprets lines from the poem with lovely paintings that fill in more information about soldier life.<br /><br />This book is very popular with kids who like nonfiction \\"war\\" books.<br /><br />Cultural references to this poem abound.

Mikey greatly admires his step-father, Bill.  He is proud of the confidence and trust that he has earned with his hard work for Bill's charter fishing boat business.  When Bill offers to adopt Mikey, we feel the boy's happiness. He does not like their new charter customers though and Mikey's peace of mind is crushed when Bill makes a decision in favor his family over ethics.<br /><br />The ending of the novel does come as a jolt but the more I have thought about it, the more it speaks to me.  Young people view the world as very concrete, and it is difficult to come to terms with the hard choices adults must make. It is painful to understand the failings of people we love. What Mikey decides at the end of the story would make for a terrific discussion with young people who are just beginning to make personal decisions about their lives.<br /><br />A fifth grade student told me recently that this book was his favorite Texas Bluebonnet book so far this year.	2004-11-09

Sophie's family has disintegrated around her. Her self-centered sister is at college and her father is divorcing his family to marry her roommate. Sophie's mother, Edith, is too busy being \\"one with nature and the cosmos\\" to defend her rights (or those of her daughters) in the divorce proceedings. As her world falls apart, Sophie has to find her own center and hold on for dear life.  She has to become a family of one.<br /><br />Her goofy mother, selfish father and self absorbed sister made me wonder if Sophie was adopted.  Cooney has written a book that does mirror the confusion and pain that kids feel when parents separate.  Even though Sophie and her sister are young adults, they still need their parents.  I just wish Cooney had let the bulldozer finish the job.	2004-10-31

Once I started reading it, I did not want to stop.<br /><br />Willy Wilson does not seem to fit in with his family. He feels like he never lives up to his parents expectations. When he is offered the chance to spend the summer with his interesting and fun Aunt Bridget he jumps at the chance. Aunt Bridget is sewing an order of 30 gorilla costumes and recovering from the death of her husband. Willy settles in to life in her apartment which is across the street from Gill Park.<br /><br />Music is an underlying theme to his stay and the book. Music plays continuously in Gill Park and the different styles become the rhythm of his life.  One day the music suddenly stops and the news spreads that the eccentric owner, Otto Pettingill is going to sell the park to shopping mall developers.<br /><br />The book has a great cast of characters who are determined to save the park. Willy grows and gains confidence in the events that follow.  Baseball games, an elevator to a tree house, gorilla masks, a wild girl, violins--this is a very unique story line with an upbeat message about the difference individuals can make in their community.	2004-10-15

The size, the cover design, and the gorgeous illustrations make this book a delight to hold in your hand. The story is told by Seaman, the Newfoundland dog who accompanied the Corps of Discovery on their journey across the continent. Seaman's story is echoed in entries from Meriwether Lewis's journals.<br /><br />The book is not long; at 64 pages it would make a great read aloud. I loved the story where Seaman is dubbed a \\"bear-dog\\" by the Indians. His nearly fatal encounter with a wounded beaver is very exciting and invests the reader emotionally in the story.<br /><br />This book is not a history of the expedition but would be a wonderful introduction to the Lewis and Clark journey. Sacagawea and York are part of the dog's story but Lewis is the center of Seaman's world.<br /><br />The book would not be the same with out the rich paintings by Michael Dooling. Dooling is one of the best \\"realistic\\" illustrators working today. His painting of Seaman and Lewis looking out over the Pacific captures the sense of the entire expedition. We see them from behind looking toward the future of a new land, open and wild, with more to discover.	2004-10-14

It can be difficult to communicate the horror of those years to young readers without delving into atrocities and concentration camps. Gifted writer Karen Hesse has brought us a true story that can be shared in picture book form.<br /><br />The opening lines of the story set the scene, \\"The cats come from the cracks in the Wall, the dark corners, the openings in the rubble.\\" The \\"Wall\\" is the wall around the Warsaw Ghetto. In 1939, the German Gestapo crowded Jews into this area of the city where the horrible conditions caused starvation, disease and death.<br /><br />The young narrator of the story has escaped the ghetto and is \\"passing\\" as an Aryan on the other side of the wall. She fears for her friend Michal who is still inside the ghetto. Her sister, Mira is part of the Resistance and they have a plan to smuggle food to the people behind the wall. When the Germans find out about the plan and move to thwart it, the Resistance turns to the abandoned cats of the city to save the day and the food.<br /><br />Wendy Watson's illustrations are lovely. Her style and color palette take us back to this time period. Seeing the pictures of the merry-go-round and the holes in the wall was especially evocative having just read Milkweed by Jerry Spinelli.	2004-10-14

The setting is London and magicians run the country as members of Parliment. The amulet is currently in the possession of one of the most powerful \\"politicians\\" in England. Who is this apprentice magician and why is he dabbling with powers beyond his years? Bartimaeus doesn't care, he just wants to fulfill his mission and be released. As the story unfolds we see the story though the kid's eyes and through the wry asides of the djinn in footnotes. In this society magicians may run the government but there are non-magic anarchists who are causing problems.<br /><br />The reader is drawn into this world. Nicholas is a very young but talented apprentice to a \\"master\\" who is a second rate magician/politician. Nicholas has known very little kindness in his young life and is impatient to advance his learning. Bartimaeus is a funny and saavy djinni who admires Nicholas in spite of himself.<br /><br />Even as the story concludes there are big questions that remain. Who are those street kids who seem to \\"sense\\" magic items and remain unaffected by it? Thankfully this is The Bartimaeus Trilogy and book two, The Golem's Eye has just been published, September 2004. I must get it now and see what happens next.

People told me they had not liked the movie as much as the book. Not having read it, I did not fully appreciate their comments or passion. Now I have read Seabiscuit.<br /><br />This book is a triumph for Laura Hillenbrand. Her writing is compelling and beautiful. She draws fine portraits of Charles Howard, Red Pollard, Tom Smith and Seabiscuit himself. Through her artful storytelling the reader sees the horse's personality as clearly as the other players in the tale.<br /><br />Hillenbrand's reenactment of the match race with War Admiral must be the most exciting eleven pages I have ever read. The tension, the anticipation, the fear, the cheers and pandemonium of the crowd are brilliantly crafted. As a reader, I was there, in the mind of trainer Tom Smith. I was then seeing the race through the eyes of the jockey, George Woolf, who, interestingly, suffered from Type 1 diabetes. Finally, I was shrieking deliriously with the crowd as the horses pounded around the track.<br /><br />This amazing book will go on my favorite-books-of-all-time list.

This time he is a suspect in the disappearance of the Hibbins cats. Feeling completely misjudged, Ike mails his owner pleas and updates from the police station where he has been taken into custody. Forced to flee and on the lam, he attempts to solve the mystery of the cats' disappearance as well as a series of canary burglaries.

James Wilby is absolutely brilliant as a narrator. His character voicings are delightful and his pacing is perfect. I cannot imagine reading this book now without hearing his lilt.<br /><br />Meg Finn knows she is taking a step toward the \\"dark\\" side when she accompanies Belch Brennan on a burglary of old Lowrie McCall's \\"granny flat.\\" The episode results in her death and the next thing she knows, she is hurtling down a tunnel towards a light ... and a fork in the road. The blue auras are streaming towards St. Peter, the red ones towards Beelzebub. Meg's aura is \\"purple.\\"<br /><br />St. Peter and Beelzebub consult together on their secret cell phone (this exchange is hilarious) and decide to return her to Earth to clarify her color and ultimate destination. Meg must help old Lowrie McCall with the unresolved issues in his life by assisting him to accomplish four wishes.<br /><br />Their relationship is fractious, she is a young teen and he is a man with a bad heart and many regrets in his life. As we listen and the story develops, we feel the bond and affection developing between the two. I don't know how it will turn out. There are many hazards in their path, including the return of the very stupid Belch who has been sent by Beelzebub to thwart Meg and Lowrie's chances.<br /><br />This book is so funny and entertaining! When the main character died in the first chapter, I wasn't sure I would enjoy the story.  I loved it. The end made me cry! Very touching.	2004-09-09

Rodzina is with a group of orphans that is being sent out West on the Orphan Train. Rodzina is grumpy and grouchy. She is also frightened and lonely.  Unlike the other orphans in the group, she came from a happy home and had loving parents.  She is drawn to Miss Doctor who is in charge of the girls on the train even though she seems uncaring and cold.  Rodzina does have a gift for organization and caring for younger children. Some of my favorite parts of the story are where she tells stories to the lother children. She is a wonderful storyteller.  The children's desire for a family is touching and heart breaking at the same time.  Rodzina is looking for a home and you cheer for her as she reaches for it. I am a fan of Katherine Cushman, this is my very favorite book of hers so far.	2004-08-24

Nolan's own self confidence improves as he takes control of his life. Van Draanen's writing is fast paced, smart and funny. Once I started the book, I HAD to finish it. At 144 pages it goes quickly.<br /><br />This would be an interesting read-aloud and could spark some terrific discussions about civility, kindness and tolerance. Many books about bullies are heavy handed and flat. This books addresses the subject with great humor and a light touch.<br /><br />Nolan, (Shredderman) has the power to do enormous good, thankfully there are more Shreddermans coming.	2004-08-12

Maia leaves the security of her boarding school to live with relatives in Brazil after the death of her parents.  She is hoping to find a loving family and is apprehensive about leaving everything she knows to live along the wild Amazon River. Her courage is further tested when she meets Miss Minton, the serious governess who is traveling with her. The wildlife, color and scents of the Amazon are thrilling her.  Unfortunately her new family smells like bug spray and they live in fear of the very Nature that amazes Maia.<br /><br />The story has some fun characters, Clovis, a young English actor longing for England, Finn, a mysterious and exotic boy who lives in the jungle, and a Miss Minton, a governess who recognizes Maia's sharp mind and nurtures it.  The comical twins, Beatrice and Gwendolyn,  are the proverbial \\"ugly stepsisters.\\"<br /><br />The story has an old fashioned feel to it, in the best sense.

We read the book with our own knowledge of the events of the Nazi invasion yet we see the events through the eyes of a young boy who really does not comprehend what is happening to his country.<br /><br />The only name he knows to call himself is Stopthief because he survives by stealing. He is a child utterly and totally alone. He is given the name Misha by another boy who befriends and protects him. Misha's family becomes a group of homeless orphan boys scratching out a life on the streets of Warsaw.<br /><br />Misha is totally innocent, ignorant and naive so he only lives in the present. As we read of the Nazi invasion we know the horrors ahead. Misha, however, sees the \\"Jackboots\\" as something wonderful; he perceives their mocking salutes as a mark of respect. Their parade entering the city is a marvel to him though events he witnesses finally lead him to understand that being a Jew is dangerous. He is living with his friends in the the Warsaw ghetto. Behind the walls, his kind heart and small size allow him to sneak out and smuggle food back in for his friends. The reader fears for Misha though he feels no fear for himself.<br /><br />We ache for the child and adult searching for home and kinship.<br />Spinelli allows the reader to hear, see and smell the insanity of the Holocaust. This is a book everyone should read. This story is timely, important and compelling.	2004-08-08

The character Mia, in \\"The Princess Diaries,\\" complains that she is invisible. What if you looked in the mirror one morning and really could not see yourself? That is what happens to Bobby. He can see the towel he is holding but not himself.<br /><br />A great scene follows when he goes to the kitchen to talk to his parents who do not even realize he is invisible for a few minutes. Mystified by his condition and worried about what might happen if he is found out, his parents tell him to stay home while they figure out what to do. When his parents are in a car accident Bobby has to fend for himself. He begins to move around the city, relishing his invisible and \\"au natural\\" state. He visits a library and makes friends with another teenager named Alicia who does not know he is invisible because she is blind.<br /><br />It is a terrific and imaginative story.

It definitely has a place in an elementary library though it is important to remember the medal on the cover does not mean it is a match for all readers nor all age groups .

She also does something very sensible, intelligent and believable in the context of the story. She TELLS a trusted teacher about her situation and concerns with her \\"uncle.\\"  Even better, the teacher believes her and tries to help. So often as a reader I wonder why a character doesn't just TELL someone they need help. The background of the Native American folktale is terrific.

US	50945788	R9N5SSL6PVUFK	0439372941	194317773	Chasing Vermeer	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Something for everyone	What a fun mystery. There seems to be something for everyone.It has secret codes, mathematical puzzles (pentominoes), a dash of art history and good characters. There is even a coded message/puzzle in the Bret Helquist illustrations. Codes are always interesting to kids. I think this book will be very popular with middle grade readers.  I can see Calder and Petra collaborating on future mysteries. Kids who enjoyed The Mysterious Matter of I. M. Fine by Diane Stanley, will be happy to have a new and interesting mystery to read.	2004-06-27

Alice Tuckfield witnesses her father's murder and is now in fear for her own life. Where can a young girl alone in the 16th century hide? How can she disappear? I just love this book and plan to reread it this summer. This story is full of music and history and sends you back to another place and time. An interesting look at life in the cathedral choirs.  It makes me want to visit York someday. If you get hooked on the time period you can go on and read King of Shadows by Susan Cooper (love it) and The Shakespeare Stealer series by Gary Blackwell.	2004-06-27

I think it ranks up there with \\"Ender's Game\\", another story set in a hypothetical future. Matt knows he is treated differently. He discovers he is the young clone of an evil, all powerful drug lord. Why was he cloned? What do people want of him? Matt is bright and resilient and the reader's heart aches and cheers for him.  Can't stop reading it.	2003-05-01

This book touched all our hearts.  Mary Pope Osborne's retelling of the Mose tall tale evokes humor and empathy.  Mose is a firefight whose strength and courage has saved countless lives.  One night they go out on a call to fight a fire at a hotel.  Mose works all night carrying people out of the hotel to safety. In the morning as the firefighters wind up their hoses to go home they realize Mose is not there. One of the firemen asks \\"Where's Mose?\\"<br /><br />When I read this story,I pause there to let the implications of that question sink in.  As it does, the listeners' expressions are so moving.  I hear whispers of \\"Oh no!\\"  If you can get through the rest of the book without a a choking voice you are made of sterner stuff than I.<br /><br />We are all grateful that there is a little bit of Mose in every firefighter who climbs a ladder \\"toward a blazing sky.\\"	2002-09-14

The Bodger family is on a quest around England to find Pooh's Enchanted Place, Toad Hall and other places from classic British children's books.  In addition to enjoying their literary discoveries, I enjoyed Joan Bodger's descriptions of the special challenges of traveling with young children.  Food, laundry, and places for their children to play are as important as locating Beatrix Potter's farm.  While reading this book I felt as if I were  on a  vacation with some very good friends.  I loved this book.	2001-01-07
