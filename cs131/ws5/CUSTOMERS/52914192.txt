US	52914192	R3JO8EDFRPJ5LK	1594480001	659516630	The Kite Runner	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Absolutely Stunning	I picked this book because Amazon.com recommended it to me. And I have to say that this is one of the best books I have ever read.  <br /> <br />The story is profound and sometimes brutal, but nevertheless real and stunning. The portrayal of friendship between Amir and Hassan, what have happened between them, and Amir's journey of redemption to his homeland, leaves me speechless. I think the last time I cried so hard over a book, was when my beloved character died in \\"Harry Potter and The Order of Phoenix\\". <br /> <br />This book makes me want to savor each page and when I get to the end, I get that feeling that I just have one of the most wonderful rollercoaster rides ... <br /> <br />PS: If you want to see a great movie that deals with Taliban government, watch \\"Osama\\". A powerful movie ...	2005-07-29

She just buried her 3rd husband few months before, she is broke and desperate. Sugar Beth intends to search for a specific painting her aunt left her in order to raise the money she needs. Unfortunately, Sugar Beth doesn't have a good reputation in Parrish, she makes a lot of people hurt during her time there. Including her former girlfriends - the Seawillows - and Winnie Davis, who is now married to Sugar Beth's ex-boyfriend. They are all lined up for a revenge. But worst of them all, is Colin Byrne, a man whose career Sugar Beth simply destroyed 15 years before. Colin knows Sugar Beth is back and he is ready to use every imagination he has -- he is now afterall a sucessful non fiction author -- to bring Sugar Beth to her knees. <br /> <br />I must say that I don't really have any expectation with this book. I love Ms. Phillips' books but her previous two books -- since she moved to hardcover cavalery -- dissappointed me. I was ready to put her off my must-buy list but I decided to give Ms. Phillips another chance. I am glad I did. This book reminds me why I love Ms. Phillips' stories. The characters are so easy to fall in love to, including the secondary ones. Sugar Beth is one amazing woman. She makes amends of her past and goes through all with dignity. And even if Colin looks mean the in the first place, it is delightful to read how he finally sees Sugar Beth behind the walls she has built then falls in love with her. <br /> <br />It is a beautiful comeback to me and I start to believe in Ms. Phillips again. So, just like one of the reviews in this book, from Chicago Daily Herald, I just want to say, \\"Welcome back, Susan!\\"	2005-03-13

I don't buy the story, there is NO chemistry, the road to the relationship is flat, and like one of the reviewers here, the \\"supposed-to-be-hero\\" in this book CHEATS on his wife, he treats her quite badly, and suddenly he is ready for marriage?!? <br /> <br />Please!!  <br /> <br />Not to mention the wrong spelling of Dylan Taber's character from \\"True Confessions\\". This is her own character, for Pete's sake. <br /> <br />There is no scene in this book memorable enough to stay in my memory. It's pretty much out flat like her previous book, \\"Daisy's Back in Town\\". I'm sorry but I think I must take her out of my to-buy list.	2005-03-12

It's poignant, delicate, touching ... reading it feels like having a soft velvety whisper of air on your skin. Each character grows on you that you feel like you know them very well.

As the story unfolds, it gives us the amazing relationship between Henry and Clare: love, happiness, joy, longing, yearning, anguish ... between a time traveler who goes in and out of time and the woman he loves who always wait for him to return to her side.

She adds more suspense to her story. And I enjoyed it.<br />I can't say that it's her best -- my favorite is still &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot; ... in some scenes I think the 2 main character just fight too much. However, Ms. Freethy handles it nicely. Plus, all the scenes about San Fransisco is very vivid and make it wonderful to read.	2004-03-21

Eleven years ago, Dave promised Lisa that whenever she needed help, all she got to do was call him. Now, Lisa is asking Dave to fullfil that promise. So, Dave drives seven hundred miles from Tolosa to Mexico, to save the woman he never forgets. Then soon, the rescue mission becomes a tempt to survive from people who wants to kill both of them. <br />FLIRTING WITH DISASTER is the third book of DeMarco's family, which starts with I GOT YOU BABE (John's story) and WILD AT HEART (Alex's story), and it is definitely getting better. The story is packed with great suspense, action, and darn good-hot-and-sizzling romance, that includes a \\"hot and sexy way to enjoy tequila\\" scene. Secondary characters are also well written.<br />Definitely one of my all time favorites. I can't wait to read the next book coming out next year, which will be about Sandy DeMarco, entitled LIGHT MY FIRE.	2003-12-14

She is my favorite author when it comes to family stories. She always manages to write such beautiful, heartwarming, and also real family stories. The joy, the tears, the fears, the loyalty ... they are always there, knotted into one amazing story. She did it again with SUMMER SECRETS. Each character stands out with their own self. The sisters are uniquely different with one another but nevertheless, united with a strong bond called &quot;family. The romance of course, is also beautiful. I love the chemistry between Tyler and Kate, also Ashley and Sean. I just wish Caroline will get her own man. This book is wonderful read ... if you don't know Barbara Freethy, you're missing such a talented author!	2003-07-12

I was so engrossed with the story. It was really exciting to see the development in Harry's life, how he dealt with anger and frustration after what had happened to him in the 4th book. The death of the character (which was my favorite character from Harry Potter) was so sad for me, but I think J.K. Rowling had her reason.<br />Now, how long should I wait for Book 6.	2003-07-04

In fact, I just discovered this series 4 months ago when I bought the omnibus version. But, I've been catching up and I found myself drawn into this lonely complex determined man.<br />In &quot;Lost Light&quot;, Michael Connely wrote from the first person point of view. The result was it took me deeper into Harry Bosch's thought, as he tried to unravel an unsolved case. He was retired from LAPD but he hadn't lost his beliefs and spirits of finding answers. And along the way, he crossed path with some old friends ... former partner Kiz Rider, the reporter Keisha Russell, the FBI guy Roy Lindell, and his ex-wife Eleanor Wish.<br />I agree that this must be the &quot;lightest&quot; Bosh story, compared to the previous eight. However, it was absolutely great still. The ending did brought a light gasp to me but the again Harry was now 52 and somehow I was relieved knowing that he found his way home at last.<br />Like with &quot;City of Bones&quot;, I don't know which direction Michael Connelly will bring Harry Bosh in the next book ... but I surely hope I'll be there to see it.	2003-04-27

I enjoyed reading each characters, and of course, the the love stories. Callie and Jake sparked all the way. Lana and Doug were lovable. Heck, I even liked Digger!! Great one liners (\\"No coffee, no brain. I'm lucky I can speak in simple declarative sentences\\") ... some crackled me up. And I loved the the last 3 pages ...

She even now having a joint account with Luke. But then, when Becky and Luke go back to England for Suze and Tarquin's wedding, Luke throws a big surprise. He proposed!! And suddenly everything gets hectic! Becky's Mum wants her to get married in Oxshott while Luke's mother wants her son to get married in New York Plaza, with a extravaganza wedding. Now Becky is facing a BIG dilemma (letting down her Mum or letting a Vera Wang wedding dress goes by!) as she has to choose, which side of the Atlantic where her wedding would be.<br />Oh, goodie, Becky Bloomwood's back!! I'm a fan of the previous Shopaholic books. So when I saw this U.K edition of the newest Shopaholic book, I grabbed it without a doubt. And this book is as hilarious as the first two!! Becky was not doing much shopping in this book, but she did put herself into big trouble. She found out that two weddings are arranged simultaneously in Oxshott, England and New York City!! <br />It was fun to see how Becky tries to deal with it. Not to mention there were a lot of things happen in her life at the same time too: Michael Ellis (her American friend from \\"Shopaholic Takes Manhattan\\") got a heart attack, Luke had a midlife crisis (in the age of 34 *grin*), her new friend, Danny, almost got her fired, her newest client, Laurel, couldn't think of anything else but having revenge on her cheating husband and mistress, and of course Suze was having a baby!! This is one hell of a book to read. In some chapters, I couldn't even stop giggling. Such as when Becky was reading passages from \\"The Promise of Your Live\\", a book she bought to help her making wedding vows (\\"You helped me through the pain of rehab ... Though you are incarcerated for murder, our love will shine like abeacon ...). The new characters introduced here were all exciting.

One great thing about Conelly is how he managed to write such a beautiful but kind of quiet ending. How Harry stood in the rain waiting for the cab. It was lovely ... it was sad ... and again I must say it is surely one of the BEST Bosch books so far! It surely better than the last one (A Darkness More Than Night) which did not have enough Bosch.

And the one who will seal his fate as the murderer is the woman who despise him the most. <br />Valerie Parker is a PI working to find evidence of a cheating woman. The problem is, the cheating woman is now dead, and the suspect is the man that she swore never speak to again.

Then somehow, Valerie get shot and Alex has a feeling that it must have something to do with the fact that she is the prime witness. So now, they both work together to clear his name and protect her life from the real murderer. As they work together, the also find out that the old sparkling attraction they have five years ago is never really gone.<br />I love this book! I have been waiting for its release since I got my hand on Renee and John's (Alex's brother) story in \\"I Got You, Babe\\". Alex made an appearance there and I couldn't wait to read his own story. Alex is a very tough guy. Some of his friends joke that he is Superman. He intimidates a lot of people, except Valerie Parker. She is a smart and independent gal who drives him crazy all the time. It's very sweet to see Val challenges Alex every step of the way, arguing with him, and to see how Alex realizes his feeling for her despite all that. <br />Jane Graves also put a sweet story of the secondary character Stanley and Glenda. Although, the only DeMarco family appear here beside Alex is his youngest brother Dave and his cousin's wife Brenda(Brenda always put a smile to my face). I hope this is not the end of The DeMarcos. I really want Dave to have his own story ... He's a single father and also a patrol cop. His story will be very interesting.	2002-10-18

I found this book dark, as it was dealing with child abuse, domestic abuse, drugs, gay, and AIDS. However, I also found it as a good read. The life of the 4 friends forming a rock group, Devastation, was a different angle, but nevertheless made it interesting. I also love how Nora unfolded Emma's life as she struggled to be a strong woman, despite the tragedy that happened to her little brother and the abuse that she suffered from her own husband, and accepted Michael, who have loved her since his early manhood. This is a beautiful saga and should not be missed.	2002-10-05

I started reading this at 3 A.M. in the morning and finished 3 hours later (I'm always a fast reader when I'm into a book I love *smile*) with a smile on my face and a tug in my heart. John is such a delicious sweetheart and Renee is no pushover. I also enjoy the whole DeMarco family. I can't put this down ... and I'm surely can't wait to read Alex story (John's big brother) in October and to meet with the whole DeMarco family again.	2002-07-27

And boy, am I glad I took the recommendation! This books is great. I skipped reading Nora Roberts' True Betrayal for this one, something rarely done 'cause it's usually the other way around.<br />Okay, although I do not agree with one of the reviewers, here, (the bad guys ares very clear from the start!!) I fell in love with Matthew, Hurricane Chloe, and of course, I adored The Muses: Charlotte, Willie, and Irma. The three of them kind of reminded me with the Ya-Ya sisters ... no, not the book, I haven't read the book. The movie, I mean. Maggie Smith will be perfect to play cool and self-composed Irma. Also, this book set in Vienna ... very nice change of view. And come on, who could resist a book that starts with \\"So tell me dear, have you ever actually had multiple orgasm?\\" <grin> This book offers great romance ... can wait to read others buy Ms. Davis.	2002-07-21

I didn't agree with Publisher's Weekle review that said &quot;the credit card and shopping bag action is wearing dangerously thin&quot;. I mean, you're in New York, what else can you do but shop? I might probably do the same thing. The ending was soooo sweet. Let's hope that Ms. Kinsella won't stop Becky and Luke's story and will make the 3rd one.

Diamond Bay is just a few of Linda Howard's early books that I manage to have. I enjoy this story very much. A little disappointed because it's not thick enough *smile*. <br />I agree with one of the reviewer that Kell Sabin is probably the core of characters like John Medina. A shadowy man.

Susan Elizabeth Phillips is one of my favorite authors and she is the kinda of author whose books I always buy, automatically. I have been waiting for this particular book for almost 2 years since I live outside US and I can only afford buying the paperback edition. However, after I read it, It did not really meet my expectation when I first heard the news about Kevin and Molly were going to have their own book.<br />I felt like something was missing from this book. Most of the scenes jumped so fast from one another and sometimes I couldn't even be sure if Kevin and Molly really DO love each other. There are few issues that Ms. Phillips did not explore, for instance why Kevin started to feel restless at the first place?<br />However, I'm can't say that I'm disappointed with this book (that's why I gave it 4 stars). Ms. Phillips still maintained her funny and witty writings. I laughed at loud at the &quot;baseball blood-bath&quot; scenes. Daphne the Bunny and Benny the Badger were great! I love how she wrote passages from Daphne books or article from Chik magazine to start each chapters. And I also love  to read about recurring characters like Dan and Phoebe (and the kids!!) from &quot;It Had to Be You&quot; also Cal and Dr. Jane and Rosie from &quot;Nobody's Baby But Mine&quot;. She also mentioned other Bonners from &quot;Dream a Little Dream&quot;, the Dentons from &quot;Heaven, Texas&quot; and a Traveller (which I'm sure it was Kenny) from &quot;Lady, Be Good&quot;. I still love Ms. Phillips' books and I'm totally waiting for her other novels.	2002-03-11

Night Shift, Night Shadow, Nightshade, and Night Smoke, are all wonderful. And yes, I think some chacacters here (Althea from Nightshade and Gage from Night Shadow) are probably basic characters for Eve and Roarke for in-Death series. I say basic 'cause they come out differently though. Eve and Roarke have harder edge than Althea and Gage and much more complex issues in their life.

At first I picked up this book because there are so many news about the sequel, Black House, so I wanted to know what the fuss was all about. And it turned out to be one of the best book I've read ever!! I'm not a big and loyal fan of Stephen King although I do own and read few of his books. I don't have the Dark Tower series ... I do have Hearts of Atlantis, which I think was great except for the 2nd story (boring).<br />I agree with one of the reviewer that the first 150 pages are a little bit slow. Well, actually, not until the chapter where Jack met Wolf that I started to tune in with the book. And after that I finished the whole story in just 6 - 7 hours.<br />This is such a wonderful book about a journey of a 12-year-old kid named Jack Sawyer to find the Talisman in order to save his beloved mother. And what a long and hard journey it had been for him... Friends lost, friends found, hopes lost, hopes found. It was beautiful. And there was a lot of times that I felt my heart squeezed 'cause I felt what Jack felt. I think I'll continue with Black House ...	2001-10-04

Then I picked up Lucy Sullivan and ended up with the same satisfaction. This one was a little bit different though. I don't mean that I hate it, I think this was as excellent as the other two that I've read. But the plot was much more heartwarming, especially since one of the character (Fintan) had Hodgkin's Disease. Some scenes were funny but there were times that I took a deep breath and sighed when it came to Fintan's condition. It was a great read ... and now I'm proudly declared myself as one of Keyes' fans	2001-09-11

And since this book has good reviews, I thought I would give it a try. And I ended up loving it. It was a romantic comedy, a light-hearted romantic comedy which I believe could easily be translated into a movie (with the right cast and director, of course)<br />Meet Smith and Ralph, two best-friend/flatmate who have been friends for 15 years. Then a woman named Jem comes along. She thinks that it's her destiny to be with one of the guys. And of course there's Karl and Siobhan from &quot;upstairs&quot; who also been together for years. What Siobhan doesn't know is that Karl has been secretly having affair with Cheri, the beautiful woman who at first can be catogerized as &quot;bitchy&quot;. So, Ralph falls in love with Jem, who thinks her destiny is Smith, who secretly obsessed with Cheri, who secretly having affair with Karl, who lives with Siobhan for years. And all hell's break loose on Ralph's Party ...<br />I totally enjoy this book ... especially for some crazy-comic scenes. Like when Ralph and Jem having &quot;Chili Challenge&quot; (five each-raw ones) or Karl pouring his heart out on his radio program, Drive Time (Karl's a DJ). And of course the scenes at the Ralph's party, which were totally hilarious. It deserved 5 starts and I would love to read Ms. Jewell's &quot;Thirtynothing.&quot;	2001-07-28

The second part of the Stockwell of Texas' series. I haven't read the others - but I sure will - but I LOVED this one. Rafe Stockwell, Deputy US Marshall, found out that his ex-girlfriend, Caroline Carlyle, was heavily pregnant. She dumped him 4 months ago and mentally counting he figured that the baby was his. Caroline denied it of course but Rafe was so certain and he wouldn't let Caroline raised the baby alone. After all &quot;a Stockwell took care of his own&quot; <br />I found out that I've been reading this book over and over. It was absolutely great and highly recommended. Rafe's determination to take care Caroline was genuine. He still deeply cared for her eventhough he didn't immediately realized it was love that he was feeling. Caroline's fear for loveless marriage was also real since she experienced it with her parents before. And nice to see other Stockwells appeared to show the family bond. I will surely buy the 1st and the rest of the series. I wanna know how it turned out anyway	2001-04-15

He doesn't care about royalty since he never consider to stay in one place for long. But then he meets the eye of Keeley Grant, Travis' oldest daughter. Her innocence rocks his world and for once, makes him think that it may be time for him to stop running and embraces his destiny. <br />It was really good to be back in Royal Meadows and met the Grants. And boy did I love this story. Brian was the first who set the challenge as he was attracted to Keeley. Then he found out she was innocent and it forced him to stepped back. It was fun to see how the hunted became the hunter as Keeley made up her mind that Brian would be her first. The scene where Keeley seduced him was entertaining. <br />And there was Travis and Adelia ... I loved to meet them again. In fact, my favorite line from this book came from Travis himself. &quot;I'll let you know when you're fired, Donnelly. Dee, we still have that shotgun up at the house, don't we?&quot; Gosh, it cracked me up!!<br />One thing that bothered me a little though ... since Travis and Adelia were first introduced in 1981, there's no way Keeley is more than 18 years old, right? Especially since she was the second child. But here, Keeley is more than 21 ... hmmm...	2001-03-13

But when the computer said the person who was suited for Hutch's Mom, Cassidy, Ty got the surprise -- and challenge -- of his own<br />The idea of a 10-year-old kid wanting a Dad for nine dollars was so cute for me. And I always love Day Leclaire's writing. She managed to create such a light-hearted and sweet story. The scenes Hutch created to make his Mom and Ty fell in love were smart, annoying, and adorable at the same time. I loved the way Ty handled Hutch since the kid was a little bit insecured, being very smart and all. And one of the best scenes in this book was of course when Ty had to convince his love to Cassidy. How did he do it? Hint: One of Demi Moore's movie title.	2001-02-23

She always manages to create characters that real, who are not flawless, and fill with insecurities -- which make them real human. And the new novel &quot;Just The Way You Are&quot; impresses me just like others. <br />We have Alli, a mother with 8-years-old daughter, who always feels like she could never compete with her older sister. There's Sam, who still, somehow, hangs on to the past and seems to take it for granted the life he lives now. And there's Tessa, a supermodel who tries to cover the pain of the past by locking them away from her mind. All three must try to deal with the problem so they can move on. With the help of a very good observer, who manages to see people behind his camera and find the real them inside, and an 8-years old girl who loves her family with all their flaws and mistakes.<br />I really love this novel so much. I finished it in 3 hours, unabled to put it down once I started. Jimmy's character is the one that I enjoy most. I believe in his opinion that eye is the window to human soul. And camera sometimes can capture the feelings better than our own eyes. He's the most likable characters from Barbara Freethy's novel I read so far - I've read 4 of them. And I also understand the strain in the sister's relationship - Alli and Tessa - as I have a sister myself. We aren't like them because so far, my sister and I are really doing fine. But I understand the jealousy, the feeling of insecurities, and that is why I feel so much closer to home with this one.<br />In the end, it's the lesson we have to learn as we grow old. We have to accept the people that we love, just the way they are.	2001-01-14

It was kinda  disturbing me ... also the idea of father and daughter's romance...kinda  disgusting. But anyway, still the story was fine. Webb wasn't like other  Linda Howard's heroes that I've read so far. He was more gentle towards  Roanna.

I loved Ethan's character from the first time (Sea Swept, I mean). He was the calmest of all Quinns and it was wonderful to  read his story with Grace. Not too much &quot;explosion&quot; between them  like Cam &amp; Anna or Phillip &amp; Sybill. But that's the way I liked it.  Ordinary, simple, but engaging till the very end.	2000-03-09

This one is a little better. I liked the way Mr. Koontz portrayed Bobby Holloway, Chris' best friend. He got more part than the first book,  eventhough I kinda missed Orson, the dog, since in this book he was  kidnapped. I finished this in two days -- would be one if I'm not jammed  with uni stuffs -- and I can't wait for the conclusion. Hope Mr. Koontz  will hurry up....	2000-03-09

I have read all those books from Mr. Lehane featuring Patrick Kenzie, Angie Genarro, and Bubba Rogowski. Still, I can't get enough of it. In this 4th installment, Patrick and Angie worked to hind a little-girl-lost. And  what a shattering ending! It was so damn good, I still couldn't get it out  of my mind. And great characters Mr. Lehane gave to us. How could you NOT  falling in love with Bubba...despite his hobbies of killing people. You'll  love Patrick's sarcasm and Angie is a fantastic woman. Dennis Lehane is  surely my favorite thriller writer...forget Grisham. You ain't see nothing  before reading Lehane's works.	2000-03-01

She doesn't need anyone (mind you, I must say, any man) to help her. That until she meets Ethan Booker, a charming medical examiner. They are forced to solve a  mystery together. I must say, I really enjoy this novel more than two other  Ms. Moore's works. I love the story especially Ethan's character who is  very funny guy. He has great sense of humor for someone who usually deals  with dead bodies. Not to mention the scenes are sometimes surprising, like  when the two of them get uhm...blown up together.	1999-07-14
