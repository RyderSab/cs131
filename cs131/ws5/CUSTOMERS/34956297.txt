The first few paragraphs were unclear to me.  By end of page 2 I was thoroughly hooked. It is  a story about an Aboriginal female who is brought to the son, of a criminal sent to Australia from England, as he is looking for a full time companion during his long days and nights caring for thousands of sheep.  She is scared to death, she can't understand his language, and he doesn't understand anything she tries to say.  Over a long period of time she learns to speak pidgon english and he learns to understand.  They have children of their own, and a long history of the family unfolds in all its glory and excitement.  This one of the best books I have read. And that is more than a thousand.  Give it a go you'll not be disappointed.	2004-03-09

IN GERONIMO I BELIEVE HE HAS TRIED TO TELL A STORY WITH JUST AS MUCH truth from both sides of the picture as humanly possible.  I have read many books about the Indian wars, many are fictional and many are non-fictional.  Brigadier General Crook was a fine officer and Brigadier General miles was also considered a good officer, but I prefer those who have deep feelings of humanity.  From this book I have taken the liberty of quoting the author as I think every ruler or President of every country should put to memory. And I think we might have fewer wars.  Quote, A young Lieutenant Davis says, \\"You get to bury quite a few men in the calvary. Don't you sir?\\" <BR>  \\"Mr. Davis,\\" said Lieutenant Gatewood,\\"men have been killing each other since Adam's sons. To die for an idea can be noble, but it would be a lot more noble if the men died for ideas that were true.\\"  Think about the fact that one side always thinks their right and the other is wrong. And remember that both sides think their right. Well let's stop starting wars with countrys just because we want them to be more like us.	2003-03-16

I had read Mattie some months ago, I thought it was one of the best stories ever, so I was expecting to much of Sallie.  Sallie is a good story however and I can recommend it to anyone.  I grew up in a town that had a residentual area just like Lizzie Jones. And I new every boy and girl from that neighborhood as we all went to the same country school.  My parents forbid me to go there and associate with any of them.  I did anyway cause some of these kids were nice and I had fun playing with them.
