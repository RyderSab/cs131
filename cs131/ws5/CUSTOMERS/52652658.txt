This book simultaneously talks down to the reader, while assuming he/she is very knowledgabe in international affairs and recent history.  It is a compilation of brief vignettes and anecdotes loosely tied into 293 pages.  Don't waste your time.  Read one of Ann Coulter's books instead, you'l get more out of it and enjoy it more.	2003-11-08

It doesn't appear to have been proof read, as mistakes such as having Saddam Hussein invading Iraq (probably meant Iran)and calling French President, Jacques Chirac, Prime Minister don't add to the scholarliness of this effort.  The reference notes are only indexed by page and the reader has to search for or conclude, to what they refer.	2003-08-28

Absolutely great book if you want to read about one of the truly fantastic madams of the recent period, read this!  She crowded more 'living' into her life than most people do in 6 lifetimes.  She had friends in all the right places, and knew everyone.  On her own from the age of 14, she was a quick learner and knew all the 'tricks'.  In fact, as she put it, &quot;We turned a good trick&quot;.  Had houses from Alaska to the bottom of New Mexico.  Top notch- 5 stars.	2003-03-28

The story is related in a highly readable, coherent, sometimes slow, but well documented fashion.  The question has to be,\\" How could something like this where dozens, perhaps hundreds of people had to know the official story was a lie, be perpetrated?\\"  This question is never satisfactorily answered, but the documentation that it did occurr is persuasive.  Unfortunately, the connection to government at the highest level is tenuous.  The ease with which the government silenced critics is scary, but quite adequately documented.  The unfortunate demise of Commander Wm. S. Donaldson probably lost the battle for truth and at this late date, any hope for truth to shine on this tragic event is probably gone.  I hope this book makes it onto the best seller's list, as I think it very adequately tells the story of a perfidious government that set out to deceive the people and succeeded.	2003-03-04

This is likely as good a recital of the Robert Hanssen story as could be reasonably expected.  Not nearly as interesting as the Aldrich Ames, book but the FBI isn't letting anyone inteview Hanssen so very little is becoming known.   The wonderful peoople who brought us Ruby Ridge, Waco, Richard Jewell, Win Ho Lee, etc. are currently into MAJOR, big-time, heavy duty, damage control and are using every device they have to limit more about this story getting out, so we may never learn much the secrets surrounding this, but this is probably the best of what is available.  The really sickening part of it is that they had evidence and probably should have caught him in 1990.On top of the Walker spy fmily, Ames, and now this It makes you wonder who is minding the store.	2002-03-27

This is nothing of the sort, but rather is a rather slim volume with comparatively little devoted to Robert Hanssen.  This tome seems disjointed and even when it makes a point it seems hard to understand.  e.g. pg. 93 he states \\"...only farmers climbing off a tractor are going to be more noticeable than me walking around my house.\\"  Is he implying that he(Hanssen) would like to be more noticeable or less noticeable?  (One would assume he would prefer less noticeable, but the implication is the opposite)<BR>There are many uncorroborated statements in the book, and there is no bibliography nor index which might possibly help to straighten things out.  All in all, I get the impression that this was a  hurry-up effort to strike while the percieved \\"Iron is hot\\".<BR>One good chapter is # 17, where the text is devoted to the clash between FBI Director, Louis Freeh and Bill Clinton over excesses emanating from the White House, which Freeh did not take lying down, and which some unspecified aide said Clinton \\"went nuclear\\" over when Freeh didn't \\"roll over\\", and acquiesce.<BR>The book plays somewhat to the prurient interest, in that it describes in two places how Hanssen and his wife collaborated to display her nude bod.<BR>Overall, this is a book I'd skip. I was disappointed.	2002-03-22

This is an excellent book that describes how bureaucracy and politics (foisted by the Clinton administration) has infected and destroyed the CIA, and why we hadn't a clue before the WTC disasters.  Author, Baer, was a field agent and seems to have taken pride in the job, but served under a succession of career bureaucrats who were primarily interested in making sure reports were filed on time, with very little concern regarding their content. He was one of a small handful of agents who spoke Arabic, and wasn't afraid to travel, therby putting himself in personal danger in performance of his duties.  Really good book.	2002-03-06

While it is probable that this is all true, it appears author, Richard Reeves, probably could find more to say that is complementary about Joseph Stalin than he has about Richard Nixon. If your inclination is to believe that Nixon was 'satan incarnate', this is the book for you.  The text comprises 599 pages, including introduction, prologue and epilogue, and the sum total that is complementary about Nixon could easily be contained in less than one short chapter.  He frequently offers opinion as fact, as, when he erroneously states that Nixon was wrong in his prediction that the public would remember Kennedy's involvement in the drowning of Mary Jo Kopechne. Reeves devotes very little space to Nixon's successes, but positively exults in his failures and defeats.  He states that there are over 40 mil. documents in the Nixon library, of which about 7 mil. are available to researchers.  He appears to have been interested in only that fraction which depict Nixon in an unfavorable light.  I was very disappointed in this book, which cannot be considered as an even, or unbiased, account of Richard Nixon.	2002-02-21

This is good one-handed reading.  The authors have put together about three dozen stories that cover the subject.  Of course some appeal more than others, but many get right \\"down there\\" and really get the juices flowing.  The stories mostly don't require a suspension of credibility on the part of the reader, and cover subjects that excite and titilate many who wouldn't want or have the guts or inclination to pursue.	2002-02-05

If you want to know the truth about the bombing of the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City, this is the source.  The author was one of the eminently qualified people who pursued the study of the bombing and produced this book.  It is well researched, well written, and quotes research by many extremely well qualified individuals, including several eyewitnesses and victims of the bombing.  The only qualification I would add is that it comprises 364 pages of fine print, with an additional 184 pages of pictures and supporting documentation. <br />You have not read the complete story until you've read this. The &quot;official version&quot;  is nothing like this.	2002-02-01

First of all, I am conservative.  Mr. Goldberg admits he is liberal, and his book is good and instructive, however his liberal bias is evident even when he writes about it.  For example, on p.56, he writes \\"I noticed that we pointedly identifiy conservatives as conservatives, but for some crazy reason didn't bother to identify liberals as liberals\\".  True!Actually, the media routinely identify many conservatives with additional expletives, such as \\"extreme\\", \\"right-wing\\", and \\"arch\\" conservative, in order to make them appear further from the \\"main stream\\".  Only once in the book (on page 59) he admits to the media use of the \\"arch-conservative\\" word.<br />I found his relating of the power of Dan Rather at CBS to be  informative (CBS had a V.P. \\"in charge of (pleasing)Dan Rather.\\") <br />In discussing the far-left feminist he says \\"McKinnon (Catharine) is the feminist ideologue who had famously implied that all sexual intercourse is rape\\".  She didn't imply it at all, she boldly stated it, and presumably wants us to believe it.<br />Mr. Goldberg's book is great for three chapters, but then he seems to have run out of anything to say, but that did't stop him.  With quite a bit more research he could have undoubtedly written a great book, but this isn't it.  Get it from the library, this probably isn't one you'll want to keep.	2002-02-01
