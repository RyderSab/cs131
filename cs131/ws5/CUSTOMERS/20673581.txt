In fact, it is the best book I have read in terms of explaining Chinese culture as x, y, z. It is said that everything you hear about China is true, but not necessarily where you are. This book includes valuable information that is true in most locations in China, not only the coastal cities, nor just Beijing, nor only in academic circles. The book is broken into two sections. The first half of the book contains general culture information about Chinese people which should be applicable to Chinese in general, no matter where they live in the world. The second half contains information specific to Mainland China and situations you may find yourself in there.<br /><br />A poignant example would be the fact that when Chinese people are visiting you and decide it is time to leave they do just that, leave. There is no extended time of talk after an initial, \\"I need to go soon,\\" rather they just stand up and say goodbye. This surprised me the first time it happened with some students but I quickly became used to it. I have read other books which recommend against reading books like this because they will only cause more harm than good. However, almost everything in this book was relevant to my time in China and if I had read it before I went my learning curve would have been shallower.<br /><br />I would hope that they will come out with a third edition of this valuable book. A few items are dated and China is changing so rapidly that some details are sure to be very different in the future.	2005-10-10

Hall exams how people interact and how they live together. He begins with an examination of the animal world and how animals share space. Although not directly related to humans it is interesting to know that crowding among rats leads to massive population decline.<br /><br />The book also deals with cultural differences in the use of space. Hall examines the French, German, English, Japanese, and Arab world comparing each with the American context and with one another. The concluding chapters look at the modern world and seek to explain the ways in which we must design our cities to reflect proxemics values. This is even more valuable advice today as American seeks to integrate more and more immigrants from very different cultures.<br /><br />Although a little dated this book is worth a read.	2005-10-10

As always, she is concise, witty, and apropos. The strength of this book lies in the author's ability to summarise the various theories and evaluate them. I particularly enjoyed her evaluation of Chomsky through the introduction of his grammar to \\"Jupiter's stick insects.\\"<br /><br />Jean Aitchison is quickly becoming my favourite linguistics writer for her ability to explain complex linguistics points with ease. Some mammals tend to be more articulate than others; indeed some tend to obfuscate rather than articulate. Aitchison is clearly more articulate than most.	2005-10-10

It includes all the drawbacks of phrasebooks while compounding the problem with a Lonely Planet pronunciation schema. A major difficulty is that most Chinese do not speak Mandarin but a local dialect. Even in the large cities there are many who do not speak Mandarin and although you may be able to make yourself understood, you will not understand them!<br /><br />This edition compounds this problem by basing the pronunciation schema on the Beijing dialect. Although theoretically speaking Mandarin is based on Beijing pronunciation, in actual practice they sound quite different. Add to this the fact that Chinese people are not expecting you to be mispronouncing Chinese with a Beijing accent and you have a recipe for disaster. I saw this first hand on the train last week. Some poor Canadian was trying to make himself understood. He had copied out sentences from this phrasebook and was trying to use them. Not only could he not be understood orally but the Chinese speakers had no idea what he had written down because they couldn't read it either. (Educated Chinese can read pinyin but not the Lonely Planet system.)<br /><br />The only advance made is that you can look up characters by stroke count. However, this is a negligible benefit as tourists have no chance of figuring out stroke counts and stroke order.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this book; it will only make your journey to China more frustrating.	2005-08-03

The book doesn't skimp on details although the action is fast paced and the character development is nil. Parents will probably want to talk over the themes of this book as torture and execution are mentioned although not in detail.<br /><br />Hark the Herald Angel is given the assignment of travelling through time and investigating the important events in Bishop Kivenegere's life. Children may come away with a distorted view of angels, but it is a neat device. Hark takes his trusty notebook and pencil along with a camera in order to record events.<br /><br />Overall, this book is sweet and overly short. More character development would have been nice along with some details about what happened to the couple and their daughter later in life.	2005-06-26

If this book doesn't keep you up until 3am desperate to finish, nothing will. It is divided into four sections: puzzles, origin, evolution, and diffusion. Puzzles deals with the theories as to how language began and developed. What was it originally for? and touches a little on the area of psycholinguistics. The second section deals with the issue of where it began on earth and how it spread out. The issues of the first chapter are expanded on and answers provided. The third section details the evolution of language based on what we currently know about language creation among the higher apes and among indigenous peoples who are exposed to foreign languages (pidgins, creoles). The last section deals with the diffusion we know today and with the idea of a universal grammar that would unite all human language under certain principles.<br /><br />As always Aitchison has managed to present a lot of information succinctly and without clouding the issues. A good introduction to the subject.	2005-05-20

The first half of the book contains exercises for one student and the second contains matching exercises for their partner. Most of the exercises are well thought out and useful. A few of them are dated as they refer to events and facts of the 1980s.<br /><br />The book is rated for students of an intermediate level. However, exercise difficulty ranges from fairly easy to more complicated and some students may be bored at times. Also note that the exercises are geared towards children and the subject matter is primarily junior high or lower. The content is also primarily Anglo although not overly so.<br /><br />Overall this is a useful book from which to get ideas. The main drawback is that every student needs a copy and they can \\"cheat\\" by looking in their partners section when they get stuck.	2005-02-28

Roach begins with an overview and then directs our attention to the production of speech sounds and the creation of vowels, consonants, and tones. He also covers suprasegmentals, acoustics, and the use of sounds to compliment one another in the creation of meaning.<br /><br />My only complaint with this book is its emphasis on the BBC accent. This alienates those who are unfamiliar with this accent or those from other areas who are concerned rather with their own accent. This critique could be broadened to include most of this Oxford series so this criticism is not particular to Roach.	2005-02-21

Although Widdowson is the editor of the Oxford Introductions to Language Studies series this book does not have the same feel as others in the series. The format is the same with a selection of readings following the author's introduction. However, this book seems to have been written as an introduction for experienced linguists. It contains all of the information but with none of the details that would make it a pleasant read for novices. Ultimately, trying to squeeze everything there is to be said about linguistics into 77 pages is an impossible task and makes for an unprofitable read.<br /><br />That said, the selection of readings is particularly strong and Widdowson asks some pointed questions of each author. It is at times very apparent what answer he expects because he goes on to ask questions based on what his answer would be. This would annoy those who disagree with him.<br /><br />This book only rated two stars because I expected more from the series editor. Widdowson seems to have missed the second word of the series title: introductions. Only those with a graduate level reading ability in the field of linguistics would find this book enjoyable. I would recommend Jean Aitchison's book instead (0340870834). It is highly readable and geared more for the novice.	2005-02-21

In rural Mississippi a ten year old black girl is beaten, raped and left for dead by two white punks. Although she survives the attack she will be mentally scared for life. The town is outraged but before justice can be done the girl's father takes an M-16 into his own hands and ensures that they are put away for good.<br /><br />Most of the book deals with the implications of having a child raped and of a father's desire to circumvent the \\"imperfect\\" justice system. Grisham pits societal forces against one another with KKK members facing off against black families supporting their own (A feature he will use again in The Chamber). The idea throughout is that if the case were reversed and a white father walked into a courthouse and shot to death his daughters attackers he would be found innocent of any crime. I find this truly unbelievable.<br /><br />My disappointment with this book is Grisham's portrayal of justice as being not justice but survival of the fittest: those with the quickest wits and most able lawyers. Ultimately justice is not done but Grisham leaves you with the feeling that justice is impossible.	2005-02-21

Deception Point is a fast action thriller written to the same formula as his first book, Digital Fortress. The main character, Rachel Sexton, has the same personality, drive, and abilities. The plot is similar enough that there are few surprises. The only major difference is that there is a greater assortment of supporting characters as more freedom of movement is allowed. In this novel the main character actually gets to leave her office building although this is based on a very flimsy premise. Sexton is sent to verify the NASA find in order to convince the White House staff of its legitimacy. I fail to see the logic in this.<br /><br />In Digital Fortress it was the NSA that was portrayed as evil incarnate; in this book both NASA and the Space Frontier Foundation join the ranks along with, ultimately, the NRO. I was left wondering if Brown really does dislike NASA, etc. and if in fact his novels are guided more by a political agenda than a desire for thrilling readers. At best he seems to consider NASA a misguided venture but fails to see a better way.<br /><br />Deception Point is a fast read and the chapters fly by (hardly surprising as there are 133 of them!). I read this on vacation and would recommend it for the poolside as you can interrupt the book at any time for a dip.	2005-02-21

Gallagher is a former Peace Corps volunteer who spent two years in Thailand. As a consequence this book has many useful things to say in relation to overseas living. This book is quite practical given its short length and experience of the author. The strength of the book lies in Gallagher's experiences and his ability to use that in aiding the reader. Its biggest drawback is its datedness. This is especially true of the beginning and of the stereotypes portrayed in the first chapter. Although these things may still be true in the broadest sense the expat/native relationship has changed in the last 30 years. The book is also very American-centric in its comments and may not apply to others venturing overseas.<br /><br />Overall it's worth four stars for being short and sweet.	2005-02-21

This short and to the point book is comprised of three sections: cultivating the possibilities, developing the relationship, and sharing the benefits. While quite short, Jones does a good job of covering the main points of what to look for in a mentor and how to develop that relationship. At the end of each chapter there are several questions for reflection.<br /><br />For those already in a mentoring relationship there are more detailed books available that will be able to assist with problems. This book is for those just starting out who want to know what mentoring is, where to begin, and what to do. I suspect that most people's biggest problem with entering a mentoring relationship is finding the motivation. This book is concise enough that most will be able to push on through and come away rewarded.	2005-02-21

The main character, Michael Murphy, is a biblical archaeologist whose main goal in life is to find historical evidence supporting the biblical record. His latest goal is to locate the brazen serpent that Moses crafted in the wilderness in order to heal the people from their snake bites. The antagonists want that same serpent for more nefarious purposes. This results in, among other things, the murder of Murphy's wife.<br /><br />This book needs about another 100 pages to flush it out. The pace of the action is breathtaking but a lot is left behind as a result. My suspension of disbelief meter was off the chart and because of that I would rate the book poorly in accomplishing its goal. Obviously LaHaye believes in the Bible and believes that it recounts true events but in writing such a poorly construed novel he undermines its credibility. Do Christians need to dream up such fanciful events to support their faith? Overall LaHaye fails in his goal which he states in a note to the reader: \\"fiction is a powerful way for me to share with readers some of what I find so completely fascinating about end times prophecies.\\" He could learn something from Marshal McLuhan who said \\"the medium is the message.\\"	2005-01-17

Most of the monologues are from rather pathetic people who were either wronged by others or who wronged others. The book concludes with \\"The Spooniad\\" which gives something of a story summary of the events that you have been reading about from the perspective of the various characters.<br /><br />My favourite part is comparing the monologues of the various parties involved in the disputes.

The first five chapters are concerned with the intellectual history of scientism. Sagan provides a full blown apologetic for the scientific method and harshly criticises those who have stood in its way. Those up for criticism are almost exclusively Christian and largely Roman Catholic. Whether the seminary student in Contact, or his constant vigilance against any form of belief in the Imago Dei, Sagan seems unable to escape the influence of religion. If you read Isaac Asimov's The Roving Mind you have read this.<br /><br />The second unannounced section of the book is concerned with the current state of scientific understanding of the universe. This is mostly limited to a discussion of the planets and moons of our solar system but occasionally deals with other star systems. As this book was published in 1994 much of cutting edge astronomy is long past this point. The pictures are therefore worth at least as much as the text. One criticism is that with so many beautiful pictures of the solar system available why did Sagan include so many paintings of what things might look like? Perhaps he had a secret liking for the Eastern tradition and included them as icons.<br /><br />The third section of the book deals with the human future in space. Sagan proposes that eventually humans must leave earth or face extinction. We will either destroy our environment or eventually be hit by a large chunk of annihilation. He therefore proposes various Sci-Fi methods by which we might attempt to colonise the other planets, the asteroid zone, and the larger galaxy. For good measure he throws in his SETI project which is the subject of Contact. On so many levels Sagan has replaced god with E.T. and this book is ultimately more politico-religious than scientific.<br /><br />Buy this book in large edition for the pictures and an entertaining story or buy a real astronomy book and go outside and look at the stars if you can still see them through the smog.ory or buy a real astronomy book and go outside and look at the stars if you can still see them through the smog.	2004-12-06

I have read A Painted House and Skipping Christmas so I was expecting something similar. Grisham does not fail to deliver on that score. The idea is not a new one nor is the story. We would perhaps expect Grisham to be writing a novel about how lawyers got involved in \\"the big secret\\" but this is a softer, gentler author.<br /><br />With their high school couch about to breathe his last the players return to small town America for a reminiscence session of high school days. This is centred on football of course with an odd cheerleader thrown in for good measure. What this story lacks is characters. Where are they? Grisham relies on stereotypes to make his point for him. Every character in this novel is a stereotype or at least we have to assume so because no development is done on any of them.<br /><br />The novel concludes with a resolution of \\"the big secret\\" and everyone goes on their way happily free from their pasts. This is particularly true of the main character whose life we have joined. Unfortunately, even he who all along we knew was destined to undergo much soul searching and angst is forced to undergo a stereotypical catharsis. Longer may have been better but it least it is a quick read.	2004-12-06

It has far more material in it than I expected. There are eight sections: special occasions, courtship and marriage, body language, enjoy, all in the family, let's have fun, red letter days, and the icons of America. Most of them are not customs per say but cultural aspects and oddities. It includes such diverse topics as the tooth fairy, separate phone lines for teens, and demolition derbies. Each topic includes an example of how it would be talked about. There is also a cartoon which is cute but unrelated to understanding the custom.<br /><br />The only real disadvantage is the language level. I would expect a book on this subject to have fairly simple English but this is far from the case. Of bedtime stories it says they \\"provide the stimulation so necessary for children's intellectual growth.\\" Also some of the explanations don't really capture the spirit of the custom: \\"Tupperware parties are gatherings where people display and sell versatile plastic products to their friends.\\" I think this definition would greatly puzzle someone who had never been to such a party.	2004-11-27

It is a classic of overcoming obstacles and provided many with their first realisation of what it means to be deaf and blind. It provides a wonderful look into her world and the world of 100 years ago. If there is one thing that sums up Keller's childhood it's \\"with love and many kisses.\\" She never seemed to tired of attention and was everyone's friend.<br /><br />The second half of the book (pages 105-225) is comprised of letters written by Helen from when she first learned to write up until 1901. The first letters are extremely interesting as we see her progression in ability and thought processes. Later on I became bored with the whole process and wished that there was some context to what she was writing about. A handful of the letters are explained by the compiler but most are just an exercise in reading someone else's mail and not terribly exciting at that. The story deserves 5 stars; the letters 2 stars.	2004-11-27

The idea of monochronic (M-Time) and polychronic time (P-Time) are briefly summarised as well. The underlying concept of Beyond Culture is that man is an evolutionary being and although we cannot evolve to adapt to our environment at the rate of insects we can continue to evolve through extensions. These extensions are the things we create such as fire and tools at the basic level and cars, computers, and mobile phones at the more complex level. In this way we have continued to evolve beyond the limits of our biology.<br /><br />In a similar sense, culture is an extension of our personal being and is used to prevent us from having to explain every little detail. Regardless of whether a culture is \\"high\\" or \\"low\\" it contains a body of knowledge that provides for ease of communication among members. He develops this idea in the concept of action chains which is a sequence in which several people participate. Culture is by its nature participatory and understanding action chains within a culture can help us to understand how to prevent ourselves from running aground in a culture different from our own.<br /><br />He also looks at culture and education and lampoons the current state of higher education in the western context. I find this somewhat unwarranted. He concludes with chapters on the irrationality of culture and our identification with culture. However irrational a culture may be to those who identify with it it makes perfect sense.<br /><br />I do not always agree with the interpretation of cultural examples that he cites but his ideas are interesting and can be helpful in understanding cross/intercultural experiences.

(The Twelve Candles Club, No 4)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Tricia's trouble delightful reading	This fourth book in the Twelve Candles Club Series focuses on Tricia and her trouble. Her father has moved out and she wants him back home again. On top of that two expensive paintings are stolen during a party where they are working. A lack of evidence causes the police to focus on the Club. Tricia and friends are determined to find the real thief and to trust that God will bring her family back together.<br /><br />Schulte's theology is evident throughout the book as Tricia is led to seek and trust in God for her family. Clearly aimed at 8-12 year old Evangelical girls, this book succeeds at blending life and spirituality without becoming too preachy. Her primary focus is on how to obey the commandment to honour your parents if they are not acting honourably. Tricia is angry with her father for leaving and cannot see why she should honour him. Shulte deals with this satisfactorily for the age level of the reader. The English level is excellent and obviously the author knows what she is doing in writing serial novels for this genre.	2004-11-17

This is followed by three chapters on using games in class and with different age groups. The final chapters tell how to create, adapt and make your own games and even how to store them.<br /><br />The strength of the book lies in the focus of each chapter being supported by specific games. Rixon will talk about a point and then introduce games that support it. This results in a pleasant read and not just a list of games or method with no illustration. The weakness is particularly evident in the final chapter: organising a collection. While good information, most readers probably would appreciate more on \\"how to use\\" rather than on \\"how to store\\" their games.<br /><br />Overall this is a nice introduction and can be ready quickly. The games are also realistic. Some should be familiar to all: \\"O'Grady Says\\"=\\"Simon Says.\\" Others are less well known or have been modified to be more useful in the language classroom.	2004-11-17

It is aimed at students with a fairly basic but comprehensive level of English. By that I mean it includes the play, \\"Marty the Martian\\" which involves a subject that you are unlikely to encounter. On the other hand it includes \\"On the bus\\" which is very practical in style. All of the plays were written by the author and have been field tested in her teaching. This is a positive in that they should work in real world situations. You will still need to be flexible within your own context though.<br /><br />Each play is accompanied by a list of vocabulary and followed by several exercises. Each play has a different set of exercises and focuses on a particular type of learning. In this way all the plays can be effectively used with the same group of children. Teacher preparation and involvement is crucial to the success of the plays as a learning tool. The exercises are only loosely based on the plays and they will not teach themselves.<br /><br />On a whole this is a worthwhile book and any teacher desiring to introduce skits into their classroom would profit from taking a look. However, the price is a little steep for what you get and those interested in this field might want to write their own specifically for their students.	2004-11-06

Some of the advice and scenarios are practical but others are completely in fun. My favourite was the advice of what to do if you are threatened with alien abduction. You should not let your mind give in to them. In other words, stop hallucinating and you will be just fine. :)<br /><br />At the same time some of the advice is practical and could be useful to everyone, not just travellers. For example it gives advice on what to do if your car ends up hanging over the edge of a cliff.

The NSA must recover the key or face the consequences of an unbreakable code being released to the world resulting in an end to their days of decoding missives.<br /><br />With more twists and turns than my broken washing machine this book makes up in action what it lacks in knowledge. At times, Brown's lack of computer knowledge comes through but overall it is more than passable.

Unfortunately, the book suffers from too many authors and/or revisions. The earlier sections read like a series of disjointed statements held together by too many footnotes that are unrelated to the topic at hand.<br /><br />The book is made up of four parts: Communication and Culture, The Influence of Culture, From Theory to Practice, and Knowledge into Action. The latter two sections are more cohesive than the first two. From Theory to Practice includes three sections on \\"cultural influences on context\\" that are somewhat helpful: the business, educational, and health care settings. However, they, or more accurately Stefani, have bitten off more than they can chew. The information is either too specific to be of general use or too general to be of practical use. Having multiple cultures with the health care setting is going to have a great impact on practice but so much is thrown together in the section that not much more is accomplished that making us aware that we need to be aware that there are many differences, something which seems to be self evident.<br /><br />The biggest drawback of this book is its failure to pay attention to the three areas that they call the primary areas of difficulty in communication: politics, morality, and religion. The following quote both summarises their feelings on the subject and demonstrates their method: \\"The danger of ethnocentrism is that it is strongest in political, moral, and religious settings. In these contexts, it is easy to let culturally restricted views overshadow rationality. Hence, we again urge you to be alert to narrowness and intolerance in any form\\" (251). Aside from being unhelpful there is the arrogance of deciding which cultures are rational and which are not. Many of the world's cultures have homogeneous political, moral, and religious beliefs. Are we to tell them they are irrational?  How does a western raised democratic person behave in a totalitarian country? All this to say that if these points are the most critical to communication between cultures should they not be dealt with?w does a western raised democratic person behave in a totalitarian country?

Note that the illustrations are purely for amusement rather than providing visual explanations of the idiom. Some of the idioms are more popular than others but overall a good selection has been made. Each idiom is explained in detail and with example sentences and a larger context.<br /><br />Older readers will want to spend their money on a more comprehensive idiom dictionary, but this is perfect for children and those who enjoy reading to them. My only criticism would be that the idioms are presented in context and the examples are written at a higher level of English than what the overall genre seems to suggest would be appropriate. This book could be used with older/more advanced learners because of this, but the publisher seems to have aimed a little wide.	2004-09-20

It was, therefore, a delight to find this book in a used bookstore here in China. It is everything the movie is and a little bit more. It closely follows the plot of the movie and adds a few more details from the life of Lewis to flush out our understanding of the characters. I am not sure if these are details from the life of Lewis or from the stage play script, but they are helpful in knowing them better.<br /><br />The downside to the book is that it goes no further than the movie in exploring Lewis or examining the events of his marriage to Joy. It provides just enough detail to make you want to read a true biography of this period of his life.<br /><br />Overall, the book fulfills its role as a move-tie-in but fails to deliver as a biography or as a serious look at Lewis' life and love.	2004-09-20

After buying 100 pineapple plants and paying to have them planted he is rewarded with years of fighting with the natives.

The nearby island of Assateague has long been the haunt of wild horses which are rounded up every July and sold in support of the local volunteer fire department. The two children are captured by the wild vitality of the horses and desire to catch the wildest of them all, Phantom, and make her their own.

It is classic children's literature at its best.<br /><br />The book is actually comprised of two stories revolving around the history of American trotters and the Hambletonian race. They are true stories and centre on the person of Gibson White, son of \\"Hambletonian Ben\\" White, and his horse Rosalind, the fastest trotter in history. The book begins with Gibson being confined to a hospital where he spends the next two years. During that time he reads the story of the first trotting horse, Hambletonian. That story is interspersed with the story of Gib's recovery and return to the horsing world. His horse, Rosalind, is a descendant of Hambletonian and rises to greatness as a racer. Although Born to Trot is named for Rosalind and her great speed, the characterisation of Gib as the hero who recovers from his sickness to rejoin the world he loves makes this story a great read for all.	2004-08-02

My only complaint is that in her material on reading critically she does not mention that all books need to be read critically including her own.<br />Those looking for an in-depth analysis of any one type of reading would be better suited to look elsewhere as her information is necessarily brief given the 100 odd pages she had to work with. For those looking for an introduction it will serve well. Although she does provide a bibliography it would be helpful if she included a list of further reading materials at the end of each chapter.

It does not read as an allegory even once you realise that he has found his maker after entering a crucifix shaped hole in the rock.

Mary is portrayed as a simple peasant girl who was thrown into the midst of God's plan for humankind. Similarly, any of us can choose to live such that we seek this miracle. Not one of divine impregnation in the physical sense, but an impregnation of expectancy of the work of Holy Spirit.<br />This book is divided into four parts: The Idea of Incarnation; The Maid and the Miracle; The Way Miracles Happen; and Learning to Grow with a Miracle. Hayford clearly believes that God works in miraculous ways and he includes several instances of this. This book is certainly not for those who discredit miracles.<br />An engaging book, but one that Roman Catholics will not appreciate because it portrays the humanity of Mary rather than her role as the theotokos. In particular he argues against both the immaculate conception and perpetual virginity of Mary. This is done to further his argument that Mary is similar to any one of us and we too can partake of this miracle.<br />As the subtitle states this book is about \\"receiving God's miraculous touch in your life.\\" For those who believe this is possible this book will be an enjoyable read. Those who find this notion ridiculous will no doubt not even attempt a read. Those who are undecided may just want to give this book a chance.	2004-03-22

I have two huge dictionaries: C-E and E-C but when I want to look up a word I always turn to this one first. It does not pretend to have everything, but nine times out of ten it has what I am looking for.<br />The first half of the dictionary is English to Chinese with the second half reversing that. The E-C section has the English word followed by the Chinese equivalent (if there is such a thing :) in characters, followed by the pinyin. For common words it also includes variations and short examples. This seems to be somewhat inconsistently done in terms of the amount of English included and/or pinyin. It assumes that the reader has at least a minimal grasp of Chinese. If they do not what are the expecting from a dictionary? Language cannot be equated word for word. You must study it in its cultural context.<br />The second half of the dictionary is arranged alphabetically by pinyin, tone and radical. In other words if you knew rice/meal was \\"fan\\" you would look up \\"fan\\" and then find the fourth tone section and then the character for rice. If you do not know the tone (always a challenge) or the character (a bigger challenge) it gets a little harder. Chinese is not a language designed for dictionaries. As with most Chinese dictionaries it is almost impossible for a non-native speaker to look up a character to find its meaning. It is an involved process of figuring out which stroke was first and how many there are and whether or not the character is single or combined with others. The radical index is well laid out and I have seen a Chinese locate a character in seven seconds with little problem. Anyone using this dictionary should already know that however, so I do not count it against the dictionary.<br />For the benefit of those who might buy this dictionary let me say what it is not. It is not an exhaustive dictionary. It is not designed as a textbook for learning new words. It is not a phrasebook for tourists.

Hayford begins with an introduction to the visitor and follows this with sections on his suffering, his wounds, his blood, and his death. It is written in the style that we have become accustomed to from Hayford and is a good devotional on the life of Christ and how it is to impact us today. It also includes many of his poems which are always poignant.<br />The themes of this book are nothing new, God's love and purpose for us, his wonderful power provided to us, and the life of Christ given for us to have full life. The book is not really focussed on the historical person of Christ but on his reality in Christian's lives today. As such Hayford is insightful and comprehensive, yet precise, in providing a picture of what that means to us.<br />I would recommend this book for those who enjoy reading contemporary literature on the \\"deeper life\\" or those who have enjoyed Hayford's other books.

Be warned, I have met taxi drivers who cannot read Chinese.<br />A major caveat is that most Chinese do not speak Mandarin but a local dialect. They mention this in the introduction but it could be stronger. Even in the large cities there are some who do not speak Mandarin and although you may be able to make yourself understood, you will not understand them!<br />There are a few problems with the book, beginning with several typographical errors and exclusions. This seems troublesome when you may be relying on it to get you out of a jam. Secondly, this edition includes a list of profanity with the caveat that if \\"you hear these words you should be on your way.\\" Users of this book will not know enough Mandarin to recognise what they are hearing and it seems an invitation for assault to consider using them yourself.<br />This book is excellent for those who are being tourists in Beijing or Shanghai for a few days but you will want to consider something more substantial if journeying around the country without a guide. If in doubt look for students, inevitably you will meet some who have studied English and are proficient enough to help you.	2004-03-05

Everything you read in LP China may also be true somewhere but unfortunately not always where you are. Originally published in August 2002 this book is well past its prime. It is still superior to the Rough Guide but could use a serious update. Speaking of which the overleaf promises guidebook upgrades on the Internet but they discontinued this in favour of user discussion.<br />Pricing - the cost of tea in China, you say? Like most things in China, prices are in constant flux and I question the value of including them. They are more misleading than helpful. Tourist attractions will generally be higher than what the book says but other prices will be close.<br />Locations - I live in the city of Wuhan and in the last two year it has undergone tremendous changes. There is simply no way for a printed book to keep up with them. For example, in the last six months the bus routes in WuChang have changed four times.<br />If you are going to travel around China be flexible! Expect that nothing in the guidebook will be where you expected. Expect to bargain for everything, hotel prices included. Remember that any guide book is only a starting place. As I have travelled around southern China I have used this book as a starting point and then asked the locals what they would do. Most have never been to the \\"tourist sites\\" but can show you a great street restaurant just around the corner.<br />This book is great for those thinking of going to China but who will never make the trip, or for those who are going on a package trip to fourteen cities in eight days. For those who want to explore China on their own I would advise caution.	2004-03-05

This collection includes Service's best known poems from Songs of a Sourdough, including The Call of the Yukon, The Shooting of Dan McGrew, and my personal favourite, The Cremation of Sam McGee. If these poems don't have you booking a trip to the Yukon, nothing will.<br />Service was a man's man, living in northern Canada in White Horse and Dawson. This gives his poems a rarefied feeling that cannot be counterfeited. If Louis L'Amour had lived in northern Canada he would have been a soul mate to Robert W. Service. They both loved the outdoors and loved the men of the outdoors. Perhaps the most amazing thing about Robert W. Service is that his life story is even more compelling than his poetry. To read The Men that Don't Fit In is to get a glimpse of the man who fits.<br />This is poetry for the soul that requires no degree in literature to appreciate.	2004-02-29

I am using it as supplemental material in a third year course on British and American news publications and I find it is well suited to the task. They are Chinese English majors and the level of English is well suited to them.<br />This book includes a wealth of basic information on researching and writing news stories and supplies copious examples. Furthermore it includes a CD which supplies additional information with real examples from such news events as the World Trade Center attack. It includes such sections as the traffic accident, obituary, court trials, business, etc. Furthermore, instructions are given on interviewing witnesses and the use of sources as a precursor to personal experience. At times it supplies too much information. Do university students really need to be told how to calculate an average?<br />Of further assistance are sections on the ethics of journalism. What is acceptable in terms of photographs to be published in a newspaper? When does a story become too graphic? That said, the implicit message is that more information is better than less and Mencher doesn't deal with the issue of invasion of privacy. In sum, it is not particularly self critical of the news reporting and writing industry.<br />Keeping in mind that this is an introductory text it is quite well put together. The sidebars are particularly helpful in keeping students' attention and everything a journalist needs to know is represented at least in embryo form. Finally, it is well within the grasp of ESL university students.	2004-02-28

I suspect he misses the thrill of writing The Hunt for Red October and Cardinal of the Kremlin. He certainly refers to the latter enough times although they never touch base.<br />I read the Penguin edition which is over 900 pages and disappointed me from page 200 on. The back cover states that \\"he quickly finds himself debriefing a Soviet defector with an extraordinary story to tell....\\" I am not sure what they mean by `quickly' but for me it meant sooner than page 800. I kept waiting for Ryan to interview the guy so we could get on with the suspense but it never happened. The first 700 pages dragged on repetitively and finally Ryan meets the Rabbit only to learn what they guessed 400 pages earlier - the KGB wants to assassinate the Pope. Off to Rome we go for a quick wrap-up and some linguini.<br />What was the point of this book? It wasn't suspense - we knew before we started that the Pope's life was in danger and that the Rabbit would convey that information. Hence we knew the Rabbit would escape the USSR. Certainly the conclusion couldn't have been the point because it lacks cohesion and any sense of suspense. Shouldn't we be worried about the Pope being assassinated? It seems that in writing about the past Clancy has become trapped in his alter ego of historian and tells this story as though it were history. History may be decided upon but suspense novels should create the illusion that anything is possible.<br />Even the small details of the subplot fail to find resolution. Clancy spends 20 pages complaining about the British medical system but we never learn the result of Lady Ryan's complaining to the supervisor about the other doctors going out for lunch in the middle of an operation and having a few beers. If you are going to include such vindictive at least make it appear to be part of the plot and tell us what happened.<br />This book made me want to read Cardinal of the Kremlin but I doubt I will bother picking up The Masque of the Red Death which will surely be the title of his next book. I'll stick to Poe. Overall a disappointing return to Clancy's past glory. They say you can never go home. Clancy tried but got waylaid somewhere in Bulgaria.will bother picking up The Masque of the Red Death which will surely be the title of his next book. I'll stick to Poe.
