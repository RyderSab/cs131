He is the premier example on what William Goldman called the \\"Supercritic\\". This is one who seems to always find merit in works the majority of his/her colleagues dismiss, and grandly dismisses works most others praise. It would seem, therefore, that he should be likewise easy to dismiss... except for two things. <br />First, even when he is tearing apart a much beloved film or praising some dismal exercise, he's, well, right! That is, his points are always on the mark and exceedingly well argued, This can hurt, albeit briefly, any future viewings of a favorite film, and, probably, enhance viewings of a \\"dog\\" (I say \\"probably\\" because life's too short to test out this latter proposition). Second, he is. without doubt or peer, the most brilliant, witty, and pithy writer on (pick your subject-he's written on them all) Music, Theater, Books, or, as in this case, Film, not only of our time but, arguably, of all time. <br />Sure he's uncommonly (and unnecessarily) cruel to those he dislikes, commenting not only on their abilities (fair game), but on their looks, intelligence, life-style, what-have-you. <br />And, sure, he can be so maddeningly erudite that you know he's using words and phrases whose meaning only he can tell. But, those words! That wit!

The breezily written accounts of these films are always fun to read and, if they don't \\"expose\\" many new factual mis-steps (How many film fans are there who don't already know how \\"fictional\\" the purportedly fact-based \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is?)they do offer intelligent, brief, discussions of films that (wonder of wonders!) actually merit them. One major quibble though: For a book that is dedicated to exposing falsehoods in films of all sorts, it perpetuates one of the greatest. This is not the first book that attributes the line from \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\" (\\"When the legend becomes fact, print the legend\\") to John Ford. Ford DIRECTED the movie. The screenplay was by James Warner Bellah & Willis Goldbeck, from a story by Dorothy M. Johnson. While it is notoriously hard to tell who did what in a film, one would think that the Screenwriters should at least be credited with the DIALOGUE!	2005-01-31

Equally as fascinating as the story the book tells, however, is the book itself. Consider: It purports to be a true story. But it purports to be the true story a a boy who made his mark by learning how to lie, swindle, and con gullibles marks by telling purportedly true stories. The characters in it are much too outrageous and colorful to have actually existed, But the characters are much too outrageous and colorful to have been made up. The town the story takes place in, Mineralton, Michigan, doesn't exist. But there is (or was) a Mineral Hills. The author is Peter Fenton and the main character's name is Peter Fenton, so it could really be a memoir and true. But Peter Fenton, the author, was a reporter for The National Enquirer, a publication known for, at the very least, coloring its stories when not blowing them up out of whole cloth. In short, the grifts, cons, and swindles Fenton describes in this delightfully funny book are real. But the question has to be asked: Are they all confined to the space INSIDE the covers? <br />Whatever the answer, the fun to be had in (and for) the asking is immeasurable.	2005-01-12

If you're British, and read, you probably know of Anthony Horowitz. He's more prolific than a rabbit on steroids. The problem is, most of his output is classified as \\"Young Adult\\", i.e. kid's books. DO NOT BE DETERRED! Sure his Alex Rider (teenage spy) and Diamond Brothers (Teenage & idiot private eyes) feature barely pubescent heroes. And, sure, literate teens, if that's not an oxymoron, will get a big kick out of the adventure stories, but the ones who will really love them are literate (and film literate) adults! The first book in the Diamond series was \\"The Falcon's Malteser\\" and if you need to be told what THAT was a take-off on, stop reading now. The second book in the series (only two have been released so far on this side of the Atlantic) is \\"Public Enemy Number Two\\" and to fully enjoy it you have to be familiar with no less a film than, wait for it, James Cagney's \\"White Heat\\". A kid's book? Based on a 40's film noir about a psychopathic mama's boy killer? If you can wrap your mind around that, and the numerous horrendous/hilarious puns and wordplay that Horowitz indulges in, then this is for you. Oh, and when you're finished you MIGHT let that literate teen read it. But get it back! These books are to be treasured. Oh (#2), the reason for only 4 stars is that I feel calling these books \\"YA\\" does the public a disservice.	2005-01-06

Bogdanovich, as he did with the great directors in \\"Who The Devil Made It?\\", has penned love-letters to some of tinsel town's greatest performers. As with the first volume, almost all of these pieces are told from the personal viewpoint of his inter-actions with each of the stars, a ploy that could become tedious in less capable hands. It is important to remember, however, that, before he was a director, and sometime actor, Bogdanovich was one of the best writers on the art of film, a talent he retains to this day. The pieces vary in length from less than 10 pages to an almost novella length essay on Jerry Lewis. The problem, if any, is that the short pieces often seem TOO short and the longer ones, especially the Lewis piece, could have stood a little trimming. But, all in all, these mash notes (you won't find many negative comments on any of his subjects) are beautifully written and speak of a time and place we shall never see again.

True, the books are heavily formulaic, but it's a good formula and one that movie buffs and nostalgia freaks will always enjoy. If this latest entry has a flaw, it's that the celebrity du jour is one of Kaminsky's lesser entries. I bow to no one in my respect for the prestidigitorial skills of Harry Blackstone (whose work I saw on the old \\"Ed Sullivan\\" show) but, compared with people like Bogart, Cooper, Bette Davis, Groucho Marx and Eleanor Roosevelt, he is definitely minor league. Making up for this deficiency are the chapter headings which feature a series of easy-to-do tricks culled from (apparently) a Blackstone radio series. And, while we're on the subject of deficiencies, it would behoove Carrol & Graf, Kaminsky's publisher, to invest in a proofreader!

Always opinionated, endlessly entertaining, the books have been about joy and they have spread it. Until now. Mordden sees the last quarter century of musicals as nothing less than a betrayal of all that has gone before... and he just may be right! To be sure, he finds some bright spots along the way. These, however, appear more and more to be like the stopped clock that is right twice a day! He, and I think most afficienados would agree, feels that the American Musical today is in the hands of hacks and it ain't gonna get better. The why, you may well ask, read this? Because it is so damned much fun! Wit and intelligence bounce from every page so that we realize that, in the proper hands, even a diatribe can be immensly entertaing! Books in the series published thus far cover the 20's, 40's, 50' 60's, 70's and this latest. Mordden WILL be covering the 30's in his final volume. One gets the impression that he held off so that his final work could return to his feeling of love for the art.	2004-10-01

Every once in a while, however, I write to correct a grievous wrong. Robert Rankin is the British author of over 20 novels few of which have even made it to this country; none of which have been given the credit they deserve. This is a crime against nature that makes global warming appear no more than a pin-prick. Most, if not all, of Rankin's work could fall under the rubric of \\"Science-Fiction\\". But that genre isn't nearly large enough to hold the mind of Robert Rankin. It is impossible, in so limited a space, to even begin to describe the plot of \\"Witches of Chiswick\\". Suffice to say it is about time-travel. But that's not the point. As Roger Ebert has noted about films (and by extension any work of art) it's not \\"what they are about, but how they are about it.\\" And, oh, how this is \\"about it\\". There has rarely been as funny, as inventive, as complex, as clever, as... well, you get the idea... as this. In fact, with the exception of the (later-in-time) works of Jasper Fforde, I can only think of a slew of books bearing the name \\"Rankin\\" that even come close. Will you like it? Simple test; here are some other Rankin titles: \\"The Hollow Chocolate Bunnies of the Apocalypse\\", \\"Nostradamus Ate My Hamster\\", \\"The Raiders of the Lost Carpark\\", \\"Armageddon the Musical\\". If these titles alone do NOT make you an instant fan who wants IMMEDIATELY to read the books, then, no, you will not like them. You will also be marked a wrong-thinker who should be drummed out of the literary establishment, but, hey! it's up to you.	2004-03-17

Thus, although they dwell in &quot;real&quot; time, they age about one year for every four the rest of us mortals face. This explains how Spenser, who has been around for something on the order of 20 years, seems at most about 5 years older (physically/mentally) than he was when the series began. More amazing, however, is that Robert B. Parker seems to age at about the same rate! This latest Spenser has all the drive, wit, style, and (OK, the word choice is not the best) spunk of any of the best of the breed. Using a fictionsalized Enron-type corporation as his starting point, Parker gives us all the fun and ferocity that are the hallmark's of the series. To be sure, as with any series, Parker has his ups and downs, but, like the girl in the parody, when he is good he is very, very, good, and when he is bad he's terrific (well, better than most, anyway).

Therefore, it is always a special treat to find one that brings a fresh slant to the subject. Jones' book does just that. By treating musical theater styles neither as a simple reflection of, nor an escape from the world at large, but rather as an integral part of the whole, he presents a broad, but always entertaining and on-target view of both the 20th century and musical theater's part within same. There are, as there always are in works of this scope, some factual errors (e.g. &quot;No Strings&quot; wasn't Richard Rodgers' only &quot;public&quot; credit as a lyricist. He's also so credited on the score for the TV musical &quot;Androcles &amp; The Lion&quot;.

His \\"Two O'clock Eastern Wartime\\" is an overlooked treasure that should be read by anyone who appreciates fine mystery/history writing.

Since it is, first and formeost, an academic work, some of the flaws are inherent in the genre (e.g. a highly repetitive introduction; little of the &quot;razzle-dazzle&quot; that fans of the musical have come to expect from books on the subject; a selective use of sources to prove her point-and a bit of stretching at times to make the selection do its duty, etc.). While I find it difficult to subscribe to the totality of her argument, and have serious questions about whether a given interpretation of facts is, indeed,  the most correct (or even intended)one the authors she discusses had in mind, I cannot fault her over-all premise as a POSSIBLE one. What sets the work apart, however, is NOT the whole, but the sum of its parts. Within the over-view, Most presents detailed examinations of a handful of theater works that often offer new insights to these works AS WORKS, whether or not one feels they ratify the over-riding concept. It is for these insights that I recommend the work to any lover of the Musical theater, regardless of race, creed, or religion.	2004-01-19

I was not disappointed. Both \\"Icarus\\" and \\"Gideon\\" were stellar suspense novels. The came \\"Aphrodite\\" and Mr. Gethers is listed as sole author.

(I still get a kick out of reminding my friends that a lobster is really nothing more than a glorified cockroach!) I have used his \\"People's Chronology\\" as a bible on any number of writing projects from trivia contests to advertising copy. And now he has compiled \\"The New York Chronology\\", once again exhibiting a mind-boggling grasp of hard facts and fascinating trivia. Since the book runs over 900 double-columned pages, I haven't read all of it. And that's as it should be. Sure, you could read it as a straight narrative, but the real pleasure comes from opening it a random, reading one or two entries, and being enthralled enough to realize you've gone several pages beyond your orignal intent. However, in a compendium this big, and this full, some errors are bound to appear. While there have been two or three \\"facts\\" that I have been a bit skeptical about, (were Romney Brent and Nigel Bruce REALLY both born in Mexico?) there is at least one I know to be in error. The \\"movie\\" entry for 1943 lists the Loretta Young/Brian Aherne flick \\"A Night to Remember\\" as being about the sinking of the Titanic. While there was a British film of that name about that tragedy, the '43 film was a comedy/mystery taking place in Greenwich Village. As you can see, however, the \\"flaws\\" I've uncovered thus far are almost exclusively in entries about minor subjects. They should not keep anyone from buying, reading, and treasuring this marvelous labor of love!<br />IMPORTANT UPDATE: 3 days later: Having delved more deeply into the chronology, I DO have to alert the reader to some more errors (alas!)

What was a big musical like this doing opening in a rickety, \\"temporary\\" theater W-A-A-y off-broadway? I couldn't get any reading on my friends' reactions during the show (which was performed without intermission) but, as the lights came up at the end, I saw that I had done good. There wasn't a dry eye along the row we had commandeered. We stood by our seats and raved as the audience filed out. It turned out to be a damn good thing that we did, too, as we were just one row in front of Kiley's wife! All of which is to say that I pride myself on having loved the show longer than most. Thus, I was thrilled to hear that this book was coming out. Then I got worried. What if it didn't live up to its subject? What if it told me things I didn't want to know? Sure, Dale Wasserman is a superior playwright/screenwriter, but that's not a BOOK (and if you think writing is writing, try some of David Mamet's novels... not his essays, which are brilliant, his novels).

Terry Cook being ably assisted in solving a tinseltown murder (or two) by none other than Humphrey Bogart. Atmosphere and ambience are first-rate, and Crider succeeds in the trickiest part of his conceit by actually having Bogart SOUND like Bogart, or at least our impression of him, throughout. As a mystery it's about a &quot;3&quot;. Astute readers will pick up on the killer fairly quickly if they apply Roger Ebert's &quot;Economy of Characters&quot; theory.

Mr. Timothy is, as we realize early on, none other than Tiny Tim Cratchitt, all grown up under the, probably less than we expected, tutelage of his &quot;Uncle&quot; N (for &quot;neezer). He is, at 23 trying to find himself after a life less than splendid, by taking up living quarters in a brothel in the seedier section of London (No, don't bother re-reading that.

Into his life comes, among other things, a child thief not unlike a certain &quot;dodger&quot;, a frightened (and with good reason) 10 year old Italian girl, several corrupt policemen, a one-handed body retriever, a &quot;Columbo&quot;-lik detective, and some of the most horrendous villains ever written. All of this is recounted in almost magical prose, with a period feel that few other modern authors even approach. &quot;Mr. Timothy&quot; may not be anyone's original idea of how &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; might continue, but it is absolutely true to the realities of the time and place in which it occured.

And what better way than to go back to the source, the original inspiration for Holmes himself, Dr. Joseph Bell? Thus we have seen the nascence of a new series of works with the brilliant, and very real, doctor performing as his later inspired fictional counterpart. Among the best of the practitioners of this new form (and arguably its progenitor) is David Pirie. He first presented Dr. Bell, deductive detective in a TV movie starring Ian Richardson. This was followed by the masterful and chilling &quot;The Patient's Eyes&quot;, a marvelous novel using the same ideas as the film and extending them to other cases. Now Pirie is back with &quot;The Night Calls&quot; and it is both more and less interesting than his first book. First the less part. The first, and largest, portion of the narrative is essentially a novelisation of the aforementioned film. Those who have not seen it will find it fascinating, but those of us who have will, I think, find it somewhat slow. The more is that it continues beyond the ending of the film which, without giving anything away, I hope, was curiously, albeit chillingly, open-ended. In any event, the book, and the series, provide the pleasures of marvelously atmosheric writing and intriguing characters in a highly entertaining blend of fact and fiction. Baker Street Irregulars and their ilk will love it!	2003-08-04

Some have been excellent such as Gerald Bordman's &quot;The American Musical&quot;, some dreadful (kindness forbids naming names, but you know who you are  Mr. Flinn!). And then there is one that is sui generis. Actually, that one is six. Ethan Mordden's six volumes, each covering a decade from the '20 when what we define as American musicals began through the '70's when, as Mr. Mordden mordantly beilieves, it ended. The genius of these works (really only one long work) lies in both its completeness (what other work on the subject would include &quot;Smith&quot;, a Don Murray starring fiasco of the early '70's?) and the brilliant evocation of each show in its time and place in American theater and culture. Mordden manages this feat even for shows he couldn't possibly have seen unless he's old enough to make Bob Hope seem a comparative teen-ager. I am not stating anything radical when I say that this is NOT a book to everyone's taste. We can't get people to GO to musicals anymore, let alone READ about them. But for those who care, this is THE one to read.	2003-06-06

Richard Schickel's memoir of life and movies during WWII, is a book that not &quot;only a film scholar could write&quot;, but one that only THIS film scholar could write. To those of us of, as they say, a certain age, it offers a fascinating re-evaluation of the films of WWII, as well as a compelling portratit of growing up in America at the time. Indeed, if the book has a flaw for those of us old enough to remember the films in their original release, it is the lack of precise dates of release of many of them. HOWEVER, one does have to ask (and my rating of 4, rather than 5, stars offers my answer), who, besides me, Schickel, and our co-age group, is the book for? While his insights into all the films he cites are meticulous, the vast majority of them are not only obscure to most film goers, but DESERVEDLY so.<BR>The writing is, as one would expect, always compelling; the portrait of America, film, and the intertwining of the two to an impressionable public, is flawless. Indeed, the subject not only should have been covered, but needed to be. But, will the average film buff, let alone the average reader, be as enthralled as I was? Alas, I tend to doubt it, but I'm grateful it was done, anyway.	2003-05-31

But, every so often, he produces something that reads more like an exercise than a fully thought out work. MFN is such a book. One can't get over the feeling that he came up with an amusing premise for a tale and then decided to challenge himself to see how many roadblocks he could put in his own way to try to figure out a solution. This, by the way, is similar to a couple of \\"challenge\\" novels he wrote with Brian Garfield a couple of decades ago wherein each author wrote a chapter whose main goal was to get the protagonists into an impossible situation and leave the other one to figure out how to extricate them. As a literary exercise, it's a lot of fun. As a novel, it leaves the reader asking \\"What next?\\", not in anticipation, but exasperation. Westlake can no more write a bad novel than Peter O'Toole can give a bad performance. But this is not one for the pantheon... more like for the underpatheon.	2003-04-17

All too often the plays of the era were simple nonsense pieces that simply replaced coherency with non-sequitur. The truly fine absurdist pieces, those that both had something to say and said it with wit, humor, and point, were few and far between. Two of those plays, written by one of the unsung heroes of the genre, are contained in this slim volume. Rosen, probably best known for &quot;Ned &amp; Jack&quot; (another woefully under-rated, overlooked, piece)wrote these exercises in &quot;absurdity&quot; with all the fun, and not a little poignancy, that makes any play a great theatrical experience. If anything, they read at least as well as they play. Any serious student of the theatre should read them. Any ambitious theatre company worth its salt, should stage them.	2003-04-12

While the history and erudition contained within \\"DaVinci\\" cannot help but be fascinating (hence the 3-stars), the book itself is overlong... and for no good reason! Further, it is hampered by an annoying \\"tick\\" that, ultimately, becomes infuriating. Mr. Brown seems to feel that one builds suspense by NEVER revealing anything of importance to the plot without first taking page-upon-page of digression after we have been told that something important IS going to be revealed. While this can be effective when used sparingly, it truly becomes irritating when it is used constantly! One example, which occurs right at the beginning: We are told a murder victim has placed himself in an odd position before dying. We are told this two, three, four, times. Yet we have to go through page after page of description of the Louvre museum (where the body is) before we find out what the position is! And there is no reason for this (it's just the tip of the iceberg) except for Brown to show off his knowledge of history.<br />In short, while I'm sure many will find this tour of ancient culture fascinating (I did myself), as a thriller it fails.	2003-04-05

Westlake has always returned to two ongoing characters. Both are professional criminals, Dortmunder and Parker. As Westlake, his Dortmunder books are always hilarious. As Richard Stark, his Parker tales are always grim and filled with (cliche alert!) nail-biting suspense. What is amazing is that THEY ARE THE SAME BOOKS!!!

Since all of them pertained to the title story, it seems only fair to rate the book on that basis, even though the other stories vary from passable to, actually, quite enjoyable. But that first (title) story is, well, it's abysmal! The plot is inane! The dialogue resembles nothing spoken by living human beings anywhere on the planet! The prose is so many shades darker than purple that no sprectrometer could calculate it! And even the editing reflects all this.
