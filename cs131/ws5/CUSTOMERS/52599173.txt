Howard Bryant is a talented and tireless journalist.  His book, \\"Juicing the Game; Drugs, Power, and the Fight for the Soul of Major League Baseball,\\" is a fair and objective analysis of a complicated subject.  It is also the most comprehensive book to date about the sensitive subject of steroids and its enormous impact on our treasured national pastime.<br /><br />The author is also a teacher.  He reports important historical baseball information that is critical to understanding the complexities of the crisis today.  In particular, he properly dissects the semi-explosive variables that make for a tense relationship between the major league baseball owners and the powerful players union.  The owner/union behavior pattern is a key factor in understanding why steroids have been allowed to enter the game.<br /><br />Bryant demonstrates how players can enhance two elements critical to a hitter...speed & strength.  In other words...\\"the science lab has found its way into baseball,\\" according to the author.  The book carefully explains how creatine, androstenedione and anabolic steroids are eating at the game's core.  The presence of these drugs have baseball purists coast-to-coast livid that \\"cheaters\\" are destroying legendary home run records.<br /><br />Before 1995, just eleven baseball players in the history of the game reached the magic number of 50 home runs.  In 1996, Brady Anderson of the Baltimore Orioles hit 50, he had never hit more than 21 in a single season.  Moreover, the 1996 Orioles shattered the storied 1961 New York Yankees (Maris & Mantle) team home run record of 247.  Bryant explains that owners and players across the board raised eyebrows...but that as long as the ball clearing the fence brought back fans after the unpopular 1994 strike (that canceled the World Series for the first time)...little was done to correct the problem.<br /><br />Mark McGwire, Barry Bonds, Jason Giambi, Gary Sheffield, Sammy Sosa, Jose Canseco, and Ken Caminiti are all given the glare of Bryant's journalistic investigation...and it \\"ain't\\" pretty.  However it is the leadership of baseball...the owners that the author ultimately ends up pointing the finger of blame for putting profits ahead of the health of the institution.  This is a brilliant book that patiently explains how, \\"Popeye is spiking his spinach.\\"  Recommended.<br /><br />Bert Ruizurnalistic investigation...and it \\"ain't\\" pretty.

Author John Vaillant carefully explains how the Golden Spruce and Grant Hadwin...the immensely talented but deeply troubled frontiersman who cut it down...were both one in a billion.<br /><br />Vaillant is a majestic writer.  His historical description of Canada's Northwest Coastal forest in British Columbia is superb.  The author carefully details how the Northwest forests support more living tissue, by weight, than an other eco system, including the Equatorial jungle.  He also reports how the Queen Charlotte Islands were the historical territory of the Haida People, who call their home Haida Gwaii.  The Haida People knew the Golden Spruce was exceptional and called it \\"K'iid K'iyaas\\" for the Elder Spruce Tree.<br /><br />The woodcutter has been the point man for Western civilization.  Some loggers are good, considerate road builders.  Unfortunately, most loggers are extremely wasteful and rape the earth.  Grant Hadwin was a rugged woodcutter and intelligent road builder who detested the giant corporations that destroyed vast forests with little concern for fundamental environmental considerations.  Over time Hadwin leaves his wonderful family...becomes mentally unglued...and commits a great crime. Recommended.<br /><br />Bert Ruiz	2005-08-31

Three are in France and four are in Spain.  Consequently, the birth of local Basque wall graffiti, \\"four plus three equals one.\\"  \\"The Basque History of the World,\\" is a comprehensive historical portrait of a proud people.  Moreover, author Mark Kurlansky details the very unique and \\"tenacious\\" characteristics of the Basque population.  Interestingly enough, Kurlansky argues that the Basque tongue, \\"Euskera\\" is likely the oldest living European language.<br /><br />Kurlansky's narrative starts in the Bronze age, examines the bloody difficulties of the Spanish Civil War, it documents the stunning bravery of the Basque people during World War II, and reports the terrible human rights violations inflicted on the Basque people by the Franco Dictatorship.  Kurlansky also does not fail to report the impressive economic development of the region from fishing to shipbuilding to steel manufacturing.  On a diplomatic note, the author makes a point of reporting the shameful American State Department betrayal of the Basque people due to Cold War politics.  Finally, this book is an important source of information for all Latin Americans...you may very well discover your own links to the Basque culture.  Recommended.<br /><br />Bert Ruiz	2005-08-05

The production of salt powered empires.  Moreover, the salting of fish, fowl and hams fed soldiers and sailors for extended periods...allowing for the expansion of trade and military empires.<br /><br />The Roman Empire required salt for its soldiers and at times soldiers were paid in salt...which was the origin of the word \\"salary\\"...and the expression \\"worth his salt\\" or \\"earning his salt,\\" according to Kurlansky.  After the fall of Rome, Venice became the dominant commerical force in Europe.  To this end, salt trade maintained Venice's palatial public building and the complex hydralic system that prevented the metropolis from washing away.<br /><br />Soon farmers in France discovered that curdled milk drained and preserved in salt made many different types of cheese.  In Parma, Italy the production of salted \\"Prosciutto\\" ham and \\"Parmesan\\" cheese made the city famous.  The same thing happened with the production of salted \\"Salami\\" in Felino and Genoa, Italy.  However, a major factor in the prodcution of salted fish was the Medieval Roman Catholic Church's decision to forbide the eating of meat on religious days and the Lenten fast (40 days) and all Fridays.  This was serious business...under English law at the time the penalty for eating meat on Friday was hanging.  Consequently, trade in dried fish boomed...especially for Northern Cod, which had a white flesh with little fat (fat resists salt) and dried easily.<br /><br />Page after page of this book is filled with significant historical information on how salt impacted economies especially with sea vessels and river steamboats. The author also includes little tid-bits of information about the develpment of our language...particularly the origin of expressions.  For instance, when early American settlers hunted they would leave red herring along the trail because the strong smell would confuse wolves which is the origin of the expression \\"red herring,\\" meaning...\\"false trail.\\"  Finally, Kurlansky explains that \\"Generals from George Washington to Napoleon discovered without salt...war is a desperate situation...salt was needed to treat wounds, preserve food for soldiers and for the diet of the calvary's horses.\\"  Recommended.<br /><br />Bert Ruizmell would confuse wolves which is the origin of the expression \\"red herring,\\" meaning...\\"false trail.\\"  Finally, Kurlansky explains that \\"Generals from George Washington to Napoleon discovered without salt...war is a desperate situation...salt was needed to treat wounds, preserve food for soldiers and for the diet of the calvary's horses.\\"  Recommended.

This slim (44 pages) beautifully designed & laid out book includes 18 poems filled with words & thoughts that are meant to, \\"say little...and suggest much.\\"<br /><br />Delezen is too modest.  He should have included a short \\"Introduction,\\" to inform the reader of his love affair with the Vietnamese people, language & culture.  Moreover, I think readers would be delighted to know of his long dedication to understanding the written and oral history of Vietnam.  In many ways Delezen is a poet/scholar with a rare viewpoint and a gift for writing.<br /><br />My favorites include, \\"Night Storm,\\" followed by \\"Untitled,\\" and \\"Con Gai.\\"  I must also add that the very first page of this book...the dedication to Dickey Chapelle, \\"a beautiful moth that flew too close to truth\\"...admirably captures the heart and eye.

Harris is a stirring narrative of the tardiness, tantrums and turmoil that inflicted much pain on the Clinton family during the eight years they resided in Washington.<br /><br />There is no doubt President Clinton has a first-rate mind.  He arguably must rank as one of our nation's brightest President's.  However, Harris explains he is also a fox...and his constant zigzag/flip-flop decision making damaged his presidency.  Nevertheless, his economic strategy brought enormous prosperity to the nation and Harris points out that President Clinton must be praised for the implementation of this stoic fiscal policy.<br /><br />This is an objective book.  The title says it all.  President Clinton survived.  He will not go down in history as a great president.  His presidency will be forever tainted by scandal.  Harris does a credible job of presenting the facts and steering clear of moral judgments.  The author does an excellent accounting of the characteristics of the Clinton personality. Harris also powerfully demonstrates the intense complexities and hollow denials of the President. Recommended.<br /><br />Bert Ruiz	2005-06-23

(Scotty) Reston was the high priest of journalism in America before the dramatic growth of television.  Professionally, he was dedicated to the notion that the more you could find out...the better the health of the nation.  Reston primarily made his name in Washington DC, writing for the New York Times and for most of the 1950's and the 1960's he had unparalleled prestige across America.  He also had remarkable access to powerful decision makers around the world.<br /><br />Reston was a complex man.  He was protective, kind and fatherly to a slew of great reporters but was cold and distant to his three sons.  He was a dedicated husband...devoted to his wife Sally...but he was extremely insensitive to woman journalists who worked for him.  Finally, he was a nurturing bureau chief in Washington but a lousy executive editor in the New York headquarters of the Times.  Nevertheless, Reston was basically optimistic, moralistic, and a paean to the American ideal that the immigrant son of poor uneducated parents could succeed.<br /><br />Reston's great sin was being taken in by Henry Kissinger's selfish duplicity, according to author John Stacks. Reston was manipulated by Kissinger and eventually became a full-fledged insider. He stopped being a smart, analytical, objective reporter, Stacks reports. Others said that Reston stayed around too long (he kept writing into his early 70's)...that he \\"wound up being non-interesting and bland.\\"  Still and all, \\"Scotty\\" was a patron to R.W. \\"Johnny\\" Apple, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan, Charles Mohr and many other famous journalists.<br /><br />Bert Ruiz	2005-06-07

Coach Bob Hurley is an old fashioned basketball coach.  He does not massage egos...he does not compromise...he demands a strong dedication to excellence...and if you don't give it...you will be asked to turn in your uniform.  In other words...only hard work works.  \\"The Miracle of St. Anthony; A Season with Coach Bob Hurley and Basketball's Most Improbable Dynasty,\\" should be required reading for all AAU basketball coaches across the nation.<br /><br />Many AAU programs do not teach the fundamentals of basketball...they showcase...and use players as trophies.  Many AAU programs are also factories who spit out players regularly when other more talented players come along.  Coach Hurley teaches his kids how to play as a team and sticks with them for a lifetime.  He also introduces a culture of refreshing honesty and does not engage in the dark world of under the table payments to, \\"street agents.\\"<br /><br />Admittedly, Coach Hurley would not get away with the harsh screaming and cursing of players in most affluent suburban basketball communities.  However, it appears to be the right forumla in Jersey City an inner city low-income community just across the Hudson River in the shadows of New York City.  The kids who play for St. Anthony use basketball as an escape from the demons of drugs and violence on the streets. They use the academic and basketball education at St. Anthony's to get free rides to college.<br /><br />Coach Hurley shows them the path.  He does so by teaching them discipline...the discipline to keep your mouth shut and play ball.  It is amazing that Coach Hurley's teams rarely get called for technical fouls.  They play the game on the court and are prohibited to \\"trash talk\\" to opposing players, coaches or officials.<br /><br />But it is hardly a piece of cake...Coach Hurley is demanding.  He expects a \\"total,\\" commitment.  Some pages of this book are harsh.  However, this is a national high school powerhouse with a long tradition of championships and it is hard to argue with the genius of Coach Hurley.

To this end, \\"Botero: Donations to the Museo Nacional,\\" is Botero's heartfelt artistic documentation of the tragic tradition of violence in his native land...Colombia.<br /><br />Colombia is in the midst of a bloody 58-year civil war.  Well-armed guerrillas, paramilitary death squads, drug traffickers, kidnappers, sophisticated money forgers, emerald smugglers, common criminals and an armed forces with a long tradition of human rights violations have assaulted the sensibilities of the people of Colombia to the point that...death is a common companion.  Consequently, Botero took it upon his artistic shoulders to document the suffering of the people of Colombia.<br /><br />The result...a masterpiece.  Botero captures the bullets flying...the bloated dead bodies in the rivers..the march of death with coffins...the horrible violence to women in Colombia...the regular injustice...the people praying to be saved...the suffering of children...his intense artwork of Colombia's civil war communicates far better than television or cable broadcasters or journalists or non-fiction authors who try to report the overwhelming violence in Colombia.

On that note, \\"Welcome to Vietnam, Macho Man: Reflections of a Khe Sanh Vet,\\" is an extremely painful confessional of a Marine grunt lost in the darkness of death.  As much as Spencer boasts of his \\"Macho,\\" makeup...one thing is perfectly clear in the last 95 pages of this sleek compact book...Marines were totally trapped in Khe Sahn for 77-days with terrifying emotional consequences.<br /><br />\\"Skipper,\\" as his enlisted Marines call him writes an unsanitized account of his 1967-68 tour of duty in Vietnam as Commanding Officer of Delta Company, 1st Battalion, 26th Marine Regiment.  His language is no-nonsense Marine Corps vernacular.  Some of you will certainly consider it obscene...but do not let it scare you off...this book is filled with powerful descriptions of violence and pain...and in time...you will be numb to the profanity.<br /><br />Essentially, this book is about a stoic, brave, irreverent, combat Marine who is the supreme \\"Macho.\\" Ultimately however, the reader will discover that being \\"Macho,\\" is also about being afraid and testing the limits of raw human suffering.  Overall this book is essential reading for all interested in understanding the Marine warrior mentality during a dark period of the Vietnam War.

This book was made possible by a grant to the Orange County Historical Society from Walt Disney World and is co-published by the Orlando Sentinel. It was a wise investment...Central Florida's history is truly amazing.<br /><br />I took interest in the subject because I visit Central Florida frequently and wanted to check out its history.  To this end, this book is good, easy and fun reading and a great place to start if you want a comprehensive historical understanding of Central Florida.  The authors explain that the remants of the \\"true\\" natives (not killed by Europeans) were absorbed into offshoots of the Creek and Cherokee tribes who assumed the name \\"Seminoles.\\"  They also report that Oceola County is named for a legandary Seminole warrior and that Orlando is likely named after a soldier killed by Indians near Lake Eola in 1835.<br /><br />Robison and Andrews also inform us that Kissimmee's boom-town pioneer days were personified by swamp-empire builder Hamilton Disston whose land deal not only saved the State of Florida bankruptcy but turned a cow camp and trading post settlement into a steamboat and railroad hub of the 1880's.  Kissimmee was officially born on Election Day 1883 and it quickly earned a reputation as a town of saloons for ranchers and cowboys.  It also boasted the nation's first ride-up-saloon.<br /><br />However, the story of Central Florida cannot be told without including entertainment magnate Walt Disney.  Within five years after the 1955 opening of Disneyland in Anaheim, California executives began to think seriously about expanding East.  The story goes...\\"Disney and several of his top executives were flying in the corporate jet over Central Florida, scouting out potential locations when they located a vast stretch of virgin land near the junction of Interstate 4 and the Florida Turnpike...this is it!\\" they shouted.<br /><br />Disney wanted to stay away from the beaches where there would be too much competition for tourists' time and money.  He also wanted to avoid the mistake he had made at Disneyland: failing to control the land just outside the park's gates where garish development pushed right up to the property line and others made millions running hotels, restaurants and other tourist-related businesses.<br /><br />This book is an excellent source of information about the growth of Central Florida's citrus and cattle industry.  It also provides an outstanding historical accounting about the growth of Orlando, Winter Park, Kissimmee, Apopka, Maitland, Eatonville, Goldenrod, Pine Castle, Edgewood, Belle Isle, Windermere and many other Central Florida communities.

This is a true story...Perkins was a highly paid chief econonmist sent out to cheat countries around the globe out of billions of dollars.  The author comes face-to-face with the fact that he was a financial slaver...he inflated forecasts to enhance his firm's profitability and to saddle nations with debt.  Moreover, the system he promoted encouraged world leaders to become part of a vast network that promoted U.S. commercial interests.<br /><br />Perkins coins a term, \\"corporatocracy\\" which basically revolves around the concept that the rich get richer...and the poor get poorer.  He admits the system is based on corrupting public figures abroad and that it did not take kindly to public figures who refused to be corrupted.  He cites the cases of Ecuador President Jaime Roldos (who was killed in a helicopter crash on May 24, 1981) and Panama President Omar Torrijos (who was killed in a plane crash on July 31, 1981) as two leaders who stood for the right of their countries to determine their own destinies...and infers they became casualties of the \\"jackals\\" who enforced the system.<br /><br />Executives in the author's firm had a mentality that they, \\"milk the cow until the sun sets on our retirement.\\"  Perkins concludes that the system fostered a global empire of powerful American firms who where self-centered, self-serving, greedy and materialistic.  Ultimately, Perkins hated his life as a chief economist and loathed who he was.  Hence, he wrote this book to cleanse his soul.  On a balanced note, it is hard to swallow all of Perkin's \\"confessions.\\"  However, there is enough highly credible evidence to support the strongest allegations in this book.

Airborne silica in the mines turns lungs into wheeezing dust bags and corneas are regularly scratched by gritty dust belching through the gigantic ventilation fans. In many ways the Sunshine miners are the Marines of the underground.  They are strong, rugged and fearless.<br /><br />\\"The Deep Dark,\\" by Gregg Olson is the tragic story of Wall Street corporate owners who squeeze managers to improve quarterly results with a general disregard for safety.  Obviously there are accidents in all mines...the earth is unstable and men take chances.  However, Sunshine was one of the richest and deepest mines in the world...capable of producing for years.  And the rush for profits that created the May 1972 fire killed nearly 100 Idaho miners...making it the worst mine disaster of the century.<br /><br />The author does an impressive examination of the miner life.  He explores the region and defines why men (there are no women down under) are attracted to the dangerous life underground.  Certainly, the opportunity to make big bucks is a major attraction.  But Olson explaines how the thrill of hitting a vein pushed many men to force muscles pass normal limits.  Amazingly the fatal flaw of the fire is a polyurethane foam used to plug leaks that is highly flamable.  Ironically, the government urged mine owners and engineers to use it.  Another factor in the disaster is a management team that is afraid to shut down production of the mine for fear of retaliation from the corporate owners in New York.

To this end, \\"American Sphinx; The Character of Thomas Jefferson,\\" is a brilliant examination of a complicated individual.  Quite frankly, this is not a historical narrative...it is an upclose look at the many contradictions in the Thomas Jefferson personality.<br /><br />Readers who are looking for a full accounting of Thomas Jefferson's role in American history should look elsewhere.  This book unmasks Jefferson.  Ellis's chief quarry is Jefferson's character.  On that note the author documents the behavior of a great visionary and that of \\"a devious manipulator who played cowardly games with the truth.\\" More importantly Ellis honestly concludes that Jefferson \\"probably came to believe his own lies...he was not accustomed to having his word questioned and his excuses exposed, not even by himself.\\"<br /><br />Jefferson's paradoxical stance on slavery gets glaring attention.  Ellis reports a stunning Jefferson metamorphosis, \\"His most unattractive feature...his deep convictions that blacks were inherently inferior and could never live alongside whites in peace and harmony.\\"  This imperfection stains Jefferson's greatest achievements...the skilled draft of the Declaration of Independence and the timely Louisiana Purchase.  Still and all, Jefferson developed a keen sense of himself as a Founding Father with a prominent place in history books.  He left behind many of his edited letters and papers for history to judge.  He obviously hoped he could influence how history remembered him but he probably never imagined that people like Ellis (and select others) would dig this deep.

The introduction and translation by James Graham is outstanding. Graham displays a towering knowledge of Colombia and successfully argues that Plan Colombia will never succeed.  His logic is simple, \\"no military campaign will ever extinguish the narcotics trade, because it would first be necessary to eliminate the disenfranchised members of society, individual by individual.\\"<br /><br />The testimonial literature in this short (158 page) book reports how Colombians want a better life and roll the dice on getting caught trafficking.  Unfortunately, the author employs weak transitions which leads to a choppy read and much confusion.  The first (the mule driver) and last (puppet) chapters are good.  However, much of what is inbetween contains nuggets of interesting information but it is wrapped in a maze of confusing language.  The back of the book informs us that Alfredo Molano is a highly regarded sociologist and journalist who (in his native Colombia) is compared to Gabriel Garcia Marquez. That may be true...but he will hardly be confused with the legendary Gabo by critical readers in this country.<br /><br />Bert Ruiz	2005-03-24

To this end, the author provides an intimate understanding of \\"how\\" young urban and rural Colombians flock to revolutionary movements. However, this book has two major shortcomings.  First, the author fails to adequately explain \\"why\\" Colombians turn their back on establishment institutions to promote change.  And secondly, Vasquez makes a very feeble attempt to demonstrate contrition for living the life of a terrorist for 18 years.<br /><br />On that note, it is no surprise that the Spanish-language version of this book was awarded the Colombian National Prize for Testimonial Literature in 1998.  Colombian readers have a good understanding of the absence of political, economic, social and land reforms inside their country.  American readers of this text should be warned to pay close attention to the strong 22-page historical \\"Introduction\\" by Arthur Schmidt.  Otherwise, they will never completely figure out \\"why\\" Colombians join guerrilla organizations.  The author fails to give a comprehensive understanding of significant historical events.  For instance, Jorge Eliecer Gaitan, the Bogotazo, La Violencia, The National Front, the controversial 1970 elections and Camilo Torres take a back seat to her day to day anti-imperialism, anti-oligharchy, anti-sectarianism guerrilla activities.  Had the author dedicated more time to weave Colombia's complex history to her narrative this would be a benchmark book.<br /><br />Still and all, this is an extremely valuable text.  Vasquez is harassed, hunted and tortured by state institutions.  She also renounces motherhood twice for her senior leadership position in the M-19 guerrilla organization.  Consequently, her explanation of the turmoil on the Colombian urban campus and the era of war for the sake of peace is useful.  Moreover, information on legendary M-19 leaders, Jaime Bateman, Gustavo Arias (a.k.a. Boris), Carlos Pizarro, Ivan Marino Ospina, Antonio Navarro, and Alvaro Fayad is priceless.  It just would have made more sense for the author to have developed a better \\"connect\\" between the revolutionary consciousness and Colombia's long history of state-inspired violence.<br /><br />Bert Ruizaime Bateman, Gustavo Arias (a.k.a.

Like most of mainstream America I hold David Halberstam in high esteem but must confess that somehow, \\"The Next Century,\\" never hit my reading radar screen.  Consequently, I decided to check it out and must immediately report this slim (159 pages) book is an outright jewel.<br /><br />Moreover, reading this 1991 publication in 2005 allowed me the luxury of examining Halberstam's appealing narrative during the infant steps of the new century.  On that note, this book is primarily framed around the end of the Cold War and the excellence of the Japanese economic model.  The author also makes a very strong point of declaring early on that the end of the Cold War provided the White House with a gigantic \\"Peace Dividend\\" opportunity.  That because of the end of the Cold War the White House was finally fully capable of spending billions of dollars on domestic needs.<br /><br />Halberstam used J. Robert Oppenheimer's vivid description of the Cold War, \\"two scorpions in a jar, each able to give a nuclear sting to the other, but only at the price of its own death,\\" to quantify the struggle between the world's two super powers.  He also made a point of bashing Henry Kissinger's February 1989 \\"last speech of the old order\\" that the United States should be wary of the Gorbachev Revolution in the Soviet Union and that \\"if there was any weakness to American policy...it was American naivete.\\"<br /><br />A Halberstam book with comments about Vietnam is always a bonus. Therefore I thought it was interesting how Halberstam warned of the supreme arrogance and trickery bookkeeping of the Johnson Administration that allowed the White House to deliberately lie to the people about Vietnam.  He also stated that \\"empires are run by men who are not suited to telling the truth, they valued power over truth and they created their own truth.\\"  It was almost as if this astute observer of the Vietnam War could look into the future and advise us not to be duped by White House fiction of \\"weapons of mass destruction.\\" Without a doubt...I wholeheardedly agree with this legendary American sage when he observes that...history punishes those who come late to it.

However, Robert Hanssen (FBI) \\"was much more important (to the KGB) because he allowed the KGB to penetrate U.S. intelligence to such a degree that the KGB came to regard him as the greatest asset, surpassing Aldrich Ames,\\" according to the author.  Ironically, both Americans were \\"walk-ins,\\" and were never actively recruited to betray the United States.<br /><br />\\"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer,\\" by Victor Cherkashin is an outstanding narrative of how former CIA agent Ames and how former FBI agent Hanssen gave the KGB the \\"mother lode\\" of information on the United States intelligence efforts against the former Soviet Union.  To America, Ames and Hanssen were monsters...but the author demonstrates how in the eyes of the KGB both men were heroes. Interestingly enough, Ames declares he cooperated with the KGB because, \\"he worked for an agency that deliberately overestimated Soviet Union capabilities to wrangle more money for its own operations.\\"  Hanssen basically cooperated with the KGB because he loved the danger of it and truly thought he was much too smart to get caught.<br /><br />This book covers much territory.  The author reports the unmasking of Soviet spies Ronald Pelton, the NSA cryptologist, former Navy sailor John Walker, and Edward Lee Howard.  Cherkashin makes mention of Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard but only in his description of 1985 as the \\"year of the spy.\\"  In conclusion, the author does an excellent job of describing how a series of lucky breaks dramatically altered the landscape of U.S. - Soviet espionage.  He also does a professional job of explaining the Soviet spy strategy of observation, orientation, decision and action. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Bert Ruiz	2005-03-17

Her professional credentials are impeccable, her nerves are made of steel and she has a soul capable of feeling the pain of the less fortunate.  On that note, \\"Naked in Baghdad: The Iraq War as Seen by NPR's Correspondent Anne Garrels,\\" is a rare documentation of the voices of the people condemned to war.  The book is also a window into how the few American journalists who actually stayed in Baghdad during the U.S. invasion practiced their trade.<br /><br />Early on, Garrels reports that Iraq is like covering the former Soviet Union where she began her career in the late 1970's because reporters had to live under the close supervision of security services.  Moreover, she observes that the people of Iraq are mired in isolation and poverty and there is a growing bitterness that the world has rejected them.  Key to understanding conditions on the ground is the constant reminder by the people of Iraq indicating that they feel they are an ungovernable mixture of peoples who need a strong leader to remain a strong united country.<br /><br />Garrels is certainly not a mouthpiece for American interests.  She reports the \\"blind fatalism,\\" of the people of Iraq...and it ain't pretty.  For instance...those who hate Saddam, still despise us and...anger for the U.S. invasion is far greater than anything they felt for Saddam.  Additionally...Iraqis want to know why President Bush is not targeting North Korea...and they conclude that the answer is...OIL.  And also...Garrels reports that there is sizzling resentment of American arrogance.<br /><br />In the words of the author, \\"I was there to see how Iraqis see themselves, their government and the world around them.\\"  Consequently, she does not fail to report the most of the Iraq people knew the country would dissolve into ethnic and religious conflict if the U.S. started a war.  Garrels also reports the anger at Israel and the concern at how the Palestinians people suffer unjustly.  Finally Garrels reports how President Bush insisted in a December 5, 2002 statement that Iraq had, \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" and how the people of Iraq reacted to the absence of proof.

Hersh is a tier-one journalistic examination of the Bush/Chaney/Rumsfeld post 9/11 brass knuckled quest for information.  In essence, Hersh documents how the White House is fighting terror with terror.  Moreover, the author directs a glaring spotlight on the White House eye for an eye retribution that prompted the authorization of \\"Black Programs,\\" with an above the law, \\"grab who you want...do what you want,\\" operational doctrine.<br /><br />Hersh gives a blow by blow account of Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld's impatience with military protocol and details his  public disdain for the internationally accepted rules of the Geneva Convention.  He also reports that the Secretary of Defense wanted the civilian leadership of the Pentagon...not the CIA to lead the fight on terrorism.  Consequently, Hersh expertly exposes how the subsequent \\"sadistic, blatant and wanton criminal abuses,\\" at Abu Ghraib prison took place.  It also documents the wrongdoing in the main interrogation center in Afghanistan and at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.<br /><br />The heavy-handed approach in Guantanamo which was based on coercion instead of persuasion was considered evil and stupid by senior Pentagon terror experts.  Human Rights Watch reported that President Bush was, \\"dead wrong in proclaiming that international law did not apply to detainees at Guantanamo.\\"  Additionally, senior JAG lawyers in the Judge-Advocat General's Corps protested the \\"extraordinary means\\" used on prisoners.  This book paves the way to understanding how the White House created conditions that allowed transgressions to take place all over the world.  Recommended.<br /><br />Bert Ruiz	2005-03-03

The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan on December 27, 1979 and pulled out on February 15, 1989.  All and all, 28,000 Soviet soldiers were killed in Afghanistan. Crile brilliantly documents how Charlie Wilson is the man that made it happen.<br /><br />Charles \\"Nesbitt\\" Wilson is a 1956 graduate of Annapolis who worshipped Winston Churchill and entered politics in 1961 at the age of 27 as Texas State Representative.  Wilson won a seat to Congress in 1973 as a Liberal. He regularly voted against Vietnam and eventually became of strong defender of Israel.  Wilson's appointment to the House Appropriations Committee and a strategic alliance with an irreverent street-wise CIA veteran named Gust Avrakotos ignited the biggest covert action since the Vietnam War.  It wasn't easy...Wilson took on the CIA's regional masters and won.  He did so by dramatically increasing CIA funding for the Afghan fighters.  His primary mission was to find a weapon that could knock the powerful Russian Mi-24 Hind Helicopter gun ship out of the sky.<br /><br />The author is knowledgeable.  He reports the towering importance of revenge in Afghan society.  He also details the cruel and disturbing side of the Afghan tribal warriors.  To this end, Crile shows how the Afghans were seen as freedom fighters before 9/11 and as terrorists afterward.  Moreover, Crile explains how the Afghans grew confident with the defeat of a superpower. Ultimately, this book is a strong account of how the CIA funded the war against Moscow's army and how the defeat at the hands of the Afghans contributed to the demise of the Soviet Union.  In conclusion, Crile must be commended for documenting a key piece of CIA history for \\"Main Street\\" America. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Bert Ruizy recommended.    Bert Ruiz	2005-03-01

To this end, the author has firmly established himself as one of the \\"best & brightest\\" financial journalists in the nation today.  Moreover, \\"Blood on the Street,\\" is a sure bet to command strong attention for several big-time book awards.<br /><br />On that note, Gasparino is a tireless investigator.  His fascinating narrative tells the story of how Wall Street's most powerful investment banking groups (and senior management) often tailored \\"New Economy,\\" dot com and telecommunication research to win deals that generated hundreds of millions of dollars in fees.<br /><br />The sad thing about the unsavory/criminal practice is that hundreds of thousands of small investors suffered massive losses because they considered the research honest.  However, the frightening aspect of Gasparino's reporting is that the Federal watchdogs at the Security Exchange Commission did little to protect small investors across the nation.<br /><br />Gasparino's portrayal of the cast is superb.  Jack Grubman, the top telecommunications analyst at Salomon Smith Barney and one of the highest paid executives on Wall Street is arrogant, mean-spirited, shallow and not particularly good looking.  Henry Blodget, the Merrill Lynch golden boy from Yale (affectionately known as \\"King Henry,\\" before the dot com bubble bursts) is a talented communicator but way out of his league when it comes to the earnest work of crunching numbers.  And Mary Meeker called the \\"Queen of the Net,\\" by Barron's is \\"petite, Midwestern, and famously hardworking\\" according to Gasparino.  Meeker is the best of the lot (by far) but still succumbs to the pressure from investment bankers and becomes a \\"cheerleader\\" for big fee clients.<br /><br />The primary hero of this sensational story is New York State attorney general Eliot Spitzer. He takes on the giant financial institutions and particularly humiliates Sandy Weill, the Citigroup CEO who without a doubt is the most powerful player on Wall Street.  Unfortunately, there is no happy ending.

President Richard Nixon was equally fearful of Daniel Ellsberg because the highly regarded government insider had copied 7,000 pages of Top Secret documents about U.S. involvement in Vietnam and released it to the New York Times for publication.<br /><br />Ellsberg, a former U.S. Marine infantry officer, Vietnam expert and dedicated cold-war warrior witnessed how the war was eating our young and decided to expose dark White House policy. On that note, \\"Secrets; A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers,\\" is a startling exposure of how the White House often conducted destructive policy behind closed doors and lied to Congress and the American public about it.  The author aptly summed up the situation he found when he finished researching years of Top Secret historical reports on Vietnam...\\"you don't have to be an ichthyologist to know when a fish stinks.\\"<br /><br />Ellsberg discloses (among many other things) that in March of 1969 William Beecher of the New York Times reported the Top Secret bombing of Cambodia.  Beecher's story had been particularly embarrassing to Nixon and Kissinger because it revealed details on the operation that the White House had meant to keep from Secretary of Defense Mel Laird and Secretary of State William Rogers.  Ellsberg also demonstrates how Nixon and Kissinger orchestrated a strong government denial that forced the quiet death of Beecher's New York Times report.<br /><br />The author concludes that, \\"it appeared that only if power were brought to bear on the executive from outside,\\" would the situation change.  He realized just like many other Americans that the Vietnam War was a endless, hopeless bloody stalemate.  Ellsberg also understood that we were supporting a corrupt South Vietnam government that primarily wanted to enrich themselves and who consistently ignored the needs of its suffering population.<br /><br />As background...I myself am a former cold-war warrior, having spent two tours in Vietnam with an elite USMC intelligence unit.  Moreover, I am well aware of the legendary work of USMC Lt.

A total of 2,209 residents perished when the South Fork Fishing & Hunting Club dam broke.  To this end, author David McCullough documents the incredible story in meticulous (and objective) detail.  In doing so...he also provides a heartbreaking account of what went wrong.<br /><br />The South Fork Fishing & Hunting Club was an elite organization of the super rich and powerful.  Members included, Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Philander Knox and Robert Pitcairn.  McCullough concludes that the club tampered drastically with the natural order of things and had done so badly.  Moreover, the club ravaged much of the mountain country's protective timber, which caused dangerous flash runoff following mountain storms; they obstructed and diminished the capacity of the rivers; and they bungled the repair and maintenance of the dam.  \\"Perhaps worst of all they had failed...out of indifference mostly...to comprehend the possible consequences of what they were doing, and partiularly what those consequences might be should nature happen to behave in anything but the normal fashion,\\" which according to McCullough was exactly what was to be expected of nature.<br /><br />The New York Times concluded that the cause of the flood was an engineering crime...that the dam was of inferior construction.  Other publications reported the nation simmered with deep seated resentment of the rich.  On a positive note, the help and aid to Johnstown was the greatest ourpouring of charity that the nation had ever seen.  Additionally, the doctors, nurses and sanitation crews did a \\"spectacular\\" job of preventing a typhoid epidemic.  And finally the author does not fail to report the countless others who went beyond the call of duty to perform tremendous acts of bravery. Unfortunately, the club members were never held accountable and were disgustingly \\"stingy\\" with disaster funding.

Ellis makes it very clear that if it were not for Washington...infant America would have died in its cradle.  In the eloquent and precise words of the author, \\"Washington launched the American ship of state and contributed his personal prestige as ballast on its maiden voyage.\\"<br /><br />On that note, Ellis documents Washington's early Virginia life, his lack of a formal education and his dangerous military service on the Indian frontier.  He also carefully explains how General Washington lost more battles than he won but intelligently realized that the two growing institutions of the emerging nation; the Continental Congress and the Continental Army...that the former be subordinate to the latter.  Moreover, Ellis details that at the ideological level, Washington instinctively understood the core principle of Republicanism...that all legitimate power derived from the consent of the public.<br /><br />The author goes to great lengths to explain Washington's natural integrity, \\"the exceptional character of George Washington...for refusing to regard himself as the indispensible steward of the American Revolution.\\"  According to Ellis, \\"No one entered the office of the President with more personal prestige than Washington, and only two...Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt...faced comparable crises.\\"  However, Ellis points out that Washington failed an important test by holding people in slavery in Mount Vernon.<br /><br />Still and all, \\"no one else in the founding generation could match Washington's revolutionary credentials and no one else could plausibly challenge his place atop the American version of Mount Olympus,\\" according to Ellis.  Overall I was particularly impressed with the research that documented Thomas Jefferson's character assasination and political betrayal of Washington and how Alexander Hamilton attempted to use Washington for his own political gain in the last years of his life.

Truman.  Moreover, McCullough carefully explains how the farmer from Grandview, Missouri...who never graduated from college, managed to become the thirty-third President of the United States of America.<br /><br />Truman was eulogized as the president who faced the momentous decision of whether to use the atomic bomb, he was praised for the creation of the United Nations, for the Truman Doctrine (to support free peoples), the Marshall Plan, the Berlin Airlift, the recognition of Israel, NATO; for committing American forces in Korea and for upholding the principle of civilian control over the military.  To this end, it must also be noted that Truman was the first president to recommend Medicare and that he had the courage to take a very strong stand on civil rights.<br /><br />Truman was a man who lived by simple small-town Missouri articles of faith that urged individuals to, \\"say what you mean, mean what you say...keep your word...never get too big for your britches and never forget a friend.\\"  McCullough observes that, \\"they were more than words-to-the-wise, they were bedrock, as clearly established, as integral to the way of life, it seemed, as were the very landmarks of the community...not everyone lived up to them, of course, but to Harry it seemed everyone ought to try.\\"<br /><br />McCullough packs this book with an enormous amount of historical and personal information.

And anyone who thinks this book is a partisan smear...I suggest they examine the meticulous notes, bibliography and acknowledgments put together by the author.  This 705 page book is stacked with highly credible research.<br /><br />On that note, Kelly presents Prescott Sheldon Bush and his wife Dorothy Walker Bush (George W.'s grandfather & grandmother) admirably.  The author reports that the senior Senator from Connecticut \\"laid down a marker of principle and tolerance,\\" and that he courageously voted to censure Senator Joe McCarthy at great political cost.  Moreover, Senator Bush \\"stood tall on civil rights\\" and lambasted backward southern leaders.  To her credit, Kelly presents Prescoot Sheldon Bush as a \\"progressive Republican.\\"<br /><br />To the contrary, Kelly does not treat George Herber Walker Bush and his wife Barbara Bush in a kind and gentle fashion.

Cameron and Philip Mauceri is a comprehensive and concise presentation of the Peruvian fundamentals.  Moreover, the foreword by Cynthia McClintock and Abraham Lowenthal sets the stage for a pragmatic understanding of the many historial challenges in Peru.<br /><br />The opening page of this valuable text explains, \\"Peru's problems began with the intensely traumatic Spanish conquest of the sophisticated Incan civilization...the problems continued with a humiliating defeat by Chile in the War of the Pacific during the late ninteenth century...and the problems were especially evident in the volatility of Peruvian politics during the twentieth century.\\"  To this end, since 1919...no Peruvian political regime...neither constitutional nor de facto...has endured for more than twelve years, according to the authors.<br /><br />Without a doubt, the regime of General Juan Velasco Alvarado (1968-75) was responsible for introducing the most radical social and economic changes in recent Peruvian history.  However, the sensational rise of Alberto Fujimori (a self-professed political outsider) from the ashes of the Peruvian party system and the \\"authoritarian style of rule\\" implemented by President Fujimori will naturally captivate the attention of many readers of this text.<br /><br />Still and all, the dismal experience with President Alan Garcia will also generate considerable attention. Nevertheless, this special collection of tier-one academic essays will clearly demonstrate that Peru has a unique three-party system with a very strong center and two extremist tendencies on the left and on the right.

This is without a doubt the most thrilling book I have reviewed about Colombia to date.  Moreover, I strongly recommend it to all readers who love action-packed...world famous...crime stories.<br /><br />In the words of Chepesiuk...the Cali Cartel would prove to be the most formidable adversary in the history of international drug trafficking.  The sophistication of this criminal organization is incredible...the strategy is both simple & brilliant...communications are state-of-the-art and street level members of the cartel are told to live modestly and to avoid drawing attention to themselves.  This is a hugh contrast to the rival Medellin Cartel that is both violent and audacious.  On that note, the author does a commendable job of interviewing all of the major Colombian and American political and law enforcement actors who played a role in the saga of the Cali Cartel and Medellin Cartel.  Chepesiuk's professionalism is impressive and also a tribute to his high standards of journalism.<br /><br />On the sad side, this book does document the enormous corruption of government officials in Colombia.  The Cali Cartel bought off senior members of government and of society.  Unfortunately, the practice continues...drug trafficker corruption still exists in the highest levels of the Colombian government & society today, according to the text.  Nevertheless, the Colombian National Police shines in this book with the arrival of its legendary leader...General Rosso Jose Serrano...who is dubbed, \\"Mr. Clean\\" by powerful members of the U.S. Congress.  In conclusion, if you have a long business trip to make and need to pack a good book...here it is.  This book is high-octane and impossible to put down.

On that note, Harvey F. Kline has published an excellent academic synopsis of 1983 Colombia.  Moreover, Kline deserves laurels for his outstanding study of social stratification and economic inequality in Colombia.<br /><br />The author explains that economic enequality is a salient characteristic of Colombian society...and that, \\"one does not need statistics to show it; it is enough to see adults picking food out of garbage cans as cars that cost US $50,000 are driven past them or to see shanties of tin and cardboard built beside luxury houses.\\"  Certainly, Colombia has improved dramatically since 1983...however, recent studies (World Bank & IMF) of income distribution today conclude that there is still a high level of inequality in Colombia.<br /><br />It is also refreshing to see that Kline does not sugar coat history.  He clearly reports \\"the rape of Panama,\\" from Colombia and how the U.S. government of Theodore Roosevelt encouraged a rebellion and prevented Colombian troops from traveling from Cartagena to Colon.  Nevertheless, this text primarily examines Colombia's complexities; regionalism, social class, politics, and economic models.  Kline concludes the Colombia is arguably one of the most complex countries in Latin America.  He bases this on the fact that Colombia is not a true liberal democracy, even though there are periodic elections and since 1974 there has been no electoral restraint...1970 was a major exception.

Moreover, the text includes dynamic fundamental statistics that adds an important dimension to understanding the complexities of Colombia's democracy.  An added bonus is a straightforward and compelling foreword by Jenny Pearce...a highly regarded author/journalist.<br /><br />To this end, Livingstone does not hesitate to inform the reader in the opening pages of this text that Colombia has the highest homicide rate in the Americas.  \\"More trade unionists, journalists and mayors are killed here than anywhere else...Most notoriously, it has the highest kidnapping rate in the world...  More than fifty thousand people have died in political violence since 1980 and the death rate is rising,\\" according to the author.  Livingstone goes on to explain that the armed forces and illegal paramilitaries are waging a brutal counterinsurgency war in the countryside.  She adds that the paramilitaries terrorize civilians in order to undercut support for leftwing guerrillas, who have been fighting the State since the 1960's.  To her credit, the author does not fail to objectively point out the recent human rights abuses by guerrillas.<br /><br />However, this book does more than document the human rights abuses inside the borders of Colombia.  Livingstone also provides a tier one study of the Colombian economy.  The examination of clientelism, income inequality and the coffee & oil sectors are outstanding.  A piece of the puzzle in understanding the economy is in the foreword where Jenny Pearce states, \\"Colombia's political & economic elite have failed to govern in the interest of all Colombians.  They have not constructed a state capable of building a nation which in turn would provide the cultural context for the political activation of ciizens and democratization of the state.\\"<br /><br />Livingstone goes one step further and adds that, \\"the harmony between politicians, technocrats, businessmen, newspaper editors, is due, by and large, to the fact that they all come from the same class, were born in the same parts of the country, went to the same universities and moved in the same circles or belonged to the same families.\\"  Obviously, the glaring absence of significant social and land reforms in Colombia is a direct result of the fact that the middle and lower class in Colombia has a tiny voice in promoting change.  Nevertheless, the keystone to understanding why Colombia is what it is today is clearly articulated by Livingstone in the chapter on Colombian history, \\"In Colombia, it would be accurate to say there were a variety of regional elites to whom local power was more important than the abstract concept of a nation.\\"  In completing this book one will likely conclude that Colombia will never find peace on earth until leaders in Bogota create authentic political inclusion and a fair administration of justice for all Colombians.

Moreover, Pierce was no less determined to be the first country to find a canal route on the Isthmus of Panama.  At the time, the traditional sailing from east to west was around Cape Horn, \\"one of the most storm-ravaged passages in seafaring,\\" and a four-month voyage to boot.  A Darien Canal would cut the tough trip to California in half.<br /><br />To this end, Todd Balf's \\"The Darkest Jungle: The True Story of the Darien Expedition and America's Ill-Fated Race to Connect the Seas,\\" is a stirring tale of the 27-member exploring group and its dashing leader, Lieutenant Isaac Strain.  The author (also an accomplished researcher) explains how the search across the Panama Isthmus was an old idea.  In 1503, Christopher Columbus, on his fourth and final voyage carefully combed the Panama coast for the isthums but grew disgusted and abandoned the search. In 1513, Vasco Nunez de Balboa was the first European to see the Pacific from a peak on the Darian but did not successfully negotiate a passage.<br /><br />Consequently, the January 19, 1854 U.S. Darien Exploring Expedition was an ambitious undertaking filled with great risk.  There was also trememdous economic considerations involved, with both the United Kingdom and France having declared intentions to march into the Darian with their own joint expedition in early 1854.  Fortunately, Lieutanent Strain's instincts were outstanding and the quality of the American survival skills were impressive.  Nevertheless, it was a painful and deadly race into the jungle.<br /><br />Strain's leadership was crucial...especially when the maps they went into the jungle with proved faulty.  As commander of the men Strain worked hard, used sensible planning and employed strong group dynamics to survive.  Ultimately, Strain, Frederick Avery (a New York City \\"Pioneer\\" hired in Cartegena), and seamen James Goldman and Henry Wilson were the advance party that barely averted death by starvation and disease to make it to the Pacific outlet on March 9, 1854.<br /><br />Patriotism played a large role in surviving.  Afterwards, the men stated they looked upon the service as perhaps the most important that they ever rendered to the country.  Although there were some critics the expedition primarily returned home as heroes having proved conclusively that \\"no open doors to the seas,\\" existed in the Isthmus. This book is well-written and a great read.

To this end, the author/missionary writes in an upbeat fashion and this short compact text is easy reading for anyone who wants first hand information on the challenges of missionary life in Roman Catholic dominated Colombia.<br /><br />Corley underwent back surgery, contracted malaria, typhoid fever, dengue fever, had numerous bouts with intestinal parasites and suffered 15 burglaries while serving in Colombia.  Moreover, the majority of Colombia's Roman Catholics were not initially thrilled with his work and he was subjected to many icy receptions.  However, it broke his heart to leave.  It broke his heart because he and his family were able to overcome the many hardships and managed to use their strong Christian love to establish four churches and several missions inside the borders of Colombia.<br /><br />Corley is a truly special human being.  He grew up very poor in Alabama.  But overcame his poverty to reach great heights. Corley also has a great sense of humor and uses it to share many of his hair-raising experiences in Colombia.  Clearly this is a book about faith...but Corley weaves his love of God into nearly every page of this book in a highly entertaining and yet very humble fashion.  This is a serious book that provides excellent insights to what makes missionaries tick.

The author is an explorer, historian and filmmaker.  However, since the Inca civilization left no written records...Thomson constructed his understanding of the Inca piece by piece...step by step and day by day.  Consequently he is now arguably one of the world's foremost experts on Peru's early society.<br /><br />The author is modest.  He acknowledges that luck played a large role in his successful find of Llactapata. First discovered by the legendary explorer Henry Bingham in 1911...(but he was never able to find it again.)  Hence it was lost for over a half century until the remarkable discovery by the young tenderfoot from England.  Moreover, Thomson playfully admits in the early portion of the text that luck was evident throughout his humble early beginnings in Peru.<br /><br />The author took twenty years to write this book and provides a seasoned eye to help the reader understand why the Inca build where they did.  I was particularly impressed with the meticulous research from beginning to end of this book.  To this end, the text has a scholarly quality to it but Thomson's irreverant writting style keeps the narrative lively.  Overall,  Thomson brilliantly manages to document the Inca people's dramatic civilization and the terrible annihilation of the vast empire by the 16th century Spanish Conquistadors.

Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, Dominic DiMaggio and Johnny Pesky played baseball for the Boston Red Sox during the 1940's and formed binding relationships that lasted decades.<br /><br /> This book is a must read for all Ted Williams and die-hard Red Sox fans. Halberstam is careful to portray the great &quot;Ted Williams&quot; as a true baseball legend but also a man with flaws. Moreover, the author does a magnificent job of detailing the Red Sox rivalry with the New York Yankees and Boston's frustrating pursuit of a World Series Championship during this era.<br /><br /> Halberstam uncovers real gems of baseball information. For instance, in 1941, the year Ted Williams hit .406, Bobby Doerr noticed that Williams had made a slight adaptation in his swing because he had chipped a bone in his right ankle during spring training. &quot;Every day Williams would have it wrapped, and he favored the ankle thoughout the season. Because of that, Bobby believed that Williams as a left-handed hitter was favoring his right or front foot and staying back a little more when he swung and so he hit an inordinate number of sinking line drives just past the second baseman into right field,&quot; the author reports.<br /><br /> Williams of course is the last Major League Baseball player to hit .400 or better in a single season. To this end, the author repeats some special baseball folklore...that on the last day of the infamous 1941 season Boston faced the Philadelphia Athletics in a doubleheader and, &quot;Ted's average rounded out to .400 and manager Joe Cronin had offered him the day off. But Ted Williams did not round things out, and he had played, gotten six hits, and taken the average up to .406,&quot; the author reports. Halberstam comments that few modern day ball players would have had the pride and work ethic to risk it all and do the same thing. Williams had a good day...but if he had gone hitless in six at bats...he would have failed to hit above the difficult .400 benchmark, Halberstam makes a point of reminding the readers.<br /><br /> I think what truly makes this book special is the fact that Doerr, DiMaggio and Pesky were profoundly decent human beings. Unlike Williams who had three marriages and a rocky relationship with his kids, his &quot;teammates&quot; had solid marriages and wholesome lives. Nevertheless, the four men formed a unique friendship that is both hearthwarming and a tribute to their generation of baseball players.

The mountains gradually rise from the Caribbean beaches and burning desert at the base to eternal snows at the top. It is the land of the Kogi...the special Indian people who consider themselves the Elder Brothers of humanity.<br /><br /> From the start, author/film maker Alan Ereira did not want to make a film about the Kogi...he wanted to make a film with them. His willingness to allow the Kogi to tell their story rather than dictate to them...lead the Elder Brothers to break centuries of suspicion and secrecy. This wonderful book is about how Ereira managed to make his documentary film. The author is careful to explain that the Kogi Elder Brothers offer us a way of understanding our own past. The Elder Brothers believe that they are the guardians to life on earth. The Kogi are not a violent people but like all indigenous people of America who were hospitable...they have learned that hospitality is the most dangerous virtue on earth. Hence, now that they have given Ereira the message...they want to be left alone again.<br /><br /> The Kogi have a powerful message...true &quot;words of wisdom&quot; that can help mankind. The Elder Brothers look on us as children, dangerous, irrational and essentially helpless. They call us, the &quot;Younger Brothers.&quot; They also see as moral idiots, greedy beyond all understanding. Over and over Ereira informs us that the Kogi speak of us sacking, looting the planet, tearing at is flesh without respect. If we fail to respond...the Elder Brothers say all life will be destroyed.<br /><br /> This book will certainly shake your soul. The Kogi are intelligent but an understanding of their world requires profound understanding and deep thought, according to the author. The Kogi are balanced...in harmony with mother nature and hope that we will listen to them and change our ways. They know that the &quot;Younger Brother&quot; has a butterfly mind which has paid no attention to mother nature's teaching. At the beginning the Kogi had a garden of Eden...but it was all destroyed with the arrival of the brutal Spanish conquistadors who sought gold and killed all who did not obey.<br /><br /> In order to understand the significance of the Elder Brothers I must borrow the words of one scholar in this marvelous book who documents his comments in the &quot;Journal of Latin American Lore.&quot; The scholar states, &quot;I truly believe that the Kogi can greatly contribute to a better understanding and handling of some of our modern dilemmas and that we should consider ourselves fortunate to be contemporaries of a people who perhaps can teach us to achieve a measure of balance...My appeal is to humanists, to psychologists and philosophers, to historians and to the community of international planning experts who, I am afraid, are far removed from the Magna Mater of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta.&quot; Highly, highly recommended.<br /><br /> Bert Ruizre and hope that we will listen to them and change our ways.

Credit must also be given to Linda-Anne Rebhun, Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Yale University who contributed an expert review of the manuscript. Markham touches all the bases in this small compact (64 pages) book. She explains the geography of the four Colombias; mountains, coast, plains and tropical rain forest. She details the two main Indan groups in Colombia; the Chibcha in the plateaus near Bogota and the Tairona on the Coast.<br /><br /> Markham also describes how Spanish explorers found Colombia in 1499 and how early Conquistador's sought riches and not the development of a nation. The Spanish controlled Colombia for three centuries until the first independance in July 20, 1810 and the final defeat of the Spanish by Simon Bolivar on August 7, 1819. Still and all, this book is much more than geography and history information.<br /><br /> The author does an outstanding job reporting intimate details of the people of Colombia, of the family life, festivals and food. She also researches education and recreation inside Colombia as well as provide brief biographical essays of the great Colombian artists; Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Fernando Botero, Jorge Isaacs, Jose Eustasio Rivera and Alejandro Obregon.

Moreover, over the years Brooks has explored the Appalachian Mountains from Quebec to Georgia and is the author of the highly regarded book, &quot;The Appalacians.&quot;<br />To this end, &quot;Life of the Mountains,&quot; is a well-written narrative that includes brilliant photos and drawings of nature's majestic mountain beauty and the living things that live there. This 1967 publication also has a very good graph that dramatically shows the differences in elevation between western and eastern mountains in North America. In addition, the author provides an appendix with a list of the finest national parks and monuments located in mountain country; a list of vanishing wildlife of the mountains; the basics of backpacking (with a list of hiking clubs across the country); and a guide to common fossils.<br />My favorite section is the narrative of Hawk Mountain in eastern Pennsylvania. Every autumn, bird watchers gather atop Hawk Mountain to witness the migration flights of hawks and other birds that pass the peak on their way south for winter. Professor Brooks provides records kept over many years that provide a timetable for migrations at Hawk Mountain. The Sep-Oct-Nov timetable is for a dozen differenct types of Hawks; the Osprey; the Turkey Vulture; the Bald and Golden Eagle; as well as for the Peregrine Falcon. The section on Yosemite Valley in California's Yosemite National Park is also special as is the section on the glacial crevasse on Mount Challenger in the Cascade Range. And before I forget...the section called, &quot;The spell of the mountains,&quot; is pure poetry for people who appreciate the splendor of mountains.<br />Still and all, Professor Brooks collected the finest minds in the nation to help him with this publication. Experts from Cornell University, the National Audubon Society, the National Park Service, the University of Georgia, Duke University, Yale University, the University of California, New York University and the California Academy of Sciences contributed to the excellence of this text. Overall, this is a great book for children, young adults and all lovers of mountain nature. You'll never tire of this book.

Dix is unquestionqably one of the world's foremost experts on Colombia.  To this end, Professor Dix (B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. from Harvard in 1951, 1953, and 1962, respectively) is highly regarded by students of Colombian politics in Europe, Canada, Asia and the United States.<br />Consequently, it will come to a surprise to many experienced Colombian readers to discover that the author is highly critical of Colombia's, &quot;Elitist&quot; Democracy.  In fact, Dix concludes that for many years Colombia became &quot;like a Aristocratic Republic,&quot; and that &quot;to call Colombia's politics democratic is to stretch the meaning of the word.&quot;<br />&quot;The Politics of Colombia,&quot; (a Hoover Institution 1987 Study) is clearly one of the finest American publications on Colombia and must be examined by all attempting to unlock the complexities of Colombian politics.  &quot;Colombia has historically been, and remains today, one of the most violent societies in the world in its internal politics,&quot; according to Dix.<br />The author attributes this to many factors, first and foremost to its heritage and, &quot;an important part of the heritage was the corporatist and patriarchal pattern of governance that pervaded Spanish imperial rule.&quot;  Moreover, Dix explains that Colombia was colonized by a mother country (Spain) that had experienced little of the Renaissance and none of the Reformation.<br />Another subject of great significance in understanding Colombia is the Church.  Professor Dix details how, &quot;The Roman Catholic Church has had a political and social importance beyond that of the Church in virtually any other country of the region, at times helping to make and unmake presidents, influencing elections (as well as more violent forms of political combat), and generally having a profound impact on the political socialization of Colombians.&quot;  In my opinion, Dix has gone where few other historians have dared.<br />Colombia's &quot;Intellectual Lion's&quot; are dismissed by Dix for allowing &quot;Continuismo&quot;...(corrupt practices) and for not challenging the undemocratic party politics in Bogota.  Ultimately, the study of Colombia in this text asks many probing questions...and correctly points a finger at the elite families who dominated the rule of government in Colombia and who commonly resorted to violence to keep power.  In conclusion, it is obvious from the meticulous work of Professor Dix that the first terrorists in Colombia were agents of the Elite State.

First and foremost it explains the incredible genius of Gabriel Garcia Marquez the writer. Moreover, it also provides a probing insight to the bloody political violence inside the Republic of Colombia.  \\"Living to Tell the Tale,\\" is a great read for lovers of literature but also objectively gives students of Colombian political history an eye-witness account of a government that was savage with its people.<br /><br />In the words of Gabito...\\"I was brought up in the lawless space of the Caribbean,\\"...the Nobel laureate explains with pride the difference between \\"Costenos\\" (Colombians raised on the coast) and \\"Cachacos\\" (Colombians raised in Bogota).  In some ways...it is comparable to the difference between very laid-back, open minded Californians and super-serious, ambitious New Yorkers.  However, the essential point the author makes is the cultural mind-set he was raised with.  A mind-set filled with surreal coastal dreams and the reality of the 1928 banana workers massacre in Cienaga which his loving Mother explained to him, \\"that's where the world ended.\\"<br /><br />Gabito was born on March 6, 1927.  He was heavily influenced by the sensitivities of his Mother and grandfather, Colonel Nicolas Ricardo Marques Mejia (called Papalelo by his grandchildren).  The Colonel was a veteran of the Liberal/Conservative War of One Thousand Days (1899-1903).  Consequently, the author learned from an early age that Colombia was a nation of many civil wars and that political differences inside the borders of his nation often ended in violence.<br /><br />Papaledo taught his devoted grandson that General Simon Bolivar (the George Washington of South America) \\"was the greatest man born in the history of the world.\\"  But Gabito is quick to inform the reader that he grew up with a formal education at the splendid Liceo Nacional de Zipaquira and grew up \\"bloodthirsty for Faulkner.\\" He adds that he started smoking heavily at 15 (he eventually quits) and strongly appreciated the genius of \\"Ulysses\\" by James Joyce and \\"Metamorphosis\\" by Franz Kafka.  Interestingly enough the author credits journalism for his sharp \\"reporter's eye\\" and states, \\"the novel and journalism are children of the same mother.\\"<br /><br />Still and all, the author is responsible and does not ignore the widespread \\"scorched earth policy of the government.\\"  In one of the most fascinating segments of this book he provides an eye-witness account of the April 9, 1948 murder of the beloved Colombian populist Jorge Eliecer Gaitan and vividly decribes the subsequent \\"Bogotazo\\" the greatest riot in the history of the Western Hemisphere.  He also offers his own credible conspiracy theory that there was a well dressed man who incited the crowd after the murder of Gaitan and \\"the man managed to have a false assassin killed in order to protect the identity of the real one.\\"  Gabito also goes to extremes to document the heavy handed government censorship of the press afterwards.<br /><br />Ultimately, the author tells us, \\"life itself taught me that one of the most useful secrets for writing is to learn to read the hieroglyphs of reality without knocking or asking anything.\\"  This is a true masterpiece and deserves to be read by all lovers of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and of the Republic of Colombia.

Carriker is a lovely story about a remarkable naturalist and a daring coffee pioneer in the beautiful Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain region of Colombia.  To this end, the story is told from an interesting perspective...because the naturalist is the author's father and the daring coffee pioneer is the author's grandfather.<br />Melbourne (Mel) Armstrong Carriker, Jr. is the world famous naturalist who between 1902 and 1962 collected some 80,000 birds and mammals (mostly birds).  Moreover, Mel described more genera and species (approximately 919) of Mallophaga than any other entomologist to date.  His work is celebrated at the Smithsonian, the Carnegie Museum, the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences and the Chicago Field Museum.  However, it must be noted that bird lovers will be frustated with the author because he rarely takes the time to name any of the thousands of specimens found in Colombia.<br />Orlando Lincoln Flye, born on a farm in Winslow, central southern Maine in 1861 is the coffee pioneer.  The Flye's had been in America early on...Orlando's maternal great-great-grandfather, Josiah Hayden, Sr., was a colonel in the American Revolutionary War.  A dedicated student, Orlando received an outstanding  education in electrical engineering...took the important position of general electrician with the Proctor and Gamble Company in Cincinnati, Ohio...and in 1890 accepted an invitation from the Colombian Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company in Barranquilla, Colombia.<br />Eventually, Orlando tired of the booming telephone business in Colombia and with his substantial savings turned to the romantic business of coffee-growing.  However, it was not easy...Orlando suffered a number of setbacks and after years of costly trials learned that coffee plants required a milder, cooler, more moist climate at a higher altitude to prosper.  Finally, in 1898 Orlando carves Hacienda Cincinnati out of the San Lorenzo range connected to Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains.  He works hard...becomes a success...and eventually formed the Cincinnati Coffee Company...then the powerful Santa Marta Coffee Company and in 1927 became a founding member of the Federacion Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia.<br />This is a good book.  Although the author is guilty of &quot;purple prose&quot; from time to time.  The author also turns a blind eye to the labor problems of the infamous United Fruit Company, perhaps because his two sisters married company men?  Still and all this is a great book for a vivid insight to early Colombia.<br />Bert Ruizected to Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains.

Drez is meticulously-researched, superbly written, features 116 brilliant black-and-white photographs and includes two great hour long audio CD's.<br />The authors use veteran accounts of D-Day from the vast collection of the Eisenhower Center for American Studies at the University of New Orleans. Brinkley and Drez skillfully place the accounts in twelve neat chapters that fully captures the military and logistic challenge of the Allies.<br />In essence, General Dwight Eisenhower, Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, executed the first successful cross-channel attack since William the Conqueror pulled it off in 1066. It was a gigantic task.  To this end, the authors put the puzzel together piece by piece and allow the first hand accounts of courage and carnage to explain how it was done.<br />Still and all, luck played a large role in the success of the Allies.  Nazi meteorologists forecast a period of disturbed weather that prompted General Erwin Rommell (Germany's best general) to leave France and proceed with a June 5 trip to see Adolf Hitler...German intelligence was convinced that the First United States Army Group positioned at Dover and commanded by General George Patton (America's best general) was poised to attack Pas-de-Calasis not Normandy...there was no German air or naval patrols during the first five days of June due to bad weather; the very weather the massive allied fleet moved through undetected...moreover what was left of the German radar system failed to pick up either the air train or the sea armada...and finally the first German reports from France of the attack on Normandy were ignored by top brass in Germany.<br />However, the two greatest features of this book is to point out that there was no Allied back up plan...that surprise was the key to success.  And secondly, that the German Army possessed the forces capable of inflicting a last-minute defeat on the Allies...that there were massive armored divisions within three days travel to the Normandy battlefield.  And that there were over sixteen hundred panzers in the west that could have been sent speeding to the battle area if Hitler issued the order.<br />It is incredible to think that if these forces had been brought into the battle area and dispersed in France before the British and American forces could build up...that the Germans were fully capable of delivering a devastating blow on the flanks and seams of the loose-knit Allied front.  This book is a tribute to the men and women who contributed to the D-Day victory.

Moreover, the author must be commended for starting this book when his wife (who urged him to continue) was already fighting cancer.  A battle she eventually lost.  Weinberg brings a compelling focus to World War II that few historians can match (particularly with the German/Soviet Union confrontation)...I for one am grateful for his dedication.<br />I first read this book nearly ten years ago...and now realize just how great this man's vision extends.  Weinberg is truly a remarkable historian.  Highly recommended for those who want the truth about World War II.<br />Bert Ruiz	2004-06-06

In addition, I found the two theater (European/Asian) \\"Chronology\\" excellent and appreciated the strong study of the years between the two world wars.<br />The editors of this Time-Life Book show how Adolf Hitler's and Albert Speer's artful spectacles rekindled German pride.  The text objectively explains the march to war and how good managed to defeat evil.  This is a serious book with photos that scream at you...particularly the shots that show how humans were guinea pigs for gruesome medical and scientific experiments...most of which were of little value.<br />The statistics in this book are super impressive.  All and all, this text is a tier one production.  It is also a great educational resource for all middle school and high school students who need reliable information about World War II.  Rest at ease parents...this book does not glorify war...it honors those who fought to end it.  Highly recommended.<br />Bert Ruiz	2004-06-04

Moreover, Clancy's well-known hawkish convictions adds volume to Zinni's powerful charge that the Bush administration failed the American people.<br />The former United States Central Command Commander in Chief points many fingers...and backs it up with solid facts.  Zinni is a classic gentleman and officer and like many other Marines I know from Philadelphia...he tells it like it is.  To this end, Zinni has articulated the most powerful charges I have ever seen a retired Marine Corps officer use against an administration at war. Highly recommended.<br />Bert Ruiz	2004-05-25

Murillo.  Moreover, \\"the nature of Colombia's internal conflict has been completly distorted by the prism of drug-war politics,\\" he adds in the opening chapter.  To this end, the author provides hard-hitting facts to support his claim that United States aid to Colombia, \\"is very often used by the Colombian political and economic elite to promote its own agenda.\\"<br />Murillo does not stop there...he exposes Colombia's feeble legal system. \\"In Colombia, the Constitution and its laws are often ignored and rarely enforced, either because of a lack of bureaucratic capacity on the part of the state to do so, or because of an absence of political will on the part of the ruling elite to execute those laws that are designed to protect the public,\\" he reports.<br />The author has few kind words for President Alvaro Uribe.  Murillo attacks the politically motivated violence \\"by the state and its paramilitary apparatus.\\"  He also is critical of the corruption of the traditional political parties, run predominantly by elites...\\"who compete for the spoils that serve as an incentive for cycles of generalized corruption.\\"<br />The origins of the conflict, the myths behind Colombian democracy, the principal actors in today's conflict and the many views in the United States are studied in detail in this text.  The analysis of the paramilitaries in Colombia is brilliant...particularly in respect to the millions of displaced people and the terrible treatment of Afro-Colombians.<br />Still and all, the best part of this book is the call for change.  Murillo slams Alvaro Uribe's unconditional support for George W. Bush and worries that the impunity of the violent actors in Colombia will continue to fuel the civil war.  In conclusion, the author clearly states that a pure military solution is impossible and that only true democratic reforms can stop the violence.  Recommended.<br />Bert Ruiz	2004-05-22

However, in my opinion part one...which includes chapters on; basic principles, rules to win by; the balanced machine; and planning each trip downcourt can help teams that are 13-years old and under.<br />Parts two and three are outstanding but geared much more for coaches who have experienced players who have a strong knowledge of the game and who have developed advanced basketball skills.  Nevertheless, this is a valuable book for all AAU or high school coachs who want a frame by frame breakdown of the 2-1-2, 2-3, 1-2-2, 3-2 and 1-3-1 defensive zones. Coach Kresse is a very talented coach and provides solid instructions on how to teach great execution.<br />Kresse played for and coached with legendary New York basketball coaches Joe Lapchick and Lou Carnesecca at St. Johns University and also with the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association.  And although Coach Kresse has a rich basketball history he teaches many new generation techniques.  Overall, this book presents good ideas for a successful basketball program.

In my case, the trademark of most of our teams is usually to play tough defense.  To this end, our defensive pressure generates plentiful scoring opportunites.  However, as my teams climbed into the tougher AAU tounaments and faced nationally ranked clubs I found our style was lacking and we needed a vast improvement in our ability to execute a reliable zone offense.<br />Consequently, I found, &quot;Coaching Zone Offenses,&quot; by Bob Huggins is an excellent guide to help teams score against complex defenses.  Coach Huggins does a good job of providing zone offenses in all shapes and sizes.  The key of course...as Huggins points out is to immediately identify what type of zone defense you are facing and then to make the appropriate adjustments.<br />The Huggins &quot;quick hitters&quot; and &quot;penetration &amp; pitch&quot; plays are easy to teach and valuable tools for getting quality shots during offensive opportunities.  We found the low post &quot;kick-out to wing,&quot; play a reliable offensive set against good zone defenses.  Certainly, the overload and ball reversal plays that Huggins recommendes open scoring opportunites on offense as well.  Coach Huggins is also a master of stacks and offers sound ideas on how to consistently crash the boards on offense.<br />Overall, this is a great book for coaches looking to prepare youth players for serious AAU or high school basketball competition.  The narrative in this text is well written and the many diagrams are easy to understand.  Recommended for coaches looking for more offensive options.<br />Bert Ruiz	2004-05-16

Moreover, Coach Ellis includes good teaching drills to perfect the many presses in this text.  Chapter one defines the shape of the zone press.  Subsequent chapters detail procedures and ways to attack an offense with a &quot;full-court&quot; and &quot;half-court&quot; press.  In addition, the final chapter is dedicated to the super important process of knowing when and how to regroup into a zone after the pressure press.<br />I keep this book in my coaching bag and constantly take it out during those long breaks in AAU tournaments to review what we did right as a team and what we need to continue to work on.

Author Joseph J. Ellis offers intimate portraits of our nation's founding fathers and also a vivid view of the political rivals in our newborn Republic.  Ellis is a terrific writer.  History comes alive in this stirring narrative...the action starts in the opening pages with the most famous duel in American history and ends in the final chapter with a glowing review of the fued/friendship between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.<br />John Adams, Aaron Burr, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and George Washington are examined in great detail by Ellis.  Adams &quot;enlightened diplomacy&quot; negotiated a critical peace treaty with France.  Burr is an opportunist and manipulator who was never forgiven for killing Alexander Hamilton in a duel.  Franklin, (who is not given the same attention as others) is a scientific genius who uses the press to attack political enemies, particularly those who were advocates of slavery.<br />Hamilton restored public credit but also nurtured power for the commercial elite at the expense of the large landowners. Jefferson is the brilliant author of the Declaration of Independance. Madison's nickname in Congress is &quot;Big Knive&quot; for his ability to cut up opposition to legislation he sponsors. And Washington is the &quot;American Untouchable,&quot; a great horseman and pragmatic military man who is clearly not as well read as other leaders of his generation but becomes by far the greatest legend among the people.  The combined talents of the founding fathers provided the intellectual energy that allowed our nation to survive.<br />Ellis is a talented writer, impressive researcher and a towering patriot.

This book is inspirational and demonstrates how the women of El Agustino work hand and hand with the church to break the chains of poverty and to &quot;take control&quot; of the direction of their lives.<br />Powers patiently explores the oft-mentioned, &quot;llamada de Dios&quot; or &quot;call of God&quot; that the women of El Augustino report and he carefully defines.  The author also documents the dangers of promoting change in the barrios of Peru and how &quot;Sendero Luminoso&quot; or &quot;Shining Path&quot; killed Maria Elena Moyano...one of the extraordinary early leaders of &quot;La Federacion Popular de Mujeres&quot; or &quot;The Popular Federation of Women.&quot;  The assasination took place in Lima in February of 1992 and takes place in front of her children.  Over 300,000 people attended the funeral of Moyano.<br />This 2003 publication reviews the history of the women's movement, the present course and the path ahead.  This book also shows what emerges from hard work and faith.  And how women do not depend on the unreliable men in the barrios to provide for them.

All in all,I was truly impressed with Chapter Two, \\"Planning a Meaningful Practice,\\" where the authors describe in great detail how to build self-esteem, avoid injuries, build teamwork and teach the game properly.<br />Other important chapters include throwing & catching, hitting, pitching, catching, playing the infield, playing the outfield, managing and coaching a game and a very valuable section that reviews reminders for your gameday/practice clipboard.  This is a fun book.  It starts with the basics and advances to more comprehensive levels of the game.  Still and all, a strong feature of this book is the importance of sportsmanship and how every player and coach who puts on a uniform is an ambassador of the community.

On February 19, 1945 Doc stormed the beach of Iwo Jima with the U.S. Marines amphibious landing units. Shortly thereafter, Doc Bradley was frozen in time by &quot;The Photograph&quot; taken by John Rosenthal of the Associated Press.  &quot;The Photograph,&quot; of course is of the six gung ho men who raised the replacement flag on Mount Suribachi.<br />&quot;Flags of Our Fathers,&quot; is about the Marines bloody battle for Iwo Jima where uncommon valor was common.  This book is also about the six men who raised the flag...how only three survived the battle...and how the others survived after the war was won.  All in all, the American victory at Iwo Jima hastened the end of the war in the Pacific.  But the price was horrific.  American soldiers killed about 21,000 Japanese on Iwo Jima but suffered more than 26,000 casualties doing so.  Making it the only battle in the Pacific where the invaders suffered higher casualties than the defenders.<br />The author does extensive research and interviews.  To this end, this book captures the tremendous bravery of the young men who fought in the battle for Iwo Jima. In the process, the author discovers after his father's death that &quot;Doc&quot; was awarded the &quot;Navy Cross&quot; but modestly never mentioned it to his family.<br />The six flagraisers: Mike Strank, Marlon Block, Ira Hayes, Rene Gagnon, Jack Bradley and Franklin Sousley are given special attention.  Author James Bradley retraces the lives of his father and the other five flagraisers in great detail.  The result is a sensitive and fascinating narrative.  This is a special book that properly documents that the generation of men and women who united to win the war in the Pacific were indeed the best we have ever seen.  The author also graciously adds to the legendary glory of the U.S. Marine Corps.  Recommended.<br />Bert Ruiz	2004-04-07

Richard Clarke writes a detailed account of how President George W. Bush reacted to 9/11.  He also provides a glaring account of the mad White House rush to war in Iraq.  To say the least...the information in this well-written book is stunning.<br />As a two-tour Vietnam veteran, trained journalist, author and proud American I am saddened by Richard Clarke's revelations.  I desperately wanted to believe in President Bush.  However, the author is one of our nation's best and brightest terrorism professionals.  To this end, Clarke's book offers highly credible insights to a terrible period in American history.<br />Ultimately, one must decide who has the most credibility.  The author...or the President of the United States.  The nation now has the opportunity to voice its opinion in the upcoming elections.  Consequently, Richard Clarke has done the nation a great service...he has confirmed what others who left this government have said...that the Bush White House has its own secret agenda and will viciously attack anyone who disagrees.  Highly recommended.<br />Bert Ruiz	2004-03-26

Everyone is talking about it, everyone has read it or is reading it and practically everyone is urging others to read it.  On that note, any avid reader will naturally raise an eyebrow and question whether any book can possible be that good.  To this end, I must honestly report that Dan Brown's book is actually better than expected.<br />In a nutshell, this book is a thriller.  The reader will be entertained from beginning to end.  Brown has authored a masterpiece...it is polished...and has no weaknesses.  Consequently, I urge any business person who is taking a long trip and will spend many hours in airports and flying...to pick up this book.  I don't think its fair to share the plot with you.  I don't want to spoil the fun.  Of all the books I have reviewed for Amazon to date...&quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is by far the most entertaining.  Highly recommended.<br />Bert Ruiz	2004-03-25

To this end, &quot;101 Offensive Basketball Drills,&quot; by George Karl is an ideal book for AAU basketball coaches who are looking to maximize team skills.  This book is certain to assist new and veteran coaches alike with conditioning, ball-handling, screening, passing, shooting, rebounding and fast-break drills.<br />Moreover, the offensive drills are presented in easy to understand diagrams with concise implementation instructions. On the downside, this is a succinct drill book with very little coaching narrative.  Any coach looking for comprehensive strategy or fundamental basketball insights should go elsewhere...this book is primarily a blackboard practice resource.  Nevertheless, I found &quot;101 Offensive Basketball Drills,&quot; an excellent tool to liven up practices and introduce new ways to improve the education of players.

Author William Greider carefully reviews the historical nature of capitalism and offers sound advice on how to improve the integrity of the financial system in the United States.  To this end, Greider demonstrates how deceit and manipulation of information by financial firms has triggered a public outrage.  And he provides a convincing argument that unless the bottom line includes humanity in its bookkeeping...capitalism will eventually destroy society.<br />For the most part serious tier-one traders of equities, bonds, commodities and forex markets will ignore the contents of this book.  They are on the cutting edge of establishing value and have no technical or fundamental instrument to quantify humanity in the daily battle of market pricing.  However, senior management, bankers and administrators would be wise to examine this text.  They are in a position to promote change.  And only they can end the callous indifference and greed that dominates Wall Street.<br />Greider does his homework.  He introduces the thoughts of several social gospelers and philophers to punctuate many important points.  At the top of the list of culprits is how senior corporate executives have no true social responsibilities other than to make money for shareholders.  On the contrary, the heroes of nurturing solid corporate social values are union managed pension funds who advocate wholesome investments.<br />On a less than positive note...Greider's &quot;agitating inquiry&quot; tends to get a little carried away with his criticism of certain segments of the financial system.  For instance, his allegations of fuedalism and master/servants labor systems in today's capitalist society are weak and will be discounted by objective economists.  Nevertheless, this is an important book that explores how downsizing, restructuring and outsourcing reduce human dignity, equity and self-worth for many Americans.<br />Bert Ruizignity, equity and self-worth for many Americans. <br />Bert Ruiz	2004-03-18

Taussig does not borrow from the research of legendary historical graybeards like Vernon Lee Fluharty, Richard E. Sharpless, Orlando Fals Borda or German Archiniegas.  He does not use academic journals, newspapers or magazines to prove a point.  Instead he presents a lyrical diary of his extensive fieldwork.  In doing so, the author provides a raw and unnerving documentation of Colombia's long tradition of violence.<br />Taussig's work is easy reading for students of Colombian - American affairs and Latin American specialists.  However, this book will be a tough road for those unfamiliar with Colombia's culture of denial.  For instance, Taussig condemns the government.  His work is a glaring spotlight on the government's paramilitary utilization of  \\"limpieza\\" or \\"social cleansing\\" of the bottom dwellers of Colombian society (desechables or throwaways). The author does not rely on Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International or even the U.S. State Department's repeated annual reports on the government's feeble human rights record.  Taussig lives with the relatives and friends of victims and dumps eyewitness accounts on the reader instead.<br />The author laments how a handful of wealthy families underhandedly bought and then destroyed an enormously fertile valley for thousands of families...in order to establish the<br />Cali sugar industry and institutionalize poverty for the same families as cane workers.  He also reports how Colombia's Army & Police intelligence officials create \\"lists\\" of people that are handed to paramilitary leaders for execution.  Union leaders, teachers, priests and other defenders of the poor often make the lists.  Taussig does not defend the guerrillas...he knows they are not angels.  This book is more about how the poor are caught in a violent sandwich with no hope in sight.<br />This book discloses a simple fact of life in Colombia.  That the ruthless paramilitary death squads are a part of the State strategy...particularly today.  The leaders of the paramilitary death squads employ terror and this book is an honest chronicle of regular public assassinations in broad daylight.  Yes, it is indeed tragic, that in Colombia the Army will stand aside and allow poor unarmed civilians to get cut to pieces because powerful members of society think this is how you protect democracy.

To this end, \\"Forced Out,\\" is a sensitive diary of the hardships of elite soldiering and the trauma of inner city police work.  Bywater provides an impressive narrative of the demanding commando training that the legendary British Royal Marines undergo.  Moreover, the author explains his transition to the police and his career path to the Moss Side of Manchester, a vicious crime ridden assignment that triggers his post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) meltdown.<br />This is not a gung-ho journal.  Bywater enters the British Royal Marines under the tender age of 17.  He goes into great detail describing the day to day demands of the vigorous 30-week commando boot camp.  Make no mistake...British Royal Marines are tough and maintain the same proud tradition of American Navy Seals, Army Green Beret and Marine Recon units.  Like most young recruits, Bywater travels the world for the first time as a soldier and waxes poetic on the beauty of numerous foreign landscapes and sunsets.<br />Eventually Bywater marries.  However, once he weds his dedication to the hardships of soldiering diminishes.  Hence, his transition to the police.  The author then meticulously outlines the faults of the police (limited budgets and heavy work loads) which forces the silent illness of PTSD to disable him.  This is a well-written book.  Fortunately, Bywater is on his way to recovery and offers a touching tribute to his wife Mel.  Recommended.<br />Bert Ruiz	2004-02-28

On that note, \\"The Eagle's Shadow: Why America Fascinates and Infuriates the World,\\" by Mark Hertsgaard is a careful snapshot of what people outside the United States consider \\"American flaws.\\"  Still and all, the author is quick to report that throughout his travels he discovered a remarkable paradox...that nearly all the foreign critics admired our wealth and longed to come here.<br />America is a subject that never fails to get people talking, according to Hertsgaard.  The world harbors plenty of complaints about us...particularly the Bush administration, he adds.  The heavy-handed invasion of Iraq, the withdrawal from the Kyoto Treaty, the withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missle Treaty and our refusal to join the International Criminal Court top the list of complaints.  Moreover, the author reports that, \\"no one wraps self-interest in moral superiority quite like Americans do.\\"<br />America is without question the richest and most powerful nation in the world...but its glaring ignorance of the rest of the planet reflects badly on the United States, according to Hertsgaard.  Include the climate of intimidation orchestrated by the Bush administration and you have the variables that explain why the United States has lost the world's admiration and respect, he adds.<br />Nevertheless, the critics of America all admit that we are still a land of opportunity.  To this end, Hertsgaard examines our shameful treatment of Indians and Blacks...and points out that the world's proudest democracy is too self-righteous.  He then concludes that the United States is a democracy in progress and urges Americans to nurture a global spirit of clarity and reason.  This book is an eye-opener.

To this end, the author has very likely crossed a dangerous line in Colombia's Civil War and has exposed himself to enormous danger.  Because by bravely documenting the links between Colombia's ruthless narco-paramilitary death squads, the Colombian armed forces, the Colombian National Police, powerful landowners and corrupt members of the two-party political establishment...he has made many bitter enemies.<br />This book is about the tragic rise and fall of a Colombian political party called the Patriotic Union(UP).  Dudley painstakingly interviews the key political actors in the Colombian Communist Party and senior members of the FARC guerrilla organization who were responsible for the establishment of the UP.  At the beginning there was much hope that the UP party could break the rigid chains of Colombia's two party system and foster a reform minded peace.  However, Dudley's impeccable research demonstrates how powerful members of Colombian society were not prepared to accept a political party (that was officially sanctioned by the government) because it was sponsored by the Communist Party and a revolutionary guerrilla army (FARC).<br />Consequently, a sinister dirty war was conducted.  The government intentionally fell silent while the Army and well-financed paramilitary death squads exterminated the UP.  The body count was horrific.  A total of 111 members of the UP were murdered in 1987; 276 were assasinated in 1988; and 138 were butchered in 1989.  Within ten years thousands were slaughtered.  The dead included UP presidential candidates, Senators, Mayors and members of Congress.  Half-way through this book one will certainly question the wisdom of the Colombian government.  Because by allowing the murderers to go free (97% of crimes in Colombia go unpunished)...many segments of Colombian society lost faith in the State.<br />This book is well written.  It is hard to put down.  But please be warned...the violence is brutal. Dudley objectively portrays the terrifying bloodshed inside the borders of Colombia and it is very ugly.  He also diligently documents how paramilitaries brag of military and political support.  Moreover, the author honestly hints how the United States $1.3 billion Plan Colombia funds may be helping paramilitary death squads led by Carlos Castano.<br />This is a groundbreaking book.  Dudley is a former human rights worker and polished journalist who takes the moral high road to expose Colombia's dark secrets.  The author sadly admits that there is not enough room in one book for all of Colombia's victims of paramilitary violence. Overall, the reader will conclude that Dudley is a dedicated journalist.  He openly dares to question how the current Colombian government is audaciously trying to forgive the murderous paramilitaries (grant amnesty) and allow them to keep their drug trafficking fortunes. Without a doubt, Colombia needs a human rights truth commission like that of Peru and Guatemala to end its culture of denial and sanitize its armed forces.  However, after finishing this book one will conclude that the political elites in Colombia will never allow this to happen. Highly...highly recommended.<br />Bert Ruizbr />This book is well written.

This book describes Leah's adventure following the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team as a reporter and avid fan.<br />Personally, I was particularly impressed with the tier-one photos in the book.  The photos captures the excitement and brings the narrative to life.  This compact (92-page) book is an ideal read (gift) for kids.  It is a wonderful story of a once-in-a-lifetime adventure.

To this end, &quot;Inside the Minds: Leading Investment Bankers, The Art &amp; Science of Investment Banking,&quot; offers solid information on the many challenges for Wall Street firms.  However, some of the bankers in this text needlessly try to sell the virtues of their firms and reduces the importance of this book.<br />Still and all, Daniel B. Bayly offers an outstanding synopsis of investment banking.  He notes that &quot;knowledge is power&quot; and stresses the importance of professional client relationship managers. Moreover, he details how good investment bankers know how to &quot;ask for and get the mandate.&quot;  On the other hand, Oliver D.

His explanation of managing deals and advice for delivering bad news is superb.  In conclusion, investment banking is about making informed decisions.

It is also a deep examination of faith in a war zone.  This Vietnam War novel is a brilliant narrative with outstanding &quot;dialogue&quot; and daring &quot;Interior monologues.&quot;  However, it is clear that McAulliffe purposely wrote this book with a heavy flavor of Vietnam era vernacular.  Consequently, &quot;Purple Sun&quot; may have a deeper meaning for Vietnam vets than other mainstream readers in America.<br />Faith is a constant thread from cover to cover.  Having said that I think it is important to add that the author is not heavy-handed with it.  To this end, the age-old question of right and wrong and listening to one's heart appears again and again.  Moreover, McAulliffe addresses faith in conjuction with a soldier's sworn oath to country.  &quot;Love God &amp; Country more than your own life,&quot; is a central theme in this novel.  Overall I think the author makes a sincere effort to examine the meaning of religion in war.  He also does so with some of his most beautiful prose.<br />In conclusion, &quot;Purple Sun&quot; has a mystic - poetic dimension that only gifted writers can reach.  The transitions are polished, McAullife cleverly uses flashbacks and flashforwards to move the plot back and forth and to maintain tension (conflict) throughout the novel.  Lastly, the characters in this touching novel...Master Technical Sergeant Isaiah Ross, Lieutenant/Journalist Patric Tomas Gallo, Corporal Bill Kern and the Monk in Hue are outstanding.  &quot;So it is,&quot; with this suspense-filled book...it is a great read.

Ambrose is a book that will always be remembered.  I found the up close look at Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson and William Clark priceless.  However, the backbone of this well-researched and superbly written book is the tale of brave men exploring an unknown frontier and only losing one member of the party.<br />Moreover, Ambrose documents the &quot;essential honesty&quot; that distinguished Lewis and Clark from other explorers like Hernando DeSoto and Francisco Pizarro who were looking for gold or wanted to convert Indians to Christianity.  Ambrose also does an excellent job of informing the reader the sad truth of American Indian Policy which at the time of the expedition was, &quot;get out of the way or get killed.&quot;<br />Nevertheless, this truly special book examines Jefferson, the &quot;empire builder,&quot;...Lewis, the fellow Virginian with a rich family history and a passion for exploration and Clark, the professional soldier and pragmatic friend who provided valuable leadership during key moments of the trip.<br />Lewis, Jefferson and Clark helped the United States become a continental power stretching from sea to sea.  Ultimately, the news of Lewis and Clark's return and the subsequent published journals triggered a rush for the mountains across the nation.

He also knows a thing or two about selling books.  But I beg to differ with the author when he claims that &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right,&quot; captures his &quot;hip, sohisticated New York sensibility.&quot;  After all, Franken is a Minnesota boy who only happens to live in New York City.  In my opinion, his writing style is much more like bowling ball journalism.  As a whole, New Yorkers are more cool and do not make a habit of smacking people around with holier than thou rhetoric.  Having said that...Franken lives up to his publisher's billing as &quot;one of our savviest satirists.&quot;<br />To his credit, the author has an outstanding research group which he calls, &quot;TeamFranken&quot; (undergraduates from Harvard University) who painstakingly detail how the Republican -Conservative Right in this nation lies and distorts information.  Moreover, Franken (who is a good American) does a decent job of explaining the important fact that Liberals also love America.  To this end, Franken's book exposes nasty Republican &quot;Push Poll&quot; tactics, documents the mean-spirited conduct of Karl Rove and explains the gross White House stupidity that prompted Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont to alter the political landscape in Congress.  On a positive note, Franken also lovingly pays tribute to deceased Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone and his wife Sheila.<br />Still and all, the author is dead wrong when he boldly declares that Bill Clinton is the greatest president of the twenty-first century.  But without a doubt Al Franken is absolutely correct in concluding that the Bush/Chaney/Rumsfeld/Rice White House has embraced a political strategy of manipulating information to defy world opinion.<br />Bert Ruiz	2003-10-10

Henderson is a comprehensive, disciplined study of the breakdown of the political system in Colombia.  The author starts his text by explaining that next to the Mexican Revolution of 1910, Colombia's tragic conflict called \\"La Violencia\\" (1946-1956)is the longest, most destructive civil war to befall any nation in the Western Hemisphere during the twentieth century.<br />Henderson is a careful historian who explains that, \\"because Colombia's violence grew out of a long sociopolitical process it must be approached with sensitivity to the historical factors underlying it.\\"  To this end, the author details how citizens were so thoroughly polarized and set against one another that many people thought the monolithic political corporations inside Colombia's two-party system fostered \\"hereditary hatreds.\\" Still and all, the special feature of this text is that is presents a microcosm of a violent macrocosm.  In order to do this the author places the enormous violence in Tolima under a glaring spotlight.<br />The text is balanced.  Henderson explains how Liberals advanced the view that a reactionary \\"neo-Fascist group\\" headed by Laureano Gomez used both the army and police to commit the \\"crime of genocide\\" against political opposition inside the countryside.  He also shows how Conservatives circulated their own version of events in official government documents and in independently published monographic studies that \\"La Violencia\\" was part of a plot hatched by the communists to destroy Colombian civilization and that Liberals were their accomplices, or at best dupes in the scheme.<br />The Tolima spotlight exposes how joining a revolution to defend liberty or religion, doggedly supporting a discredited and powerless political party, or defending one's honor with machete and firearm were all consistent with values suffused in them by the Catholic Church, Colombia's traditional political parties, and a broader culture that encouraged exreme individualism within a context of hierarchy.  Moreover, political elites encouraged the violence for control of the national government and its lucrative patronage, according to the author.<br />This book is also filled with exhausting records about many of the guerrillas.  In particular, one guerrilla/bandit named \\"Chispas\\" who was know as the \\"Price of the Violentos\\" because he killed 592, wounded 81, disappeared two and kidnapped four. Henderson's narrative is complete.  He documents the start and finish of the violence right up to the return of civilian rule with the era coined, \\"The National Front.\\"  This is a worthy text.

Brusco is an eye-opening text with outstanding fieldwork and formidable conclusions.  In a nutshell, it details the tremendous success of Colombian Pentacostalism and explains why people convert.<br />Evangelical influence in Colombia dates back to a visit by James Thomson of the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1824.  However, the first evangelical missionaries to Colombia were H.B. Pratt and his wife, Presbyterians who arrived in Bogota on June 20, 1856.  Unfortunately, the powerful Catholic clergy in Colombia was clearly disturbed by the presence of the missionaries and shortly thereafter the first small congreation in Colombia was subjected to stonings.<br />Evangelical lore has it that the archbishop of Bogota published a tract condemning the Protestans as \\"heretics and Masons,\\" according to the author.  Moreover, the Catholic Church resented the widespread distribution of Bibles and the archbishop decided to hold a public burning of Protestant Bibles in the Plaza de Bolivar. However, that was not able to stop the subsequent arrival of the Evangelical Missionary Union in 1908, the Evangelical Alliance in 1918, the Christian and Missionary Alliance in 1923 and the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in 1925.<br />Brusco explains how the pace of foreign missionary activity accelerated between 1930 and 1946 but that the growth was brought to a halt by the civil war called \\"La Violencia\\" that lasted from 1946-1966.  The author also carefully explains the meaning of \\"evangelical\\" in Colombia and the underlying factors as to why the people reject Catholicism.  Additionally, Brusco asserts that because of the powerful grip of the Catholic Church, \\"in many respects evanelical religion in Colombia was and is an opposition movement.\\"<br />The text documents how the evanelical churches are less hierarchical than the Catholic and that there are few religious trappings or idolatry of saints.  Another important feature is the strong role of women and the widespred practice of not smoking, drinking or cheating on marriages.  This all adds up as a better quality of life for many Colombians who convert.  In many ways the movement has eliminated many of the \\"inherited hatreds\\" of Colombia's traditional two-party system.<br />As the only Amazon reviewer who has dedicated an extended focus to books about Colombia I would have to say that this book expertly explains the dramatic growth of evangelical conversion in Colombia.  It also objectively and comprehensively details the historical failure of the Catholic Church in Colombia.<br />Bert Ruizdolatry of saints.

It is the story of a wonderful priest who loved the poor and wanted the church to improve the quality of life for Catholics.  Pope John Paul the First was a man who would not seek to impose christian solutions on non-Christians; he was someone who was sensitive to social problems and open to dialogue; with a commitment to the search for unity; a good pastor, a good shepherd in the way that Jesus was; a man who sincerely believed that the church should not be out of date but be a relevant, nurturing factor in the lives of Catholics worldwide.<br />The press called him the \\"Smiling Pope.\\"  However, in reality Albino Luciani who wished to be called Pope John Paul the First and became the first double name in the history of the papacy was a man of enormous faith.  What a shame his 33 days as pope in 1978 was the shortest stint since Pope Medici Leo XI in 1605 who only served 17 days.  In all likelihood, he had the inner strength and intelligence to be the greatest pope in the history of the Vatican.<br />To this end, \\"In God's Name: An Investigation into the Murder of Pope John Paul I,\\" by highly regarded journalist David A.Yallop is a work of monumental research and importance.  The author dares to point a finger at the financial corruption within the Vatican.  He names names...Michele Sindona, Roberto Calvi, Lucio Gelli, Cardinal John Patrick Cody of Chicago and Bishop Paul Casimir Marcinkus in Vatican City all coducted illegal activities.  And Albino Luciani was determined to put an end to it.<br />This well-written book is difficult to put down. Quite naturally it is officially condemned by the oligarchy in the Vatican.  However, I think it is important for all interested in the pursuit of truth to read this compelling book and drawn one's own conclusion.  The evidence is hard to ignore.  The conclusion is based on facts.  It is truly hard to imagine but I am know convinced that Pope John Paul the First was murdered because he dared to promote positive change and rid the Vatican of corrupt banking practices. Highly recommended.<br />Bert RuizPope John Paul the First was murdered because he dared to promote positive change and rid the Vatican of corrupt banking practices.

Sowell relies on newspapers, public petitions and hard to find political handouts to offer a vivid insight to the strategy and mobilization of early labor organizations in Colombia.  The author also provides a strong examination of the struggle for political power among members of the Conservative and Liberal parties.  Moreover, the author documents how partisan competition contributed to endemic political violence and repeated conflicts at the local, regional, and national levels.<br />Sowell also features the work of scholars Charles W. Bergquist and Frank Safford in this text to explain long-term economic trends and the impact of institutional power networks.  Overall the author explores early constitutional reforms and the origin of clientel relationships within the Colombian two-party political system. The liberalization of the economy united artisans.  However, industrialization led to urban violence and the downfall of the artisans as a strong political voice in Colombia, according to the author.<br />The lives and organized activities of Colombian artisans have both historical and contemporary importance.  Take for instance the life of early labor organizer Ambrosio Lopez, born in 1809 to Jeronimo Lopez and Rosa Pinzon.  Jeronimo was a tailor in the employ of the viceroy and Rosa made &quot;chica,&quot; a maize-based low-alcohol veverage.  Ambrosio's son Pedro, became an important banker and his grandson, Alfonso Lopez Pumarejo served as president of the Republic of Colombia in the 1930's.  Another important aspect of this book is the examination of how extreme partisan competition lead to many bloody civil wars in Colombia.<br />Bert Ruiz	2003-09-16

Taylor Parks has a special competence in Colombian - American affairs.  This 1970 reproduction of the original 1935 Duke University publication of &quot;Colombia and the United States: 1765 -1934,&quot; is little changed.  To this end, the author does an outstanding job of documenting two important U.S./Colombian pacts; the U.S. Commerical Treaty of 1824 and the Bidlack Treaty of 1846 (ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1848).  Parks also provides a detailed account of the the U.S./U.K. Clayton - Bulwer Treaty of 1850.<br />Still and all, the presentation of information in this text is choppy.  The author flashes back and forth with weak transitions and the reader often needs to flip back to make sure where he or she is in time.  Nevertheless, Parks more than likely has authored one of the best accounts of early trade (English &amp; American) in the Republic of Colombia.  Moreover, he documents many of the political problems in the new Republic and why there was strong American reluctance to get involved in Colombian affairs.<br />I had hoped that Parks would offer fresh insights to the early American involvement in Panama.  And although he does provide a comprehensive who, what, when &amp; where of French and then U.S. participation in the Panama Canal...I did not find any information that has not been reported elsewhere.  However, having said that Parks does an excellent job of defining why Colombia believed as early as 1884 that the U.S., &quot;had sinister designs on the Isthmus.&quot;  And Parks also documents how the White House was duty bound by treaty to put down the revolution in Panama that led to its independence.<br />This is an important book for students of Colombian - American affairs.  Parks is one of America's early Colombian scholars and this 1970 reproduction was done with the cooperation of the Hoover Institution of War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford University.<br />Bert Ruiz	2003-09-11

Moreover, the diverse photography on nearly every page of this beautiful book allows it to double as a coffee table selection.  But be diligent...because your guests may decide to take it home with them.<br />The author provides an extensive menu of gardens.  It includes perennial gardens, rock gardens, woodland gardens, desert gardens, shrub gardens, city townhouse gardens and even rooftop gardens.  The gardens also include a broad rande of climates, terrains, styles and sizes.  For pure artistry the \\"Garden of Roses,\\" by Bruce Krasberg in suberban Winnetka, Illinois, a city north of Chicago, on Lake Michigan is a beautiful testimony to our national flower.<br />However, my favorite garden is that of Elsa Bakalar in northwestern Massachusetts, not too far from Brattleboro, Vermont.  Her garden is actually a patchwork of individual gardens, pieces here and there that add up to an acre on a property of about five acres that includes a pond, a big meadow, and some woods.  Bakalar designed giant beds with blends of color schemes mixed in with natural backgrounds.<br />Still and all, the true value of this book for gardeners is \\"Part Two: Great Ideas for Your Garden.\\"  It includes a section on seasonal specialties, gardens in containers, statuary and ornaments and finally paths and paving.  The author also provides an outstanding index of sources of supply from plant societies, regional gardening resources, commerical seed companies and mail order nurseries.  And finally the text also has a detailed bibliography.  This book would make a great gift for the gardener in the family.  Highly recommended.<br />Bert Ruiz	2003-09-10

This book includes thirty-three short but informative essays from Englishmen who pride themselves on gardening and who offer sound advice on how to choreograph landscape.  The text also includes nearly two hundred stunning color and black &amp; white photographs of some of Englands finest country gardens.<br />Controlled symmetry, wild gravel gardens, dramatic sculpture and daring borders are all discussed within the pages of this impressive text.  Moreover, the editors include detailed plans and month by month maintenance of majestic gardens from tier one gardeners.  I especially enjoyed the variety of shapes and the evergreen contrasts of color and texture in Sir Frederick Ashton's Garden at Chandos Lodge, Eye, Suffolk.  Sir Frederick is a master gardener who was born in Ecuador and lived in Peru.  He moved to Chandos Lodge in 1958 and within twenty-five years he skillfully created one of the finest gardens in the world.<br />Another fine garden and essay included that of Sir Bernard Lovell at The Quinta, Swettenham, Cheshire.  He created a garden in which paths wind through the trees and shrubs with the flowers of spring in the undercover.  In the summer, brilliant roses and lovely clematis smother the house and walls inside the garden. Overall this is a very good book about gardens with many centuries of evolution. An added bonus of &quot;The Englishman's Garden,&quot; is that it can also double as a good coffee table book in addition to a practical guide to landscaping for intermediate &amp; expert gardeners.<br />Bert Ruiz	2003-09-07

Which means, those gritty individuals that love to roll up the sleves and work in the garden.  However, it can also be of value to those rushed working couples who don't have the time to attend to gardening needs around the house and pay professionals for the tender loving care required outdoors.  To this end, pruning is an important skill.  If done properly...pruning can enhance the beauty of a garden.  But if done incorrectly or in haste one can end up with a nightmare.<br />Consequently, \\"An Introduction to Pruning Shrubs, Trees, Roses, Climbers, and Fruit Bushes,\\" by Patrick Johns is a handy book to have around when the gardener needs to work with overgrown trees or shrubs.  Another hidden gem in this book is a comprehensive explanation of root pruning.  This relatively simple winter practice is an effective way to make a barren fruit tree produce a crop, reduce the vigor of ornamental plants, and encourage root development in young plants.<br />Overall, the author uses a clear and concise narrative to explain the different and most up-to-date pruning methods for the most popular groups of plants.  He also goes over many common situations.  However, the key to this garden pruning text is that it will allow you to be sure of making the right cut in the right place, and at the right time of year.  Moreover, each chapter is illustrated with step-by-step drawins and with color photographs to show you the results you should expect. Recommended.<br />Bert Ruiz	2003-09-02

Burack is a valuable book for writers who want to be published.  Overall this is a terrific how-to write, what-to write, and where-to sell reference book.  Moreover, the &quot;Background For Writers,&quot; section of the beginning of the book is filled with nearly twenty short, succinct essays with sound advice for writers.<br />The &quot;How to Write,&quot; section of the text is comprehensive.  It includes a detailed summary for general fiction writers advocating strong research, good characters, effective dialogue, managing emotion and piquing the reader's curiosity.  I strongly recommend that everyone read &quot;Making Every Word Count In Your Story,&quot; by Diane Lefer. It will help all writers &quot;tighten&quot; pieces and reduce rejection slips from publishers.<br />The &quot;How to Write,&quot; section also includes a sub-section for nonfiction, poetry, playwriting and juvenile &amp; young adult writing.  The nonfiction part of the text helped me publish my first book.  However, I was very impressed with Diane O'Hehir's piece on page 337 titled, &quot;Becoming a Poet,&quot; and with Jennifer Shepherd's, &quot;In Praise of Rhyme.&quot;  Additionally, David Copelin's &quot;Creating Effective Stage Characters,&quot; in the playwriting section is an eye-opener.<br />One must not overlook the &quot;What to Write,&quot; editing, marketing and interviews sections of this text.  The information will help the author  understand the challenge ahead once a manuscript is accepted.  The interviews include conversations with P.D. James, Russell Banks, Arundhati Roy, Joyce Christmas, Elmore Leonard, Joan Didion and Peter Mayle.  Anyone truly serious about a career in writing should read this section at least twice.  The interviews are precious.  Finally, &quot;Where to Sell,&quot; at the end of the book is a pragmatic guide with thousands of suggestions for contacts.  Recommended.<br />Bert RuizRuiz	2003-09-01

Blair is a brilliant look at how the price of crude oil was determined by giant petroleum companies (the seven sisters) and a dozen members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).  Blair traces the history of these controls and explains how they recklessly triggered the 1970's global energy crisis.<br />This 1976 publication is a classic.  To this end, Blair spent thirty-two years in the federal government.  He started in 1938 as an author of monographs for pre-World War II investigations.  Early on, he made his name focusing on the sizable concentrations of economic power in the oil industry by the Rockefeller family and family foundation.  Afterwards he spent nearly a decade with the Federal Trade Commission as an Assistant Chief Economist and finally Blair spent fourteen years as Chief Economist of the Senate Subcommittee on Anti-trust and Monopoly.  What makes this book truly special is the author's enormous access to critical government information.<br />Blair describes the oil industry's principal tax preferences, which worked to the advantage of the major companies and against smaller nonintegrated companies that could have favorably altered the availability and price of oil to consumers.  The author also goes into great detail to reveal how the &quot;Arab Embargo&quot; that set the stage for the massive oil price explosion of October 1973 - January 1974 had little impact on supply and that in reality there was no crude oil shortfall.  Ultimately, Blair emphasizes the need for developing alternate energy sources in the future.<br />This book had its genesis in a special 1973 Ford Foundation Energy Policy Project.  The final result is a groundbreaking examination of the dramatic profits of oil companies.<br />Bert Ruiz	2003-08-29

And I agree.  The corporate world is always interviewing...they are always on the look for new talent.  In many cases, they need to be better than simply ask, &quot;where do you want to be in five years.&quot;<br />Believe or not there truly are many typical errors you want to avoid when interviewing.  To this end, you will find a healthy discussion on how to avoid mistakes here.  Moreover, this book will help you navigate the tricky interview process. Chapters two and three are terrific.  Chapter two outlines the ten stages of the interview.  And chapter three covers the conversational dynamics of interviewing.  This book even includes a chapter on interviewing excercises.<br />All in all this book is a valuable tool for everyone interested in making journalism a profession.  The gathering of information in journalism is primarily done by oral means.  Consequently, it makes sense to seek the knowledge of a book that helps you control an interview and how to handle sensitive issues.  Highly recommended.<br />Bert Ruiz	2003-08-23

Authors Caroline Moser and Cathy McIlwaine do an excellent job of identifying the categories of violence affecting poor communities, the costs of different types of violence, the effect of violence on social capital, and the causes and effects of social exclusion in Colombia.<br />Violence-related problems emerge as the single most important type of problem facing the poor. Moser and McIlwaine break down the types of violence.  They report that 54% of violence is economic, 32% is social and 14% is political.  They also conclude that violence is Colombia's key development constraint. Ultimately the authors share the community perceptions of solutions to violence in Colombia.<br />However, one of the most important features of this &quot;World Bank&quot; study is the enormous amount of statistical data that quantifies the violence in Colombia.  Moreover, the text does not fail to examine the characteristics and impact of drug consumption.  The overall evaluation of drug - related problems is comprehensive.  And finally the text documents the prevalence and importance of gangs, militias, and other violent organizations that are important indicators of the high level of distrust of state security and justice systems in Colombia.<br />This outstanding &quot;Conflict Prevention and Post-Conflict Reconstruction,&quot; text reports the extensive nature of violence in Colombia and offers sound public policy recommendations.

David Rockefeller was born in 1915 and this book is a examination of the role he played in domestic and global economic affairs during the past 50 years.  Moreover, it also provides a strong window into his wealth and how he and his family funded many worthy causes.<br /><br />The author examines the good, the bad and the ugly.  He describes the evolution of Rockefeller Center in New York City with pride, he admits his support for the Vietnam War was at odds with that of many in the nation, and he pragmatically describes the many frictions within his own family.  However, an important insight of this book is how David Rockefeller played an enormous role in U.S. foreign affairs.<br /><br />To this end, David Rockefeller is clearly one of the most important executives in the history of Wall Street.  Rockefeller joined the Chase Bank in 1946 as an assistant manager in the Foreign Department and his memoirs describe his rise through the ranks to become chairman of the board.  The author admits the road at Chase was bumpy and writes that at one point he feared he would be fired by the board of directors.<br /><br />The historical value of this book cannot be underestimated.  Rockefeller examines the life of his grandfather, his writes about his many travels...particularly to the Soviet Union, China and the Middle East.  I found his chapter on the Shah of Iran fascinating.  Overall, this book is easy to read and offers front row insights of how international banking impacts global affairs.<br /><br />Bert Ruiz	2003-08-19

He diligently contacts and interviews many senior officials in the United States, Israel and the United Kingdom but fails to provide any credible documentation explaining why the USS Liberty was attacked.  Moreover, he does not explain why nearby American planes failed to defend the crew while under attack for two hours.  A total of 34 Americans died in the attack and 171 were wounded.<br />Key USS Liberty veterans helped the author's investigation. They are still furious that the United States government bullied them into silence and accepted Israel's explanation that the attack was a regretable mistake.  Certainly this book offers a sensational side to the Six-Day War never told.  However, the author does not provide convincing proof...only mountains of hearsay and speculation that the bombing of the USS Liberty nearly caused World War III.

Certainly conditions have improved in Colombia since the publication of this text in June of 2001 but government power still resides in the big cities and is diminished in the countryside.  However, the one nugget of research that the authors wisely publish is that Colombia has some of the largest untapped petroleum reserves in the Western Hemisphere.  It helps explain why Colombia is the third largest receiver of U.S. foreign aid in the world after Israel and Egypt.<br />Still and all, a big point of this book is that the heralded President Clinton/Pastrana &quot;Plan Colombia&quot; U.S. aid program is a &quot;doubtful strategy,&quot; according the the authors.  Moreover, the central government's loss of authority, economic deterioration, social disintegration, the development of an underground criminal drug economy and the dangerous growth of armed challenges to the state's authority are all well-documented and discussed.  The text also offers sound advice to the core problems, particularly the human rights violations by the violent actors in Colombia.  Overall, this sleek and compact book is a valuable guide to the complexity of the crisis in Colombia.<br />Bert Ruiz	2003-08-08

Sylvester Mawson is a fascinating compilation of expressions from more than fifty languages...from Afrikaans to Zulu.<br />I found this book looking for a popular saying in Spanish I half remembered. It was, \\"Libro cerrado no saco letrado,\\" which means, \\"a closed book never makes a scholar.\\" On the next page of this exquisite book I found the interesting German expression, \\"Liebe kann viel, Geld kann alles,\\" which means, \\"love can do much, money can do everything; love is mighty, but money is almighty.\\" This is the type of book you can spend an hour thumbing through...it is also great food for thought if you are a writer and want international flavor.<br />Do you know, \\"a vol d'oiseau,\\" means \\"as the grow flies,\\" in French or that, \\"a vostro beneplacito,\\" means, \\"at your pleasure; as you will,\\" in Italian? One of the favorite foreign terms I found in this book is, \\"azeite, vinho e amigo, o mais antigo,\\" a Portuguese expression which means, \\"oil, wine, friend...the oldest is the best.\\" This is a seriously researched book with clear, precise definitios. In my opinion it is a great book to have in the family library.<br />Bert Ruiz	2003-08-06

Stern is a collection of essays that vividly documents a revolution that only brought suffering and death.  This five-part book traces the roots of the Shining Path from its heady beginning to the conquest that failed.<br />Part One is dry.  However, Part Two &amp; Three generate much more interest.  I found Ponciano del Pino, Nelson Manrique, Orin Starr, Jo-Marie Burt and Patricia Oliart the best of the bunch.  They crystallized the subject...bringing it to life and provided stimulating insights.<br />Shining Path started in rural Ayacucho in the late 1970's and eventually made its way into the urban centers, particularly Villa El Salvador outside of Lima nearly ten years later.  Initially Shining Path was ethical and moral.  The Founding Father of the movement Professor Abimael Guzman instructed his Indian followers to punish adultery, alcoholism, vagrancy, robbery and cattle rustling. Moreover, the young flocked to the revolutionary rhetoric of a &quot;people's war.&quot;<br />Early on the Shining Path maintained good ties with the peasants in the countryside.  However, this did not last for long because in 1983 - 1984 the armed forces implemented a brutal &quot;dirty war&quot; that forced the guerrillas away from traditional regions of support and into new territory where they too used fear and intimidation tactics against the local peasant population.<br />Eventually, the Shining Path went out of control...conducting terrible massacres against unarmed civilians and forcing children into its ranks.  The tide turned against the Shining Path with the 1990 election of President Alberto Fujimori.  The new president accelerated the organization of self-defense groups among the unprotected peasant population with the distribution of shotguns, rifles and handguns.<br />The unfortunate part of the Shining Path revolution was that the poor were trapped in violence from both sides.  However, the true downfall of the Shining Path is that at the end they were nothing but ruthless terrorists who preyed on the poor.<br />Bert Ruiziolence from both sides.

For the most part, &quot;The Harper Dictionary of Modern Thought,&quot; is an indispensable reference book that belongs in every home library. Our book has also had steady usage from our kids who normally gravitate to the Harper Dictionary as High School term paper deadlines approach.<br />The Harper Dictionary explains 4,000 key terms, from philosophy, psychology, the natural and social sciences, history and politics, the arts and religion.  In each case the text provides short, clear explanations written by 140 leading British and American experts.  The text also provides excellent cross references to aid further investigation.  All in all, this a handy academic tool to have around.<br />Quite frankly, this is a very impressive collection of information but one should not be intimidated.  It is easy to use...(the authors dedicate a section at the beginning of the text on how to use the book).  For example, as I open it to page 545, it has...&quot;Rio Treaty, risk analysis, rites of passage.&quot;  Each subject includes concise sentences with bibliographical references.

It is well-deserved and overdue.  To this end, \\"Gaitanismo, Left Liberalism, and Popular Mobilization in Colombia,\\" by W. John Green dares to study a controversial populist movement.  His work is groundbreaking and his analysis in some cases exceeds that of highly regarded historians Richard Sharpless and Herbert Braun.<br />Jorge Eliecer Gaitan is arguably the most important politician in the history of Colombia. Green dedicates a decade to examine the life of Gaitan...the sire of the Gaitanista movement. However, in the words of the author, \\"this study...is more about Gaitanismo and the left-Liberal political culture from which it sprang than about Gaitan per se.\\" Gaitan is the authentic defender of working and undervalued classes and a man who always diligently escaped the stain of official corruption and scandal.<br />In a nutshell, Gaitanismo was the first independent, mass-based, popularly oriented mobilization of its magnitude in Colombian history.  Green tracks Gaitan's career from the Colombian Congress, to the Senate, to the Ministry of Labor, to the Mayor of Bogota, to Minister of Education and finally to the leading presidential candidate in the nation at the time of his mysterious assassination on April 9, 1948.<br />Green starts by digging into Colombia's past and exposing the wide historical divisions in the Liberal Party.  He also pulls no punches and provides an excellent documentation of Colombia's elite-dominated political system.  Unfortunately, according to Green, \\"for all its political vigor, the system was prone to domination by powerful groups and individuals...given to arbitrary decisions and less than democratic procedures.\\"<br />The author also dedicates much time to the many clashes Gaitan had with his bitter political enemy Laureano Gomez, the dominant power in the Colombian Conservative Party. For the most part Conservative Party elites and even some members of the Liberal Party hated Gaitan and \\"exhibited a near universal mixture of fear, anger and loathing,\\" Green writes.  According to the author, to Gomez \\"the only route to salvation was the Roman Catholic Church, he was antagonistic to all breeds of Liberalism and insisted that those who disagreed were not only wrong but evil.\\"  Eventually many Colombians end up despising Gomez for his heavy sympathizing with Italian Fascism and German National Socialism before and during World War II.<br />Green admirably concludes that \\"the allure of Gaitanism sometimes seems unworldly.\\"  This book is comprehensive and well-balanced.  And carefully explains why the Colombian oligarchy unleashed a brutal counter-revolution to eliminate the political<br />call for social and land reforms immediately after the assassination of Gaitan.<br />Bert RuizParty hated Gaitan and \\"exhibited a near universal mixture of fear, anger and loathing,\\" Green writes.

This book is not a stuffy academic classroom text...it is a sleek, extremely funny and stimulating resource that will undoubtedly add tremendous value to your knowledge of writing the \\"Queen's English.\\" Moreover, Professor Quinn's book is super provocative, superbly written and succinct...allowing the reader to go cover to cover in a few short hours.<br />Quinn challenges the reader...\\"We are confronted, inescapably, with the intoxicating possibility that we can make language do for us almost anything we want.\\"  In other words, the author \\"thinks outside the box\\" long before it became fashionable to do so. I'll never forget a groundbreaking banner front-page headline in the New York Daily News back in the 1970's, it read, \\"We Wuz Robbed!\\" The headline reported that masked gunmen broke into the payroll office and stole millions in typical New York City lingo.  Apparently the editors in the Daily News Building agreed with Quinn's approach to effective writing that \\"style, is like a frog: you can dissect the thing, but it somehow dies in the process.\\"<br />Each chapter in this marvelous book is short and compact.  My favorite chapters include, Missing Links and Headless Horsemen, Man Bites Dog and Reds in the Red.  In a nutshell, Quinn demands that we navigate the jungles of style creatively and includes many figures of speech through out his book to stimulate the learning process.  Overall, this book is a joy to read.  In the words of the author, \\"language becomes a prison house only poets can escape...if we do not reject any strict distinctions between ordinary usage and figures of speech.\\"<br />Bert Ruiz	2003-07-27

Certainly, every High School student across the United States is well aware of the importance of George Washington but what about Simon Bolivar? Or Jose de San Martin for that matter? These men are great Western Hemisphere military generals responsible for freeing most of South America from strict colonial rule?<br />Bolivar, often affectionately called the Liberator, freed Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia from Spanish oppression.  San Martin freed Argentina and Chile. To this end, Bolivar had a boyish hero worship of Washington and regularly drew inspiration from the North American revolution. An added bonus of this book is that the author does an excellent job describing Bolivar's critical relationships with other dynamic Generals, particularly Antonio Jose de Sucre, Francisco de Paula Santander and Jose Antonio Paez.  The narrative also documents the enormous importance of British and Irish volunteers who joined Bolivar and the struggle against Spanish rule.<br />The narrative starts with Bolivar's privileged childhood, his intellectual growth and finally his decision to lead his people to liberty.  Bolivar is a great man, who frees the black man from slavery 46 years before Abraham Lincoln's 1862 Emancipation Proclamation.  He also refused to be King and chose instead to be his nation's first President...like he beloved George Washington.<br />Baker downplays his many romances and the tuberculosis that eventually killed him.  Nevertheless, the text is meticulously researched, well-written and objective.  Although this book was published in 1941, it is still very relevant today and would be an excellent choice for a High School history book report or detailed term paper.  The text is also complete with many beautiful black and white illustrations. Highly recommended.<br />Bert Ruizommended.<br />Bert Ruiz	2003-07-26

Appy is a glowing tribute to everyone who fought, aided, suffered or protested the Vietnam War. If anything, the one consistent thread in many of the individual snapshots of the war is that the leaders in Washington underestimated the will of the Vietnamese people.  Moreover, the author documents many of the White House & Pentagon decisions that lead to the death of 58,193 American men & women and the loss of 8,588 aircraft.<br />The Vietnamese accounts of the war are powerful.  The hardship of the jungles, the constant hunger, the simple importance of sandals and the dangers of the American air war are all communicated in short vivid passages.  Appy also provides ample evidence that the South Vietnamese government was brutal and corrupt and few American officials in the government or military cared to insist on democratic reforms.  However, do not mistake the author's intentions...this book is not an apology...it is an honest account of an American tragedy.<br />Vietnam is the longest war in the history of the United States.  Overall the Vietnam war has generated hundreds of books and dozens of movies and documentaries.  To this end, put this book up in the ranks of the very best.  It is an excellent journalistic report.  This book is well-researched and easy to read.  The author is able to collect the voices of the high and mighty as well of those of the poor which he skillfully weaves together to create a masterpiece.<br />Bert Ruiz	2003-07-23

Consequently, if you are looking for a good history book on Colombia...go elsewhere. However, if you want a first class look at the military situation in Colombia from 1948 to 1973 this text is excellent.<br />The author surprised this reader in chapter two when he mentions the \\"Bogota riot of April 1948\\" and fails to mention the murder of Colombian populist Jorge Eliecer Gaitan.  Shortly afterwards when he does decide to introduce Gaitan he does so as \\"Jorge Gaitan\\"...a sure sign the author did not know or care how significant this man was in Colombian politics.  To his credit, the author does a good job reporting the details about the revolutionary priest Camilo Torres. Over all Maullin tends to give a right of center view of Colombian politics.<br />Still and all, the value of this book lies in the outstanding presentation of the Soviet - Cuban - Chinese rivalries within the Colombian guerrilla groups.  Moreover, the author understands guerrilla warfare and Colombia's guerrilla groups...his chapter on the FARC, ELN and ELP is superb.  However, I found the documentation of U.S.military aid to Colombia eye-opening.<br />The author displays a sense of humor describing the early fear among National Front leaders with events in Cuba.  Maullin describes how National Front leaders sought to implement significant social and land reforms to placate growing demands from the poor in Colombia.  However, when generous portions of U.S. military aid arrived to strengthen the Colombian armed forces the National Front leaders quickly abandoned ideas of reform, according to the author.<br />In conclusion, this Rand book gives good information on the size and budgetary cost of Colombia's armed forces and the growing amount of U.S. military aid to Bogota.  It also provides an honest assessment of the effectiveness of U.S. military aid in Colombia.  All in all, this book shows how senior American intelligence community leaders understood that the guerrillas in Colombia were dangerous and that the Colombian armed forces needed dramatic assistance to combat the threat.<br />Bert Ruizin Colombia.

The author also patiently explains how the peasant struggle for land threatened to destroy the large landowner class and its corrupt clientelist system in Colombia.<br />On that note, this Cambridge University Press carefully documents how the Spanish Conquest established the tradition of large landowner monopolization of state owned territory in Colombia.  Moreover, the text exposes how large landowners fanatically guarded the original Spanish Conquest system of Indian exploitation for over a century.  Over the years the landowner \\"process involved the racial redefinition, dispossession and subjection of the exploited population,\\" according to the author.  However, one of the troubling discoveries of Professor Zamosc's research is how Colombia's large landowner class regularly obtained large tracts of property with fraudulent practices.<br />Of particular interest is a International Bank for Reconstruction and Development report authored by renowned American economist Lauchin Currie in 1948 that proposed a controversial program for accelerated development under the name \\"Operation Colombia.\\"  In Currie's opinion, the irrational use of labor power and land in agriculture was the main obstacle to economic growth in Colombia.  It seems the plains and more fertile areas were used for extensive cattle raising, while most of the labor was being wasted in the inefficient agriculture of the worst soils of the mountain slopes.<br />Also of interest is President John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress policy in the early 1960's that argued that the large landowner development of agriculture was only aggravating the problems of unemployment and low peasant incomes and that these factors were creating \\"a dangerous social and political situation.\\"  Tragically, the landowners and political leaders of Colombia continued to maintain a rigid policy of squeezing profits from the land with little or no regard for improving the standard of living of the peasant.<br />However, this all changed with the 1966 election of National Front Liberal Party President Carlos Lleras Restrepo who nurtured the organization of peasants to help implement dynamic land reforms. President Lleras Restrepo was the first National Front leader to abandon rhetoric and actually authorize a generous amount of State funds to pave the way for a fair distribution of land.  Unfortunately, his successor Conservative Party President Misael Pastrana (1970-1974) was easily manipulated by large landowners and the government sponsored peasant movement was crushed.<br />Professor Zamosc explains how the landowners embraced the Cold War and conveniently labled the peasants (who did lean to the left) communists in order to justify the repression of the Pastrana government.  The author who's research was funded by the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development in Geneva laments how Colombia lost an enormous opportunity to introduce significant land reforms.  All in all, this 1986 publication helps explain the roots of the violence in Colombia today.

To this end, his 1957 publication of, \\"Dance of the Millions: Military Rule and the Social Revolution in Colombia 1930-1956,\\" is by far the best academic study of the brutal era coined \\"La Violencia\\" that I have found to date.  It is a pity that contemporary Latin American scholars do not give Fluharty the full recognition that he deserves.<br />The author spends many years in Colombia and makes significant observations.  For instance, he carefully argues that the true villain of violence in Colombia is not the poor masses demanding social and land reforms but an oligarchy who conducts a wicked \\"counter-revolution\\" to make sure that the feudalistic system of privilege throughout the nation remains unchanged.  Fluharty breaks new ground with his painstakingly documented thesis that the original intellectual authors of terrorism in Colombia were the rich. Ultimately, this book thoroughly documents a period of complete social failure on behalf of Colombia's political leaders from 1946 to 1956.<br />Fluharty's well-written narrative explains that until the blood bath of 1948 Colombia had enjoyed almost forty years of relative peace and progress. Government was under civilians. The constitution was honored, the press was free, and public opinion was unshackled. And then, \\"as though at the wave of some malign wand, frightful violence swept the country. Civil liberties died, opposition parties were silenced, jails bulged with political prisoners...and terror-stricken refugees swarmed to the cities,\\" he writes.<br />The author agrees with other main-stream historians that \\"La Violencia\\" was triggered by the mysterious April 9, 1948 murder of the beloved populist Jorge Eliecer Gaitan.  However what makes Fluharty special is his honest conclusion that the bloodshed did not start in earnest until \\"a united front of oligarchs from both the Liberal and Conservative parties...temporarily discarding partisan differences, joined forces across party lines to halt land reform, labor unionism, agitation for higher wages, and other campaigns aimed at raising the general standard of living of the masses.\\"  Eventually, after hundreds of thousands were butchered, the Army stepped in on June 13, 1953 to stop the civil war.<br />Fluharty courageously exposes the strong Nazi overtones and Pro-Franco fanaticism of Laureano Gomez and the destructive, selfish motives of the Colombian Conservative Party.  This is a rare book that shows how the rich in Colombia collectively turned back the clock on progressive government and replaced it with a mean-spirited and murderous police state.

To this end, I bought this book because of my strong interest in Colombia and was attracted by the title of the book, \\"Drugs, Oil, and War: The United States in Afghanistan, Colombia, and Indochina.\\"  I would have never bothered to buy this book if I knew that nearly half of it is a rehash of Scott's 1972 publication, \\"The War Conspiracy: The Secret Road to the Second Indochina War.\\"<br />Part I, \\"Afghanistan, Heroin, and Oil (2002) and Part II, \\"Colombia, Cocaine, and Oil (2001) is good.  Scott makes some excellent observations about paramilitary relationships.<br />Moreover, he carefully explains how paramilitary forces in Afghanistan and Colombia are heavily involved in drug trafficking.  Nevertheless, the narrative of this book is coated in left of center rhetoric...and as a political moderate I found some theories lacked intellectual merit.  To his credit, Scott's provides professionally prepared footnotes and bibliography.<br />Bert Ruiz	2003-05-20

The author divides the text into four parts; Introduction to the War Problem; Causes of War; The Contemporary Situation; and Proposals for Solving the War Problem. Part one is a conceptual and historical framework of war; part two probes the cause of war and examines mainstream views and values of war; part three is a strong inspection of the military and institutional behavior of war; and part four is an analysis of reforms.<br />Professor Glossop correctly opens the narrative in part one with a succinct but powerful message, &quot;War is about power and the use of physical violence to determine which party in a conflict will prevail.&quot; From this starting point onwards the author presents a sophisticated array of information certain to aid the war discovery process. Overall, this book is well researched and expertly written. Moreover, the notes and bibliography are superb.

To this end, Clinton's extraordinary political skills and a smart move away from the left and to the soft center of American politics paved the way for victory.<br />Evan Thomas also cites three other critical factors...\\"it is the economy...stupid,\\" the unpopular personality of Newt Gingrich and the polling genius of Dick Morris as helping Bill Clinton defeat Bob Dole.  But the main theme of this book is that the former governor of Arkansas had an enormous appetite for work and an uncanny ability to communicate with the American people.  Certain parts of the narrative is a passionate upclose account of Bill and Hillary Clinton as husband and wife as well as political partners. Other parts of this book looks at how the prospects for a second term were shadowed by the scandals of Clinton's first four years in office.<br />In the final analysis the \\"Comeback Kid,\\" great man or not...did have a remarkable gift for politics and this won the day.  Baby boomers had come of age, moved to the suburbs, borne children, and planted the seeds of a postmodern political agenda.  They wanted a president that would help them cope with the cares of everyday life...work and family, schools and doctors, safe streets and clean water.  The Republican Party offered a solid political platform but Bill Clinton's colorful promise of a \\"Golden Age\\" outlasted Bob Dole's plain \\"Black & White\\" strategy for America.<br />Bert Ruiz	2003-05-16

McGinniss explains that the basic advertising concepts remained unchanged right up to 1968 but that Richard Nixon made every use of all the sophisticated technical advances of the day.  Moreover, the author details how slick New York advertising men seduced voters which elevated them from the smoky parlors to the expensive suites with the political big shots.<br />Advertising executives allowed Nixon to dominate the airwaves.  To this end, the television campaign allowed Nixon to get through the campaign with a dozen or so carefully worded responses that would cover all the problems of America in 1968.  After a while it is rather clear that Richard Nixon is basically a boring man. However, with proper packaging Nixon soon represented competence, respect for tradition, serenity, faith that the American people were better than people anywhere else, and that all these problems others shouted about meant nothing in a land blessed with the tallest buildings, strongest armies, biggest factories, cutest children, and rosiest sunsets in the world.<br />I found the marriage of political and advertising minds fascinating.  Of particular interest is how certain keywords such as conscientiousness, vigorous, party unifier, newness, glamour, humor, warmth could create a television facade to hide a candidate's blemishes.  This is a great book and should be used in the classroom to show how television altered how politics and campaigns are orchestrated in the United States.<br />Bert Ruizsroom to show how television altered how politics and campaigns are orchestrated in the United States.  <br />Bert Ruiz	2003-05-12

However, this book is worth reading...particularly if you are a political junkie like myself.  \\"Behind the Oval Office: Winning The Presidency in the Nineties,\\" offers a front row seat to White House political strategy.  To this end, the one conclusion that all will agree upon with this book is that President Bill Clinton is a slave to the polls.<br />In many ways this book reveals how shallow politics can get.  Morris is an extremely influential political actor in the Clinton White House and is able to expertly navigate the President through the dangerous aftermath of the 1994 Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole midterm Republican advances.  Moreover, there is no doubt that Morris laid the foundation for Bill Clinton's second term victory.<br />Morris does not enjoy the victory...he goes out in disgrace.  Nevertheless, this book shows how the author's twenty-year relationship with William Jefferson Clinton and his wife Hillary allowed this couple from Arkansas to survive many political storms.  Morris is a master of polling and offers many insights on how polling tracks voter thinking on many sensitive issues.  This book is easy to read and a straightforward account of how the \\"big boys\\" win in the political arena.<br />Bert Ruiz	2003-05-10

Harris and Mary Lee Morrison do an outstanding job of explaining what peace education is.  Moreover, the serious study of militaristic thinking and the worldwide struggle for peace is both succinct and provocative.<br />&quot;Peace Education,&quot; is a comprehensive book.  I found chapter two, &quot;Religious and Historical Concepts of War, Peace and Peace Education,&quot; and chapter three, &quot;The Practice of Peace Education--What Does it Look Like?  Types of Peace Education,&quot; excellent.<br />The authors explain, &quot;the struggle for peace, if it is to be successful, must also provoke courage, must be understood as a heroic task, and must recruit thousands if not millions of converts willing to renounce violent means to settle disputes.&quot;  They also suggest that there must be a strong understanding of the calamity of war to promote peace.<br />The practice of nonviolence and love in the affairs of human beings is an important field of study.  This book covers sensitive issues in peace education, how to overcome obstacles and visions for a more hopeful and interdependent world.  Professor's Harris and Morrison provide a clear-cut analysis of peace education and the practice of pragmatic rules to seek positive social change.<br />Bert Ruiz	2003-05-05

Vistica is a powerful journalistic examination of the political manipulation of American taxpayer dollars and the disgraceful treatment of women who had answered the nation's call to service.  However, be warned...it is also filled with excessive and graphic X-Rated pornagraphic narratives.<br />The author does a worthy service in documenting how Secretary of the Navy John Lehman, a President Ronald Reagan appointee in 1981 orchestrated the largest peacetime naval buildup in the nation's history.  Vistica explains how the rallying cry for building the fleet had been the Soviet bogeyman.  Moreover, he documents how the Navy had known all along that the Soviet Fleet was defensive in nature and not a threat to the United States. Consequently, the American taxpayer paid the bill for an excessive expansion that included a \\"six hundred ship Navy\\" that was not needed and mothballed at great expense.<br />This book also focuses on the role of women in the Navy and gives a step by step account of the hidden dirty laundry at the prestigious U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.  Vistica also displays intimate details of the infamous Navy and Marine aviators Tailhook Association annual gatherings in Las Vegas.

Rausch is a thorough and stimulating study.  However, upon completion of this well researched book one will no longer think of the Llanos frontier as the source of brave warriors during the wars of independence or of the many myths of romantic, picturesque, freedom loving cowboys. Instead, one will discover a region where cattle rustlers and outlaws roamed the plains with impunity and terrorized local ranchers.  Moreover, this book will reveal many of the political blunders of Colombia's obtuse Conservative Party.<br />Rausch does an outstanding job of documenting the political careers of four giant Colombian Liberals.  Presidents' Enrique Olaya Herrera (1930 - 1934), Alfonso Lopez Pumarejo (1934 - 1938) and Alberto Lleras Camango (1958 - 1962) are examined in great detail. Rausch also does an excellent study of the legendary Colombian populist, Jorge Gaitan who was murdered before he could assume the presidency in 1950.  Of great significance, the author demonstrates how progressive Liberal Party initiatives shattered draconian Conservative Party controls and vastly improved the standard of living for ordinary Colombians.<br />The text also includes population, tax, budget, crop and export data for the Llanos region. However the true value of the important book is that it objectively documents the inflamed political hatreds between the Conservative and Liberal Parties that preceded Colombia's brutal and bloody era appropirately called &quot;La Violencia.&quot;<br />Bert Ruiz	2003-04-10

Moreover, it is presented from a liberal perspective...which is quite evident in the dedication of the book to the legendary and super-controversial Colombian Roman Catholic priest/revolutionary guerrilla Camilo Torres Restrepo.<br />Dr. Orlando Fals Borda, Professor of Sociology at the National University of Colombia wrote this book during the academic year of 1966-1967 in Spanish while he was a visiting Professor of Sociology in the Institute of Latin American Studies at Columbia University in New York City.  The translation by Jacqueline D. Skiles is outstanding.  The significance of this important text is the sharp focus on three important periods; the early civil wars, the rise of Jorge Eli&eacute;cer Gait&aacute;n and Camilo Torres Restrepo's confrontation with The National Front.<br />In attempting to define \\"subversion\\" the author starts out by explaining that the first rebel of this type was probably Moses, who rallied his people against the tyranny of the Pharaohs.  He goes on to explain that Colombian rebel groups since 1850 have had a sincere desire to build a new society but are seen as evil, dangerous, and even traitorous.  He adds that for every revolutionary group that historically appears in Colombia...an opposite oligarchical movement he terms \\"La Mano Negra,\\" arises.<br />According to Dr. Fals Borda, incongruity, discordance, inconsistency, anomie, and moral crisis are the traditional attributes of the situation of conflict in Colombia.  Colombia's first conflicts were conducted by \\"Caudillos\\" or warlords who became hacienda-owning aristocracy by taking over large tracts of uncultivated lands from \\"Indians.\\"  Interestingly enough, the catalyst for the major civil wars of the 1850's according to the author, \\"derived principally from personal convictions, from confidence in the morality of their ideas, from a certain chiliastic tendency that sharpened confrontations with other groups; in short, it derived from religious fanaticism.\\"<br />\\"The voice of the future in Colombia,\\" took place in 1922 with a group of young intellectuals formed in Bogot&aacute; and called themselves, \\"Los Nuevos,\\" or the new group.  The group included many young men from elite families but it also included a giant socialist from a more modest background named Jorge Eli&eacute;cer Gait&aacute;n.  Fals Borda goes on to explain how Gait&aacute;n unites a multitude of social, labor & land reform, university and communist groups with the poor masses.  In the face of the serious threat of a decisive victory by Gaitan in the 1950 presidential elections, \\"which could at last effect the imposition of subversion so feared by rightist bourgeois groups in the government itself...the power elite played its last card: violent repression.  Gait&aacute;n was assassinated on April 9, 1948,\\" the author writes.<br />The National Front was caused by an exhaustion with the lost of life.  However, shortly after the 1957 start of the National Front, \\"the economic and social homogeneity of the ruling class formalized as an advantage for imposing its inherent compromises,\\" Fals Borda concludes.  To this end, Roman Catholic priest Camilo Torres Restrepo arrives from study in Europe in 1959 to publicly demand that National Front leaders do more to combat the terrible poverty in Colombia. Dr. Fals Borda commends Father Torres's enormous dignity and thirst for humanism in Colombia.  He explains that Torres offered the government of Colombia a system of promoting positive change \\"oriented by brotherly love.\\"  He then describes how Torres crossed a dangerous line when he says, \\"the oligarchy has a double standard by which, for example, it condemns revolutionary violence while it itself assassinates and imprisons the defenders and representatives of the popular classes.\\"<br />This book is not that easy to read.  Dr. Fals Borda is a towering intellectual and offersmany lengthy but profound explanations of subversion and social change in Colombia.  Nonetheless, this is an excellent book and offers serious insights to the flaws in Colombia's democracy.<br /><br />Bert Ruizof subversion and social change in Colombia.

Prior to Colombia, Hargrove worked in Vietnam and the Philippines...hence he knew of the many dangers of working in foreign countries.  Moreover, he was well aware of the wave of kidnappings in Colombia but nevertheless chose to continue his work.<br />Parts of Hargrove's diary are heartbreaking while other sections are pathetically boring.  Consequently, this book lacks the backbone of a true narrative.  One is subjected to the day to day ordeal of over 300 days of captivity.  If anything, this book is glaring evidence of the brutality of this guerrilla captors.  Fortunately, Hargrove does march to freedom and he is able to publish his diary in captivity.

Martz does a massive study of the domination of politics and society by political elites in Colombia.  Martz dismisses rumor and scandal, using honest research to piece together a glaring examination of political rule in Colombia.  The end result...Martz clearly cares for the Colombian people and shows how the selfish practice of &quot;Clientelism&quot; in the political system circumvents improving the standard of living inside the borders of the nation.<br />Martz explains that &quot;Clientelism involves sets of patrons and clients cooperating with one another to retain maximum benefit for themselves from all assets which any of them handle by personally exchanging these assets among themselves.&quot;  In essence, Martz demonstrates that much of the political system in Colombia is built to serve those in power.  The author does an exhausting study that shows how the majority of politicians are loyal to the party and not to the people they represent and who elected them to office.<br />The author also focuses on the 1991 constitutional reforms that &quot;rehabilitated the rule of law.&quot;  The democratic reforms banned &quot;Clientelism&quot; and pork-barrel legislation.  Moreover, the fortification of democratic rule prevented Colombian Congressional representatives from holding other public position while in office.  Still and all, the political system was not completely sanitized, according to Martz.  This is an excellent book with a close up study of every Colombian president from 1958 to 1997.

Osterling writes a comprehensive and thoughtful book.  Moreover, &quot;Democracy in Colombia: Clientelist Politics and Guerrilla Warfare&quot; is essential reading in order to decipher the complexities of Colombia's democracy.<br />Osterling explains that Colombia differs from other hemispheric nations in that it is a country of semi-autonomous regions, each with its own cultural, economic, political, and social structure.  Bogota, the nation's capital is the administrative center of Colombia but its citizens are quite different from those in Medellin, Cali, Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Cucuta, Manizales, and Pereira, according to Osterling.  This simple observation is key to understanding Colombia's regional rivalries.<br />Still and all, the author's major point is that inequalities in income distribution is a significant socio-economic problem.  Osterling points out that, &quot;A small, privileged minority controls a disproportionate percentage of the national resources and uses them for their own benefit, while a larger, less privileged majority lives under tighter budgets.&quot;  Finally, Osterling warns, &quot;In theory all Colombian nationals are equal before the law; however, in practice, there are sizable inequalities of access to effective enforcement of civil, economic, political, and social rights.&quot;<br />Osterling is an outstanding scholar.

The author dedicates many years, abandons law school and runs up credit card debt to research and write a glaring historical account of the struggle between large landowners and the poor in Guatemala.<br />Wilkinson's early focus is on the 1950 presidential victory of Jacobo Arbenz Guzm&aacute;n.  He then explains the daring 1952 implementation of a far-reaching Agrarian Reform law called Degree 900.  The author reaches out to Guatemalan students who favored the reforms and declared that peace, \\"required greater equality and greater equality required a redistribution of land in the countryside.\\"<br />Wilkinson then flashes back to 1892 when twenty-three-year-old Friedrich Endler leaves Germany for Central America.  Endler eventually becomes a large coffee plantation owner and it is through him the author explains the historical struggle with poor illiterate workers who provide the labor that builds a coffee nation.<br />From there Wilkinson flash forwards to 1954 and the carefully choreographed CIA overthrow of democratically elected President Guzm&aacute;n.  Shortly thereafter agricultural students protested, \\"We who receive an education paid for by the people have a debt to the people! We who have the power to analyze have the responsibility to criticize! An agronomist should carry, in one hand, a machete...and, in the other, a machine gun.\\"<br />The remainder of the book is a painstaking tale of documenting the State terror of the 1980's when 200,000 Guatemalans perished.  Quite frankly, parts of this book are brutal.  Nevertheless, the author must be commended for risking his life and traveling to the interior and urging the poor to testify before the Guatemalan Truth Commission that officially investigated the atrocities of the armed forces.<br />In conclusion, Daniel Wilkinson courageously points a finger at Washington for being so obsessed with the fear of insurgency that they rationalize away qualms and uneasiness.  He even quotes an American embassy official who was uneasy with early military abuses and wrote in 1968, \\"the record must be made clearer that the Untied States Government opposes the concept and questions the wisdom of counter-terror; the record must be made clearer that we have made this known unambiguously to the Guatemalans; otherwise we will stand before history unable to answer the accusations that we encouraged the Guatemalan Army to do these things.\\"  Unfortunately, no one in Washington was listening.

Early on President Lyndon Johnson is shown to have a long political career of stretching the truth...starting with his alleged heroic air combat role in World War II.  Robert McNamara is a towering intellectual who is not afraid to manipulate statistics to support his Cold War position or that of the president.  The pattern is contagious as the Joint Chiefs of Staff also maintain upbeat reports that do not properly reflect the reality in Vietnam.<br />\\"Dereliction of Duty,\\" is an eye-opening book that documents how powerful leaders in Washington D.C. who were bestowed with an enormous trust by the American people betrayed the young men and women who answered the nation's call in Vietnam.

This book is clearly written and well researched.  The conclusions are stunning...Lyndon Johnson, Robert McNamara and the Joint Chiefs of Staff [mislead] the American people.

Moreover, prize-winning author Felipe Fern&aacute;ndez-Armesto is both a \\"ferociously intelligent scholar\\" and an immensely successful \\"popular historian.\\"  To this end, this book is rare because you may never look at history the same after reading it.<br />Fern&aacute;ndez-Armesto looks at the millennium from an imaginary distance and creates spectacular unifying themes.  In order to do so, he breaks the 1,000 years into five basic sections; Part One - The Springs of Initiative;Some Civilizations a Thousand Years Ago; Part Two - The Springs Uncoiled;The Reach of Conquest; Part Three - The Atlantic Crisis;The Redistribution of World Resources; Part Four - The Twist of Initiative;The Decline of Confidence and the Erosion of Empires; and Part Five - The Pacific Challenge;Oriental Resilience and Western Culture.<br />The narrative explores and creatively explains the historical importance of Christendom, Islam, China, Imperialism, Colonization, Industrialization, Commerce, Militant tendencies,<br />and Technology.  The text also has dozens of wonderful pictures and drawings to enhance the narrative.  The author covers a lot of ground but in doing so he has created an enduring book.<br /><br />Bert Ruiz	2003-02-22

The author leaves few stones unturned...as a result the research is absolutely profound.  &quot;Jorge Eli&eacute;cer Gait&aacute;n&quot; is a legendary Colombian populist who unfortunately is assasinated before he can fulfill his political ambitions.  To this end, Braun carefully documents the fact that had he not been killed, Gait&aacute;n would have certainly won the 1950 presidential elections in Colombia.<br />Braun tells the complete story of Gait&aacute;n...the politician who boasted that he was not a man...he was a village.  The author painstakingly demonstrates the enormous importance Gait&aacute;n played among the poor.  Moreover, Braun also does an excellent job of showing how Gait&aacute;n filled a gigantic void in Colombian politics.  Unfortunately, the assasination of Gait&aacute;n triggered the conflict that haunts Colombia to this day.  In my professional opinion, this is an spectacular book and must be read by everyone with a special competence in Colombian - American affairs.<br />Bert Ruiz	2003-02-18

Nevertheless, it is of extreme value for any journalist attempting to understanding the roots of the reporting industry.  \\"Reuters: The Story of a Century of News-Gathering,\\" by Graham Storey with a commendable foreword by Lord Layton is necessary reading for the budding journalist and a wise investment for the veteran reporter.<br />This book is about the founder of Reuters...Paul Julius Reuter.  The start of the book dates back to 1851 and the use of the infamous \\"pigeon postman.\\"  However, in reality \\"Reuters\\" is also a story of how eminent European Jewish thinkers realized that they earnestly needed to abandon their old exclusiveness and become full citizens of their adopted countries.<br />Julius Reuter arrives in London among the crowds of foreigners in 1851 and quickly realized that the financial markets desperately needed quicker news distribution.  From these humble roots...an empire unfolded.  However, it wasn't easy and this book documents the many problems with the power politics in Europe.<br />In conclusion, this book is about a family business.  It includes an facisnating study of the expansion of the British Empire and the sturdy new world of journalism.  I particularly enjoyed the narrative of World War II.  However, I think its safe to warn that the many laurels of the \\"Reuter family tree\\" detracts from the serious objectivity of this book.	2003-02-14

However, the key to the success of this book is the minute by minute, hour by hour countdown of how Americas pulled out of Vietnam.  The text is enhanced by outstanding photos.<br />Anyone interested in examining the hasty withdrawal from Saigon should read this intimate book.  Butler knows the cast of journalists and many of the key American embassy players.  Consequently, he has managed to complete an amazingly credible manuscript of how the U.S. failed to keeps its promise to thousands of Vietnamese.

To that end, \\"More terrible than death: Massacres, Drugs, and America's War in Colombia,\\" is an absolute masterpiece.<br /><br />Author Robin Kirk is brutally honest and quite frankly...very lucky to be alive to tell this story. Upon completing this book the reader will conclude that Kirk is a sincere and thoughtful student of the human condition in Colombia. Kirk is also a front line witness of a secret and savage dirty war. To this end, she is able to draft a brilliant synopsis of the violent actors in Colombia. Kirk is special. She refuses to lose her cool despite being surrounded by death. Her polished prose calms. Kirk's words do not jump off the pages and shout at you...instead they cling to you and then sink to the bottom of your soul. The end result is a deep disgust of the Colombian government for not protecting defenseless civilians outside the big cities.<br /><br />Without a doubt, the leaders of Colombia...particularly in the military will consider this book a hard slap to the face. Kirk cleverly documents Colombia's long history of conducting a ruthless dirty war against the poor. The author uses a series of flashbacks and flashforwards to liven the pace of events. Moreover, Kirk displays an extraordinary talent for writing.<br /><br />The bottom line of this book is that the political leaders of Colombia must sanitize its armed forces of paramilitary death squads. Kirk is not a doomsday author. She does her homework and uses her intimate knowledge of life in Colombia to unfold a stirring narrative.<br /><br />This book is a surefire national bestseller that will redden the faces of Colombian leaders and boil the blood of American taxpayers. Because as Kirk brilliantly tells it...millions of dollars in American military aid...continues to flow to blatant human rights abusers in the Colombian armed forces.<br /><br />Bert Ruiz	2003-01-29

To that end, this publication successfully nurtures a better understanding and appreciation of the Old Testament.  Moreover, Gibson offers an easy writing style that offers many insightful observations that helps unlock the complexity of the language in the Old Testament.<br />I found Chapter one, &quot;The Energies of the Hebrew Language,&quot; and Chapter three, &quot;The Rhetoric of Hebrew Prose Writing,&quot; helps foster a greater appreciation of the ancient imagery and language in the Old Testament. I must admit to being only a moderate reader of the Old Testament and to having struggled over and over penetrating the secrets of the language.  Hence, I found &quot;Language and Imagery in the Old Testament&quot; to be an excellent companion to the Bible.<br />Admittedly, the Old Testament is deep and open to many interpretations.  Consequently, not everyone will agree with all of Gibson's conclusions.  However, I have found Gibson's scholarship to be comprehensive, objective, inspiring and a good faith effort to improve our understanding of the many mysteries in the Bible.	2003-01-18

In \\"A Rumor of War,\\" author Philip Caputo offers us an intimate portrait of the Vietnam conflict.  Caputo uses a powerful lens and provides an up close examination of what the war is like for a Marine infantry \\"grunt.\\"<br />This book is about the Vietnam danger, the boredom, the casualties, the weather and the mood of the American soldier.  Throughout the book one can feel the soldiers enormous desire to \\"go home\\" and abandon the macho madness of the Vietnam tragedy.  Caputo's protagonist, the element that moved the plot is the Marine's desire to survive.  The author brilliantly uses the constant threat of \\"death\\" to act as a powerful antagonist that lurks from page to page.<br />Best of all, this book documents the brutality of war using the language of the Marine \\"grunt.\\"  Hence, it provides a front row seat to the thoughts and emotions of those who were condemned to risk their lives each day while in Vietnam.

To this end, Author Seymour Hersh puts his considerable reputation on the line and uses his powerful contacts in Washington to painstakingly document the shallow political and career motives of Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger.<br />Hersh does a tremendous service to America.  He single-handedly destroys the myth that Nixon and Kissinger were dedicated to the swift end of the Vietnam war.  To his credit, Hersh documents the formation of Nixon's secret \\"Madman\\" policy and how the President and Kissinger employed this risky strategy to prolong the war.<br />\\"The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House,\\" is also a serious study of how certain key cabinet members that opposed the manipulation of foreign policy were quickly isolated and discredited.  Hersch interviews key individuals that Kissinger personally recruited to work at the NSC to show how significant contributions to foreign policy was wrestled from the State Department and firmly established in the White House.  The early consolidation of power by Nixon and Kissinger set the pattern for a long string of dark policy.<br />The secret bombing of Cambodia, the crisis in Korea, the SALT talks, the Mideast, Cuba, China, the Berlin settlement are all explored in this text.  However, the most damaging information to the reputation of Henry Kissinger is how his secret information to the Nixon campaign during the Johnson administrations peace talks in Paris compromised any chance of reaching an early conclusion to the war.  Hersh meticulously researches how Kissinger manipulates his contacts in Paris to circumvent the practice of conflict resolution by Lyndon Johnson.  Hersh also explains how Kissinger used this secret information to position himself on Nixon's short list of foreign policy advisors after the defeat of Hubert H. Humprhey in the 1968 presidential elections.<br />There is little flattery of the 37th President of the United States in this book.  If anything Hersch displays the ruthlessness of the Nixon White House and how Henry Kissinger would sacrifice everything to implement a dark policy that cost thousands of lives.  In conclusion, this book is a bitter pill for the brave young men and women who answered the nation's call in Vietnam.the 37th President of the United States in this book.

To this end, author Mark Baker collects a vast series of comments from many of the brave men and women who answered the nation's call to duty.  In doing so, Baker captures the terrible bloodshed of the Vietnam war.<br />The only negative factor of this book is that Baker is not a veteran.  He is a journalist who did not serve in Vietnam.  Consequently, a few of his snapshots are open to question. They certainly make for good copy but as a two tour USMC Vietnam vet I offer with absolute certainty that some parts of this book do not ring true.<br />Nevertheless, this is an important book.  Baker reaches out to vets and allows them to bare their soul.  Some sections of this book are horrible.  Others reflect well on the quality of the American fighting man.  All in all, any young kid who foolishly thinks war is glorious and that the battlefield is a place of honor should read this book.  It will probably save his or her life.	2003-01-16

Author Greg Vistica clearly establishes himself as one of the finest young journalists in America with the publication of \\"The Education of Lieutenant Kerrey.\\" This book is penetrating, provocative and painful. It is also bound to accumulate many journalistic laurels for its extraordinary fairness and maturity.<br />The plot of this explosive nonfiction book is whether Bob Kerrey conducted an atrocity or orchestrated a war crime while leading an elite team of Navy SEAL commandos in Vietnam. The facts are straightforward. Vistica spends three long years putting the puzzle together. His big break takes place when the most credible member of Kerrey's Vietnam SEAL team admits the young Lieutenant from Nebraska ordered the brutal murder of unarmed civilians...mostly women and children. Some were carved up with knives and the others were riddled with bullets from point blank range. The evidence collected by Vistica is so compelling you will have to suppress the urge to vomit in horror.<br />Unfortunately at the conclusion of this book one is left to think that Bob Kerrey is not a hero. In defense of the former Senator Americans must bear in mind...it was the poor decisions of politicians that created the Vietnam quagmire. In addition, the many brave soldiers that answered the nation's call were subjected to a sinister White House and Pentagon obsession with \\"body counts.\\"<br />Still and all, Bob Kerrey is his own worst enemy by authoring misleading and inconsistent explanations.

Consequently, the text is a little choppy but overall this is a worthy book.<br />&quot;The Underdogs,&quot; is a marvelous narrative of the Mexican Revolution.  The protagonist is a poor farmer who rises to the rank of guerrilla general with bravery and an endless streak of luck.  To that end, the book is a blow by blow account of the brutality of the revolution and the hardships the poor suffered from both sides.<br />However, as the plot unfolds the author skillfully dismantles the lofty liberal idealism of how the revolution improved the quality of life for the masses.

However, \\"Out of War; True Stories From the Front Lines,\\" offers a frightening new dimension of the conflict.  Author Sara Cameron documents the tragic lifes of young poor Colombians who are disgusted with the violence and seek to reduce the warfare by fostering a better understanding of peace.<br />On the one hand, this book is uplifting.  It is a sparkling display of courage.  However, sprinkled throughout nearly each narrative is the reality that death is always present and that the violent actors still continue the pattern of killing unarmed civilians.  The reality is so great that not one of the young poor adults that writes a testimony of how the conflict has impacted them dares to point a finger to whom is responsible for the murder and intimidation.  All are careful to remain neutral and not trigger the anger of those responsible for the ruthless violence in Colombia.<br />Hats off to Redepaz(Colombia's Peace Network),UNICEF, The Red Cross and the Catholic Church for nurturing peace among the young.  This book also provides useful web sites to learn more about the children's movement for peace in Colombia.  Upon completing this book one is filled with pride for the bravery of the young in Colombia.  But one is also saddened by the stark reality that the young suffer a great deal.  Finally, this book promotes a greater awareness of the children's movement for peace but also drives home the fact that the young are defenseless to the harm of poverty and violence in Colombia.	2002-12-29

She takes on an explosive subject and attempts to reshape traditional thinking.  Moreover, she is not reluctant to point to weak assumptions by other scholars or to excuse local political or economic elites of liability.  Ultimately, &quot;Civilization and Violence,&quot; is a clinical examination of nineteenth-century regimes of representation in order to explain the long pattern of conflict within the borders of Colombia.<br />By no means is this a knock on this fine work but it is important to note that the language throughout this text is excessively highbrow.  Rojas is a brilliant scholar but writes this study for the exclusive benefit of the academic community.  Consequently, journalistic readers be warned...there is little pragmatic flow in the language of the analysis.  Nevertheless, this is a valuable book.  Rojas painstakingly connects many valuable theories in helping explain the complex relationship between civilization and violence.  She also documents how domination by local hierarchies result in &quot;hate dynamics&quot; that has set &quot;the battle lines&quot; of the future.	2002-12-29

Lael writes an objective account of a difficult diplomatic period between the United States and the Republic of Colombia. U.S. policy toward Colombia from 1903 to 1922 is undoubtedly heavy-handed. However, Lael patiently explains that Washington's decisions were much more \\"strategic\\" than \\"economic.\\"<br />The mysterious Panamanian revolution against Colombia in November of 1903 is explored in great detail. To that end, Lael examines the policies of Theodore Rossevelt, William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson in relation to that revolution and existing treaties. He also does a great service criticizing several American historians and journalists that dishonestly defended U.S. policy during this period by distorting the facts.<br />The American isthmian dispute with Colombia is finally resolved in 1922. Lael describes how the rights and sovereignty of Colombia are trampled for \\"Manifest Destiny.\\" He also takes pains to explain how other Latin American neighbors considered U.S. policy both interventionist and dangerous. Overall, this book is an honest attempt to study self-serving and insensitive American diplomacy.<br />This book is filled with valuable nuggets of information. I found the portrayal of Senator Henry Cabot Lodge fascinating and was not aware of the great rivalry he had with President Wilson.

James William Park does an exhausting study of Rafael N&uacute;&ntilde;ez.  Moreover, he explains in great detail how regional differences destroyed attempts for national unity.  Still and all, this book is dry.  Facts are compressed and do not always come to life.<br />One feature I found valuable is the description of Colombia's many civil wars.  Although the text does not go into great detail exploring the events leading to the &quot;War of the Supremos&quot; from 1839 to 1842 it does an outstanding job of defining the political differences that lead to the civil war of 1860 - 1862, the civil war of 1876 - 1877 and the civil war of 1884 - 1885.<br />This well-researched text also has excellent charts with data on government federal expenditures, federal income, income from customs and valuable regional population statistics.  Park includes an excellent protrayal of the many problems between the Liberal and Conservative parties.  He also defines the many problems implementing national railroads, a national education policy and negotiating the delicate relationship with the Catholic Church.<br />Any serious student of Colombian - American affairs must read this book to understand the long government pattern of ignoring the needs of citizens in the interior of the nation in favor of those in the big cities.  Overall, Park explains how Rafael N&uacute;&ntilde;ez overcomes many political and personal obstacles to unite Colombia under one flag.	2002-12-19

This book is his diary of the key role he played in searching and destroying enemies of the Colombian people from 1960 to 1965.  Sergeant Buitrago is a braggart, self-righteous and takes pleasure in killing bandoleros(bandits).  He is also a poor and biased writer.<br />Nevertheless, this book is an excellent account of the bloody, brutal and barbaric period in Colombian history called, \\"La Violencia.\\"  Moreover, Buitrago is honored with the prestigious Cross of Boyaca by the Colombian government for his bravery and eventually he is promoted to the highest rank possible for an enlisted man.  So although he exaggerates on just about every page of his book Buitrago does risk his own life often and in doing so offers a first hand look of how much unarmed civilians suffered during this terrible period in Colombian history.<br />This book is not for the weak of heart.  Buitrago is a calloused military veteran who describes death, rape, torture and massacres as if it is as common as having a cup of coffee in the morning.<br />Russell W. Ramsey writes an outstanding introduction of the text.  He objectively and succintly explains Colombia's legacy of violence.  In addition, the translation of this University of Alabama Press book by M. Murray Lasley is first class.	2002-12-14

Bell-Villada won me over in the first few pages of \\"Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez: The Man and His Works\\" when he wrote, \\"to this day I have not forgotten the sheer excitement I felt on first reading Cien a&ntilde;os de soledad in 1968, and my utter bedazzlement on reaching its concluding paragraph. Since then the idea of writing on the great South American author for his North American devotees has been one small dream of mine.\\"<br />To that end, Bell-Villada, a professor of romance languages at Williams College does not disappoint. This comprehensive and engaging book is a well-written study of Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez and his work. The research in this two-part book is meticulous. Part one is background on Colombia, the writer's life and his politics. Part two is a stimulating history of Macondo and a strong examination of the works. Both parts are filled with valuable information that helps explain Colombia and its long history of violence.<br />Bell-Villada is a good teacher. He patiently goes into great detail describing the expert use of fantasy, humor and satire. He also examines literary technique and structure in a simplistic fashion. The bottom line of this beautiful book is that it enhances the understanding, appreciation, and respect of the work of Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez...the greatest living novelist in the world.	2002-12-01

His magnificent 1998 home run race with Mark McGwire captivated the nation.  Afterwards he was invited to the White House and made a special Ambassador to his native country, the Dominican Republic. However, what few people know is how hard Sammy Sosa worked to reach stardom.<br />&quot;Sosa an Autogiography,&quot; is a special story.  In fact, it is inspiring.  Sammy Sosa grew up poor.  He was skinny and initially wanted to be a boxer.  However, his talent for baseball came out from urging of his older brother and the support of his devoted mother.<br />Co-author Marcos Bret&oacute;n details the early years of Sosa's early major league career in Texas and then with the Chicago White Sox.  It was a difficult time for Sosa, going up and down from the major and minor leagues.  Nevertheless, Sosa worked hard and never lost hope.  The trade to the Cubs and his rise to stardom was the result of a strong dedication to excellence.<br />Perhaps, the greatest part of this book is Sosa's loyalty to his family, the people of the Dominican Republic, and the fans of the Chicago Cubs.  Although Sosa has reached great heights he still wants the fame that is associated with winning the World Series.  This is a great book for kids and adults alike...the bottom line is &quot;hard work works.&quot;	2002-11-30

Still and all, the author does a splendid job a capturing the &quot;zeitgeist&quot; of this vibrant era that was spurred by a brash young president enamored with &quot;Manifest Destiny.&quot;<br />This is a book that is hard to put down.  Most avid readers will go cover to cover in 48 hours. Boyd's masterful command of dialogue keeps the plot moving at a brisk pace.  Moreover, Boyd is a polished writer who constructs a powerful protagonist who shines in moments of conflict.<br />This book is much more than a swashbuckling account of a dynamic moment in American history.  Boyd is a deep writer and nurtures a strong understanding of a young nation boldly storming onto the world stage as a global superpower.	2002-11-29

He uses his vast knowledge of South American history to weave fact &amp; fiction into a fasination account of a true &quot;American&quot; hero.<br />In the author's note at the beginning of the book Boyd explains he uses historial documents and official archives for his personalities and actions.

To that end, \\"La Cocina Colombiana,\\" has them all. Want to know how to prepare food from the coast...no problem, from Medell&iacute;n...piece of cake, from Bogot&aacute;...get the picture?<br />Moreover, there is a terrific guide for making many of the typical fruit and alcohol drinks in Colombia. Quite frankly, I cannot say enough good things about this book. On the downside, the text is in Spanish but my seventh grade son who has only studied Spanish for two years, can read or figure out the reciepes with few problems.<br />Overall, this is a delightful book filled with instructions for preparing fruits, vegtables, soups, salads, meats, poultry, fish and fabulous deserts normally found in Colombia. An added plus is the polished photographs of each meal. In my opinion this book is a bonanza for anyone who loves Colombian food. If you are looking for a great cook book gift...\\"La Cocina Colombiana; paso a paso,\\" will bring great joy to any kitchen worldwide.	2002-11-27

In my opinion, this book must be included in anyone's library of books on Colombia.  The quality of this large text is outstanding and the historical information of the importance of gold in Colombia is impeccably researched.  Moreover, the introduction by President Virgilio Barco is a wonderful testimony to Colombia's special culture.  This book is the next best thing to a ticket to Colombia's dynamic Gold Museam in Bogot&aacute;.

Instead I prefer to call Alta Colombia: Splendor of the Mountains, &quot;a work of artistic brilliance.&quot;  This book is a stunning and powerful portrayal of Colombia's mountains.  Unfortunately few people outside the borders of Colombia are aware of the &quot;summits and perpetual snows that crown the great mountain range of the Andes.&quot;<br />To that end, Crist&oacute;bal von Rothkirch and Juan Pablo Ruiz are knowledgable environmentalists and expert mountain climbers who mangage to capture breathtaking scenes from remote areas of Colombia.  We have had this book on our coffee table for years.  And it always manages to get rave reviews.  With the holidays coming up soon...I think it is a great gift idea.<br />This book is not limited to mountains.  It also includes impressive frames of giant condor's, other rare birds, rocks, fields, native indians,plants and much more.  &quot;Alta Colombia: Spendor of the Mountains&quot; is a book filled with a wide display of colors, some are soft and while others are quite bold.  It also boasts some great photographs of nature's intimate relationship with the sun.  Colombia is blessed with great beauty.

Some of the gardens in &quot;Gardens of Colombia&quot; are very old and offer wonderful views of mature walkways, paths and streams.  My favorite pages are those that show unique Colombian courtyard gardens.  In short, this Villegas editores publication is a paradise of garden landscapes and a perfect coffee table book.	2002-11-23

However, the genius of this book must not limited to such simplistic observerations.<br />This Spanish language text is a masterpiece of light and color.  The fact that it includes some bare bodies is secondary to the spectacular display of glimmering Colombian jewelery and colorful traditional costumes.  Although this book is sensual in nature and may be a turnoff for bland coffee table collectors I consider it a work of art and a fine contribution to a serious library.	2002-11-23

To that end, her book explores significant moral questions and offers sound leadership guidelines.  However, \\"Center of the Storm\\" is bannered as the definitive account of the controversial November 7, 2000 presidential election in the state of Florida.<br />On that note, this book is a journalistic dud. She fails to answer crucial questions.  Moreover, some appraisals of her work are self-serving.  In conclusion, the controversy swirling around the performance of the Florida Secretary of State during a sensational period in American history will not subside with the publication of this book.

To that end, I appreciate it more with each reading.  Hemingway is a powerful writer.  He says little but suggests so much with his prose.  This book is about love and war on the Italian Front in World War I.  It is also a canvas of words rich in colors and full of emotions.

He has a great sense of humor, a strong work ethic, the ability to love deeply and a strong dedication to his faith.  However, his biggest asset is his heart.  Chet Bittterman is a giver.  He wants to help others and finds himself in Colombia with his linguist wife and two young children.  Somehow, the M-19 terrorist group considers Chet and his group of linguists a threat and kidnap him.  This young man, who had so much potential sadly is killed when the M-19 demands are not met.<br />Steve Estes writes a great book.  He went to school with Chet and does his homework in writing this manuscript.  Estes understands Colombia and will surprise anyone with a special competence in Colombian affairs with his knowledge of the political and economic landscape.  \\"Called to Die\\" is a tragic book.  It is such a pity that a fine young man who posed no threat to anyone and is in Colombia to help the Indians is killed.  This book is a tribute to Chet Bitterman.  He will never be forgotten.	2002-10-20

Moreover, &quot;Inside the CIA&quot; is both objective and comprehensive.  Kessler uses his remarkable access to key actors in the CIA to lift the Agency's curtain of secrecy.  He also dares to expose agency blemishes and is critical of organizational failures.  I found his review of the Cold War outstanding and appreciated his detailed breakdown of how each Directorate functions within the Agency.

The author explains how Johnson inherited a \\"God-awful\\" mess eminently more dangerous than the one Kennedy had inherited from Eisenhower.  One evening not long after he took office, Johnson confessed to his aide Bill Moyers that he felt like a catfish that had \\"just grabbed a big juicy worm with a right sharp hook in the middle of it,\\" McNamara writes.  In the last two chapters, \\"Estrangement and Departure\\" and \\"The Lessons of Vietnam\\" McNamara bravely admits many mistakes.

She also happens to be a pretty good writer.  \\"The True Story of Volcanic Disaster at Galeras and Nevado Del Ruiz\\" is a gripping tale of human error and vanity.  Bruce reports how Colombians relied heavily on American and European volcanologists for guidance and funding.<br />The book is two parts.  The destruction of Armero and its 23,000 residents by Nevado del Ruiz is one of the world's worst disasters.  However, the tale of what took place at Galeras is far more interesting.  It uncovers fraud.  It shows that Stanley Williams promoted his career at the expense of others and proves that his scientific arrogance led to the unnecessary loss of life at Galeras.<br />In addition, Victoria Bruce masterfully conquers two major obstacles in this book.  First, she explains the complexities of geology in a simplistic fashion and secondly she properly describes the violence inside Colombia with intellectual honesty.	2002-07-16

However, the killing, rape and torture of children in Colombia has never hit the global media radar screen until now.  Robin Kirk painstakingly documents the abuse of children in Colombia.  However, the most scandalous part of this book is that it clearly shows that a significant number of murders of children in Colombia is a direct responsibility of state forces.  The Colombian government has dirty hands and has been unable to control the slaughterhouse mentality of criminal elements in the military and police.  Although this book is nearly ten years old it is worth reading to see how only the rich and powerful have the exclusive use of justice in Colombia.	2002-07-13

US	52599173	R2CBCGAZX9COZH	0316052949	128881022	Our Man Is Inside	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A thriller	Ambassador Diego Asencio bravely reconstructs his 61 days of captivity in Bogota.  The siege takes place at the Dominican Republic Embassy and is carried out by Colombia's revolutionary M19 guerrilla organization.  This book is a rare look at how the captive diplomats played a large role in securing freedom.  It is also testimony that the honest practice of conflict resolution can bring positive results.  It is a small miracle that only one person died during this epic takeover.  Much credit must be given to the diplomats in capitivity.  Ambassador Asencio is a polished writer and does an outstanding job of objectively describing the highs and lows of his days in captivity.	2002-07-12

The accounts come from the very poor in Colombia.  To that end, most of the voices are female.  Journalist Constanza Ardila Galvis does an outstanding job of capturing the views of the poor in the Colombian countryside.  However, she is guilty on two counts.  One...the views are overwhelmingly pro-guerrilla and secondly her prose is too melodramatic.  Nevertheless, this is an important book that documents the suffering of the rural and urban poor war inside Colombia.  Two quotes stuck in my mind when I finished this book.  The first was by Laura who said,\\"the hatred against those who persecute and murder us kept me in the struggle.\\"  And Angela who said, \\"I continue to be convinced we must keep dying, giving birth and bringing up soldiers for the revolution.\\"  On a positive note, all the voices in this book conclude that a non-violent and just solutions must be sought in Colombia.  The bad news is that no one knows how to get there.	2002-07-11

He is a maverick and proud of it.  In a nutshell, Zinn wants a government that represents the interests of the majority...not a select few.  Moreover, he dares the reader to challenge conventional wisdom and examine events through his special prism.  &quot;The struggle for justice should never be abandoned on the ground that it is hopeless,&quot; the author nobly argues.  It is a major theme in chapters one through eleven of his book.  Overall the author points a lot of fingers at our leaders for promoting aggression in foreign policy. In my opinion, Zinn's &quot;cross-examination&quot; of American idelology is a good book to read during our 4th of July holiday.	2002-07-03

Colombia is a nation on its knees in the late 1980's and early 1990's.  Drug lords and their powerful paramilitary armies intimidate the nation.  If the drug lords can't corrupt you with money...they kill you.  To that end, Mar&iacute;a Jimena Duz&aacute;n is an outstanding Colombian journalist for El Espectador and does a gutsy job of documenting the origin and growth of paramilitary activity throughout the nation.  Although this book was published in 1994, it helps explain the violence in Colombia today.  Sadly, the author's sister is murdered by a paramilitary death squad she is investigating.  This book is an excellent stepping stone to understanding the illegal links between the armed forces and paramilitary death squads in Colombia.	2002-07-02
