Ronco has experience in the software industry so it is with personal knowledge and experience that he crafts the story of artificial intelligence and the future of the technology industry.  Ronco presents this novel as what could be a worst case scenario with software terrorism and a future where this could be an issue as serious as nuclear war.<br /><br />Dianne Morgan is the CEO for VantagePoint Software, the maker of Atlus, the most popular computer operating system in the world and one which is in nearly ninety percent of the world's computers.  This obviously brings to mind a company called Microsoft.  Morgan brought to trial by the United States government in an anti-trust lawsuit and her company is broken into smaller companies.  This is something that has happened several times in our nation's history.  Her revenge is to unleash a computer virus called Peacemaker.  Peacemaker has the capability to infect and shut down nearly every computer on the planet.  Her goal: nothing less than global domination.  The only man who can stop Peacemaker is Ray Brown, a software developer who helped make Atlus the most popular piece of software on the planet.<br /><br />The novel becomes something of a cat and mouse game as Ray stumbles across Peacemaker and learns of the scope of this virus which is so sophisticated that it is an artificial intelligence.  Dianne Morgan is preparing to unleash Peacemaker on the world and while she needs to stop Ray she also wants to convert Ray to her side since they share a past together.<br /><br />The concept behind \\"Peacemaker\\" with the ideas of software terrorism and the artificial intelligence and just the scope of the issue is fascinating and helps the reader press on through the book because I certainly wanted to know how things played out.  The problem is the writing and the characters.  The characters seem to be mainly one dimensional and Ray's inner struggles regarding his alcoholism seem somewhat childish.  The other characters are not any better and most are even more one dimensional.  Before each chapter there is a one or two quotes from a future newspaper or novel regarding some of the characters.  What this does is let the reader know a little bit how the events of this novel will play out and affect the world years down the road.  It kind of takes some of the tension out of the book.<br /><br />Ronco has a good deal of potential as an author because he has one very important gift that can't be taught: the ability to come up with a very interesting story idea.  I have no doubt that his skill as a writer will come as he continues to write.  \\"Peacemaker\\" was a very fast and easy read, but it is not without some serious flaws in the execution of the novel.

Those who have read Timothy Zhan's \\"The Last Command\\" will be very familiar with this space battle as this is the battle which closes the Thrawn Trilogy.  Now we see it more specifically from the perspective of the Rogues.  But where this battle was conclusion in Zahn's  book, it is only prologue in \\"Isard's Revenge\\".  With Thrawn now out of the way, the New Republic must further solidify its authority throughout the galaxy and the best way to do this is to take the fight to the warlords who have carved out little niches of galaxy for themselves.  To start, the New Republic will attack a warlord named Krennel.  Krennel provides the New Republic some moral authority in their military action because in his rise to power he had murdered several political figures including an entire family and it is under the pretext of bringing Krennel to justice that the New Republic will take him down.  Assigned to this, of course, is the Rogue Squardron, the best of the best.<br /><br />At the end of \\"The Bacta War\\", Ysanne Isard was presumed killed when her shuttle was destroyed at Thyferra.  Thus was one of the nastier elements of the Empire eliminated.  But she didn't die and she is back trying to bring Krennel into power.  Or...is she?  As the former Intelligence Director of the Empire her motives are her own and are seldom shared with others.  As events unfold the Rogues begin to believe that it is possible that Isard really is alive.  The thought is frightening, but they have a mission to do.<br /><br />Michael Stackpole's four previous X-Wing novels were suburb.  They were fast paced, exciting, and often funny.  I was looking forward to reading \\"Isard's Revenge\\" moreso than many other Star Wars novels.  Here Stackpole slows down the pace and somehow the novel does not work as well as his previous books had.  The reason why is unclear.  It features the same characters and many of the same traits that made the other novels so good but this one is lacking \\"something\\".  It is difficult to say what except that this book is not as fast paced, exciting or funny as the others.  It is still a decent enough story, but the action does not have the same sense of importance compared to Isard's release of the Krytos virus in the early X-Wings.  The stakes are lower.<br /><br />Still, X-Wing is one of the best parts of the world of Star Wars and \\"Isard's Revenge\\" is book 8 of 9.  It is worth reading for fans of Star Wars, Stackpole, and X-Wing.  It is just not quite up to the level of the first four X-Wing novels.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryeatures the same characters and many of the same traits that made the other novels so good but this one is lacking \\"something\\".

An Ironman Triathlon is a race consisting of a 2.4 mile swim followed by a 112 mile bike ride followed by a marathon (26.2 miles).  Some runners may consider the marathon to be the ultimate endurance event and with good reason, the marathon is not to be taken lightly, but Ironman only lets you run a marathon after one has traveled 114.4 miles.  Since \\"Ironman\\" is actually a trademark of the World Triathlon Corporation, the \\"Ironman\\" name can only be used for a race sponsored by the WTC.  But any triathlon of 140.6 miles can be considered an \\"Iron\\" distance race and the finishers are no less an Ironman as those finishing a sponsored race.  140.6 miles is a long, long way to go, and typically there is a 17 hour time limit.  In \\"Becoming an Ironman\\" many athletes will tell of their experience in their own words.<br /><br />The stories contained in this book are broken into a variety of sections.  There are stories from those who are middle of the pack athletes and who struggled with the Ironman but still found strength to complete it.  There is a section featuring athletes who learned in their first attempt that they were quite good at this distance and turned in excellent times which put them among the leaders.  Conversely the stories of those who finished Ironman with only a minute or an hour to spare are no less compelling.  Then there are the Did Not Finish (DNF) stories of those who for one reason or another had to drop out of the race or just could not make it to the finish line in time (the one who finished some six minutes after 17 hours was tough to take).<br /><br />Every one of these stories provides inspiration to push through my pain in a race and furthers my desire to one day attempt and complete an Ironman despite the pain I know it will cause.  But these same stories collected in \\"Becoming an Ironman\\" suffers from the fact that while reading a handful of these stories is easy and inspiring, reading every story back to back becomes repetitive.  Yes, everyone struggled and gutted it out and provides a reason to be inspired, but it is essentially the same story every time with minor variations.  The different sections helps as the stories are grouped into similar kinds of experiences, but it is still a lot of take at one time.<br /><br />My recommendation is that this is an excellent book about the Ironman experience from the perspective of the average (if \\"average\\" can describe anyone attempting Ironman) athlete, but the reader should only read a few stories a day.  Each story is only a few pages long and this way there will be less of a sense of burnout by the time the end is reached.  Inspiring stuff, here.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryers from the fact that while reading a handful of these stories is easy and inspiring, reading every story back to back becomes repetitive.

The conclusion of volume two (\\"Dark Force Rising\\") left the Grand Admiral Thrawn in command of most of the legendary Katana Fleet which had been missing since before the Clone Wars.  Thrawn, working with the mad Jedi Clone Joruus C'Baoth, has also reclaimed a stockpile of the Emperor's cloning technology and Thrawn can now command the Katana fleet manned with a clone army.  In short, this is by far the biggest threat that the fledgling New Republic has faced since Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader deposed the Emperor.  The Dark Jedi C'baoth seeks to turn Luke and Leia to the Dark Side and also to raise Leia's soon to be born children has his apprentices.  The threat to the entire galaxy is very real and could touch every planetary system.<br /><br />The good guys will not let this happen so easily, of course.  Luke has an idea what C'baoth is up to and will not stray from the Light.  He will not betray what he believes to be right.  Leia is preparing for the birth of her children and also seeks to protect herself and her children from the constant attacks.  With Han, Lando, and the Droids, they are all working to keep the New Republic together, even with attacks from within.<br /><br />\\"The Last Command\\" spans the galaxy and features grand space battles,  light saber duels, various alien creatures and some political intrigue.  In short, it is everything that a Star Wars novel should be.  Timothy Zahn really set up the Post-Return of the Jedi novels to have quite a storyline and showed the other authors just how to tell a Star Wars story.  By no means is this a perfect novel, and there are parts that drag far more than it should considering that this is Star Wars, but the good far outweighs the bad and the continued development of Mara Jade is a big plus.  The Thrawn Trilogy is perhaps the perfect place to begin reading the Star Wars novels.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry	2005-09-20

Han Solo and Lando Calrissian are working to discover the identity of the intelligence leak within the New Republic High Council.  As they work on this they learn of the leak they learn of the existence of the legendary Katana fleet which disappeared decades before.  Leia Organa Solo is seeking to convince the Noghiri race to stop hunting her and to abandon their servitude to the Empire.  Luke Skywalker, on the other hand, feels a call of a long lost Jedi Master named Joruus C'Boath.  Joruus is quite insane and also happens to be a clone of the real Jedi Jorus C'Boath who was lost during the Clone Wars.  The Grand Admiral Thrawn seeks to claim the Katana Fleet for his own and to crush the Rebellion, as he still sees it.<br /><br />There is a lot of plot in this book, and while there is a slow start and I felt for at least half of this book that \\"Heir to the Empire\\" was far better, \\"Dark Force Rising\\" picks up midway through the book and by the end I was just as impressed as I had hoped to be.  It is very easy to see why Timothy Zahn's trilogy provided the spark which led to so many more Star Wars novels.  These are well told tales featuring our favorite characters from the movies and they are brand new adventures.  In the midst of the hundred or so Star Wars novels it is easy to forget that these books here really set the stage and while there were Star Wars novels written before \\"Heir to the Empire\\", nothing really compares to this series and this is really the standard for all future Star Wars novels.<br /><br />Not a perfect book, by any means.  \\"Dark Force Rising\\" is definitely a middle novel with all the flaws therein, but in the realm of Star Wars this remains one of the better novels even a decade later.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry	2005-09-08
US	52402330	R25PJQUA71SJJ	0965518728	203315050	The Ultimate Guide to Marathons	Books	4	2	2	N	N	excellent guide, just a little out of date	\\"The Ultimate Guide to Marathons\\" is an excellent marathon resource for runners.  This second edition was published in 1998 with information current up through 2000.  A runner using this book as a guide needs to know that in five years a lot can change for a given marathon.  A good example of this is the poorly managed Lakeshore Marathon in Chicago which recently had an issue of the course being measured incorrectly and being a mile too long.  Information like this would be critical in any new edition of \\"The Ultimate Guide to Marathons\\".  However, if you are able to accept this potential shortcoming of slightly out of date information and use this book as exactly what the title says, a \\"guide\\", then any runner can find a lot of value in this book.<br /><br />This book ranks 110 marathons from across the United States and bases the rankings on such categories as fan support, race organization, course beauty, course difficulty, and how appropriate the race is for a first time marathon runner.  The description of each of the 110 marathons includes sections on the history of the race, the race course itself, what sort of awards and accommodations there are, and other details about the race.  This is excellent information.  While every major marathon in the country is included in these rankings (as of 1998), there are also quite a few small marathons that make the list.  As a Minnesotan I was pleased to see that all four Minnesota Marathons were included (Twin Cities, Grandma's, Med City, Walker North Country) and was surprised by Med City and Walker North Country because these are small marathons.  W.N.C. in particular is a trail marathon and trail races are included and ranked right along with the big ones like Boston and New York City.<br /><br />There is also a listing of approximately another 50 marathons that are typically smaller than the ones included in the ranking, and are \\"destination marathons\\", but as one that I recognized (Marathon to Marathon in Iowa) is not really a destination most people would want to go to, my guess is that these are just marathons that the authors were not able to fit into their ranking and that they ran out of time to get them included.  I may be wrong about that, though.  Either way, it is nice to see such a listing of marathons.  I am aware of other regional marathons that were not included, but I do not know when these marathons were founded.<br /><br />While the information provided in this book is several years out of date, the rankings and descriptions can be used as a guide to see if this is a marathon you are interested in running.  If so, I would then recommend looking online at the race's website or perhaps finding another online marathon guide to see if there are any changes or significant drops in runner participation.  But this book can be used as an excellent guide to get marathon ideas and if most major marathons are not changing their course or management you can expect that the rankings would stay fairly consistent overall.  That makes me happy because Minnesota had the number 2 (Twin Cities, behind only Big Sur) and the number 13 (Grandma's) marathons according to these rankings.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryowa) is not really a destination most people would want to go to, my guess is that these are just marathons that the authors were not able to fit into their ranking and that they ran out of time to get them included.

While in the 1980's there were several Star Wars Expanded  Universe novels published, it was not until \\"Heir to the Empire\\" that the Star Wars boom really took place for novels.  \\"Heir to the Empire\\" is set five years after the events of \\"The Return of the Jedi\\" and the New Republic is growing, is gaining strength and popularity.  The fight is not over, though.  Grand Admiral Thrawn is still holding on to the legacy of the Empire and he continues to fight against the New Republic.  What is more, he is actually starting to win battles.<br /><br />Thrawn takes the fight right to the heart of the New Republic, to Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa Solo.  To the unborn children of Han and Leia.  Thrawn is one of the great villains in Star Wars lore.  He is powerful, ambitious, and a fully realized villain.  He is worthy of opposing our heroes.  He may even overcome the New Republic and bring back the Empire.  This is his aim.<br /><br />In more than forty Star Wars novels that I have read \\"Heir to the Empire\\" is one of the best.  It is easy to see why Timothy Zahn was able to usher in this new era of Star Wars novels.  It is a well written book featuring our favorite characters in a new adventure and against new and interesting villains and characters.  Besides Thrawn, Zahn has also introduced  Karrde and Mara Jade, two more well written and interesting characters.  For the Star Wars fan this is essential reading.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry	2005-08-30

While there are blurbs on the back cover from elite marathoners and a forward by Fred Lebow (race director of the NYC Marathon), the coverage of each marathon is not necessarily from the elite perspective, but rather a bit from a mid-packers.  How exactly a mid-packer is defined is up to interpretation, but the focus of this book is not for a Bill Rodgers (though he did blurb the book), or, to use a more modern example, a Deana Kastor or Paula Radcliffe.<br /><br />\\"The World of Marathons\\" gives a moderately detailed description of worldwide marathons.  Each marathon gets its own small chapter, which includes a couple of color photographs, a course map, and race details, as well as text which covers a little bit of the race history and what the particular marathon is like.  The text covers details such as crowd support, things eccentric to that marathon (free beer at one), and attempts to give a sense of the marathon.  Some marathons included are: NYC, Chicago, London, Paris, Venice, Moscow, and others (including an African marathon, I believe).  In general, this book only covers the big, major marathons in various countries and while some of the marathons may be rather small they are important for the country and gives a sense of how other parts of the world are trying to organize a marathon.<br /><br />The primary drawback to this book is simply its age.  Published in 1987, much of the information is out of date.  If I was planning a trip to a foreign marathon right now, I could not trust the information included in this book.  What is the Stockholm Marathon isn't run anymore?  What if the organization is now poor, or that the field has shrunk by several thousand?  The book just feels very dated.<br /><br />On one hand this is a fairly interesting book and it gives a nice overview of some marathons across the world as well as some inside America, but on the other hand the book tries to give the impression that it is topical and has up to date information.  At one point it did, but it has been nearly twenty years since publication.  An American marathon hopeful will also not likely find this book very helpful because the focus is mostly on foreign marathons.<br /><br />I can't really recommend this book because while it does give a nice overview of worldwide marathons, the information is twenty years old and many things about any one (or more) of the marathons may have changed and some may even no longer be running.  It is a coffee table sized book and in that respect the book is okay.

Simmons picks up the various plot threads that he weaved together in \\"Ilium\\" and once again pushes them apart in vastly different directions.  At the start of the novel we know that the story takes place thousands of years in the future where evolved humans, or \\"post-humans\\", have left Earth and set themselves up as Greek Gods on Mars.  Mars has been terra-formed to reflect the climate and topography of ancient Greece where the Trojan Wars have been taking place with, for a time, an almost perfect match of Homer's \\"Iliad\\".  Back on Earth the \\"old style humans\\" were discovering who they are and a few have learned that they are about to begin a fight for their very survival.  Meanwhile, there are moravecs (robots with a human core) traveling the galaxy to Mars to find out what is going on with the planet.  This brings us to the start of \\"Olympos\\" where a Thomas Hockenberry, a scholar from the 20th Century has been recreated as an observer to the new Trojan Wars has managed to alter the course of history and the future.  Now the gods war amongst themselves.<br /><br />The story of Olympos is three-fold (at least), but when you boil the plot elements to their most basic form, each storyline is essentially the same.  The moravecs are striving to stop the universe from unraveling because of all of the messing with quantum technology to terraform Mars and to make the post-humans into gods.  The old-style humans are fighting for their own survival against a race of monsters which have awaken from their slumber.  Hockenberry is trying to save the Greeks (the new, old greeks) and himself while helping the moravecs.  Achilles is trying to save his love and return her to life.  Essentially, everyone is trying to save something and even though the paths split once again in \\"Olympos\\", Dan Simmons manages to tie them all together again in the end.<br /><br />If the brief description here of the plot is confusing, it should be.  \\"Ilium\\" almost absolutely has to have been read first for \\"Olympos\\" to make any kind of sense.  Even with \\"Ilium\\" read, \\"Olympos\\" is a fairly confusing novel.  Simmons takes the story to very unexpected places and at times I think that Simmons might be reaching a little too far.  He has very interesting ideas about alternative universes, history, and he has created very real characters to inhabit this world (or series of worlds).  But there are some pretty wild jumps that Simmons makes here, and at times it is difficult to follow all of the jumps and accept them.  My only actual complaint, however, is that the ending felt rushed.  Imagine that, after 1200 pages and two books the ending felt rush.  \\"Olympos\\" was build, build, build and then \\"oh yeah, we're done, wrap everything up!\\".<br /><br />The complaint about the ending is very minor, however.  What matters is the journey.  What matters is that for nearly 700 pages of \\"Olympos\\" I was completely wrapped up in the story and Simmons did a masterful job describing the action and the history and how things connect.  Granted, I feel Simmons did a better job of this with \\"Ilium\\", but there was no feeling at all of a let-down except for the ending and the rest of the book was so good that it overshadowed the ending.<br /><br />Reading \\"Ilium\\" and \\"Olympos\\" is a serious time investment, but for a speculative fiction or fantasy reader, it is one well worth making.  These books could use a prequel or a sequel, however, because there are a lot of questions that Simmons did not really explore.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryion here of the plot is confusing, it should be.  \\"Ilium\\" almost absolutely has to have been read first for \\"Olympos\\" to make any kind of sense.

The \\"Killik Twilight\\" was assumed destroyed with Alderaan but it has reappeared on a black market auction on Tatooine.  Han and Leia travel with Chewbacca and C-3PO to Tatooine to recover the painting and the code.<br /><br />The quest to reclaim the painting is the shell of the novel, but the real heart of the novel is the echoes of Shmi Skywalker and Leia beginning to learn about her grandmother and more about her father, Anakin.  Leia naturally has nothing but disgust and revulsion for the man she knew as Darth Vader, but the residents of Tatooine remember a friendly, pleasant young boy who won a Pod Race that humans shouldn't even be able to compete in.  Leia finds it nearly impossible to reconcile that Darth Vader was once a nice boy and not a boy who tortured lizards or something twisted.  That sense of discovery for Leia about Shmi and Anakin is where the heart lies in \\"Tatooine Ghost\\".  The painting really is secondary.<br /><br />This is a decent Star Wars book and far better than the below average books (there seems to be a real gap in quality in the series), but because the story here is so unnecessary there does not seem to be anything driving the story and making it seem important.  The discoveries by Leia are very interesting and worth reading for the Star Wars fan, but this is not a book I would start somebody out on who wanted to read Star Wars.  \\"Tatooine Ghost\\" is a book that fills in the gaps of the storyline and fleshes things out just a little bit more.  It's no more than that, but Troy Denning does a good job at what it is he seems to be trying to do.<br /><br />There is fun action and adventure and Denning does an excellent job describing travel across the desert of Tatooine.  This book is sure to appeal to the Star Wars fan and is quick enough to read that it will be an enjoyable time spent with Han and Leia, but this is also not a book which drives the series forward.<br /><br />-Joe Sherrythat fills in the gaps of the storyline and fleshes things out just a little bit more.

US	52402330	R1BP2OFNLRBSUZ	1844429415	329314086	The Looniness of the Long Distance Runner	Books	3	2	3	N	N	sometimes funny, but overall not terribly interesting	After agreeing to sponsor a friend of his for the NYC Marathon, Russell Taylor decides that he would like to run that marathon the following year.  Taylor is nearly 40 years old and is not a runner.  \\"The Looniness of the Long Distance Runner\\" is Taylor's account of training for the NYC Marathon.  The subtitle for this book covers exactly how crazy he is: \\"an unfit Londoner's attempt to run the New York City Marathon from scratch\\".<br /><br />Russell Taylor is, apparently a humor writer, and so this book is filled with humorous observations on running, training, races, and why exactly he is doing this.  Some of it is actually quite funny and I honestly found myself chuckling out loud a couple of times.  Unfortunately, when I wasn't chuckling I was reading and hoping that something interesting would be on the next page.  Often enough there wasn't.  As a runner I am drawn to books about running and about marathons so I figured this book would be a natural fit, but it was a struggle to get through this one.  Taylor includes a section of his training diary and that section was the single least interesting part of the book.  It just dragged on and on and on.  Sort of like this review.<br /><br />Then Taylor gets to the races.  As a part of his training Taylor ran several races and his racecourse descriptions and his feelings during the race (he made some interesting decisions as to which ones to run) were fascinating and funny.  Once again I started enjoying parts of the book.  The marathon itself seemed a little skimpy in the description.<br /><br />I just can't recommend \\"The Looniness of the Long Distance Runner\\" to anyone.  There are far better books about one man's journey to race (try \\"To the Edge\\" by Kirk Johnson for a more interesting book about an ultramarathon), and unfortunately when the humor stops there isn't much here to hold my interest.  Pass on this one.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry	2005-07-29
US	52402330	R1HVUC3DK6Q34E	0553569376	28503180	The Courtship of Princess Leia (Star Wars)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	a standard adventure story for Star Wars, but not bad	\\"The Courtship of Princess Leia\\" holds an interesting place in the Star Wars timeline.  Chronologically it fits after the conclusion of the Wraith Squadron trilogy and is shortly before the Timothy Zahn's Thrawn trilogy.  But it was written after the Thrawn novels and before the X-Wing series.  The trouble that this presents is that \\"The Courtship of  Princess Leia\\" concludes the Zsinj storyline that Aaron Allston worked on with the Wraith books and it is obvious that Dave Wolverton didn't have nearly as much interest in Zsinj as a villain as Allston later would.  Reading the series chronologically as I am can be an exercise in frustration when something like this occurs.  But because we know from books written before this volume and it would make no sense to do otherwise, we know from the start that Han Solo and Princess Leia are going to get married.  What we don't know is exactly how.  The road is rockier than we imagined at the end of \\"Return of the Jedi\\".<br /><br />Luke Skywalker is searching the galaxy for any information regarding the old Jedi Order.  To rebuild the Jedi and to further his own learning, he needs to know what the Jedi knew.  Thus far his search has not been successful until he stumbles across an old recording of Yoda's from three hundred years past.  The recording mentions trying to recover something from the planet Dathomir, but being \\"repulsed by the witches\\".<br /><br />Han Solo is just returning from the events of \\"Solo Command\\" and hunting the Warlord Zsinj and wants nothing more than to relax with Leia for a time.  But an envoy from the Hapan system is also there brokering a treaty, and Hapan joining the New Republic would be monumentally huge.  But part of the deal is that Leia must marry Isolder, the heir to Hapan.  With the size of the treaty and how important this would be, Leia seriously considers the offer, but while she does so, Han kidnaps her and takes her away to the planet which he has won in a game of Sabacc (sort of like how he won his ship all those years ago).  The planet is Dathomir.<br /><br />This brings Han, Leia, Luke, Artoo, and Threepio together and begins the adventure.<br /><br />Overall, this was a surprisingly interesting Star Wars tale.  I was most interested in Luke's search for anything of the Jedi and how he has progressed from when we last saw him in the movies.  The Leia and Han storyline worked, but because we know exactly how it is going to end (though we don't know how we get there), there is very little tension in whether or not Han and Leia will stay together and marry.  The forced exploration of Dathomir feels like a classic (old time) pulp fantasy novel, which is perfect for Star Wars.  This is just an adventure story with very little in the way of politics and lore.  It works, but after finishing the book I didn't feel like I was left with anything substantial.<br /><br />This book is, however, far better than Kathy Tyers' \\"The Truce at Bakura\\" but doesn't match up against the work of Matthew Stover (\\"Shatterpoint\\", \\"Revenge of the Sith\\") or Karen Traviss (\\"Republic Commando: Hard Contact\\").  This is a fairly basic, simple novel and sometimes that is nice.  It was even better than I hoped it would be, but then I had very low expectations going in.  My biggest disappointment was how the Zsinj situation was  handled and resolved.  After Allston's X-Wing books I expected something more, something bigger and more important.  But then I have to remind myself that this book came before the X-Wing novels.<br /><br />The bottom line is that if you are looking for a light Star Wars novel to read, you could do far worse than this one.  But please do not assume that this is the level of quality that can be expected from Star Wars novels.  Many are much better.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryike how he won his ship all those years ago).

US	52402330	R1YU64WFAZLJPL	0765348780	599137545	Gardens of the Moon (The Malazan Book of the Fallen, Book 1)	Books	5	3	5	N	N	a daunting, but excellent beginning to the series	\\"Gardens of the Moon\\" is the first book in a proposed ten volume series titled \\"The Malazan Book of the Fallen\\".  To call this an epic fantasy would not do justice to the potential scope of this book and series.  Steven Erikson has most often been compared to George R.R. Martin (\\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\") and for good reason.  Erikson is writing a long running series set in a medieval styled realm with a good deal of political talk mixed heavily with battle.  The tone of the book is very dark and gritty, despite characters displaying good humor.  This first volume is a bit daunting to begin because Erikson dumps the reader into the intrigue of his world with very little warning or exposition.  What we know from the start is that there is a woman seeking to overthrow the Emperor of the Malazan Empire, many underhanded dealings regarding the missions given the mage soldiers, a young boy named Ganoes Paran who wants to be a soldier, and a hardened veteran who is angering this woman who is already claiming to be Empress.  But this is just the exposition given in a short prologue.  The meat of the novel begins several years later.<br /><br />Several years later Paran is a captain in the Malazan Army.  He is assigned to lead the legendary Bridgeburners.  The Bridgeburners are being sent on every nasty mission the Empress Laseen can come up with, mostly in the hopes of the Bridgeburners being destroyed by attrition.  Her problem with the Bridgeburners is that they are a reminder of the deposed Emperor and of the old battlefield glories of Malazan.  They are a beacon to any who may consider revolt against the Empress.  But Laseen's reach and ambition is far beyond getting rid of the Bridgeburners.  She has turned her eyes to the city of Darujhistan.  Darujhistan is one of the largest cities in the world, but while Laseen has turned her eyes to that city Malazan also faces a threat from a non-human race called the Tiste Andii and their magic.  There is also another sub-plot regarding a young girl who has her soul taken and been turned into a ruthless killer, and another storyline featuring several different characters in Darujhistan.<br /><br />Confused yet?  This is only the tip of the iceberg, but to go into greater detail may spoil some of the surprises found in \\"Gardens of the Moon\\". It is also a book that is very difficult to adequately describe in a relatively short space.  The viewpoint that Erikson gives the reader is that of the common soldiers and mages and peasants.  We seldom get to see things through the eyes of those who hold real power.  Laseen is never given a viewpoint, nor are the nobles or many commanding officers of any real rank.  But this is where the sense of discovery comes in.  As far as I can tell, Steven Erikson has built up a very rich world but he only gives us bits and pieces of what is really going on.  With each character and with each chapter we get a little bit more of the overall story and more often than not what we think is going on is only a small piece of the whole, and since this is Book One, what we learn by the end is still only a small piece of an even greater whole.<br /><br />While some time is spent trying to figure out who these characters are and how they relate to each other and the world, this is fascinating fantasy novel and one of the best opening novels to a series in some time.  It compares well to \\"A Game of Thrones\\" except that it is a bit more confusing from the start.  I understand that this series starts to come together a bit more in the next two books, and that may be a high price to pay for some readers who want to fully understand what is going on early, but I feel that the time invested in reading this book (and ultimately the series) is going to be worth it.  Because the US publishing of this series is behind that of the UK, we are only just getting Book 4 where the UK is already on 6 and waiting for 7 (maybe 8), which means that we can expect to see each subsequent volumein a reasonable amount of time (unlike George Martin).<br /><br />The bottom line for this book is that it is well worth the time spent reading it and it marks the beginning of what may be one of the best fantasy series ever written.  I have read elsewhere that each subsequent book is better than the one before it.  If that is the case, and this book is already quite good, it bodes well for the future of this series.  While a 10 Book series may seem daunting, know that Erikson is almost done and he has a specific plan on how to finish it and seems to be churning out high quality books at a fairly good clip.  If you like the fantasy of George Martin then this is certainly one to check out.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryquent volume in a reasonable amount of time (unlike George Martin).   <br /> <br />The bottom line for this book is that it is well worth the time spent reading it and it marks the beginning of what may be one of the best fantasy series ever written.

US	52402330	R2GB0TFAOLSK0Z	1592400639	51229661	This Man's Army: A Soldier's Story from the Frontlines of the War on Terrorism	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Captain Exum's experience as a soldier	Andrew Exum enlisted in the Army thinking that military service would be a good way to pay for his education at the University of Pennsylvania as well as serve his country in peacetime.  He thought that he would likely serve in peacekeeping duties in Europe or perhaps Africa, but not actually see combat.  There was value, in his mind, of Army service even in the peacetime.  He had enlisted in the Army ROTC as a student and became an officer in 2000.  September 11 changed the nature of what his service would be.<br /><br />\\"This Man's Army\\" is Captain Exum's story of his time as a soldier.  He details his reasons for enlisting, what sort of upbringing he had, and what his experience was in training and on the battlefield.  Exum offers a fresh perspective of the life of an Army officer.  While books like Anthony Swofford's \\"Jarhead\\" and Joel Turnipseed's \\"Baghdad Express\\" offer accounts of the modern day disillusioned soldier (both about Gulf War I), Captain Exum is a motivated leader of men who takes pride in his work, his platoon, and his Army.  He does not blindly accept political rhetoric, and unlike many military men Exum is far from being a staunch Republican.  He struggles to fit what he must do as a soldier with his beliefs as a Christian, but accepts that there are times that fighting for the greater good can supercede personal belief.<br /><br />Readers looking for a book filled with combat and blazing guns should look someplace else (perhaps Evan Wright's excellent \\"Generation Kill\\").  \\"This Man's Army\\" is the experience of Captain Andrew Exum, and while the nature of his service did include quite a bit of risk, stress, being shot at, and completing valuable missions in Afghanistan; there are not many gun battles or what would traditionally be thought of as \\"battlefield combat\\".  Yet, \\"This Man's Army\\" is compulsively readable and was a book I did not want to put down.  Exum's descriptions of his training, going through Ranger school, and his style (and experiences) of leadership is fascinating.  While I am glad that Exum is out of harm's way now, I wish he was still able to serve in the Army because our military and our country needs more men of his character and apparent ability.  He is the sort of man I want protecting our country.<br /><br />Captain Exum also gives an excellent description of how a soldier comes home and tries to adapt to a life where he does not have a rifle in his hand.  How he has to adapt to paying for things again, fight the feeling that he is \\"entitled\\" to things because of his service, and just become a civilian again.<br /><br />Something else that I found very interesting was that if he wasn't injured (outside of combat), Exum would have been part of the mission which rescued Private Jessica Lynch.  Having to watch that on television was a very difficult thing for Captain Exum, not the least of which because he was still in uniform.<br /><br />Overall I found \\"This Man's Army\\" to be an excellent account of Andrew Exum's time in the military and what one possible experience of a modern day soldier is.  It isn't exactly what one might consider a traditional war memoir, but this is also a different kind of war.  I would recommend this book without hesitation, just with the understanding that there is a very small amount of actual combat or field action.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry(and experiences) of leadership is fascinating.

In theory, the type of world Stross created would allow for as many volumes as the author can think up stories.  There will definitely be a sequel, \\"The Hidden Family\\", and the structure of this first book is such that it feels like the beginning of a trilogy.<br /><br />Miriam Beckstein is an investigative reporter for a technology magazine in Boston.  When Paulette, a co-worker and researcher at the magazine brings Miriam an exhaustive stack of research on a story Miriam is working on, what they discover is strong evidence of corruption and money laundering.  Bringing it to her editor, Miriam is promptly fired and soon receives death threats.  Paulette, for being involved is also fired.  The cause has nothing to do with the offense except that the company that owns the building the magazine works in (and possibly the magazine) may be implicated.  Miriam goes to her adoptive mother to tell her about  being fired and her mother says it is time Miriam knew a little bit more of how she ended up in the care of the family she did.  She also gives Miriam a shoe box containing some of her true mother's belongings.<br /><br />When Miriam gets home she opens the box and discovers a locket.  The locket has a strange pattern and when she focuses on the pattern she finds herself in the middle of a forest with no sign of civilization except for a horseman riding towards her holding a machine gun.  She focuses back on the locket and returns home.  This is the true beginning to the story.  As an investigative reporter, Miriam needs to figure this out, to find out what happened or if she is simply going crazy.  While going crazy might work for a short story, it would be a pretty poor opening for a fantasy novel if the fantasy world isn't real.  It is, of course, and she begins to investigate what this medieval styled world is like and what is all about.  She soon learns that she is part of the aristocracy there, but that things are darker and more dangerous than what she expected.<br /><br />As a long time fantasy reader I think the idea behind this book is fascinating.  I want to know how these worlds are connected, why, who and how this was discovered.  I want to see further interaction between the worlds as Miriam discovers how this works and what her place is in either world.  I even want to know what happens in the next book.  I just want someone else to write it.<br /><br />See, \\"The Family Trade\\" is a very interesting concept and Miriam Beckstein is a smart woman who behaves in a much more realistic way than most fantasy characters who get plopped into a strange new world.  Most behave as if they know everything or as if they can know nothing.  Miriam seems to learn and it makes sense how she figures things out, even if there may be jumps in logic which don't work for me but might work for a reporter.  The problem is the writing, especially early on, is just cheap and weak.  Here's an example of page four of the paperback and where I almost gave up:<br /><br /> \\"Back upstairs, fortified by an unfeasibly large mug of coffee, she had to work out what to wear.  She dived into her closet and found herself using her teeth to tear the plastic bag off one of the three suits she'd had dry cleaned  on Friday --only to discover it was her black formal interview affair, not at all the right thing for a rainy Monday pounding the street--or at least doing telephone interviews from a cubicle in the office\\"<br /><br />Bear in mind this is just after Miriam fled downstairs and switched on the coffee percolator.  The beginning of the book was all like this and while it did get somewhat better, this was still the same tone that was used throughout the book and it simply downgraded what is, at heart, an interesting story.<br /><br />In the hands of another authorI am sure I would have loved this book and would be excited to read the second volume.  As it stands, I didn't and I'm not.  I am interested enough in the core story that I'm actually considering it, but I can only hope that the writing style improves somewhat.<br /><br />The bottom line is that as a first book in a series, this is not a complete story.  The pace is fast enough that this is a book that will be finished fairly quickly and the idea is interesting enough that I still do want to know what happens next.  The way Stross phrases sentences, ideas, and paragraphs just leaves a little to be desired.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryds of another author I am sure I would have loved this book and would be excited to read the second volume.

To give a quick refresher, Wraith Squadron was formed because Wedge's Rogue Squadron was so well known as being the best that anytime the Rogues were dispatched on a mission any chance of covertness was eliminated.  While the Rogues were the best of the best, a Star Wars Top Gun squadron, the Wraiths were chosen from the dregs of the New Republic.  These are the pilots who, for one reason or another, were going to wash out.  This isn't to say that these pilots can't fly an X-Wing, because they can, but rather it was often behavioral issues that caused the problem.  But Wedge didn't form the Wraiths to be an elite unit like Rogue Squadron.  Wraith Squadron is to be a unit designed to get the pilots in close and do insurgency missions, often on the ground.  The primary mission of the Wraiths has been against the Warlord Zsinj, a former Imperial turned criminal who is the largest threat to both the New Republic and the  vestiges of the Empire.<br /><br />Finally the New Republic and the Wraiths will be going after Zsinj directly.  The plan is to attempt to lure Zsinj into a battle where his flagship, the Iron Fist, can be captured or destroyed.  To do this, the Wraiths are using Han Solo and the Millennium Falcon as bait...or a decoy of the Falcon.  The Wraiths, the Republic, and even an officer in the Empire are working together to attack the businesses of Zsinj so that he will be forced into combat.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Zsinj is working against the New Republic by activating a project of his to install fear and distrust between humans and non-humans in the Republic, and it was this original mixing of the races that proved so strong for the New Republic in light of the anti-alien stance of the Empire.  But now this is being threatened and the Council of the New Republic has no evidence that the events are anything other than attacks by the individual races.<br /><br />\\"Solo Command\\" is quite possibly the best of the three Wraith novels and is as good as some of the Rogue books.  It still features a rather large amount of humor and jokes and pranks with the Wraith pilots, but features a faster moving plot that actually seems to be going somewhere.  The previous two Wraith books didn't really seem to advance any sort of storyline.  Something else that I liked here was that the Rogue Squadron was included on the main mission here, so there was intermingling between the two X-Wing squadrons that Wedge commands.  Han Solo also makes a guest starring appearance here and it was nice to see how he fits into all of this (thus far in the chronology he hasn't had a lot to do, though I know he's been busy and will get a larger role in future novels).<br /><br />All told this was a satisfying conclusion to the Wraith trilogy and it leads into the storyline of \\"The Courtship of Princess Leia\\".  \\"Solo Command\\" features excellent action scenes and space battle sequences with the X-Wings.

Moran's story, unfortunately, is one of the weakest in the collection.<br /><br />This is a mixed bag of stories where some of them are rather good, Zahn's in particular as well as the Moisture Farmer's Tale by M. Shayne Bell.  Others, unfortunately are not so good.  Moran's story is probably the worst here.  The main attraction of a collection like this is also its greatest downfall: the stories that are being told are those of characters we would never get a chance to see.  It is great to find out who the bartender is and what his story is, and what about that little Jawa in the corner?  Everybody in the Cantina has a story to tell  The downside is that some of the stories just aren't that interesting and besides, this isn't the main story of Star Wars.  Luke Skywalker barely shows up and only to center the story in time so we know when things are taking place.  We see Kenobi save Luke in the Cantina time and time again and at times I felt that I honestly didn't care who this creature was.<br /><br />For the person who just has to read every Star Wars book, don't go in with any real expectations.

US	52402330	RLRKYFIED39CP	0765311771	508215649	Elantris	Books	5	215	236	N	N	a one volume fantasy?  Yep, and it's great!	\\"Elantris\\" is the debut novel from Brandon Sanderson.  Blurbs on the cover from Orson Scott Card and David Farland say this book is \\"the finest novel of fantasy to be written in many years\\" and \\"one of the finest debuts I've seen in years.\\"  When I read a novel I generally do not pay attention to when it was written and I know that I haven't read all of the debut fantasy novels which have come out in the past several years.  I do know when I've read a very good book, however, and \\"Elantris\\" is certainly that.<br /><br />The prologue to the novel was all of five paragraphs but it gave all of the information needed to understand the background of what the story would be.  It tells of a beautiful city named Elantris which glowed like magic and where amazing magics were possible and commonplace.  Elantris was populated by godlike beings who could wield these powers as I might use a pen.  But these beings were once regular humans, soldiers and serfs, princes and beggers and merchants.  When something called the Shaod came upon them they were transformed into Elantrians and into a newer, greater existence.  But ten years ago something happened.<br /><br />That something is that the blessing turned into a curse and Elantris and its population started to rot away.  The city now abandoned except for the poor souls still called by the Shaod is covered in slime and muck and the Elantrians are the cursed, neither dead nor truly alive.<br /><br />This was a beautiful set up and pulled me right in from the start.  Sanderson introduces Raoden, a prince and heir to the throne of Arelon.  The city of Kae lies in the shadow of Elantris and the glory of Arelon has fallen with Elantris.  Raoden is a man who gives his people hope, but when he is called by the Shaod he is doomed.  His father, the king, does not reveal what happened to Raoden, but rather holds a funeral for his not beloved son.  Meanwhile, Sarene, a princess from another country has arrived to marry Raoden not knowing what has happened.  Her marriage contract considers her married upon the betrothal and even continues after Raoden's death, so she remains in Kae.  But Raoden must find a way to survive, such as it is, in Elantris.  Sarene is the only one who sees the coming doom from the religion of Darethi and an invasion from Fjordell.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson has done something remarkable here.  He has created an incredibly original work and unlike so many other works of fantasy this novel is complete in itself.  It is not, as I understand it, the first volume of a trilogy or larger series.  It is an epic work of fantasy in one self contained novel.  It's one of the better fantasies that I have read.  Sanderson does a good job in making all of the primary characters understandable, and sympathetic...even the \\"bad guys\\".  The motivations are explained well and the characters are well developed and revealed.  Simply put, with one novel Sanderson has made a fan of me.  I was surprised by just how good this book was.  If Sanderson writes another, I will definitely read it.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryknowing what has happened.

The original premise of the series takes a Roman Legion and magically transported the Legion, plus a Celt, into a completely alien world and into the Empire of Videssos.  While the world is populated by humans, it is also a world in which magic truly works.  This third book has taken the leader of the Legion, Marcus Scaurus and into the employ of the Empire as a mercenary captain.  His legionnaires are accepted as some of the finest warriors around and the Roman tactics are new to Videssos.  After installing Thorisin Gavras on the throne of Videssos at the end of \\"An Emperor for the Legion\\", and spending a winter sorting out the Empire's tax laws, Marcus Scaurus is sent back out into the field.<br /><br />The Count Drax was once a mercenary leader just like Marcus, but when Drax found himself on the edge of the Empire having won battles for Videssos, Drax found himself in command of a goodly large chunk of the Empire.  Rather than hold his position as a captain, Drax founded his own kingdom.  Marcus and the Legion is on the march to capture Drax and reclaim that land for Videssos.  Meanwhile, the Celt Viridovix the Celt and Gorgidas the Greek physician have left Marcus' service and are now on their own finding a new way on this strange planet.  While Marcus is focused on Drax, he knows and Thorisin Gavras knows that their true enemy is the wizard Avshar, evil leader of a band of Yezda nomads.<br /><br />For those readers who know of the history of the Byzantium Empire, the Videssos Cycle echoes some (or much) of that history.  Videssos, I understand, is this world's Byzantium.  Readers with this sort of background will likely get a much deeper reading of this series.  I do not know how much actual history fits in with these fictional stories or what that history may be, so I can only enjoy the books on its own terms as it tells a story.  Out of the first three books of the Videssos Cycle, \\"The Legion of Videssos\\" is the best.  It focuses more on Marcus than on the overall Legion, which is a strength.  It also alternates sections and sometimes chapters between Marcus, Viridovis, and Gorgidas.  The characterization of these men are much stronger here than in the first two books.  While it would help to have read books one and two, I do recommend this book (and series) to any who find the idea of this book interesting.  I have found that it is worth the time to make it this far in the series and \\"The Legion of Videssos\\" has left me more satisfied than the other two books.<br /><br />-Joe Sherrys Cycle, \\"The Legion of Videssos\\" is the best.

It is set in the same world as her previous trilogy: The Farseer, but deals with another aspect of the world and this first book, at least, is almost completely separate with only occasional mentions of a \\"war up north\\" which was a major plot point of the Farseer.  \\"Ship of Magic\\", unlike the Farseer, is told in the third person point of view rather than the first person of FizChivalry (The Farseer Trilogy).  The focus here is on multiple characters and multiple storylines which are initially separate but start to slowly come together.<br /><br />Althea Vestrit is the daughter of Captain Vestrit, owner of the Liveship Vivacia.  A Liveship is not merely made of wood and sailed by the talent of the crew, but it is a ship that is actually alive, it has personality and can think and is so prized that Trader families would put their families generations into debt because of how valued and important these ships are to Bingtown and to the Traders.  The Liveships are faster and sail better than any other ship on the water.  When  her father dies, and he is near death, Althea expects to inherit Vivacia and eventually learn to be her captain.  But when he does die the ship is left to the husband of her sister, and Kyle Haven thinks Althea is no proper lady and has no place on a ship.  After a very big argument and fight with her family, and with Kyle, Althea leaves Bingtown with the intent to eventually working her way back to be able to own Vivacia in her own right.<br /><br />There is also a pirate captain, Kennit, who seeks to be ruler of the pirates and also to capture a liveship of his own.  At least a third of \\"Ship of Magic\\" is about Kennit and his adventures and piracy and his dreams of a better, different life.  The final third of the book is focuses on Kyle Haven's son, Wintrow.  Wintrow is Kyle's only son, but was promised to be a priest of Sa.  But when Kyle finally gains control of Vivacia, he also commands Wintrow to join him as a sailor with the intent the Wintrow become a man and eventually take over Vivacia.  But Wintrow is not the son that Kyle wants him to be, nor is he the man that Kyle considers a man.<br /><br />\\"Ship of Magic\\" is a slow moving novel with more focus on the characters and their development than about swiftly moving a plot along.  By the end of this novel there is quite a bit of plot development, but with the pacing and the characterization it is almost a wonder that Hobb moved the story along at all.  It is almost as if the reader were a ship floating along in the ocean of the novel.  But while the pacing may be an issue for some readers, if the reader is familiar with her earlier work, this will not be a surprise and Robin Hobb does such a good job of slowly pulling the reader into her world that by the end we are looking for the next book in the series.<br /><br />Since this book is not directly related to the Farseer Trilogy there is no problem with reading this book first, but I do recommend reading the books in publication order (starting with Assassin's Apprentice).  Either way, this is a different sort of a fantasy novel, but one which I find to be a treat.

As can be gleamed from the title, all of the stories are set in the palace of Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine.  The timeline we are looking at is near the beginning of \\"The Return of the Jedi\\" where Luke Skywalker tries to bargain with Jabba for the release of Han Solo and Leia, in the end, kills Jabba.  But the main heroes of the Star Wars Universe are only on the periphery here.  There are 19 separate tales here and each one of them deals with a minor character who was at Jabba's Palace at that fateful time.  The character profiled range from Boba Fett to Bib Fortuna (Jabba's Majordomo) to that creepy laughing little creature Salacious Crumb to the trainer of the Ranco to Mara Jade (she will become important later in the series) to Jabba's chef.  The dancer Oola gets a tale, as does the band.  So, as you can see this is fairly complete collection of stories.<br /><br />Various science fiction and fantasy authors have contributed stories to the collection.  Many are Star Wars veterans including A.C. Crispin, Kevin Anderson, Kathy Tyers, Timothy Zahn, Barbara Hambly, and Dave Wolverton.  Another, Jennifer Roberson (Chronicles of the Cheysuli) is one I am familiar with from her other works (as I am with Hambly).  For the Star Wars fan, this is a talented gathering of authors.<br /><br />Some of the tales are quite good and are very interesting such as Zahn's tale of Mara  Jade and Crispin's story of the \\"fat dancer\\".  But overall the collection is forgettable and it is only those of the characters I most recognize (Fett, Mara Jade, the band) that I really remember only several days after finishing the book.  The paperback is a good sized 427 pages, and I imagine it is essential reading for the Star Wars fan looking to devour every book in the Extended Universe, but nothing is missed if this book isn't read.  The story of Fett's escape from the Sarlacc is probably the only thing that has true value (especially since K.W. Jeter's trilogy on Fett is so bad).  I'll recommend the reader pass on this collection, or perhaps only read a couple of the stories before returning it to the library.<br /><br />-Joe Sherrythat has true value (especially since K.W.

The first story in this collection, \\"Guts\\" was incredibly gross, but it had this potential for goriness and nastiness and creepiness that I had expected the rest of the stories to live up to and perhaps surpass. I expected something grand and fantastic and while there was a sense of the fantastic, it didn't live up to the hype in my mind. Not after \\"Guts\\" and not after books like Survivor or Diary.<br /><br />The basic structure of the book is that a group of writers sign up for a three month escape from reality so that they can write their \\"masterpieces\\" with no contact with the outside world. They are locked into a theatre and right away they start getting edgy and uncomfortable with the lack of possibility of leaving. They start telling each other stories, possibly fiction but the stories get tied into their personas. Each of these stories is the short stories of Palahniuk, but the Writer's Conference is the framing device of the collection, sort of like The Canturbury Tales, only probably without the lasting acclaim.<br /><br />\\"Guts\\" was such an interesting lead off hit for \\"Haunted\\" that most of the rest of the stories felt lacking. The framing device of the conference was a little absurd in the lengths that the people went to build their masterpieces and insure their fame.<br /><br />I really like Chuck Palahniuk's work, but \\"Haunted\\" was a let down.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry	2005-05-20
US	52402330	RA29TRU8SYB4R	1585422789	302664021	Ultramarathon Man: Confessions of an All-Night Runner	Books	4	6	7	N	N	it boggles the mind	Dean Karnazes is an amazing athlete.  He is a winner of the 2004 Badwater 135 Ultramarathon (The World's Toughest Footrace, 135 miles through Death Valley), and has completed the Western States 100 Mile Endurance Run as well as running the first South Pole Marathon.  He has also run a 199 mile Relay event without having a relay team.  On his thirtieth birthday, having not run for fifteen years and feeling a bit of a mid-life crisis and dissatisfaction with his life, Dean went out for a run.  Most people, going out for their first run in more than a decade might go for a mile or two and get the old feeling back.  Dean ran thirty miles.  \\"Ultramarathon Man: Confessions of an All Night Runner\\" is Dean's autobiography.<br /><br />My interest in this book stems from an article I read about Dean Karnazes in Runner's World Magazine regarding his quest to run 300 miles in one incredibly long run.  At the time the article was written he had \\"only\\" run 262 consecutive miles.  He has since surpassed 300.  But that article peaked my interest in Karnazes.  His capacity for pain and endurance is incredible and at the time I knew next to nothing about the world of ultramarathons (any distance longer than a marathon) or ultra running.  I am interested in all things distance running and that interest served me well because this isn't an exceptionally well written book.  The sentences have a choppy flow to them and the writing is a little simplistic.  It is more like Karnazes is writing how he would talk, which works on one level but that doesn't always translate to good writing.<br /><br />But that didn't really matter to me because I was so interested in his running career and his accomplishments and the events that he has participated in.  To say that this book is short sighted and only focuses on Karnazes and not touching upon the history of the sport or other athletes kind of misses the point.  This is a book about, and written by, Dean Karnazes and his experience as an ultra runner.  Karnazes reveals how he has something of an obsessive compulsive personality and his outlet is running.  He just takes it to an extreme that most people wouldn't understand.  I certainly don't, though I'm impressed by it.<br /><br />This is a good book for those interested what Karnazes has done and in long distance running in general.  It is not well written enough that it would draw in somebody who didn't already have the interest.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryultra runner.

After being formed by Wedge Antilles in \\"Wraith Squadron\\", the Wraiths are out to eliminate one the biggest enemies of the new Republic: the Warlord Zsinj.  Unlike the legendary Rogue Squadron of the first four books, Wraith Squadron is more of a covert insurgent squadron than the elite pilots that comprise the Rogues.  The purpose of the Wraiths is completely different.<br /><br />To get close enough to Zsinj to destroy him, the Wraiths pose as a band of pirates looting and attacking former Empire outposts and installations.  They come to the attention of Zsinj and the Wraiths finally have their chance to take out Zsinj, but the risk is great.  Being identified as Republic will eliminate any chance of a covert action against Zsinj and the chance of all of the Wraiths being killed in action is great.  But the mission is more important than their lives.<br /><br />This book had a somewhat slow start, but Allston soon picked up the pace with well written space battles and a lot of humor.  The humor is something that sets this little series apart.  The Wraiths are almost constantly joking and pulling pranks on each other all the while working to complete their mission.  It really is a treat to read for the Star Wars fan.  The X-Wing books, \\"Iron Fist\\" included, seem to have a very good grasp of the heart of Star Wars.  It's fun.  These books would likely have made good movies  had George Lucas decided to take the series in this direction.  I scarcely need to recommend the sixth X-Wing book because anybody who has read this far certainly already enjoys the series.  But, if a reader is looking to get into the Star Wars novels, the X-Wing series is an excellent place to begin.

Feist introduced the idea of rifts between the worlds and the dangers that was inherent in these rifts.  He introduced, through the Riftwar trilogy, how the gods worked and who some other ancient, legendary beings were.  \\"Exile's Return\\" is the third book of Raymond Feist's latest trilogy \\"The Conclave of Shadows\\".  It is set some hundred years after the events of \\"Magician\\" and while there had been a drop in the quality in Feist's writing in recent years, this series and this volume in particular has been a return to form for Raymond Feist.<br /><br />\\"Exile's Return\\" begins immediately after the conclusion of \\"King of Foxes\\" with the former Duke of Olasko spared his life, but exiled to some unknown land on Midkemia.  Kaspar of Olasko was the primary villain of the previous two volumes: \\"Talon of the Silver Hawk\\" and \\"King of Foxes\\".  This book marks the first time in Feist's work that a villain would end up as the protagonist of a novel.  Kaspar, for those who may need a refresher, was the man who ordered the Orosoni tribe to be slaughtered (Tal Hawkins, the hero of the first two books was the surviving Orosoni), and attempting to instigate a war between the kingdoms of Roldem, Kesh, and the Kingdom of the Isles.  In short, he was a bad man.  But he was also a man who ended up being in the control of the evil magician Varen.  Varen had been an adversary of Pug's for years.<br /><br />With Kaspar exiled, his first need is to simply survive.  He doesn't speak the language nor does he initially know where he is.  He wishes to return to Olasko, reclaim his Duchy, and seek revenge against Tal Hawkins.  But as the days and weeks and months pass he has time to realize how much of a dupe he was of Varen and how many of his actions were actually not his own idea, though he thought they were at the time.  He is shamed, but wants to get home.  Feist gives the reader a realistic transformation of Kaspar all the while building the threat that is facing Midkemia.  In his attempt to return to his homeland, Kaspar discovers something which will threaten all life on Midkemia.  This is nothing new for readers of the series, but Feist is able to spin a good enough story that the constant threat doesn't ring false.  Feist also manages to raise the stakes enough that we can believe that the incredibly powerful Pug and his company of magicians are not able to simply wave their hands and make it go away.  This is essential, for as long as Pug is alive it is difficult to believe that any threat has any chance of succeeding.<br /><br />After a disappointing middling trilogy based on video games (the \\"Krondor\\" series), Feist has hit his stride with \\"The Conclave of Shadows\\" and is building a storyline which is actually going to move into this next trilogy \\"The Darkwar Saga\\".  \\"Exile's Return\\" is a very good Midkemia (or Riftwar) novel, and should be thoroughly enjoyed by any fan of Raymond Feist's work.  While I do recommend this book, I would also suggest that any new readers would at least start with \\"Talon of the Silver Hawk\\", if not \\"Magician: Apprentice\\" as an introduction to Feist's work.  There is simply a lot of story and background to get through.  But this book here features some of the better writing and characterization (of Kaspar anyway, the rest of the characters are given short shrift) that Feist has produced in recent memory.  It is enough to please most readers of this style of fantasy.  While \\"Exile's Return\\" works as a conclusion to a trilogy, it is also an introduction to a new story because it is very clear that this is only the beginning of something bigger.

I didn't know what to think when I first heard about \\"Ilium\\".  The way it was described to me was that \\"Ilium\\" is a science fiction telling of Homer's \\"The Iliad\\" and it had something to do with Mars.  That was really all I knew and to be honest, that description still doesn't do much for me.  That description is true, but it doesn't quite convey what \\"Ilium\\" is.  More than just giving the read \\"The Iliad\\" in space, Dan Simmons has created the first part of an epic masterpiece which is nothing like what I expected.  I don't use the word \\"masterpiece\\" lightly.<br /><br />\\"Ilium\\" tells three different stories that are at first completely unrelated.  The first is that of the Iliad.  The ancient Greeks are waging their epic war against the Trojans and this war was all started when Helen of Sparta left her husband Menelaus to join with Paris of Troy.  That was the face which launched a thousand ships.  Since we are talking about a Greek epic here, there are gods a plenty showing up and getting involved the war.  But \\"Ilium\\" isn't a simple retelling of Homer.  \\"Ilium\\" is something completely different.  Thomas Hockenberry is a late 20th Century/Early 21st Century scholar (here called a scholic) who has been revived thousands of years after his death to observe this Trojan War and see how closely the events match with Homer's \\"Iliad\\".<br /><br />I have to admit, that is quite an idea for a book.  But that is only a third of the story here.  Next we have a setting which is definitely on the planet Earth, our Earth, but is thousands and thousands and perhaps even thousands of years in the future.  Taking a cue from H.G. Wells' \\"The Time Machine\\" the remaining humans have such advanced technology and society that there is no work, no manual or physical labor.  Instead humans live only for their own personal pleasure.  Think of these humans as the Eloi from the mind of Wells.  But if there are eloi, there must also be morlocks.  Here the analogy breaks down a bit as the servants of these humans are robots.  Into the lives of Daeman, a human male, and Ada, a human woman comes Harman.  Harman is a man who is in the final year of his Final Twenty.  What this means is that he only has one year left to live before he is allowed to spent an eternity with the \\"Post Humans\\", a race of superhumans who created all of this technology and luxury but who have since left the planet.  Harman is eager to learn about the past and what the truth might be since nobody living has any idea of the past or can even read.<br /><br />The third part of the story of \\"Ilium\\" is completely different.  Still in some distant future and seemingly unconnected to the other two storylines (which are also seemingly unconnected), this storyline concerns a quartet (initially) of mechanical creatures called moravecs which are set on a mission to explore Mars and see why exactly the planet has been Terraformed to have an atmosphere and possibly some sort of life and dare I say civilization.  I call the moravecs a mechanical creature rather than robot because even though they are robotic, they seem to also require some sort of oxygen to function.  I can't explain it.  Have I mentioned that two of these moravecs also have a running conversation about the sonnets and Shakespeare and end up discussion Proust?<br /><br />Somehow, and I couldn't quite imagine how at first, Dan Simmons manages to tie all three storylines together in a way that feels far more natural than it possibly should.  Even more amazing, Simmons manages to make all of this interesting and intelligent.  In the hands of a lesser writer, this book would have been a big mess.  Then again, a lesser author might not have attempted this.  As Simmons reveals more and more of each storyline, it becomes more and more gripping.  This epic story is only the first part of a two book series.  The second book, \\"Olympos\\", will be published inthe summer of 2005.<br /><br />Describing \\"Ilium\\" is difficult because to go too far in depth with the various plot threads would likely take thousands of words.  Suffice it to say that after Simmons gives the reader an adequate introduction to each storyline, he takes it in a direction the reader will likely not expect.  That this sprawling, nearly 600 pages novel is very readable and accessible to even somebody who doesn't know a thing about the Iliad (me), \\"The Time Machine\\", or science fiction, is remarkable.  But \\"Ilium\\" succeeds at all of this and by the end of the book I was disappointed that \\"Olympos\\" wasn't already in stores or in my local library.<br /><br />-Joe Sherrye published in the summer of 2005.   <br /> <br />Describing \\"Ilium\\" is difficult because to go too far in depth with the various plot threads would likely take thousands of words.

US	52402330	R26X3EMML655V0	0345428838	547341365	Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith	Books	5	4	5	N	N	one of the most satisfying Star Wars books yet	Matthew Stover is the latest author (after Terry Brooks and R.A. Salvatore) to be given a chance to adapt one of the Star Wars films to a novel.  Stover is no novice to the Star Wars universe, having written the excellent prequel novel \\"Shatterpoint\\" and the New Jedi Order volume \\"Traitor\\".  Considering how dark and gritty \\"Shatterpoint\\" was, Stover appeared to be the perfect author to give the novelization for Episode Three to.  Episode Three was said to be the darkest of all 6 films, and Stover is good at going dark.  This was one of the few Star Wars novels which I was actually looking forward to reading.<br /><br />The basic outline of \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" has been known for years, even before \\"The Phantom Menace\\" was a glimmer in the eye of George Lucas.  This is the one fans have been waiting for.  This is the fall of Anakin Skywalker.  This is the film, the book where Anakin Skywalker is seduced by the Dark Side of the Force, turns his back on the Jedi, helps destroy the Jedi and becomes Darth Vader.  We know the history.  We know what the end result is, that Luke and Leia will end up being separated with no knowledge of each other or their father.  What we don't know is exactly how this all goes down.  When the first two prequel movies were not what the audience had expected, \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" had to contain all the fans had wanted for the prequel trilogy.  Since the release date for the movie is still a month away, I can't say if the movie will deliver the goods.  I can say that the book does.<br /><br />The Anakin Skywalker that we know from \\"Attack of the Clones\\" is more than a little brash and angry at times, but he is dedicated to the Jedi.  The other prequel novels give little foreshadowing hints to the fall, as does the scene in Episode Two where he slaughters the Tusken Raiders who kidnapped his mother.  But how does he fall from the Jedi to the Sith?  Matthew Stover does an excellent job at showing the reader the inner workings of Anakin's mind regarding the Jedi and how much of a friend Palpatine is to him, how important Palpatine is and how little Palpatine judges Anakin.  He is exceptionally close to Obi-Wan, but Anakin still feels judgment from the Jedi.  Through tightly described scenes of conversation and battle, we see Anakin slipping closer and closer to being able to accept the Dark Side.  We see Palpatine continue to manipulate Anakin so that when he finally does reveal himself Anakin doesn't see the monster, but his friend who also happens to be a Sith Lord and might the Sith really not be as evil as the Jedi have taught?<br /><br />I can only hope that George Lucas proves to be half as good of a director for this final Star Wars film that Matthew Stover is a writer.  If so, we can be looking at one very, very good movie.  I'm skeptical, of course.  Stover set the bar pretty high with this book.  Including this book I have read forty of the Star Wars novels and this is easily one of the best.  The story is gripping and one which I wanted to keep reading to find out exactly what happened next.  Stover is very good at describing the lightsaber battles as well as making the dialogue feel natural (something that we don't often get in Star Wars).  The only thing that felt off was the use of the trademark \\"I have a bad feeling about this\\" that must be contractually required of every Star Wars author.  If Stover is this good playing in somebody else's world, I can imagine how good his original work must be.  Not all Star Wars authors seem capable of writing this good of a Star Wars book.  One could even skip all of the other prequel novels that fill in the story and having seen the first two films just jump right into this book and read arguably the best Star Wars novel out there (Stover's \\"Shatterpoint\\" and Karen Traviss's \\"Republic Commando\\" must also be considered).

Jeter's \\"Hard Merchandise\\" is the concluding volume of the \\"Bounty Hunters Wars\\" trilogy.  This novel continues telling the story, the history of Boba Fett, the galaxy's most feared bounty hunter.  As in the first two books, \\"Hard Merchandise\\" begins with the dual tale of Boba Fett after the events of \\"The Return of the Jedi\\" which begins right where \\"Slave Ship\\" left off, and Boba Fett's actions between Episodes Five and Six and before he ends up at Jabba's palace where he will end up in the Sarlacc.  Having been forced to abandon his ship, Fett had taken control of the ship of one of his enemies, the bounty hunter Bossk.  Bossk hates Fett and intends on taking revenge on Fett for personal affronts as well as for being the pivot which brought down the Bounty Hunter's Guild.  Fett is, as always, closed mouth about his intentions, which is frustrating for his temporary partners.  In the storyline which is in the past, Fett is seeking to learn who is going to great lengths to set up a trap and kill him.<br /><br />But this book and this trilogy is not completely about Boba Fett.  There is a continuing storyline about the Kuat Drive Yards, the company which builds most of the ships of the Empire and potentially the Rebel Alliance if the Alliance could afford to pay.  There is internal intrigue on Kuat, and the leader of Kuat, Kuat of Kuat, is trying to keep his company out of the hands of those he deems untrustworthy.  That would be everyone.<br /><br />Honestly, while I have read all three Bounty Hunters books I still have no idea what the books were supposed to be about.  Sure there were additional details about Boba Fett's past revealed, but nothing was terribly important or revealing that would warrant one book, let alone three.  Other Star Wars books have been able to advance a storyline that ties into the galaxy we know from the movies as well as build upon the movies.  The X-Wing series is an excellent example of this.  This book, which really concludes nothing, and this series does none of this.  For such an intriguing character as Boba Fett, this was a very boring book and a dull trilogy.  I can see no reason to recommend these books to anyone.  Had I never read this book (and if you haven't made it through the first two, don't start here), I would have missed nothing in the Star Wars Universe.  I know exactly why people might be interested in these books: to have a trilogy based around Boba Fett.  This book (all three, really) is just not worth the time spent reading.

Patchett has also written the extraordinary \\"Bel Canto.\\"  This novel, originally published in 1992 was the announcement of a major new talent in literature.  The story she tells is a simple one, but filled with grace and written with skill.  In the 1960's, pregnant, Rose Clinton leaves her husband in California with nothing but a note saying that she is unhappy and that he should not try to find her.  She has no intention of coming home.  Her destination is in Kentucky: St. Elizabeth's home for unwed mothers.  It is where women from all over go to give birth and give up their children.  It is a Catholic home in a Baptist town.  Rose does not believe that she can be a good mother to her child and that she shouldn't be a mother.  Not now.  Perhaps not ever.<br /><br />The novel is told in three sections.  The first section is told from the perspective of Rose.  Through her eyes and with her words we learn about why she left California, how she ended up at St. Elizabeth's and what that experience was like.  Patchett writes Rose so well that when her section ended I couldn't imagine that the next section of the novel could possibly be as good as what it was that I just read.  Section two is told by Rose's husband.  The final section of the novel is given to Rose's daughter.  \\"The Patron Saint of Liars\\" is a remarkable novel.  It is filled with insight into the characters and it seems at times also into our own lives.  This isn't a story of faith, but it is also filled with a sense of grace and healing at all turns, even when the characters are facing personal difficulties.<br /><br />With \\"Bel Canto\\" I knew that Ann Patchett was a talented author and I wanted to experience her other novels.  After \\"The Patron Saint of Liars\\" it is clear that Patchett ranks among my favorite authors.  She doesn't slam the reader with hard hitting slamming dialogue, but rather allows that sense of grace and healing which is so much a theme of the novel come out in nearly every sentence.  As a first novel this is even more remarkable as accomplished authors would be fortunate to write a novel as beautiful as this.  I would give \\"The Patron Saint of Liars\\" my highest recommendation.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryaling which is so much a theme of the novel come out in nearly every sentence.

The events here in James Luceno's novel are the set up for the events at the beginning of \\"Revenge of the Sith\\".  The ending of this novel is the first act of the film.  \\"Labyrinth of Evil\\" opens with a mistake made by Nate Gunray, that Neimoidian who was so central to the blockade of Naboo which opened \\"The Phantom Menace\\".  Gunray, attempting to flee from the Jedi, leaves behind a clue which holds information about the location and potential identity of Darth Sidious.  As we all know and have known for twenty years, Sidious is Supreme Chancellor (not yet Emperor) Palpatine.  The Jedi are getting close to learning the truth about Sidious, and Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi are sent on a mission against Count Dooku.<br /><br />Dooku, however, has been instructed to kill Obi-Wan in the hopes of pushing Anakin over the edge to the Dark Side.  All of this is the master plot of Palpatine to gain complete control over the Republic and have the strong apprentice that he has desired.  There is quite a bit of discussion in this book dealing with the plots and plans of Sidious and Dooku and \\"Labyrinth of Evil\\" is also the introduction of a new bad guy General Grevious.  Grevious was really introduced in the Clone Wars cartoons on the Cartoon Network, but there was no character development and there wasn't any idea of who this creature was.  Luceno gives background and motivation and explanations of Grevious and how he had become such an incredible Jedi Killer.<br /><br />To this point I had only read one previous James Luceno novel, the prequel novel \\"Cloak of Deception.\\"  I was not at all impressed with that book.  It was a bit too dry and too dull and didn't do too much in setting the stage for \\"The Phantom Menace\\", especially compared to \\"Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter\\".  But \\"Labyrinth of Evil\\" is a much better book and is an excellent lead-in to \\"Revenge of the Sith\\".  Parts of this novel may be a bit slower than some readers would like, but this book gives excellent background to Episode Three with a second half which is filled with action.  In my mind, this was a satisfying Star Wars prequel novel and worth reading for a Star Wars fan.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryith\\".

For my needs, I found the guide to be quite helpful.  To start with, there is quite a bit of information on each character and which of the stats should be improved for each character, and which skills are the most valuable for that character to learn.  There are sections of the guide focusing on all of the weapons, armor, and items in the game.  There is a bestiary at the end of the guide giving stats on all of the enemies.  All of this is nice, but the real reason most people purchase a strategy guide is the full game walkthrough.<br /><br />The walkthrough itself is the part of the guide which may give the most help and cause the most confusion/frustration.  What will help the most is that the guide gives a very good run down on what it is that you are supposed to, in what order you should do it (in those instances you have a choice), and what some of the best tactics are to help you succeed.  The guide, in text form, gives description of the goals, enemies, and what items are won or found in the area.  There are some boss strategies included.  This isn't a very complex game so the general strategies the guide gives are really good enough (use crippling attacks or Arrows of Sleep when they work, use powerful attacks) for what the game requires.  In this manner the guide was quite helpful and I was able to complete the game with 100% of the tasks/quests completed.<br /><br />The downside of the walkthrough is a lack of clarity and a little bit of inaccuracy.  There are maps at the beginning of each chapter with numbers relating to which event is happening at which location.  Maps are usually excellent tools for working through a game.  The trouble here is that the maps are very vague.  Imagine a map of the United States.  It's a fairly small map and you know that Minnesota is somewhere to the north and in the center of the country.  Suppose there are only a few main roads that you can possibly take to get to Minnesota from Georgia.  If the map doesn't identify which road you are on or where exactly you are starting from on the map, you may end up getting to Minnesota but you won't know where exactly you are until you get there.  That is pretty much what the maps in the guide are like.  Some levels are better, others are worse.  I do feel that the text description overcomes the flaws with the maps, but there is no quick glancing at the map to get a grasp of where you are.<br /><br />The other downside is a question of accuracy.  The guide will list times where Crippling Attacks (an attack which will delay the turn of an enemy, it is incredibly valuable) are to be used but it turns out that the enemy is really immune to it (and vice versa).  This happens more often towards the end of the guide and since the strategies are typically fairly simple this inaccuracy is easily overcome, but it is a little irritating when you waste a crippling attack over a more powerful attack in a difficult battle.<br /><br />I think I would have preferred a few more enemy charts and better maps within the walkthrough section, but overall I didn't have a problem with this guide.  It helped me clear the game 100% (I'm sure I would have missed something) and to get all the best armor and weapons until I got too lazy to follow directions on the last chapter.  By no means is this the best guide ever, but it helped me finish the game and it covered all of the information that was actually needed for me to make it through the game.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryountry.

It is a rather slim volume, my copy only had 91 pages, but it tells a fairly complete story.  While this novel doesn't seem to fit in with the other Darkover novels, it does help to explain a little bit about who the Trailmen are, which is never explained in any depth in other Darkover novels.  Bradley also explains why this novel doesn't quite fit with the other Darkover novels and how this novel came to be in the forward to the book.  It is fairly interesting to understand how Bradley conceptualized Darkover.<br /><br />This short novel tells the story of the 48 year Trailmen Fever.  This is a nasty plague like sickness that seems to crop up every 48 years in Darkover's history, and Darkover is about to enter into a plague year.  Now that the Terrans are back on Darkover, they are determined to end the plague.  But the only way to do that is to get the cooperation of the Trailmen who are immune (and might in some way be a carrier).  The Trailmen are fiercely territorial and violent to trespassers.  But as a young child the human (the Trailmen aren't considered completely human, I'd imagine more like Neanderthal Man) Dr Jason Allison was raised by the Trailmen and is being recruited to lead the expedition to ask for the help of the Trailment.  But Dr Allison seems to suffer from multiple personalities.  One is a doctor Jay Allison who is a talented Doctor, but doesn't remember the language of the Trailmen and is something of a wuss.  The other is Jason, a rougher man who is fully at ease in physical situations and is still fluent in the language and culture of the Trailment.  Somehow a Terran doctor is able to revert Jay to Jason and the adventure begins.<br /><br />It is a decent enough novel, and it involves other characters familiar to the Darkover reader, in particular Regis Hastur, who is a major player in other novels.

Rather than attempting to continue the story which supposedly concluded with the return of Jesus in \\"Glorious Appearing\\", \\"The Rising\\" is a prequel.  It tells what happened before the Rapture.  This novel focuses on Marilena Carpathia, Rayford Steele, and eventually on Nicolae Carpathia.  While there are three primary characaters, there are really only two storylines here: Rayford's, and that of the Antichrist.  Marilena is to be the mother of Nicolae and so her story becomes Nicolae's story as the novel progresses.<br /><br />The section of the novel which focuses on Rayford begins when he was a young boy of four years old and progresses through high school, college, and his marriage to Irene.  We follow Rayford as he is precociously bright and athletic and popular, to an awkward phase or two.  Following each awkward phase he becomes once again even more athletic and popular in high school.  His father would like him to take over the family business (he runs a tool and die shop), but Rayford wants nothing more than to be a pilot.  Rayford pursues this goal, and while in college he dates the most beautiful and popular woman on campus, but he isn't happy with himself or with her because he knows that she is too shallow and materialistic.  But so is Rayford in his dreams to make a lot of money as a commercial pilot and have the life he couldn't have as a child.  Still, he finds in Irene a woman he can be friends with as well as love, much more so than Kitty, the beautiful and popular woman.<br /><br />Marilena Carpathia is a scholar and a professor in Romania.  She has an unhappy marriage to her husband, Sorin, who is also a professor.  The only connection they have is an intellectual one.  Marilena soon meets Viv Ivins, who helps Marilena realize her dream of having a child.  Through a corporation of some sort, Marilena is able to have a child away from her husband, but with the understanding that the child is as much the corporation's as he is hers.  The child, of course, is Nicolae Carpathia, the boy who will one day become the Antichrist.  After he is born we see just how unusual a boy he is.  He has a brilliant mind and can easily manipulate others to do his bidding, but something is simply wrong.  He is frightening to his mother (as well he should be) and we see how he grows to be the man he will become.<br /><br />While the section with Rayford in college and how he met his wife was probably the most interesting in the book, \\"The Rising\\" was completely unnecessary.  It helped to answer questions of what the characters were like before the Rapture, but it wasn't a question that actually needed answering.  There was already a sense from the Left Behind novels of what the characters were like, and the whole section on Rayford's childhood and even on Nicolae's mother felt pointless.  It didn't add up to anything meaningful.  There was no real plot to \\"The Rising\\", and there was no story that needed to be told.<br /><br />After \\"Glorious Appearing\\" was published I read an interview with Jerry Jenkins in which he said that there would be two more Left Behind books: a prequel and a sequel.  Well, we have our prequel, but on a page at the end of \\"The Rising\\" there was a mention of two more sequels to \\"The Rising\\" making it a prequel trilogy.  I really liked the Left Behind series, but there was a natural storyline progression that made the series incredibly compelling and gave a reason to read the books.  \\"The Rising\\" just didn't seem to have a point to it, and since we already know what happens next, there is nothing compelling at all to the novel...and yet there are going to be two more, probably focusing on Buck Williams, Tsion ben Judah, and other characters from the series.  The only reason to read this novel is if someone has read all the other Left Behind books and even though the story is finished, still can't get enough of these characters.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryaracters.   <br /> <br />-Joe Sherry	2005-03-28

At the moment I'm not sure how that series is going to be constructed because \\"Silverlance\\" felt to be a standalone novel with a complete story.  We'll see where this series goes from here.  \\"Silverlance\\" is intended for a Young Adult audience, probably in the 9 - 12 year old age range.<br /><br />With \\"Silverlance\\" the reader is introduced to Byron Thorn, a young satyr who is coming of age on a midwinter's night.  When he sees a new star in the sky, young Byron knows that it is his destiny to follow the star.  Alone he sets off and quickly gathers a group of young like-minded creatures including a centaur, a griffin, and two dryads.  Together they face danger and adventure in their quest to follow and find the star and perhaps find the returning god/king Silverlance.<br /><br />I didn't spend too much time describing the characters or the story because, to be honest, there isn't much to describe.  \\"Silverlance\\" moves along at a fairly fast pace, which is good for the younger reader, but there isn't any real development of the characters.  I no more have a sense of who Byron or any other character is by the end of the book as I did when each character was introduced.  That's fine, the book is aimed at a different audience and for what it intends on doing, it does well.  \\"Silverlance\\" does a good job at telling a story of \\"True Adventure\\" which younger readers are likely to get completely wrapped up on.  But while stories like \\"The Hobbit\\" or \\"Harry Potter\\" can be enjoyed on a different level by adults, \\"Silverlance really is just a children's book.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry	2005-03-15
US	52402330	R1YYXDAZMLURW3	1594200092	686377339	Alexander Hamilton	Books	5	5	5	N	N	an often overlooked Founding Father	Some ten to fifteen years ago there was a \\"Got Milk\\" commercial where this guy who had just eaten a peanut butter and jelly sandwich was trying to call in to a radio station to answer the question \\"Who killed Alexander Hamilton in the famous duel?\\".  The commercial revealed that it was Aaron Burr.  I was only ten or fifteen years old at the time, but for years that one commercial had comprised nearly all of my knowledge of Alexander Hamilton.  Later, after reading David McCullough's biography of John Adams, I learned that Adams held Hamilton in very low regard.  Until I held Ron Chernow's biography of Alexander Hamilton in my hands, Alexander Hamilton was a complete mystery to me.<br /><br />In a sense Alexander Hamilton is the quintessential American.  He was born out of wedlock in the West Indies and his early childhood is marked by his becoming an orphan at a fairly young age.  Hamilton's story is that of a self made man.  He displayed brilliance at university and his rise to prominence was assured during the Revolutionary War where he served with skill and bravery before becoming General George Washington's most trusted aide.  It was with the rise of Washington that Hamilton's influence reached the top levels of the new government.  Hamilton was appointed the first Treasury Secretary and still in his thirties he essentially created the entire economic system of the United States.  He was also the primary author of the Federalist Papers (along with John Jay and James Madison), which were a defense of the Constitution and an explanation of what each branch of government should and could do.  It was brilliant work.<br /><br />While Alexander Hamilton should rightly be considered a giant in an age of brilliant accomplished Americans founding this Union, Chernow's biography does not flinch from Hamilton's many imperfections and flaws.  Hamilton's greatest scandal was an affair that he had with a married woman while he was also married.  But, he was also a man who could not bear any perceived slight on his honor which led him to be very defensive and arrogant and prickly and may be the primary reason why this most brilliant of men and Founding Father never became President.<br /><br />Ron Chernow's portrayal of Hamilton is undeniably sympathetic, but I feel that Chernow gives a fair picture of who Hamilton was, why he is one of the most important figures in American history, and why he inspired such hatred and dislike during his time and after.  Chernow's Hamilton is a talented and brilliant man, yes, but one with just as many flaws and problems as any other man.  Here we see as complete of a picture of that fatal duel as any could likely present, and Chernow touches upon several different perspectives on what may have actually happened (see Joseph Ellis's account in \\"Founding Brothers\\" for another).<br /><br />This is an absolutely first rate biography that, while there is a slow start to this book covering Hamilton's early years, is worth the time it takes to read to learn about this Founding Father of this country.<br /><br />-Joe Sherrywho could not bear any perceived slight on his honor which led him to be very defensive and arrogant and prickly and may be the primary reason why this most brilliant of men and Founding Father never became President.   <br /> <br />Ron Chernow's portrayal of Hamilton is undeniably sympathetic, but I feel that Chernow gives a fair picture of who Hamilton was, why he is one of the most important figures in American history, and why he inspired such hatred and dislike during his time and after.

US	52402330	R2ZI1QCJT1JB7E	0765312131	598325741	Ordermaster (Saga of Recluce)	Books	4	20	22	N	N	more of the same from Modesitt	\\"Ordermaster\\" is the 13th volume in the long running Saga of Recluce.  This is the sequel to \\"Wellspring of Chaos\\", the first book to feature a cooper from Brysta named Kharl, a man who just happens to be a talented order mage.  Because Kharl is imbued with this natural sense and talent of order, even though he doesn't know he has the potential to be a mage, he always tries to do what is right and to always do his best.  This causes big problems for Kharl, his family, and anyone associated with him, and through an odd series of events Kharl ends up without a family but an order mage and a lord of an estate in Austra.  This is where we begin \\"Ordermaster\\".  While Kharl would much prefer to live out his life quietly and find his sons, we know that is not possible for the order mage.<br /><br />Lord Ghrant of Austra owes his life to Kharl, but Kharl owes his new life to Lord Ghrant, so it is only a matter of time until Kharl is called upon to assist Lord Ghrant in stopping a rebellion in Austra.  In doing so, Kharl becomes more and more adept at being an Order Mage, even without any training (as it always seems to be).  Kharl continues to serve Lord Ghrant and protect him (and himself) against those who dishonestly oppose him and try to do wrong.  Kharl, you see, always strives to do what is right.<br /><br />Modesitt uses a fairly standard template for his Recluce novels.  The description of the previous two paragraphs can be adapted to most of the other 12 novels in the Recluce Saga with only minor differences (even the four books which are about Chaos Mages).  So, at some point if you've read a couple of Recluce books you've really read them all.  Still, Modesitt does a good job in telling the story and he makes it always interesting to read about the actions, magery, and morality of these men.  There is enough time between new Recluce novels that the repetition does not grate as much as it would if one tries to read the entire series back to back to back.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I enjoy the Saga of Recluce and I enjoy reading new volumes in the series to see how Modesitt is going to expand on the world he has created.  There are still many things I would like to know more about in the history of this world: Westwind, the Druids, and the founding of Cyador, but until then I can still enjoy the new books in Recluce.  Just know that they are not significantly different than what he has written before.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry<br /> <br />The bottom line is that I enjoy the Saga of Recluce and I enjoy reading new volumes in the series to see how Modesitt is going to expand on the world he has created.

Anne's last couple of Pern novels were not up to the standards of her earlier work, and Todd's debut was disappointing, so I figured that perhaps this was a series that should be laid to rest when Anne no longer wished to write another story of Pern.  Anne's imagination had provided me with countless hours of entertainment reading her various books (not just the Pern novels, but especially Pern).  I could accept the end of Pern.  When I began \\"Dragonsblood\\" I was pleasantly surprised.  This was far better than \\"Dragon's Kin\\" and at times approached some of the better works of Anne McCaffrey.<br /><br />\\"Dragonsblood\\" tells two stories nearly 500 years apart in the history of Pern.  Lorana is a young woman who can hear any dragon (a rare talent in Pern's history).  With the second Fall ever of Thread on Pern imminent the Weyrs are understrength and there is a mysterious illness is afflicting the dragons.  Lorana is also a talented healer, so she is trying to figure out how to save the dragons before it is too late.  The other story focuses on a woman named Wind Blossom.  Wind Blossom is the daughter (now nearing the end of her life) of the famed Kitty Ping.  Kitty was the geneticist who created the dragons of Pern.  So, Wind Blossom is one of the original settlers of Pern.  Wind Blossom is trying to find a way to protect the dragons in the coming centuries because she fears that they may be susceptible to unknown diseases and she knows that the scientific skills necessary to save them will be lost within two generations.  These two stories tie together in a way that is reminiscent of Dragonflight and Lessa's quest to bring the Weyrs forward.<br /><br />Thinking back about this novel, the story is not that remarkable or original in Dragonriders of Pern series.  Parts of it have been seen before in \\"Moreta: Dragonlady of Pern\\", \\"Dragonflight\\", and other novels.  But Todd McCaffrey's storytelling abilities are quite a bit better than I had originally thought they were.  I was completely absorbed in the story.  I had always wanted more stories told about the original settlers (\\"Chronicles of Pern: The First Fall\\" is one of my favorite novels in the series) and \\"Dragonsblood\\" helps fill that void.  I don't know if Todd McCaffrey is going to continue to write Pern novels, but I hope that he does.  It was nice revisiting this world and some of the characters and he did a good enough job that Anne should be proud and honored by his effort.<br /><br />-Joe Sherrye Weyrs forward.   <br /> <br />Thinking back about this novel, the story is not that remarkable or original in Dragonriders of Pern series.

US	52402330	R1NUWRCFQQPCRO	0744004772	132024074	Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater Official Strategy Guide	Books	4	4	4	N	N	an extremely helpful guide for a challenging game	Bradygames brings us this strategy guide for Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater for the Playstation 2.  This is a fairly large paperback edition and is filled with details about the game and color screenshots from the game.  The most important thing to note about this guide is that it only covers the walkthrough of the game on the \\"Normal\\" difficulty setting.  While the maps would be the same on \\"Easy\\" or \\"Hard\\", the number of enemies and their locations would change on the more challenging difficulties.  The location of certain items may also change, but this guide does not cover any other difficulty but \\"Normal\\".  Since I played through the game on \\"Normal\\" mode, I can speak for how helpful it was for that difficulty.<br /><br />The first thing to note is that this guide is packed with information.  The guide begins by covering all of the items, weapons, camouflage, and different fighting techniques.  Everything is listed at the start of the guide.  This is very nice, but I didn't find myself flipping back to check out the techniques or items.  I just used whatever basic moves that I could remember and worked my way through the game and took whatever came my way.<br /><br />The real reason to buy a guide, however, is the walkthrough of the game.  Before every section of the game, this guide includes a map of the area and small diagrams of where the enemies are and what sort of patrol pattern that they walk.  This is helpful, but not nearly as much as it was in the guide for Metal Gear Solid 2.  The problem here is simply that instead of being inside a building the entire game, the player is mostly outside in a forest or swamp.  So, while the guards may walk a particular pattern it was difficult to determine just where you are on the map.  What the map truly helped with was to give a general idea of where the enemies are, how many, and a general idea of where the items are.  The text walkthrough (with some screenshots) is where the true value of this guide is.  The text is clear in where you are, where you are going, and what you have to face.  I've been playing video games for at least fifteen years, but Metal Gear Solid 3 is a challenging game without a walkthrough.  The boss strategies are also quite helpful and helped me to beat them (as well as helped me defeat a couple of bosses with only the tranquilizer dart).<br /><br />There is also a section which covers little \\"Easter Eggs\\", like hidden posters and figurines which reference previous Metal Gear games.  It isn't terribly important, but it does add a little extra flavor.  There is also a walkthrough of the Snake Vs Monkey mini-game (which I didn't bother playing).<br /><br />Without this guide I would have missed many items (I have no doubt about that), been spotted by guards more often than I was (which was often), been killed many more times than I was (very few times), and spent quite a bit more time than the 24 hours that it took me to conquer the game.  While this guide could have been more clear and helpful with maps and enemy locations, it was invaluable in getting me through this game.  The guide is probably not essential to get the player through this game, but I have to say that it helps a lot.<br /><br />-Joe SherryThe text is clear in where you are, where you are going, and what you have to face.

The only Star Wars book before \\"Splinter\\" is the novelization of \\"Star Wars\\", also written by Alan Dean Foster.  Because this book came out before there was even a script for \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\", things happen in the book that doesn't quite jive with what we know from \\"Empire\\" and \\"Jedi\\".  I'm not sure there is a direct contradiction, but the story fits better into the Star Wars Universe when the reader knows that this novel was written without any knowledge of \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\".  Think of \\"Splinter\\" as, perhaps, the red-headed stepchild of the Star Wars novels.<br /><br />This novel takes Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa and puts them on a diplomatic mission for the Rebellion to a planet which has some sympathizers.  On their way to this planet, the ship Luke and Leia are on crash lands on a primitive jungle planet occupied by the Empire, human miners, and a host of strange alien creatures.  As Luke soon learns, it is also the home of the Kaiburr Crystal, a crystal which magnifies the power of Force Users.  In the hands of the Empire this crystal could be a dangerous tool and weapon.  Since Luke and Leia have no idea how to get off the planet with their damaged ship, they decide to search for this crystal.  The novel gives a fairly fast paced, though simple, adventure story featuring run-ins with Imperial Stormtroopers, natives, and Darth Vader in a face off that foreshadows what will come in future movies.<br /><br />\\"Splinter\\" suffers from being a little bit on the cheesy side, as if it were geared to a younger audience.  It also suffers from the timing in which it was written, namely before George Lucas had conceived of \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\".  This last part isn't the fault of Alan Dean Foster or the novel itself, but this does affect the perceptions of someone reading the book in 2005.  Knowing what we do about the characters, the budding romance between Luke and Leia is a bit uncomfortable (as it still is looking back at \\"A New Hope\\" and how Luke looks at Leia).<br /><br />This isn't an exceptionally good novel even by Star Wars standards, but it is a time capsule of where the Star Wars novels came from and as the first Extended Universe novel, it's interesting in that perspective.  There's really no other reason to read this book, though, as it doesn't tie into any other Star Wars novel (or movie) or fill in any gaps left by a Star Wars novel.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryng romance between Luke and Leia is a bit uncomfortable (as it still is looking back at \\"A New Hope\\" and how Luke looks at Leia).   <br /> <br />This isn't an exceptionally good novel even by Star Wars standards, but it is a time capsule of where the Star Wars novels came from and as the first Extended Universe novel, it's interesting in that perspective.

Jeter's \\"Bounty Hunter Wars\\" trilogy set in the Star Wars Universe.  Typically, with a Star Wars novel, the protagonist of the story is a hero, a good guy.  In this novel there are no good guys.  The story follows Boba Fett, the most feared bounty hunter in the galaxy.  This book has a somewhat different style in that there are two plot lines occurring at different times.  The first storyline begins just after \\"Return of the Jedi\\" where Boba Fett had fallen into the mouth of the Sarlacc on Tatooine.  The Sarlacc is the creature Jabba the Hutt had threatened would slowly digest Luke Skywalker for a thousand years of torment (as if he wouldn't die of starvation or something long before then).  In this storyline, Boba Fett has crawled and fought his way out of the Sarlacc and is laying mostly dead (which is different from all the way dead) on the sand.  He is rescued by another bounty hunter, Dengar, and we start to get pieces of Fett's story and how he came to be where he is and why.<br /><br />The other story is set after \\"A New Hope\\".  Fett has accepted a mission to join the Bounty Hunter's Guild and be the poison which tears it apart.  He doesn't know that this mission is from Prince Xizor (Shadows of the Empire) and with the tacit approval of the Emperor.  This isn't something that Fett is supposed to come out of alive.<br /><br />These two things should be enough to carry a novel, but Jeter fills \\"The Madalorian Armor\\" with plenty of intrigue and strange characters.  There are odd alien creatures like Kud'ar Mub'at, which has set up the intrigue, and Kuat of Kuat trying to keep his planet safe but rich.<br /><br />While there is quite a bit going on in \\"The Mandalorian Armor\\", I can't recommend it.  Jeter is trying to do too much here and the novel never really seems to come together.  I understand that it is the first part of a trilogy, but it is all set up and very little execution.  In addition there wasn't really any character to care much about, except perhaps Dengar and the mystery woman who was a former slave of Jabba's.  It's a nice try that fills in some more gaps in the Star Wars timeline, but this is not essential reading.<br /><br />-Joe Sherrye wasn't really any character to care much about, except perhaps Dengar and the mystery woman who was a former slave of Jabba's.

This is the second volume of the Bounty Hunter Wars trilogy.  I read this book not too long ago and I'm already fuzzy on what exactly happened in it.  The storylines began in \\"The Mandalorian Armor\\" have not been advanced much, except for what happened off screen.  Boba Fett, having been rescued by Dengar, is trying to convince the galaxy that he is still dead, so he is hiding his true identity while going into business with Dengar.  There is a lot of backstory going on (which I call the previous book).  Then, in the other storyline occurring in the past we have found out that the Bounty Hunters Guild has splintered into two fragments.  Xizor is still trying to destroy the Guild even farther so all that is left is individual, highly motivated, bounty hunters.<br /><br />There is far too much backstory and characters explaining things and trying to find out how everything fits together.  There is plenty of chapters with Kuat of Kuat and his shipbuilding yards and Kuat trying to hold onto the control he has over the Kuat Driveyards.  \\"Slave Ship\\" is just a tedious book that takes far too long to accomplish far too little story and action.  There were a couple of decent scenes (trying to capture the Imperial defector was very good), but overall this was just a fairly weak novel and was very, very disappointing.<br /><br />Hopefully the concluding volume of this trilogy will be far better, because if I wasn't trying to read all of the Star Wars novels this would be a complete waste of my time.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry	2005-03-01

I had hopes that \\"The Ruins of Dantooine\\" could be nearly as good as the Traviss novel, but it wasn't to be.  \\"The Ruins of Dantooine\\" felt somewhat like a video game and it just wasn't very good.  The story was fairly simple and quest orientated and wasn't nearly as engaging as it could have been.<br /><br />The Empire learns that a Rebel Holocron has been left on the planet Dantooine.  The holocron contains a full list of all of the Rebel Alliance spies within the Empire.  If it falls into the hands of the Empire it could effectively crush the ability of the Rebellion to operate.  Everything would be compromised.  The Empire sends one of their spies to recover the holocron.  The Alliance sends Finn Darktrin to locate the holocron before the Empire finds it.  An Empire biologist, Dusque Mistflier, somehow gets mixed up into the search for the holocron and assists Finn as Dusque becomes more and more disillusioned with the realities of the Empire.<br /><br />This book just wasn't very interesting.  The story itself is quite basic and followed a video game structure with missions and a boss battle.  While the chance to explore Dantooine, and a post Prequel Trilogy Naboo was potentially interesting, the overall experience was weak and lacking.  The one good thing here is that there is no need to have played the game to understand the story, but I can only hope that the game was better than this book.  It was a nice effort, but the only reason to read this book is to read every Star Wars book published.  That's about it.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry	2005-03-01

The first four X-Wing books were written by Michael Stackpole.  The first four books focused on the Rogue Squadron, an elite X-Wing squadron which was responsible (in part) for the destruction of the two Death Stars.  But, now, at the start of \\"Wraith Squadron\\" commander Wedge Antilles has an idea for a new X-Wing squadron.  Instead of taking the best of the best for the Rogues, this new unnamed squadron will take the dregs of the pilots.  Wedge will take talented pilots who, for one reason or another, are on the verge of washing out of the Alliance military.  This new squadron, which later be named Wraith Squadron, has a different purpose.  The pilots are being chosen because they are commandos first and pilots second.  Wraith Squadron will be used for insurgency missions, the sort that Rogue Squadron performed in the first four books which was out of their specialty.<br /><br />Part of this book is, of course, spent introducing the new pilots.  Just as the Rogue books were focused primarily on Corran Horn, \\"Wraith Squadron\\" has a primary focus on Kell Tainer, a talented pilot who is trying to atone for his father's failure as a pilot.  There is also an assorted band of misfits, along with Kell, in the new Wraith Squadron.  One thing that marks this book from Stackpole's X-Wing novels is the humor.  The characters are consistently cracking jokes and being sarcastic and the amazing thing is that it feels entirely appropriate and not a bit out of place.  The humor works perfectly.<br /><br />Where the Rogue Squadron novels were focuses on Ysanne Isard, \\"Wraith Squadron\\" is focused on taking out the Warlord Zsinj, the current most powerful former Imperial now that Isard has been killed (\\"The Bacta War\\").  But getting to Zsinj is not an easy thing to do, so first the Wraiths are going after Admiral Tirgit, an Imperial who attacked the Wraith's base.  To do so, the Wraiths impersonate imperials and fly insurgency missions to win their battles.<br /><br />\\"Wraith Squadron\\" is much better than I had hoped, especially after reading Stackpole's novels.  It is funny, and Allston tells a good story.  While I would recommend reading Stackpole's four books first to keep the chronology, there is no reason to not read the Wraith novels.

Overpopulation has led to colonization of other planets and now the population of the Earth, where cities are covered in domes and the idea of being out in \\"fresh\\" air is frightening, is divided into two groups: the Earthbound city dwelling citizens, and the Spacers who live in their own separate dome and are from the colonized worlds.  Distrust, misunderstanding, and fear between the two groups are very common though there is very little direct communication or interaction.  When a Spacer is murdered in Spacetown and the only suspects are the city dwellers, New York Detective Elijah (Lije) Bailey is asked by his supervisor to investigate.  But, there is a condition given by the Spacer government: the detective will be given a partner: R. Daneel Olivaw.  The R in this instance stands for Robot.  Bailey, like many earthlings, has an innate prejudice against Robots but is willing to work with R Daneel because that is his job and he follows orders.<br /><br />With his job on the line and not truly knowing where or how to begin, Lije Bailey begins his investigation into the murder.  He has to deal with his own prejudice as well as that of nearly every other human in the City, all the while figuring out how to solve the case himself but still work with his robot partner. While the detective story here is the main story, what is most interesting is the vision of the future imagined by Isaac Asimov, how robots could be created so lifelike and what sort of prejudice and fear that could cause.  The story itself is kind of weak and not all that compelling.  What makes \\"The Caves of Steel\\" so interesting is the ideas.  The ideas about robots, the future, colonization, prejudice, and humanity are what allows this book to be better than just the story itself.  I wanted to know more about everything else but the story, but the everything else kept me reading.  Writing in the 1950's, Isaac Asimov seems to be a little off on some of his visions of the future, but as a whole this is an interesting novel.  I still prefer \\"I, Robot\\" as it examines individual aspects of the evolution of robotics, but both are good novels to read.  It may just seem a bit simple to today's reader, though.<br /><br />-Joe Sherrycolonization, prejudice, and humanity are what allows this book to be better than just the story itself.

The Rebel Alliance has intercepted a distress signal intended for the Empire from the planet of Bakura.  Since there is no longer a central Imperial Government, and the Alliance would like to start bringing planets into their fold, the Alliance sends a squadron over to lend assistance.  Included in this group is Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, and Han Solo.  Bakura is being invaded by a reptilian alien race called the Ssi-ruuk.  The Ssi-ruuk intend on conquering Bakura as an outpost to strike into the heart of the Empire.  They are going to use humanity as their energy source to power their ships and to help them expand to conquer the entire universe.  It's a little bit of a lofty goal, sort of a science fiction/fantasy stereotype/cliche, but that's the story.<br /><br />Luke and Leia begin the diplomatic mission to offer the aid of the Rebellion while trying not to fight the Imperial Outpost on Bakura, and hopefully talk the leadership of Bakura into joining the Alliance.  Leia works the diplomatic side, while Luke tries to figure out what else might be going on.  Meanwhile the Ssi-ruuk are using a force sensitive young man to help in their invasion and to try to capture Skywalker.<br /><br />Honestly, this book was a bit of a bore.  The implied danger of the enemy never materializes, and even though there is a space battle or two, it just feels like not a whole lot actually happens here.  The only thing that really is interesting is Leia wrestling with the fact that she is the daughter of Darth Vader, the man who had her tortured in \\"A New Hope\\".  Outside of those short scenes, this is a completely unremarkable book and unless you are trying to read every single Star Wars novel, I would recommend that you skip \\"The Truce at Bakura\\".<br /><br />-Joe Sherry	2005-01-14

After successfully solving \\"The Shore Road Mystery\\" (book 6), Old Mr. Jefferson allows Frank and Joe to use the cabin on Cabin Island for a vacation during the winter.  The brothers jump at the chance and invite their friends Chet Morton and Biff Hooper along as well.  Mr. Jefferson isn't completely altruistic, however.  He gives the Hardys a mystery to solve, though one he hopes will be completely devoid of danger and excitement: his grandson is missing as well as his collection of rare medals.<br /><br />When the brothers travel on their ice boat to Cabin Island they are chased off by a stranger, one who later turns out to be trying to buy the island from Mr Jefferson.  Might he be also searching for the medals and where is Mr Jefferson's grandson?<br /><br />This really is one of the better Hardy Boys stories.  The biggest positive here is just that the book keeps focus very well into the main mystery and the chapters move along at a fast pace.  While there is a formula at work here, the author does a good job and telling a good story that is interesting with a decent puzzle midway through.<br /><br />This review is of the 1966 Revised Edition.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry	2005-01-14

We see on the cover a big picture of Anakin Skywalker and with the title \\"Jedi Trial\\" the assumption is that this novel is going to deal with the actual Trial Anakin went through to become a Jedi.  We remember Obi-Wan Kenobi in \\"The Phantom Menace\\" tell the Jedi Council that he is ready for the Trials, and from the description of this book this is what we think the novel is going to be about (much the way we thought \\"Yoda: Dark Rendezvous\\" would be mostly about Yoda, silly us).  It isn't, of course, not really.<br /><br />An army of Separatists forces has landed on Praesitlyn, which is a Republic Communications Center.  The Communications Center is guarded, but not by enough forces to make a sufficient defense.  They will be easily crushed by an immense droid army.  To protect Praesitlyn, a former Republic captain Zozridor Slayke turned pirate is bringing his own private army to fight the Separatists.  He had left the Republic Navy because of the inefficiency of government's method of warfare.  Now he is fighting back against the enemies of the Republic.  Ordered to assist Slayke are a squad of Clone Commandos (after reading \\"Hard Contact\\", we know what they can do), Anakin Skywalker, and Jedi Knight Neeja Halcyon (the father of Corran Horn).<br /><br />Neeja is in the bad graces of the Jedi Council as he failed in his last mission to capture Zozridor and instead Slayke had stolen Neeja's ship.  Now he is ordered to help Slayke.  Anakin is given partial command of the military mission on Praesitlyn.  The bad thing here is that in a novel which is supposedly about the Trial of Anakin Skywalker, Anakin only appears in perhaps half of the book.  The other half is made up of scenes with Zozridor Slayke and a couple of minor characters who are part of the nearly destroyed home guard on Praesitlyn.  It's disappointing.<br /><br />The whole novel is disappointing.  It is filled with all of this military detail about the Republic Forces and some talk about strategy, but compared with \\"Republic Commando: Hard Contact\\", by Karen Traviss, it falls far short.  Overall, \\"Jedi Trial\\" is just a weak novel.  There is no real storyline focus, either with Skywalker or Odie (the ranger from Praesitlyn), and there is the disappointment by not really being about a Jedi Trial.  In reading the Star Wars novel, there is no narrative thread that would be lost if \\"Jedi Trial\\" is skipped, and that is what I would recommend, to skip this one.  It's not worth the time spent reading it.<br /><br />-Joe Sherrylled with all of this military detail about the Republic Forces and some talk about strategy, but compared with \\"Republic Commando: Hard Contact\\", by Karen Traviss, it falls far short.

Kingsolver was working as a reporter at the time and spent quite a bit of time with the women involved in the strike.  She gives the reader a different perspective on the strike; and on strikes in general.  \\"Holding the Line\\" focuses on the women involved in the strike and how the strike affected them, and also just how much influence they held during the strike.  Kingsolver admits her bias early on in the preface, so the reader knows from the start that the author personally sides with the strikers against the company, Phelps Dodge.<br /><br />After spending decades slowing winning better pay, better working conditions and opportunities for women and minorities, the union works are the Morenci Copper Mine are dealt a new blow and a new challenge: At the end of their current contract, Phelps Dodge claims that they are losing money and the new contract the offer is with reduced wages and the elimination of a Cost of Living Expense for its workers.  The way the workers have traditionally won concessions and what should be considered \\"human rights\\" (here I show my bias) is through a strike.  The union workers walked off the job at the end of their contract and thus began an 18 month standoff between the workers and the giant Phelps Dodge, which almost immediately began bringing in scab labor to try to break the strike and break the union.<br /><br />In a culture where women have traditionally been at home, \\"barefoot in the kitchen\\", the women in Morenci and the other nearby mining towns began to get involved.  At first it was just to assist their husbands, but as the strike continued and the police and the National Guard are called in and start abusing their power, the women become a true force.  They became the glue that held the strike together, and in the process found a sense of empowerment that they never would have discovered otherwise.  Kingsolver showed how this strike helped to better shape the community and brought the women together.  She also shows, through the eyes and stories of these women, exactly what Phelps Dodge and the \\"authorities\\" were doing, and it wasn't good.<br /><br />\\"Holding the Line\\" is a powerful book with a stunning story.  Barbara Kingsolver took what I thought was going to be a dry subject and brought it to life.  The reader is able to get a sense of the outrage and frustration and triumphs of these women as Phelps Dodge tries to grind their lives into the dust and break the back of the union.  But, the women became the backbone of the local union, and they were unbreakable.  To say that this book is a story of true triumph in the face of a corporate giant would be to mischaracterize it, however, because that isn't what this story is and it isn't what the end result happened to be.

Count Dooku, the leader of the Separatists and disciple of Sith Lord Darth Sidious, contacts his former master, Yoda, asking if Yoda would meet him.  Is this a trap or is Dooku seriously considering turning away from the Dark Side.  Yoda must take the chance and meet with Dooku.  This is a fascinating idea for a Star Wars novel.  On one hand we know that Dooku has to stay with the Dark Side as he is still one of the villains in Episode Three, but the idea of defection and redemption is a strong one.<br /><br />There is so much that is good in \\"Dark Rendezvous\\".  The novel features a very strong characterization of Yoda and for the first time since \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" do we have the opportunity to see Yoda truly interact with students.  Until this point we had Yoda the Grand Idea, meaning that we see him as the leader of the Jedi Council dispensing some wisdom and making grade pronouncements like \\"begun the Clone Wars have\\".  But we never see the slapstick Yoda who tormented Luke even as he trained Luke Skywalker.  Here we do.  Yoda has a wicked sense of humor, he is very sarcastic but is still the great Jedi Master and is absolutely in charge.  In this regard, the novel is a treat.  But even though the title is \\"Yoda: Dark Rendezvous\\" and the description suggests the novel is going to deal with Yoda and Dooku, this is only a small part of the book.<br /><br />The bulk of the book deals with a Jedi Padawan named Scout.  Scout has very little ability in the Force and has remained in the Jedi Order pretty much by grit and determination and by finding away to keep afloat.  She believes that she is very close to washing out and she is probably right.  Focusing on Scout introduces one of the best new characters into the Star Wars Universe, the type of Jedi we need to see: those on the margins.  Typically we see the Uber-Jedi like Anakin, Obi-Wan, Yoda, and Mace Windu.  Dealing with Scout also means that the reader is treated to seeing some of the inner working of the Jedi Temple.  The temple is a haven for the Jedi and there is pain in how empty the Temple is because of the Clone Wars.  We see some of the training and sparring and competitions between Padawan and this is the strongest section of the book despite the fact that it has nothing to do with what is supposed to be the main story.<br /><br />The stories of Yoda and Scout do combine, but \\"Yoda: Dark Rendezvous\\" seems to be much more about Scout than it is about Yoda.  I wasn't sure exactly what this book was about.  Sean Stewart does a good job bringing Yoda, Scout, and Dooku to life here and is excellent in his descriptions, but the novel does not have a singular focus.  Or, had this book been intended to be about something else it might have been better.  I do hope that Scout appears again in a novel and someone can make it through the Jedi Purges and can go into hiding, but I can't hope for too much here.  The bottom line is that Sean Stewart did some great stuff with characters, but somewhat less with the actual story here.<br /><br />-Joe SherryWan, Yoda, and Mace Windu.

The first book in this series, \\"The Elder Gods\\", was a complete disappointment and it is only my fondness and nostalgia for Eddings' earlier work that keeps me reading this series.  After the Domain of the God Zelana was saved in \\"The Elder Gods\\", the enemy, the creature the Vlagh, has targeted another Domain for invasion: that of the God Veltan.  As the Gods cannot actually act directly to harm another or protect their people and Domain, they must use good willed men and women to help protect the land of Dhrall.<br /><br />Veltan has discovered that the Vlagh and the bug like minions of the Vlagh are going to invade his Domain.  He is able to get his peaceful citizens to form and army and also hire out the mercenary army which helped save Zelana's Domain.  Most of the characters from \\"The Elder Gods\\" only play minor, supporting roles here.  Instead we are introduced to Omago, a favorite of Veltan.  Omago, like any good hero is incredibly provincial but intelligent and quick witted.  For example, Omago invented the spear.  Perhaps this doesn't seem like much, but in Veltan's Domain nobody had ever seen or heard of a spear.  So, while the rest of the world has had a spear for centuries (if not longer), Omago invented the spear.  Omago is one of the leaders finding a way to defend Veltan's Domain.  Meanwhile a former priest turned soldier, turned traitor has betrayed the Domains with the intent of acquiring all of the gold which was promised the mercenary soldiers for fighting.<br /><br />If this all sounds kind of dumb, it is.  But it gets worse.  \\"The Treasured One\\" is told through the perspective of several characters: Omago, Jeltan (the traitor), and a couple of other characters.  The trouble is that \\"The Treasured One\\" is more background than it is story.  Eddings tells us the individual background stories which have nothing to do with the conflict at hand and all of this background leads up to the same place: the Vlagh is about to invade Veltan's Domain.  But when we get back to the \\"present\\" time, we are then in another Section of the book dealing with another character's background.  By the end we are brought up to the present a good four or five times with very little actual progress in the novel.  Besides which, the writing here isn't very good, either.  The characters are still variations on the classic Eddings characters of Polgara, Silk, Sparhawk, Talon, Barak, and Flute (and others).  There is just nothing original here.  The action is described the same, though with somewhat less detail.  The characters all sound the same and act the same, and the old jokes are still repeated.  I hate that I have to admit that with this series it appears that David (and Leigh) Eddings has lost whatever craft they had with their earlier series, and this is very disappointing because I grew up reading The Belgariad and I loved those characters, and I enjoyed his other three series and there should have been no reason why this series couldn't have been as good as his earlier work, except that it is so much work.  If you must read this book, borrow it from the library.  It's just not very good and right now I would be very surprised if the series gets better.<br /><br />-Joe Sherrybackground leads up to the same place: the Vlagh is about to invade Veltan's Domain.

It is a non-conventional love story with time travel at its heart, but the novel is so much more than that, and it is also different.  Clare met Henry when she was 6 and he was 38.  When Henry met Clare, he was 28 and she was 20.  How is such a thing possible?  Henry is afflicted with what will come to be called Chrono Displacement Disorder.  Or, to put it plainly: involuntary time travel.  Ever since he was a child Henry has involuntarily time traveled when he is in a period of great emotional stress.  He doesn't know why, or how.  When Clare meets Henry for the first time, he has known Clare for years and he knows that they will marry when she is older (and he is younger).  When Henry meets Clare for the first time, she has known an older Henry all of her life.  \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" is their love story and it is an exceptional one.<br /><br />This novel is told from the perspective of both Henry and Clare in alternating viewpoints.  Niffenegger lets us know at the beginning of each perspective exactly when this event is happening and how old both Clare and Henry are in each perspective.  This is vitally important otherwise \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" would not make any sense.  While it seems at first that the story is being told without any apparent order or structure, it soon becomes clear that the structure is Clare.  Since she does not have Chrono Displacement Disorder, she ages normally and does not flit back and forth between the years.  The structure of the novel follows Clare from when she is a child and first meeting Henry through she teenage years to their life together as adults.  The structure follows Clare's life and her timeline.  Henry pops in and out of her life from age 6 through 18 and he is sometimes in his 40's, other times a younger man in his thirties.  This is why Niffenegger's telling us the ages of the characters is so vital.  Henry may or may not know some events in Clare's life because for him, depending on his age, they haven't happened yet.  This allows the reader to discover things about Clare and Henry as Henry learns them.  Sometimes he knows that something happened because Clare references it, but it is only later that he discovers what it was when he time travels.<br /><br />\\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" is a very moving novel.  Watching Henry and Clare struggle to fit a normal relationship into their lives despite Henry's time travel can be heart wrenching despite the fascination with when Henry will go next and what we will learn about their past together.  Audrey Niffenegger has done such a great job constructing this novel and making sure that it has a very firm structure that even the unrealistic idea of involuntary time travel (as if building a time machine wouldn't have been strange enough for Niffenegger) seems realistic and grounded in reality.  This novel feels real and true.<br /><br />I don't know that I can praise \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" enough or even adequately.  The best praise that I know how to give is to say that from time to time I encounter a book that blows me away, that I don't want to put down, and that is so magical that I am simply absorbed into the story.

Perennial suspect and Rogue member Tycho Celchu is believed to be the traitor who caused Horn's death.  While Celchu is under arrest we soon learn that Corran Horn is alive, though not well.  He is a prisoner of Ysanne Isard at the infamous Lusankya prison.  It is because of his release from Lusankya that Celchu is believed to be a double agent for the Empire.  A good portion of \\"The Bacta War\\" is spent with Corran Horn and his attempts to escape from Lusankya.<br /><br />The rest of the book, however, deals with the \\"bacta war\\" itself.  After giving up Coruscant to the krytos virus and to the Alliance, Ysanne Isard, a top Empire Intelligence Official and de facto ruler, has escaped to Thyferra.  Thyferra is the only planet in the galaxy which still makes the healing bacta wonder drug.  Allowing control of bacta to stay in the hands of Isard would be disaster for the Rebel Alliance.  But, because Isard gained control of Thyferra legally, the Alliance cannot attack without losing credibility or its moral strength.  The Rogues take matters into their own hands and resign from the Alliance to fight their own war and get Isard out of Thyferra.<br /><br />There is a smaller subplot which has to do with the investigation of Tycho Celchu, but the direction this novel takes is more towards the war against Isard and Horn trying to escape.  In the process Horn learns more about his heritage and we are treated to another excellent Star Wars novel by Michael Stackpole.  He is able to mix humor, action, and tell a good story that keeps the reader interested the entire way through.  He introduces new characters, strengthens our interest in older characters, and adds to the depth of the Star Wars Universe.  He also does a good job in completing the four book story arc of the Rogue Squadron.  Surely there are other battles, but this is sufficient.  The next X-Wing book will be Aaron Allston's \\"Wraith Sqaudron\\", which introduces a new X-Wing squadron unrelated to the Rogues.

This review deals with the 1964 Revised Edition and not the 1929 Original.  Fenton Hardy, the father of Frank and Joe, is engaged in an investigation regarding a new radar station just outside Bayport.  While the brothers want to help their father, they are brought into the mystery of a missing college professor.  Their search takes them to the Honeycomb caves as they try to find clues to the location of the professor and what might have happened to him.  Through the investigation they find a connection to the case their father is working on.<br /><br />There is a certain charm to the Hardy Boys.  These books are of a more wholesome time in which everybody seems to be part of a Lake Wobegon where all the women are pretty, all the men strong, and all the children above average.  Forgive me the comparison, but I am from Minnesota.  Seriously, the comparison fits as all the main characters are smart, strong, and courageous and always up to the task, even the girls.  On one hand, all the Hardy Boys novels are a little silly, but they are such good tales for young boys and girls, even the ones that are not quite as good.  \\"The Secret of the Caves\\" has a bit too many fortunate coincidences that are not so much a result of the sleuthing of the Hardys as plain good luck.  That is a drawback here, but as with all of the earliest Hardy Boys novels, \\"The Secret of the Caves\\" remains good fun.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry	2004-12-13

Holmes, never explicitly named, is nearing the end of his life.  He has retired to Sussex, England, to keep bees.  This is all that he wants to do for the remainder of his life, but the mystery of a mute boy and a stolen parrot comes into his life and calls on his skills of observation one last time.<br /><br />A young boy walks into town.  He is mute and he owns a parrot.  The only thing the parrot seems to say is a list of numbers in German.  When the parrot disappears there is suspicion of a darker motive.  The police call Holmes to investigate, and though he is reluctant, he does agree to help.  But Holmes' motivation is only to return the parrot to the child and not to solve the riddle of the German numbers.<br /><br />There is a certain amount of wistfulness in \\"The Final Solution.\\"  It may be, as the title suggests, the last Sherlock Holmes mystery, and the specter of the aging Holmes does give rise to this air of sadness and remembering what has come before.  So, in that manner it is a treat to get to see Sherlock one last time.  But as a mystery story there isn't much to it.  There is no true feeling that Chabon is giving all of the clues necessary to grasp the mystery (the twist at the end is nice and clever, though).  Perhaps the problem is that the stakes here (a missing parrot) do not seem to be sufficiently large to have involved Sherlock Holmes, despite the mystery of the German numbers.  \\"The Final Solution\\" is interesting for fans of Chabon, Sherlock Holmes, and as a little curio of a novella, but nothing deeper than that.  It is well written, of course, being Chabon, but it feels too light.  Too insubstantial.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry	2004-12-10

He is being tortured indoctrinated by Ysanne Isard so that he can potentially become a weapon against the Rebellion.  Meanwhile, Rogue Squadron and the rest of the Rebel Alliance believe that Tycho Celchu is the murderer.  They believed there was a spy in their midst and the evidence pointed to Tycho.  Wedge, and some of the other Rogues, does not believe that Tycho could have been the spy.  While the investigation and the trial of Tycho is taking place, Rogue Squadron and the Alliance are dealing with the trap Isard had laid on Coruscant.  She essentially abandoned the planet and allowed the Alliance to retake Courscant, but Isard had a virus called Krytos which only targeted certain alien species and can only be cured by mass quantities of the miracle drug Bacta.  Using enough bacta to save the planet will bankrupt the Alliance and selective use of bacta could destroy the Alliance from within by setting aliens against humans.  Through all of this, Corran Horn is attempting to escape from Lusankya.<br /><br />\\"The Krytos Trap\\" is the third book in the nine book X-Wing series.  Michael Stackpole has done an excellent job in creating characters (especially Corran Horn) who are as compelling as any we saw in the Original Trilogy.  Here, Horn learns more about the family history he was never told about and also more of the truth of Lusankya as well as about Tycho.  There are fewer space battles in \\"The Krytos Trap\\", but Stackpole is a very good storyteller for Star Wars and his books are among the most entertaining of the entire series.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry	2004-12-08

While other Clone Wars novels have given us glimpses into the lives of the clone troopers, none have given us this level of detail, though \\"The Cestus Deception\\" comes close at times.  This is a novel completely about clone troopers and even though there is a Jedi Padawan in the novel it is a reversal of the norm as she is dependent on the clones.<br /><br />Four clone commandos, an elite fighting force, are sent to a planet controlled by the Separatists.  The mission is to attack a chemical weapons facility which is making a virus which targets and kills only the Clones.  If used, it would turn the tide of the Clone Wars against the Republic.  \\"Republic Commando: Hard Contact\\" is a covert mission of the Clone Wars and one that features almost entirely clone commandos (the Jedi are secondary and far less important than the commandos).  We are given the opportunity to see how the clones relate to each other and how they truly are individuals.  They are just bred to fight and serve the Republic, but they have hopes and fears and distinct personalities despite the fact they are genetically identical.<br /><br />Karen Traviss is an exciting new author.  As a Star Wars author, one the strength of one book, she is already one of the best.  There is a level of authenticity that runs through \\"Republic Commando: Hard Contact\\" that just feels right.  Traviss gives us an intelligent, exciting story of one small squadron of elite clone commandos and she succeeds in humanizing them both to the reader as well as the Jedi apprentice in the story.  Karen Traviss is one of the few Star Wars authors who did such a good job that I want to read her non-Star Wars work.  This is a story which does not feature any of the main Star Wars characters, but it is easy to relate to Traviss's characters and fit them into our picture of the greater Star Wars universe.<br /><br />-Joe Sherrye.   <br /> <br />-Joe Sherry	2004-12-03

At the end of \\"The Misplaced Legion\\", the Emperor had been killed by the Sorcerer of Yezda and the Videssan army had been routed due to the failure of Ortaias Sphrantzes to hold his section of the line.  The army has been split into several parts, each with no contact with the others.  Ortaias has one part, the Thorisin Gavras has another.  Gavras is viewed by many as the rightful heir to Videssos.  The rest of the army is under the command of Marcus Scaurus, the misplaced Roman Legionary.  The plot of the first book in the series took a Roman Legion and through an accident of magic transported the legion to another world.  They hired on with the Empire of Videssos as a mercenary company and with the murder of the emperor, Marcus is seeking the one man he is willing to follow: Thorisin Gavras.<br /><br />Much of \\"An Emperor for the Legion\\" is one long march.  Marcus and his Romans, plus the rest of the army, is on the march through lands controlled by the Yezda and have to deal with random attacks.  After finally meeting up with Thorisin, they return to the capital city of Videssos only to find it occupied by Ortaias, claiming to be the new Emperor.  Marcus and Thorisin need to decide if they can accept the rule of Ortaias, or if attempting to assault the nearly impenetrable fortress city is worth the cost.<br /><br />This book is the logical extension of the story after \\"The Misplaced Legion\\".  We do not see much character development of the Romans (or anyone else), but by spending more time with the Romans we get a better sense of who the men are.  Call it \\"character explanation\\".  The initial intrigue of sticking a Roman legion in a completely alien world in which magic is fairly commonplace has worn off by this point, but Turtledove is able to tell an interesting story with these characters.  After this novel, the focus seems to be on the politics of Videssos seen through the filter of the Roman Legion.

These novels are set before \\"Star Wars: A New Hope\\" and feature a younger Han Solo than we see in the movies.  While these books were written before the Original Trilogy had even finished, they fit in very well into the Extended Universe, mostly because nothing that happens in these books has any bearing on the rest of the Star Wars story.  The title for this collection is perfect, these are just three Han Solo Adventures.<br /><br />Unlike most of the other Star Wars novels, the main villain here is not the Empire but rather a completely unrelated entity called the Corporate Sector Authority.  Being short on credits again, Han and Chewie take on a job to find a missing mechanic.  That sounds simple enough, but this mechanic is one that made many of the major modifications to the Falcon and he operates outside of the law like many smugglers.  This search for the mechanic takes Han into the Corporate Sector, an uninhabited section of the galaxy which is used for mining and is controlled by the Corporate Sector Authority.  \\"Han Solo at Star's End\\" covers this story.  Han fights the Espos (the military/police force of the Corporate Authority), rescues prisoners, and gets into tight situations.<br /><br />\\"Han Solo's Revenge\\" has Han and Chewie taking on a smuggling mission, but the cargo ends up being slaves.  Since Han refuses to have anything to do with the slave trade, what follows is double-crosses by the slavers and then by Han as he tries to fight back and get himself out of this mess.  This is also a bit of a revenge novel with Han's grudge against slavers of all kinds.<br /><br />The final novel in this collection is \\"Han Solo and the Lost Legacy\\".  This novel takes Han and Chewie on an adventure to find a mythical treasure hidden on a new planet.  Comparing this to Indiana Jones would not be out of the question as this is the type of adventure it is, even set in the Star Wars Universe.  At times, this novel seemed to be just a bit too silly because of the treasure hunting aspect of it.<br /><br />Brian Daley did a good job writing these stories.  This was before there was an Extended Universe (except for \\"Splinter of the Mind's Eye\\") and we get to see Han and Chewie go on three new adventures.  We seldom get to see a younger Han except as he relates to Luke and Leia, so these books are nice for that reason.  They are also fairly well written (especially compared to the 3-in-1 Lando Calrissian book).  My biggest problem is just that these aren't connected to anything else in Star Wars.  The Corporate Sector, while a good villain and a change of pace from the Empire, is never re-visited again (though I understand that the New Jedi Order series finally mentions it), and while the stakes are high for the characters, we know that the two important characters are going to make it.  A.C. Crispin does a very good job tying these three books into her Han trilogy (which she wrote some 15 years after Daley), but does a better job at telling an interesting story and explaining Han Solo.  Brian Daley just has Han being Han.  These are well written, but not quite as interesting or exciting as I had hoped.  The first book is best and the quality drops throughout each story.

It continues the story which was begun in \\"Jarka Ruus\\".  The former High Druid of Paranor, Grianne Ohmsford (the Isle Witch from the last trilogy) has been betrayed by one of her druids and sent into the Forbidding.  The Forbidding, if you remember \\"The Elfstones of Shannara\\", is the demon dimension which is sealed shut by the power of the Elcrys.  It is a nasty, nasty place and Grianne is now stuck there.  Her nephew Pen Ohmsford is on a quest to find the Tanequil, a tree which holds the key to rescuing Grianne.  Like many other Shannara novels, he was put on this path by the King of the Silver River, a mythical creature who has guided many Ohmsfords over the course of the Shannara series.<br /><br />While Pen is searching for the Tanequil, he and his companions (there are always companions) are also running for their lives.  They are being tracked by a fearsome killer which has already killed one of their own.  Grianne is left by herself to find her way in the Forbidding when she is captured by some of the demons.  Rather that slaughter her like an animal, there seems to be something of a culture (such as it is) among the demons.  Dealing with torture and captivity and isolation, Grianne fears that she may once again become the unfeeling Isle Witch which once terrorized the Four Lands.  She doesn't want to, but it may be the only way to survive.  At what price is survival worth it?<br /><br />The previous trilogy, \\"The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara\\" was something of a disappointment, but \\"Jarka Ruus\\" and now \\"Tanequil\\" have been something of a return to the earlier quality of the \\"Scions of Shannara\\" quartet.  Nothing has matched the original trilogy, but these are fast paced, interesting stories set in a familiar world.  What makes this new trilogy so interesting is the reintroduction of The Forbidding.  Unfortunately, \\"Tanequil\\" spends much less time on Grianne and the Forbidding as I had hoped.  There was much less Grianne than I had expected.  There is a theory that less is more, but in this case, less is less.  \\"Tanequil\\" is good, though \\"Jarka Ruus\\" promised perhaps more than Terry Brooks was going to deliver.

He is a founding member of some sort of secret scientific organization called the Junto.  The Junto are leaders in the community and they are working to continue to advance science as well as figure out exactly how to stop and kill the malakim, the \\"demons\\" that were discovered through Isaac Newton's alchemy and are the ultimate cause of all of the destruction of the past twelve years.  The exiled pretender King James has come to the colonies (since London was utterly destroyed twelve years prior) to claim his throne, but Franklin sees the hand of the malakim behind King James.<br /><br />Adrienne, the woman scientist who has been the driving force behind much of the innovation and destruction of the past decade, is in the court of the Tsar of Russia.  She knows there are forces of the malakim aligned against humanity, but she owes so much to others of the malakim who claim obedience to her.  She continues to search for her lost son, who would be twelve years old by the events of \\"Empire of Unreason\\".  While she continues to search for her son, and evade her own enemies in Russia, there is a new force in America.  A boy called the Sun King, who has come out of the West.  He seems to be a prophet, and leads forces from China.  But, he may also be Adrienne's son.<br /><br />There is so much going on in \\"Empire of Unreason\\" that if one hasn't read the first two volumes of this series (\\"Newton's Cannon\\", and \\"A Calculus of Angels\\") the reader will be completely lost.  This book suffers from the middle book syndrome in that it works to continue a story and set up a conclusion, but it cannot stand alone.  The reader is thrust right into the story and has to play catch-up figuring out exactly how much time has passed since the second book in the series.

The First Recon Marines are among the first on the ground and typically are given reconnaissance missions (hence \\"Recon\\").  The invasion of Iraq was different.  These soldiers are trained for a wide variety of missions except for the one they are being given: the first wave of an invasion.  \\"Generation Kill\\" is exceptional war reporting, as good as anything else that has been published in decades.<br /><br />Evan Wright is a reporter from Rolling Stone magazine.  He was embedded with First Recon and was able to experience the war from the moment the Marines cross the border into Iraq from the fall of [...] in Baghdad.  Being with First Recon gives the reader a rare look at an elite fighting unit.  A Marine has to be the best of the Marines to be able to make it into First Recon.  Most who apply wash out.  Evan Wright gives the reader the experience of combat and the invasion from the perspective of the Marines in First Recon.  These are hard men, warriors.  They are trained to fight, to engage the enemy, to kill.  They are trained for a very different war than the one they are called to fight.  First Recon is sent in to Iraq as an advance unit.  They are sent to roll through ambushes so that the main force does not get ambushed.  They are sent, at times, 20 miles or more away from any friendly force.<br /><br />Through the eyes of the First Recon Marines we see what conditions they had to deal with.  Their weapons jammed because they were not given enough lubricant to deal with the blowing sand.  Squads were not able to communicate with each other because their radios were often set to different frequencies by the administration and support teams, with no warning.  The missions were often not clear, and the Rules of Engagement (the rules which tell a soldier when he can and cannot fire his weapon) are constantly changing depending on the mission.  There was often an unclear line between who was an enemy combatant and who was a civilian, which coupled with the fact that First Recon was sent so far in advance of the rest of the army that they were essentially isolated made for a very dangerous and edgy situation.  As First Recon Marines, these young men in their early 20's were trained not to let the enemy get the first shot.  The trouble here is that it is not clear who is the enemy until they take the first shot.<br /><br />Wright shows us how the Marines live and how they talk and interact with each other.  It is crude, vulgar, often funny, and eye opening to see the sacrifices these men are making to serve.  In most cases they are not idealistic about the war they are fighting.  They are soldiers and this is what they are trained to do.  They have had \\"kill\\" drilled into them every day before deployment and combat is the opportunity to put their training into action.<br /><br />The life of a soldier, not to mention a First Recon Marine, is one that is completely alien to any civilian.  Nothing that we have or do even remotely compares to the lives they live and they work they do.  \\"Generation Kill\\" shows us some of the best the Marines have to offer: Marines doing their job well and efficiently.  \\"Generation Kill\\" also shows some of the worst of the war: poor commanders, civilians being killed, targeted, and degraded, and the wastefulness of war.  One thing that this book shows about war is that there is no simple answer or description of what war is and how it is fought.  There is good and bad.  Morality and immorality.  Heroism and cowardly acts.  There is a sense of pride that comes out of \\"Generation Kill\\", but this is not even remotely any sort of military puff piece.  \\"Generation Kill\\" is tough, but fair.

This spy is a double-agent in that he (or she) is working both for the Separatists (the group led by Count Dooku) and also for the Black Sun criminal organization.  Since the goal is the same for both groups, at the moment, there is no conflict.  There is, however, double the risk for the spy.

To go along with the cast of characters from the first book (Jos Vandar, Tolk, Jedi Apprentice Barriss Offee, I-Five) we are introduced to the young surgeon Uli Divini, who is taking the place of the killed surgeon Zan Yant.  Uli is very confident, very skilled, and very untested.  Jos questions whether Uli will be able to handle the work, though it is quickly evident that he can.  There are two conflicts in this book.  The first is in the new relationship of Jos and Tolk.  It is a relationship which is forbidden by their culture.  The second is figuring out who the spy is before the spy can cause any more damage.<br /><br />As far as Star Wars stories go, I enjoyed the Medstar books more than most.  Reaves and Perry have created a very interesting story here and a satisfying conclusion.  Granted, I would have been slightly more satisfied if the spy was the other person, but we can't have it all.  \\"Battle Surgeons\\" is a slightly better book because there was more of a M.A.S.H. feel to it, but there is much to like here.  Anytime Barriss Offee is on the page is a good scene.  She is one of the most interesting characters and the fact that she is a Jedi in training dealing with the potential for a drug addiction was a great idea, if underused.  There was less M.A.S.H. stuff here, but the interactions with I-Five (the droid) more than make up for it.  This book features, of all things, a quest to get I-Five drunk.  Classic.<br /><br />While this is a prequel novel featuring mostly on characters which were not in the movies, this Clone Wars novel helps to provide a feel (along with \\"Battle Surgeons\\") of just how the Clone Wars affected nearly everyone in the galaxy in some way.  While there are no grand space battles, this, is like a battle to secure one meaningless hill in WWII.  The battle must be fought because the other side wants the hill (though Bota is far more valuable than a hill), but in the larger picture, the hill doesn't really mean that much.  The opportunity to see the surgeons again is more than worth the price of having a book set around that meaningless hill.<br /><br />-Joe Sherrybeen slightly more satisfied if the spy was the other person, but we can't have it all.  \\"Battle Surgeons\\" is a slightly better book because there was more of a M.A.S.H. feel to it, but there is much to like here.

Crispin's Han Solo Trilogy.  It begins not long after \\"The Hutt Gambit\\".  This novel spans a period of several years (approximately 5, I believe) and leads right into Han Solo's first appearance in \\"Star Wars: A New Hope\\".  Unlike the previous two Han Solo novels by Ann Crispin, \\"Rebel Dawn\\" spreads its focus between Han Solo, the Hutts, Lando Calrissian, and Han's former love and now rebel leader Bria.  While this slows down the pace of the action, it also adds a level of depth and complexity not often found in a Star Wars novel.<br /><br />There is a lot going on in \\"Rebel Dawn\\".  Shortly after the novel begins we get to see the famous scene where Han Solo wins the Millenium Falcon from Lando Calrissian in a game of sabacc.  From here we move on to Bria Tharen trying to convince the future leaders of the Rebel Alliance that they should all unify and fight the Empire together.  At the time of this novel there were small pockets of resistance and many who disagreed with the Empire, but nothing was organized.  In \\"Rebel Dawn\\" we can see the Alliance begin to take shape.  From Bria's efforts we move to intrigue between the Hutts.  Jabba and Jiliac are engaged in Hutt clan warfare against Durga the Hutt (and his clan).  This section, which takes up a fairly large chunk of novel, is surprisingly interesting.  There is much more depth to the Hutts than we get from the movies or even the other novels.  Their culture is much deeper than throwaway lines calling Jabba a \\"gangster\\".  Hutts are that, and more.  Besides this, we also visit Kashyyyk, the Wookiee homeworld and see Chewbacca married.  For the first time (that I am aware of) we get to experience the domestic life of the Wookiees.  Fairly interesting.  If all this wasn't enough, the book is about Han Solo after all.  Han has much to do here, from traveling with Chewie, gambling, making the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs, reuniting with Bria, becoming involved in the actions of the Rebellion, and much more.  \\"Rebel Dawn. is a very full book.<br /><br />This is the conclusion to one of the strongest series in the Star Wars universe.  The writing is top notch, entertaining, informative (for the Star Wars fan), and simply fun.  It is everything that a Star Wars novel should be.  This book even leaves room for the Han Solo Adventures which are written by Brian Daley by giving brief glimpses of Han's exploits in the Corporate Sector.  This trilogy (and this book in particular) is far superior to Daley's trilogy, and is perhaps the definitive Han Solo story.  We get nearly his entire life without getting too bogged down in every single smuggling run and adventure he has been on.  Crispin spins a very good story here, and one which is worth reading for the Star Wars fan.  This book (and trilogy) gives us everything we need to know about Han Solo and why he is the way he is in Episode Four.<br /><br />-Joe Sherrythe actions of the Rebellion, and much more.  \\"Rebel Dawn. is a very full book. <br /> <br />This is the conclusion to one of the strongest series in the Star Wars universe.

Knowing that he wrote that novel, which was made into such a fine movie made me want to read something else that he has written.  \\"Shutter Island\\" is his most recent novel, published in 2003.  I must confess that \\"Shutter Island\\" blew me away.  Lehane is immensely talented.<br /><br />In the summer of 1954 U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule come to Ashecliffe Hospital on Shutter Island to investigate the escape of an inmate/patient.  This hospital is for the criminally insane, and the two Marshals are searching for Rachel Solando, a convicted murderer guilty of killing her three children.  When Aule and Daniels begin investigating the escape it is readily apparent that nothing is as it seems.  Rachel Solando was barefoot when she escaped and yet made it out of a locked room, down a guarded hallway, and outside the compound on an island comprised of swampland and a rocky cliff.  How could this have happened?  Why is the hospital administration so secretive?  Are there secret government experiments being performed on the patients?<br /><br />\\"Shutter Island\\" is filled with questions and the story becomes more and more compelling as it moves along.  The story is told with sharp, realistic dialogue and it is not long before the reader questions exactly what is happening, except that the confusion is so beautiful and engrossing that you have to keep reading to see how this will all play out.  Lehane keeps throwing twists on the reader, but he does so in a realistic way that is very consistent with the story.  It wasn't until I had reached the end and the reality of \\"Shutter Island\\" was revealed that I realized just how important the beginning of this novel is and just how well crafted a story \\"Shutter Island\\" is.  Lehane connects all the pieces of the story together so that everything makes sense by the end.  The ending, while a surprise, doesn't come out of left field.  Lehane leads to it, builds up to it.<br /><br />\\"Shutter Island\\" was one of the best novels that I have read this year, and was so good that I want to read everything else that he has written.  Some novels are just that good, and this is one of them.  Give it a try.<br /><br />-Joe Sherrythe story together so that everything makes sense by the end.

It is set just after the first book, \\"Rogue Squadron\\" which began approximately two years after the events of \\"Return of the Jedi\\".  Michael Stackpole had a lot to live up to with \\"Rogue Squadron\\" and he does an admirable job here and continues the X-Wing story.<br /><br />With the military successes of Rogue Squadron in the first book, the leadership of the Alliance feels that it is now time to make a strike on the heart of the Empire itself, Coruscant.  To do so, the rebels need some intelligence on Coruscant so they will be able to strike and pass through the planet's defenses and still be able to defend the planet should they prove successful.  Thus begins a different sort of mission for the Rogues.  The Rogues are sent undercover on Coruscant to gather intelligence and also to set up for the invasion force.  Meanwhile the ruler on Corsuscant, Ysanne Isard, is setting a nasty trap for the Alliance.  She is having her scientists work on a very deadly, and very contagious virus that acts similar to what we know as Ebola.  The trick here is that this virus will only be effective on non-humans, which is a major backbone of the Alliance.  Isard knows she can't hold Coruscant, but she wants to leave a surprise that may very well destroy the Alliance's ability to function.  Nasty, indeed.<br /><br />As in \\"Rogue Squadron\\", we still get exciting space battles, and the comraderie of the Rogues.  Corran Horn, still the lead character, is becoming torn between two women: one is a Rogue, the other is a pirate.  The romance angle here is told extremely well and should not put off the core fanbase of the series (younger males).  We are introduced to an additional angle of intrigue, both with Isard and the Empire as well as a potential traitor in the midst of the Rogues.  Stackpole is continuing a Star Wars series that is shaping up to be one of the best things in the Star Wars Universe.  A Star Wars fan should start with \\"Rogue Squadron\\", but there is no need to stop there.

The Rogue Squadron is legendary.  Responsible for the destruction of both Death Stars, as well as being one of the primary defense forces on Hoth, the Rogue Squadron is given the toughest missions and has the highest death rate in the entire Rebel Alliance.  Commander Wedge Antilles has been given a new mission for his Rogue Squadron, straight from Admiral Ackbar and the leadership of the Alliance: assemble the best of the best pilots and reform Rogue Squadron to tackle the highest profile, most difficult missions and try and end this war against the Empire.<br /><br />Emperor Palpatine might be two years dead by the start of \\"Rogue Squadron\\", but the Empire is vast and top Empire officials have taken hold of the Empire (even as it splinters apart).  Some planets may not even know of his death, yet.  It was a major victory, but the war still rages on.  Ysanne Isard, the head of Imperial Intelligence runs the Empire in everything but name.  Nicknamed \\"Iceheart\\", she is exactly that.  Isard is cold, ruthless, and subtle in her actions: a true intelligence officer.  She continues to hunt the Alliance, and in particular, the symbol that is Rogue Squadron.<br /><br /> The primary protagonist of \\"Rogue Squadron\\" is the Correllian Corran Horn, a former member of the Correllian Security (CorSec).  He is one of the best in Rogue Squadron, which makes him one of the elite pilots in the galaxy.  Corran Horn, while a great pilot and an asset to the Alliance, is also a hunted man.  Kirtan Loor, an underling of Isard and a man with a grudge against Horn, is put in charge of the mission to destroy Rogue Squadron and protect the Empire.<br /><br />Being a novel about an X-Wing fighter squadron, \\"Rogue Squadron\\" is filled with space battles and dog fights and is action packed.  This is a fast paced Star Wars novel and is one of the better ones that I have read.  Being set after \\"Return of the Jedi\\" means that we don't know how the story is going to play out or what the future is for the Alliance (every prequel novel has to fit itself into the known events of the movies).  This frees the story up a bit, and with a novel built around characters who were not even in the films (except for minor characters like Wedge), there is a sense of freedom here.  It helps that Michael Stackpole is able to tell an entertaining story that also serves to build the overreaching plotline of the X-Wing series.  For a reader looking to discover what happens after \\"Return of the Jedi\\", \\"Rogue Squadron\\" is the perfect place to begin.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryturn of the Jedi\\" means that we don't know how the story is going to play out or what the future is for the Alliance (every prequel novel has to fit itself into the known events of the movies).

It contains three Star Wars novels featuring Lando Calrissian as a younger man, before the events of \\"Star Wars: A New Hope\\".  These three novels are the only place (other than the early Han Solo novels) that we get a sense of who Lando Calrissian is, and how he came to be the man we see in \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\".  We get his history here, and some very strange adventures.  Lando's adventures in these novels are perhaps the strangest that I have read about in any Star Wars novel, so much so that if the book didn't have the Star Wars logo on the front cover, I wouldn't be sure that it is the same galaxy.<br /><br />The first novel in this collection is \\"Lando Calrissian and the Mindharp of Sharu\\".  Lando has only recently acquired the Millenium Falcon, and wins in yet another game of sabacc a droid.  The only catch is that Lando has to acquire this droid from a nearby planet.  Shortly after arriving Lando is arrested on false charges and is given the option by the governor and an evil sorcerer to either suffer death/lengthy imprisonment, or to locate a mysterious treasure of the lost race of the Sharu.  Lando and his new droid, Vuffi Raa, begin their quest to find the mindharp of the lost Sharu, whatever that may be.<br /><br />This novel is followed by \\"Lando Calrissian and the Flamewind of Oseon\\".  Lando was very wealthy following the events of \\"Mindharp\\", but poor business dealings and paying bribes has left him with little more than his ship.  Being the gambler that he is (it really is his occupation), Lando begins to win back his money on the sabacc table, but he also has to deal with the fact that someone is trying to assassinate him.  Being forced to kill a man to defend himself, Lando finds himself back in jail and once again recruited for a crazy mission in exchange for freedom.  This time he must navigate the Oseon system during the Flamewind season (think of really nasty solar flares that can seriously mess things up) to work with the police on a sting operation.  Rokur Gepta, the Sorcerer from \\"Mindharp\\" makes another appearance, this time with a vendetta against Lando because of how things went during \\"Mindharp\\".<br /><br />The final novel in this collection is \\"Lando Calrissian and the Starcave of ThonBoka\\".  This time around Lando discovers a creature in distress called an Oswaft.  The Oswaft is a creature that is able to live in the airless outer space, and physically able to make a hyperspace jump.  When the Empire learns about these creatures, fearing what they don't know the Empire moves to destroy them.  Rokur Geptra makes another appearance, still hunting Lando and working against the Oswaft with his sorcerer's magic.  \\"Starcave\\" fully explains the origins of the strange robot Vuffi Raa, and of course features more of Lando playing sabacc.<br /><br />To be honest, these novels are not very good.  They might be somewhat better had they not been set in the Star Wars Universe because they don't seem to really fit in with what we know of Star Wars from the movies or from the other novels.  They explain Lando fairly well, but L Neil Smith's stories are fairly weak.  They are easy reading, and filled with humor, but the level of quality is fairly low.  The one exception is Vuffi Raa.  This is a fascinating droid and one which I hope appears in future Star Wars novels.  Hopefully this isn't out of the question.  I cannot recommend this collection, though i'm sure Star Wars completists will need to read this book.  For a better look at a younger Lando, read A.C. Crispin's Han Solo books.

He was lauded by Nazi Germany, and was known as an anti-Semite by the Jewish population of America.  When the Republican Party could not come to a consensus on whom to nominate to run against Roosevelt, and after four failed votes, Charles Lindbergh came into the Convention like a conquering hero and was nearly unanimously nominated.  A week before this action, however, Lindbergh had made an anti-Semitic speech, and with the nomination, many Jews are fearful for the future.  Lindbergh's main campaign platform is peace.  He intends on keeping the United States out of World War II, and on this platform he wins in a landslide.  Shortly after taking office he signs peace treaties with Hitler and with Japan and the United States can do nothing but watch as Nazi Germany begins to take over Europe.<br /><br />All of the political details that shape the world are just to get the reader in the door and to open the book.  It is one of the best ideas for a book, especially one written by Roth, which I have heard of.  There could be an excellent political novel with this material, but this is all scenery.  The story of \\"The Plot Against America\\" is told by 7 year old Philip Roth.  This novel is told as if it were a real historical event and we its impact on the Roth family (the author uses the real names of his family).  We see the paranoia of Roth's father regarding Lindbergh, whom he considers a Hitler in the making, and how that paranoia and fear only grows and starts to divide the family as Lindbergh's presidency continues.  There is a program put into place in which a child (of a certain age) is taken out of the city and spends a summer in a rural community.  Philip's older brother is one such child, and when he comes back home Sandy is heavily pro-Lindbergh and is highly critical of the fears of the Jews (including his father).  This further divides the family.  It is through the lens of the Roth family that the effect of the Lindbergh presidency and the changes it begins to bring to the country and to the Jewish population.<br /><br />While this is not the novel I had expected, this is an excellent novel.  Philip Roth is one of America's masters and he has proved it time and time again.  \\"The Plot Against America\\" is no exception.  Like \\"American Pastoral\\", the larger social issues of the novel are told through the experiences of a family.  We get a sense of the growing fear of the Jewish population of America, even as riots begin to break out and America experiences its own Kristallnacht.  We get a sense of what it may have been like in the early days as the Nazis were first beginning to rise to power and first starting to stretch out and persecute the Jews.  This sense is tempered by American Democracy and how much more difficult it would be to have a full fledged fascist regime in this country; and yet, we also see how easy it is to begin.  The one real flaw of this novel is the ending.  There is no true resolution and (without giving away the ending), the reader does not quite get the sense of the lasting impact of Lindbergh's policies.  The ending feels rushed, and unsatisfying.  The journey Roth takes us on to get to that ending, however, is highly satisfying.<br /><br />-Joe Sherrythe city and spends a summer in a rural community.

There is quite a bit more going on in \\"Shadows of the Empire\\" than just rescuing Han Solo (besides, we know from Jedi that Han will be delivered to Jabba's palace).<br /><br />Prince Xizor is the head of the Black Sun criminal organization.  Think of an extremely powerful and global mafia, expand it to a galactic scale, and that is Black Sun.  Xizor is positioning himself as the top leader under Emperor Palpatine and directly in opposition to Darth Vader.  This is something that cannot be done directly, because to openly oppose the favorite of Palpatine is a death sentence.  Xizor discovers that Vader is instructed to bring Luke Skywalker to Palpatine, and after finding out that Skywalker is Vader's son, Xizor puts a death mark on Luke.  If Vader fails to bring in Luke, and Xizor is not implicated, Xizor will rise in the favor of Emperor Palpatine.  It is a fine line Xizor walks, but what else can be expected from the leader of Black Sun?<br /><br />Leia becomes aware of the threat to Luke's life, and she works to save him (even without him knowing).  She begins to contact Black Sun, always a risky venture, to learn what is happening and why.  This brings Leia and the other Star Wars regulars (Chewie, Lando, the droids) to Coruscant and the heart of Black Sun.<br /><br />Steve Perry has written a very good Star Wars novel.  It ties in to the films, gives explanations for events in \\"Return of the Jedi\\" (ever wonder exactly why Leia is dressed as a bounty hunter?), and tells a compelling story in its own right.  Xizor's plotting against Darth Vader is fascinating.  This is old school Star Wars in the model (and era) of the Original Trilogy, and if that interests you this is the book to read.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryader is fascinating.

Greg Keyes had already published 6 previous fantasy novels, but \\"The Briar King\\" was absolutely stunning.  \\"The Charnel Prince\\" continues the story set forth in the first volume.  King William of Crotheny and his daughters have been murdered by his brother, Prince Robert.  William's daughter, Anne Dare is on the run.  There are strange goings on in the Church and some of the clergy have been involved in some dark magic.  By the end of \\"The Briar King\\" the mythical Briar King has returned to Crotheny, nobody is quite sure why, or how, but only that it happened.  From this point we begin \\"The Charnel Prince\\".<br /><br />Anne Dare is in hiding.  She was rescued from a massacre by the swordsman Cazio and she is now under his protection with nobody else to turn to.  She sees assassins around every corner and to be honest, her fears are justified.  She is the heir to the throne of Crotheny and somebody wants her dead.  Cazio and Anne are accompanied by a mysterious drunkard named Z'Acatto.  Queen Muriele only has a tenuous grasp on the throne of Crotheny.  She is the regent for her half-wit son and with war threatening Crotheny, there is pressure for a new power to ascend to the throne.  Muriele sends the knight Neil MeqVren to find her daughter Anne, to return her to Crotheny, but all Anne knows is that her family was betrayed and murdered, so she (and her protectors) suspect everyone.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Aspar and Stephen (the King's holter and a former monk) are sent on a quest by the Church to find and to kill the Briar King.  The King's Forest is being overrun by brambles and mythical monsters roam the land.  The presumption is that the Briar King is the cause of this, and so must be stopped.<br /><br />The new addition to this novel is in the character of Leoff.  Leoff is a composer.  What exactly is a composer doing in the midst of a high fantasy novel rife with swords and intrigue and a little sorcery?  Good question, and one which I do not have a very good answer except to wait and see.  The good news is that Leoff is instantly one of the most interesting characters in the novel and it will be fascinating to see how he develops.  Leoff was commissioned by King Robert to join the court as the official composer of Crotheny.  Leoff has earned the disapproval of the Church because his music is not traditional enough and may \\"stir the emotions\\".  Unchurchly stuff, that.  With King Robert dead, Leoff does not know if he will have a place at court or what his role might be if he does.  But he intends to find out.<br /><br />Novels in the high fantasy genre tend to all have a certain similarity to them.  They are often set in a time that feels like the Middle Ages, have magic, swords, kings, perhaps a powerful religious organization, and have epic quests.  The Kingdoms of Thorn and Bone have all this, but Greg Keyes also succeeds in helping to set a new standard for the genre.  Greg Keyes, along with a George R R Martin, is setting the bar very high in terms of excellence.  One of the best things about this book (and \\"The Briar King\\") is that Keyes will start with familiar character types (Neil, Aspar, Anne, Cazio...these are all familiar characters), but how Keyes builds his world and his story is uncommonly well done.  He takes cliches like the corrupt church and the headstrong princess and weaves such a masterful story that by the time you finish the book, you would have never have predicted this is where the story was going, that this is what Keyes was telling us.  It is the sense of surprise and wonder that Greg Keyes has brought to his novels, plus a bit of brutality, that sets him apart and above many of his contemporaries in the field.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryswords and intrigue and a little sorcery?

US	52402330	R4OZ43EVW1M6Y	0896087107	875186396	The Checkbook and the Cruise Missile: Conversations with Arundhati Roy	Books	5	33	34	N	N	globalizing dissent	Originally titled \\"The Globalization of Dissent\\", \\"The Checkbook and the Cruise Missile\\" is a series of four interviews with author Arundhati Roy.  The interviews, guided conversations, really, are conducted by radio producer David Barsaman.  Roy is perhaps best known as the author of the Booker Prize winning novel \\"The God of Small Things\\", but she has also written three collections of essays dealing with such various subjects as the corruption of the Indian government, American Imperialism, and nuclear arms proliferation.  This book touches on many of these same themes, but also deals with Roy's personal life in a level her essays have not.<br /><br />The first interview \\"Knowledge and Power\\" was conducted in February 2001.  As the title suggests, the focus of this interview is on knowledge and power and what both mean to Arundhati Roy.  Roy discusses, as she does in her essays, the abuse of power by the Indian government and the arrogance of controlling knowledge.  Roy mentions how knowledge can (and has) caused arrogance and corruption in the intellectual elites.  Specific instances mentioned include the government letting Enron control and own so much of India's power structure, and the irresponsible destruction caused by the Big Dam projects.  This interview paints, in broad strokes, a picture of the overall worldview of Arundhati Roy.  This is fantastic stuff.  In Roy we discover an intelligent, accomplished, passionate woman who has taken the very human responsibility of trying to make a difference in the world.<br /><br />The second interview, taken in September 2002, is a much shorter essay.  Titled \\"Terror and the Maddened King\\", the essay begins with David Barsaman questioning Roy about the charges brought against her because of the novel \\"The God of Small Things\\".  This interview deals more with Roy's reaction to, and experience with, government bullying.  This interview feels as if it is setting up a future discussion, that there is a reason why Roy and others must speak up to the injustices caused by governments and Empires of the world.<br /><br />In the longest interview, \\"Privitization and Polarization\\", Arundhati Roy makes some bold, inflammatory statements.  She writes \\"terrorism is the privitization of war.  Terrorists are the free marketers of war - people who believe that it isn't only the state that can wage war, but private parties as well.\\" (92)  She then goes on to say that \\"Osama Bin Laden and George Bush are both terrorists\\".  To the American reader this is a shocking and even inconceivable.  Taken from a different perspective and reading how Roy explains her viewpoint, it is not as unbelievable as it seems.  From the viewpoint of one who is against globalization and the bullying of the government of the American Empire, the connections in Roy's logic are understandable.  She does make a point, however, to distinguish the American people with the political power machine.  This interview was conducted in November 2002.<br /><br />The final interview was conducted on May 26, 2003.  The title here, \\"Globalizing Dissent\\", is particularly apt.  While it is never stated directly, the primary theme running through this interview is the idea that the globalization of a \\"world economy\\", which Roy feels is the globalization of the American economy, is necessarily also globalizing a dissent against that same globalization.  This, Roy contends, is why the world is seeing a higher amount of and more intense form of terrorism against the forms of globalization.  It is seen against America in Iraq and Roy sees it firsthand in India.  In this interview Roy talks about how the terrorism of George Bush in Iraq is doing nothing more than causing more and more of this dissent.<br /><br />There is very much a strong tone of anti-globalization running through \\"The Checkbook and the Cruise Missile\\".  Arundhati Roy is against the broad application of power which is wielded by the world's most powerful nation.  She feels strongly about looking after all of humanity, not just those with power.  Ultimately, that is what Roy is trying to accomplish.<br /><br />The voice of Arundhati Roy is vitally important, no matter what one's opinion of her message.  At the very least it is a point of view which should be seriously considered as an alternative.  She makes very good points and argues them passionately and with intelligence.  She suffers no fools and has no patience with an argument made from simple nationalism.  This is an important voice, but perhaps one that many in the world will find uncomfortable as she argues against many of the foundations of Western Society.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this book expands and explains Roy's essays and gives a deeper personal look inside the life and mind of an important writer.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryon.

A \\"Blade\\" is a master swordsman who is magically \\"bonded\\" to the King, and this forces unwavering loyalty to the wishes of the King.  One of King Athelgar's Blades is a man named Wolf.  Wolf is one of the best of the Blades, but is in the bad graces of the King.  They share a mutual dislike and disgust of each other.  When the King learns of a massacre at a fortress that was supposedly impregnable, he sends Wolf to investigate.  This is no simple massacre, however (if a massacre can ever be simple).  The invaders slew several Blades, which is exceedingly difficult for anyone who is not another Blade.  The invaders also captured the wife of the man in charge of the fortress, but to complicate matters this woman was the former mistress of the King and also has a past with Wolf.  Wolf's main motivation, other than doing his job, is that his brother Lynx, also a Blade, was wounded at the massacre.<br /><br />With Wolf comes an Inquisitor of the Dark Chamber who is pursuing her own investigation.  Blades and Inquisitors seldom see eye to eye and had a mutual distrust of each other.  When they arrive at Quondom castle, they learn something disturbing: the invaders may not have been completely human.  The invaders appear to be part human, part beast, and it is these \\"monsters\\" which have taken the King's former Mistress.  Further investigation points across the ocean, and Wolf and The Inquisitor are still on the trail.<br /><br />Not being familiar at all with the other works of Dave Duncan and the King's Blades, I was unsure how much I would be missing by reading this sixth volume first.  While I can't be positive about this, not having read the other volumes, but \\"The Jaguar Knights\\" stands on its own and can be easily read without knowing anything else about the series or Chivial.  I believe there are little bits about different characters and events that will enrich the experience for the informed reader, but my enjoyment was not lessened by trying to figure out who everyone was and how this all fit together.<br /><br />The beginning to \\"The Jaguar Knights\\" was a little slow and I spent time trying to figure out who Wolf is and what exactly a Blade is, and what \\"bonding\\" is, but as the novel continued, everything was explained in enough detail to understand the story, the background (to an extent) and get the story moving.  At the point that Wolf and the Inquisitor are paired up is when Dave Duncan hooked me on his story.  It also helps that Dave Duncan did an excellent job writing this novel and took it in a direction that surprised me at several turns.  My high praise is that after reading this book I want to go back and read the rest of the King's Blades series.  Duncan is unsparing in what he puts his characters through, and that is something I appreciate.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryabout the series or Chivial.

The Terran Empire has rediscovered its lost colony and has set up a spaceport on Darkover.  But contact between Terra and Darkover is still tenuous at best.  The \\"Comyn\\" rulers of Darkover are keeping Darkover out of the Empire and are keeping the Terrans restricted to \\"Terran Zones\\".  In the decades since making contact, nothing has changed.  With individuals, there has been communication and interaction between natives of Darkover and Terrans, but this has always been on a person by person basis and not any sort of policy.  Some on Darkover, however, are pressing their lords to allow more interaction from the Terrans and to join the Empire so Darkover can move out of the \\"Dark Ages\\".<br /><br />Jeff Kerwin was raised on Darkover in the Spaceport Orphanage.  All that he knew was that his father was Jeff Kerwin, Sr, a Terran citizen.  Working in the Terran service he finally gets an opportunity to transfer to a world of his choosing and Jeff chooses Darkover.  He had been dreaming of Darkover his entire like and he felt as if something was missing from his life.  On Darkover, Jeff tries to learn of his heritage and finds that, officially, he has none.  The Orphanage which he so deeply remembers has no record of him ever being there.  His bright red hair marks him as a member of the Comyn (telepathic ruling class of Darkover), though he believes himself to be Terran, and this sets him apart from any Darkovan citizen he meets.  Because of his actions outside of the Terran Zone, the Terran authorities intend on deporting Jeff offworld.  Instead Jeff follows a voice inside his head and joins up with the Tower of Arilinn.  A Tower is where the major telepathic work on Darkover is done.  He finds a sense of home at Arilinn and also learns that he will play a major role in shaping the future of Darkover.<br /><br />This is the first time that the reader has had the opportunity to see the inner workings of a Tower on Darkover.  Finally we get to see what it is that the Tower Technicians do and what matrix work is.  The inner workings of a Tower have been hinted and spoken of by characters, but never before has it been seen in action (\\"The Forbidden Tower\\" was outside of a Tower structure).<br /><br />While Bradley deals with the same main theme that she does in every other Darkover novel (a Terran finds himself having to adapt to Darkovan culture and the conflicts of two different cultures meeting and trying to understand each other), she tells a rather good story in \\"The Bloody Sun\\" and shows aspects of Darkover which have been previously left hidden.  Bradley uses her main theme to explore how the Terran Empire is starting to change the lives of the Darkovans and how it is going to change the culture of the planet, which affects the Comyn ruling class.  Bradley uses her main theme to show the changes in the Tower culture and how the telepathy can survive on Darkover.  There are betrayals, heartbreak, and the amazingly fast romance that somehow morphs into a long lasting love which will last for years.<br /><br />\\"The Bloody Sun\\" is one of the better Darkover novels and one which is as good a starting place as any for the series.  It is a standalone novel, but ties into the novels earlier in the chronology and is the starting point for the \\"Second Age\\" of the Darkover/Terran era.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryhad the opportunity to see the inner workings of a Tower on Darkover.

Crispin's Han Solo Trilogy.  At the end of \\"The Paradise Snare\\" a younger Han Solo was proud that he was accepted into the Imperial Navy and he looked forward to his career as an Imperial Soldier (potentially an officer) and a pilot.  When we begin \\"The Hutt Gambit\\" we learn that Han had been dishonorably discharged from the service and he can be found in a bar with a Wookiee who has sworn a life debt to Han.  The Wookiee, of course, is Chewbacca.  Han acted against a superior office when he rescued Chewie from slavery, and from being killed.  This brings Han full circle to become the smuggler we know in \\"A New Hope\\".<br /><br />To start, Han does not want Chewbacca around.  Han feels that there is no other way that he could have acted, and he was also paying off a debt that he felt he owed to a wookiee in \\"The Paradise Snare\\".  But, Chewbacca insists and Han quickly gets used to having someone around to talk to.  Han hires himself (and thus Chewie) out to the Hutts on the Smuggler's Moon.  Specifically, Han takes employment with Jiliac and Jabba.  Yes, that Jabba.  This gets Han involved, on the periphery, of the interclan conflicts of the Hutts and also into battle with the Empire which is seeking to take control of some of the Hutt wealth.<br /><br />\\"The Hutt Gambit\\" foreshadows Han's role in the Star Wars Trilogy, and does a good job in developing his character into the man we meet in \\"A New Hope\\".  It sets up the relationships between Han and Lando, Boba Fett (this was interesting), Jabba, and Han's response to the Empire.  This was a fast paced story and should be interesting to the Star Wars fan.  I don't know how accessible this would be to those who are not familiar with Star Wars and it goes without saying that reading \\"The Paradise Snare\\" first is a must.  This is worth reading for the Star Wars fan, but everyone else has to decide where they would like to enter the Star Wars universe.<br /><br />-Joe SherryJoe Sherry	2004-09-15

Like nearly all Terrans on Darkover, he has spent all of his time in the Terran Zone and not actually among native Darkovans (which is the way the ruling class of Darkover wants it).  He is demoted after causing a nearly horrific accident at the Thendara Spaceport.  It seems that Dan has been having \\"visions\\" where he suddenly finds himself in some castle somewhere, but he doesn't actually go anywhere.  When this happens on the job, accidents can and do happen.  While Dan is skilled at what he does, the accident was so severe that he can no longer be trusted to do his job.  When the Darkovan Lord Valdir Alton requests a Terran to help teach and train Darkovans to grind glass for telescope and binocular lenses, the Terran Vice-Coordinator selects Dan to do the job.  It is the only job that could keep Dan from being transferred off-planet.<br /><br />One of the visions that Dan keeps having has to do with a young woman, red-haired, in chains, and covered with fire.<br /><br />Since Darkover novels tend to be told from multiple perspectives (Terran and Darkovan), we are also told the story of the Storn family.  Storn castle has been taken over by a bandit army and the Storns have been imprisoned.  Lord Loran Storn, blind and nearly helpless, has protected himself with his laran (esp) power and has also sent his sister Melitta out to find help.  Loran has also been trying to find a way to help his family himself, so he uses his laran to try to control someone and get the help the Storns need.  That someone just happens to be Dan Barron.<br /><br />Once again, as in the majority of the Darkover novels, \\"The Winds of Darkover\\" deals with the cultural differences between Terrans and the natives of Darkover and there is a Terran trying to assimilate to the new Darkovan culture.  This is such a common theme that Bradley works with, but due to the nature of her world it is one that is necessary.<br /><br />\\"The Winds of Darkover\\" feels more like a set-up novel than one that is telling a new story.  It is world building.  This story introduces Dan Barron to Darkover, but it also introduces something called the \\"Sharra Matrix\\" which will be important later in the series.  The Sharra Matrix is powerful laran magic.  It was outlawed years ago because it was viewed as \\"dangerous\\" and also \\"pagan\\" (of sorts).  It can create powerful fire magic in the hands of a leronis (one who can command laran).  \\"The Winds of Darkover\\" introduces this concept and a couple of others to our understanding of Darkover, but as a standalone novel it is not anything truly special.  It builds on what we know of Darkover, but in the basics of the story it is one that Bradley has told several times set in Darkover.<br /><br />By no means is this one of the best Darkover novels, though it is decent enough.  \\"The Winds of Darkover\\" is one for fans of the series because it fills in some details and introduces a couple of characters and concepts that will be used later in the series, but unless you are trying to work your way through the entire series (as i am), this is one that you can easily skip.

The Legion and Celt are forced to cooperate to stay alive and not knowing how to get back or even if it is possible, the Legion takes service in with the local empire as a mercenary band.  They are, of course, some of the finest fighters that this Empire has seen and they know battle tactics that the world has never seen.<br /><br />This is the premise of \\"The Misplaced Legion.\\"  There are, I understand, ties to the Byzantine Empire in how this novel is constructed.  If one has knowledge of that era then perhaps this novel will resonate more, but coming into \\"The Misplaced Legion\\" without that knowledge of history I was able to appreciate Turtledove's craft just as well.<br /><br />This new Empire of Videssos is one where magic works and is fairly common.  Marcus Scaurus, the Legion Commander finds himself mixed up in the politics of Videssos simply by being a talented mercenary commander and being for a foreign world.  He finds himself in opposition to an evil sorcerer and helps lead Videssos against this sorcerer.<br /><br />Much of this novel deals with the Romans in a new world and their adjustments, but with the battles against the sorcerer and the Yezda (the people the sorcerer belongs to, and leads) the storyline is one that looks to stretch across multiple volumes.

A man sits by himself on a subway and watches a group of teenagers harass a woman and try to steal her purse.  She gets away from them and moves closer, sitting down next to the men.  The teenagers follow and try again to grab the woman's purse.  This time the man stands up, raises his arm, and says \\"Hey\\".  What follows is the man being struck, knocked down, and kicked until he is unconscious.  This is the starting point of Alex Garland's third novel \\"The Coma\\".<br /><br />The man (he remains unnamed throughout the novel) is released fairly quickly from the hospital and returns home.  He tries, cautiously, to enter back into his life, but he begins noticing strange jumps in time and a selective amnesia.  Acquaintances tell them man that they don't know something because the man doesn't know it either.  Things do not add up or make sense to the man and he knows he has to return to the hospital.  He is still in the coma, and these episodes are his coma dreams.<br /><br />\\"The Coma\\" is a short novel, with less than 200 pages.  This brevity gives rise to added tension in the story as Garland is able to build the narrative in little chunks that feel like movie scenes.  We feel the jumps in the narrative, these confusing dreams as the man tries to figure out what happened to him, where he is, and how to get back to life.  We feel the man's confusion in not knowing what is a coma dream and what is reality.  Garland's technique is very effective.<br /><br />Reading \\"The Coma\\" is trying to decipher the man's memories and take the man's journey through his unconscious.  In the coma dream something is real only if the man can remember it.  There is no rhyme or reason to what he remembers and why he remembers what he does, but isn't that how memory?  Alex Garland takes the reader on a eerie trip through a man's unconscious and coma ridden dreams, and in the process tells a very interesting (and slightly creepy) story.<br /><br />Garland is the author of the novels \\"The Beach\\" and \\"The Tesseract\\" and also wrote the screenplay for the zombie horror film \\"28 Days Later.\\"  His fiction is something to be anticipated and thus far it has not disappointed, though it is never what is expected.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryls \\"The Beach\\" and \\"The Tesseract\\" and also wrote the screenplay for the zombie horror film \\"28 Days Later.\\"  His fiction is something to be anticipated and thus far it has not disappointed, though it is never what is expected.   <br /> <br />-Joe Sherry	2004-09-02

This is the first volume of the new (in 1991) series \\"The Hardy Boys Casefiles\\", and it is a more adult and action packed series than the original series.  This is never more evident than the first two pages of the book.  Whereas the original series (started in 1927 and it is still running today) would have various plots by criminals, nobody ever seemed to get killed or nothing too serious would ever happen, but \\"Dead on Target\\" opens with the killing of Joe Hardy's girlfriend (and sister of good friend Chet) Iola Morton.  For a series that has been known for its lack of actual murders of any on screen character, this was a shocking and explosive (no pun intended as it was by a bomb that killed Iola) moment.  It marked the different direction that the Casefiles would take the reader, as well as the Hardys, on.<br /><br />A car bomb was the cause of death for Iola Morton.  Frank and Joe, as well as Iola and Frank's girlfriend Callie Shaw, were at the mall preparing for a political rally.  Iola ends up returning to the Hardys' car to pick up more campaign materials when it explodes, killing her.  Joe blames himself because his flirting with another girl made Iola mad and this is what led her to be at the car by herself.  At the funeral, \\"Dead on Target\\" takes another twist by introducing the character of The Grey Man.  The Grey Man is a member of a secret government organization called \\"The Network\\".  \\"The Network\\" believes that an international group of terrorists, \\"The Assassins\\", were responsible for Iola's death and are planning something big for the political rally the following week.<br /><br />The rest of the novel finds Frank and Joe traveling to London, fighting several members of the Assassins, being in the midst of gun battles and defusing a bomb.  \\"Dead on Target\\" is fast paced with a tighter story than what is found through most of the original series.  For fans of the Hardy Boys, \\"Dead on Target\\" is likely to be a favorite.  It is not for the purists of the series, though.  This book takes the brothers down a different timeline than we find in the main series.  Since the main series continued to be published at the same time as the Casefiles, these books (Casefiles) are either set at a later date than the continuing series or is part of some alternative timeline since Iola is still alive in the main series.<br /><br />\\"Dead on Target\\" has more violence than the \\"classic\\" Hardy Boys, but this is a very interesting story, even if it is a bit far fetched.  For the first time, terrorism and murder have been introduced to Bayport and the Casefiles bring the reader a new style of story with the Hardys.  As an introduction to the Casefiles as well as a new episode in the lives of the Hardys, this is a good place to start.

The action takes place two years after \\"Attack of the Clones.\\"  As can be guessed from the title of both the book and the duology, \\"Battle Surgeons\\" gives readers the first true look at a side of the Galaxy that has never been seen before.  These battle surgeons are the ones who clean up the messes of all the wars and battles and try to save lives in the midst of a war.  Think of it as the Star Wars version of M.A.S.H. and you will have a sense of exactly what \\"Battle Surgeons\\" is.<br /><br />This story takes place on, and around, the planet Drongar.  There is some backstory presented that there is a rare plant which can be used as something of a miracle drug for a variety of species throughout the galaxy and the Clone Wars have come to Drongar for the control of this plant/drug.  This is the background, but it isn't terribly important because the story is really about the M.A.S.H. unit.  The heart of \\"Battle Surgeons\\" lies in the interaction between the various surgeons: Jos Vondar, Zan Yant, Tolk le Trene, and the Jedi Padawan Barriss Offee sent to investigate the situation on Drongar.  There is, of course, the love interest between Jos and Tolk, which is complicated by their cultural restrictions.  But, added to the mix is also the protocol droid I-Five.  Readers may remember I-Five from \\"Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter\\", which was also written by Michael Reaves.  I-Five is a droid which has more human emotional characteristics than most droids, more so than some humans would think possible for a droid.  He is also a much more interesting character (on the page) than C-3PO (not in this book).  For example, we see I-Five gambling with the other surgeons, holding his own in both the game as well as in the give and take of conversation.<br /><br />There is a main plot thread about smuggling the rare plant from Drongar, but what makes this story shine is the interactions within the M.A.S.H. unit (if I were more familiar with the show I would be able to extend the analogy to the characters).  This is a much funnier book than many of the other Star Wars novels, and while they all use humor, the humor in \\"Battle Surgeons\\" felt appropriate and fitting for who the characters are and the situation they are dealing with.  Then again, I was prepped for this novel by periodically watching M.A.S.H. reruns over the years.  \\"Battle Surgeons\\" is an entertaining look into an overlooked part of the Star Wars universe, and one which also sets up the continuing story in \\"Medstar II: Healer\\".  This volume was good enough that I am looking to read the second volume over many of the other Star Wars novels that have been published.<br /><br />-Joe Sherrye more familiar with the show I would be able to extend the analogy to the characters).

The Jedi Council learned that on the planet Ord Cestus, a new type of droid was being manufactured.  This new droid was nicknamed the \\"Jedi Killer\\" and when given the opportunity to test their powers against a non-lethal version of the JK, the Jedi discover that this droid may actually be force sensitive and is able to \\"sense\\" what its opponent is going to do before the action is done.  This is similar (if not the same) as what the Jedi are able to do.  An example of this is the ability of Anakin Skywalker to be able to pod race in Episode One.  A whole line of these droids in the hands of the Separatists could potentially mean the extinction of the Jedi and the destruction of the Republic.<br /><br />Ord Cestus is still a Republic planet, but with the Jedi Killer droids, the question is: for how long?  Obi-Wan Kenobi and Kit Fisto are sent to Ord Cestus to take care of this problem, diplomatically if possible, by other means if not.  Obi-Wan works with the leaders of Ord Cestus to try to resolve the JK problem peacefully, but Kit Fisto starts sowing the seeds for a rebellion in case diplomacy fails.  With Fisto are a squadron of Clone Troopers to help set up the rebellion.<br /><br />One of these Clone Troopers, A-98 (or, Nate) was engineered to be one of the elite.  Nate is in a leadership position and we see the training of the Clone Troopers through his eyes and \\"The Cestus Deception\\" gives us our first chance to really get to see the life of a Clone Trooper.  Steven Barnes could have easily given us a story that barely touched upon the Troopers, but he didn't, and the Clones have now been humanized in the Star Wars Universe.<br /><br />\\"The Cestus Deception\\" was a rather good prequel era Star Wars novel.  It expanded upon the Clone Wars, giving the reader bits more detail about what is happening and how many smaller events are making up the whole of the Clone Wars.  Something else that \\"The Cestus Deception\\" did was also touched on in \\"Shatterpoint\\".  There is a change in the nature and role of the Jedi.  The Jedi are not soldiers and they do not fight wars.  It is against their nature.  When thrust into the Clone Wars, which the Jedi have no choice but to fight as they can, they are forced to do things that would not be considered very Jedi-like.  In doing so, the Jedi individually have to struggle to maintain their balance in their actions.  Obi-Wan and Kit Fisto are put into such a situation in \\"The Cestus Deception\\" and while their actions seem to be out of character, they struggle with what they are required to do.  For me, this helps put this novel into a greater context of the Clone Wars and the affect of the wars on the Jedi.<br /><br />The political intrigue and the sections on the Clone Troopers made \\"The Cestus Deception\\" a fascinating entry into the Star Wars universe.  Like the other Star Wars novels, this was a fast paced story and was easy to read.  For fans of the Star Wars novels, this is worth the time to read.

Religion is outlawed.  Christians are persecuted for simply claiming to believe.  Paul Stepola was one of the top guys in the National Peace Organization and was very good at his job at finding, and rooting out underground Christian groups.  This was until he was blinded during a raid.  Stepola had continued to research the New Testament to better understand what he was up against, but with the held of a new friend, he was moved by the Bible and became a believer, and had his sight restored.  If this sounds familiar, it mirrors the story of Saul/Paul of Tarsus from the Biblical book \\"Acts of the Apostles\\".<br /><br />\\"Silenced\\" begins with Paul continuing to work in the NPO as a double agent, giving intelligence to the underground believers while trying to maintain his cover.  He is unable to tell his wife that he is a Christian for fear that she will turn him in or tell her father (an even higher ranking member of the NPO).  This would lead to death, for professing faith in Christ is treason to the world government.<br /><br />Paul's task is to find a \\"Christian terrorist\\" named Styr Magnor.  Magnor has claimed responsibility for the incident which somehow instantly removed all water from Las Angeles.  This is a blessing in disguise for Paul because while Paul knows that the L.A. incident was the result of prayer and the action of God, he does not believe that Magnor is a part of the Christian Underground.  Rather, Magnor has been committing murderous acts throughout the world, bombing major landmarks and killing hundreds, and this is the antithesis of what the Christian Underground is about.  Stopping Magnor will do two major things.  First, the NPO is suspicious about Paul's true loyalty, and stopping Magnor will be a major proof of loyalty.  Second, Styr Magnor's actions are making all Christians look bad, and they are already treasonous for believing in God.<br /><br />Stepola is headed to Europe to discover who Styr Magnor really is, and to stop him.  He is also there to make contact with the Christian Underground over there and do what he can to help the European believers.<br /><br />Jerry Jenkins started this \\"Underground Zealot\\" trilogy with a surprisingly good volume in \\"Soon\\".  With the strong start to the series, and no idea where exactly Jenkins is going with it (except, perhaps, the ultimate end of the story), I was looking forward to \\"Silenced\\".  It is written in the typical Jenkins way.  It is very easy to read, and fast paced, but it is also clunky and simplistic in the presentation of the narrative.  Readers of the \\"Left Behind\\" books will know exactly what to expect in the style of writing.  It is so easy to read, and fast paced, that many readers will not be put off by Jenkin's overly simplistic style.  Judging by the sales numbers of \\"Left Behind\\", it may be a fair assessment.<br /><br />My one true complaint is that \\"Silenced\\" took a while to get going with the story.  Sure, the book was as much about Paul's wife Jae's spiritual journey as it was about Paul, but after reading \\"Soon\\", and with the starting premise of this book, I expected more...especially with the subtitle \\"The Wrath of God Descends\\".  There was a lack of God's wrath in this book, which was disappointing.<br /><br />Still, Jerry Jenkins knows how to end a book.  The last third of \\"Silenced\\" was worth the price of admission, at least for someone who enjoys his work.  Not to sound cliche, but the ending actually earns the term \\"explosive\\".  Jenkins builds and builds and just when the reader is tired of the building, he lets it all out and the action truly begins.  It's exciting, and it gets the reader interested in the next volume of the series.  That's a good thing, but it also feels like Jenkins could have done a better job at making the first half to two thirds of the book more interesting and exciting.<br /><br />After \\"Soon\\", it is a bit of a let down, but what an ending.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryg.   <br /> <br />After \\"Soon\\", it is a bit of a let down, but what an ending.   <br /> <br />-Joe Sherry	2004-08-09
US	52402330	RU91LCY9XWKO2	0886776074	190495470	Star of Danger (Darkover)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	another story of culture clash	In &quot;Star of Danger&quot; we get to see one of the earlier works of Marion Zimmer Bradley. First published in 1965, it was the fourth Darkover novel written. The reason this is worth mentioning is that even thought it was only the fourth novel published in the series, it is the twelfth novel in chronological order, and if the &quot;Clingfire Trilogy&quot; is counted (which was mostly written by Deborah J Ross in the years after Bradley died), &quot;Star of Danger&quot; is the fifteenth novel in chronological order. It is in this order that I am experiencing the world of Darkover, from the earliest era of the planet through to the novels that take place deeper in the chronology. Bradley had not yet developed many of the ideas that would encompass the world of Darkover and she had not yet begun to truly tie these novels together. One theme that does remain strong throughout the entire series, including this novel has to do with the clash of cultures.<br /><br /> Larry Montray is a Terran youth who arrives on Darkover for the first time with his father Wade. For years, Larry has dreamt of traveling to distant planets and experiencing alien cultures, but when on Darkover he is not permitted to travel outside the Terran Zone. It is only through disobeying that he is able to maintain a friendship with a young Darkovan native named Kennard Alton. Kennard is a son of the powerful Alton clan on Darkover, a clan which holds much authority on the planet. Even though Larry is forbidden to leave the Terran Zone, he is invited by the Altons to spend several months with the family at their countryside estate. This is a huge opportunity for Terran Intelligence as the ruling class of Darkover is very restrictive regarding who is permitted to roam freely outside the Terran Zone. This is nearly unprecedented access. But to Larry, it is simply the fulfillment of a dream and a chance to spend time with a friend. It is also the beginning of an adventure that risks the lives of both Larry and Kennard, as well as the still tenuous relationship between Darkover and Terra.<br /><br /> Bradley uses this novel, as she does with most of the Darkover series, to explore a culture clash. In this case, it is Larry Montray who is out of his element. Larry is thrust into a situation where everything that he knows is alien to the life he is living on Darkover and he tries to fit in as best that he can. But, the difference of culture also causes conflict in his friendship with Kennard.<br /><br /> &quot;Star of Danger&quot; is a relatively short novel, coming in at just over 200 pages, but it is packed with action and adventure. So much so that one might thing this was geared towards a slightly younger reader, but the storytelling is such that any reader of fantasy can enjoy this book.<br /><br /> My only complaint about &quot;Star of Danger&quot; has to do with continuity, but because this book was written so many years before the rest of the series and Bradley has always been willing to sacrifice continuity if it would help telling a particular story. The continuity issue that I am referring to in this book has to do with Larry's father, Wade Montray. Wade is a minor character, and he did admit to having been on Darkover before, but the text suggests that Wade does not know nearly as much about Darkover as we see in the &quot;Renunciate Trilogy&quot;. It is also surprising that Larry does not know about this, because I would have expected that he would have learned about his father and grandfather's role on Darkover. In particular, I would expect Larry to have known about his grandfather, who had a prominent role in the Terran government on Darkover. Again, since this was written years before the bulk of the series, and with Bradley's willingness to sacrifice continuity for the good of the story, this does not trouble me as much as it otherwise would, but since I am reading the series in chronological order it was a small distraction.<br /><br /> Overall, &quot;Star of Danger&quot; was a short, enjoyable reading experience. I have long been a fan of the Darkover series, which doesn't seem to get nearly as much attention as it should merit. This is good, but not great fantasy (and overlaps with science fiction at times). Most of the Darkover novels can stand alone, and this one certainly does, so it may be a good entrance point into the world of Darkover.<br /><br /> -Joe Sherry>  <br /> Overall, &quot;Star of Danger&quot; was a short, enjoyable reading experience.

Langdon is a Harvard professor and a symbologist. He studies and lectures on religious symbols and is an expert. His assistance is requested when there is a murder in a highly advanced scientific community. While Langdon questions why he is being asked to investigate a murder with no police involvement the reason is clear when the nature of the murder is revealed: burned into the chest of the victim is the symbol for the &quot;Illuminati&quot;. The Illuminati is a secret organization which has its origins in the time of Galileo. The Illuminati were scientists persecuted by the Catholic Church and the organization became rabidly anti-Catholic.<br /><br /> While bringing the Illuminati into the story certainly adds complexity to &quot;Angels and Demons&quot;, the stakes are raised once more when the murder leads to a theft of a small amount of man made anti-matter. This is significant because up until the murder victim, nobody had ever created anti-matter on earth and this is a highly volatile substance that even trace amounts can cause a great explosion. The amount of anti-matter stolen is enough to completely destroy city blocks and with the anti-Catholic nature of the Illuminati, the threat of the stolen anti-matter is directed at the Vatican. This is where Robert Langdon comes in. He has to follow a trail of symbols to stop a series of murders and the eventual destruction of the Vatican itself.<br /><br /> In the hands of a lesser writer, this could be an absurd story that fails to work on any level. Amazingly enough, Dan Brown has written a tight, fast paced story where the tension increases and increases as Langdon tries to unravel the symbols that provide a trail of clues to each potential murder victim and the danger touches the highest levels of the Vatican. &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; should not be as interesting as it turned out to be. This is a book that should be so heavy in detail that it weighs the narrative down, but it doesn't. &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; is a gripping story that pulled me in and did not let me go until near the end when Brown may have used one twist too many and the book finally did venture into the absurd. That one absurdity aside, the 9/10 of this book that worked was so good that I feel compelled to use that grand cliche about literature: &quot;it was a real page turner&quot;. In this case the cliche is absolutely true. &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; is a &quot;real page turner&quot;.<br /><br /> There are many similarities to &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;.

It kicks off the best selling Robot/Foundation series, though when &quot;I, Robot&quot; was first published it was not intended to be a part of any larger series, nor were Robot and Foundation originally connected. While the format of &quot;I, Robot&quot; is loosely a novel, it is truly a collection of short stories that is bridged by a common thread and text that connects all stories together.<br /><br /> The tie that connects these stories together is Susan Calvin, a robopsychologist. At the start of the book, Calvin is retiring from her position at U.S. Robotics. A reporter is trying to get her thoughts on the history of robotics, but not the official position, more of her personal impressions. Calvin was at U.S. Robotics when the first truly &quot;thinking&quot; robots were released for sale and was at the forefront of figuring out why some robots were acting the way they were. The format of &quot;I, Robot&quot; is such that Calvin is essentially giving a little bit of background which moves into the short story, giving an episodic feel to the book.<br /><br /> As the stories move in chronological order, the reader is presented with the evolution of robots, starting with &quot;Robbie&quot;, which deals with the relationship a little girl has with her robot, Robbie. Robbie was designed as a playmate for a little girl and her parents feel that she has become too attached to the robot and has forsaken real friends. Robbie is an earlier design robot: large, clunky, and without the ability to speak. The subsequent stories show the development of robots and include: a mind reading robot, a robot who does not believe it is possible that a human could create a robot, and one that may even end up ruling the world.<br /><br /> Through these stories, Asimov has set up the Three Laws of Robotics, which are:<br /><br /> 1 - A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.<br /><br /> 2 - A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.<br /><br /> 3 - A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.<br /><br /> These Three Laws are the driving force within each of the stories. What is interesting here is that all of the stories are something of a &quot;whodunit&quot;.

Max Brooks gives exhaustive detail on what exactly a zombie is, what weapons to use, and in general just how to survive a zombie attack.  Even though ?The Zombie Survival Guide? is typically catalogued in the ?humor? section of the bookstore, Max Brooks plays this seriously.  At no point in this book is there any impression given that this is not fact and that this topic is one that should be taken very, very seriously.<br /><br />Brooks begins with the how Zombies are created and what it is the causes the reanimation.  Apparently it is a drug/chemical called Solanum.  When Solanum is entered into the blood stream (which can happen from a bite, or from being sprayed by infected blood) it leads to death but the Solanum then causes reanimation into a zombie.  Brooks discusses various facts and misconceptions about zombies.  For example, zombies do not have superhuman strength but what gives the illusion of this strength is that a zombie is unable to feel pain or get tired.<br /><br />Max Brooks moves on to discuss the various weapons that can be used to combat a zombie, and this too is exhaustive.  Included in the discussion are handguns, axes, rifles, assault rifles, flamethrowers, swords, pikes, fire, acid, hammers and many others that fall both inside and outside of these categories.  Brooks discusses the pros and cons of each weapon (and class of weapon), just as one might hope for in an actual survival guide.<br /><br />This volume also contains information about the four classes of zombie attacks which range from an isolated attack to having to live in an undead world.  Anything that the reader can possibly need to know to equip himself (or herself) to survive a zombie attack is contained in this book, and make no mistake, the point of this book is survival at a basic level.<br /><br />The greatest strength of this book is also its greatest flaw: Max Brooks does not wink at the reader or let the reader in on the joke.  As presented, this book is factual (though widespread media coverage has been either suppressed or manipulated) and straightforward.  If zombies attack, this is what you do and how you do it.  The joke, of course, is that there is no such thing as a zombie.  The straight forward zombie survival guide borders on being absolutely brilliant.  The greatest flaw is also the fact that this book is very straight forward and dry reading.  It reads like a manual, but the manual is for something that does not exist.  If zombies really do exist, we?ll all be in for a world of hurt.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryalso its greatest flaw: Max Brooks does not wink at the reader or let the reader in on the joke.

The focus of this play is on Jestus and Dysmas, two con-men.  Jestus and Dysmas were guilty of the murder of Lazarus and they are shocked, and a little relieved, by the reports that Lazarus is still alive.  It doesn't make any sense, because they know they killed him, but Lazarus is alive and this provides the opportunity to get away with the crime.  Not only did they murder Lazarus, but they also stole some of his property.  The play shifts scenes several times and works its way through Jesus' final week.  We are given glimpses of Jesus with his disciples and the Pharisees condemning Jesus.  All of this is building and moving together to that Friday when Jesus is crucified and how this all comes together with Jestus and Dysmas.<br />While it seems that initially the play starts out with a lighter, almost comedic tone in the opening scenes, the power of the story and the impact of what is going on starts to come through.  Barker calls this play \\"a theatrical celebration of Easter week, told through the eyes of the people who were present in Jerusalem at the time.\\"  This play is intended for for production in a worship setting.  This book contains instructions and suggestions for how the play be performed.  The suggestions are along the lines of how to use the cast (written for two men, it can be performed by a larger cast) and brief comments on the staging of the play and props.<br />The potential problem with looking at a play as literature is that a play is ultimately intended to be viewed as a public performance, rather than reading the play privately.  A well written play, however, will allow the reader to be able to visualize the play even though there is nobody performing it.  \\"Cross Purposes\\" is such a play.  I was able to \\"see\\" how this play could be staged and performed and feel the power of what it would be like to be in the audience for a production of \\"Cross Purposes.\\"<br />A note on my bias: I was a student at Northwestern College of Iowa where Jeff Barker is a professor in the theatre department.  I was also a student of Barker's in a playwriting class he taught in the fall of 1999.  I have attended several on campus productions of his work and have always been impressed with the quality of his plays.  Potentially, this has shaded my reading of \\"Cross Purposes\\" to view it favorably, but it is also with the understanding of the quality of work that Jeff Barker produces.  This quality of work begins on the page but stretches through to the direction and production of the play.  I feel that the quality is present in the script and this helps me visualize the quality of the production.<br />-Joe Sherrydience for a production of \\"Cross Purposes.\\"  <br />A note on my bias: I was a student at Northwestern College of Iowa where Jeff Barker is a professor in the theatre department.

While the two series have Franklin W Dixon and Carolyn Keene listed as the authors, neither author actually exists are a person.  They are both creations of the Stratemeyer Syndicate.  The Stratemeyer Syndicate was the \\"writing factory\\" started by Edward Stratemeyer as a means to churn out book after book in a series that he conceived of.  He would contract an author to write a book with the requirement the author sign away all rights to the book and to remain anonymous.  This led to the birth of Franklin W Dixon and Carolyn Keene (as well as the Tom Swift series, among others).<br />This book is the history and evolution of these two iconic series for children.  The reader is shown how society has influenced the content of the novels, both in the language used as well as the plots.  When the Hardy Boys first began in the late 1920's and into the 30's, there early volumes contained numerous racial stereotypes, both among the bad guys as well as the Hardys' friends.  Later editions would edit these stereotypes out.  This book follows the series through their various authors as well as the change in the focus of the Syndicate after the death of Edward Stratemeyer.<br />One thing that the authors of this book try to do is tie both series into the society of the time (whether it is the 1930's of the early series, the 1950's or the 1980's).  This attempt is what I found less successful or interesting about the book.  There are numerous sidebars and pictures and captions about the America's youth during each era and how the books impacted the youth and I felt that this information was extraneous and unnecessary.<br />What is most interesting about this book is the evolution of the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew.  The characters changed over the 75 years and the books continue to sell.  This coverage was the best part of the book and is what I would recommend for the reader.  Nothing would be lost by just skipping the sidebars.

To understand this story, it is necessary to have first read \\"House Atreides\\" and \\"House Harkonnen\\" because the plot lines that started in the first book build to a climax in \\"House Corrino\\".<br />By the time that we get to this novel the former rulers of Ix, House Vernius, had long since been deposed with the last scion of the ruling family living under the protection of his friend, Duke Leto Atreides.  Leto and Rhombur (the last of the Vernius family) are working together to finally reclaim Ix from the Tlielaxu and return Rhombur to power.  Leto's mistress, the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica is pregnant with his child.  Leto wants a son, but the Bene Gesserit need a daughter from Jessica and Leto for their breeding program which is only one generation away from completion.<br />Meanwhile, Shaddam IV, the Emperor of a Million worlds is seeking an alternative to the Spice that runs the Imperium.  Spice is native only to the planet Arrakis and Shaddam wants an artificial source of Spice that he controls.  Shaddam is playing both sides of the game, working to control Arrakis through the planet's overlord Vladimir Harkonnen as well as trying acquire a synthetic spice from the Tlielaxu on Ix.<br />If this sounds complicated, the reason is simple: it is complicated.  Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson are weaving multiple storylines together to build a whole that is far grander than any of the parts.  Brian is the son of the creator of the original 6 book Dune series and he has taken on an ambitious project: to write a prequel series that can complement the original books, expand the universe that Frank Herbert crated, and stand on its own merits.  While different in style and theme than Frank's work, the \\"Prelude to Dune\\" novels are fully a part of the greater \\"Dune\\" universe and are worthy additions to the series.<br />What makes the challenge of writing these novels even tougher is that as a prequel trilogy with characters that we will meet in Frank Herbert's classic (in every sense of the word) novel \\"Dune\\", the authors have to create a story that fits within the continuity of \\"Dune\\" yet is compelling enough of a story to stand alone.

It is in this volume that we are first introduced to Jack Aubrey, a newly made captain in the British Navy.  He is still a young man and eager for his first command.  Aubrey is given command on the H.M.S. Sophie, a much slower ship than Jack had hoped for.  Early in the novel Jack Aubrey meets Stephen Maturin, a surgeon.  They meet at a small concert at a party when Maturin elbows Aubrey in the ribs because Jack was unconsciously conducting the music along with the conductor, and thus annoying Maturin.  Somehow a friendship begins and Jack asks Maturin to join him on the Sophie as the ship's surgeon.  As Maturn is struggling financially and genuinely likes Jack, he accepts.  This begins a great friendship as well as the story of this novel.<br />\\"Master and Commander\\" does not have a plot, in the traditional sense.  It is an in-depth look at life in the British Navy and what life at sea is like, both for the common sailor, but mostly for the Captain.  Patrick O'Brian takes the reader from naval battle to naval battle, through numerous pages on the art of sailing and loads the book up with nautical detail.  There is an incredible level of realism to \\"Master and Commander\\" and the story is well told.<br />There are two ways that this book can be read.  The first is for those with a love of the nautical detail (or those who want to immerse themselves into that level of detail).  The language and detail can be savored, and I'm sure this is what O'Brian intended with the historical accuracy and all the effort that went into creating this novel.  The second way to read this book is for the average reader and this allows for a little bit of skimming and not trying to grasp and fully understand every little detail.  The second reader will probably enjoy the book more this way than should he (or she) try to force through all the detail.  Little, if any, of the story will be missed this way, but it makes the novel easier to digest.  The nautical detail is very heavy and the novel moves at a very slow (though still interesting) pace.<br />-Joe Sherryway, but it makes the novel easier to digest.

With \\"The Paradise Snare\\", author A.C. Crispin brings us the first part of the story of a young Han Solo and shows us what made him into the rogue that we have come to love.  Han starts out working (indentured, it seems) to a criminal named Garris Shrike.  He finally wants out and there is no way that Shrike will let him.  But, with the help and sacrifice of his wookiee friend, Dewlanna, Han is able to escape and find a job as a pilot on the planet Ylesia.<br />On the planet, Han is assigned a bodyguard, Muuurgh, who is as much guarding Han as guarding Ylesia against Han.  Ylesia has a secret that relates to the spice mining it produces.  It is supposedly a religious community which the pilgrims voluntarily work, but Han soon feels that something isn't quite right.  He meets a pilgrim, #923 (we do later learn her name), and starts falling for her and wants to rescue her as well as rescue himself from the soon to be hopeless situation on Ylesia.<br />This book was much better than I expected.  It succeeds at doing several things all at once.  First, and most importantly, it is an entertaining story in its own right.  Second, it starts giving hints and clues and examples of how Han Solo became the man he was in the movies.  He distrusts religion and holds himself back from falling in love.  He is friends with a wookiee. Why?  The set up begins in \\"The Paradise Snare\\".  Third, this book sets up more Han Solo novels in the future (two more books of this trilogy) and makes us wonder how a boy dreaming of being a soldier in the Empire grow up to fight in the Rebellion?  Within the context of Star Wars, this was a good story.<br />-Joe Sherry	2004-07-01

This edition is said to be drastically altered from the original.  What this means, according to the Hardy Boys Unofficial Home Page, is that the text and plot have both been changed.<br />Frank and Joe Hardy become involved in another mystery when their father calls them out west to help with a case.  They are searching for a gang that is involved in robbery, and even on the way out west, they are kidnapped and attacked and it is only with great luck that they even are able to meet up with their father.  They find him hurt badly, but begin the investigation on their own and learn about a mystery about gold that was stolen from a prospector years ago.  Can the brothers keep out of harm's way long enough to solve the case?<br />\\"Hunting for Hidden Gold\\" is another solid offering in the Hardy Boys series, though I would not say this is one of the best.  It is a bit of an adventure story and it gives the sense of really being out west (as opposed to a story set in Bayport).  There is a definite sense of place in this book.  As usual, this book is recommended for kids of all ages (even the 25 year old kid).<br />-Joe Sherry	2004-06-29

It could be as simple as a character taking off his glasses in two shots only seconds apart, or as strange as the odometer in \\"Back to the Future\\" giving different (and impossible) readings in various shots.  This is a book that covers these little flubs in the filmmaking process.<br />The authors' intent is not to point these out to show how bad these movies are, but rather these are the movies the authors love and have seen time and time again and it is these little things that they enjoy catching in movies.  This book is not an exhaustive list of every movie mistake in every movie ever made, but it does cover a large number of movies, from the Matrix to Terminator 2 to Titanic to an old Abbott and Costello movie.  The mistakes are numbered and the time (to the minute, but not second) that the mistake occurs is noted.  The authors note which mistakes are ones that with just a little bit of research could have been avoided and which ones just keep happening over and over again.  The book disproves some alleged mistakes on films, and also makes suggestions on things that do not quite qualify as mistakes, but don't make sense in the context of the film.<br />There is a companion volume out: \\"Oops They did it Again! More Movie Mistakes that Made the Cut\\" which covers more movies than were included in this volume, but this was a good book to see what sort of mistakes were made in the making of some of your favorite movies.

Everyone did.  Most people only knew Lucy as the girl with the face.  Lucy had lost part of her jaw on the right side of her face due to Ewing's Sarcoma as a child.  Lucy was incredibly popular and everyone knew who she was and because they knew her story, they thought they knew Lucy.  Ann Patchett knew of Lucy, but when they were both starting out as graduate students at the Iowa Writer's Workshop, they ended up living together because neither could afford an apartment on her own.  It was the start of an immediate and intense friendship that lasted nearly twenty years.<br />\\"Truth and Beauty\\" is Ann Patchett's first non-fiction work.  She is best known as being the author of \\"Bel Canto\\".  Lucy Grealy was Ann's best friend.  Lucy died in 2002 of an accidental drug overdose.  I imagine that this is a book that never would have been written had Lucy not died, nor could it have been, given the nature of their friendship.  Perhaps because of this, \\"Truth and Beauty\\" is a very powerful book.  It is not quite a memoir, but rather the story of a friendship.  It is neither about Ann nor about Lucy, but is about \\"Ann and Lucy\\".<br />This friendship is one that spanned nearly two decades.  Ann takes us from their first true meeting through Lucy's numerous surgeries (nearly 40 during Lucy's life), through drugs and loneliness, through writer's residency programs and successful book publications, through the end of Lucy's life and Ann's grief.  The only time Ann spends time about their lives apart from each other is only in how the separations were a part of the relationship and what impact they had, and how they kept coming back together.<br />\\"Truth and Beauty\\" is a deeply moving, sad, funny, and beautifully written book.

Frank and Joe frantically look for clues so they can find their friends (not to mention the other mysteries).<br />This is another solid offering in the Hardy Boys Mystery Series.  It is my understanding that the revised edition has been dramatically altered from the original, though it shares the abduction of Chet and Biff.  This is not one of my favorite stories of the series, but like the rest, it is an interesting story and works several different storylines together (my favorites are the ones that can stick with one plotline for the entire book).  \\"The Missing Chums\\" is recommended, like the other books in the series, for children of all ages.<br />-Joe Sherry	2004-06-23

Fleur is legendary within the world Erdrich has created as well as being an iconic character of Erdrich's work as a whole.  \\"Four Souls\\" continues the story of Fleur that was begun in Erdrich's second novel \\"Tracks\\".  Having lost her land to the white developers when Margaret Rushes Bear chose to use the money to save her own son Nector's piece of the land rather than Fleur's, Fleur Pillager walked away from the reservation.  She walked until she was exhausted, and then she kept walking until she reached the Cities.  She stopped, as if she was drawn, in front of a house that was hiring a cleaning woman.  The house belonged to John James Mauser (a family name you should recognize from \\"Tales of Burning Love\\").  Mauser is the developer who purchased Fleur's land and she seeks to exact revenge on Mauser.  Fleur's revenge is not the typical revenge where the person is quickly killed.  No.  Fleur's revenge has Fleur become part of the household so that she can build up Mauser enough that he can sufficiently know what he is going to lose when Fleur decides it is time to take her revenge.<br />The novel is narrated by two characters.  The first is the trickster, Nanapush.  Nanapush tells the story of Fleur as he knows it (at no time is Fleur the narrator the story), so as he tells Fleur's story, he also tells his own.  The other narrator is Polly Elizabeth Gheen.  Polly Elizabeth is the sister of Mauser's wife.  She is able to tell more of the story of Fleur's arrival to the household and what the impact there was.  She also reveals a bit more of her family's history and that of Mauser's history.  In Erdrich's world, everything is interconnected.<br />I have to be upfront in saying that Louise Erdrich has long been my favorite author, and it is with great anticipation that I look forward to the publication of a new novel.  \\"Four Souls\\" did not disappoint me.  Rather than having a simple plot, Louise Erdrich and \\"Four Souls\\" tells a story of Fleur Pillager, of revenge (in many forms), of love, and Erdrich continues to craft out a world that feels very real.  Each volume only serves to add to the richness and the color of The Little No Horse Reservation and the characters which inhabit and intersect with it.

The first book, \\"Left Behind\\" began with the Rapture, where the true believing Christians were taken directly into heaven and the earth was about to begin the great Tribulation as was written about in the Biblical book of Revelation.  Over the course of eleven books, judgment after judgment rained down about the planet as a small (but growing) group of new believers tried to spread the Word of God before it was finally too late.  They also opposed the Anti-Christ that was foretold, Nicolae Carpathia and worked against him to help and save as many as possible.  Book after book gave new judgments (with a literal approach to \\"Revelation\\") and we were being led inexorably to the Glorious Appearing of Jesus.  The series is written by two Christians, and having read one book you know that this is a pro-Christian series, so you know where they are going with the series.  We just don't know exactly how we are going to get there.<br />The first eleven books of the series, leading up to the Glorious Appearing, were bound with a black cover, suggesting the darkness of the state of the world and the judgments of God.  When we finally get to book twelve, titled \\"Glorious Appearing\\", we finally have a white cover.  Don't think this was done by mistake or just by chance.  Finally, with the return of Christ at hand, there will be a light in the darkness that was the Tribulation.  The light of Christ.  It was a subtle decision, but I think it was a fairly clever one.<br />On to the content of the book.  At the end of \\"Armageddon\\" we know that we are so close to the Glorious Appearing.  Either Rayford Steele or Buck Williams died at the end of the previous book and near the beginning of this one we find out which one (I guessed wrong, but I think the clues were misleading).  Other than learning that detail, the first half of the book seems to be in a holding pattern.  There is a little bit of action, but what we're waiting for is Christ's return.<br />Much of the tension of the series has been the fact that we don't know who is going to be alive by the time Jesus actually returns.  I believe that it is stated in the first book that only one out of every four people will be alive.  So, we see the Tribulation Force grow, and have members be cut away as the series progresses.  We know how the series ends, so it is no spoiler to say that the most powerful scenes involve the reunions of the Trib Force with those who had died (or were Raptured).  What is less effective is the lack of dramatic tension in the book, and I guess that there was no choice because of the nature of the series.<br />One of the drawing points of the series, and this book, was wondering just how it is possible to describe an event like the Second Coming of Christ.  Jenkins does a credible, and powerful job at the \\"event\\" but because there wasn't much story to tell in this book, a lot of it feels like filler.  Even much of the action that happened after the Return felt like padding and repetition.  Granted, one of the hallmarks of this series has never been excellent writing, but rather the emotional power of the story, however \\"Glorious Appearing\\" was somewhat of a let down.  It was still a fast paced enjoyable book, but this is the concluding volume of the series and should have left a powerful, satisfying conclusion.  It didn't.  It did leave room for the sequel that Jenkins and LaHaye has planned (something I never understood), and it did wrap up the storylines that were going on for 11 volumes, but it was a series that went out more on a whimper than a bang.<br />-Joe Sherryaction, but what we're waiting for is Christ's return.  <br />Much of the tension of the series has been the fact that we don't know who is going to be alive by the time Jesus actually returns.

The first 38 titles in the series were revised over the course of 15 years (some with minor changes, others were completely re-written).  \\"The Secret of the Old Mill\\" is the third Hardy Boys mystery.<br />Counterfeit money is being passed around Bayport.  Chet Morton, the best friend of the Hardys, makes change of twenty dollars for a stranger and when he tries to purchase a microscope he learns that the bill is counterfeit.  When the boys bring the bill into the police station, they learn that the chief has known about the counterfeits being passed but is keeping it quiet so as to not alert the criminals.  The Hardys start some investigating on their own.  Threats are made to the Hardys telling them to get off the case; but are the threats about the counterfeit case or the secret mystery that their father, Fenton Hardy, is investigating?<br />Reading the Hardy Boys as an adult is a nostalgic pleasure.  I loved these books as a child and remember so much from when I read them years ago.  What makes these books special is that I can enjoy them almost as much now as I did back then.  \\"The Secret of the Old Mill\\" remains a good Hardy Boys mystery and a great story.  It is fast paced and always interesting.  I remember that after I read this book as a child, I started checking all of my money (such as it was) to see if it was counterfeit.  That's the mark of a good story, that it can make a child interested in what is around him and comparing it to what was learned in the book.<br />-Joe Sherry	2004-06-17

When this series began, we met a young boy without a name.  This boy was taken in by the royal house of Buck.  See, this boy was the illegitimate child of one of the princes.  He was given the name FitzChivalry and was trained as an assassin for the king.  Through treachery, the king was slain and the prince that has Fitz's loyalty, Verity, was away on a quest to find they mythical Elderlings to enlist their help against the Red Ship Raiders that have been terrorizing the kingdom.  With Verity gone and King Shrewd now dead, Prince Regal is free to act against, Fitz, whom he has always hated.  At the end of book 2, \\"Royal Assassin\\", Fitz was presumed dead by Regal and buried.  But like it is said in \\"The Princess Bride\\", Fitz was only mostly dead (he took a poison that would simulate death, much like Juliet did in \\"Romeo and Juliet\\").  The story picks up several months later and Fitz is in the care of Burrich, the man who has raised him all these years.  Fitz acts like an animal, for that is what he believes he truly is (for the poison to work, Fitz had to use the \\"Wit\\" magic that has bonded him with a wolf).  Burrich is working to restore Fitz's mind and reflexes to that of a human.<br />Fitz has to recover, or else there will not be much of a story.  When he does, he decides to seek his revenge on Regal and Regal's coterie of Skill users who helped to kill Shrewd and sabotage Buck against the Red Ship Raiders.  The title of \\"Assassin's Quest\\" is especially apt for this book.  Fitz is the titled Assassin, and this novel truly has a quest feel to it, especially as the story progresses.  Every since Verity first started out to find the Elderlings, I have wondered what will become of this quest, and Fitz also seeks to answer this question as well.<br />The Farseer Trilogy is excellent fantasy.  Being told in the first person point of view, it is a change from the typical fantasy novel, and Hobb does not hold anything back.  We know what Fitz can know, so this cannot be a broad sweeping saga.  And yet, this series is not lacking for any depth of storytelling.  Hobb also does not protect her protagonist any.  Horrible, horrible things happen to Fitz throughout the series and that is a part of the raw power here.  The series may be slower moving at times, but that is not for any lack of quality writing on Hobb's part.  Quite the opposite.  The story moves slowly by necessity, but it never fails to be interesting.  \\"Assassin's Quest\\" only serves to make me want more Hobb, and to move on to the \\"Liveship Traders\\" and then onto \\"The Tawny Man\\" series.<br />-Joe Sherryand Hobb does not hold anything back.

This review is of the 1959 revision to \\"The House on the Cliff\\".  Over the course of 15 years, the first 38 Hardy Boys stories were revised to a slightly shorter format with some changes to the original stories.  \\"The House on the Cliff\\" is the second Hardy Boys mystery story.<br />The internationally renowned detective Fenton Hardy has asked his two sons, Frank and Joe, to help him on a case involving the smuggling of rare medical drugs.  The Hardys enlist their friends and spend some time with their telescope looking out over the bay for suspicious activity.  They hear a strange noise coming from the abandoned house, but when they came out they found that the lenses had been stolen from the telescope and the tools taken from their motorcycles.  Something is going on, but does it relate to the smuggling case they are working on?<br />\\"The House on the Cliff\\" is another fast paced Hardy Boys mystery.  It is more of a straightforward story (with twists, of course) than \\"The Tower Treasure\\".  We are introduced to the main mystery right from the start: there are smugglers and the ringleader might be a man named Snattman.  Everything that happens in the book drives towards solving that case.  This was an excellent Hardy Boys mystery.<br />-Joe Sherry	2004-06-15

The brothers discover the disguise the thief must have used.  This leads them to seek help from their father, the famous investigator Fenton Hardy.  Fenton and the boys suspect that there may be a connection to the recent robbery at the Tower mansion where the only suspect is the father of their friend, Slim.  Neither Frank nor Joe believes that Slim's father could have possibly committed the crime and they are committed to clear his name before Slim's family is ruined.<br />I remember when I was much younger and was the age of the target audience of this novel.  I could not get enough of the Hardy Boys and read each of the books several times over.  Reading them a decade and a half later, I can still easily understand my obsession with the stories.  \\"The Tower Treasure\\" is fast paced, interesting, and has a mystery that is begging to be solved (though this is one that can't necessarily be solved by the reader before the brothers solve it).  It is fun to read through the Hardy Boys, and this is a good, clean, young adult adventure story (the series is more adventure than young adult).  I can only hope that when I have children that they will enjoy the Hardy Boys as much as I did.<br />-Joe Sherry	2004-06-11

With the war between the Republic and the Separatists raging all over the galaxy, the Republic has sent out the Jedi to create insurgency on various planets to fight against the Separatists.  The Republic is not used to full scale war and has only a scant clone army compared to the countless droid army of the Separatists.  The Jedi, while powerful, are not soldiers and walk a fine line between the path of the Jedi and that of the Dark Side.  The Jedi Council sent Council member Depa Billiba to Haruun Kal (the birthplanet of Mace Windu) to aid in the battle against the Separatists.<br />Something goes wrong.  The Council receives a message that shows a massacre of civilians (women and children) that is purportedly orchestrated by Depa herself.  This should be unthinkable for a Jedi.  Against the judgment of Chancellor Palpatine, Mace Windu decides to return to his birthplanet and investigate.  You see, Depa Billiba is more than just a Jedi; she was once Mace Windu's Padawan apprentice.  Palpatine wonders if Mace would be able to strike down Depa if the situation calls for it.<br />Mace journeys alone through the jungles of Haruun Kal in search of Depa.  The war that is taking place is one that has been going on for generations (it is, ultimately, a civil war), but with the Clone Wars having begun and the Separatists having interfered, there is a new level of brutality and genocide taking place.  It is into this horror that Windu arrives.<br />\\"Shatterpoint\\" is unlike any Star Wars novel that I have read.  It is much darker (which fits the jungle theme), and it is a violent novel.  It is also a much better written novel than what one might assume with the Star Wars name attached to it.  No matter what universe this story takes place in, \\"Shatterpoint\\" is a very good novel.  It just happens to be Star Wars.  I appreciated the switching of viewpoints between the typical third person storytelling to excerpts of \\"the private journals of Mace Windu\\".  Between the two perspectives, Matthew Stover did an excellent job of storytelling, and both felt appropriate.  While in the movies, Windu has a very limited role (even being a Senior member of the Jedi Council), but \\"Shatterpoint\\" gives Mace Windu a voice and a personality and we get an excellent idea of what sort of man Windu is and what drives him.  We see his strengths and his flaws and he in one novel he is a stronger character than I had possibly imagined him to be.  No longer is Mace the Jedi who is interesting only because he is played in the movies by Samuel Jackson.  He is a character who was given a dark, gritty novel.  \\"Shatterpoint\\" brings the Clone Wars into perspective and shows how it impacts individual planets, what it is going to bring to the Jedi and why, and the difficulty the Republic will have in possibly winning the war.  We even see what it might take and all of this is told in a story about one little planet and a fallen Jedi.  I can only hope that \\"Shatterpoint\\" will be indicative of the quality of the Star Wars novels (past and future), because this is a very good one.<br />-Joe Sherryson storytelling to excerpts of \\"the private journals of Mace Windu\\".

It was presumed there were no survivors and the plane lost.  It was presumed so until Alexis Anders walked back into Thendara unscathed, but without her memory.  Cholayna, the Head of Terran Intelligence on Darkover, called in Magda Lorne to help her figure out what happened.  Magda Lorne, a legend in the Intelligence field, is not simply an intelligence agent, but rather someone who was raised on Darkover from childhood and possesses the \\"laran\\" psi power that would allow Magda to see into Anders' mind and find out what happened to Anders.  Magda is more than an intelligence agent, she is a woman who has \\"gone native\\" and is a member of the Order of Renunciates, an organization that gives women another choice of what they can be in this incredibly patriarchal society.<br />What Lorne finds in the mind of Alexis Anders shouldn't be possible.  By all accounts, there is nothing on the other side of that mountain range.  Nothing.  Satellite photos show nothing, and it is common knowledge on Darkover that nothing can survive over there.  Yet, the mind of Alexis Anders reveals the existence of a hidden city deep in the mountains, a city where there are women of power who are wearing robes.  This may not seem too exceptional (except for a city existing where one shouldn't exist), but from the previous novels which feature Magda Lorne, we know that in a couple of instances using her \\"laran\\" Magda has encountered strange women wearing robes on the spiritual plane who have called themselves the \\"Dark Sisterhood\\".  She originally dismissed this because there was no confirmation that what she thought she saw was real, but with this additional confirmation from Anders, Magda believes there truly is a Dark Sisterhood.<br />When Alexis finally regains her memory, she secretly commissions a guide to find this hidden city.  Magda figures out what is happening and that Alexis is attempting something that she does not truly understand, Magda, along with her freemate Jaelle (another character we are familiar with by this point), and a couple of other women (including Cholayna and Camilla) try to track Alexis before she can find the city (or die trying to find the city).<br />\\"City of Sorcery\\", at its heart, is an adventure story, or perhaps a kind of \\"holy grail\\" story.  The women are all chasing this mythical story, and there are Darkovan legends about this city, but nobody truly believed it could be real.  It becomes something of a holy quest against impossible odds.  This wasn't a story I expected to be that good (my expectation was that this would be one of the weaker Darkover novels), but it was.  This is some excellent storytelling by Marion Zimmer Bradley, and just when she gets to the part of the quest where the story begins to drag, she changes direction and brings it on home and it is fresh and exciting again.  This novel was a surprise for me, but a pleasant one.  The Renunciate trilogy (\\"The Shattered Chain\\", \\"Thendara  House\\") are some of the strongest of the Darkover novels that I have read, and I can only hope that Magda Lorne and the consequences of this quest will appear in the later Darkover novels (or short stories).<br />-Joe Sherrythat Alexis is attempting something that she does not truly understand, Magda, along with her freemate Jaelle (another character we are familiar with by this point), and a couple of other women (including Cholayna and Camilla) try to track Alexis before she can find the city (or die trying to find the city).  <br />\\"City of Sorcery\\", at its heart, is an adventure story, or perhaps a kind of \\"holy grail\\" story.

This is Episode Two in the Star Wars universe.  In writing this novel, R.A. Salvatore had access to the film's screenplay before the movie was ever released (and perhaps even before some scenes had been filmed).  This means that scenes in the novel are likely to be identical (down to the dialogue) to what we see on screen.  This is the responsibility of the author, to be extremely faithful to the source material.  The opportunity that a novel provides the author is giving us additional scenes that were not in the movie, but may help give a broader picture of the story and helps flesh out the characters and their motivations a bit better.  \\"Attack of the Clones\\" is a stronger adaptation because of this.<br />After an assassination attempt on her life, Senator Padme Amidala is put into the protection of the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker.  Padme is the strongest voice against creating a Republic Army and her death could lead the way to the creation of that army.  The attempts on her life continue and Obi-Wan and Anakin now have to split up.  Obi-Wan tracks a bounty hunter to a planet that has been removed from the Jedi Archives.  Anakin is still assigned as Padme's protector and is to take her to her home planet of Naboo.  Anakin still harbors a deep love for Padme that has only grown as the years have gone by.<br />This is a much better adaptation than Terry Brooks' offering of \\"The Phantom Menace\\".  Salvatore was able to take the weak dialogue of George Lucas and work it so that on the printed page the dialogue felt smoother and less forced.  His additional scenes were absolutely pivotal and added emotional weight to the novel and made Anakin's pain (and love) more real.  It did the same for Padme, which was sorely lacking in the film.  This was a worthwhile adaptation and even made me interested in taking a look at Salvatore's other work.	2004-06-04

This is something that was first covered in the feature film version of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", but that film was a complete disappointment and is much different in tone and style than the later, successful, television program of the same name.  \\"The Origin\\" follows creator Joss Whedon's original script and it better matches the tone of the later series.<br />Buffy Summers is a freshman in high school and is the average popular student (think Cordelia in the first season of \\"Buffy\\").  She is self absorbed and does not truly think of others.  This changes when one day an older man comes to her and tells Buffy that she has a destiny, that she is the chosen one, the one girl in all the world called to protect the world, to fight and stop vampires.  In short, Buffy Summers is the Slayer.  We follow Buffy as she encounters her first vampire, tries to deny what she is, and eventually come to begin to accept that she is, in fact, The Slayer.  We see events that are spoken about in the first season of \\"Buffy\\".<br />If you want to see the true first chapter in the story of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", this is the place to start.  Ignore the awful, awful movie with Kristy Swanson in the title role, this is the true origin of Buffy and it is much more faithful to Joss Whedon's vision and it matches the tone and style of the television series.	2004-06-03

This seems to be just a throwaway line in the movie, a tiny bit of detail to provide coloring to the scene.  In the larger Star Wars Universe, we now wonder what it was that Obi-Wan and Anakin were doing.  What was this mission?  \\"The Approaching Storm\\" is the story of this mission to Ansion.<br />Ansion is a small, unimportant planet.  At least, that is how things appear to be on the surface.  In reality, Ansion is a very important planet.  It is tied with treaties and agreements to numerous other nearby planets and this makes the threats that Ansion might secede from the Republic to be very serious.  If Ansion secedes, an entire star system will be pulled with it.  To stop this secession, Chancellor Palpatine requests the Jedi Council send a couple of Jedi to Ansion to find a diplomatic solution to quietly find a way to keep Ansion in the Republic.  The Jedi Council sends Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luminara Unduli, and their Padawan apprentices Anakin Skywalker and Barriss Offee.<br />\\"The Approaching Storm\\" is somewhat of an adventure story.  It is well paced, has humor, some action and some politics.  What I liked best about this novel was the characters of Luminara and Barriss.  We got to see some of their perspective, but I would love to see a novel focus on these two characters.  They provide a perfect counter balance to Anakin and Obi-Wan, and give a greater look at the variety of personalities in the Jedi Order.<br />Alan Dean Foster was the ghostwriter of the first Star Wars novelization, and he wrote the first Extended Universe novel \\"Splinter of the Mind's Eye\\".  His latest Star Wars novel had a great feel to it, and it was so fast paced that I was able to easily finish it in two days.

The website is exactly what it claims to be.  Every day the website posts a new picture related to astronomy with a description of that picture written by a professional astronomer.  With the first archived photo on that website from June 16, 1995, the editors of \\"The Universe: 365 Days\\" had nearly 8 years of photographs to draw on when this volume was published in May 2003.  This book can be used like a calendar because that is how this book is laid out: every day of the year has an astronomy photograph, with a description of each picture.<br />As someone who knows very little about the universe, or astronomy, even with the descriptions next to the pictures I still wasn't always sure what I was looking at and how one picture was truly different from another.  I understand that they look different and that they are pictures of very different parts of the universe, but the details are far beyond my comprehension.  What is not beyond my comprehension is the fact that these are stunningly beautiful pictures.  Even simple pictures that we may have seen many times before, like a picture of our planet from space, is striking and beautiful.  Others are of star clusters and galaxies that are so far away and so alien that it boggles the mind to know that there are places like this out there and we really know nothing about what it would be like to travel there.<br />This book can be read as a calendar, where you flip the page each day and see what new photograph is waiting.  It can be read like that, but I couldn't imagine only looking at one of these pictures a day.  After seeing one picture, I just had to turn the page to see what wonder was waiting for me, and almost without exception, there was a wonder on every page.  Beautiful space photography (though some are on Earth, and others looking out from Earth).  If that sounds interesting, this collection is probably for you.<br />-Joe Sherry	2004-06-02

Anthony Doerr has one of the better stories in the collection, \\"The Shell Collector\\".

Another standout is Ryan Harty's \\"Why the Sky Turns Red when the Sun Goes Down\\", a story of a family with a robotic son (literally, the boy is a robot, or, perhaps an android).  This is a touching story.<br />The best story in the collection, and then one that blew me away is Dan Chaon's \\"The Bees\\".  This one was completely unexpected and shocking.  While this one would probably fall into the category of \\"horror\\", don't let that mislead you.  This one starts out easy, just identifying a man and his family and we start to learn about his past.  He wasn't a good man during his first marriage and he deeply regrets it.  But as the story continues and we get snippets of revelation, the tension grows and so does this air of creepiness that I got while I was reading it.  The tension does not let up until the end of the story, but rather it keeps building because we don't quite know what is going on and this is not what you would assume a typical \\"horror\\" story would be.  It is a psychological horror and it is just gripping.<br />This is a very fine collection, but \\"The Bees\\" was the one story that truly stood out for me and it  continues to be memorable.<br />-Joe Sherryery fine collection, but \\"The Bees\\" was the one story that truly stood out for me and it  continues to be memorable.  <br />-Joe Sherry	2004-06-02

Without question, he is one of the most successful in the World Wrestling Federation (currently World Wrestling Entertainment).  He has sold more merchandise and sold out more arenas than any other WWF/E superstar with the possible exception of Hulk Hogan.  He was that big.  \\"The Stone Cold Truth\\" is his story, told in his own words (or at least in his own voice).<br />Steve Williams takes the reader on the journey of his life, through his days playing high school football in Texas, through college and into his first days as a professional wrestler.  Steve tells the reader, in general terms, what he was thinking and feeling and why he made the decisions he did in his life.  We follow Steve through the indy wrestling feds, through WCW, ECW and finally the WWF.  What is valuable and interesting in this book, other than the easy tone the book takes, is that we get Steve's side of the story in why/how he left WCW, and the story of why he walked out of the WWF following Wrestlemania 18.  We also get his side of the story and his thoughts about having his neck broken in a match against Owen Hart.<br />Every wrestling biography inevitably gets compared to Mick Foley's book, and in comparison, this one does not have the level of detail that Foley provided.  It is a typical WWE autobiography in that there are short, fast moving chapters that give us a sense of who Steve Williams is a person, but not quite giving us the full details (without the glitz) that you might find elsewhere.  Nonetheless, I did get the feeling that Steve was being honest in the details that he provided, and that this is the way that he sees things about his life and career.  This may not be the best wrestling book out on the market, but it's a pretty good one and entertaining.	2004-05-27

What makes it interesting was that \\"The Coil\\" was the sequel \\"Masquerade\\" and followed some of the same characters that we first meet in \\"Masquerade\\".  Knowing who the characters are in the second book changed how I viewed them in the first book. This knowledge actually made things more confusing because things did not at first add up.  \\"Masquerade\\" marked Lynds' first steps into the international spy novel genre, and she gives us a strong, fresh entry.<br />The idea of a character having amnesia and having to figure out who she (or he) is has been done before in the spy genre (most notably with Ludlum's \\"Bourne Identity\\"), but this is the starting point for \\"Masquerade\\".  Liz Sansborough has no memory of who she was or what she did.  All she knows is that a man named Gordon Taite claims to have been her lover and that Liz is a former CIA agent.  Gordon claims to be trying to protect her, and he seems honest, but Liz feels that Gordon is hiding the truth from her.  Can she believe him?  Was she really a CIA agent?  Who is she?<br />With violence and these questions, we are jumpstarted into \\"Masquerade\\".  It would not be hyperbole to say that Gayle Lynds has written a novel that feels like a race to find out who Liz Sansborough is and why these men are trying to kill/capture her.  This is fast paced espionage action with a high body count, and it is an engaging novel all the way through.  It seems like a simple enough story at the beginning, but as Liz learns more about who she is and why she is being hunted, the scope of the story expands in ways the reader never expected (or, in ways I never expected).  Reading \\"The Coil\\" first did not lessen the impact of \\"Masquerade\\" in any way, but rather it added to the challenge of piecing together bits of the story and what I knew about the characters in \\"The Coil\\".  I may not read many espionage novels, but I know an entertaining, well written story when I see one.<br />-Joe Sherryritten story when I see one.  <br />-Joe Sherry	2004-05-24

Rather than setting the events on Candar or Recluse, we are brought to a new location: the island of Nordla.  Kharl is a cooper (he makes barrels) in the city of Brysta.  Kharl is a man of honor and he is compelled to do the right thing.  He does not consider the cost of doing the right thing; he just acts because it is the right thing to do.  Kharl first stops the assault of his neighbor's daughter.  He next rescues a young blackstaffer (an exile from Recluse, they are generally unpopular) and takes her into his home to give her time to rest and heal.  This is over the objections of his wife.  She insists that this will bring them to ruin.  She is right.  These two good deeds set in motion that which will change Kharl's life.<br />When the blackstaffer is found murdered, Kharl is blamed by the authorities.  They know quite well that he had nothing to do with it, but Kharl's earlier good deeds puts him at odds with them.  He is falsely imprisoned and he loses his wife and his children (how he loses his wife and children I will up to the reader to discover).  Kharl must escape Brysta before he loses his life.  He ends up taking a berth on a ship owned by one of his former customers and works as a carpenter for a time.  Kharl also begins learning about his inclination towards Order (which will make sense if you have read other Recluse novels), and who he may really be.<br />\\"Wellspring of Chaos\\" was a good Recluse novel.  For one of the few times (or maybe first) in the series, the main character is a middle aged man rather than a kid going out on his quest.  This changes how Kharl reacts to things and how he thinks, though he still is a bit naïve at times.  As always, \\"Wellspring of Chaos\\" is not substantially different from the other Recluse novels.  They have a similar feel and if I wasn't told that Brysta is in Nordla rather than Candar, I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference.  The good thing is that if you do not try to read the whole series one right after another, this is a good story with a fairly likeable protagonist and is a nice addition to the series.  Similar series of events happen to Kharl that might have happened to any number of protagonists in Recluse, but Modesitt is a solid enough writer that it is easy to get engaged in the story and it doesn't matter what other novels have come before (even if there are 11 previous novels).I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference.

This is a young adult novel aimed at the late elementary/junior high school age.  \\"Snap\\", though written for a younger audience, is just as good as McGhee's full length, adult novels.<br />Edwina Beckey is eleven years old.  She makes lists for everything: herself, her friends, things she likes, her school day.  This is how she makes the world understandable.  She also wears rubber bands on her wrist to remind herself of things she wants to remember (don't tip back on your chair, don't cover your mouth when you laugh), and she snaps them whenever she needs a reminder.  She is friends with Sally Hobart.  When something changes in Sally's life, it changes how Edwina looks at hers and why she makes lists and snaps her rubber bands.<br />Having read McGhee's other novels, it came as no surprise to see how powerful this story was and how real the emotions McGhee describes feel.  This may be a challenging book for a YA reader because of the issues dealt with in the book, but it is a very well written book with believable characters who react in believable ways to the events of the novel.  Like McGhee's other novels, this one is also set near Sterns by the Adirondack Mountains and references are made to characters from her novels.	2004-05-15

The events of \\"Thendara House\\" just happen to be set after those in \\"The Shattered Chain\\" and continue the story introduced in that novel.  This is a novel of the Renunciates, an order of women who have rejected society's role for them and exist as a societal alternative for women.<br />This novel switches between the viewpoints of two characters: Magda Lorne and Jaelle n'ha Melora.  Magda, or Margali as she is called by the Darkovan natives, is of Terran heritage (and is an employee of the Terran Empire), but she was raised on Darkover since she was a child.  During the events of \\"The Shattered Chain\\", Magda took the Oath of the Renunciates under duress when she was trying to rescue her former husband, Peter Haldane.  By the end of that novel, she decided to honor that Oath and came to believe in it.  Thendara House is the chapterhouse of the Order of the Renunciates and Magda is to spend the next six months in training at Thendara learning the ways of the Renunciates.  Jaelle is the Renunciate who took Magda's oath (this is a special relationship).  In order for Magda to be able to fulfill  her obligations, Jaelle agreed to work at the Terran spaceport for the 6 months that Magda is at Thendara.  Magda is also now married to Peter Haldane, Magda's ex-husband.  Peter, like Magda, is a Terran citizen who was raised on Darkover and works for the Empire.<br />Neither woman truly belongs where she is.  Jaelle feels alienation because she is a Darkovan working at the Spaceport and everything she is experiencing is new and different and strange to her.  Her relationship with her husband is also becoming strained as she is still struggling against those gender roles she had thought she left behind when she joined the Renunciates.  Magda knows that she can never truly belong to the Renunciates because she is Terran and, at least for a time, she has to hide who she really is to fit in at all.<br />\\"Thendara House\\" is a more complex novel than it at first seems to be.  Bradley works through the ideas of belonging to a culture and what happens to those cultural transplants which are put into a new and different environment.  She works with the friendships between women and the complex relationships that women can have, both casual and intimate.  \\"Thendara House\\" is the best of the seven Darkover novels that I have read so far and this came as a pleasant surprise to me.<br />-Joe Sherryer truly belong to the Renunciates because she is Terran and, at least for a time, she has to hide who she really is to fit in at all.  <br />\\"Thendara House\\" is a more complex novel than it at first seems to be.

It focuses on the WWE Superstars and gives us a behind-the-scenes look at the Superstars and their lives.  The book is broken up into three sections, each with the focus on a different aspect of the Superstars' life.  In each section, a Superstar gets a two page spread that has photography and something written by the Superstar about his or her life (or career).<br />I wouldn't say that \\"Unscripted\\" is in depth, by any means, but it does gives us descriptions of the lives of the wrestlers that we would not ordinarily have.  For example, Chris Jericho writes about how he does not have an ego about what he does because when he gets home his wife still makes him take out the garbage.  The Undertaker wrote about how he had almost played professional basketball and how he decided to turn to the ring.  Kurt Angle wrote about wrestling in the Olympics with a broken neck and why he did it.  Each wrestler gives a little glimpse into their lives, what they do, and why.  We really just get a glimpse of the wrestling world through the eyes of the wrestlers.  As a fan of the WWE product, I found this to be interesting (if less in depth than, say, Mick Foley's autobiography).  This is a coffee table book, however, so there are many pictures and not too much text.  This is one you can pick up, look at a two page spread, and then put down again to peruse at your leisure.	2004-05-11

He is still seeking revenge against the Duke of Olasko for the slaughter of his people, the Orosoni.  However, because Tal has been trained by the Conclave (Pug, Nakor, etc), he also has obligations to them in addition to seeking his revenge.  Both Tal and the Conclave have similar aims, and Tal's revenge will help the Conclave learn about a magician named Varen.<br />While the existence of the Conclave and their occasional appearances throughout this novel (and the first) give hint to something larger going on than Tal's simple quest for revenge, we never quite find out what the scope of this larger threat is and what the Conclave is truly fighting.  We get glimpses and even a brief mention of something that is potentially interesting (which I don't want to spoil), but the true story follows Tal.<br />Tal has to join the service of the Duke of Olasko to get close to him, to gain his trust, to learn about the magician Varen, and to ultimately get his revenge with Olasko knowing why Tal is getting his revenge.  I thought that this was a well told story (and told better than \\"Talon of the Silver Hawk\\" and while there are more volumes in \\"The Conclave of the Shadows\\" planned, this one actually seems to conclude the story of Tal.  I believe that volume three \\"Exile's Return\\" will focus on an entirely different character, though I'm not positive whom (I have ideas).  This was a good addition to Midkemia and shows that Feist is returning to form and quality.  I'm looking forward to volume 3.	2004-05-04

It is the story of Kambili and her family.  Kambili's father is a powerful force both at home and in the family.  He holds fast to his Catholicism he views anyone who does not follow Christ as firmly as he does as a sinner and doomed to a fiery eternity.  He is not simply the father, but the ruler of the household.  Kambili's father sets a daily schedule for Kambili and her brother, Jaja, that they must follow to the minute and they are commanded to be the best students in their school.  While Jaja has a strength to his character, Kambili is meek and has the sense of being emotionally beaten down, though she has a strong narration throughout the novel.<br />The novel is set in Nigeria and it begins on Palm Sunday with a fight within the family.  Jaja is disobedient to his father and this seems like the beginning where cracks start appearing in the family, but Kambili tells us that the true beginning of this story happens earlier than this.  The second section of the novel is \\"before Palm Sunday\\" and is set an uncertain amount of time before Palm Sunday (at least, I didn't figure out exactly what the timeframe was).  This section traces Kambili's family and extended family as it leads up the Palm Sunday event, and we learn that the fight was not really a beginning, but an ending, that the fight was the result of all of the time before and the changes that were made in Kambili and Jaja, and by extension - to the family.  Section Three is \\"After Palm Sunday\\" and we see the ramifications of that fight and at this point it feels inevitable what happens next.<br />This is a strong, powerful novel, and even though it is set in a location that I have no knowledge of, it is really a novel about a family and a 15 year old girl.  Some things are universal, despite cultural differences.  This story of Kambili and her family is one such thing.  If you put the characters in a different setting (rural America, perhaps), the same story could play out with only a few differences.  This is the power of the story, that knowing nothing of Nigeria, we can understand the story Adichie is spinning., perhaps), the same story could play out with only a few differences.

Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, 1997<br />While I am sure that most people begin a Pulitzer Prize winning novel with excitement about the treasure they are about to read, I begin with a little trepidation.  Will the novel live up to the hype of winning America's most prestigious literary prize?  In several cases I was simply disappointed.  So with that in mind, I began \\"Martin Dressler\\".  The subtitle to this book is \\"The Tale of an American Dreamer\\", and that is exactly what this is.<br />The novel opens near the turn of the 20th century.  Young Martin Dressler works in his father's cigar shop and from a young age he knows the business as well as any grown man.  He suggests the occasional improvement to his father and the customers trust Martin nearly as much as they do Mr. Dressler, and that says something.  Martin dreams of more than simply inheriting the cigar shop.  He dreams grand dreams, of constantly moving up in the world, so when an opportunity arises to take a job at a local hotel, he takes it.  Martin is a hard worker, and more important, he is an excellent worker.  He is promoted several times and it seems as if he is being groomed for some of the top positions in the hotel (the novel jumps forward several years at times throughout the story).  Martin's dreams are bigger than being stuck in the hotel and working for someone else, though, so just when he is about to be promoted even further, he resigns and opens up his own business, a cafeteria.<br />Naturally Martin is a success.  He has been a success at everything that he does.  With every success at business, he takes the business to the next level, expanding the cafeteria and opening a chain of them in the New York area.  He expands even more and buys a hotel and becomes incredibly successful.  With each success, Martin dreams bigger and bigger and he refuses to be satisfied with what he has, and he has a lot.<br />This is the story of Martin's dreams and his pursuit of his dreams, even when he doesn't quite know what he is pursuing.  All Martin knows is that he wants something bigger, better, and grander.  While this puts him on the path to success, it can also be the path to ruin if he does not temper his dreams with reality.<br />I was surprised and impressed with how much I enjoyed reading this book.  It had sat on my bookshelf for several years because I just couldn't make myself start the novel, but when I did, I loved it.  Despite being written in 1997, it felt a little old fashioned, but that fit perfectly to the character of the book.

This is the third novel that features the inept wizard Rincewind as the main character.  \\"Sourcery\\" also marks the first time that I was not bored a Rincewind novel.  Rincewind would like to settle down into his life at the Unseen University, but circumstances will not allow him to.  There is a new threat on the Disc, and this new threat directly threatens wizardry.  This time the threat is a sourcerer.  What, you may ask, is a sourcerer?  If a wizard is the eighth son of an eighth son, a sourcerer is the eighth son of an eighth son of an eighth son.  Or, the eighth son of a wizard.  A wizard, squared.  What makes a sourcerer different is that because he is a wizard squared, he has an immense amount of power that is not bound by the usual strictures of magic.<br />The sourcerer in question here is a twelve year old boy named Coin.  Coin's existence can alter the very fabric of the Discworld and he begins by making changes at the Unseen University and by naming himself Archmage.  Rincewind is thrown into a quest to stop Coin and save the world (again) by, oddly enough, running in the other direction.<br />\\"Sourcery\\" is filled with more humor and sly looks at the world than the previous Rincewind novels and after reading \\"Mort\\" it seems that Pratchett is hiding his stride now.  \\"Sourcery\\", like all of the Discworld novels, is a comic fantasy, and it is rather good.	2004-04-29

While 600 pages can contain a fairly large amount of text, there are many events that can be deemed important enough to be covered in a history of the 20th century.  There are enough events that 600 pages quickly fills up and many things that could be covered in detail can only be glossed over, and some things are only given a passing mention.  This is to be expected.  Every major world event that happened in a 100 year period cannot be adequately covered in a 600 page book (it would take two or three times as many pages to even come close).  What is needed is a filter.  The filter, as I see it, is two-fold.  First, since this book is intended primarily for an American audience, the world events are seen through American (or perhaps just \\"Western\\") eyes.  The events that are covered the most are those that directly impact America.  The second filter is that events are covered that may not directly impact America, but they are so big and so iconic that to dismiss them would be folly.  So, what we do have covered is the American 20th Century, and the biggest world events that indirectly impact America.<br />By no means is this a condemnation of the book.  The topic of the 20th Century is simply too broad to cover every event of importance.  This is not an in depth history, but rather a well written survey of the 20th century.  It is a jumping off point for a reader to find something that is interesting and decide to read more about a given topic (segregation, the Berlin Wall, McCarthyism, etc).  In every chapter, and touching most of the major subjects, there are personal testimonies written by people who actually lived through the events.  This gives a personal look at what could be abstract history.<br />When I finished this book I was glad that I had read it.  I find history surveys interesting because they give the bigger picture of what was going on.

He is the Padawan apprentice to Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Kenobi is no longer the reckless apprentice that he was when he served under Qui-Gon Jinn.  Kenobi has found his center of peace, but Skywalker is even more reckless than perhaps Obi-Wan once was.  Anakin sneaks out of the Jedi temple to seek dangerous races.  The novel opens with one such race (which I still don't quite understand the logistics of), but as the race begins (and Obi-Wan tries to find him), Anakin is attacked by one of the racers, an alien race called a Blood Carver.  This begins an exciting chase that Obi-Wan joins shortly after it begins.<br />Anakin Skywalker has a lot of energy and he is frustrated by the lack of responsibility given him by the Jedi Council.  To channel this energy, the Council sends Obi-Wan and Anakin on a mission to the strange (strange because next to nothing is known about it) planet Zenoma Sekot to investigate the planet's organic spaceships, and also to investigate the disappearance of the Jedi Vergere, who was last heard from on that planet.  At the same time as the Jedi mission to Sekot, we also see Tarkin (a younger version of the Grand Moff Tarkin from \\"A New Hope\\") plotting his own deeds in regards to that planet and we see Tarkin's continuing rise in the Republic (not yet the Empire).<br />For a Star Wars novel, this one was pretty good.  I enjoyed the story, found it interesting and I wanted to know more about Sekot and the battle that occurred on that planet (though I understand this ties in better to the New Jedi Order series that comes much later), and I got to see Anakin develop a little bit more so that I could better understand his anger, his frustration, and how he develops into the man that he does.  Sure, every novel that has Anakin Skywalker as a boy/young man will show shades of the future Darth Vader, but a novel that didn't would seem a little strange, to not hint at it at all.

This is still lighthearted, simplistic fantasy and is fairly enjoyable to read.<br />The Mallorean (and Belgariad) is an epic series of Good vs Evil, Light vs Darkness, and of Gods, Kings, and Men (not to mention women, but I meant humans).  There is magic a plenty, an abundance of sword play, a long epic quest, humor, action, and drama.  One can accuse this series (and Eddings) of telling the same story twice, as the plotlines do follow those of The Belgariad, just in a different location, but Eddings actually built that into the story so well that events are supposed to be repeating themselves.  Rather than blatantly rip himself off, Eddings set up his world and the events in it such that some repetition is necessary.  To be honest, if you are a fan of the Belgariad, you are likely going to have enjoyed reading through the Mallorean.  The ending, though anti-climactic, is nice, pleasant, and a good way to say goodbye to the friends you have made over the course of reading 10 books set in one world dealing with the same set of characters.  They may be clich&eacute; and repeat themselves and tell the same jokes, but these are characters you can come to care for and they are familiar like family.<br />After reading nine novels set in this world, nothing anybody can say will convince you to either like or dislike this book any more than you already will.  The opinion the reader will have of this novel depends entirely on his or her enjoyment of the first 9 books (if one makes it that far).  This is fast reading fantasy, but is enjoyable all the same.

It was given so much so that I was a little unsure about reading it, that it could not possibly live up to the hype.  In one sense, I was right.  The novel did not live up the hype of the critical praise.  However, this is not to say that \\"Life of Pi\\" is not an excellent novel or that it was not a fine piece of literature.<br />This is the story of Piscine Patel, or, Pi as he comes to be called.  Pi is sixteen years old and lives in India.  His father is a zookeeper, but because of the job situation in India the family is leaving and moving to Canada.  Since their zoo is closing, they had to sell the animals to other zoos, some of which are in Canada and they are helping to transport some of the animals before settling in their new country.  Somehow the ship sinks, and Pi ends up on a lifeboat...a lifeboat that he happens to share with a tiger.<br />Can Pi survive?  How does Pi survive?  How can a novel be interesting when the majority of the pages take place with a 16 year old boy on a raft with a tiger?  Surprisingly enough, this is an interesting novel and I actually cared to find out how it all played out.  It was fascinating to see how Pi was able to survive day after day (and not get mauled by the tiger, later named Richard Parker).<br />I don't think \\"Life of Pi\\" is going to make my list of favorite books, but Yann Martel was successful in holding my attention throughout the novel and made me want to keep turning the page to find out what happens next and how it happened.  Good book.	2004-04-23

This one is set back in Ford County, the setting of his first novel \\"A Time to Kill\\", but we also see Clanton, which I believe was the town from \\"The Chamber\\".  I have not been very impressed with Grisham's work when he has strayed away from the legal world, but this novel is a step back in that direction.  To be perfectly honest, Grisham puts one foot back into the legal matters that he has made his career on, but his other foot is in the day to day style of story he told in \\"A Painted House.\\"  This was an excellent blend of Grisham's two literary worlds.<br />The setting is 1970's Mississippi.  Willie Traynor.  Willie is a young reporter for the local newspaper, who, in an interesting set of circumstances, is able to buy the newspaper and become the new owner of the local paper.  For perhaps the first time in one of Grisham's legal novels, the protagonist is not someone who is directly connected to the law.  The future of the paper does not look good.  It was failing quickly (thus Willie was able to purchase the paper), and it doesn't look like Willie has much chance to significantly increase the number of readers...at least not until the brutal rape and murder (committed in front of the victim's children) with the suspect being part of a family with a deservedly poor reputation.  Willie begins reporting every aspect of the case and the trial (and does not hide his bias), sales of the paper begins to soar.<br />We are taken through the trial (and years later when what happened becomes an issue again) through the eyes of Willie Traynor.  Willie began as an outsider to Clanton, but as time passes he becomes an accepted (if colorful) member of Ford County.<br />I have always liked Grisham's legal books, and this one is no different.  While Grisham may never be nominated for the highest literary awards, his books are fast paced and entertaining and fun to read.  That's important, to read something that you enjoy, and I have enjoyed nearly ever book Grisham has put out.  They are similar and follow a formula, but Grisham is good enough (and is maturing as a writer) that for the brief amount of time that it takes to read his book, we are brought into Grisham's world., to read something that you enjoy, and I have enjoyed nearly ever book Grisham has put out.

West Point has a nearly mythological status in American history, and especially in American Military History.  It was founded at the orders of George Washington and among its graduates we can count: Ulysses S Grant, Stonewall Jackson, Robert E Lee, Dwight Eisenhower, Douglas MacArthur, George Patton, and Norman Schwarzkopf.  The purpose of West Point is to take young American civilians and produce fully competent Army officers who are ready to lead men.  Author David Lipsky was given unprecedented access to West Point.  He could go anywhere, anytime and ask any question of anyone.  He stayed at West Point for four years, learning the institution and following the lives of the cadets.  \\"Absolutely American\\" is the story of those four years and it gives us a look into West Point.<br />David Lipsky takes us inside West Point for the four years that a cadet will attend.  We follow the cadets through induction, basic training (a course called \\"The Beast\\"), and through each of their years.  We get to have an inside look at the cadets and how they view their future service in the Army, their hopes and why they enrolled at West Point.  While we only get to scratch the surface of most cadets, it is a fascinating look at these young men and women who are willing to serve our country as officers in the United States Army.  We follow some cadets who are absolutely upstanding soldiers and may very well reach the highest levels of leadership if they make a career out of the Army.  We meet a cadet who at first is an underachiever, but over the course of his four years he grows into a leader.  We also meet several cadets who are just scraping by and we are simply waiting for them to wash out of West Point.<br />One thing that I appreciated about this book is that we actually get to feel what the cadets are going through (as much as possible), and we start to care for them and cheer for their successes and hope that they don't mess up or fail.  By the end of the book, I felt a pride both for West Point as well as the cadets who are succeeding at becoming excellent officers in the Army.  I felt pride in their adherence to honor, duty, service, and loyalty.  I felt pride in their patriotism and their own pride in doing the job as well as they possibly can.  I am glad that these are the caliber of men and women who will be the officers of today and the leaders of tomorrow.<br />No prior knowledge of West Point (or even the military) is necessary for enjoyment of this book.

This one is set shortly after the events of \\"The Spell Sword\\", where Callista had been rescued and the Cat People defeated.  Damon Ridenow is engaged to marry Ellemir, a daughter of the Alton family.  Ellemir's twin sister, Callista, intends on marrying the Terran, Andrew Carr.  This seems simple enough.  Two couples want to get married.  But, this is the basis for the entire novel and the way this plays out is rather interesting.  The trouble is in who these people are.<br />The marriage of Damon and Ellemir is not the problem.  The problem is Andrew and Callista.  You see, Callista is a Keeper of Arilinn Tower.  What this means is that for a woman to become a Keeper there are years of training and conditioning of her senses and her psychic powers and they are honed so tightly that physical contact is almost unbearable, let alone emotional attachment.  Callista may love Andrew very much, but years of conditioning has made her unable to physically respond to him, and should she respond there is the threat of Callista's powers attacking Andrew without her control (part of the conditioning).  They marry, but understand that they cannot consummate the marriage until Callista's conditioning can be undone, and this may take months and years.<br />Meanwhile they are all living at the Alton estate (as would be customary on Darkover).  Andrew is adapting to life on Darkover and is discovering his role in the household and with his new family in friends.  But Andrew still has Terran (think Earth) ways of thinking, and this causes more problems, especially since Damon, Ellemir and Callista are all telepaths, as is Andrew.  The closeness of Darkovan and telepathic relationships is frightening and different to Andrew and he recoils at times causing conflict and confusion.<br />At its heart this novel is a romance, in part between Andrew and Callista, but also between all four of the major characters.  Exactly how that works out would spoil the story, but it is something that is presented as fairly natural on Darkover (though if we judged it by our own standards it would be unusual at best and perhaps deviant at worst).  There is also a major conflict within Darkover's culture because of how the four are viewing their psychic powers and what proper use of them is (there is tradition and laws on Darkover regarding use of \\"laran\\", the psi power.).  This puts the four into direct opposition with the ruling powers of Darkover.<br />While the relationship between Andrew and Callista is at the heart of the novel, the strongest point was (in my view) was the conflict between the four and the rulers of Darkover.  This was the most interesting part and one that I wish was focused on much more than the attempts for Callista and Andrew to finally consummate their marriage.  This was a good Darkover novel, but not one of the best.

The story being told by Lethem is so broad, and at the same time so simple that capturing it in a couple of short paragraphs seems like folly to attempt.  Yet, this novel is so good that an attempt is warranted.  &quot;The Fortress of Solitude&quot; is one of the few novels that I would honestly compare to Don DeLillo's &quot;Underworld&quot;, and Lethem pulls this off in theme, setting, and in the simple power that is conveyed by the story.<br />Most of the novel takes place in 1970's Brooklyn and the story centers on Dylan Ebdus, a young white boy living in a neighborhood of Brooklyn that is predominately black.  Later, when he is in high school it is said that he is one of only three white boys in the entire school.  Yes, race plays a factor in this book.  Dylan is a smaller kid, weak, but he makes a friend in Mingus Rude, a black kid who is new to the neighborhood.  Unlike Dylan, Mingus immediately fits in and finds a place in the neighborhood.  Nobody messes with him.  Mingus belongs.  Dylan and Mingus have one friendship when they are alone and at each other's homes, and another type when they are on the street.  This works for Dylan.  He takes what he can get and he knows that his friendship is the true friendship.<br />Lethem gives us the rhythm of the street and the race relations in that Brooklyn neighborhood.  It is painful for Dylan, but he is able to get by.  What comes next almost seems like a gimmick, but Lethem did not push it down our throat so it felt believable.  Mingus and Dylan are big into comic books and think and talk about superheroes and the powers they have.  Dylan meets a man who was trying unsuccessfully to fly.  At first this seems like an event unconnected to anything else, but it turns out to have a deeper connection to the story.  Sometime later Dylan and Mingus are part of their own two person tagging crew (graffiti) and they tag a homless man who they think is already dead.  At some point later he turns out to be alive and Dylan acquires a ring from the man.  This ring has &quot;super&quot; powers.  Dylan and Mingus attempt to be superheroes, but nothing goes quite according to plan and the ring is put to the side for months and years at a time.<br />As much as the title alludes to Superman comics and that there is a strong comic book theme running through the novel, not to mention the ring, this is a very down to earth novel that just feels real.  Lethem has fashioned the world of the Brooklyn neighborhood and of Dylan's childhood absolutely perfectly.  Lethem is a talented author who just keeps getting better and better.nk is already dead.

FitzChivalry was poisoned by Prince Regal when he was in the Mountain Kingdom to bring home Princess Kettricken.  Kettricken is to wed Fitz's master, King-in-Waiting Verity.  Fitz is battered, both emotionally and physically and it is a long time before he is able to return to Buckkeep and rejoin the royal court.  When Fitz returns to Buckkeep he steps back into his old role as King Shrewd's Assassin, as well as into a new role as Verity's helper in fighting the Forged Ones.  The Forged Ones are citizens of the Kingdom of the Six Duchies who have been captured by the Red Ship Raiders (who have been terrorizing the coast) and turned loose as near zombies who can't think or feel but know only to attack and feed like ghouls.<br />The King is sick.  He is losing strength and Verity's younger brother is plotting both against the King as well as against Verity.  Fitz is doing what he can to protect Verity, but there isn't much that he can do since Regal is a legitimate son and Fitz is only the illegitimate child of a dead Farseer.  Any action Fitz may take can be construed as treason, and he must be careful as Regal already hates him.  In the midst of the plotting and intrigue there is some romance.  Fitz is still in love with a street girl he knew years earlier named Molly.  Molly is now working at the castle as a maid for Princess Patience, and though Fitz knows that this relationship can be used against him by his enemies, he cannot stay away from Molly (once known as Molly Nosebleed).<br />This is a fairly long and deep fantasy novel, but the world that Robin Hobb has created feels real.  Hobb's world is brutal and our favorite characters are spared no pain.  Reading this, I never really knew which characters would live and which would die, even Fitz (you really don't believe he'll die, but Hobb did such a good job with this world that I felt the threat was real).

She is the author of the best selling (and recently a major motion picture) \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\".  Tracy Chevalier seems to write the same sort of novel each time, but because the subjects are different, the ways the novels play out are different.  The technique that Chevalier uses is that she takes a painting that I presume she likes (or is just interested in).  She learns as much of the backstory of the painting as possible and then writes a fictional novel about how this painting came about and who the artist and subjects are.  In the two Chevalier novels I have read now, this has turned out to be much more interesting than it may at first sound.<br />The story in \\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\" is set in 15th Century Paris and Brussels.  Nicolas des Innocents has been commissioned to create a set of tapestries for a minor member of the French nobility Jean Le Viste.  This seems simple enough: Commission, Paint, Weave, Complete.  What sets this novel apart is in the telling.  Nicolas is a talented artist, but rather arrogant about his art.  He mainly paints miniatures in great detail and has never had to design a tapestry (it takes a different sort of skill to design a tapestry).  But Nicolas is also a lusty man.  Months prior he had impregnated a maid at Le Viste's estate and this time he has his eye on a young woman named Claude.  It also seems that Claude has her eye on Nicolas.  There wouldn't be any trouble (or much) if it didn't turn out that Claude is Jean Le Viste's eldest daughter and heir to the estate.  Now any tryst must be secret, but Claude's mother knows something is afoot so she works to keep them apart so Claude may keep her virginity and be an eligible bride with the estate as a dowry.<br />The scene later shifts to the weavers who will actually make the tapestries.  Nicolas defies all custom and is personally involved in nearly all aspects of the making of the tapestries.  He is no less lusty now that he is away from Claude, but we get to see more of his character as this section of the novel progresses.  Throughout the novel we see how Nicolas's inspiration for the tapestry evolves and why he is creating the tapestries quite the way that he is.  We get glimpses into the lives of the weavers, Nicolas, as well as Claude.  This novel is told with multiple narrators in such a way that the shift in narration feels appropriate and smooth and these shifts serve to better advance the story and keep it moving along.<br />The opening of \\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\" felt a little crude with Nicolas's crass sexual interest in Claude, but as the novel wore on there became fewer crass lines and everything felt natural.  For a novel about tapestries (but really about relationships), this one was fairly fast paced.  Considering the quality of both \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" and \\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\", I think I'm going to have to give Chevalier's other two novels a try.

That expression is perhaps a good analogy for Eddings' Mallorean.  Belgarion, Polgara, Belgarath and company are hot on the heels of Zandramas, the sorceress who kidnapped Belgarion's infant son way back in Book 1 \\"Guardians of the West\\".  Now the group is only a couple of days behind, but more than just finding Zandramas they have to follow the prophecy which is gearing up between a final (truly final) meeting between the Child of Light and the Child of Dark.  This story takes place on the continent of Mallorea, and another character is added to Belgarion's group as they follow the clues laid out by prophecy.  While it may feel at times that the story will never end and that Belgarion is not truly getting closer to finding his son, this novel does give the sense that there is a true resolution that is going to happen if we just wait for it.<br />Neither this review nor this book is capable of changing your mind about whether or not you like David Eddings or his work.  If you like Eddings, the \\"Belgariad\\" or the first three books in this series, then you will certainly like this one.  It is more of the same.  If you don't like Eddings...you won't like this one because it is still more of the same.  Every character is witty and makes jokes at the others expense, but in a good natured way because they all like each other.  They are the same jokes and side comments that have run through 8 previous novels set in this world.  On one hand the jokes are amusing, but on the other hand, we've been reading the same jokes and comments for eight novels.  This series (along with \\"The Belgariad\\") is one which hooked me on the fantasy genre when I was a young teenager, so I will always have a certain fondness for the series.  In terms of overall quality, it is not one of the best you will read but it has always been enjoyable to read.	2004-03-26

Max is able to tame these Wild Things by commanding them to be still and so they think that Max is the Wildest Wild Thing of them all.  While I loved this story, the pictures were also somewhat scary and areis capable of frightening a child.  If there really were monsters under my bed when I was a kid, I always imagined that they looked liked the Wild Things.  It is hard to believe that this book has been around for forty years, but when I read it again when I was 25 I think I enjoyed it just as much as when I was 6.  This is a great story, though parents should consider what sort of things frighten their children.	2004-03-26

I have long considered the photography in National Geographic to be some of the best magazine photography that I have seen.  The images are typically stunning and give me a visual idea of locations that I would not even be able to imagine.  I cannot speak to the technical craft of photography because I know nothing about that.  Since I also have not looked at other National Geographic Collections, I cannot speak as to what is included in those collections and how it compares to this collection.  What I can speak to is what I thought about this particular collection.<br />Bottom line: I liked it.  Since I am not a regular reader of National Geographic, all of the pictures were new to me.  This is an excellent collection of photography for someone who just wants to look at some wonderful pictures.  One can look through the book casually and enjoy the pictures (as I did), or one can study the pictures and see exactly what is going on and find nuance within the pictures.  Either way works.  Good pictures, good book, and it was an enjoyable time looking at some of the best of National Geographic's photography.	2004-03-24

She has previously written the Pulitzer Prize winning short story collection \\"The Interpreter of Maladies\\".  This is the story of immigrants from India and is also the story of their son, Gogol Ganguli.<br />Ashoke and Ashima are married in India in a marriage arranged by their parents (as is the custom).  Just after the wedding they travel to America where Ashoke is first a student at MIT, then later a professor.  While Ashoke is able to feel a connection to this new country (he starkly remembers an older friend saying that his one mistake was leaving American to return to India), Ashima feels her immigrant status keenly.  She holds to the ways of the Bengali and when their son is born they want to name him in the old manner: the grandmother will send a letter with his Good Name.  A Good Name is that which is the official name on record and is used publicly and professionally.  The private name is that which is only used among family and friends.  But this is America and the child may not be releases from a hospital without a name on the birth certificate.  The parents decide to name their son Gogol, after the Russian author Nikolai Gogol who, in a roundabout way, was instrumental in saving the life of Ashoke when he was a young man.  They never intended this to be his Good Name and they waited for the letter from the grandmother to come, but it never does and so right up until Gogol is ready to go to kindergarten the only name he has is Gogol.  When Gogol is to enroll in kindergarten his parents give him the Good Name of Nikhil and try to force both Gogol and the school to use it, but he refuses and so does the school.  His name is Gogol.<br />I stressed this part of the novel because it raises a rather large theme within the novel: that of identity.

This novel takes place approximately five years after \\"Masquerade\\", and Liz Sansborough is now a college professor teaching out in California.  She is a former CIA agent who was deemed far too compromised as an agent to ever be allowed to return.  Liz is the daughter of the notorious assassin, The Carnivore, and it is because of this connection that she was unable to return to the CIA.<br />Liz teaches a course on the psychology of violence and now views violence as one of the great evils of society and that violence should be avoided at all costs, even in self defense.  This is who Liz is, but the novel opens with Liz's friend, Sarah Walker, being kidnapped while on vacation and Sarah's husband being shot during the kidnapping.  The kidnapper tells Asher (Sarah's husband) to get The Carnivore's files.  At the same time this is happening, Liz is attacked and almost killed when she is out running.  Liz is eventually contacted by the CIA to help them find her father's files and to save Sarah.  This pushes Liz across two continents in a race to find the files before the kidnappers and to rescue Sarah Walker.<br />The first thing that I appreciated about this novel is that it wasn't necessary to have read \\"Masquerade\\" to understand who Liz Sansborough is or what is going on.  Gayle Lynds does an excellent job in setting up the story that all the necessary background is provided in a way that does not feel like it is just dropped into the novel in a big chunk.  Rather, the background info is revealed to us in bits and pieces in such a manner that it is appropriate to the story that is being told.  Another thing that I liked was how fast paced the story was.  I have not read many espionage novels, but the image of what they were like was dispelled by \\"The Coil\\".  This story moved!  There are enough twists and turns to keep the reader guessing, and I was never entirely sure where the story was going.  Lynds also kept the body count high enough that I didn't know who was going to live and who was going to die, and this kept up the tension and suspense.  Not having read any of Gayle Lynds' work, I had no idea what to expect going into \\"The Coil.\\"  I was pleasantly surprised.  One of the higher compliments I can give is by saying that \\"The Coil\\" was good enough that it made me want to read her other novels (specifically \\"Masquerade\\").d!

This one is set sometime after the Terran Empire rediscovered Darkover.  Now there are both the Darkovan natives, as well as men from Terra living on Darkover.  This novel begins in a way that we have seen several times before: with a crash of a Terran vehicle on Darkover.  This time it is from a team based at the Terran outpost at Thendara.  Andrew Carr is a member of the Mapping and Explorations team that is slowly gathering information about Darkover.  In a winter storm, the plane crashed and it was only through what Andrew thought was a hallucination that he was able to survive for very long in the storm.  Andrew had visions of a woman named Callista guiding him away from the plane and to safety, but he had difficulty believing that these visions might be true.  Eventually, Carr does come to accept that the vision is more than a hallucination, but someone communicating with him.<br />Damon Ridenow has been called to help find Callista, who has gone missing without a trace.  Before Damon arrives at Callista's home he has to travel through someplace called \\"the darkened land\\" where the land is in shadows, uninhabitable and attacks can come from invisible assailants.  Not a place you would want to spend much time.  After passing through \\"the darkened land\\", Damon learns more about Callista's abduction and also meets Andrew Carr who was led there somehow by the vision of Callista.  When Andrew and Damon discuss what has happened, they see the connection and that the only way to save Callista is by working together.  Damon is surprised to discover that Andrew, a Terran, also has the potential to be a telepath, which Damon believed was a skill native to Darkover.<br />Throughout the Darkover series we hear that there are non-human races on the planet: the chieri and the cat-people.  While we see the chieri once or twice, we have never seen the cat-people before and this was an area that I was interested in.  For the most part, they are not developed as a race or as characters, except that we now know that some can be telepaths like humans (and chieri).  We also know that they are mainly enemies of humans (though they have worked with the less reputable humans from the Dry Towns), though Damon does allow that their motives and culture are so far removed from human that it would be difficult to truly comprehend it.<br />This is a short novel, coming in less than 200 pages, but I found it to be fairly entertaining and I suspect that it sets the stage for the much longer \\"The Forbidden Tower\\" which features many of the same characters.  \\"The Spell Sword\\" serves as introduction to Andrew Carr, Damon Ridenow, and Callista.

It picks up the story of her life after \\"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\\" and begins when she is 17 years old and the mother of her son, Guy.  Marguerite (her proper name) knows that she has to find a job so she can support herself and her son.  This book covers several jobs in several cities and is an amazingly powerful look at her life.<br />What I know of Maya Angelou is that she is a celebrated author who has written volumes of poetry and autobiography and that she seems to be a friend and favorite guest of Oprah Winfrey.  The woman she is now, from all that I can tell, is a beautiful soul.  What I didn't know was the experiences of her life and how she came to be the woman she is.  These series of autobiographies tell of Angelou's life and the reality far surpasses anything I could have imagined.<br />In this volume alone Maya worked as a dancer, a cook (multiple times), a Madam, a waitress, and briefly as a prostitute.  The power comes in the how, the why, and in the telling of the story of these jobs and in Maya's raising of her son and interactions with her family, co-workers, false friends, and with men.<br />Each volume of Maya Angelou's autobiography is fairly slim (this one was 181 pages), but the life she has lived is so fascinating that I would highly recommend reading it (any of them).  It will not take up much of your time, but it shows the life of a young woman growing up and living a life uncommon.	2004-03-11
US	52402330	RKK9ZK2X0IB49	0345434110	241741985	Star Wars, Episode I: The Phantom Menace	Books	3	0	3	N	N	kind of boring	Author Terry Brooks was given the task to write the book adaptation of the first Star Wars prequel movie: \\"The Phantom Menace\\".  The novel is based on the screenplay by George Lucas.  As with any other book there are good things and bad things about this novel.  In this case, the good and the bad are the same thing: Terry Brooks must stay close to George Lucas's screenplay.  This is good because Brooks must stay close to what the movie would end up being.  This is bad because the screenplay wasn't very good.<br />The story is obviously the same as the movie (though fleshed out a little bit more).  Two Jedi are sent to negotiate with the Trade Federation over the Federation's blockade of Naboo.  The Neimoidians, under the power of Darth Sidious, try to kill the Jedi (Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi).  The Jedi escape and travel down to Naboo where they end up rescuing Queen Amidala and a few select Nubians.  To hide from the Trade Federation they land on the planet Tatooine where they meet a boy named Anakin Skywalker.  Their ship is damaged and to get the parts they need Anakin helps them win something called a podrace, which Anakin is a driver in (the only human who is able to do so).  Qui-Gon believes this boy is strong in the Force and is the one mentioned in a prophecy about a boy who will bring balance to the Force.  The novel has two primary focuses: the time spend on Tatooine with Anakin and freeing the Naboo from the Trade Federation.<br />There are some things that this novel does very well.  The opening of the novel is different from the movie in that we see Anakin in the podrace where he is wrecked by Sebulba (alluded to in the film).  We see how Anakin is able to race the pod so well and this is the hint of how he is able to use the Force even without knowing what it is.  Because we have more of Anakin's thoughts, we see his actions in a different light.  We also get to see more of the Sith and their origins (though I prefer \\"Shadow Hunter\\" for that).  Darth Maul does not come off very well in this novel.  He is still an excellent fighter, but he doesn't get to speak or think here.  The two Jedi come off the strongest as we get to see more interaction between the two and with more explanation of their relationship.<br />There are also some things that do not work very well.  While Anakin is better explained as the potential child of prophecy, he is still not very interesting as a character.  Also, both Darth Maul and Padme Amidala are given short shrift in characterization.  Worse, I was bored throughout the novel.  Sure, I knew the story so there were no surprises, but I can re-read a book or watch a movie a second or fifth time and still be entertained.  With this novel I felt that I was just dragging myself along and the only benefit was that I did already know the story so I could skim at times.  I have long been a fan of Terry Brooks and his Shannara novels, but this one was rather weak..  Darth Maul does not come off very well in this novel.

US	52402330	R1UYWMO33FLD49	0965718107	677600174	Stuttering: Science, Therapy & Practice	Books	4	4	4	N	N	a reference work	The front cover of this book describes itself as the \\"most complete book about stuttering\\", and in one sense that is a correct assessment.  Thomas Kehoe has pulled together an enormous amount of research about stuttering and put it into a 300 page book.  This is the book's greatest strength, but it can also be a weakness.  The reader should know what he is reading this book for and what he hopes to get out of it so he knows what to expect.<br />The book is broken up into three sections: Science, Therapy, and Practice, and the focus of each section is how each relates to stuttering and stuttering therapy.  The book follows the idea of \\"the more you know, the better off you are\\" and with that in mind Thomas Kehoe collects all the research he can find about stuttering, breaks it out into organized sections and drops it all in the book.  Kehoe does not draw conclusions from any of the research (though he does say what worked for him and what didn't).  Kehoe takes a subject and shows all of the research on it, even if one bit of research disputes what is said by another.  This is good because we can see how there are no pat answers in regards to stuttering and we need to figure out what will work best for each individual stutterer, but it also becomes frustrating because of the sheer volume of information contained in this book without a conclusion being drawn.  The reader is left to fend for himself to try to figure out what he wants to do and how to go about it.<br />The greatest benefit of this book, I believe, is as a reference work.  Kehoe references many other books on stuttering as well as internet sites and places to go to work through stuttering.  There is a value in the book, but please do not go into this book expecting a direct answer on how to work on your stuttering.	2004-03-04

I cannot help but see Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling and it is the voice of Anthony Hopkins I hear when Hannibal Lecter speaks.  While this may limit how I view the characters, this does not detract at all from the book and I feel that in many ways, the novel is superior and is still gripping despite my familiarity with the story.<br />Clarice Starling is in training at the FBI Academy.  She is a star student in the Behavioral Sciences Division when the Department Chief, Jack Crawford, calls her into his office and gives her a job.  She is to interview one Dr Hannibal \\"The Cannibal\\" Lecter in order to help get into the mind of a serial killer.  There is an open case with a serial killer who has been nicknamed \\"Buffalo Bill\\", and Dr. Lecter may be the only chance to solve the case without there being many more murders.  Starling is only a trainee, and this may be why Lecter is actually willing to speak to Starling about Buffalo Bill, though he is always holding something back.<br />Lecter is a villain of extreme intellect and this comes through in his dialogue.  Like \\"Red Dragon\\", Dr. Lecter is not the central villain and the story does not revolve specifically around him (though he has a larger role this time around).  Lecter does play a pivotal role because without him, the story cannot move forward.  We never truly get into the psyche of Jame Gumb (not as much as we did with Frances Dolorhyde in \\"Red Dragon\\"), and it seems as if most of his actions happen off camera.<br />While Lecter is a very interesting character, it is Clarice Starling that we get to see grow as a character and become more confident and insistent in her work with Lecter and to catch \\"Buffalo Bill\\" even though she is only a trainee.  She was put on this case and she intends to see it through.<br />As creepy as the movie could be, I loved this book.  It had a very fast pace and stayed interesting throughout the story and it didn't matter that I had seen the movie multiple times.  I was interested in the story Thomas Harris was telling.  While Harris goes into detail about crimes, it doesn't feel very gory or unnecessary.  It seems that this novel was a best seller in the late 80's and it is easy to see why.  \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" is a well told thriller and any fans of James Patterson and that genre should definitely give this one a look.as the movie could be, I loved this book.

The setting is on Coruscant just days before the event of \\"The Phantom Menace\\".  Whereas \\"Cloak of Deception\\" was a novel set on a grander scale and told of the origins of Darth Sidious's plan for the Naboo trade blockade and dealt with political intrigue, \\"Shadow Hunter\\" is a fairly straight-forward action ride of a novel.<br />One of the Neimoidians who was instrumental in setting up the Naboo blockade has gone missing.  Nate Gunray suspects that Hath Monchar is betraying the other Neimoidians and Darth Sidious knows that there is a betrayal even though Gunray has said nothing about this.  To track down Monchar, Darth Sidious has sent his apprentice Darth Maul to find Monchar, kill him and kill anybody Monchar has spoken to about the upcoming blockade.  Monchar has contacted a criminal named Lorn Pavan about selling this information.  With Pavan we meet his droid, I-Five.<br />While this is going on Jedi Padawan Darsha Assant is sent on her final test before becoming a Jedi.  She must escort someone back to the Jedi Temple, but while her mission initially seems unrelated to the other storyline in the novel the mission becomes complicated and eventually intertwines with the lives of Darth Maul and Lorn Pavan.<br />This is a very fast paced novel, and one in which we get to see a different side of the Star Wars universe: namely, the Sith.  Darth Maul becomes a more interesting character as we learn a little bit more about his background and that of the Sith and part of a reason why there are only two Sith at a time.  After the exposition, \\"Shadow Hunter\\" is non-stop and everything is constantly moving, driving the story forward.  I was pleasantly surprised with this Star Wars novel.  It was a well told story (as far as Star Wars goes) with lots of action, some light saber action and a deeper look at the Sith.  It was good enough that it made me want to continue on with the Star Wars novels.

Like her debut novel, ?Children of God Go Bowling? features a protagonist who is also named Shannon Olson.  Shannon is a very likable character (though a bit neurotic) and is fairly funny in what she observes about other people (as well as her comments about things).<br />Shannon Olson is now in her 30?s, she is still single and is not doing well on the dating scene (such as it is).  Shannon has been in therapy for years, but it still unsure about herself in many ways.  In part, this may be because of her relationship with her mother, Flo.  In a way, this novel is like a funnier, less neurotic ?Cathy? (the comic strip).  It is filled with interesting, memorable characters and was a joy to read.  While I can?t say that I liked this one quite as much as ?Welcome to My Planet?, this was a nice light-weight, funny novel that rises above the mini-genre of ?chick lit?.

It was written by the then husband and wife team of Michael Dorris (\\"A Yellow Raft in Blue Water\\") and Louise Erdrich (\\"Love Medicine\\").  \\"Route Two\\" is a travel memoir of their trip west from New Hampshire to Washington along Route Two.  The insides of the book covers have a map of the United States with the path of their trip highlighted in yellow.<br />Route Two runs along the northern border of the United States near Canada.  Erdrich and Dorris describe the road as being fairly desolate, but with a definite beauty.  It is open country with the road passing through towns and regions that most people will never see.  Erdrich and Dorris describe little bits of their trip (you measure time by how many different license plates you see, by how many news broadcasts are on the radio) in both the driving and in the locations that they stopped.  Louise Erdrich and Michael Dorris succeed in making what is in all likelihood a very lonely stretch of highway across the country in to being a road that has a history and a personality that is inviting.  This may be a slim volume, but I found it to be a very interesting one.  The hardcover edition of \\"Route Two\\" is rather rare, however, with only 275 numbered and autographed editions available (as well as 26 lettered editions).	2004-03-01

Now, how much do you actually know about what went on?  From the Big Bang to the creation of our planet to human life, there are many things that had to happen in order for it to all come out the way that it did.  Bill Bryson started out with the understanding that he knew very little about this planet and how everything works.  Since Bryson could barely read the science textbooks from his youth (they were that boring), he decided to go to the experts in various fields of study to find out what they knew about the universe and our planet and just as importantly, how they know what they know.  The result is this book.<br />Bill Bryson takes us on a journey starting with the origins of the universe and what science knows about it and how scientists have come to this knowledge.  Bryson tells us about what we need to know to understand the larger concepts in this book but does not go into such minute detail that we are overwhelmed.  Bryson combines a smooth, easy writing style with wit and humor and presents us with the story of our planet.  Bryson takes us from the dawn of the Big Bang through primordial life on Earth through the evolution of the species right up into the beginnings of human civilization.  The story is well told with scientific information but also with the stories of the scientists themselves and the circumstances of their lives and how they came to discover the previously hidden secrets of our planet.  While the paragraphs on the scientists may seem like digression, I found it to be vital to the book because this reveals how and why scientists believe what they do and what theories have been discarded and what sort of struggle there was for a particular theory to be accepted.<br />\\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\" is a fairly long book and comes in at approximately 500 pages in hardcover format.  It is packed with a lot of information, though in a highly readable form.  The book is an investment in time, but I think that it is a time investment well worth making (despite the fact that by the end of the book I had a difficult time remembering things from the beginning of it).

This is an environmental work in that the aim of the book is to educate about some of the beautiful regions of our country and to tell that there is a significant human threat to the environment.  Kingsolver writes passionately about how the human settlement and human wastefulness is cause further destruction of the environment.  The photography in this book is broken up not into regions of the country, but types of ecological regions: wetlands, forest areas, etc.<br />The photography by Annie Griffith Belt is absolutely beautiful.  There are two types of photography.  The first type is black and white infrared photography that has been hand colored.  These pictures look like paintings, and while pretty, I was not as interested in these pictures.  The photographs that I found to be stunning were the simple color pictures.  We get to see beautiful landscapes that would make a very nice postcard.  These are images that make a strong case that these are places we need to preserve.<br />I should state that I do not know anything about photography, so I cannot speak for the craft of taking pictures and how well the photographs come out as technical pieces.  I just enjoyed the photography.<br />My suggestion is that one should look at this book for the beautiful photography and not for Kingsolver's section introductions.  However, if someone is interested in reading that these are beautiful places that are being ruined by a human cause, by all means, read the text in this book.  Barbara Kingsolver is a wonderful writer, but when she has a cause and is writing non-fiction, she is not nearly as interesting as she is in her fiction.  This book is worth looking at for the color photography.	2004-02-12

Perhaps it is, but most men (or maybe just me) do not come ready made with the knowledge of what it takes to plan a wedding or how to best be helpful in that process.  This book is for the average guy who wants to be able to help (rather than hinder) the planning of his wedding.<br />This book has detail about each part of the planning process (from engagement through honeymoon) and lets the guy know what he needs to do, what he should do, and where he should step out of the way.  This book has a bit more detail in some places than the more entertaining (though equally informative) book \\"The Clueless Groom's Guide\\", so I would consider this one (as well as the previously mentioned book) to be essential groom's guides and invaluable to the average guy who only knows that he should be standing up at the alter waiting for his wife to be to walk down the aisle.  This book is worth the time to borrow from the library and it is worth the money to purchase.  Either way, you can't go wrong with this book.	2004-02-10

This book is different from most of the stuttering books that I have found.  What is different about this book is that it is not a technical book about the details and mechanics of stuttering, nor is it a book that will necessarily help with treatment.  This book opens with 25 stories of stutterers.  Kenneth St. Louis made a decision to only tell the stories of people who have had a measure of success and acceptance in how they deal with stuttering.  Many of the stories felt familiar to me because I had gone through similar things in my life or their thoughts were those that I have had in the past.  What is nice about these stories are that they are from ordinary people (Bruce Willis and James Earl Jones are not included in this collection) who have to deal with stuttering in their daily lives and they let us know how they have dealt with it.  Some have not had any treatment and they just accept the fact that they stutter and do not let it bother them or hold them back.  Others have had to work at their stuttering.  The end point these stories are trying to drive home is that while you may never be completely free from stuttering, it is possible to have success in treating stuttering.<br />The second portion of the book (less than half) deals with stuttering itself.  It reveals what stuttering is (and what it is not).  It goes through some of the more common treatments, and tells what the benefits of some of the treatments can be.  This is not a book that will help you treat yourself, but it can point you in the right direction if you are looking for a place to start.  There are also references in the back of the book that someone may find helpful.<br />This is an easy book to read, and if a person is looking for a book on stuttering, this may be a good one to look at as it includes personal testimonies in addition to the details of stuttering.  It is a simple book, but it should be a good one to start with on the topic of stuttering.hould be a good one to start with on the topic of stuttering.	2004-02-09

We witness an event that Moiraine will later allude to in the main series 20 years later: Gitara's foretelling that the Dragon has been reborn.  It is the event that the Aes Sedai have been waiting for and dreading.  This will become Moiraine's mission in life, to find the boy who will grow up to be the Dragon and to keep him safe until the Last Battle.  This novel is filled with details about the White Tower that we never got a chance to see before.  The time Moiraine and Siuan spend as Accepted is much different that what we later see with Egwene and Elayne.  We are given glimpses of what the White Tower was really like before the Dragon is reborn and before Rand's existence changes everything.  We even get to see a little bit of the inner workings of the Blue Ajah.  This novel begins Moiraine's quest to find Rand (though she will not know it is Rand for another 15-20 years) before the Dark One can.<br />I know that I did not describe the basic plot of the book very well, but this is the sort of novel that even though it is a prequel and is set years before the events of Book 1, it is really directed at those who have already read the main series.  Starting the Wheel of Time with \\"New Spring\\" destroys the sense of mystery and questioning that we get in \\"The Eye of the World\\" because \\"New Spring\\" already opens up the scope of the world while \\"The Eye of the World\\" slowly unfolds what we know about Rand, and what we know of Aes Sedai.  \\"New Spring\\" seems to assume that we already are familiar with the characters and the concepts presented here.<br />I understand there are complaints because Robert Jordan took the time to write a prequel novel rather than continuing on with his main series that we hope he will finish before he dies.  That is a valid complaint, but it doesn't address something very important: was \\"New Spring\\" a good book and did it entertain?  The answer for me is yes.  \\"New Spring\\" reminds me of part of the reason why I first started to enjoy the Wheel of Time series and also reassures me that the man is capable of writing a novel that is relatively shorter and tightly paced.  He can, and he did, and I hope that he does it again.  While I am still waiting for book eleven, this was an excellent diversion from the main series and was Jordan's best book in some time.ning that we get in \\"The Eye of the World\\" because \\"New Spring\\" already opens up the scope of the world while \\"The Eye of the World\\" slowly unfolds what we know about Rand, and what we know of Aes Sedai.  \\"New Spring\\" seems to assume that we already are familiar with the characters and the concepts presented here.  <br />I understand there are complaints because Robert Jordan took the time to write a prequel novel rather than continuing on with his main series that we hope he will finish before he dies.

To give a quick recap of what has happened before, this novel is set in the 18th Century, but one that is no longer recognizable as the 18th Century.  Isaac Newton discovered something called philosopher's mercury, a substance that has allowed science to go into a entirely new direction and it truly did change the world.  The heroes of our story are Ben Franklin, who is the apprentice of Isaac Newton, and Adrienne, a brilliant scientists struggling with the societal strictures of being a woman.  Two years prior to \\"A Calculus of Angels\\" someone had called down a comet and destroyed London completely.  There are forces in the world that are similar to Angels or Demons (depending on how you are looking at it) called the Malakim.  They are part of the hidden powers that are permitting these wonderous scientific devices.<br />This brings us to the second novel (more or less).  France no longer has a central authority after the death of Louis XIV.  Tsar Peter the Great, of Russia, is marching his armies East to build an Empire.  A delegation from the American Colonies is sailing to Europe to discover what happened (after the Comet hit, there were natural disasters and all contact with the continent ceased), and the delegation includes Cotton Mather, Blackbeard the Pirate, and a Choctaw named Red Shoes.  Ben Franklin is in Prague trying to defend the city from an attack similar to the one that destroyed London, and he no longer trusts Isaac Newton.  Adrienne is learning more of the Malakim and her journey takes her across Europe in into the circle of powerful men.<br />This is a difficult book to really describe because it is so complex.  The series begun with a true history of our world, but with one event (Newton's discovery), it changed the entire landscape so that even while real men and women are in the novel, they are in entirely new situations that will shape the characters in ways that we could never have expected.  While I enjoyed the first book, I feel this novel is where the series really begins to pick up.  I had to force myself to keep going at times in \\"Newton's Cannon\\", but here I just wanted to keep reading to see what happens next (and also to figure out exactly what is really going on here).  Greg Keyes does an excellent job of building this world and the strange twist on our own.

US	52402330	RFOM6TU54QCKW	0345456440	212094948	Legends II: New Short Novels by the Masters of Modern Fantasy	Books	5	40	43	N	N	Legends is one of the best fantasy collections	In 1998 Robert Silverberg edited a collection of fantasy stories titled \\"Legends\\".  That collection included stories by some of the best and most popular fantasy authors of the time (Robert Jordan, Raymond Feist, Stephen King, George Martin, etc).  It was one of the best collections I had read, and allowed me to revisit some familiar worlds and discover some brand new ones.  Legends II is the second collection by Robert Silverberg and it is just as good as the first collection.  There are some authors that did not return for this collection (Robert Jordan, Stephen King, Terry Pratchett), some that returned (Raymond Feist, George Martin, Robert Silverberg, Anne McCaffrey), and some that are making their first appearance in Legends (Terry Brooks, Robin Hobb, Neil Gaiman, Elizabeth Haydon).  These stories are all mostly of high quality, and if you are looking for an excellent sampling of talented and popular fantasy authors, this is the volume for you.<br />What I like best about the Legends collections is that they give me the chance to revisit some of my favorite authors and see their worlds from a different perspective than that which is presented in their novels.  Raymond Feist returns to Midkemia with a story set during the Riftwar.  \\"The Messenger\\" is a story of the messengers who bring the military orders from one commander to another, risking their lives in the process.  Some minor characters from the novels make an appearance, and some major ones are mentioned, and though this has a simple storyline, this is a well told story.  George Martin continues the story of Dunk and Egg that he began in the first Legends.  \\"The Sworn Sword\\" is one of my favorite stories in the collection and it is set approximately a hundred years before \\"A Game of Thrones\\".  I haven't read one of Orson Scott Card's \\"Alvin Maker\\" novels in years, but I have thoroughly enjoyed both of the Alvin Maker stories that have been in the Legends collections.  \\"The Yazoo Queen\\" continues the story of Alvin, and this time mixes in characters like Abraham Lincoln and Jim Bowie (yes, it is appropriate to the story, and yes, it does work).  Reading \\"The Yazoo Queen\\" makes me want to go back and start reading the series anew.<br />I was surprised by the appearance of Neil Gaiman in this collection, but I can't say that I am disappointed.  He takes the character of Shadow, from \\"American Gods\\" and tells a story that occurs two years after that novel.  \\"The Monarch of the Glen\\" is set in Scotland, and while this isn't my favorite of the collection, it was a nice interlude until we get the sequel to \\"American Gods.\\"  Robin Hobb's story is set in the world of the Liveship Traders (more so than the regions of the Farseer).  As I have not read the Liveship trilogy, I don't really know how that story connects to the main series, but Hobb's talent is undeniable.  \\"Homecoming\\" is written as if it was the travel journal of a passenger on a boat who initially thinks that they are on a ship to help set up a colony of the Cursed Shores, but as the story continues, she discovers more about why she is there and then what this new land is like.  The story that I was most looking forward to in this collection was \\"Indomitable\\", by Terry Brooks.  Set two years after \\"The Wishsong of Shannara\\", this story follows Jair Ohmsford after he is visited by Kimber Boh telling him that Cogline believes that Brin somehow missed a page when she destroyed the Ildatch.  While it was very nice to return to these characters, this story ended up being a little bit of a let down and anti-climactic (despite the action packed ending).  I've always been a big fan of Shannara, but somehow this story felt rushed.<br />There are also several authors whom I had heard of, but had not yet read any of their work.  I'll start with the editor of this collection, Robert Silverberg.  He returns to the world of Majipoor with \\"The Book of Changes\\".  This story is set in the early history of the gigantic world ofMajipoor.  I don't know how this relates to the series as a whole, and while it did not make me want to rush out and start reading the Majipoor novels, if I ever start to run low on new fantasy novels to read, I may give Majipoor a chance.  This is also the first time I have read anything by Elizabeth Haydon and her \\"Symphony of Ages\\" series.  This story is one of the best of the collection and focuses on the destruction of Serendair and the men who were the last defenders of the city.  I'm sure this ties in somehow into the larger series, and this story is good enough that \\"Rhapsody\\" will be placed on my future reading list.  Tad Williams also makes an appearance in this collection, telling a story of \\"Otherland\\".  \\"The Happiest Dead Boy in the World\\" is a story of Orlando Gardiner who had died of a debilitating illness but is able to live on in the Otherland computer simulated worlds.  Since I have not read the Otherland novels, I don't know if knowing that Orlando died spoils anything or not.  I thought the ideas presented in this story were fascinating, and I am definitely going to read \\"Otherland\\" now.<br />This leaves me with two stories left unmentioned.  I saved them for last simply because I thought they were rather bad, though for different reasons.  The first is by Diana Gabaldon.  Her story of \\"Lord John and the Succubus\\" did absolutely nothing for me, except bore me.  I was not able to get interested in any of the characters of this story, nor did I care what happened.  I've not read any of Gabaldon's novels, but then I have not read Tad Williams or Elizabeth Haydon before, either.  This story just did not work for me.  The last story to mention is by Anne McCaffrey and is set on the world of Pern.  The Pern novels have long been some of my favorites, which is why I hate to say that this wasn't a good story.  \\"Beyond Between\\" tells of what happens when a dragon (and rider) go Between, but never return.  \\"Between\\" is that place where the dragon goes while it is teleporting from location to location.  It is icy cold, and it is death when the dragon fails to return.  While, I suppose I have always been interested in what happens Between, I've never wanted a story about it.  I'm not even sure the story should have been told as some things are best left to the reader's imagination.  The other problem with this story is who it is about: Moreta.  Readers of the Pern series will know that Moreta was a legendary Queen Rider who died when she exhausted herself and the dragon so much trying to deliver medicine to halt a plague that she failed to return from Between.  Her death was a huge sacrifice and a powerful moment in that novel (as well as Pern's history, as a song was made of it).  This story nullifies that power and that sacrifice and removes the importance of the event because it changes how we view what happened.  As she is already dead, a story of Moreta's further adventures was simply disappointing both as a Pern story, as well as just being a story that was not terribly interesting despite my love of Pern.<br />With the exceptions of the two stories which I did not like, this was a fantastic collection and if anyone is looking for a new fantasy author to read and doesn't want to experiment with an entire novel, this collection is the place to look.  I can only hope that Robert Silverberg will edit another Legends collection.of Majipoor.

I prefer the novel length format so I can spend more time with the characters that I have come to know and short stories tend to cut me off just when I want to learn more about a character or a situation.  But, this collection came highly recommended to me and there is a blurb on the back cover from Alison McGhee (Rainlight) comparing Daniel Stolar's stories to those of Jhumpa Lahiri (Pulitzer Prize winning author of \\"The Interpreter of Maladies\\").  With the recommendation and a blurb from an author I admire, I was willing to give this collection a chance and I'm glad that I did.<br />This is Daniel Stolar's debut collection and it is superb.  There are eight stories, and they share common themes and characteristics.  Almost all of them are set in the St. Louis area (or the characters are from St. Louis), and they deal with the themes of loss, friendship, trying to fit in, and love.  There is not a weak story in the collection, but there are some that I found to be more memorable than the others.  The first is the first story of the collection \\"Jack Landers is My Friend\\", which deals with Jack returning to his high school reunion and reconnecting with his friend, the beautiful Kara.  As Stolar tells the story, we are shown glimpses of the past, enough to show us exactly how Jack came to be at this place in his life.  Actually, that is another common thread that runs through these stories: the past and present are weaved together so well that the story is stronger and you can't imagine it being told without the flashback.  Another standout story is \\"Crossing Over\\" which has a white college student pledging to a black fraternity.  I didn't expect to like this one because of the topic, but it ended up being a highlight of the collection.<br />This is a collection that I very much wanted to like, but my expectations and my hopes were far exceeded by just how good these stories are.  I don't know if Mr. Stolar is at work on another collection, or even on a novel, but I am already looking forward to whatever he publishes next.  One thing that I should mention about this collection is that these are not upbeat or cheerful stories.  Even though I liked each of the stories, I needed to take a break in between stories, there was that much emotional power contained here.  But every time I took a break, I was looking forward to starting the next story.  That's the mark of a good storyteller: one who leaves you wanting more.on another collection, or even on a novel, but I am already looking forward to whatever he publishes next.

It is not a fiction book, nor is it really a non-fiction book.  \\"The Dancing Mind\\" is a speech Toni Morrison gave when she accepted The National Book Foundation Medal.  This is a very slim volume, coming in at only 17 pages, but it is an opportunity to read something that I never would have encountered anywhere else.<br />Toni Morrison gave two unrelated anecdotes, but tied them together at the end of the speech.  The first was a story of a young man from an affluent family.  He grew up being forced to read certain book and participate in certain activities, and when he was finally out of school, he had no inclination to ever read another book.  The only experience of reading he had was for an assignment and for a grade, and never for pleasure. The second story was of a woman writer and approached her, telling Morrison of the difficulty of writing honest literature while living in a country that would suppress literature.<br />The only connection between the two is that the both deal with books, one from the reader's perspective, the other from the author's.  Morrison combines these two into a brief discussion on the necessity of reading and writing, and the enjoyment that can be found from each, and how these are necessary despite (or perhaps, because) of how much of an industry books has become.<br />This is such a short speech that it won't take up much time to read it, and I think I heard the cadences of Morrison's speaking voice while reading the text.  I would imagine that hearing Morrison give the speech would be a superior experience over reading it, but I'm glad that I read it.  This is an acceptance speech, but it gives an insight into the mind of Toni Morrison.	2004-01-22

It is also the first time she has permitted a co-author into the Pern universe: her son, Todd.  This time McCaffrey tells the story of an earlier time in Perns history.  The time is more than halfway through the second Interval, 16 years before the next Threadfall and the next pass of the Red Star.  We are several hundred years before the events in Moreta: Dragonlady of Pern and perhaps a hundred years from the events of Dragonseye.  So, this is the time period we are looking at.<br />The story is set in the Natalon mining camp, and this is one of the first times weve had a look at the miners.  This is the story of Kindan, a twelve year old boy who seemed older when I read the book.  Kindan does not expect anything more out of his life than to follow his father into the mines when he is old enough.  All of this changes when there is an accident at the mine and Kindans father and brothers are all killed.  He is left an orphan and he is taken in by the Masterharper, Zist.<br />What the title of this book refers to is the watch whers (they appear in several of the Pern novels).  The watch whers are dragon like, though smaller and nocturnal, and are used typically as a nighttime guard or as the first warning if anything is going wrong.  They are kin to dragons (hence the title) from when humans first settled on Pern.  Watch whers play a prominent role in this book (though, the watch wher egg does not appear until close to half way through the book).<br />At times, Dragons Kin did not feel like a Pern novel.  Dragons play such a limited role, and this story is such a sub-set off of what became the primary storyline throughout Pern.  This was a quick reading story, but none of the characters were as engaging as previous characters.  There is no Menolly, or Lessa, or Flar, or Jaxom, or even any of the characters from Dragonsdawn.  Kindan is too young, and while he may grow into a better character (assuming McCaffrey follows up with these characters), he isnt interesting enough to build a novel around.  The minor character, Nuella, she has potential.  Dragons Kin is a decent enough Pern novel, but it is nothing to get excited about.racters from Dragonsdawn.

While the information in this book is presented in a humorous way and Van Dijk uses some fairly ridiculous examples, there is also quite a lot of information that is necessary and useful.  Van Dijk just makes the book entertaining enough to read that the stereotypical guy is willing to keep reading to get to the good stuff.  That's one point that I think I have to make up front.  The examples given and some of the descriptions provided describe the groom as the stereotypical man.  Most men probably won't fall fully into that category, but it is entertaining reading.<br />This book takes men step by step through the entire wedding process, from buying the ring right up to the honeymoon.  In each chapter, there are valuable tips to be gained.  For example, if you read the chapter on buying the ring you will learn what the most common styles are and what style of cut and setting you should avoid at all costs unless you know for a fact that style is exactly what your girlfriend wants.  Granted, most men will probably not be reading this book until they are already engaged and their fianc&eacute; recommends (or buys) this book for them.  That's how I acquired my copy.  But, there is still a plethora of other useful information available.  Here's another for example: the author strongly recommends against using a videographer, though he does give a list of things to look for and ask about should you decide to use one.<br />As the groom-to-be goes through the pre-wedding process, this is a book that he should refer back to and flip through the relevant sections.  As I get closer to my own wedding, I am certainly going to be looking back at this book.  It was entertaining to read, as well as honestly informative.  It may seem a little silly at times, but this book is definitely worth your money.	2004-01-19

Typically, I have not really enjoyed Grisham's novels when he strayed from the world of lawyers and courtrooms.  \\"A Painted House\\" was okay, but I thought \\"Skipping Christmas\\" was just awful.  But, since Grisham has been entertaining me for so many years now, I am willing to give a chance to any book he writes.  I didn't have any expectations going into \\"Bleachers\\", and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.<br />The town of Messina is a southern football town.  It is a town where high school football is king, and the players are all royalty.  The townsfolk remember every every win, every loss, and perhaps every play.  The star players are celebrities in Messina, and the former coach, Eddie Rake, is just short of being a god.  Eddie Rake is a legend in Messina.  He came in as a 28 year old coach, and in one year he turned the football program around and created a legacy and tradition of winning state titles.  Now he is dying and his former football players return to Messina.<br />The protagonist of this book is Neely Crenshaw, a former star Quarterback who hasn't been back to Messina since they retired his old number the year after he graduated.  He is filled with resentment towards Rake, but he cannot stay away for the funeral.  A group of former players gather in the stands a couple of nights before Rake actually dies and they talk about their lives, football, Coach Rake, and as the story goes on Grisham is examining the characters of these men, and how football and Coach Rake has affected their lives.  It is a simple story, but unlike Grisham's other non-legal stories, this one was fascinating and I wanted to keep reading.  It is a short book, but it is a good one.  I doubt this novel will win any awards, but it was a fun, entertaining read.	2004-01-19
US	52402330	R38Q8CQI1IKLNR	0375409440	311140684	Love	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Toni Morrison succeeds again!	I have only read one other novel by Toni Morrison, the Pulitzer winning \\"Beloved\\".  That is a high standard for any novel to be compared to, but as I started reading \\"Love\\" I forgot about anything else and was wrapped up in Morrison's prose.  This is not the sort of novel I was able to read with anything distracting in the background.  I had to turn off the radio and whatever tv was playing and focus on the book in the quiet, and with each successive chapter, I was enraptured by the book.<br />This is the story of many things, the most prominent being love.  Rather than blandly stating that one character loves another, Morrison spends time developing the relationships between various characters and the different way their loves take shape.  This is not all romantic love.  We have the love between a husband and a wife, a father and a daughter, lust between teenagers, and various shadings of each.  The central figure in this novel is Bill Cosey, a former hotel owner, now deceased.  We are given perspectives from Heed, Vida, Christine, Junior, L, Celestial, May, Romen, and Sandler, and together, these characters create a beautiful novel.  This is not so much a case of Morrison telling a single story than it is Morrison revealing characters and creating a little section of our world that feels real by the time she is done.  Toni Morrison truly is one of the most powerful voices in American Fiction.	2004-01-15

This story is about the Order of Free Amazons.  Darkover society is very restrictive towards women and women have few rights; and in some cases no rights to speak of.  The Free Amazons reject that attitude and by law, any member of the Free Amazons does not have to submit to the rule of men.  Rather, they are held accountable by the Charter of the Free Amazons for their actions and to the Guild to which they belong.  They represent another option for women who feel the oppression of Darkovan society (some do not feel the oppression).<br />The novel is broken out into three sections, each focusing on a different character, though the same cast of characters moves in and out of the stories being told in each section.  The first section focuses on the lady Rohana Ardais.  Before the novel begins, Lady Rohana is given information that a kinswoman who had been kidnapped more than a decade ago is still alive and that she wants to be rescued for the sake of her children.  Rohana defies convention, hires out a team of Free Amazons, and sets out to rescue Melora from the Dry Towns.  This rescue results in Melora's daughter, Jaelle, being fostered by the Free Amazons.  There is a twelve year interval between section one and section two.<br />Section two focuses on a Terran named Magda Lorne, and again, there is someone who needs rescuing.  This time it is her former husband, also a Terran.  Both are Terran agents working out of the spaceport at Thendara.  Since they were raised in a Darkovan city, they are able to work undercover, learning the languages and the changes in language and style and culture to better assist the Terrans to interact with the natives of Darkover.  Magda's ex-husband, Peter, seems to look identical to a relative of Rohana's, and with Rohana's suggestion, Magda disguises herself as a Free Amazon to negotiate the release of Peter.<br />Section three features a grown Jaelle.  Jaelle met up with Magda during section two, and is a leader of a small band of Free Amazons.  But she is still young, and has not yet known love and does have the experience to know if she will regret her decision to become a Free Amazon.  This becomes the central conflict of the third section, after the action of section two.<br />Ultimately, this is a novel that looks at the gender roles in Darkovan society and how there is one segment of society that works outside the typical roles of women.  The Free Amazons will also be a very important society in the relations between Darkover and the Terran Empire.<br />This is one of the better Darkover novels.  With the three section structure, Bradley was able to pack the detail and story and emotion into a tighter form, and the novel is stronger because of that.  Each of the three women (Rohana, Magda, and Jaelle) are characters that I want to know more about, they are well written and interesting, and this is an excellent chapter in the world of Darkover.st the Terrans to interact with the natives of Darkover.

US	52402330	R37YCEAIA761MU	0375826688	342317933	Eragon (Inheritance)	Books	5	5	9	N	N	a wonderful debut from a young author	This is the debut novel from Christopher Paolini.  Paolini graduated high school when he was 15 and started work on a novel.  When he was 17, \\"Eragon\\" was published by Knopf and the book landed at the top of bestsellers lists across the country.  This would be a good first novel for anyone, but as this is the debut novel from a teenager, I think we have just been put on notice that a major new talent has arrived.  This was quite a good novel, and Paolini will only get better as he ages and refines his craft.<br />This is, at its core, a simple and fairly typical fantasy story.  A fifteen year old boy lives in an isolated village in the mountains.  One day while exploring he comes across a blue gem.  Selling this gem will help get enough money for his family to have enough to eat for some time, but nobody knows quite what it is worth and the regular traders do not want to fleece young Eragon.  The stone turns out to not be a gem, but rather an egg, a dragon egg to be exact.  When the dragon is born, Eragon decides to raise it, and learns that dragons are very intelligent and powerful creatures.  There were once Dragon Riders in the land, but the evil King Galbatroix, a former Rider himself and with the help of rogue Riders, hunted down the Riders and slaughtered them.  Now there are no Riders left.  Galbatroix knows that the egg is out there and he is sending his forces out to reclaim the egg/ and the new Rider, Eragon.<br />\\"Eragon\\" is reminiscent of the fantasy of Tolkien, Anne McCaffrey, Terry Brooks, and several other fantasy authors.  It is similar, but Paolini tells his story well enough, and makes it interesting enough, that it doesn't really matter.  Paolini was able to hold my interest well enough that I am looking forward to the second book in the \\"Inheritance\\" trilogy and I am glad that I finally got around to giving \\"Eragon\\" a try.  It was a fun book to read, and was rather fast paced.  I also understand that it is primarily marketed for the teenaged audience, but then again Harry Potter is supposed to be a children's story.audience, but then again Harry Potter is supposed to be a children's story.	2004-01-09

This novel is set before the events of \\"The Phanton Menace\\" and set some things in motion which help better explain potential questions raised in the movie.  Some questions that get addressed in this book: \\"What is the deal with the Trade Federation?\\", \\"Why is Chancellor Valorum ineffective as the leader of the Senate?\\", \\"How does the Senator from such a small planet has such influence in the Senate?\\".<br />We are in the waning days of the Galactic Republic.  The Trade Federation has an absurd amount of power, influencing the Senate and maintaining control over trade lanes.  They are, in effect, a Galactic Monopoly.  Few in the Senate are willing to deal with this growing problem, but there are bands of terrorists attacking the Trade Federation in the Outer Rim.  Members of the Trade Federation have entered into an alliance with a mysterious figure only known as Darth Sidious.<br />The Jedi-Knight Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi get involved in one of the terrorist attacks and sensing a larger problem that is worth getting involved in, Qui-Gon defies the Jedi Council and continues to work to find the root of the terrorist problem and the Trade Federation.  Qui-Gon also foils an assassination attempt on Chancellor Valorum, and the implications of this event are far reaching.<br />I did not have very high expectations regarding this book.  I have not heard very many good things about the quality of the Star Wars novels.  The beginning of this novel was moderately weak as I didn't find any of the characters to be engaging at all (despite my familiarity with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan).  They seemed to be simply acting, and Luceno was not very successful in revealing who these men, women, and aliens were.  About halfway through the novel, the story picked up a bit and I was able to get into it a bit more, and I enjoyed the book more than when I began.  It was good enough that I'm willing to try a few more Star Wars novels and try to work my way through the series for a while longer so that I can see what happens after the events of \\"The Return of the Jedi\\".  This isn't a great book, but it's not bad.

US	52402330	RT8KH599T21HK	039915079X	700072898	The Teeth of the Tiger (Jack Ryan Novels)	Books	4	4	10	N	N	a huge improvement over "Red Rabbit"	Tom Clancy's newest novel set in the Ryanverse (the Jack Ryan universe) is a departure from each of the preceding novels.  The difference is that the focus is no longer on Jack Ryan or John Clark.  When we last saw Jack Ryan in \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\", he was the President of the United States.  Jack Ryan is no longer President, though it is not clear if he served out his term or if he resigned after the murder of his best friend, Vice President Robbie Jackson (I am assuming you have read the previous novels, if not, I apologize for that spoiler).  John Clark is still the head of the Rainbow anti-terrorism group, which is as much as \\"The Teeth of the Tiger\\" tells us about Clark.  Jack Ryan does not appear in this novel, but rather he is only referred to.  The same goes for John Clark.  The focus of this novel is on three men.  Two men are brothers, Dominic and Brian Caruso, nephews of Jack Ryan.  The other man is Jack Ryan, Jr, the son of the former president.<br />There is an organization known only as \\"The Campus\\".  The Campus is a secret organization set up by former President Ryan with the purpose of countering terrorism.  The Campus is authorized to take the initiative to act against terrorists without the oversight of Congress or the government.  Officially, the Campus does not exist.  There are covert CIA operations that are considered \\"black\\" operations that do not officially exist but still exist in the framework of the CIA.  The Campus does not exist.  There is no government funding or unofficial acceptance, and only a small handful of people outside The Campus know that it exists.<br />The Campus is recruiting new operatives.  The Caruso twins are from the FBI and the Marines and are rising stars in their respective jobs.  The Campus recruits them, and trains them, and though they still officially work for the FBI and the Marine Corps, they have a new role in defending America from its enemies.  Jack Ryan, Jr has recruited himself when he figures out the Campus is something other than what it seems and he is hired as an analyst (similar to what Jack Ryan, Sr's role was for the CIA, only lower ranking).<br />While Clancy spends time establishing the Campus and our new protagonists, he also builds the actions of the potential terrorists, setting up their large scale attack (exactly what it is, I will not spoil).  While Clancy tends to present things as a case of black and white, good guys and bad guys, he does a good job of establishing what is going to happen even as he uses an abundance of detail.  As the time gets closer to the event, Clancy's writing seems to speed up with shorter sections in each chapter with snippets revealing events unfolding.  The second half of the novel is the reaction to the event.<br />There is good, and there is bad in this novel.  I felt that one particular section involved large scale coincidence, but other than that, I was okay with what all went down.  Clancy builds us up, releases with some action (making this book so much more satisfying than \\"Red Rabbit\\"), and continues with the novel.  I understand that Tom Clancy admitted in an interview that he was only going to write two more novels in the Ryanverse.  \\"Red Rabbit\\" was the first (the interview was before the publication of \\"Red Rabbit\\"), and that would make \\"The Teeth of the Tiger\\" the last Ryanverse novel.  The problem with that is that this book felt like a bit of setup for future novels featuring Jack Ryan, Jr, and the Caruso twins.  There is also still room in the universe for another book, perhaps featuring Ding Chavez.  The only problem with this is that \\"The Teeth of the Tiger\\" is presumably set either in the present day, or somewhat in the future.  Clancy would have to slow down his pace of writing if he intends to keep novels in the present or just in the future, otherwise he will then enter into a speculative future if he continues the series with an aging Jack Ryan, Jr.<br />The bottom line is that I enjoyed this book much more than \\"Red Rabbit,\\" and I appreciated that it was a slimmer volume (after the thousand page \\"Bear and the Dragon\\") for a change.  There was less depth in this book, but it was an entertaining read and a nice return to quality for Tom Clancy.  I can only hope that he continues with this series and finishes his return to form.this book much more than \\"Red Rabbit,\\" and I appreciated that it was a slimmer volume (after the thousand page \\"Bear and the Dragon\\") for a change.

Picking up right where \\"King of the Murgos\\" left off, Garion and company (Belgarath, Polgara, Sadi. C'Nedra, Silk, etc) head off to the continent/Empire of Mallorea under the power of the Emperor Zakath.  This seems to be a side trip as they are trying to get to The House of Torak at Ashaba, but the group keeps getting sidetracked.  However, as Belgarath says in the book, even with all the distractions, they keep gaining ground and time on Zandramas.  That fact is no different in this novel.<br />While in the capital city of MaL Zeth, reports start coming in about a sorcerer who is raising a legion of demons.  While the quest for Garion's son is important, a legion of demons threatens all and must be addressed.  Add to this a touch of plague to the city, and Zakath's refusal to let Garion leave, and you have the makings of this novel.  Like the other books of this series, it is a familiar story that mirrors that of The Belgariad (the first series involving these characters).<br />I would consider this to be light fantasy, but because of how well Eddings writes his characters, they feel like old friends from the start, and it is easy to get wrapped up in the story.  This is also the 8th book featuring these characters, however, and we are getting the same story over and over again, so that there is really nothing new here.  Silk acts like he always does, and says the same things, and Polgara responds the same way.  If this is your first time through the series, and you have enjoyed it thus far, you will continue to enjoy it.  After reading it multiple times, it begins to grow a little tiresome because of how similar everything David Eddings writes is to each other.  This is a fun little series that I greatly enjoyed years ago, and less so today.	2004-01-06

Tolkien's Lord of the Rings	Books	4	2	4	N	N	a fun parody	\\"Bored of the Rings\\", as you can imagine, is a parody of Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\".  It was originally written in the late 60's, so some of the material is a little bit dated,  but it still remains funny for those very familiar with Tolkien and some pop culture from the 60's.  One thing to note is that if you have not read \\"Lord of the Rings\\", you will almost certainly miss most (if not all) of the jokes in this book and should take a pass on this volume until you have read LOTR.<br />This book features the adventure of Goodgulf the Wizard, and the boggies Frito, Spam, Moxie, and Pepsi.  We also can't forget Stomper, Gimlet, or Legolam.  This is a fun book that traces the adventure of \\"Lord of the Rings\\", from Frito's first acquiring the ring through the end of the quest in Fordor.  It is a short book, but fun, and as the authors write, it is primarily about making money.	2004-01-02

This is not just faint praise or exaggeration.  \\"Classy\\" Freddie Blassie is a true legend of the ring and his career spans a half century as a wrestler and a manager.  All I knew of Blassie was that he was a manager and that he was still used in some WWE promotional videos about the legacy of the WWE.  When I first started watching wrestling as a small child, Blassie was unfortunately ending his career as a manger, so I never had a chance to see the man work.<br />This book takes us over the span of Blassie's wrestling career, and also his life.  This is a look at a completely different era of wrestling, one where there were no high flyers and very few people outside of the business knew that wrestling was fixed.  We see Blassie's rise in the business as he wrestled in various territories (there was no single big Federation like the WWE, but rather the country was split into many wrestling territories) as well as in Japan.  We see Blassie's failings as a family man, a husband, and a father, and we see his partial redemption in his last wife.  All of this is told in Blassie's rather crass, vulgar, but fairly genial, personality.  A sense of Fred Blassie the man really comes out in this (auto)biography.<br />Even though this book is published by WWE, Blassie does not hold back his venom against those he has issues with, nor does he stint on praise for those who have behaved well towards him.  Woven in throughout this book are short segments written by people who knew Blassie and are commenting on particular things about Blassie's life and career that happen to be relevant to the chapter at hand.  These people include his son Ron (the only one of his children he still had contact with), his wife, George \\"The Animal\\" Steele, Vince McMahon, The Rock, and some other professional wrestlers from Blassie's day.<br />I was surprised by just how much I enjoyed this book.  I know very little about the older eras of professional wrestling and only the names of some of the stars of the time.  I found this to be a fascinating book as a fan of wrestling, but I think that this would also be interesting for anyone (even someone who has never watched a match and never will).  This is an interesting story and Blassie has led a very interesting life.  The only word of warning I will give is that Blassie is frequently profane in this book, but now you are warned.he older eras of professional wrestling and only the names of some of the stars of the time.

Like the first volume, this is a collection of a wide variety of writing, both fiction and nonfiction alike.  Also, like the first volume, there are a few excellent pieces in this collection with the rest being good, but not quite as good.  A couple of the standout pieces are Mark Bowden's \\"Tales of the Tyrant\\", Daniel Voll's \\"Riot Baby\\", and Ryan Boidinot's \\"The Littlest Hitler\\".  The Tyrant in question in Bowden's piece is Saddam Hussein, and this is a very interesting look at the dictator.  Daniel Voll's article is about a boy who was born during the L.A.

I finally got my change with \\"Alpha &amp; Omega: The Search for the Beginning and End of the Universe\\".  The title tells us exactly what the book is about: The Search for the Beginning and End of the Universe.  In this book Seife informs us about what scientists know about how the universe began, and what they think they know about how the universe will one day end.  Charles Seife has a rare talent for taking extremely complex and difficult scientific concepts and explaining them in a way that those concepts are understandable to a lay-reader.<br />Charles Seife examines what the accepted scientific view of the beginning of the universe was, and he shows how that view has evolved over time until scientists had more data to give a clearer picture of the origins of the universe.  Seife also tells us how scientists have figured out how the universe is likely to end.  He tells us what scientists know, and more importantly, how they know it.  This is very important because it shows the advances made in scientific knowledge as well as because of the fact that it explains the knowledge on a more basic level that makes sense.  The theories become more real and less of an alien concept to someone like me who does not have a depth of knowledge in science.<br />Even though Seife went to great lengths to explain the science in the simplest language possible without losing the depth of the information presented, some of it still went over my head a bit.  Seife's volume can be best used as a primer and as introduction to the topic.  He has a smooth writing style that makes the book very easy to read even with the difficult concepts presented.  This is another excellent book by Charles Seife and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the scientific explanations for the origins of the universe.	2003-12-18

There are rather significant differences, of course.  \\"Rediscovery\\" takes place a couple of thousand years after \\"Darkover Landfall\\" and the ship that colonized Darkover is known only as one of the \\"Lost Ships\\" that was unaccounted for.  The Terran spacecraft has been traveling for several years, looking for a habitable planet on which to land and conduct experiments to determine whether or not the planet is able to be colonized.  The novel's viewpoint switches back and forth between the ship and the telepath's who learn the ship is coming.<br />Part of the novel (that which is suggested by the title) is focused on the ship, its crew, and the discovery that the people of Darkover are comprised of the descendants of former Terran colonists.  The other viewpoint is that of the native Darkovans.  We see Leonie Hastur, a woman going to train her extremely powerful laran in one of the Towers.  Even though I know the novel's focus was truly on the rediscovery of Darkover, it was the Leonie chapters that interested me the most.<br />The events of this novel were a turning point in the history of Darkover as there will now be a Terran presence on Darkover and a greater technological impact on what was once a low-tech world.  This was not one of the best Darkover novels, but I enjoyed it and it was a story that needed to be told as it allows for all of the novels that are set after \\"Rediscovery\\".  I would not start the series with \\"Rediscovery\\", but if you like the series then there is no reason you shouldn't read this one, too.	2003-12-18

James Loewen examines 12 of the leading American History textbooks and looks at what they do and do not tell about American History.  Loewen looks at American history and some of the biggest myths that our textbooks present as fact.  When I first started reading this book I expected Loewen to examine some lies and debunk them.  He does do this, but the level of detail James Loewen provides is staggering.<br />Here's an example: There is a chapter in this book titled \\"The Truth About the First Thanksgiving\\".  Loewen discusses what American children are commonly taught, about how the Pilgrims were blown off course and landed on Plymouth Rock and how the Pilgrims became friends with the Indians and that the Thanksgiving Feast has been a yearly tradition ever since that time.  Loewen then reveals how much of that story is not true and backs up his case with documentation.  Even when I felt that Loewen had made his case, he kept on piling more and more evidence on top of the story.  It almost felt as if Loewen was going for an overkill of evidence against the textbook's version.  Loewen examines various textbooks to see which ones got something right, and how many of them completely miss the mark and just parrot back the common thanksgiving myth.  Loewen does the same thing on chapters on: The heroification of Woodrow Wilson and Hellen Keller, Christopher Columbus, Race History, Abraham Lincoln and John Brown, the American Indians.<br />This book is at its best when examining the mistruths that American History textbooks have taught us, and how they have taught us.  The last couple of chapters are different, the examine how the textbooks came to be like this, and what can be done about it.  This is where I began to lose interest, when Loewen began making conclusions on how textbooks should be written and how they can be fixed.<br />I loved this book and found it very insightful on just how much is omitted from text books and what is presented as fact that has no basis in reality.  I found it striking that half of the text books Loewen examined didn't even have a bibliography, thus making it impossible to check the sources the text books may have used.  I feel that everyone (Americans, at least) should read this book to see what has been misrepresented in history classes.ed this book and found it very insightful on just how much is omitted from text books and what is presented as fact that has no basis in reality.

If you didn't have any way of finding out the author of this book, but if you are familiar with the work of David Eddings, it is very easy to tell that this is a David Eddings novel.  Not only is the style of writing consistent with his previous books, but several characters are reminiscent of previous characters (Polgara, Flute, Talen/Silk, etc).  To be perfectly honest, this feels like a story that David Eddings has already told before, only this time he isn't telling it quite as well as before.<br />This is a story of the Land of Dhrall.  This world (which contains Dhrall) is a primitive place, even considering this is a fantasy setting.  Dhrall is ruled over by 4 gods, each taking a Domain to rule.  Each Domain is one of the 4 compass directions, and in the center is a wasteland ruled by That-Called-The Vlagh, a hideous godlike creature.  The four gods rule over Dhrall for 25 eons while 4 other gods sleep.  At the end of the cycle, the gods which have been awake rest for 25 eons and the sleeping gods awake to take their place.  When the book starts, it is nearing the end of one of these cycles and The Vlagh is plotting to take over the world.<br />The four gods hire out mercenary armies to defend their domains from The Vlagh.  The god of the North, Dahlaine, creates four young children called The Dreamers.  The Dreamers are actually the sleeping Elder Gods, but Dahlaine has figured out how to block their memories of being gods until they are older and it is time to change the cycles.  The Dreamers have the ability to see the future in their dreams and also to affect that future through their dreams.  With the Dreamers and the mercenary armies, the four gods hope to defend their Domains from the Vlagh and also to hopefully destroy the Vlagh.<br />The focus of this novel is in the Western Domain of Zelana.  Zelana has rather striking resemblances to Polgara (from the Belgariad) when she talks, and Zelana's Dreamer Eleria reminded me of Flute (from the Elenium).<br />As much as I was looking forward to this book, it was a bit of a let down.  It was too much like Edding's previous 16 books (Belgariad, Mallorean, Elenium, Tamuli), only it didn't have the depth of story and character that those books had.  The Elder Gods was not a terribly interesting book, but if you are a fan of David Eddings, it was a very familiar book.  Like all of Edding's work, it is a fast reading book (despite my disinterest), so I didn't spend a lot of time on it.  I can only hope that in the next three books of this series there will be more development of character and story.  I can't recommend this book.  Only read this is you are a completionist and want to read everything David Eddings has written.  Otherwise, skip this one.

Barry Farber is a well known radio host who has interviewed some of the most important people in America and this book is his \\"self-help\\" book on how to make people talk.  Like many other conversation books, this one is about (mostly) speaking to people you do not know very well.  Farber takes a different approach to this and also talks about why you want to cultivate both friendships as well as casual relationships with many people.  It is about what they can do for you.  Farber explains that this is not a cold, callous way to look at it, because if you cultivate a relationship by talking, people will want to help you out if they are able (they may be able to help you get a job, give you advise, help with a promotion, get choice basketball tickets, etc).  Farber also notes that some people who you initially are speaking with because of their potential value to you may become a better friend than those you have grown up with.  Farber also writes that it is everyone who you should improving your communications with and making them feel that what they have to say is important.<br />This book is written with many anecdotes from Barry Farber's life to illustrate the point he is making, and it was much more interesting than I expected.  This is not a dry explanation on how to better make people talk, but an engaging book.  Farber does not suggest that this will be easy, but only that it is worthwhile to be able to make people talk.	2003-12-16

Like the other Darkover novels, this book can stand on its own with no need of having read the preceding books in the series. At the time this book was published, it was the first Darkover novel to have been released in Hardcover and it was the first new Darkover novel in a five year period.  Unfortunately, this is not among the best of Marion Zimmer Bradley's work.<br />This novel is the story of the duchy of Hammerfell and the result of its ancient blood feud with neighboring Storn.  The novel opens with the aging (40 something) Duke of Hammerfell taking Ermine as a wife.  She gives birth to twin boys.  When they are perhaps a year old, there is an attack by Ardrin of Storn.  Their home is destroyed, and their father murdered.  Ermine escapes, but gets separated from the man carrying the younger son, Conn.  Each boy is raised believing that they are the only surviving heir to Hammerfell.  Alastair is raised by his mother in the Hastur capital city of Thendara.  Conn is raised by Markos, a family retainer, in the mountains of Hammerfell.<br />This is the story of twins, separated at a young age, and their attempt to regain the duchy of Hammerfell from their ancient enemy of Storn.  The two are reunited eighteen years later, and what could have/should have been a major conflict in the book is shuffled to the side with minimal contention between Conn and Alastair.  This book is as much of a romance as the adventure that it hinted at being.<br />I like the Darkover series, but this is perhaps the worst of the books that I have read so far.  There is very little actual conflict (even though it had such a great set-up), and what conflict there was got resolved with so little fuss that it hardly seemed worth it.  I would recommend this book only if you were looking to read all of the Darkover novels.  As each book stands on its own, there is no reason to read this to complete your understanding of the story, and this should certainly not be the first book you read if you are starting the series.  It's just not that good.r understanding of the story, and this should certainly not be the first book you read if you are starting the series.  It's just not that good.	2003-12-11

This is another book (the first in a series) that is based on biblical prophecy.  The Left Behind books were based on the prophecies of Revelation.  Babylon Rising is based on the prophecies found in the book of Daniel.  The other main difference is that Babylon Rising takes place before the Rapture (the starting even of Left Behind).  In the introduction to this book, Tim LaHaye writes that he is more excited about this book (and the coming series) than he has been about any other project that he has worked on.  He is teaming with Greg Dinallo to write a fast paced, biblical based, adventure/thriller.  LaHaye feels that the hero of this story, Michael Murphy is a fantastic protagonist, one who we should be excited to read about.<br />Michael Murphy is a biblical archaeologist.  That means that he finds ancient artifacts and uses them to authenticate the Bible.  For some time now, he has been given tips by a man who calls himself \\"Methuselah\\".  Methuselah gives Murphy a tip on how to find an artifact, but at the same time he sets traps around this artifact that could easily kill Murphy.  Michael accepts this and goes along with it because every biblical artifact has turned out to be genuine.  Michael Murphy seems to be cut out of the Indiana Jones mold, only with a strong Christian morality.<br />When Murphy finds the latest artifact that Methuselah lays before him, it sets him on a path to confront a great Evil (with a capital E).  We are also introduced to the other side, an organization known as the Seven, and their murderous henchman named Talon.  As Murphy searches for a biblical artifact known as the Brazen Serpent, an endtime prophecy of Daniel begins to unfold.<br />As LaHaye wrote in the introduction, this is a fast paced adventure book.  It is based on biblical prophecy, but unlike Left Behind, this one didn't hook me.  I was able to read the book quite quickly, but I wasn't too interested in what happened to any of the characters (except for one minor character).  Rather than be the great Christian hero that LaHaye had hoped for, Michael Murphy is a caricature.  He is so idealized that he isn't believable as a character or as a person.  That might be part of the problem with the entire book.  While it is written with the best of intentions, the dialogue is horrible, the writing a step below that of Left Behind, and riddled with clich&eacute;.  There is no sense that the dialogue between characters could possibly be a real conversation.  It felt phony and forced.<br />With all that said, if you loved the Left Behind books, you may enjoy Babylon Rising.  It is similar to that series, and has the same basis in Biblical Prophecy.  I didn't find Babylon Rising to be very engaging at all.  It is a fast reading book, so you won't waste too much time reading it, but I feel that your time would be better spent elsewhere.ested in what happened to any of the characters (except for one minor character).

Benson Bobrick takes a look at historical figures who have stuttered, a list which includes Charles Darwin, Winston Churchill, Marilyn Monroe, Moses, and the Greek speaker Demosthenes.  Knotted Tongues is a look at how stuttering was perceived throughout history and how stuttering has been treated.<br />The part of this book that I found the most fascinating was the time it spent examining how stuttering was treated over time.  What I didn't expect was how cringe-inducing this would be.  There were some methods that involved the chewing of various substances, as well as other that involved speaking with a mouth full of pebbles.  The cringe-worthy methods involved scalding the tongue, and burning around the throat and head (the reasons had to do with what these doctors thought about the causes of stuttering).  As painful as these sound, the most brutal method of treatment was a surgery that cuts part of the tongue away.  Mind you, this was done before anesthetics.  There is a fairly graphic description of this surgery in the book.<br />Knotted Tongues is not a book about how to best treat stuttering, nor does it go into detail about the variety of modern (and much more humane) treatments available today.  This is a history of stuttering.  It is easily readable, and does not go into the level of technical detail that you would find in Starkweather's \\"Stuttering\\".  While someone who stutters may have more interest in this book, I think that anyone would find this interesting, if only to see the various methods of treatment and how stutterers have been viewed throughout history.  Good book.	2003-12-10

He is a liberal, believes his way is right, and that George W Bush and the Bush Administration are bad for America in nearly every possible way.  Know this, and accept it going into this book.  If a book from a man who has this viewpoint interests you, then you should read the book.  If you are already offended, then you can stop reading the review and you should avoid Moore's book at all costs because it isn't for you because that is exactly what this book is about.<br />It is a good thing that Michael Moore cites where he got his sources from, because he makes some pretty outrageous claims about the Bush White House.  In Stupid White Men, Moore wrote about how Bush stole the election.  In Dude, Where's My Country, Michael Moore is taking on the lies that George Bush has told about why we went to war, and what the aims of the war truly are.  Moore writes about the evils of conservatism (which I don't entirely agree with) and that one of the most important things that can be done in the next presidential election is to vote George Bush out of office.  Moore gives a list of possible candidates (with Oprah being the most interesting, but Moore actually gives good reasons why Oprah should run and beat Bush), and his pick of the possible candidates (besides Oprah) is General Clark.  Considering this book was written before Clark had ever announced his candidacy, that is a very interesting and well thought out choice.<br />Moore is not all anti-conservative in this book.  He presents some things that he believes the Right has done well, and offers criticism of the left.  He believes in his viewpoint very strongly, but it seems that he has also thought about it for some time.  One flaw in the book, however, is that while at the beginning Moore offers questions and accusations towards the Bush Administration that are well documented, it feels like he is just trying to shout Bush out of office by the end.  At times Moore goes for humor, and it mostly works.  Reading this book a chapter at a time, I enjoyed reading it, and it helps present a healthy skepticism of our government (which also must be tempered by checking Moore's sources and to try to find cogent counter-arguments).  Now you know what this book is about, so there should be no surprises if you decide to read it.  I liked the book, and would recommend it to people who would be interested in reading it.  Obviously, this would not be a book for a big supporter of Ann Coulter or Bill O'Reilly.and it mostly works.

This book follows the development of the intellectual thinkers: Oliver Wendell Holmes, William James, Charles Peirce, and John Dewey.  According to Menand, these men were at the forefront of the intellectual movement in America following the Civil War right up to the Cold War era.  Menand writes \\"they were more responsible than any other group for moving American thought into the modern world.\\"  The movement of intellectual thought these four men developed is called \\"pragmatism\\".<br />The Metaphysical Club itself was an informal gathering of some of the leading intellectuals, but it was a fairly short lived club.  It serves, rather, as an identification for these shapers of Intellectual thought.  Holmes, James, and Peirce were contemporaries who knew each other and at times worked together.  Dewey was much younger and seems to be the heir to the Club that helped move their ideas forward into the 20th Century.  As such, it felt as if Dewey had the greatest importance, at least as it was presented in the book.  Holmes may have been the most prominent member, being a Supreme Court Justice.  Even though this book purports to be an examination of these four men, it also weaves in the stories of other leading intellectual figures of the age, including Emerson and Darwin.  This is a much bigger book than being just about four men.  It is about an era of American Thought.<br />This was an excellent book, very well written.  It was also challenging.  While I understood the concepts presented as I was reading them, I found it difficult to retain my grasp of the information when I had moved on to the next section and the next chapter.  This is a different sort of American history, being an intellectual history, but I'm sure that anyone who has any interest in that sort of thing will find this book fascinating.  It isn't a dry academic tome, by any means.	2003-12-09

This book is a collection of three short stories set in the universe of Ender's Game.  Ender's Game is one of my favorite books in any genre and the Ender series is one of the few actual science fiction that I read (I tend toward fantasy).  I wondered how short fiction set in this universe would fare.  I was pleasantly surprised.  This was a very enjoyable volume to read.<br />The first story was \\"The Polish Boy\\".  This is a story of Ender's father, Jean Paul.  Jean Paul was not even six years old, but was incredibly intelligent and gifted.  He was living in Poland, with his family in defiance of population control laws.  Families were only permitted two children, but Jean Paul's family is Catholic and they obey God not man.  This is the story of the interest that Battle School took in Jean Paul and hints at the future of Ender and how he to go be who he is.  This felt like the weakest of the three stories and I liked it the least.  It was little more than a prologue to Ender's Game and an unnecessary one at that.<br />The next story is my favorite of the bunch, \\"Investment Counselor\\" is the story of how Ender met Jane (Jane is the computer program that appears in Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, and Children of the Mind).  I liked seeing Ender not having yet become a Speaker, yet having written both Hive Queen, and the Hegemon.  Ender and his sister Valentine have arrived on a new planet.  Ender has just turned 20 (due to the slow aging in interspace travel) and now has to pay taxes on his revenue from his service in the Formic Wars (from Ender's Game) and also from his books.  As 400 years have passed (again, because of interspace travel, Ender and Valentine age very slowly while traveling), Ender has quite a bit more money that he would have imagined.  Enter Jane.  Some people may not find this story as interesting, but I always found Jane to be one of the most fascinating characters in the entire Enderverse.<br />The third and final story is the original \\"Ender's Game\\".  This was the story that Card wrote first and later expanded to the award winning novel Ender's game.  This story is quite a bit rougher and not nearly as polished as the novel.  It is still a good story (it was nominated for a Hugo), and it is interesting to see the evolution from this story to the novel.  Because this is the same story as the novel, only rougher, I didn't enjoy it quite as much as \\"Investment Counselor\\".  On the other hand, this could be a very good introduction to the Enderverse if someone has not read Ender's Game (the novel).<br />I am aware that this book has been republished with a fourth story \\"Teacher's Pet\\", dealing with Ender's mother.  This particular collection did not include that story, so I can't comment on it.  I finished this book a couple of hours after starting it, and I really enjoyed reading it.  It is a nice little collection, and I'm glad that I got the chance to read it and see how Ender met Jane (for me, this was the story that meant the most).er's Game\\".

Book 1 of the Farseer Trilogy<br />Assassin's Apprentice is the story of Fitz, the illegitimate son of Prince Chivalry.  At age six, he is put into the care of the Prince's man, Burrich.  Fitz does not speak much and he has no memory of his mother or father.  It is because Fitz was born that Chivalry left court and abdicated all of his rights to the throne.  This has caused some resentment (and potential problems) towards Fitz, but he doesn't know anything about that.  As Fitz grows older, he is noticed by King Shrewd.  Shrewd decides that Fitz should be educated, and he is put under the tutelage of various teachers in the castle.  He is also put in the care of Chade, a man who is to teach Fitz how to be an assassin for King Shrewd.<br />This is really just the beginning for Fitz.  We see as he grows and learns more about himself and about what his role may be for King Shrewd.  Unlike many other fantasy novels, it is a little difficult to tell exactly where Robin Hobb is going with this story.  For one thing, there isn't really a quest that Fitz must go on and perhaps save the world.  Fitz is training to be an assassin, a rather different skill for the hero of a fantasy novel.  Another thing that is different about this book is that it is told in the first person.  We know only what Fitz knows and we do not get to see action that Fitz does not have first hand knowledge of.  I was a little skeptical of this at first, but it works exceptionally well in this book.  The book is told as a kind of journal that Fitz is writing years later, telling the story of his youth.<br />This is a dark novel, and with the exception of perhaps a scene or two, it stays that way.  There are no rousing heroic victories and there is little fast-paced, light-hearted witty banter.  What we have is a very well told story, one that took perhaps a chapter or two for me to get into, but one that ultimately hooked me and has me looking for more.  This is a fantastic beginning to the Farseer Trilogy, and should be a must-read for fans of fantasy.rilogy, and should be a must-read for fans of fantasy.	2003-12-03

I was excited to find out that Pullman was publishing a little story featuring Lyra.  The book weighed in at about 60 pages, so I knew it wasn't going to be epic, but the expectations were there.<br />I was disappointed.  The story is that Lyra is back at Oxford several years after the events of His Dark Materials.  She, and her daemon, see a daemon bird flying in being chased by a huge flock of birds.  She rescues the daemon who tells Lyra that she needs to help the daemon find a professor, one who can help the daemon's witch.  It is a very short story, and while there is a wee sense of adventure, this slim volume has none of the charm and wonder of His Dark Materials.  Other than our familiarity with Lyra, we are given no reason to care about anything that happens.<br />This book feels like a teaser.  In the introduction, Pullman writes that the extras (there is a map, a post card and sundry extra information besides the story) may be from a different world, may be from stories already told, and may even be for a story yet to be told.  He is teasing us with a larger story, a grander tale than Lyra's Oxford.  It raises my expectations that Pullman will deliver a story large in scope, reminiscent of His Dark Materials.  But, even that hint of something to come only deepens my disappointment with this book.  Simply put, there is nothing there.  As a story, it is weak.  As an continuation of His Dark Materials, it does not live up to the past greatness.  All this book does is serve to remind me how good the main series is, and how much I would love to see a new series.  Skip this book.	2003-12-03

Chronologically, this is one of the early novels in Darkover's history.  There is less civilization and the Hundred Kingdoms are in a near perpetual state of war (someone is always fighting).  Despite the back of the book suggesting that Varzil the Good is a major player in this book, the real story here is that of Bard Di Asturian and Paul Harrell.<br />The book opens with a fascinating scene.  A criminal named Paul Harrell wakes up.  The last thing he knew was that he was convicted for rape and because Terra (Earth) no longer has the death penalty, he was locked in a stasis box.  He wakes up in a room and as he looks around he realizes that there is no way that he can possibly be on Terra anymore.  A man enters the room and he appears to be the identical twin to Paul, so much a twin that \\"twin\\" is the wrong word.  The man seems to be the same person as Paul.  The prologue ends and the novel truly begins.  We now start the main story seven years before Paul is somehow freed from the stasis box.<br />The protagonist of the story is Bard Di Asturian.  Bard is the illegitimate nephew of King Ardrin of the Asturias.  Rather than being raised in obscurity like most illegitimate children, Bard was raised as part of the family (the wife of Bard's father King Rafael never cared for Bard and forced him to live elsewhere).  We learn early on that Bard is to be handfasted (betrothed, more than an engagement less than a marriage) to the King's daughter, Carlina.  Carlina does not want to be married to anyone, and convinces her father to put off the actual marriage for a year until she turns 15.  This angers Bard, because he feels that he should be able to bed his wife any time he wants and that this is all just a trick to string him along until Carlina is taken away from him.  Bard has a misogynist view of women.  He feels that he should be able to have his way with any woman because they truly want it and that they are always asking for \\"it\\" and that women are only pretending that they didn't want it and lie, claiming that they were forced.  This is the same warped view that Paul has of women.<br />Time passes, and the year until the marriage is half over when Bard finally tries to force Carlina (this is after we have already seen him force another woman).  He is caught by Carlina's brother Beltran and their friend Geremy Hastur.  The King exiles Bard for seven years, in which he may not return to the realm on pain of death.  During this time Bard becomes a leader in several different armies and grows up a bit.  He still carries his hatred of women, but also an obsession for Carlina, whom he continues to view as his legal wife.  When Bard's time of exile ends, he is called back by his father to help lead an army against the Asturias.  Bard's father uses the laran (a magical/esp type power) to summon Bard's double (everyone has a true double somewhere).  Bard's double is a man from another world named Paul Harrell.<br />The main thrust of the story (no pun intended) is Bard's desire to finally bed Carlina and to have his revenge on the Asturias.  Paul can help with this, and we see them sort of circling each other, wondering how much they can trust each other.  This is a very interesting sub-plot (and it feels more like sub-plot than main story).<br />It is a different kind of novel that has two such unsympathetic characters as the protagonists.  We see the contrast of Paul/Bard in Varzil, a man who will later be known as \\"The Good\\".  Varzil is trying to institute The Compact, an agreement where those who join will ban all long distance weapons and all laran weapons.  Bard can't even comprehend this as he fights to win, not to be encumbered by rules.  Then there are the female characters.  As viewed by Bard, they are only there to be bedded (because they all want it anyway), and while they show Bard a better, more pure way, it takes a longtime (and a powerful event) for the lesson to sink in.<br />While the novel started out slowly, I became very interested in what was going on.  It was hard to actually have sympathy for Bard (he truly cared for his family and fought his best for what he felt was right....but he was still a rapist who didn't believe he was raping), but I wanted to read on to find out what happened next.  Marion Zimmer Bradley has a lot of interesting things going on in this book if you can get past how horrible of a person Bard is.es a long time (and a powerful event) for the lesson to sink in.  <br />While the novel started out slowly, I became very interested in what was going on.

It was written primarily for physicians, though people who stutter (and their friends/family) may find some value in the book.  It describes (in technical detail) and defines stuttering and talks about how stuttering happens.  It does not answer the question of why, which is a question that nobody has an answer for, but it does reveal the mechanics of how stuttering occurs.  The authors reveal that stuttering is partially genetic, but not always.  The book shows how complex a behavior stuttering is.<br />The book does get into the treatment of stuttering, both for children and adults.  The one thing I would like to note about this is that it seems like the sections on treatment is geared more to speech therapists rather than a patient.  It gives an idea of how a physician should treat stuttering, but not the actual techniques used.  This book is more of a reference than a \\"self-therapy\\" book, so if you are thinking about getting this book, please understand what kind of book it is.  It is highly technical and detailed for the physician, and only in short sections did I find value in it as a stutterer.	2003-11-25

It is a children's novel, but it is just as enjoyable for an adult to read (much like Harry Potter).  Rather than being the typical sort of fairy tale, this one twists the whole convention.  There are fairies, sprites, dwarves, and goblins, but not quite as we know them.  The time period is the present day and we see the interaction between the species of fairy and human.  There are guns, magic, and a whole lot of adventure in this book.<br />What sets Artemis Fowl is the title character.  He is the protagonist (mostly), but he is also the villain.  Artemis is a 12 year old master criminal trying to rob the fairies of their gold.  How this all comes about is a joy to read, and is highly creative.

The Deryni novels have long been one of my favorite series, and I'm always eagerly awaiting a new Deryni novel.  Despite what the book jacket suggests, this novel takes place during the era of King Kelson's grandfather King Donal.  Kelson's father Brion is only a young child during this novel, and this is more than a hundred years after the Haldane Restoration of 917.  This is one of the time periods that when I looked at the genealogy of the Haldanes, I wondered \\"what was happening then?  Who is Donal?\\"  We get an answer in this book.<br />There is a story here, but there is no true plot, if that makes any sense.  We are given a fantastic look at Donal's court and we spend some time with the Camberian Council.  Characters mention the Airsid, Orin, and Jodotha (three things I would love to have explored in detail), and there is even a brief mention of my favorite Haldane: Javan (from King Javan's Year).  The main story of this novel, spanning several years, however, is that of Alyce de Corwyn and who will be the heir to the duchy of Corwyn.  All the while, King Donal needs to have a magical protector for his son, Brion, and he will do anything to get one.  To be honest, that's about it.  There is plenty of action, several characters are killed off, and I did not want to put the book down, but there is still not a whole lot of plot in this novel.  It is more like a series of scenes rather than a story that is truly leading somewhere.<br />Even so, I began to care for some of the characters.  Alyce is a very sympathetic character and looks like she might be one of the stronger female characters since Evaine.  There are several interesting supporting characters, but one of the most interesting characters in the novel is Donal himself.  He is a conflicted character.  On one hand he wants to do what is right for Gwynedd, his subjects, and his family.  On the other hand, he is absolutely ruthless and is willing to do anything and everything to get his way (which he thinks is right and proper as King and that it is for the good of the realm).  I wish that more time would have been spent dealing with the Camberian Council and I only hope that the next two novels will focus more on the Council.  There are a lot of ways for this series to go and despite the lack of plot, I loved every minute of this book and I can't wait for the next one.r hand, he is absolutely ruthless and is willing to do anything and everything to get his way (which he thinks is right and proper as King and that it is for the good of the realm).

Book 1 of A Song of Ice and Fire<br />With all the heaps of praise already lavished on this book and the series as a whole, it seems almost silly for me to add my voice to everyone else's.  The reason I am doing so is simply that the book is just that good.  This is the first book of a proposed 6 book series (three have been published, book four is eventually on its way) and is a spectacular start to the series.  George Martin is weaving several different stories to create a larger tapestry and only at the end will we see quite how everything pulls together.<br />The largest story arc in this novel is that of the Starks.  Lord Eddard Stark is Lord of Winterfell in the North.  He is a personal friend of the King and he is an upright and moral man.  He is called down to King's Landing (the capital city) to assist Robert Baratheon as the Hand of the King.  We are introduced the Starks: Lady Catelyn (his wife), Robb (heir), Bran (son), Rickon (youngest son), Sansa (eldest daughter), Arya (daughter), and Jon Snow (illegitimate son).  Even though this is already a large number of characters, each character is important and most of them get chapters from their own viewpoint.  George Martin uses multiple narrators to tell the story.  In Eddard's appointment as Hand, there is a lot of intrigue, some attempted murder, and action.<br />The enemies of the Stark family are the Lannisters.  While the Starks are presented as the protagonists and the heroes, the Lannisters are the villains, but as the novel goes by this is not quite as black and white as it first appears (and becomes less clear still as the series progresses).  The wife of the King is a Lannister, and they seem to be behind a lot of the political intrigue surrounding the King.  Tyrion Lannister, the deformed son, is perhaps the most interesting character of the series and I believe the most well-developed.  He is easily my favorite character out of the many that are presented.<br />If there is not enough ground to cover with the Starks and the Lannisters, we are also introduced to Daenerys, a scion of the former ruling family of the Seven Kingdoms (15 years before, Robert Baratheon led a coup to remove the previous King).  She is in a land far to the East and along with her brother they are trying to find away to go back home and to take back their father's throne from the usurper.  Eventually this will tie into the main conflict between the Starks and the Lannisters.<br />This series (and even this book) is absolutely stunning in scope.  It is a huge story and in this first book we are only feeling out the edges of what the true story is.  There is incredible depth and the story is revealed from the viewpoints of many characters, some of them would not normally be considered a \\"good guy\\", and this only adds to the richness of Westeros.  Simply put, this is one of the best fantasy series that I have read, and this is just the beginning of this deep, deep saga.  Coming in at nearly 800 pages, I didn't want this book to end.  To any fan of fantasy: I cannot recommend this book highly enough.nd to cover with the Starks and the Lannisters, we are also introduced to Daenerys, a scion of the former ruling family of the Seven Kingdoms (15 years before, Robert Baratheon led a coup to remove the previous King).

Eliot initially wrote the poems for his god-children, but this is no simplistic children's literature.  T.S. Eliot was a master of his craft.  The poems are simple stories about a variety of cats, each with a distinct personality and behaviors.  The poems have a rhythm all their own and it matches the personality of the cat being described.  While a poem about Bustopher Jones has an arch, airy tone, the poem about Skimbleshanks speeds along like the train he is on.  This is an absolutely delightful collection.<br />It wasn't until recently, when I saw the musical for the first time, that I learned that this collection was the basis for the musical: Cats.  Not only did the musical bring to life the cats described by Mr. Eliot, but I was surprised by just how many songs in the show took the lyrics directly from Eliot's poems.  That is a mark of a great collection of poems: that when they are lifted into song, those poems can make a great musical with few changes.  Whether you like poetry, or not, I would recommend this collection.  I do not read a lot of poetry, but I loved this collection.  Whether you like cats, or not, I would still recommend this book.  The way Eliot tells about the cats, you would almost swear they were real people and not just an animal.	2003-11-12

I had trouble thinking of even the little things that should be oh so obvious.  For me, nothing was obvious.  I just needed help remembering to show the most basic gestures of love.  I love my girlfriend, I just didn't show her nearly as often as I should.  That's where this book comes in.<br />The book is exactly what the title suggests: 1001 ways to be romantic.  Each suggestion is numbered, and there are really more than 1001 suggestions (some are numbered 532a, 532b, etc).  As I was reading the book, I had a pen and a notepad next to me and I wrote down the ones that I thought I would be able to do and that would be possible to do in my relationship.  I wrote down quite a few.<br />This book is just a list (in larger font and with explanations) of various ways of how to be romantic.  As reading material, I would recommend reading a little bit at a time and finding tips that you find useful.  This is not a book to read through in a single sitting.  You can read through the book, taking notes as I did, or you can just flip to a page and take a suggestion to try.  Either way, I think that everyone (specifically males) will find this a useful book.  Highly recommended.	2003-11-11

I found it in a library using a search for books on conversation and how to have better conversations.  The book is nothing more than a list of questions that can be asked in conversation.  That's it.  There are about 300 questions, and the book is broken up into sections where questions about related topics will all be grouped together.  The problem was that many of the questions were not very interesting and I can hardly imagine asking them.  There were a few questions that I felt I might want to ask, and I wrote those down, but as a whole the book was a waste of my time.  It seemed like the questions were for if you were at a dinner party with a group of people you don't know and needed a random question to move the conversation.  If you want a book that is a list of questions, this one may be for you, but I fear that I can't recommend this book.	2003-11-11

This was a fascinating collection.  Most of the \\"Best American\\" collections are straight forward.  You have a good idea of what you're going to get, and if you are widely read in those subjects (sports writing, science writing, short stories, etc), you may have come across most of those essays/stories.  In this first collection of Non-required reading, you get the best stories and essays that would never be assigned in school and are from alternative magazines (rather than the large respected newspapers like the New York Times).  The pieces collected very from short fiction, to political essays, to a graphic story (as in a story told in comic panels), to humor.  It is a varied collection and most of the work is top-notch (I was less impressed with \\"Hubcap Diamondstar Halo\\").<br />Some highlights are \\"Speed Demons\\", \\"Journal of a new COBRA recruit\\" (yes, COBRA as in from G.I. Joe....this may be my favorite of the collection), \\"My Fake Job\\", \\"Fourth Angry Mouse\\", \\"Why McDonald's Fries Taste So Good\\", the two short pieces from the Onion, \\"Higher Education\\", and \\"Bomb Scare\\" (Bomb Scare is the graphic story).  Just browsing through the table of contents, I was able to list 9 pieces that I would highlight and recommend.  If there was nothing else in the collection, that would be enough to recommend it.  But, there are other quality pieces in this collection.  If you want to read short pieces (both fiction and nonfiction) that you might not ordinarily run across every day, this is the collection for you.	2003-11-06

I was skeptical about this book, mostly because the flaws of Left Behind are in that it isn't extremely well written (powerful and compelling, but not exceptionally well written).  I wasn't sure I wanted to read another religious End Times type story, especially from the same guy.  Parts of the premise started sounding more interesting, and I finally decided to give it a shot.  The style is very similar, it is a fast paced novel and rather simplistic at times, but a lot of fun to read.<br />It is 36 years after World War III (which happened in 2009).  The war was a religious war and the end result was that there is a worldwide ban on religion.  This would ensure that there would be no more conflict as most of the world's conflicts had to do with religion.  Now, 36 years later, whatever religion that exists has gone underground.  Religion and all aspects of it are illegal, and it is hated, feared and denounced by most of the world's population (think a Big Brother sort of indoctrination against religion).<br />Paul Stepola is an agent for the National Peacekeeping Organization. He is rabidly anti-religious, though he is a religion scholar (know thy enemy).  His role is to kill (persecute) believers.  There are reports of Christian groups popping up all over the country and it is his job to track them down and shut them down, with force.  Paul begins the novel as rabidly anti-religious as you can be, but over the course of the book he softens and his journey mirrors that of Paul the Apostle (in the Bible, see the book Acts of the Apostles).<br />There are some very interesting concepts in this book, specifically the vision of the future where religion is outlawed.  We know from the beginning that this book will have a Christian tint to it and will naturally support a Christian worldview, but this is also just an interesting book to read.  I mentioned earlier that it was a fast moving book, and it is.  This is the kind of book that I just fly through.  Like the Left Behind novels, the writing is simplistic (not necessarily a bad thing) and this time there weren't any names that felt amateurish and grating like Buck Williams did.  I didn't expect to enjoy this novel, but I did.  It is the first book of a proposed trilogy, and considering how fast Jerry Jenkins writes, you won't have to wait long for book 2 to come out.

It is set a number of years before Frank Herbert's classic: Dune.  The novel spans several years and traces several characters, most specifically Leto Atredies, Vladimir Harkonnen, Gurney Halleck, Lady Jessica, and Duncan Idaho.  Leto is trying to grow into both the man as well as the Duke that his father would have wanted him to be.  Vladimir Harkonnen is suffering from the effects of the disease given to him by the Bene Gesserit and is plotting against the Bene Gesseritt, the Emporer, as well as House Atreides.  Duncan Idaho is training to be the deadly swordsmaster that we came to know in Dune (this is actually more interesting than you might expect).  Jessica is in training with the Bene Gesserit, and it is in this novel that she finally meets Leto for the first time.  We see Gurney growing up under the thumb of the Harkonnen's and how he will come to be in the service of the Atreides.  That's a lot of plot to cover, but that is only a portion of all that is in this rather large and detailed novel.  We also have rebellions on Ix, the Bene Tleilax, the Fremen, hints of the Muad'ib, use of the forbidden atomics, and a whole lot of story.<br />Since the Dune prequels are written by Frank Herbert's son, Brian, as well as Kevin Anderson, the style of writing is much different than Frank's original Dune.  Despite the novel's heft, it is a fast moving story with fairly short chapters bouncing from character viewpoint to character viewpoint.  I would not recommend reading House Harkonnen without first having read House Atreides.  There is too much detail that would be missed.  Brian and Kevin are working from Frank's notes and are filling in the backstory that Frank only hinted at.  This (and the rest of the House trilogy) is a worthy addition to the Dune universe.  It's not the same novel that Frank might have written, but it should be an interesting one for fans of Dune	2003-11-04

There are numerous stories of men and women who have lived their lives to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  Jesus Freaks is a collection of these stories, each of them fairly short (ranging from just a page up to at most 10 pages).  While the first volume was a collection of stories of those who were martyred because of their faith, this second volume is subtitled \\"Stories of Revolutionaries Who Changed Their World - Fearing God, Not Man\\".  It is a collection of stories about how the Christian witness of these men and women was an impetuous for change in their communities and even in their countries.  Interspersed with these stories are Bible verses relating to these stories of faith as well as messages asking the reader to pray for the persecuted church as well as to live their lives as a strong witness on fire for God.<br />I enjoyed reading this volume, and it was inspiring to read some of the stories of these men and women living for God, but for whatever reason, I wasn't as blown away as I was for the first volume (the one dealing with people who were martyred for their faith in Christ).  That was an absolutely stunning collection and I suppose any further volume would be, comparatively, a let down.  Make no mistake, though, this is a very interesting volume, with good stories.<br />The one problem that I have is the lack of documentation for each of the stories.  We do not know the sources for the stories, especially those labeled with something like \\"a pastor\\" or something similar.  We have no idea if these are stories that are easy to document or if some of them are based as much on Christian legend as on fact.  While I do believe these are all true stories, and I trust the integrity of the members of D.C. Talk as well as the Voice of the Martyrs organization, a little documentation would have gone a long way to answer the skeptics who will ask where that story came from.from.	2003-11-04

I was interested to see what kind of road a woman takes to get to the WWE and how she became interested in wrestling.  Lita is one of the more popular woman wrestlers today (second to Trish Stratus) and for some time she was teamed up with the Hardy Boyz (and real life boyfriend Matt Hardy).  This book is co-authored by Michael Krugman.  Krugman was the co-author of the Hardy Boyz biography.<br />Amy Dumas was always a free spirit, and as a kid she found her identity in the punk-rock music scene.  This has formed her attitudes (in a positive way, she discovered some positive punk music) and later this has formed her wrestling character.  One day she was watching WCW with a boyfriend and was blown away by the cruiserweight division, specifically Rey Mysterio.  She decided that was something she would like to do (wrestle, not be a female valet) and went down to Mexico and get some training.  From the point that Amy decides that she wants to wrestle, you can guess how much of the book is going to go.  Amy is a little full of herself as a wrestler (as well as a high view of some of her ideas for wrestling), but what makes this book different from many other wrestling biographies is Amy's positive attitude.  She is very positive about her role in the WWE, what she wants to do in life, and this attitude comes through in the book.  The biography is written in a highly readable style and it flows smoothly.  Some highlights were reading about Amy's experience on Fear Factor and The Weakest Link.  She had an interesting perspective on the shows.  Actually, she has an interesting perspective on the entire wrestling business.<br />This was a surprisingly interesting book that may appeal to people who are not wrestling fans.  I'm not sure if I would put this at the top echelon of the wrestling biography (Mick Foley, Jerry Lawler), but I would certainly place this above Roddy Piper's book and far above Hulk Hogan's.  It is a simple read, but interesting all the same.), but I would certainly place this above Roddy Piper's book and far above Hulk Hogan's.  It is a simple read, but interesting all the same.	2003-10-29

She is best known as an award winning novelist (Love Medicine, The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse), but is also an accomplished poet.  This collection is not a completely original volume, however.  It takes quite a few poems from her previous two volumes (Jacklight, Baptism of Desire) as well as some poems that have never before been published.<br />I'm not a huge fan of poetry, but since Louise Erdrich is my favorite author I'm willing to read the book.  I enjoyed the poetry, but it didn't inspire me or speak to me or any of the other things that poetry is supposed to do.  The best section of the book was the prose poems from Jacklight (I believe).  The stories were interesting, funny, and made me want to keep reading.  I'm not as knowledgeable about poetry as I am about other forms of literature, so I find it difficult to say it is good or bad poetry,  but I would suggest that it is good.  I enjoyed reading this collection, but I do feel that it is a less work compared to her novels.	2003-10-27

After all, The Human Stain did not win the Pulitzer Prize, but American Pastoral did.  Could this book really be so much better that it would win the highest literary prize in America.  The short, uncomplicated answer is no.  I dont think that American Pastoral is the better novel out of the two.  The longer, more complicated answer has the ultimate conclusion of: While I feel that The Human Stain is the better of the two novels, American Pastoral is an excellent novel and extremely well written.  With these two novels, Philip Roth has earned his spot on my list of the great American novelists.<br />American Pastoral is another novel narrated by the novelist Nathan Zuckerman.  Zuckerman was a couple of years behind Swede Levov in high school, and decades later Levov contacts Zuckerman.  Zuckerman tells Levovs story.  Unlike The Human Stain, Zuckerman is not a major player in the novel but rather sets up the context for telling the story and then steps out and just writes about the Swede.  The Swede was the Golden Boy in his high school.  Everything he did turned out perfect.  He was the star athlete and everyone wanted to emulate him, even Zuckerman.  The Swede ended up marrying Miss New Jersey and seemed to live a charmed life.  He did not go into professional sports as expected, but rather followed in his fathers footsteps by working in, and later taking over, his fathers glove factory.<br />In talking to Zuckerman, Swede lets it drop that there was a major tragedy in the family but doesnt ever say what it was.  Zuckerman assumes that Swedes younger brother, Jerry, is gay and that it tore Mr Levov apart.  But thats not it.  Instead it has to do with Swedes daughter, Merry, and how her actions in her teenage years just broke the family apart.  Swede had the perfect life, the American Dream, and that dream was shattered.  American Pastoral is the story of that dream, and it is also the story of the harsh shadow that the American Dream can cast.  We see the idealized American Dream of the 1940s and 1950s, and we see what happens to those who live the dream when it stretches into the 1960s and 1970s.  American Pastoral is a powerful novel spanning a generation and has to be considered one of Roths greatest novels (despite what I said about The Human Stain).  Im usually disappointed by Pulitzer Prize Winning Novels, but not this one.  It is slow moving and methodical, but always interesting..

Sparrowhawk begins as a young goat herder on the island of Gont.  He is being trained by a witch there, but when he uses his powers to defend his island from attack, he attracts the notice of a powerful wizard named Ogion.  Ogion tells Sparrowhawk that his true name is Ged.  (a true name holds great power in Earthsea for it permits the speaker power over the named) and takes him on as an apprentice.  Ged learns quickly and is reckless in both his learning of magic as well as his application of magic, and this eventually gets him in trouble.  Ged desires more knowledge and goes to the school at Roke.  It is here that Ged truly excels, but it is also at Roke that he casts a spell that calls a shade (best description of it without spoiling it) that is much stronger than Ged.<br />This begins the quest portion of the book as Ged both flees from the shade and later confronts it (that's not a spoiler, you had to know it's coming).  There is magic use, a really nice fight against dragons, and some adventure.  Overall, I wasn't too excited about this book.  I know it is a classic in the fantasy field, but it was a little slower and less interesting than I had hoped.  It was well written, certainly, but it also lacked a little something to make me want to keep turning the pages.  Honestly, I didn't care what happened to Sparrowhawk.  And so, I can't really recommend this book.	2003-10-22

He gives a pronunciation/terms list so that visitors won't sound so much like outsiders when talking to local residents.  Knowing the other work of Palahniuk, you can go into this book expecting this to be an unconventional travel guide.  Palahniuk has a unique outlook on life and what is worth seeing and he presents that in this book.<br />There is no narrative in this travel book, but it is broken up into sections.  In each section, Palahniuk lists (and describes) various things to see and do in Portland.  One section may be on eateries, another on haunted locations, yet another on gardens.  In each section, we are given off-the-beaten-path ideas of what to do and where to go in Portland.  Even if you have no interest in traveling to Portland, this makes for an interesting book to read.  You get a sense of the city and the city's fringe elements.  It gives a different flavor than what you might expect from a Fodor's travel guide.  I would recommend this book to fans of Palahniuk or anyone looking to read an interesting and different travel guide.	2003-10-14

I have difficulty talking to people if I don't know them very well.  That's one problem, but the real reason I read this book was my other problem: thinking of things to say with people I do know.  Larry King (the king of talking) addresses the first problem, but not the second.  He gives tips and techniques about how to talk to strangers and how to speak in a business setting.  This advice is valuable.  There were tips that I found useful, but as a whole, this book did not address what I needed.<br />Fortunately, this was an interesting book to read as King gives examples and illustrations from his own life and career.  He explains things clearly and if I would have been reading this to help me converse with strangers, there would have been more value in reading this book.  If you are thinking about reading this book for being able to converse with strangers, I would give this book a try.  If you are looking at it for my reason, skip it and try something else.	2003-10-14
US	52402330	R3S5AZF4APKNOZ	0060509058	486440079	Travels	Books	4	5	8	N	N	a fascinating book on Crichton's time travelling the world	I've been a fan of Crichton's fiction since I first read Jurassic Park years ago.  I love how he mixes reality with the potential science of the future.  The events in his novels may not be possible, but when Crichton tells the story you believe that they are plausible.  Perhaps it is Crichton's attention to detail that makes the stories both so interesting as well as believable.  It is this same attention to detail that makes Travels such an interesting book.<br />Travels is a series of essays broken up into two sections.  The first section deals with Crichton's time in medical school.  These stories are very interesting as we get to see some of the inner working of hospitals, and some of the stuff that we wouldn't see on TV (and might not believe if we did).  This was a fascinating section.  The second section of the book was most of the book and it dealt with Crichton's travels.  I'm not a huge fan of travel writing (normally), but I was blown away by the depth (or length) of Crichton's travels.  He truly is a world traveler and we are told of his experiences climbing mountains, exploring remote corners of the world.  Not only has Michael Crichton had several lifetimes of experience, but he tells the stories very well.  Most are very short, but very interesting.<br />I don't think that Travels will be a book that I have any interest in re-reading, but it was a good book to read once and I'm glad I did.  Crichton has a lot of stories to tell and he tells them well.	2003-10-13

Since then I've tried to get my hands on every new biography that has been released.  I finally got a chance to read Roddy Piper's book.  I only saw the tail end of Piper's career in the WWF (back when it was the WWF), missed the WCW era, and was disappointed with his latest brief run with WWE.  I knew the Piper was a legend of the ring and had a long standing feud with Hogan back when the WWF was just starting up with Wrestlemania.  What I didn't know much about was his prior success.<br />Roddy Piper takes us on a little trip starting from when he first broke into wrestling as a teenager.  We follow young Piper as he rises in the ranks and starts bringing in the crowds in territory after territory until he finally lands in the WWF.  Since I have no knowledge of Piper's past, and I do know of his skill on the mic, I can believe it.  It was a different era for wrestling.  Shortly after Piper writes about Wrestlemania II, he talks about the \\"sickness\\" in wrestling that has infected the wrestlers and has influenced their self-destructive lives.  I respect the fact that Roddy Piper did not let himself off the hook in being better (morally) than he was, but it also felt like he was puffing himself up quite a bit, too.<br />Unlike some of the other wrestling biographies, this one did not flow very smoothly.  The quality of writing felt lower than in other books.  The tone fit Piper very well, but the execution made the book feel a little choppy and this made it somewhat less engaging to read.  While I respect the impact that Roddy Piper made on the business, and I remember how entertaining he used to be in the ring and on the mic, I cannot recommend this book.  It just wasn't as interesting as it could have been and after such a long wait to get a chance to read it, it was a let down.	2003-10-13
US	52402330	R24ZTX168SC6WJ	0679740708	164774	Makes Me Wanna Holler: A Young Black Man in America	Books	5	2	5	N	N	one of the best books you'll read in any year	The first thing to say about this is that it is an incredibly powerful book.  The subtitle of the book is \\"A Young Black Man in America\\", so we know that this memoir is going to deal with race and the experience of growing up as a black man in America.  We see prejudice, anger, hate, disappointment, racism, crime, drugs, murder, prison, and how Nathan McCall acts and reacts towards the white establishment in his personal and professional life.  No matter what the ethnicity of the reader, this is a fascinating book.<br />Nathan McCall begins with his childhood and takes the story up through the writing of the book when he is working as a reporter for the Washington Post.  It is painful and difficult story as McCall begins revealing his experiences.  McCall led a very interesting life and his perspective on it is worth the price of admission.  McCall traces his childhood when he was a strong student and not that popular and as he gained popularity and friends, his focus was more on the social aspects of school and the neighborhood than it was on education.  He describes a little bit of the anger black men felt at the time (this would be in the 60's) and the behaviors of his friends towards the few whites that they saw.  McCall and his friends started skipping school and getting into fights and the more they fought, the more respect they gained the neighborhood.  While we know from the fact that McCall writes for the Washington Post that he turned out alright, this is a very bad section of the book for McCall.  He is getting deeper and deeper into street violence and drugs, and sex (there are a couple of horrible things written about sex in the early section of the book).  We know that racism has got him down, but this section was more the neighborhood interaction than the later chapters dealing with prejudice.  It is difficult to remain sympathetic to McCall during this time.<br />As he grows older, he is eventually sent to prison for three years for Armed Robbery (there is a very good description of the difference of race as related to crime: when McCall shot and nearly killed a black man, he was given a month long prison sentence of which he served 8 days.  When he only robbed a white man at gunpoint, he was given 3 years).  The prison section is where race really starts coming into play in McCall's (and other black men) interactions and observations.  Racism really comes into play when McCall is out of prison and is striving to improve his life and not fall back into crime.  His prison record is a factor and his being black affects his job prospects and how people act towards him.  McCall shows us how there is a more subtle form of prejudice than blatant racism when he becomes a working man at a newspaper.<br />The bottom line is that this is an incredibly well written book and should be essential reading for any high school or college aged student.  It gives an intelligent and powerful look at race and one of the many experiences of a black man growing up in America.  Without question this is one of the best books I have read this year (any year) and I cannot recommend it highly enough.(there is a very good description of the difference of race as related to crime: when McCall shot and nearly killed a black man, he was given a month long prison sentence of which he served 8 days.

The story Erdrich tells is one of family and tradition (and an old stove).  The story is told simply and well, and it is peppered with Native American legend and tradition.  For this reason, I wonder if the book would not be better suited to Native children more than non-Native children.  I have read Erdrich's novels, so I have a passing familiarity with terms like \\"Windigo\\", but I'm not sure most non-Native children would and this might confuse them.<br />While I am a fan of Erdrich's other work (including the young adult novel: The Birchbark House), this isn't a book that I would be excited to read to my children (when I have some).  It isn't quite as accessible or has a simplistic enough feel to it.  Maybe I'm not giving children enough credit, but I would recommend something like Alison McGhee's \\"Countdown to Kindergarten\\" over this one.  Instead of this, you might want to give Erdrich's first children's book, \\"Grandmother's Pigeon\\", a try.  It's much better.	2003-10-09
US	52402330	REHDET75EZEMG	0375703918	935323038	Girl in Landscape: A Novel	Books	4	3	4	N	N	interesting book....	I hardly know how to describe this novel.  Lethem is a difficult author to categorize, and Girl in Landscape is even dodgier to quite nail down.  On the surface it is: a science fiction story, a modern day western set on a strange planet, a coming of age story.  The best possible description of this novel is that it is a normal story told on a strange world.  It is easy to be distracted by the setting, a strange world that was formed by the Archbuilders, who built up the society and world and then left, leaving only a remnant from their society.  The world of the Archbuilders is the new frontier, the new western.<br />Pella Marsh is thirteen years old.  Her mother has recently died and the rest of her family is moving to the planet of the Archbuilders.  There are only a handful of other settlers there, people who are there for a variety of reasons.  Some express an interest in the Archbuilders, others a xenophobic fear.  Upon arrival on the planet, the Marsh family is told that they will have have to take pills to conteract the virus in the atmosphere.  The father chooses not to.  The virus does not make Pella ill, but rather makes a change so that, as the Archbuilders say, the children can learn from adults.<br />This is a fascinating story that I hesitate to rank among the best of Lethem.  Even though there is a minimalist western feel to the story, it also almost feels like Lethem is trying to do too much, tell such a branching story that something is lost.  Don't get me wrong, this is a good book and a good story, but compared to Lethem's best, it falls short.	2003-10-08

(Darkover) (Vol 2)	Books	5	7	9	N	N	another excellent Darkover novel	This book is set in one of the earlier time periods of Darkover: The Ages of Chaos.  The heroine of this novel is a girl named Romilly.  Romilly MacAran is the daughter of an important family.  She has her family's gift of laran: the ability to intuitively feel what animals are feeling, thus making it easier to work with them.  In particular, this laran is used with hawks and horses (her family is known for the MacAran gift with hawks).  Because of the strained family dynamic, more pressure is put in Romilly than otherwise might have been.  The eldest son left home to train his laran in a Tower, and this enraged Mikhail MacAran (so much so that mention of laran or the eldest son's name was forbidden).  The heir was a disappointment to Mikhail and he wished that Romilly was a man.  Mikhail tried to push Romilly into a marriage with someone that she found disgusting and unacceptable.  Instead of accepting the marriage, she ran away from home.<br />Romilly disguises herself as a man.  This era of Darkover is extremely patriarchal and women have few rights in society.  Romilly meets up with Dom Carlo and his exile band who are joining the army of the exiled King Carolin.  Though her travels she is learning who she is and who she wants to be.  Romilly also gets to experience some of the prejudice Darkover society presents women.  For a brief while, she also joins the Sisterhood of the Sword, a female/warrior society.  Even while we learn about Romilly we also see more of Darkover and what the society is like.<br />This is a feminist novel in the characterization of Romilly and how she reacts to the men (and world) of Darkover.  It is also a very good novel.  It goes in a different direction from Stormqueen (another novel set in the Ages of Chaos), but is just as rich and just as good.  Darkover is one of the better fanstay worlds and Marion Zimmer Bradley is an excellent writer.  Most, if not all, of the Darkover novels are self-contained, so it is not necessary to read them in any particular order.  Just pick one up and give it a try.  I haven't been disappointed by this series yet.to read them in any particular order.  Just pick one up and give it a try.  I haven't been disappointed by this series yet.	2003-10-03

After letting the book sit on my shelf for more than a year, I finally decided to give The Joy Luck Club a chance.  All I knew is that it had something to do with the Chinese, Amy Tan was a well regarded author, and there was a movie made of the book (which I have not seen).  That's it.  I didn't quite know what to expect and when I saw the chapter list, I saw that there would be multiple narrators (a technique that can work very well).<br />I'll be honest, I don't remember a single character name and even during the book, I had a hard time remembering which character was which.  From the details provided in each chapter's narration, I knew who was talking, but I didn't know the name.  The Joy Luck Club is a story of mothers and daughters.  The Club itself was formed by four Chinese women who had emigrated from China to America (separately) and did not know anyone in the country.  It gave them a chance to become friends and share in each other's lives.  This was perhaps 40 years before the chapters dealing with their children.  One of the members of the original Club died, and her daughter was invited to take her place.  The Club, among other things, sits and plays Mah Jong late into the night and the game requires four players.  Each member of the club and their daughters tell their own stories and the story of their parents.  This reveals both how they came to be where they are and also how they view their family dynamic.  Some are more satisfied with their lives than others, but in all cases the story is intelligent and interesting.<br />This was Amy Tan's first novel and the only one that I have read that she has written.  Already I can tell that Tan is a major talent and an author from whom I look forward to reading her novels.  While The Joy Luck Club will not make my &quot;favorite novels&quot; list, this is still a very, very good novel.  Knowing what the subject matter is, if this interests you, give it a shot.	2003-09-23

I had only read Roths Portnoys Complaint and wasnt too impressed with it.  But, when I found out that there was a movie adaptation of the book I wanted to make sure that I read the book before seeing the movie (books are typically far superior to the film adaptation).  It didnt take long before I was floored. The Human Stain is an exceptional novel and has completely turned around my opinion of Philip Roth.  Without question this is one of the best novels I have read this year.<br />The Human Stain is the story of Coleman Silk, a retired college professor from Athena College.  Coleman retired from his position in the midst of a scandal.  He was accused of making a racist remark in one of his classes towards two students.  The accusation is patently untrue but Coleman was not the most popular man on campus and things began to steamroll out of control until he left the school.  The joke inherent in this accusation is that while Coleman may look like a 71 year old white man, he is actually a black man.  Coleman has spent his professional (and private) life denying who (and what) he is.  In case this concept sounds too fantastic (a black man who looks white trying to hide the fact that he is black), there is a real life corollary in Anatole Broyard, a New York Times book critic.<br />This is the Coleman that we are first introduced to.  He is in a sexual (and not much more) relationship with 34 year old Faunia Farley.  She is illiterate and works as a cleaning lady at Athena College.  This too, is a scandal waiting to happen.  It is this relationship with Faunia that instigates the telling of the story and we are told very early in the novel that Coleman and Faunia do not live for many more months (by early, I mean within 20 pages).  The story is told by writer Nathan Zuckerman.  Zuckerman was told most of what he knows by Coleman.  For quite some time Coleman tried to get Zuckerman to write a book about the events following the alleged racist remark.  The Human Stain (the title of Roths novel as well as Zuckermans book) is not quite the book that Coleman wanted written, but it was a story that Zuckerman felt compelled to tell.  We must remember that everything is shaded by what Zuckerman knows and what he believes.<br />There is a long section in the middle of the book dealing with a young Coleman Silk. We see him in High School and get glimpses of how he became a black man hiding behind his white skin and denying his family and why he would have done such a thing.  This section deals with Coleman being a young boxer and the relationships with women that he engaged in.  For all the power of this book, the section on the young Coleman is the most powerful.  I first expected it to break the rhythm of the story, but it fits perfectly and is one of the best passages in the novel.<br />After being somewhat put off Roth from reading Portnoys Complaint, this book impressed me so much Im looking forward to reading American Pastoral.  I have a hard time imagining that Roth wrote a better book than The Human Stain, but a different novel won the Pulitzer.  Awards aside, The Human Stain is one of the best books I have read all year and is simply exceptional work.  After finishing the book, the best I can say is: wow.  The book really is that good.

Douglas Adams brings Arthur Dent back to Earth after a long trip hitchhiking across the universe.  Yes, Arthur Dent is back on the same Earth that was destroyed by the Vogons to make an intergalactic highway.  Exactly how the Earth and all of its original inhabitants are recreated is teased and hinted at and if you pay attention to what you're reading you'll easily figure out why (more why, than how).<br />Arthur Dent is back on Earth and pretty confused as to exactly how there is an Earth to be back on.  Throughout this novel we learn that all the dolphins are gone (which is old news and no longer newsworthy), and we meet a Rain God, find out what God's Final Message to Creation is, revisit Marvin the robot, and find out that Arthur finds love with a woman named Fenchurch.  That's a whole lot to fit into one book.  On top of that, we have levitation, a small house that walled in the entire ocean, Ford Prefect, and the world's stupidest dog.  All of this is handled with the offbeat humor that we expect from The Hitchhiker's Trilogy.<br />This novel, for a change, focuses on Arthur Dent and takes place almost entirely on Earth.  In this way, it is different from the Universe hopping we got in the first three novels.  In both quality and content, this is a worthy addition to Douglas Adam's Hitchhiker's Trilogy.	2003-09-23

The text of this diary, while personal, is directed at her husband, Peter Wilmot.  Peter is in a coma for having, apparently, tried to commit suicide.  Misty is, and has been for some time, miserable.  She lashes out at Peter in her diary and in the process tells her story of why she is writing this diary and brings her life up to date while telling a very interesting story.<br />Diary examines the life of Misty Kleinman and traces how she got to Waytansea (wait and see, get it?) Island.  Misty was an artist when she first started dating Peter Wilmot.  In a time and a place where every other artist was trying to do art that made some sort of a statement about society (a teddy bear stuffed with feces), Misty was painting landscapes and pictures of buildings.  She was gifted, true, but did not think much of her gift because of what everyone else was doing.  She married Peter, a man that nobody else even wanted to talk to.<br />That is a rough sketch of Misty's origins, but the present day material is much different.  It involves Peter in the coma, strange messages inside people's homes, a centuries old tradition/legend of the Wilmot family and how Misty ties into all of this.  The novel showcases Palahniuk's wit and style but somehow managed to have more substance and heart that his last couple of novels (Choke, Lullaby).  I got the sense that Palahniuk was maturing some as a writer, there is more emotional depth to this work.  Diary is probably Palahniuk's best novel since Survivor.  Diary touches on the theme of the tortured artist (taken to an extreme, as only Palahniuk can do) and the place of the artist in society.

US	52402330	RZLNDBIEFDYCH	0886773105	507789905	StormQueen! (Darkover)	Books	5	7	7	N	N	a deep, rich novel of Darkover's early days	This Darkover novel is set in Darkover's Age of Chaos.  It is set several hundred years after Darkover Landfall.  The ruling powers in Darkover ruled in what feels like a feudal system.  I would compare this period in Darkover's history to the European Dark Ages.  At the beginning of the novel we are introduced to Donal, an 8 year old boy.  Donal is the son of a woman who was the mistress of Mikhail Aldaran, lord of the Aldaran.  Mikhail raises Donal like his own son, despite Donal being the child of another man.  Donal's mother dies giving birth to Dorilys, the only living child of Mikhail.<br />The first section of the novel serves to introduce us to some of the major players of the novel and also works as a perfect setup to describe the world and background of the characters that will act throughout the novel.  The ESP type abilities hinted at in Darkover Landfall exist in a wild, but powerful form.  These abilities are called Laran, and the ruling classes are participating in a breeding program to both harness and control these laran.  This breeding program has a huge flaw and drawback, few children actually live past childhood.  When they start to become in full possession of their laran, death is by far the most common result.  Another common result is emotional instability because of the laran.  This is the world and heritage that Dorilys was born into.  After she was born the novel skips ahead 11 years.  Donal is now a man and beloved by Mikhail.  Dorilys is a spoiled child with a wildly powerful laran.<br />This novel deals with the personal implications of the laran breeding plan as well as how the feudalistic society plays out in Darkover.  Dorilys has been handfasted (or, betrothed) but since she has no control over her laran, when she gets frightened she lashes out with her power and unintentionally kills with it.  Donal wants to marry Renata, but the circumstances with Aldaran force him into a different alliance.  Renata was sent by the nearby Tower (where those with Laran work with their power) to help train Dorilys to control her laran.  We are also introduced to Allart, a former monk but potential heir to the throne at Thendara.  He has been hiding away trying to control his laran (he has the ability to see all possible futures resulting from every action and potential action), but is involved in this story, too.<br />While Darkover Landfall was little more than an introduction to the world of Darkover and how it was founded, Stormqueen! was a much richer novel.  In this novel, Bradley gives us a sense of the world and strong, well written characters.  It was easy to get wrapped up in the story, and it was intense at times.  Reading Stormqueen only confirmed my desire to keep reading the Darkover series.  Excellent fantasy novel.r (where those with Laran work with their power) to help train Dorilys to control her laran.

With the exception of Without Remorse (which detailed the origins of John Clark), Clancy's novels have been fairly chronological.  Red Rabbit takes to a time shortly after Patriot Games but still before the events in Red October.  Jack Ryan has only recently joined the CIA (instead of being President as he was in Bear and the Dragon).  He is assigned a job in London working as an analyst and assisting the British Intelligence Agency (MI-6).  Much of Ryan's part in Red Rabbit involves what is little more than an introduction to his character....a character that we are already well familiar with by this point.  I suppose Clancy is showing us how Ryan became the man we meet in later books, but to me it felt like unnecessary exposition.<br />The main thrust of the story involves a Soviet (because we are now back in the early 80's during the Reagan administration) plot to kill the Pope.  This links up with the true life attempt of the life of the pontiff and since none of the other Jack Ryan novels references an assassination of the Pope, we know from the start what the end is.  This removes most, if not all, of the dramatic tension in the novel.  What is interesting about this book is not the plotting to kill the Pope, or even Jack Ryan's section of the novel, but rather with the tension involved with the conscience of a Soviet KGB Communications Officer who learns of the plot.  This ties in with Ed and Mary Pat Foley, who are the only interesting American characters in the book.  Readers will recognize the Foleys from previous Clancy novels.  As they are active participants in the novel (unlike Jack Ryan), their part is interesting both as narrative as well as for the characters themselves.<br />To be perfectly honest, this is a very weak offering from Tom Clancy.  I expect more from him because he has raised the bar awfully high. I can only recommend this book to fans of Clancy who wish to read the entire Jack Ryan series, but even for these people I must recommend that they go in with low expectations...maybe they will be surprised.  As for me, I look forward to reading Teeth of the Tiger and hope that it is a return to form for Tom Clancy.tire Jack Ryan series, but even for these people I must recommend that they go in with low expectations...maybe they will be surprised.

Here we are introduced to the founders of Darkover.  We see how humans first came to the planet, and how they began to adapt to their new surroundings.  Unlike many other fantasy series, humans were not created on Darkover, but rather there was a space ship on a trip to begin a colony on another planet when the ship had troubles and crashed on an uncharted planet.  Granted, that is not a terribly original idea either, but the how Bradley treats the topic is very original, and very well done.<br />The crew is faced with the dilemma of whether to try to rebuild the ship (which will take several years at best) or to try to settle in and adapt on the unnamed planet (the planet does not get the name Darkover for at least a hundred years of its history).  The crew and colonists are divided on this.  Before anything else can be done there must be preliminary exploration of the planet so that they will be able to survive for as many years as necessary and also because if they are to be trapped on the planet for a while they must know what kind of planet it is.<br />We are given glimpses of an ESP power that will be refined throughout the series and are introduced to an alien (though native to Darkover) race.  We are shown the Ghost Wind, which induces humans to release their inhibitions.  ...<br />This novel serves as an introduction to Darkover (I believe it was the first novel in the series that I read years ago) as well as an important time in the history of Darkover (obviously, it is the founding).  Darkover Landfall may not be the best novel in the series, but it provided enough interest for me to want to read more in the series.	2003-09-12

Grianne Ohmsford, formerly the Ilse Witch is now the High Druid (Ard Rhys) of the Third Druid Council at Paranor.  Grianne faces the problem of how to make the Druid Council relevant and effective in the Four Lands.  She faces skepticism from the Elves and some men, and worse, she faces schemes from some of the Druids who still do not trust her because of her past.  These schemes get the best of Grianne early in the book as she is trapped in some alternate realm similar to her own world (I refuse to name it because it is a massive spoiler and there is some joy in discovering where exactly Grianne ended up).<br />This sets up the main thrust of the novel which is the beginning of the quest to rescue Grianne.  We are introduced to the hero of the novel, Pen Ohmsford.  Brooks follows the formula of the Shannara series in that a new scion of the Ohmsford clan is tapped to undertake a quest of some sort.  While Pen's father, Bek Ohmsford (from the Voyage trilogy) is alive and able, The King of the Silver River maintains that it is young Pen who must venture out to rescue his aunt (Grianne is Bek's sister).  While Bek and Grianne have the magic of the Wishsong, Pen is a generation that has been skipped (though he wonders if the magic is just dying out).  He does have his own magic, one that he does not think is as important or powerful as the Wishsong.  He can empathetically understand animals.  Helping Pen out in this quest are Ahren Elessedil (an elf Prince and Druid), his niece and apprentice Khyber Elessedil, and Grianne's dwarf assistant.  This first volume in the High Druid trilogy sets up the main thrust of the series and offers an excellent continuation of the Voyage trilogy.<br />This is the best work Brooks has done in years (at least in the Shannara series) and is far better than any of the three books in the Voyage trilogy.  The most interesting parts of the book deal with Grianne (which is a little unfortunate since the main focus is on Pen).  She is more of an interesting character, more developed, and her circumstances are fascinating for any long time fan of Shannara.  This book kept me turning the pages faster and faster because I wanted to know what happened next and I found myself eagerly awaiting Book 2 in the High Druid series.

In the simplistic sense it is the story of a seagull who is exiled from the flock because of unseagull like tendencies.  Jonathon was a seagull who dreams of flying, not like the other gulls, but to the full extent of his potential.  He wants to be better, to fly better and this is contrary to the nature of the flock.  He doesn't fit in and he is exiled for it.  After the exile he discovers that there is an entirely different world out there with gulls who are also trying to reach their potential.  He becomes part of this world and tries to teach other gulls to not just follow the flock but rather to excel and be a better gull.  This is the simple explanation of the story.<br />This is also not all there is to the story of Jonathon Livingston Seagull.  This is a fable for us to learn a lesson from.  Richard Bach is telling us that we can be like Jonathon Seagull.  He is telling us that we must still seek our higher ambition even if our friends and family don't understand or try to hold us back.  This is a very relevant book for today (even though it was written 30 years ago).  Call it a fable, call it a parable, this is a good book to read and should even be on some required reading lists.	2003-09-09

Short story collections winning the Pulitzer are rare, just about as rare as a debut winning the prize.  This is the debut collection from Jhumpa Lahiri (who has a novel coming out in Sept 2003) and after reading it, I feel that it is definitely worth reading and deserving of the Pulitzer.<br />It is obvious that all of the stories are of a high quality, but there were some that stood out more than others.  \\"The Third and Final Continent\\" is probably the best of the collection and is simply a stunning story that I did not quite want to end.  \\"Sexy\\" is a story dealing with adultery and a woman in a relationship with a married man because he makes her feel sexy.  The title story and \\"A Temporary Matter\\" are also excellent stories.<br />Lahiri's stories all deal with Indians (native to India) and the every day life they live.  Most of the stories are set in America with expatriates, but a couple of stories are set in India.  More noticeably, these are all human stories and Lahiri captures life so perfectly that we feel that we are living these stories.  Even so early in her career, Jhumpa Lahiri is already a master of her craft.  Highly recommended.	2003-09-08

The book continues to follow Lorn, an officer in Cyador's Mirror Lancers.  Chronologically, this is the second book in the Recluse series and is still a good 400 years before the events in Fall of Angels.  Lorn begins the story as Over-Captain of a port city.  As with all of his postings, Lorn is assigned it so that he may fail and be killed.  Lorn has been given the most difficult assignments that exist in Cyador.  He was a student Magus, but his aptitude led him to be assigned to the Lancers.  Those in power in Cyador find Lorn to be a potential threat, but Lorn keeps surviving by being smarter, luckier, and more ruthless than those who oppose him, and so he works his way up the chain of command of the Mirror Lancers.<br />If Magi'i was more of an action/adventure book with some intrigue, Scion is the opposite.  Sure, there is action, and battles, but this book deals more with political intrigue and moral decisions (and ambivalence) and political infighting.  Lorn has to play the game in order to survive, all the while he only wants to stay alive and be with his merchanter consort, Ryalth.  As Lorn's fortunes rise in the Mirror Lancers, so does Ryalth's success with the Ryalor trading house.  Because she is a lady trader, she is also not completely accepted by the current powers in Cyador.  Lorn would, and does do everything he can protect himself, his family and especially Ryalth.  This does not exclude murder...he views it more as pre-emptive self defense rather than cold blooded murder, but Lorn does what he feels he has to do.  He isn't quite as much of a sympathetic protagonist as is Lerris or Creslin, but he is still in their mold.<br />As the novel progresses, the stakes keep raising as Lorn gains military rank and as the current emperor is closer to dying.  His battles get tougher, larger, and carry much greater risk to his life, his career, and to Cyador.  The novel follows the logical progression of Lorn's career and everything that happens feels like that is the logical next step.  Part of the reason for that is probably because of the nature of the Recluse series.  Each protagonist is put in very similar circumstances to other protagonists in the series.  They do exactly what needs to be done to survive, are called Cold-Blooded because the do so, and end up doing similar actions in their quest to survive and have a quiet life.  Lerris, Creslin, Justin, and Nylan are all very similar to Lorn in this way.  Modesitt's novels are very formulaic in that manner.  If you try to read them all in a row, they become very tiresome because you are really reading the same exact story being told over and over again.  However, if you read a book or two and take a break for several months before continuing with the series, you may find Recluse easier to digest.

US	52402330	R17MRCKCPH9WNQ	0375415505	22428470	Tietam Brown	Books	4	1	1	N	N	a definate page turner	Tietam Brown is the first novel by author and former professional wrestler Mick Foley (Have a Nice Day, Foley is Good).  If you have read either of his autobiographies, you will have an idea of the writing style.  It is clear writing and a fast moving book.  The story is fairly interesting, though a little gruesome and crass.  For as kind and gentle a man as Mick Foley is in real life, this is a fairly twisted book.<br />The book follows Antietam Brown (named after the Civil War battle), a not so popular high school kid with one ear and only one working hand.  He goes by the nickname, Andy.  Andy somehow manages to get the best looking girl in school to be his girlfriend (he made her laugh).  While I might have expected the book to be about Andy and his girlfriend and his life at school, instead we have a father/son story.  Andy's father, also named Antietam Brown, is an absolute pig.  He is a womanizer who gets women to do degrading sexual acts all the while Andy can hear what is going on from his room.  Andy also has to deal with a physically abusive teacher who is also the football coach and can do no wrong in the eyes of the school/town, as well as other horrors of high school.<br />Tietam Brown is an exaggerated story of life and family, but the focus is on the family.  Andy is a very likable character.  Amazingly enough, even the horrible characters in the book (including the father) are somehow sympathetic enough that I cared what happened to them.  Some very ugly stuff happens in this book, but Foley tells the story well enough that we can understand it is as forming the character without dwelling too much on it.  The book has been accused of being amateurish, and that it is too crass, and too disgusting, and I'll be the first to admit that at times, it is (Mick would probably also admit it).  However, the book is also highly entertaining and a very quick and easy read.  This isn't something that I would buy, but it was a fun book to read.	2003-08-22

I decided to give this book a chance because Louise Erdrich is my favorite author and I'll read anything she writes.  I had no idea what to expect from this book.  I knew that it was a travel memoir of Erdrich's trip to Rainy Island at Lake of the Woods.<br />Rainy Island once belonged to explorer Ernest Oberholtzer.  Ober, as Erdrich refers to him, was a book collector (among other things).  The Island has many cabins that are just filled with books.  Since Louise Erdrich is Ojibwe, an author, and a bookseller, this is the type of journey that fits right into her life.  We begin the book as she is just arriving up in Northern Minnesota and Erdrich is meeting up with the father of her youngest daughter.  Erdrich writes about the Ojibwe, this man's place in the culture (he is a spiritual leader), her daughter, the Ojibwe language, and why she is making this trip.<br />I might expect a travel memoir to focus completely on the journey,  but Erdrich deviates from this and talks about everything that influences the trip and the history of the northern Ojibwe and the islands.  Erdrich writes about the oral traditions of the Ojibwe and weaves the story of her trip into the narrative.<br />On one hand this is a fascinating journey, but a warning to the reader: this is not like her fiction.  This is a slow moving history of Edrich's trip to Rainy Island and a history of the Ojibwe from the Lake of the Woods.  This is an interesting book, but it might not be for everyone.	2003-08-15

I know that all three of these books are based on video games, and this does hurt the storytelling somewhat, but Feist was way too obvious with this book (I am not kidding you, there was a \\"rescue the baby\\" side-quest).  I'm a longtime fan of the Riftwar Universe, and I'm looking forward to new books in Feist's new series, but this was just a bad book.<br />Here's the story: Every ten years the Temple of Ishap replaces its most holy object, The Tear of the Gods.  The Tear is a mystic gem that allows communication with the gods.  Supposedly, if the Tear fails without a replacement there will be ten years with no hope because humanity will be shut off from the gods until a new Tear can be formed (a process that takes a decade).  The Tear is being transported by ship when the ship is raided by pirates, including one bad man named Bear.<br />There are still problems in Krondor as someone is trying to throw the Western Realm into chaos.  Jazhara, the new court magician for Prince Arutha is arriving in the city and Squire James is sent to escort her to the palace.  On the way they get involved in several escapades involving some nasty acts taking place.  As the story progresses Feist brings together the continuing troubles in Krondor with the search for Bear and the Tear of the Gods.<br />Like the other two books, this book is filled to the brim with action (as you might expect from a video game adaption).  Some of it works, other times it just feels forced.  Unlike Krondor: The Assassins, or even Krondor: The Betrayal (to a lesser extent), Tear of the Gods did not feel like it really had a coherent story.  The characters were moved from place to place, but there was none of the depth that I have come to expect from Raymond Feist and his Riftwar series.  Even considering this was part of a lesser series from Feist, I was still disappointed by Tear of the Gods.  Video games and novels are two different mediums, and this felt like too much of a video game RPG plot (complete with side quests, mini-bosses, and boss strategies).  Feist still has two more books planned in the Riftwar Legacy series, and hopefully they will be better than this offering.f the Gods.

What you get out of this book will be dependent on what you are looking for.  There are several different ways to read the book.  Personally, I found some of the book to be of value to my situation and most of the book to be interesting but not necessarily applicable.  So, the first and main question is: Why are you reading this book?  If you are like me, you read this book to give you tips on how to help make a \\"moving in together\\" situation work out better.  This book did provide tips and hints, and while they may seem obvious when you read them, it is good to be reminded.  If you are unsure whether or not moving in together is a good thing, this book will give you things to look for in yourself and in your partner to decide if this is a good idea.<br />The book is broken up into several sections.  At the very start of the book, it feels like the author is simply giving us a history of cohabitating and how it affects/influences marriage.  This moves into a discussion on reasons why people move in together and a reminder to think about why we want to move in.  The author discusses (and gives examples of) relationships and situations where cohabitating works and when it failed.  If you finally decide to move in together there are several chapters that I found very valuable.  My girlfriend and I have already decided to move in together.  We know that it is important to have clearly defined goals and expectations for the relationship and moving in together (this is pretty much the point of the book, to define and agree on what to expect from cohabitating).  There is a chapter on etiquette for cohabitating, and while it is simple and the author lists small things, I think that the small points of etiquette will become very important over the long run in just keeping things sane and neat and agreeable for your partner.  Finally, the book moves onto what happens when cohabitating fails and how to cleanly get out of the apartment/relationship...and then, oddly enough, the book has a small section on marriage (right after the breaking up section).<br />As I said, there is value in this book, and if you have already decided to move in with your partner, there are several sections of the book that will be very useful in looking over, just to remind yourself that you have to do the small things to help make the relationship and living situation successful.  First decide why you want to read this book and what you want to get out of it, and you may have a better experience in reading it.  Other reviewers have mentioned that there is a bias against cohabitating (rather than marriage), and this is true.  The author tries to back it up with statistics and data, but the bias remains.  However (and this will be my last comment), one of the most successful couples that Rosen gives an example of was one that cohabitated with no interest in getting married...but they both had the same expectation for the relationshiphe book has a small section on marriage (right after the breaking up section). <br />As I said, there is value in this book, and if you have already decided to move in with your partner, there are several sections of the book that will be very useful in looking over, just to remind yourself that you have to do the small things to help make the relationship and living situation successful.

The Deryni series is one of my all time favorites, but Deryni Tales is fan fiction.  I don't normally read fan fiction, but it appears that with Katherine Kurtz herself editing the collection, these stories are now part of the Deryni canon.  This was important to me as I did not want to read anything that did not officially fit into the Deryni canon.<br />I'm glad that I did read these stories.  While nothing major happens (as far as affecting any of Kurtz's storylines or characters), but it does shed some light on events throughout the Deryni history.  Surprisingly enough, some of these stories are just as good as anything Katherine Kurtz might have written.  Some she claims to wish that she had written them.  There are several stories that I thought were simply excellent: \\"Lovers of Shadows\\", \\"A Midsummer's Questing\\", \\"Arilan the Talmud Student\\", \\"The Green Tower\\", and \\"Dhugal at Court\\".  Okay, I see that this is more than a couple stories.  I'm not sure there is really a weak link in this collection.  The only disappointment for me was that there was only one story set in the era of Joram and Evaine (A Midsummer's Questing\\").  Hopefully there will be future volumes of Deryni Tales that will further illuminate the world that Katherine Kurtz has created.  If the fan fiction she publishes is this good, I will gladly accept more while I wait for Kurtz to publish another novel of her own.  Highly recommended for fans of the Deryni.	2003-08-08

The legend that was the most familiar to me was the one that states that if you are in college and your roommate commits suicide you will get an automatic 4.0 Grade Point Average for the year.  There were others that I heard as jokes, and some that were presented as real.<br />Jan Brunvand is a columnist who specializes in urban legends.  He has put together a collection of legends in this book and he has organized them into several subject headings: Horrors, Automobile Legends, Animal Legends, Other Legends of Accidents and Mishaps, Sex and Scandal Legends, Business/Professional/and Government Legends, and Academic Legends.  By far, my favorite section of the book was the one with the academic legends.  I don't know if it was because I am still close enough in age to the college years that I still appreciate some of the legends and myths, but I found those to be the most entertaining.<br />The format of each essay is that Brunvand identifies the legend, tells the main story of the legend, and then tries to trace the origins of the legend.  Sometimes we find out that there is a true life story behind the legend, and it just got twisted in the retelling, and other times we simply learn that nothing like that ever happened, even though it feels like it could have.  Naturally, some legends are more interesting than others.  As a whole, this was a very interesting book and it exposed me to some urban legends that I'm sure to recognize when I hear them.  This book is worth reading.	2003-08-07

This book feels more like a story rather than a series of action scenes slapped together and called Midkemia.  The book opens shortly after The Betrayal and advances the story of something/someone threatening the kingdom.  Squire James has more of a role in this book, as does Prince Arutha.  For the first time in the series, William (the son of Pug) has a major starring role.<br />Something bad is going on in Krondor.  There are mysterious murders occurring in the city, but instead of it being nobles or common folk, it seems that a lot of criminals are being killed.  This wouldn't raise up a red flag, except that they are members of the Guild of Thieves: The Mockers.  James is sent to investigate and learns that the Mockers have been overrun by a gang ruled by someone known as The Crawler.  The leader of the Mockers, The Upright Man, is presumed dead and James suspects this is part of a plot not only against the Mockers but against the Prince as well.  Someone is stirring up trouble.<br />At the same time, the Duke of Olasko (a duchy later appearing in The Conclave of Shadows series set a century later) is passing through and visits Krondor.  He wants to hunt, so Arutha assigns William and some other soliders to escort the Duke.  During the hunting trip they are attacked and it seems that someone is trying to start a war between Krondor and Olasko (or the Kingdom of the Isles, and the East).  This raises the stakes even more as this mysterious enemy is fighting on several fronts.<br />Krondor: The Assassins deals with the fight to save Krondor from within as well as stop those trying to kill the Duke of Olasko and prevent a war.  As I said, this was much better than Krondor: The Betrayal, and while it doesn't measure up close to Feist's other work like the Riftwar Saga, this was a fairly enjoyable read.  It is a step back in the right direction, at the least.direction, at the least.	2003-08-04
US	52402330	R2QCPAQH02HWGC	0385413726	244095611	From Beirut to Jerusalem	Books	5	12	15	N	N	a fantastic look at Israel, Palestine, and the Middle East	I had this book on my \\"to read\\" list for about a year, and then it sat on my shelf for five months after buying it before I finally got around to reading it.  Now that I have finished the book I have to wonder what took me so long.  The book is exceptional.  From Beirut to Jerusalem is the story of Thomas Friedman and his analysis of the Palestine/Israel conflict.  Friedman is a three time Pulitzer Prize winning reporter and this book presents and even handed and fair look at both the Palestinians and the Israelis.  The book is broken up into three sections: Beirut, Jerusalem, and Washington.<br />Beirut is the story of the Palestinians.  When Friedman was a young reporter, he was assigned a beat in Beirut (the newspaper made a point to assign a Jewish reporter to cover Beirut).  Friedman does a good job showing exactly how the PLO came to power and the importance (and the flaw) of Yasir Arafat in the Palestinian movement.  Despite being Jewish himself, Friedman does not present much of a bias against the Palestinians in his reporting.  Friedman shows how there truly is no central authority for the Palestinians and how amazing it is the Arafat was able to unify the PLO into any sort of centralized body.  The one thing that surprised me was how the Palestinians (and Beirut as a whole) was essential tribal politics.  Beirut was an example of what can go right in having a disparate group of Christians, Jews, and Muslims live together in a Middle Eastern city.  Beirut also ended up being a disaster of what can go wrong: everything.  When push came to shove, the different groups split apart, formed militias and held fast to tribal lines.  It was in Beirut that the PLO found a temporary home (at least until Israel pushed north).<br />Jerusalem is the story of the Jews.  We all know the story of how after World War II the Jews were given a state in the Middle East and it was on their traditional homeland of Israel.  This displaced the Arabs (Palestinians) that were living on the land at the time.  Friedman discusses the Utopian vision that Israel is because of the religious context for the Jews.  The interesting thing is that Israel was very nearly formed as a secular state for the diaspora Jews, and it was only the Orthodox and Ultra-Orthodox Jews that initially held onto their religion (rather than their culture).  American Jews viewed Israel truly as the Promised Land, and the Christian world saw Israel through the tinted glasses of the Old Testament.  Surrounded on all sides by Arabs who do not want the Jews in Israel, the nation has never truly been at peace and it is in this section of the book that Friedman shows just how difficult peace in the region is.<br />Washington is the end of the book and Friedman ties several things together.  There was a very clear progression from Beirut to Jerusalem as Friedman was transferred over to Jerusalem, but at the same time I felt that Friedman presented enough material that I could begin to understand the context of Jerusalem.  Thomas Friedman presents his thoughts on how diplomacy could possibly work for the Israelis and the Palestinians (using the Egypt/Israel peace as a model), and also further explains just how complex the relationships are in the Middle East.  We get to see the attempts of the United States to broker peace deals, and how these succeeded and failed, and in some cases, why.  Friedman discusses the role the United States does play, and perhaps should play in the region (at least as it affects Israel and Palestine).<br />This is an absolutely fascinating book.  Obviously, this should be used as a primer on the subject and if one feels interested, should lead into further research into the region, but this was a very informative and interesting book and while I was confused at times by the complexity of the situation and shocked at the enormity of the problem, I also felt that I read a valuable book on the region.  I thought this was an excellent book and it should belong on any \\"must read\\" list for books on the Middle East.ld belong on any \\"must read\\" list for books on the Middle East.	2003-08-04

As a former collegiate cross country runner (NAIA Division II), I am very interested in any book that focuses on cross country, and the fact that this is of an elite squad filled with interesting men makes the reading all the more entertaining.  While the subject of the book is the entire team, Chris Lear focuses the most on Coach Mark Wetmore and Senior Adam Goucher.  Chris Lear follows the team from their arrival on campus for preseason practice all the way through injuries and tragedy up through the NCAA National Championship meet.<br />Adam Goucher is the elite runner of the men's squad.  He placed second at nationals as a freshman and has spent the next two years trying unsuccessfully to win the race.  This season is his last chance at winning the National Meet and is one of his last chances to ensure financial security through running (winning the National Championship will all but ensure major sponsorship so that he can be paid to continue running at the elite level).  While Goucher trains with the team, he also trains at a higher level than the cross country team, so much of his training is by himself because of the intensity of training.  We see Goucher progress through the season, tested by Wetmore's high mileage training and by the high cost this training is taking on his body as the season wears on.<br />Mark Wetmore is the coach of the Colorado Cross Country team, and ever since he first started coaching at Colorado, he has preached a high intensity, high mileage regimen for his men.  He trains them hard so that when it comes time to race he knows that their bodies are capable of what they will have to do.  He is tough, but effective.  He demands discipline as there are many who want to be in contention for the National title, but they must be willing to put in the work.<br />While Goucher and Wetmore are given extra attention, Chris Lear gives sufficient time to the other runners on the squad.  We get to get a glimpse of who these men are and their personalities start to shine through.  The season starts with so much promise, but injuries start getting in the way, and late in the season one of the runners dies in a biking accident.  Lear shows how everything affects the team and how they deal with the season and the loss of a friend.<br />I don't know if Running With the Buffaloes would be interesting to everyone, but I found this book to be fascinating.  It gives a very good look into an elite collegiate squad, and for anyone interested in running or just reading a very interesting story that happens to deal with sport in general and cross country in specific, this is the book to read.gives sufficient time to the other runners on the squad.

Naked Empire begins shortly after the end of Pillars of Creation.  By shortly after I mean within a couple of hours in the timeline of the series.  Jennsen has finally met up with Richard and has learned that she is his half-sister and that Richard really is a good guy (something we've known for the 6 books before POC).  We have learned something about Jennsen.  She is what is called \\"pristinely ungifted\\".  This means that she cannot see magic nor can it directly affect her.  The reason for this has to do with the Rahl family, but it would take several paragraphs to explain.  With Jennsen together with Richard and Kahlan, they can continue their quest deep into the Empire of the Old World.<br />That's the set up.  Here's the delivery:<br />Richard is being tracked by strange, large black birds called races.  The races are not doing much more than following (a rare attack), so Richard knows that someone is using the races to find out where he is going and what he is doing.  Talking with Kahlan he mentions a book he was reading called \\"The Pillars of Creation\\", and it has to do with the Pristinely Ungifted like Jennsen.  Apparently there was a whole lot of them several thousand years ago and they were all banished to the Old World.  That's all anyone really knows about them.  Naturally, this means that we're going to see their descendents (they are actually the Empire in the title, not that of Jagang).  Richard is also suffering from extreme headaches that reflect the growing of Richard's gift.<br />Richard and company meet up with an old man who tries to convince Richard to save his people from the Empire.  Richard explains that he only explains the options to people and exhorts them to rise up themselves because Richard cannot do everything himself nor does he feel the responsibility to help those who won't help themselves.  Richard preaches self-empowerment.  The man doesn't quite understand and it is revealed that he poisoned Richard to convince him to save his people.<br />You can guess how this plays out and who this man's people actually are.  Now that we are back to the main storyline, things get moving along a little bit more.  The point of view switches between Richard in the Old World and Zedd back in the New World.  One of my favorite things about this series (in a very twisted way) is how Terry Goodkind does not spare his characters anything.  They must endure torture and extreme suffering and in the end we still believe it when they are able to overcome the situation they find themselves in.  The only question I have is something that has been questioned in other series: Will it ever end?  I don't see where Goodkind is going with the Sword of Truth series and I don't see that it is really moving to a resolution anytime soon.  On the other hand, this is also a series that can be wrapped up in any one book.  The amazing thing about this series is that every single book is a self-contained novel that has its own story arc while it advances the series story arc.

Long before Creslin founded Recluce, long before the angels fell and Nylan built Westwind, long before all of the recorded history of Recluse there was the Empire of Cyador.  Cyador is an Empire built on the power of Chaos mages and Chaos towers (supplying the Chaos energy required for much of the technology of Cyador).  The Empire uses the army (Lancers) to hold back the barbarians from Cyador as well as hold the Accursed Forest (the forest that the Druids are later from) back from spreading into Cyador.<br />Lorn is a son of a Magi family.  He is one of the most talented and proficient students in his classes, but he lacks the love of chaos that is necessary to become a Magi.  Lorn can do the work better than perhaps anyone and is capable of being a Chaos Master, but he isnt obsessed with it nor does he truly love Chaos.  If you have read other Recluce novels, you know this will lead to Lorns exile from his family and the city of Cyad.  This is most similar to Lerris being exiled from Recluse and going on the Dangergeld (The Magic of Recluce).  The difference is that Lorn knows why he must leave Cyad, where he is going, and what the risks are.  Lorn is made a Lancer undercaptain and must fight on the frontier of Cyad against barbarians.  Lancers have a low survival rate, Magi Lancers have an even lower survival rate because they get the most difficult assignments (so that they will be killed.  A personal capable of wielding chaos but not a magus is too dangerous to the Empire, or so the higher ups have decided).  Lorn knows what he is getting into, but actually becoming a Lancer is the only way that he sees to live.<br />Lorn is essentially a moral, honest man, but at the same time he is ruthless in protecting himself and his loved ones from threats, both real and perceived.  If Lorn sees someone as a threat, he will kill that man but hide the crime in such a way that nobody is sure who committed the murder (and in some cases that a murder even took place).  He is a very guarded individual, mostly because he knows that the Magii in Cyad do not want him to live, despite his family connections.<br />The more you read in Recluce you will begin to see that Modesitt is essentially telling the same type of story over and over again.  You can see clear comparisons between Lorn, Creslin, Nylan, and Lerris.  There is the recurring theme of exile, and the protagonist trying to find his destiny without quite knowing how he will accomplish it.  In one sense, if you have read one Recluce novel you pretty much know how the other ones will work out.  Magii of Cyador is slightly different in that Lorn has more knowledge and intent in his actions, but the book still follows the basic pattern that Modesitt set up in the first Recluce novel.  That said, this remains one of my favorite fantasy series because of the depth of development in the created world and in the characters.  We get to see what the characters are thinking, why they are planning their actions, and what the repercussions are of those actions.  Modesitt is not gentle towards the protagonists, they suffer more than any other character in the books, and maybe thats part of why I like the books so much.  My one suggestion is to take breaks between the books or you can get tired of the repetition fairly quickly.t man but hide the crime in such a way that nobody is sure who committed the murder (and in some cases that a murder even took place).

Book 1 of the Riftwar Legacy<br />Originally this book was a computer game, but Raymond Feist decided that he wanted to make a novel about it.  He took the core story, eliminated some of the sillier side quests that RPGs are known for and wrote the book.  The book has turned out to be the weakest in the world of the Riftwar.  The characters, including those that were favorites and well known from the Riftwar Saga, just feel to be flat and not nearly as interesting as they were in the earlier novels.  The time frame of this book comes about ten years after A Darkness at Sethanon (Princess Anita is pregnant with Nicholas) and several years before A Prince of the Blood.<br />Krondor: The Betrayal introduces two new characters that will serve as the protagonists: Owyn, a magician and Gorath, a Dark Elf.  We also get to revisit Locklear, Jimmy, Pug, and Arutha and other minor characters who appear in the Riftwar Saga.  Locklear is on patrol in the Northern lands of the Kingdom and comes across a band of moredhel chasing someone.  Upon being rescued, that someone turns out to be Gorath, a moredhel himself.  He has an urgent message for Prince Arutha: Murmandamus lives!  Murmandamus was the big bad in A Darkness at Sethanon and was killed at that city.  The threat, rumor, risk that he might be alive, or that the moredhel could believe that, is cause for alarm and Arutha immediately sends Jimmy and Locklear (with Owyn and Gorath) to investigate while Arutha marshals the armies.<br />This is a book filled with action and not so much with character development or even much characterization.  I can imagine that this book would only appeal to fans of the Riftwar Saga as we get to see favorite characters in the prime of their lives (and still alive, for some of them).  The book still reads like a video game and you are going from place to place with lots of small battles and several bigger ones and as a whole, this was a much weaker offering by Raymond Feist.  I blame this on the fact that he is converting a game to a book and it just didnt work extremely well.  I enjoyed getting to see my favorite characters again, but they didnt feel as real or as well drawn as they are in other novels.n the fact that he is converting a game to a book and it just didnt work extremely well.

While the Ender Quartet was complete, Card wrote Ender's Shadow as a parallel novel that focuses on smallest boy in Battle School: Bean.  Shadow Puppets is the sequel to Shadow of the Hegemon.<br />Shadow Puppets follows Bean, a Battle School graduate and one of the heroes of the Formic War that saved the planet from the Buggers.  In Shadow of the Hegemon we watched as all of the remaining Battle School graduates were kidnapped except for Bean who managed to escape.  Behind it all was Achilles, a murderer who Bean knew before Battle School.  Achilles had started several wars but by the end of Shadow of the Hegemon he was in a Chinese prison.  Shadow Puppets has Achilles rescued by the Hegemon as Peter Wiggin believes he can learn from Achilles.  Bean and Petra decide that it is time to leave the Hegemony and begin a life on the run.  They know that Achilles cannot be trusted and that their lives are in jeopardy.  Bean also has to deal with the fact that he knows that he will die soon.  What caused Bean to be so small as a young child and so intelligent also means that he is growing at an alarming rate and will grow so large that his organs will not be able to cope and will just shut down.<br />I enjoyed this trip back into the Ender Universe, and these are familiar characters that I enjoyed reading about.  However, to be perfectly honest and fair, I also thought this was the weakest of the three Shadow novels (as well as the weakest of the 7 in the Ender Universe).  I'm not entirely sure what it was, but the novel wasn't as interesting as the last too, nor was there as much tension.  By this point I simply expect everyone to survive and for Peter to regain control over the Hegemony.  Orson Scott Card is a good writer, but this one is not one of his best.  It isn't quite a let down, but it isn't a thrill..	2003-07-14

Role Playing Games are the ones that need the guides more than others.  The games tend to be longer, more involved, and often encompass little secrets that you might not catch the first time through the game.  This is the strategy guide for the recent Playstation game Final Fantasy Origins.  Final Fantasy Origins contains two games: Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II.  Final Fantasy was first released on the NES during the late 80's and Final Fantasy II was only released in Japan, never America.<br />Final Fantasy:  The original Final Fantasy is one of the more straightforward games in the series, but a guide does offer some help.  To know what to do next, you have to pay attention to a lot of the clues given by townspeople (plus some trial and error).  This guide shows you where to go next and gives a complete spell/item/equipment list for each town.  Since you can only learn 3 of the 4 spells available for each of the 8 spell levels, the guide suggests which spells are the most valuable and which ones do not really matter.  The guide also includes dungeon maps and shows exactly where each treasure chest is and what is inside it.  The guide gives strategy for the bosses and information on what enemies to expect.  There is also a complete bestiary for the game and bestiaries for each dungeon.  This is a fairly complete guide.  I only have two minor complaints.  One: the dungeon maps are fairly small, so you must look closely to see if there are any barriers to go around.  Also, the maps do not clearly layout which floor is which on the map.  Two: the guide does not suggest which level you should be at for each dungeon.  It does this once or twice near the beginning, but a recommended level would be nice.  These are only minor complaints, and for Final Fantasy, this is an excellent guide.<br />Final Fantasy II:  The strategy guide was incredibly helpful for this game.  Because of the level up system that increases stats through battle rather than experience, increasing the stats of your characters is a little trickier.  This guide offers tips for different ways to do this (one of the more helpful is using the Swap spell from Mysidia on weak enemies from near Altair).  Throughout the guide there are screenshots of the characters battling the bosses and this provides a helpful guide to see how many HP you should have at each stage of the game.  That was very useful for me.  The walkthrough was helpful and allowed me to find every treasure chest and item in the game as well as breeze my way through the dungeons without getting lost.  The guide provided some boss strategy, though the two most helpful tips was learning the elemental weakness of the boss, and using the Blood Swords (the Blood Sword made the bosses a LOT easier).  I have two negatives: One: Near the end of the game, some of the stairs are marked incorrectly on the map and it made things a little bit more difficult in figuring out exactly where I was going.  Two: Several items near the end of the game were not marked on the map.  However, these were written correctly in the written walkthrough, but the maps were incomplete near the end.<br />Overall, I would recommend this strategy guide to anyone who thinks they need it.  It offers help on where to go, what to do, and what you need at each point.

She is fiercely creative and a major talent.  Just as The Handmaid's Tale is a dark vision of a possible future, so is Oryx and Crake.  Oryx and Crake takes a future where genetic manipulation and genetic engineering is now the norm and the science of the future.  It is gleamed out of some realities of the present and stretched to a dystopian conclusion.  Even though I made a comparison to The Handmaid's Tale, that comparison will stop now because Oryx and Crake (as well as everything else that Atwood wrote) will come up short in comparison to that masterpiece.  Suffice it to say that Oryx and Crake isn't quite as good or as deep as The Handmaid's Tale, but that is an unfair comparison.  The only thing the two books have in common is that there is a dystopian vision of the future.<br />The narrator is a young man named Snowman.  He is essentially alone on a beach.  There is nobody else quite like him alive.  Snowman is an un-altered human.  There are other people, whom he calls Crakers, but they are images of perfection and genetically altered so much that there is little vestige of what we might imagine as being human.  Most the true humanity has been wiped off the planet and what is left is genetically altered humans/Crakers and altered wildlife/plant life.<br />The novel works in two ways.  One, we follow Snowman as he lives in the present (as far as the novel is concerned) and how he interacts with the Crakers.  We follow him on a journey as he travels across the land to get to where everything started.  Two, Snowman remembers the past and we are given glimpses into his life as a child, and as he grows up and how the catastrophe occurred.  It is in this way that we meet the title characters Oryx and Crake.  Crake was his childhood friend and also the architect of how the world turned out.  Oryx was the woman that Snowman fell in love with not long before humanity was destroyed.<br />This is a fast reading novel and it was very interesting to read.  It did not seem to have the social and emotional depth that I have come to expect from Margaret Atwood, but I did like the book.  Ultimately, Oryx and Crake will probably turn out to be a forgettable novel, but it was well done and was interesting enough to keep me reading./>This is a fast reading novel and it was very interesting to read.

After reading Winchester's book \\"The Professor and the Madman\\" I was very interested in reading some more of Simon Winchester's work.  The Map That Changed the World was the book that he wrote after The Professor.  It took me some time to get around to read it, but I was looking forward to it.  Winchester does a prodigious amount of research for his books and it shows as we learn about the stated subject of the book as well as all the details that surround it.<br />The Map That Changed the world deals with William Smith, an amateur geologist living at the end of the 18th Century.  William Smith had a driving ambition and interest in finding out exactly what was under the ground in England.  This may not seem like much, but the methods and knowledge that Smith acquired during his research and over decades of work were the building blocks for modern geology and for discovering everything we know about the geology of our planet.  William Smith is rightfully called the father of geology.<br />This book is filled with details of geology: rocks, strata, the ages of the earth, the Geological Society of London, etc.  On one hand, this is a very interesting work.  It tells the story of how one man pretty much established the ground rules for geology and what it can begin to know.  On the other hand, this book is so heavily detailed that it is dry reading.  I don't have a strong interest in geology, so I was interest in this book more for the historical implications rather than the geological ones (even though they overlap at times).  I think this book is worth reading for anyone interested in the social/scientific history of the time, and without reservation for anyone interested in geology.  This is a well written book.	2003-07-10

Long before he wrote the Hobbit or the Lord of the Rings, Tolkien was working on what would become the Silmarillion.  While Lord of the Rings is rightly his most popular work, it is only part of a larger world.  Tolkien created the whole of Middle Earth and we only got to see a little glimpse of it.  The Silmarillion can be treated as a history of Middle Earth.<br />Actually, that might be the best way to look at it.  It is not a single story and there does not seem to be any one thread or theme running through the course of the book.  Instead, we are given everything from the origins of Middle Earth right up to the events that led into Lord of the Rings.  If you think of the Silmarillion as a history book, you won't have any sort of unreasonable expectations going into it.  It is the history of a familiar world that never was.<br />I can't imagine that this would be a good starting place for someone looking to read Tolkien, but for fans (and only for fans) of Middle Earth, this is required reading to get a sense of the history of the land.  Like all of Tolkien's work, this is well written but it is also a little dryer than his other stuff.	2003-07-10

I never would have read this book if it was not for the movie that came out last year.  I still haven't seen the movie but decided that perhaps the book would be interesting since it was written by the subject of the movie.  I didn't learn until the end of the book (in a Q&amp;A section with the author) that this was written in 1980.  Abagnale has a very easy going style and it almost feels like he is right there next to you telling you this wild story of his youth.<br />Catch Me If You Can is an interesting, exciting, fast paced novel that is a pure joy to read.  I don't know if I can put it better than that.  This was a book that I simply did not want to put down and I flew through the book.  The plot of the memoir is the criminal career of Frank Abagnale (he has since paid his debt to society and now works to prevent exactly the sort of crime that he once committed).  Frank Abagnale was a con man.  He began his career at a young age (15) conning gas station attendants to give him cash when he pays with his father's credit card.  The leads to Frank leaving home, moving to New York City and trying to begin an honest life.  Unfortunately, Frank's one main vice is women, and to be with women he needs to have more money than a 16 year old high school dropout can earn.  So he begins to con.<br />Frank's primary method of conning was passing bad checks.  However, he found that it is easier to make the con if he is a member of a well respected profession.  Frank researches every role that he plays so that he will be as convincing as humanly possible without actually having to do that job.  In some cases, he was able to con so well that he was paid for it and he didn't have to forge checks.  The professions that Frank had impersonated were: Pilot, Doctor (he was paid to be on staff but not actually have to practice for nearly a year), Lawyer (he managed to pass the bar on his third try and worked as a laywer despite having no background in law), and a Professor (he taught two summer courses).  The reason everything worked so well was that Frank is an extremely smart man and nobody expected this sort of con.<br />As was expected (and as Frank expected), he was eventually caught (and escaped, and was caught again), and part of the book dealt with Frank's ride through the prison systems (France and Sweden play prominent roles).<br />I can't say enough good things about this book.  It was so interesting to read and I would recommend it to anybody.Professor (he taught two summer courses).

With the movie adaptation of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen coming out I figured now was a good time to become familiar with the source material and to get an understanding of who these characters are and how the whole comic works.  The comic/graphic novel (depends what you want to call it) is set in 1898,England.<br />Mina Murray (Bram Stoker's Dracula) is putting together a team made up of 19th Century literary heroes.  The team will comprise Alan Quartermain (King Solomon's Mines), The Invisible Man (title character), Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (title character), Captain Nemo (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea).  Other literary characters make appearances (the brother of Sherlock Holmes and somebody who may be a grandfather of James Bond...).  The goal of this team is to save London from all threats.<br />This first volume contains the first six issues of the graphic novel and is one complete story with a beginning, middle, and end.  It features the gathering of the League and the first enemy who is trying to destroy London.  The artwork is stunning and the book is well done.  This is a well told story, but my main problem was simply that I knew of the characters mostly by name and some by reputation.  The only characters that I was truly familiar with were the Invisible Man and Jekyll/Hyde.  This removed some of the charm of the book because it was not a romp with familiar characters but rather with familiar names.  I'll give this a positive review, but this isn't exactly my taste.	2003-07-08
US	52402330	R2KTMNJ3IHJTIF	0618127240	350597649	Dakota: A Spiritual Geography	Books	5	48	54	N	N	a beautiful, deliberate book of faith	Kathleen Norris is the author of Amazing Grace: A Vocabulary of Faith, and The Cloister Walk.  She is a poet.  Dakota was her first work of nonfiction/memoir.  Having read both Amazing Grace and The Cloister Walk, I had an idea of what to expect from Norris's work.  She writes deeply personal and deeply spiritual books.  Dakota has the same type of feel to it, but the location and the subject is different.<br />Kathleen Norris's past lay in western South Dakota, but for twenty years she had abandoned both her faith as well has her history.  She went to school in New York but decides to move back to Lemmon, SD with her husband.  Her book is subtitled \\"A Spiritual Geography\\".  She writes early on that geography comes from the words for earth and writing, and so knowing that this is a spiritual geography we immediately know that this is a spiritual discussion of the Dakotas, as well as also being about Norris herself.<br />Norris writes about small town life and small town church, and a semi-history of the town of Lemmon.  Since most of the details are told in anecdote, it makes things easier to read.  One thing that struck me was how she was comparing monastic life to small town faith and how much things tied together like that.  The focus on monastic life and on monks is a theme and a topic that will run throughout the book as well as into her subsequent books.  Kathleen Norris may not have a mainstream Christian faith, but she has a deep reverence and respect for the Christian tradition and faith, especially that which has come from the monasteries.<br />This is a slow moving, peaceful book.  It is thoughtful, intelligent, and moving.  It is filled to the brim with a steady faith in Christ and in some ways, it moves like time spent in a monastery.  I don't know if this sounds like a recommendation, but it is meant to be.  I found Dakota to be very interesting and along with Dakota, I would recommend Norris's later book: Amazing Grace.	2003-07-03
US	52402330	R2GWL7RBEYILZH	0345358805	109843857	King of the Murgos (The Malloreon, Book 2)	Books	4	9	9	N	N	a very whimsical fantasy series	Book 2 of the Mallorean<br />King of the Murgos continues Belgarion's quest to find his kidnapped son.  He is following someone named Zandramas but he is several months behind.  The search begins with Belgarion and a group of people named by Prophecy.  Belgarion's grandfather, the sorcerer Belgarath, mentions that while it may appear to be a roundabout way to go about the search, it is actually quicker to follow the instructions of prophecy.  In this way, Belgarion gains ground on Zandramas.<br />In King of the Murgos, the party (Belgarion, Belgarath, Polgara, Silk, Durnik, Toth, and CeNedra) journey in the quest to find Belgarion and CeNedra's son.  Oddly enough, they stop many times along the way and spend a good deal of time at each place.  In the odd way that the world of David Eddings works, this actually helps them gain time on Zandramas.  They learn some more of the reasons of why Zandramas kidnapped Geran and where she is going.  As they journey we are introduced to more characters (some of whom join Belgarion's quest).<br />I have seen comments to the effect that the Mallorean is essentially a rip off of the first series, the Belgariad.  In a sense, this is true.  We have most of the same characters and the quest feels similar.  Eddings actually addresses this in the book and it becomes inherent in the world of the Belgariad/Mallorean.  It is part of how the prophecy works.  On the other hand, the story is more mature than the first and some of the characters have matured (Belgarion, for one).  We have to remember that this is not high fantasy on the level of Tolkien or George Martin.  David Eddings writes a more light hearted and whimsical fantasy.  He has an entirely different touch and Eddings is just a lot of fun to read.  King of the Murgos is another entertaining entry in a very fun and familiar world.	2003-07-01

Good Faith is the new novel by Pulitzer Prize winning author Jane Smiley (A Thousand Acres).  Thus far, ever novel I have read by Jane Smiley (four) has been very good.  Good Faith is no exception.  Good Faith is set in the 1980's during an economic high point.  Joe Stratford is a realtor.  He is described on the book jacket as the type of guy that everyone likes.  He is friendly and good at his job.  Stratford spends a lot of time working on putting together a sale of one very big, expensive property.  At the same time, he is working with Marcus Burns, an ex-IRS agent who is always searching for a way to get rich quick and not have to pay taxes.  Stratford gets involved in a scheme that Burns cooks up about a huge land development deal.<br />Good Faith is really about two things: real estate and sex.  The real estate portion of the book has been mentioned.  The sex has not.  Stratford gets involved with an old friend, a married woman named Felicity.  Even as his real estate career is heating up, so is his relationship with Felicity.  She is a free spirit, though they are being very secretive about the relationship.  Breaking up the routine of the real estate portions of the book, we are given some of the most well-written sex scenes that I've come across.  They aren't lewd or overly graphic and while somewhat idealized they come across as very real.  I'm not sure that any author of Smiley's caliber writes sex scenes this good.<br />After reading Good Faith I am reminded why I enjoy reading Smiley's work.  She is a very good writer (Moo is probably my favorite of her books).  Good Faith may not be up to the standard of some of her other books, but it is well above the standard of most other authors.  Good Faith is worth checking out.  I found it very interesting all the way through (despite the fact that it is about real estate) and very well written.	2003-06-30

A novel of the Deryni.<br />I had thought, from the title and descriptions of the book, that this was going to be a sappy love story set in the Deryni universe as Kelson tries to woo a new bride to be his Queen.  As such, I put off reading King Kelson's Bride for several years.  The Deryni series has long been one of my favorites but I simply was not interested in a romance set in a fantasy world.  I finally decided to read the book, if only because I knew that Katherine Kurtz had a new Deryni series coming out this year and I wanted to be caught up in case it was set in Kelson's time.  King Kelson's Bride offered a pleasant surprise.<br />This was a different book than what I expected.  It turns out to be mostly a transition book (presuming that Kurtz does write another series after Kelson's era) to lay the groundwork for Kelson actually getting married and producing heirs as well as reconciliation between humans and Deryni.  Out of all of the Deryni books, my favorites are the ones that are set the farthest back in the history.  I prefer the ones dealing with Camber and his direct heirs (my favorite book is King Javan's Year).  Part of the reason was the prominence of Deryni in the society.  King Kelson's Bride is starting to rebuild the Deryni traditions in Gwynedd.  One of Kelson's big projects is to try to rebuild the Deryni training schools which had been eliminated during the Heirs of Saint Camber trilogy.  I love some of the ideas that are being put forth in King Kelson's Bride, but the execution of the novel itself was a little weak.<br />Kelson is marrying for Dynastic purposes and the woman that he loves is entering a religious order.  While the title of the book is focuses on the Bride, the book itself deals with the Bride more as an idea rather than with Araxie herself.  Araxie has the potential to be a strong woman in the series to the level of an Evaine, but we are given very little to work with.  Araxie is barely in the book, and while Kelson is portrayed as somewhat simpering over his lost love of Rothana, Araxie has strength and grace.<br />King Kelson's Bride is a stand alone novel in the Deryni series (though by its nature it is connected to the two Kelson trilogies) and is perhaps weaker because of that.  It feels like it only serves to present some ideas that may well appear in later Deryni trilogies.  This was an average Deryni novel, and all it did was whet my appetite for a real Deryni book to be released again.portrayed as somewhat simpering over his lost love of Rothana, Araxie has strength and grace.  <br />King Kelson's Bride is a stand alone novel in the Deryni series (though by its nature it is connected to the two Kelson trilogies) and is perhaps weaker because of that.

Harry is living with the Dursleys, his muggle (non-magical) aunt and uncle.  Harry is unhappy living there, but has no choice.  Underage wizards cannot use magic in the muggle world, so all Harry can do is send his owl to get messages from his friends Ron and Hermione as well as from his god-father Sirius Black.  As the summer winds to a close Harry gets permission to stay with the Weasley family.  Together, they go to the World Cup of Quidditch, which is being hosted by England.  The World Cup is the extent of Quidditch that we get for the book because of something else that is going on at the school.  The Tri-Wizard Championship has returned after a hiatus of centuries (because the fatality rate was far too high).  The Championship is between three magical schools and each school gets one champion.  Nobody under the age of 17 may enter and they will be magically prohibited to enter.  All names will be entered into the Goblet of Fire, which will select the champions.  Cedric Diggory (a Hufflepuff Quidditch player) is the Hogwarts champion.  The other two are selected and the selections should be over....until one more name is spit out: Harry Potter.  While this was against the rules, Dumbledore decided that since the Goblet of Fire spit out Harry's name, Harry must compete.<br />The book follows Harry during the school year as there are attempts on his life and through the Tri-Wizard Championship (made up of three trials spread out throughout the year).  There is quite a bit of action in this book and like the others, it is a book that once I started reading, I didn't want to stop.  There are surprises and sadness and everything in between.  J.K. Rowling writes so well that the characters are believable as people, and even though we know that magic isn't really, we can believe in it for the duration of the book.

Year 5<br />I picked up this book on Saturday morning and I did not want to put it down.  Like the previous four Harry Potter books, this is a book that once I started reading I had to keep at it until I finished the book.  I absolutely loved this book.  Rowling continues to impress me with each book and takes each book in a different direction than I had anticipated.  She surprises with what she puts into the books and surprises with who she may kill off.  By now many will have heard that a major character gets killed off in this book.  I'll just start off by stating that I will not spoil the surprise.  I'm not going to tell who is killed.<br />Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix starts out like the other four books: it is summer and Harry is living with his aunt and uncle at the house on Privet Drive.  Harry is now fifteen years old and is eagerly awaiting the day when he can return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  When book four had ended, the Dark Lord Voldemort had returned and come back to power.  The Wizarding world is divided on this.  Some believe Harry and Headmaster Dumbledore that Voldemort really has returned and that there is now a real threat.  Most do not.  They believe the reports in the Daily Prophet newspaper that claims that Dumbledore is slipping and Harry is lying.  The problem is that the only witnesses were Harry and Cedric Diggory (a fellow student).  Harry is being discredited and Cedric was murdered by Voldemort in book 4.<br />Harry is angry.  He is angry that Dumbledore sent him back to the Dursley's to live instead of with his friend Ron Weasley.  He is angry that nobody is permitted to tell him anything about what is going on during the summer, and he is angry that Dumbledore has pretty much forgotten all about him.  Every day Harry checks the newspapers (Daily Prophet and the muggle news) to try to get a whisper of an unexplained disappearance.  Nothing.  One day Harry is out walking in the park when he (and Dudley) are attacked by Dementors (the soul sucking guards of the Wizard Prison Azkaban).  Harry fights them off using magic, and this now sets off events that will reunite him with his friends and eventually return him to school...where everything has changed.<br />There is a semi-secret group called the Order of the Phoenix that is dedicated to fighting Voldemort at every opportunity.  Anywhere that Harry goes, a member is usually close by (even if Harry doesn't know about them).  Everything is different at school, though.  There is a new teacher for the Defense Against the Dark Arts: Professor Umbridge.  Umbridge was chosen by the Ministry of Magic (which officially does not believe that Voldemort has returned).  Umbridge is granted incredible power at Hogwarts by the Ministry and she changes absolutely everything.<br />This is an 870 page novel (in hardcover) and it begins rather slowly.  A lot of the adventure and action that is found in the other Harry Potter books is absent from the beginning of this book.  Instead, we are given what I call \\"institutional action\\".  There is a lot going on, but there isn't the adventure aspect.  The early plot deals with Harry on Privet Drive, with the Order, and what is going on at Hogwarts.  Luckily, this is very interesting and compelling.  The best stuff is at Hogwarts and deals with Professor Umbridge and the changes she is instigating at the school.  The fast paced action that we get in the other books is still here, but it comes a bit later in the book.  In no way is this a flaw.  There is a slightly different structure to the plot in this book, but Rowling pulls it off wonderfully.<br />As I mentioned earlier, this is a book that I just didn't want to put down.  26 hours after buying the book I was finished with it.  It reads quickly, just like the others.  The only complaint I have is that I'll have to wait several years until Miss Rowling publishes the next Harry Potter book.

Even as my team started to unravel after 1986 and 1988, Cone was stellar, leading the league in strikeouts and being the one constant quality player that the team had.  When he was traded out of New York I still tried to follow his career and was happy when he returned to New York, even as a Yankee.  It was with great disappointment that I read about his last season where he just fell apart and ended with a 4-14 record.  It was a sad ending to a great pitcher.<br />I wanted to read this book about David Cone.  The book was originally supposed to be about the craft of pitching, how a top level pitcher prepares and the mechanics of pitching.  That is the book that Roger Angell intended to write.  However, when Cone's mechanics broke down and his season fell apart, Angell stayed with him and realized that he had a completely different story.  This is the story of David Cone's last season with the Yankees and the collapse of a talented ballplayer.<br />Baseball is a game of digression.  Since the only action in the game takes place during frenzied bursts of motion between long periods of waiting, this gives the sportswriters and broadcasters time to talk about the game at hand as well as games and moments from years past.  This is a good thing to think about as you begin to read the book.  Roger Angell takes us through the 2000 season of David Cone.  He also provides a biography of Cone as well as moments from different parts of his pitching career.  This is just like a baseball game where everything is connected to history.  What is happening in May might recall David's rookie year, or his high school days.  This is how the book goes, from the 2000 season when Angell is spending time with Cone right to David's childhood and back again.  It may feel at times that there is very little organization, but I felt that it had part of the natural flow of watching (or listening to) a baseball game.<br />Some readers might be put off by the lack of chronology to the book and that it jumps around quite a bit.  It is a little distracting, but it wasn't bad at all in my mind.  It just felt like this is the way you tell the baseball story.

The novel opens at a birthday part for a Japanese business man, Mr. Hosokawa, who was wooed to that country for the chance to hear his favorite opera singer, Roxane Coss, sing for him.  This is a major event for this South American country, and the Vice President is there (the President declined so he could watch his daily soap opera) and is holding the event at his home.  Several other diplomatic officials, priests, and executives from Hosokawas company are there.  Most of the people at this party do not speak the same language.  When Coss finishes her last song, the lights go out.  When the lights come back on, the building has been taken over by terrorists.<br />This is only the opening of the novel.  This begins a stand off lasting several months between the terrorists and the government of the country.  But while the stand off provides the structure to the novel, the heart of it is inside that house.  The novel is truly about the relationships between the hostages and also the relationships with the terrorists.  Mr. Hosokawa does not go anywhere without his interpreter (he does a lot of international business), so Gen (the interpreter) was by his side at the party.  Gen becomes a major player in the house because he is the only one who can communicate between the Spanish speaking terrorists, the Swiss negotiator outside the house, and the hostages who speak various languages (French and Russian, are the two that I can remember).<br />As the novel progresses, Patchett reveals the disparate cast of characters and who they are and how they came to be at this party.  We see deeper into the lives of Hosokawa, Roxane Coss, the Vice President, the French Ambassador, and several others.  This makes for an incredibly rich novel and Patchett provides an emotional depth to the work that I had not expected.<br />I was initially reluctant to read Bel Canto.

The idea of a children's book by a professional wrestler, not to mention one known for the level of violence that Foley is, is a little surprising and I was more than a little bit skeptical.  Christmas Chaos is better than I expected.<br />Santa has been having some problems up at the North Pole.  The elves are showing no respect (one is running around naked and mooning Santa) and the reindeer are beating on Rudolph.  Everyone is filled with greed and Santa is in despair.  In the end he calls up Vince McMahon and a bunch of WWF superstars come and save the day.<br />While the action is crude, it never goes over the line of what may be appropriate for children.  Some parents may question the content, but in my experience (and the success of certain movies) this is what many children find funny, this sort of slapstick action.<br />One thing that must be mentioned is the inclusion of WWF superstars.  While this was done cleverly and was written well, it is also extremely dated and will only become more so as time goes on.  A truly good children's book will stand up over time, but I doubt this one will.  Children will not recognize the wrestlers and in another 5 years very few of them will be recognizable.  This hurts the ending portion of the book.  Since I recognized everyone, I enjoyed this children's book and thought it was fairly clever and well written.  I'm not sure what the reaction of children will be this year and in 5 years.	2003-06-13

King Trent wants Dor to gain experience in governing, so when the time comes that Trent must make a diplomatic trip to Mundania, he leaves Dor in charge for the week.  Dor does well enough for that first week, but when King Trent and Queen Iris do not return, there is cause for concern.  Dor wants to go directly to Mundania to find Trent, but the Council forbids it.  They do, however, agree to let Dor and some friends (Princess Irene, Grundy the Golem, Chet the Centaur and Smash the Ogre) travel to the south of Xanth to learn about the new Magician that recently appeared.<br />The first part of the book is the adventure through Xanth down to Centaur Isle.  I found this first half to be the least interesting part of the book.  It didn't appear to be much different that similar sections in the first three books, plus there didn't seem to be much progress.  It just seemed juvenile (even more so than usual).  Even though Dor is twice as old as he was in Castle Roogna, he acts the same.<br />Upon arrival at Centaur Isle, this book got interesting and I cared more about the story.  Aspects of centaur society were introduced and fleshed out, and the identity of the new Magician was revealed.  This also set up the trip to Mundania to rescue King Trent (if nobody saw that coming, I'll be very surprised).  Even though I found the first half of the book to be uninteresting, the quality of the second half more than makes up for it.  While I don't believe this is one of the best books of the series, it is redeemed by the ending of the novel.  Centaur Aisle is not great, and barely passes for good,  but it is a decent read in the Xanth series.	2003-06-13
US	52402330	R1SLDZWTT0NLIZ	0060521546	43532506	The Hardy Boyz: Exist 2 Inspire	Books	4	4	7	N	N	an interesting wrestling book	This autobiography of the Hardy Boyz is different from other wrestling autobiographies in that this one is of two wrestlers instead of just one.  Matt and Jeff Hardy are real life brothers and were a tag team in the WWE.  Since this is of two men, rather than one, the format of the narrative changed.  The best wrestling biographies (Mick Foley, Jerry Lawler) have gone into detail about the lives and careers of the wrestlers, but more so about the personal life.  The lesser but entertaining biographies (Bobby Heenan, Hulk Hogan) were more episodic.  There was no true narrative, but a series of short (one to two page) chapters dealing with a variety of subjects.  Exist 2 Inspire falls into the second category.  There is no true depth to the biography, but we are given the thoughts and opinions of the Hardys on various subjects and parts of their career.<br />Since the Hardy Boyz are brothers and the co-subjects of this book, the format is somewhat unique.  I believe the co-author (Michael Krugman) simply interviewed the brothers and organized their thoughts into separate sections.  The format is that Matt and Jeff each get to speak on a subject.  Sometimes it is back and forth between the two; sometimes it is just one paragraph by each brother.  Occasionally only one brother speaks.  It feels like actual conversation, which is a plus.<br />The book deals with topics covering most of their lives.  Considering that Jeff is only 25, that isn't a lot of time, but they have spent a decade in wrestling.  The parts that I found the most interesting was when they first started wrestling and they started their own promotion.  While it was never big enough to rival WWF or WCW (or even ECW), it was successful and always at least a little bit profitable.  I was very interested in reading about this time, as it showed the work ethic and desire of the Hardys and also that they worked at the very beginning with wrestlers who would end up in the WWE as well.  Shannon Moore (a Mattitude Follower) was a childhood friend of Jeff, and they also worked with Shane Helms (The Hurricane).  The other part that I really appreciated was when they were training in the WWF development center: Dory Funk Jr's Dojo.<br />This book did not seem to dig too deeply into the personal lives of the Hardys, but this was a very interesting and very entertaining book to read.  I would recommend it to any fan of professional wrestling.titude Follower) was a childhood friend of Jeff, and they also worked with Shane Helms (The Hurricane).

When I starting reading Mort, this all changed.  Having only read four Discworld books, Mort is by far the best of the first four books.<br />The focus of the Discworld series shifts to different characters in each book.  This time the focus is on a young man named Mort (hence the title).  Mort is an awkward young man with no interest in the family craft.  His father decides to hire Mort out as an apprentice.  So, Mort stands in the village square as all the other young men are chosen, but Mort is left standing.  He waits until midnight (the end of the choosing) and just as the bell tolls midnight, a rider appears.  Mort is chosen to be an apprentice.  Death himself takes Mort as an apprentice.  Death is a major recurring character throughout the series, and HE ALWAYS SPEAKS IN CAPITAL LETTERS.<br />Mort begins to learn the craft of the Reaper, but Mort manages to cause a major problem in reality when someone who is supposed to die does not die (Mort's fault, naturally).  This is the most interesting of the first 4 Discworld novels, and since the series doesn't appear to follow any sort of important chronology (for the most part), Mort may be one of the better books to begin the series with.  While I've been working my way through the series, I haven't had a lot of interest in each subsequent book....until now.  Mort has me interested in reading more Discworld novels.	2003-06-11

Ellis decided to take a look at six different issues and events of the first decades of the United States.  He did meticulous research on each of the issues and connected them to the larger context of American history, but the focus of each chapter was narrow enough so that we won't get lost in trying to figure out where everything fits in.  Ellis attempts to take the myths and legends away from these early leaders and put them into a human context and a historical context.  He succeeds at this.  One thing to note, however, Ellis has a very academic style to his writing.  While someone like David McCullough (also a Pulitzer Prize winner) weaves a story that flows and is fairly easy to read and move through, Ellis's academic prose makes for slower reading for comprehension.<br />The first chapter deals with the Hamilton-Burr duel.  All I knew about this was from the \\"Got Milk\\" commercial several years ago.  Ellis details the known facts about what happened and does some detective work to put together as best as possible what truly happened.  This was a very interesting chapter to start the book with and set the stage for how Ellis would construct his chapters.  He takes conflicting accounts (in this case, from the supporters of Burr and Hamilton) and weaves them together taking all the evidence in account and tries to make the story fit.<br />Other chapters deal with The Friendship of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, George Washington's Farewell Address, the rumor of a dinner which settled where the new Capitol would located, the Silence on the issue of slavery, and the collaborations of the Founders.  This is a very interesting period in American History, and a vitally important one.<br />I learned quite a bit about different parts of early American history and this book will serve as a jumping off point to get into other historical works so that I'll have a more expanded background for some of the subjects that will surely come up.erve as a jumping off point to get into other historical works so that I'll have a more expanded background for some of the subjects that will surely come up.	2003-06-09

The subject did not sound like something that I would be interested in.  But then I read The Briar King a couple of months ago and realized that Greg Keyes is an author I would like to read more of.  So I picked this book up again and finally started reading.  It was a whole lot better than I expected.<br />The story begins with Isaac Newton discovering a substance (called Philospher's Mercury, I believe).  While Newton was a great scientist, he unsuccessfully dabbled in alchemy.  The prologue takes a \\"what if\\" approach to Newton and his alchemy.  In this book, Isaac Newton is ultimately successful and it is this new substance that changed the course of history.  This aether allows for the creation of devices that could exist today (even though it is during the time of Benjamin Franklin) as well as some that have never existed.  There is a cannon mentioned (not the one in the title) that when the cannonball strikes a castle, it turns the walls to glass and then shatters the castle.  This aether (Philosopher's Mercury) is the most influential discovery in human history and it has changed the nature of the 1700's.<br />Flash forward several decades.  Our hero is Benjamin Franklin (yes, that Benjamin Franklin).  He is 14 years old and every bit the genius that history has told us.  He is an apprentice to his brother, a printer.  With some of Franklin's theories and inventions on how to adapt some of the existing technology even further, his life is threatened.  We see how Franklin begins to work some things out and how he ends up chased out of Boston to London.<br />At the same time, there is intrigue going on in the court of Louis XIV in France.  France is in the middle of a war with England (and is on the losing end), but they are developing a super weapon that could potentially destroy all of London.  The main character in these sections is not Louis, as one might expect, but rather a young woman named Adrienne.  Adrienne secretly studies mathematics in a place where women are not treasured for their learning, but she is thrust onto a path filled with secrets but also the opportunity to learn more.<br />Starting with an interesting concept (though not one that initially attracted me to the book), and executed very well and believably, Greg Keyes has written a very good first book (out of 4 for this series).  While I did not find it as stunning as The Briar King, I remain interested enough in this series that I intend on reading book 2 (A Calculus of Angels).uis, as one might expect, but rather a young woman named Adrienne.

When I heard what the subject matter was for his new book (pot, porn, and illegal labor) I wasn't that interested but I wanted to find out what Schlosser had to say.  In the introduction, Schlosser writes that the book is made up of three essays that are mostly unrelated, but these essays were tied together with the idea of the American Underground Economy which pervades the book.  Reefer Madness is Schlosser's attempt to show how large the underground economy (meaning, non-taxed and illegal money) is in America.  Schlosser discusses the laws and the social conditions that have allowed these things to occur.<br />The first essay is on Marijuana.  Apparently, marijuana is America's number one cash crop, but it is illegal to buy, sell, grow, or possess any amount of marijuana in America.  Schlosser gives the history of marijuana legislation and reveals the severity of the punishments regarding marijuana violations (even compared to murder).  This essay looks at the applications of marijuana laws throughout United States history.  It highlights some of the absurdly harsh penalties given for first time convictions of even trace amounts of pot; this essay also shows the disparity in verdicts for the children of politicians compared to the poor.  There are comparisons with the drug laws of other nations and a discussion on the health risks and health concerns regarding marijuana.  Very interesting essay.<br />The second essay deals with illegal labor in California.  Specifically, the essay is on the illegal labor in the strawberry industry.  This is the shortest essay of the three, but it does a good job in explaining the rise of migrant labor since the 1970's and why farm companies would use this labor.  Surprisingly, most of America's strawberries are grown in California and at least half of the labor provided is illegal.  The conditions that these workers (from Mexico) live in is horrible and the labor itself is one of the most physically demanding work that one can do on a farm.  Illegal labor is becoming a larger and larger sector of some industries as these men (mostly) will work for significantly lower wages just so that they can have work.  This essay had more of a human story to it and was more emotionally involving than the Marijuana essay.  However, this essay didn't seem to have the societal import that the discussion on marijuana law did.<br />The third essay focuses on pornography.  Schlosser does not touch on the morality side of the pornography issue, but instead deals with the economics of porn.  Like the other two essays, this one details the history of pornography in America and happens to be the longest of the three essays.  Pornography is big business and the U.S. government has been cracking down on the industry on an off for years.  For many years, the leading figure in the industry was one man, Reuben Sturman.  The legality of porn is constantly in question and at the base are the very hazy obscenity laws.  Much of this essay is about Sturman, his rise to lead the industry and the attempt to convict Sturman.<br />Any one of these essays could easily become a full length book and would be very interesting individually.  Taken together, the tie that binds them is not very strong and the transition between the essays feels a little jumpy.  This is an extremely interesting book and one that I am very glad that I read.  Individually, these are excellent essays, but when taken together, they lose some of the narrative force that Schlosser excels at.  This is worth reading, without question.from Mexico) live in is horrible and the labor itself is one of the most physically demanding work that one can do on a farm.

The first was the Belgariad, which introduced us to Garion, Belgarath, Polgara, and the world of Kings, Gods and Men.  Guardians of the West picks up several years after the end of Enchanter's End Game.  Garion, the young farmboy from Sendaria is now King Belgarion of Riva.  He is trying to rule his island nation wisely.  One day he is woken during the night by the voice of the Prophecy.  He is told to \\"Beware Zandramas!\\"  Nobody knows who or what this Zandramas is, only that it is dangerous.  Garion had thought that his adventures had come to an end when he slew the evil god Torak.  The more research Garion and his family does into this Zandramas, the more it appears that it is all beginning again.<br />As the book progresses there are attempts on the lives of his wife and others in the Rivan government.  It is clear that there is a larger conspiracy which initially implicates friends and allies of Garion, but the true evil behind this has not come out into the open.  This first book of the series is rather slow moving, which is fine for a fan of the series, but might be somewhat off-putting for those who are reading this book for the first time.  Eddings spends a lot of time introducing what will be the overall conflict of this series.<br />Reading David Eddings was what first got me interested in the fantasy genre.  The Mallorean does not have the same feel of the Belgariad, the characters have grown up a bit more, but it is an enjoyable trip through a familiar world.  The fantasy of David Eddings is a bit simplistic, but that is also part of the joy of reading this author.  It is a pleasure to read...just make sure that you've read the Belgariad first, though.	2003-05-29

Just about all Ive read for that age group is Harry Potter, but Ive seen enough positive and glowing reviews for this book that I figured I should take a look at it.  My initial impression is that it is quality work, but it lacks something that would make it truly special.<br />The Thief Lord is mainly the story of Bo and Prosper, two boys who have run away from their aunts home (their parents are no longer alive) to Venice, Italy.  They meet up with some other street kids and get taken in by a 13 year old named Scipio.  Scipio goes under the name The Thief Lord.  They live in an abandoned movie theater and Scipio steals to provide for the children.  The aunt of Bo and Prosper hires a local detective to find Bo (she doesnt want to take back Prosper.  Bo is the younger of the two and she feels that Prosper is a bad influence on his brother).  While the children are living in the theater and planning for a big robbery that will pretty much allow for them to live very comfortably, Victor the Detective is looking for them and recognizes Prosper one day on the street.  Now he has an idea on how to look for the children, and the kids are alerted to fact that Victor is looking for Bo and Prosper and is getting closer.  Scipio, the child benefactor also has his own secrets that he wants to keep hidden.<br />This is a well written book, but it isnt as engaging as I would have hoped for.  I was interested in what happens next, but I was never really absorbed into the story.  Ill give it a positive review, with some reservations.	2003-05-28

I had seen the movie when it came out in the theater, but otherwise this is not a genre that normally interests me.  I decided that I wanted to read the book anyway.<br />While the book and the movie started the same, it became quickly apparent that the movie deviated quite a bit from Ludlum's novel.  The novel opens with two newspaper clippings about an assassin named Carlos.  It moves right into Bourne being shot and falling into the ocean.  He is pulled from the water and is put into the care of a doctor.  The doctor heals Bourne, but Bourne does not remember his past.  He does not know his name or how he came to be where he is.  All he has is an account number for a bank in Zurich.  It is with this knowledge (and the lack thereof) that Jason Bourne begins his quest to unravel his identity.  Bourne's actions are determined by the little information that he has, but he quickly learns that someone is trying to find him and kill him.  He finds out the name of a company that he thinks he works for, Treadstone 71.  But when I tried to contact this company, it doesn't exist...as near as he can tell.  However, the closer he comes to finding who he is and why he has all these skills (fighting, espionage) and memories that he can't explain; the closer he is to being killed.<br />Starting from the simple concept of one man trying to find out who he is, this book travels up the ranks of the U.S. Government to covert ops from the CIA.  The book also has the other side hunting Bourne: the organization of an assassin named Carlos (the Jackal).  This was an extremely engrossing novel and is far superior to the recent movie adaptation.	2003-05-27

With each novel, Feist has broadened his world and shown more and more of the lands that make up Midkemia.  This novel begins in the Eastern Kingdoms, to the far east (and somewhat to the north) of the Kingdom of the Isles.  We also see the Kingdom of Roldem and get to revisit the Sorcerer's Isle.<br />Kieli is a boy about to become a man on Midsummer's Day.  His people, the Orosini, get their adult names by going on a vision quest high up a mountain.  Just as Kieli gets his adult name, Talon of the Silver Hawk, he sees smoke coming from his village.  Hurrying home, he finds his village in flames and most of his people slaughtered.  He tries to fight, but is severely wounded and left for dead.  He is found and rescued by Robert de Lysis and a couple of other men.  Talon awakes at Kendrick's, a tavern/small fortress.  Because Robert saved his life, Talon owes him a life-debt and begins to serve under Robert.  Robert, Caleb (a hunter), and Magnus (a sorcerer) train Talon but do not yet tell him to what end.  Talon thinks only of revenge on the men who slaughtered his people.  Talon is now the last of the Orosini.<br />For most of the first part of the book, Talon's benefactors remain a mystery.  Who are these men?  Who do they work for?  We get hints of Magnus's and Caleb's parentage.  The book does not directly tell when the novel is taking place, but we get hints from some things.  Rupert Avery had commissioned a book before he died.  Grandsons of Duke James are mentioned.  We do get to revisit some of the characters with abnormally long lifespans (Nakor, Pug, Miranda).<br />The second half of the book takes place in Roldem, a kingdom mentioned several times throughout the Riftwar novels.  Talon is in a tournament to become to the world's greatest swordsman.<br />I enjoyed this book, and Midkemia is one of my favorite fantasy worlds, but Feist didn't really build the locations very well in this novel.  Kendrick's was well done, but the rest of it (Sorcerer's Isle, Roldem) were merely place names instead of actual locations that I could picture.  Also, despite the horrible things that had happened to Talon, I never really grew to care for him as I did for Pug, Tomas, Arutha, and Jimmy.  I am curious to see how Talon grows into his new role with the mysterious group, The Conclave of Shadows, but I haven't grown as attached to Talon as I did with other characters.

Since this came out around the same time as Anthony Swofford's Jarhead, there will likely be some comparisons.  There shouldn't be.  Baghdad Express is much better.  On a very basic level, Turnipseed is a better writer than Swofford is.  Baghdad Express is well constructed and follows from beginning to end the tour of duty in Desert Storm.<br />Joel Turnipseed is a different kind of a soldier.  More of an intellectual than the prototypical warrior, he would much rather be in a coffeehouse discussing philosophy than in a military caravan.  However, Joel Turnipseed is a Marine.  He wanted out of the Corps, but never left and now he was called up and activated.  When we learn that Turnipseed brings volumes and volumes of philosophy with him to war, we know that we are in for a different kind of war story.<br />Turnipseed was a driver for the Baghdad Express.  The Baghdad Express was the largest supply line in recorded war.  He would drive up to 600 miles a day in round trips bringind supplies and material to the front lines where the fighting and flying is going on.  So while he wasn't a front line fighting soldier, he had a vital role in the first Gulf War.  He relates his experiences in the war.  Partially an outcast because of his philosophy, he was also included in a group called the Dog Pound.  The Dog Pound was mostly African-American soldiers (Turnipseed is white) who loved to talk.  Community was build through trading insults and fast moving conversation.  Turnipseed's ability to adapt to this and his inclusion into the group (even spouting philosophy and have it listened to) was probably vital to his experience.  However, as the war ends and the Minnesota group came back, Turnipseed finds himself slipping out of the Dog Pound that was his home for the duration of the war.<br />This was a very different look at a war because of who Joel Turnipseed is.  He writes as a disclaimer that this is a memoir of memory and not of journalism so any mistakes is from what he remembers and perhaps not as everything actually happened....and this is a very honest admission.  This is his story as he remembers it.

After 50 pages I remembered what I needed to and the context filled me in on the rest and the story started to really get going.<br />I've noticed complaints about the actions of some characters.  The only one who I think acted out of character was Chloe.  Her actions at the beginning of the book were both stupid, and I think a little out of character.  It served the plot, though, so we can gloss over it.  There were some surprises in character action near the end, but these were explained well enough that I don't feel as if they were misplaced.<br />The usual complaints about the series apply to this book.  The quality of writing is not that great, I still have problems with naming one of the primary characters \\"Buck\\", and much of the books seem to be heavy handed.  However, when I'm reading the book I forget all about that and I can't put it down.  There is something incredibly compelling about the Left Behind series.  Maybe it is seeing God take such a prominent role in a popular novel.  Maybe it is just how quickly and easily the series reads, but there is something about it that makes me want to keep reading and gets me involved in the story.  Maybe it is God working through these books, if such a thing is possible.<br />The story begins late in the Tribulation.  A plague of darkness and pain is on the city of New Babylon, the capitol of the Anti-Christ, Nicolae Carpathia.  There are questions of whether or not the Safe House is still safe and Chloe Steele-Williams gets captured by the GC (Global Community) troops.  Believers must get out of New Babylon as God's further judgment is coming.  As the book progresses, the story jumps several months and the final judgments from Revelation are unleashed.  More than one major character is killed in this book, so there is some shakeup going on in the cast of characters.  Which ones and in what way I will leave for the reader to find out.<br />I am not blind to the flaws and faults of this series, but as I read the books, the flaws and faults simply do not matter.  I won't pretend that these should win awards for the craft of writing, though.  I think that one reason why the Left Behind books are so compelling (this one included) is that we get to see one possible interpretation of how the Book of Revelation may play out.  I am a Christian, so I do believe that Revelation is true, but I don't claim to have any interpretation of it myself nor do I believe that this is necessarily the correct interpretation.  It does help in imagining the End Times, though.  The next book is to be the last book, and I am curious as to how Jenkins will write the second coming of Christ (LaHaye is the theologian, Jenkins the author).nd the final judgments from Revelation are unleashed.

US	52402330	R1C3SB1SJRPW0F	0060504072	560632836	Small Wonder: Essays	Books	4	15	15	N	N	Not brilliant, but worth reading	For all the outcry about Barbara Kingsolver's anti-American, anti-war stance in this book, I was expecting some sort of long winded, rant of a diatribe against U.S. policy in the wake of September 11, 2001.  That is what I was expecting.  That is what some readers of the book had claimed, that it was ultra-left wing, too preachy, too mired in politics, and riddled with hypocrisy.<br />I disagree.  I thought that this was a well written and interesting collection of essays.  Also, the collection was not the amount of politicized essays that I had expected and was led to believe.  Most of the essays reflect Kingsolver's ecological interests and themes that we see in her novels (most notably in Prodigal Summer).  While some essays skirt around the reality of September 11, most deal with the day to day living that Kingsolver experiences and how she tries to live her life in the most environmentally friendly way possible.  She writes about independent booksellers are going out of business and how her first novel \\"The Bean Trees\\" was heavily pushed through independent stores and this is how the word of mouth spread.  And yes, Barbara Kingsolver does write about September 11.  She refuses to accept that the attack was at all justified but does acknowledge that there was an explanation for how the hatred for the United States has probably come in part from our foreign policy.  To me, this does not seem like it such a radical opinion.  While she does spend a little bit of time (one or two essays, really) on some of the political aspects of 9/11, the other times she addresses the subject is in the impact that it has had in her life and her family, and in communities.  She grounds most of her writing in the commonplace that is the focus of her fiction.<br />I don't agree with everything that Kingsolver believes in and writes about, but she is eloquent in her essays and I am glad to have read them.  As she provides an alternate viewpoint to that which is normally presented in the media/society/government today, it is even more important read such dissident voices.  Disagree as we may on a given subject, one of the most important freedoms in America is the right to speak against what one believes is wrong.  Barbara Kingsolver is a small voice, but a well spoken one.  We should at least listen before dismissing out of hand.in the media/society/government today, it is even more important read such dissident voices.

While noting the time period helps give depth to the historical backdrop of when Thomas was writing this book, it is perhaps more important to know the audience.  The intended audience for The Imitation of Christ was monks.  This is obvious in the text and it should be kept in mind while reading this work.<br />This highly influential work has a very simple message: live like Christ.  Presented in this book, it is a very strict message.  Thomas takes a very strict interpretation of following Christ and the message is very much rooted in the idea of works.  It is the actions that one must perform, and not so much the inner state (though he does stress that the inner state is important).  This would be a difficult message to take or to give, but again, we must consider the audience: monks living in a monastery.  They must live a harsher life and because of their vows, this devotional makes perfect sense.<br />This can be read as a historical document in Christianity or as a devotional.  Either way, one can find great value and and some illumination of the words of Christ through this volume.	2003-05-12

Since I have read that book, nothing has come close to being nearly as good or as honest.  I was skeptical about reading Jerry Lawlers autobiography because all I knew of him was the joke he has become as a WWF/E announcer.  I was aware that he was a legend in Memphis wrestling and that he had the famous angle with Andy Kaufman (I learned about this from the film Man on the Moon).  That was all I knew of Jerry Lawler.  I decided to read the book anyway and Im glad that I did.  While Mick Foley is a more sympathetic person and it is easier to care for Foley, Jerry Lawler has written (with a co-writer) one of the best wrestling biographies on the market.<br />Even though the narrative jumps around a little bit, this is a straightforward and mostly chronological account of Jerry The King Lawlers life and career in professional wrestling.  We are introduced to a young Jerry Lawler going to local wrestling events with his father, but having no interest in being a wrestler himself.  It was only through his art (he originally wanted to be an artist) that he even had any contact with the world of professional wrestling and the men outside the ring.  It was only later, as a radio DJ that Lawler ended up with the exposure and interest to try to be a professional wrestler.  Since then, Lawler has led a charmed career in the ring.  We learn about the scope of his career in Memphis and finally his entry into the WWF (later WWE).<br />If Lawlers professional life has been charmed, his personal life has not been.  While Jerry Lawler reveals that he has never drank alcohol or done any drugs, he does admit that his one vice has always been women and sex.  Lawler freely admits that he has been a horrible husband and father and that he has not been able to stay faithful to his wives.  The pattern has been that near the end of a marriage, Lawler meets a very young woman (early 20s) and ends up leaving his wife for the other woman.  The only exception to this is his last wife, Stacy Carter.  Stacy (former WWF Diva, the Kat) married Lawler when she was 19 and she ended up leaving him.  Lawler has continued his interest in young women.  Lawler makes no excuses for his lifestyle and he does not attempt to wallow in pity (nor does he try to incite others to pity him).<br />This is a very honest book and revealing of many aspects of the culture of professional wrestling.  Jerry Lawler does throw in a bit too many jokes and references that one would expect from Jerry Lawler the announcer, but as a whole, this is one of the best wrestling biographies that I have read.  In terms of quality, I would place this one second behind Foleys first autobiography.e end of a marriage, Lawler meets a very young woman (early 20s) and ends up leaving his wife for the other woman.

Fans had been clamoring for her to tell her life's story, but she's been too busy writing her novels.  Her second son, Todd, wrote this book to give the fans a little bit of what they want.  That's the problem.  It is a little bit.  This is a very slim volume (coming in at not much more than 100 pages) and is not very well organized.  We are not really treated to the entirety of McCaffrey's life and this is not a chronological book.  Todd McCaffrey jumps around quite a bit and never stays on any one subject for too long.  We get glimpses of the science fiction legend.  We see a little bit of her early life and the problems she had growing up.  We see her as a struggle writer, and a struggling singer/actor.  We see how these experiences shaped her later novels (the singer problems translated directly into Crystal Singer), but we never really get a sense of who Anne McCaffrey is.  Granted, I'm not expecting the depth of research that we would get from Robert Caro or David McCullough, but this is a very skimpy biography and is somewhat of a let down.  Decent enough for fans of McCaffrey, but I can't imagine this would be of interest to anybody else.	2003-05-06

In this volume Roy continues to take on India's Big Dam project (a subject in  her previous two volumes of essays), as well as violence world wide.  She does not spare her native India anything and takes on the War Against Terror and the hypocrisy of U.S. foreign policy.  It is always a pleasure to ready Roy's work.  She gives out a viewpoint of a citizen from another country and brings a new voice to the table.  She condemns how Americans are presented information and understands that it is difficult to get truly factual from the press (any press).  She also praises Noam Chomsky for his work in revealing some of the lies that are fed to Americans by the United States government.  I am not informed enough to know anything about the accuracy of her statements regarding U.S. policy, but Roy has a viewpoint that should be considered.  I feel that the biggest value in Roy's essays comes in revealing information about Indian politics and Indian life.  I know very little about India, and Roy is a valuable source of information and makes me want to learn more about this ancient (yet young) nation.	2003-05-06

I finally finished this massive 1026 page hardcover novel.  Ignoring the page count for a moment, this is a very large book with lots of things going on.  Tom Clancy is following multiple plot-lines and eventually weaving them all together in the attempt to build not just a story, but the broad overview of his world.  Over the course of the past 8 novels, Tom Clancy has built a world that is similar to our own, but different events have changed the political reality inside the United States.  When The Hunt for Red October was published, Jack Ryan was new to the CIA as an analyst.  As the series has moved on, Ryan has moved up the CIA hierarchy and was eventually the Deputy Director of the CIA and took the place of his mentor, James Greer.  Terrorists have exploded a nuclear bomb at the Super Bowl in Denver (The Sum of All Fears), a war was instigated that caused a terrorist to crash a plane into the capitol killing the President, most of Congress and all of the Supreme Court (Debt of Honor).  At the time that happened, Jack Ryan was just sworn into being the Vice President (he was going to accept the post for the year until election time and then retire from government service all together), so he was now the President.  After winning one more war in the Middle East, Jack Ryan actually ran for President and won.  This is where The Bear and the Dragon begins.  Ryan is now President in his own right and is a year into his term.<br />That was a long introduction to a long novel, but it is important to know because this shapes the actions and thoughts of the characters in Clancy's world.  China was behind two major operations: the recent war with Japan (Debt of Honor) and the war with the new Islamic nation that consisted of Iraq and Iran (Executive Orders).  CIA believed that China was behind all this, but did not have the proof.  So, by this point the top ranked government officials are very skeptical of China and the Chinese.  Some reviewers have cried racism, and while the Chinese are painted in a VERY unfavorable light and racist remarks are used by the government officials, we are dealing with a very different world than the one that we live in.  China instigated major wars and chemical warfare against the United States.  We must take the previous books into account when reading this one.<br />The Bear and the Dragon deals with several plots.  The United States has a spy in China and he is working to get access to high level Politburo information.  This involves the recruitment of an agent within China, a secretary to a Politburo member.  Another plotline involves the discovery a massive oilfield in Russia (larger than the Middle East), as well as a huge gold mine in Russia.  This naturally gets China interested in moving north into Siberia.  The novel begins with an attempt on the life of Golovko, the top advisor to the President of Russia (I can't remember his exact title, but he used to run the KGB and has appeared in past novels).  We see John Clark, Domingo Chavez, and other repeat characters from previous books.<br />As I said, the book is long, and in several parts it drags a bit.  For a novel this large and with a plot this convoluted and detailed, it is an interesting read.  Not quite up to the level of Clancy's best, it also isn't as bad as some reviewers might have you believe.  There is some parts of the book that aren't as interesting and the characters are more or less one dimensional now (Clancy spent 8 books developing some of these characters, I think we're okay if he doesn't change them in book 9).  Some parts feel rushed (the ending) and some parts smack of Clancy himself being too much in the novel, but honestly, this is a Tom Clancy novel and we aren't reading this with the expectation that it be William Faulkner.  Clancy does best with the military parts of the book, and to be perfectly honest: this was an enjoyable book to read and is a worthy member of the Jack Ryan Universe.and while the Chinese are painted in a VERY unfavorable light and racist remarks are used by the government officials, we are dealing with a very different world than the one that we live in.

Her first two novels (Rainlight, Shadow Baby) were quite exceptional and quickly made McGhee one of my favorite authors.  Was It Beautiful? fully deserves to be mentioned with McGhees other novels.  It is just as good.  The title of the books asks the question: Was It Beautiful?  While this is really a question for the protagonist, William T, I believe that the question also fits the novel itself.  To answer the question, yes, it was a beautiful novel.  Very.<br />McGhee revisits the Sterns community in the Adirondacks Mountains.  We get to see Crystal and Johnny (Rainlight, Shadow Baby) and see a glimpse of Clara and Tamar Winter (Shadow Baby).  With these characters appearing, it is easy for McGhee to build the very strong sense of place that we get with Sterns.  Some of the locales are back.  Crystals diner plays a strong role in this novel, and readers of McGhees work are immediately familiar with this world.  This time around, we get the story of William T Jones.  Everyone calls him William T.  William Ts life used to be pretty good.  He had a loving wife, a son, and a job he was proud of.  Unfortunately, he didnt get the life he thought he had.  His son was hit by a train and died.  His wife left him.  His job, while he was still proud of it, wasnt as special as it was when his life was still beautiful.<br />This is how we begin the novel, with a 50 year old man dealing with the grief over his life and his losses.  In the hands of a lesser writer, this could be the start for cheap melodrama.  In the sure hands of Alison McGhee, we are given a compassionate story about a broken man and how his friends can help begin his healing.  We do not have to wonder about the title and if it was beautiful.  With a novel by Alison McGhee, we know that it is.	2003-04-28

I was even more surprised to find myself watching the show regularly.  We record the show in the afternoon and watch it later in the evening.  One of my first problems was that I didn't know who anybody was and I really didn't know how these people related to each other, and what their stories were.  After watching the program for a month or two now, I know who the characters are, and I have a better idea of how they relate to each other as some of the back story has been revealed on the show.  However, there is quite a bit that I don't know.  My girlfriend told me to read this book.<br />Purportedly, this book is written by Tabitha Lenox, a character on the show who happens to be a witch (and has been alive for hundreds of years, if not more).  Apparently, she was trying to sell the book to other characters on the show.  The format of the book is a series of short chapters dealing with incidents from the past involving characters on the show.  To put it simply, this book contains a lot of the back story for Passions.  We see why Tabitha hates Grace's family, we see the origins of the relationship between Eve and Julian and why T.C. hates Julian.  We get to see the relationship between Sam and Ivy, and how Ivy married Julian.  We see Sam first meet Grace.  Mixed between the stories of the characters on the show, this book also reveals some of the history of Harmony (Tabitha is involved in quite a bit of it).  There are glimpses of the revolutionary war (with the past lives of Sheridan, Luis, and Miguel), and also of the ancestors of the Standish family (Grace's family).<br />For someone who is still fairly new to the show, this book was both interesting as well as valuable in informing me of the history of Harmony and the histories of the characters.  Since the book was written in 2001, there are several characters that get no mention (Beth and Liz are the two most prominent ones).  However, if you are interested in knowing how things got to be the way they are on the show, this book will help a lot.two most prominent ones).

With the second Gulf War coming to a close (presumably), this is a popular time to be reading books about the first Gulf War as they may have some bearing on the current one and to help us understand what might really be happening on the ground.  Jarhead is a memoir of the first Gulf War written by Anthony Swofford, a marine sniper who was in Kuwait and Iraq for Operation Desert Shield/Storm.  This is his story of the Marines, and his experiences in the first Gulf War.<br />Swofford tells a story of one mans disillusionment with the Marine Corp and while he tries to spin the story so that we believe this is the entire Corps; that is a hard story to take.  Swoffords Marine Corps is a bunch of men who do not want to be there and would love nothing more than to go home again.  I have no reason to doubt the veracity of Swoffords experiences, but the author also admits to being a little unstable throughout his tour of duty.  It is Swoffords depression (which he mentions several times) and disillusionment with the military and war that shapes and colors his narrative.  As he weaves his story, the author presents his view of war.  By the end of the book, Swofford is telling us that war is wrong and unnecessary.<br />I thought this was a well written (if profane) book about the first Gulf War (and war in general), however Anthony Swoffords views on that particular war (that it was fought for oil) colors his account.  He presents the idea that war is bad, but does not acknowledge the necessity of it at times, nor does Swofford present a reasonable alternative to war.  Even so, Jarhead is well worth reading.	2003-04-21

When I went to play again, I realized that I didn't remember the story that well and I didn't remember the layout of the area I was in.  I decided to restart the game, but this time use a guide to make sure that I don't miss any items and to quickly get through the areas I had already played.  Since this was the only guide available, I picked it up.<br />Some reviews of this guide make mention that the guide is not actually needed to complete the game and that simply playing the game is all the strategy that one needs.  That may very well be, but I don't think that applies in reviewing the guide.  What matters is that the guide has all of the necessary information required to complete the game and not miss any items and that it includes tips on how to beat the bosses.  This guide has all of that and is very valuable in completing the game.  While many things can be discovered by trial and errors, this guide will get you through the game with no trouble (the only trouble may come in actually applying the strategies to beat a boss).  The most valuable aspect of this guide comes in that it details on a map the patrol patterns of the guards.  Knowing in advance how far a guard will patrol is very useful in planning your path though the level.  If capturing the dog tags from the soldiers is important to you (and if you want the bonus items, it should be important), the guide provides useful strategies on how to get every dog tag in the game (on normal mode).  I tried out some of them, and it worked just as the guide suggested.  I wasn't that interested in collecting the dog tags my first time completing the game, so I didn't spend the time to collect them all.  As far as I could tell, the strategies were spot on.<br />One thing I should mention is that the strategies to get the dog tags and for beating the game apply to the normal difficulty setting.  Since some things change on the higher difficulty levels, the guide is probably not as useful for mastering the game on the highest difficulty.<br />Using this guide for the normal difficulty level, this is an excellent guide that will take you through the game and not spoil and story points.  If you feel you need a guide for Metal Gear Solid 2, this one is well worth your money.e higher difficulty levels, the guide is probably not as useful for mastering the game on the highest difficulty.  <br />Using this guide for the normal difficulty level, this is an excellent guide that will take you through the game and not spoil and story points.

Piers Anthony is best known for his Xanth series, but I enjoyed the first three novels of this series as much as I did anything else that Piers Anthony wrote.  The novel (and series) deals with a dual world.  Proton is a science fiction orientated world.  The laws of science rule the world.  The planet is desolate with the air being unbreatheable.  People live in large city sized domes.  People are divided into two classes.  Citizens are extremely wealthy, are permitted to wear clothing, and are the rulers of Proton.  Serfs do the work, are not permitted clothing (though are permitted their own diversions as long as it does not interfere with their work), and have a limited tenure on Proton.  After their tenure expires, they must leave the planet (though they do get to collect a large amount of their earnings at the end of tenure).  Phaze is a fantasy world where magic exists and the world is still fairly pristine.  The powers of Phaze are human magician called Adepts (they are adept in one particular facet of the magic).  Dragons, unicorns, and werewolves are real.  The features of the Phaze are the same as Proton, except the land hasn't been ruined.<br />The protagonist of the novel is a man named Stile.  Stile is a serf on Proton.  He is a jockey for a Citizen, but in the private world of the serfs, he is a master at the Games.  The Games are the main entertainment for serfs, and they get to test their skills at various sports/games/arts/activities.  A master player can excel in most facets of the Game.  Stile is a master player and is two years from the end of his tenure.  He meets a female robot named Sheen (get the pun?).

US	52402330	R300GARNZ24AHV	0743244249	195828381	Cosmopolis: A Novel	Books	3	11	13	N	N	could have been so much better	After a year passed since I read The Body Artist, I started anticipating what Don DeLillo would write next.  While I found The Body Artist to be somewhat of a disappointment, this is still the writer who thrilled me with White Noise and The Names.  This is the man who wrote the incredibly beautiful prologue to Underworld.  DeLillo can flat out Write.<br />The basic plot of Cosmopolis follows Eric Packer, a 28 year old billionaire, as he crosses New York City (pre 9/11) in his limo to get a haircut.  Such a simple trip takes all day since the President is in town and there is marches, riots and a funeral.  At the same time, Packer is told that someone is out to kill him.  Confused?  Don't worry, DeLillo uses plot as a device to enable him to riff on aspects of society and while the characters do not sound like real people, it is the characters the provide the interest and pacing of the narrative.  In Cosmopolis, DeLillo takes on high finance and the lives of the ultra-rich.  DeLillo's view is very comic and deeply scathing as he reveals how shallow these lives really are.<br />As talented as Don DeLillo is as a writer, this was not a very engaging novel.  While plot and character are merely devices for DeLillo (instead of being the point), in a better novel this is not a problem and would barely be noticeable.  The fact is that all of the characters sound the same and given a different name would be identical to the other characters.  There is very little distinction between characters.  This is not unusual for DeLillo, but again, in a better novel I wouldn't be thinking about that.<br />Cosmopolis is a step back in the right direction for DeLillo (after the awful novel The Body Artist), but would still only fall in the middle of his body of work.  This is a middle tier novel from a top tier talent.	2003-04-14

The book takes place 12 years after the events in The Source of Magic.  Bink's son is twelve years old, and has a Magician Class talent.  Dor can talk to inanimate objects (they audibly speak to him).  Dor is the heir apparent to the throne of Xanth, but he still has to deal with the same issues that any 12 year old might have to deal with.  In his case, loneliness.  King Trent, in hopes to help mature Dor, sends him on a quest to The Good Magician Humphrey to discover a way to reanimate the Zombie Jonathon.  Millie the Ghost, no longer a ghost loves Jonathon, but Jonathon is still a zombie.  Humphrey knows of a way to get an elixir to heal Jonathon, but it can only be acquired from the Zombie Master, a Magician who lived 800 years earlier.<br />The Good Magician gives Dor a spell to put him into a tapestry that shows the events of that time period.  In this way, Dor occupies the body of a Mundane warrior during the 4th Wave of Mundane Invasion.  The King at the time is the legendary King Roogna.  In Dor's quest for the elixir he encounters the Magicians of the time and gets involved in the very civil conflict between King Roogna and the Magician Murphy.<br />This book is one of the better Xanth novels (i.e. one of the first Xanth novels) and while it gives part of the history of the land (always important), it also introduces characters who will later become important players in the series (Dor, Iris, Murphy, Vadne).	2003-04-04
US	52402330	R1R4QW3BC0RCAT	0375756140	949337727	The Cost of Living	Books	4	6	8	N	N	very compelling writing	The Cost of Living is the second book by Arundhati Roy, but is her first non fiction book. Her first book was the phenomenally good novel The God of Small Things . The Cost of Living is a collection of two essays.<br />The first is \\"The Greater Common Good\\" and deals with the building of the Big Dams in India (Roy is native to India and still lives there). Roy writes about some of the politics involved in the building of the dams and makes clear enormity of the human cost and the lives lost and displaced. Roy is vehemently against this ongoing project, and while this essay only presents one side of the argument, it is still a well crafted and well written and emotionally compelling argument.<br />The second essay is \\"The End of Imagination\\". This essay was written in 1998 shortly after India had revealed that it was doing nuclear testing. Apparently, the party line was that nuclear weaponry = patriotism = Hinduism = India. By this logic, any Indian who was not in favor of the testing was also against India itself. Flawed logic, and Roy takes the government to task focusing on nuclear testing when so much of the nation is starving, uneducated, and needs true assistance. Roy's arguments against nuclear testing are wide ranging. She discusses the fact that most of the nation is uneducated and does not know what it means to have nuclear weapons and what the negatives are. She writes against the government, lining its pockets at the expense of the nation. She writes against the United States for introducing the nuclear game to the world. The biggest loser in this game, Roy believes, is India. India believes itself to be a world player, but Roy explains the national delusion and why this is simply not the case.<br />This is a short, but interesting book. Roy is an excellent writer and while her thoughts skirt the extreme, she writes with a passion that cannot be ignored.	2003-04-01

Some reviewers have commented on the lack of hard science involved in this book.  I wasn't expecting any.  This is a book on the observable emotions of cats and the examples used are the 5 young cats of the author.  As would be expected, the book contains the author's prejudices regarding his cats and how they should live and behave.  As such, this is a fairly interesting book.<br />The book deals with nine emotions: Narcissism, Love, Contentment, Attachment, Jealousy, Fear, Anger, Curiosity, and Playfulness.  Each of these are granted a chapter (or to be more accurate, a section) in the book.  I do own a cat (he is 10 months at the time I write this), but I am not familiar with a lot of the feline emotions.  The insight provided in this book can be obtained simply be observing cats for extended periods of time, but it is interesting to have it all in one place.  It must be stressed, however, the Masson does not do extensive research (though he is well read).  Most of the information provided comes from the author's observance of his 5 cats.<br />Masson stresses that cats cannot be happy unless they have the opportunity to freely wander outside.  This may or may not be true, but for most people not living on a beach in New Zealand in a very safe neighborhood, this just is not an option.  We provide the best life possible for our cats, but sometimes the cat can only be an indoors cat and I do not feel that my cat is living a horrible life.<br />The author is well-intentioned in writing this book, but we should not assume that everything he says is exactly correct.  Our own observations will give us the truth of Masson's statements.	2003-03-27

The guide gives an excellent walkthrough for the main story of the game without spoiling the story.  There is a lot of detail in finding the items in sidequests and getting all of the Al Bhed primer.  My lone gripe is that while all of the Primers are listed, they missed a couple during the walkthrough and i missed my chance (one of them permanently) to get them.  Normally, any boss strategy is just to whomp them until they die,  but this gives fairly detailed strategies...some of which are very helpful.<br />If FFX is giving you any trouble, this guide is worth getting.	2003-03-26
US	52402330	RYHFLVRSDIT5P	0345350588	447211642	Source of Magic (Xanth)	Books	5	18	20	N	N	one of the best in Xanth	This is the second book in Anthony's Xanth series. The world of Xanth is build upon puns, all of the creatures and the landscape is puns taken from real life and used literally. The tone of Xanth is fairly light-hearted, and I've always considered this to be a light fantasy series (as opposed to the more serious and emotionally darker fantasy series).<br />Bink found his magical talent in A Spell for Chameleon , is now married, and works as a magic researcher for King Trent. With his wife nine months pregnant and very angry, Bink is sent off on a quest to discover the source of the magic in Xanth. Bink will be accompanied by his friend, Chester the Centaur, the Good Magician Humphrey, and Grundy the Golem. Being only the second Xanth novel, this one is has a decent story and is well written. Even though I have read this before (years back), I still cared what happened to these characters. The quest for the source of magic is interesting, and the payoff when Bink finds it (as if he wouldn't) is worth the price of admission. This is an excellent Xanth novel with more drama than later books. This is one of the best in the series.	2003-03-25

This is a fair enough way to rate the book since if a person does not like Jewel, they will probably not like her autobiography. I fall in between the two groups. I am a big fan of Jewel and absolutely loved her new album This Way . I did not, however, love her book.<br />The format of this memoir is a series of selections from her journal. We see personal glimpses of her life as she sees it. Jewel is reflecting on her life, her childhood, and where she is now. As far as we can tell, this is a very honest book and it is filled with some painful recollections of her childhood, and her family life. She also writes of her best friend and watching her die in the hospital. Jewel has a very open and clear writing style and this is a breeze to read.<br />I said that I did not love this book, and that much is true. It is not a horrible book, and I do not feel that it is worth a 1 star rating. This is simply a middle of the road book with nothing truly special about it. Had this not been written by Jewel, it would have disappeared quickly and probably not been read. As far as memoirs go, this one isn't anything special. As memoir by Jewel, it is probably only of interest to her fans. And then only to some of them.	2003-03-25

White Teeth was a top rate book and could be considered Literature....with a capital L. The Autograph Man is more light-hearted, and a faster paced novel. It is much more obviously comic but still demonstrates Zadie Smith's extraordinary gift as a novelist.<br />The story follows Alex-Li Tandem, a Chinese-Jewish Autograph Dealer from London. This might be the most normal part of the story. Alex's father dies taking Alex and two other boys (who are not Alex's friends at the time but remain lifelong friends) to a wrestling match. Alex is obsessed with 1950's actress Kitty Alexander and in his sub-culture of Autograph dealers, Alexander's signature is worth thousands of dollars...all because of its rarity. Alex tries to get her autograph and eventually travels to America to meet her. Nothing in this book is normal, or conventional, but all of it is interesting.<br />While this may not be as Good (capital G) a novel as White Teeth , this is more of an accessible novel and is still a good contemporary novel. The Autograph Man did not garner the critical attention that her first novel did, and it would not have deserved it if it had, but this novel is also being held up to a difficult standard. The Autograph Man succeeds in keeping me interested most of the way through the book (it loses focus somewhat at the end and just sort of trails off) and also keeps me interested in seeing what Zadie Smith's next novel will be.	2003-03-21

The series began in 1977 when The Sword of Shannara was published, the early books have been compared often with Tolkien. Sometimes the comparison was favorable, sometimes not. Brooks himself said that he wanted to tell an adventure story like Tolkien, but he had no intention of going into the linguistic detail that Tolkien is known for. The Shannara series has been on top of the bestsellers lists with each new volume in the series.<br />Sometimes the Magic Works is part memoir, part writing guide as written by Terry Brooks. He writes about how his first book was published, some of the difficulties in writing the book that would become The Elfstones of Shannara , and about the book adaptions of Hook (horrible experience) and The Phantom Menace (wonderful experience). The other half of the book focuses on tips and thoughts for aspiring writers. Brooks writes about things that a writer should do, what they should not do, and what works for Brooks himself. There is an interesting chapter about outlining (yes, an author talking about outlining is actually interesting). Brooks talks about how he has to outline the major plot and characters and while he believes it is an invaluable tool (and the reason he does fewer drafts of the book than many writers), he was at a conference and as he was extolling the virtues of outlining, fantasy author Anne McCaffrey (The Dragonriders of Pern, and author of dozens of books) leaned over and told him that she has never outlined anything in her life.<br />Sometimes the Magic Works is written with a very easy writing style, and feels almost conversational, as if an old friend is telling us some personal stories. This was a very interesting book to read and it was nice to get into the personal thoughts of one of my favorite fantasy authors.	2003-03-18

Lewis is one of the premier Christian thinkers of the twentieth century, and his words and ideas have given comfort and inspiration to many Christians throughout the years. C. S. Lewis is thoughtful, intelligent writer. He is a scholar and an intellectual. He is one of the most important Christian writers of the twentieth century.<br />There are several essays that have clear relevance today, both in our personal Christian life as well as in how we relate to the world. \\"The Weight of Glory\\" focuses on what it means to be children of God and that while cultures and nations are all mortal things (they will come to an end), it is humans that are truly immortal in that we will live with God long after this world is gone. Lewis speaks about how we should be like children, realizing how special everyone truly is, and that they too are immortals. Lewis explains it better. \\"The Weight of Glory\\" has been described as the best thing Lewis has ever written. While I haven't read everything Lewis has written yet, there is no question that this is one of his most important essays.<br />Other essays in the collection include \\"Why I Am Not a Pacifist\\" (giving a Christian viewpoint on the subject that I had not encountered before), \\"The Inner Ring\\" (dealing with cliques in general and in church), \\"Membership\\", and \\"On Forgiveness\\".<br />This is an important book to read as a Christian, and perhaps an interesting one to read if one is not a Christian.	2003-03-17

This one focuses on the first female wizard on the Disc. The little girl in question, Esk, is the eighth son of an eighth son. At least, that's what the dying wizard who was passing on his powers thought. It turns out, that the eighth son is a daughter, and the first wizard of the Disc is born.<br />The story is not as sweeping as the first two Discworld novels, but because of the nature of the story, it works perfectly. Up until close to the end, the story is fairly small, dealing with the girl, the attempt to get her into the Unseen University, and the prejudices against female wizards. As always, Equal Rites is told with Terry Pratchett's odd sense of humor. Another good one from Pratchett.	2003-03-17

It was written by Mark Bowden, the author of the exceptional book: Black Hawk Down . Since this book was advertised as \\"the manhunt for Pablo Escobar\\", I went into the book expecting a kind of adventure story dealing with the killing of Pablo. Instead, what I got was a well crafted story detailing the early life (as much as is known) of Pablo Escobar and his rise to power in Columbia through the drug trade, how Escobar became such an international target, the many years of failed attempts to capture and kill Escobar, his many escapes, and finally how Escobar was tracked down and killed.<br />Having read this book after Black Hawk Down , I expected the level of detail that Bowden presents, and if the story is less gripping than that of his other book, the story is no less interesting. We know how it ends, but we don't know how it all went down. The story of Pablo Escobar may not be very well known, but Mark Bowden wrote an excellent book that deserves to be read.	2003-03-17

I decided to check it out. It has always been difficult for me to get excited about a new fantasy series, it feels like a major investment of time and I don't want it to be a waste. But, with the Terry Brooks recommendation and blurbs on the back cover from Melanie Rawn and Katherine Kurtz, I was willing to give the book a chance. I'm glad that I did.<br />The Briar King will suffer from inevitable comparisons to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time and to George Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire . While such comparisons are only natural, they are unfair. A fantasy series needs time to develop over several books to be fairly compared to another major series. Also, while there are a couple of stylistic similarities, The Briar King is wholly distinct. It also stands up quite well on its own.<br />The novel begins thousands of years before the main story, as we see the origins of the land and the prophecy that will begin to shape the events of the book. The novel follows several characters: the headstrong daughter of a king, a woodsman, and a bookish scholar. While some of these paths to intertwine at points, there is quite a bit going on to build the world as a real place as well as creating a detailed story that will be a joy to follow over 4 books. The series will be called The Kingdoms of Thorn and Bone and will be four books.<br />This is an exciting new fantasy series, and any fan of Robert Jordan or George Martin owes it to him or herself to check this one out.	2003-03-14

While I enjoyed the first novel, I wasn't too impressed with it. The Light Fantastic is a much better book and actually has a plot. When we last saw Rincewind and Twoflower, they had fallen off the edge of the Disc (and were being followed quickly by the luggage made of sapient pearwood). This is where The Light Fantastic picks up. Once again, we have the misadventures of Rincewind and Twoflower as they decide to return back to Ankh- Morpork (did I spell that correctly?). They meet up with Cohen the Barbarian (currently, my favorite character), an aging hero with a bad back and no teeth. And, oh yeah, the world is in danger from a comet (as far as they know) about to crash into the Disc and the only spell that can save the Disc is lodged in Rincewind's head. After reading this book, I am much more interested in reading more Discworld novels.	2003-03-06

Now that I have finished Rainbow Six , I only have two left. If you have read other Clancy novels, you know what kind of book this is. The pacing is somewhat faster than other Clancy novels, but nowhere near as fast as Without Remorse. Now that Jack Ryan is President of the United States, Rainbow Six switches the focus back onto CIA operative John Clark. Clark has made appearances in most of the Jack Ryan series, as well as being the focus of Without Remorse.<br />With the permission and blessing of multiple nations, John Clark is the head of a multi-national anti-terrorism group named Rainbow (Clark, being an intelligence man, has the code name of Six). Rainbow is split into two teams, one of them headed by Clarks partner and former CIA office, Domingo (Ding) Chavez. These teams are trained and authorized to respond to terrorist actions across Europe (or anywhere else in the world). As Rainbow is formed is begins to come together, there are more high profile terrorist actions. Rainbow responds, perfectly. At the same time, there is a plotline focusing on a team of scientists developing a virus to kill most of the population of the planet (yes, weve all seen that movie before, but Clancy makes it semi-believable). Tom Clancy weaves together several plotlines into a gripping narrative and makes for very interesting reading.<br />Im reluctant to put this book near the top of the list in terms of Clancys best work, but this is a very solid novel and Clancy seldom writes [poorly]. This is far from [poor] and is quite good. Definitely worth a read, if you are a fan of Tom Clancy.	2003-03-05

She does not know how to tie her own shoes, and as everybody knows, the number one rule of kindergarten is that you must know how to tie your own shoes and you cant ask anyone. Ever. The illustrations in this book are perfect as the little girl addresses the reader directly. This should engage any children reading the book.

While I'm fully capable of doing this on a regular basis, it's been a while since I've killed a book in a day. It's been even longer since a Grisham novel has been interesting enough to do so. This one was. The basic story has the protagonist starting as a public defender investigating a murder case. In the middle of the investigation, he meets a man who hands him a class action lawsuit to take care of. The man gives his name, but not that of his company. While the lawsuit is legitimate, the manner of acquiring this case and being assured of winning the settlement is a little shady. Our protagonist accepts and wins, and becomes rich. He is handed another class action lawsuit, a bigger one. This one he must do the work to get the clients, but the evidence is handed to him. He hits the jackpot with a 100 Million Dollar payday. He is dubbed the King of Torts. As time goes on and he continues to push for more money and bigger case, we see our protagonist go from being the perfectly honest public defender to being a typical, greedy lawyer. Until very close to the end, there is no true conflict in the story, it is driven instead by the character of the protagonist (his name really isn't important). Near the end, the legal issues of what the Protagonist has been doing finally comes into play.<br />I'm not going to claim this is one of Grisham's best novels, because it doesn't measure up to his early work (everything is on the surface in this novel, there is no real depth). However, this is his most entertaining book in years, probably since the Testament. Grisham seems to be giving us the highly entertaining books spaced out between much weaker novels. Hopefully the next book will be as entertaining as this one and have the depth of the earlier works.	2003-03-04

Most of the books I've read have been personal biographies and focused mostly on the situations regarding that particular wrestler (be it Mick Foley, Hulk Hogan, or Bobby Heenan). These books have not dealt with WWF Corporate or with Vince McMahon (except as he related to the performer). Sex, Lies, and Headlocks focuses directly on WWF Corporate and Vince McMahon himself.<br />The book begins by tracing the origins of the WWF. Even before Vince McMahon, Jr was born, we see his father starting his own federation and competing directly against the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). No mention is made, however, of the fact that Vincent McMahon, Sr, was on the board of the NWA and helped decide on who the NWA Champion would be. We do see McMahon, Sr, build up the WWWF (World Wide Wrestling Federation) and have it be a successful federation on the east coast. McMahon, Sr. wanted his son to have nothing to do with the business but Vince was persistent and eventually became a ring announcer for his father. As time went on, Vince was given his own federation to own (a smaller regional federation). By the time his father was ready to retire, Vince was prepared to buy the WWWF. He did so and renamed it the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He was able to put together a company that while it was not losing money, it was not making very much, either. It wasn't until he decided to take a huge risk in putting together a huge event on closed circuit television that Vince was able to make his company a success. That even was Wrestlemania.<br />If this book was only about the rise of the WWF, it would still be an interesting book....but it wouldn't be as good. This book also chronicles the rise of Ted Turner's WCW and how Vince McMahon ended up purchasing his long time rival's company. We are also introduced to the amount of steroid use that was rampant in the WWF in the 1980's (and may very well still be).

US	52402330	R3CY3YMOIVIDIR	0061020710	181852028	The Color of Magic	Books	4	2	4	N	N	the first Discworld novel shows the promise of the series	The Color of Magic is the first of 27 (at the moment) novels set in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series. Discworld is a strange world. On one hand, it reminds me of Piers Anthony's Xanth , but Pratchett's tone is more serious and the world is less childish than Xanth . They share the concept of taking ideas from the real world and twisting them into something else. Anthony twists real life things into puns, Pratchett twists them in order to satirize them. Pratchett is much more effective this way as a writer. After reading countless reviews that make mention of Discworld, I finally decided to start the series. I began with the understanding that it is the later books that are best, as Pratchett had not yet hit his stride with the humor. That's fine, I knew what I was coming up against. Sort of.<br />Pratchett doesn't just take aspects of the real world and twist them, he twists much of the rules of conventional fantasy. Everything is a farce, even as he tells a story. At times, I wasn't sure what the plot was, but everything was interesting. During much of the story, I found things mildly amusing, and on several occasions I found something funny. Nothing to compare to what I've heard about later books.<br />The plot follows a failed wizard named Rincewind as he acts as a tour guide for Discworld's first tourist, Twoflower. Twoflower is somewhat of a bumpkin and Rincewind has incredibly bad luck, so along with luggage that follows them around, they end up in predicament after predicament. To attempt to detail the plot out would be folly as it would make no sense to anyone who hasn't yet read a Discworld novel.<br />While not quite as good as I had hoped, it is enough to keep me reading a few more novels in the Discworld to see if things are really as good as everyone seems to say.	2003-02-24

This is a compliment. Jurassic Park is perhaps Crichton's best novel. In many ways, Prey is quite similar. Substitute dinosaurs for nanomachines, and you've got a storyline that is very close to that of Jurassic Park . That's okay, Jurassic Park was a very strong and interesting book.<br />Crichton is very good at presenting complex theoretical science in a way that is both understandable (in a very rough form) as well as believable. While we may not be close to being able to achieve the science in Crichton's novels, he makes us believe that perhaps it is possible, at least for the length of a novel. In that, he is a very successful writer.<br />The basic story is that nano-machines are possible and after years of the theory being discussed, one company has actually created them. As each individual nano-machine is smaller than dust, they are designed to travel through veins and transmit images of what they see. Jack is the narrator, he is unemployed having been fired from his software job for whistle-blowing (a co-worker was selling company secrets, but the boss was in on it). Jack's wife works for the company making the nano-machines. He suspects that she is cheating on him. A swarm of nano-machines has gotten free from the laboratory and is potentially a danger. Strange things are beginning to happen at Jack's house.<br />A very interesting and well told story. It is fast paced and I didn't want to put the book down. Recommended.	2003-02-20

This was my Valentine's Day gift. My girlfriend tells me that I'm so opinionated about stuff that I could have written this book. She may be right. I think I can remember yelling \\"but Twinkies [are gross]!\\" while reading the book. Maybe I just thought it very loud. I've never been to the website that this guy rates stuff for, but Sjoberg rates everything under the sun (from the Seven Dwarfs, to food made by Hostess, to national sports, to....well, anything and everything). It's very interesting.<br />The structure of the book is in two to three page segments, each one covering a topic. Sjoberg picks several aspects of the topic, give a brief rating of each, and then a letter grade (an example of this would be the Seven Dwarfs as a topic, and then each dwarf gets a short paragraph and the letter grade). The book is consistently amusing with some very funny one-liners tacked in there.<br />I liked this book, it reminded me of high school where we would make all sorts of lists and put them in order of best to worst. This is a better written extension of that.	2003-02-19

I read this for the first time when I was in 8th grade, I believe (now 23 years old). At the time I found it to be a simple, fun to read novel that got me interested in the world Piers Anthony created. It also got me interested in other fantasy novels, and I moved along from Anthony to Eddings, Brooks, McCaffrey, Feist, Jordan, and Martin. Anthony's Xanth series is what got me started, however.<br />I think I've read about half of the Xanth series, and it is apparent that the novels are becoming less and less serious. The books become filled with puns, and everything magic is punned. A Spell for Chameleon is the first Xanth novel, however, and there is very little of the punning that the series is known for (and may be the downfall of the series). This first novel sets up the series and defines what Xanth is and what kind of land this is. Xanth is shaped like Florida, but is not actually connected to the United States. It is a separate world filled with magic. Anthony teases that all of the magical creatures in Earth's legends actually were real (dragons, centaur, harpy, sphinx, etc), but they came from Xanth by mistake. Xanth is a magic land is somehow connected to our world, but not in any fixed location. The human population of Xanth was settled by Mundanes (our world is called Mundania) in a series of waves of Invasion, as the Mundanes (from various parts of the world) discovered passages to Xanth. While humans don't naturally have magic when they arrive, any children born in Xanth do in fact possess magic.<br />When this novel begins, we know there is a Shield blocking any more Waves of invasion from Mundania (prior waves had been mostly violent). The king is an old man with failing health and he has decreed that any citizen who has reached his 25th birthday must be able to demonstrate his magical talent (everyone has just one) or be exiled to Mundania (beyond the Shield). Bink is a young man nearing his 25th birthday and he has not yet discovered his talent. He is journeying to the Good Magician Humphrey to discover his talent. As Bink travels, we learn more about what type of land Xanth is, and discover some of the most prominent features of the land. Humphrey knows that Bink has a Magician level talent, but is unable figure out what the talent is. Bink is still to be exiled.<br />While I feel that the novel has lost something over the years, it was still a very enjoyable read and it is fun to revisit the world of Xanth.his 25th birthday and he has not yet discovered his talent.

She is an incredibly gifted novelist. Grandmother's Pigeon is her first book for children.<br />I haven't read a book written specifically for children in well over a decade (Harry Potter and The Narnia series would be more for young adults and are suitable for adults on different levels), but Grandmother's Pigeon is a true children's book. It is only about 30 pages, half of which are illustrations. Like any good children's book, this one is mixed with the simple and the fantastic (perhaps all the more understandable considering Erdrich's American Indian heritage). The story is simple, a grandmother goes away on a trip and bird eggs are discovered in her room. When the eggs hatch, the birds turn out to be Passenger Pigeons (a long extinct species), three males. There is some commotion about the pigeons and finally they are released into the wild by the family. The fantastic comes in from the very start when Grandmother announces she is going to travel to Greenland on the back of a turtle and it is hinted the a stuffed animal toy pigeon may have been the cause of the mysterious eggs. It is a very sweet, charming story and I would imagine any child would enjoy reading this book.	2003-02-17

Erdrich has been my favorite author ever since I read Love Medicine while in college. Her newest novel does not disappoint at all.<br />The novel follows two people, Fidelis and Delphine. We first meet Fidelis shortly after World War I. He is a German and is going home to meet the fianc&eacute; of his best friend in the war. He marries Eva and they move to America and end up living in Argus, North Dakota. He works first in Pete Kozka's butcher shop (we meet Pete in her earlier novel The Beet Queen ), and later opens his own shop. Delphine is a native of Argus and is living with an Indian named Cyprian Lazarre (a family well know in Erdrich's work for dishonesty), who happens to be a homosexual. The paths of Fidelis and Delphine cross and their lives become intertwined in several different ways.<br />Erdrich's gifts as a storyteller only seem to be getting stronger as she continues to write novels. This is an excellent novel.  She is a master storyteller.  While few novels will match up to The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse , this is a first rate novel and is essential reading for anyone who enjoys reading Erdrich or excellent novels.	2003-02-12
US	52402330	R18FVGDPWN36BN	0743456904	9113921	Hollywood Hulk Hogan (World Wrestling Entertainment)	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Hogan is full of himself, but this was very interesting	After reading several reviews on this book by former wrestlers and by people in the know of the events described in this book, I was skeptical. The reviews state that Hogan embellished and flat out made up some events described in the book. While Hulk Hogan has indeed been in the forefront of the biggest movements in professional wrestling, he also takes credit for nearly every major idea that has come out of those movements (the concept of merchandising, Hulkamania, the NWO, building up certain wrestlers, etc). Just about the only thing Hogan didn't take credit for was the invention of the internet, and that's probably because Al Gore already grabbed that one.<br />While there are embellishments in the autobiography, I think that it does give a pretty good picture of who Terry Bollea is. We know the impact that Hulk Hogan had on the wrestling world. He, with Vince McMahon Jr, helped bring wrestling to the mainstream of popular culture. There is not much detail in Hogan's book, but we get to see a nice overview of his life, especially when he was first starting out in the business. I knew that Brutus the Barber Beefcake was Hogan's friend, but I didn't know how far back they went. Hogan addresses controversies surrounding his career and he has a fairly interesting take on much of his life. The format of the book is short chapters on various subjects. Not too much detail, perhaps some inaccuracy, but highly entertaining.	2003-02-10

Books	4	7	14	N	N	thought provoking	Stupid White Men is filmmaker Michael ( Roger and Me , Bowling for Columbine ) Moore's third book. Part political/social commentary, part humor, this was a very interesting book to read. Moore gives his opinions on topics such as the 2000 Presidential Election, the lack of difference between Democrats and Republicans, education, the real dangers of white people, and other subjects. His opinions closely mirror those of Ralph Nader's Green Party (a fact which Moore readily admits).<br />Michael Moore calls President George W Bush the Thief in Chief and always makes sure to put the title \\"President\\" in quotes. Moore maintains that Bush deliberately stole the election in Florida. While Moore makes mention several times that Al Gore won the popular vote, the popular vote is not what decides elections. The electorate vote is what decides elections and the electorate is determined state by state. It is Moore's stance that Bush, his brother and other friends/associates worked to defraud and disenfranchise thousands of black voters and that Bush had pushed to close the recounts as soon as he had any sort of a lead. With the voter fraud, not to mention the poor balloting procedures in several Florida counties, Moore gives evidence that Bush defrauded the nation by stealing the presidential election. If these allegations are true, Bush has no right to public office. The problem is that Moore does not document his sources very well. It does appear that he cites all his sources in the notes section at the end of the book, but it isn't very well organized. The citations include comments like \\"the facts can be found in the article...\\". That is all well and good, but he doesn't identify which facts and figures he is quoting, so we don't know if Moore is making anything up and what he is exaggerating for effect.<br />For most of the book, Moore comes off as somewhat shrill when discussing Republicans. Their stances on criminal justice, abortion, and social issues deeply offend Michael Moore and so when he makes a list of the ills of any particular administration, he includes things like faith-based charities, opposition to late term abortion, the death penalty. While some issues I believe he has a point on (environmental ones, mostly), I do disagree with many issues that Moore is so adamant about.<br />I give Moore credit for writing a well thought out, interesting and funny book.

US	52402330	R26MV1TWXO2YZJ	0800871863	431949761	Silence	Books	4	2	3	N	N	powerful	Silence is set in 17th Century Japan during an incredible period of persecution towards Christians (both Japanese and foreign). The novel deals with this persecution and the ramifications of priests turning apostate and denying their faith.<br />The protagonist is a Portuguese priest named Sebastian Rodrigues. He learns of his mentor, Padre Ferreira, who after years of mission work denied Christ under torture. This is after Ferreira wrote glowing letters about Japanese Christians who had held fast to their faith under such persecution and torture. Rodrigues traveled to Japan to learn if these rumors are true (as the letters from Ferreira stopped) and if Ferreira really did apostatize. As one of the only priests in Japan, Rodrigues has to sneak into the country and immediately go into hiding, all the while performing his priestly duties to a Christian brotherhood that has not had contact with clergy in years. Knowing only his companion, Rodrigues has no idea where to look for Ferreira. His time in Japan is spent in persecution and in hiding.<br />This novel is a study in the path from strong faith to doubt and how religious persecution affects faith. While the novel is not exactly cheerful and the ending is not uplifting as one might expect with a novel with this topic (the usual expectation would be some sort of redemption in the end), this is a very well written novel, even in translation. Excellent work by Mr. Endo.	2003-02-03

Harry is to begin his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. During the summers, he lives with his aunt and uncle. They are not at all fond of magic and keep Harry away in his closet, forbidden to use magic (by the school) or have any contact with his friends. Harry's parents were murdered by an evil wizard when Harry was only an infant. Harry survived, mysteriously, unscathed except for a scar on his forehead. Harry arrives at Hogwarts having learned that a man named Sirius Black has escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban. Presumably he wants to kill Harry Potter. Black was a convicted murderer and worked for the wizard who killed Harry's parents.<br />The school is almost in a lockdown with the frightening Dementor guards looking for Black and guarding the school. Harry, of course, gets into mischief anyways and winds up involved in finding Sirius Black. There are plenty of surprises and Rowling writes this book with fast pacing and an interesting story.<br />This is one of the strongest books of the four, and with this book, the series is beginning to get noticeably darker and less for children than it was before. While not very frightening for an adult, the book may be scary for a young child. Though these are marketed for children, the Harry Potter series is as much for adults as it is for children. Excellent reading.	2003-02-03
US	52402330	R2Q62LWWUY6N9	0399142185	506174805	Executive Orders	Books	5	2	4	N	N	excellent, hopefully not as prophetic as Debt of Honor.	Executive Orders is Tom Clancy's follow up to his best selling novel Debt of Honor and begins moments after the ending of the previous novel. Debt of Honor left the Capitol building destroyed, the President killed, most of Congress killed, and all 9 members of the Supreme Court killed. Most other top officials of the government were also killed in a horrible attack reminiscent of September 11, 2001 (even though the novel was written years before that event). While not intending to be, Tom Clancy was very prophetic in writing about the events that led up to Executive Orders . Because the Vice President had resigned, Jack Ryan was asked to take his place until the next election. As Vice President, Jack Ryan was not in the building when the attacks took place. Being Vice President was only supposed to be a one-year post and then he would retire from public service. Now with the President dead, Jack Ryan is the new President of the United States. Most Presidents have a Cabinet and Congress and other Senior Officials to help make the transition to power run smoothly. Jack Ryan has to rebuild his government almost from the ground up.<br />Tom Clancy writes large, sprawling novels. This one is actually a bit longer than most other Clancy novels, coming in at nearly 900 pages. There is a lot of storyline to cover. Clancy likes to have the main plotline with several sub-plots that eventually tie in to the main story and also augment what is going on. Only one of these sub-plots felt truly superfluous (that being the Mountain Men sub-plot) as it did not actually add anything to the main plotline nor did it even touch the main story. It was set up early as something large and fizzled out near the end, as if Clancy forgot that he had that sub-plot going and then realized that he didn't have anywhere for it to go. Otherwise, all the storylines fit into the larger story and with all the detail that Clancy provides, the novel doesn't feel as weighty as it would appear to be.<br />The detail that Tom Clancy provides gives the novel a sense of realism, that perhaps these events are not so implausible as we might have once thought. After September 11 and with threats of bio-terrorism, this novel has gone from being military/political fiction to a grim vision of what may very well occur in our near future. We see the potential for evil in the world and dishonest men in the United States (and abroad). We see the potential for good men and women to step up in government service and to attempt to do the right thing. Clancy shows both sides of the coin, and if Jack Ryan is an overly honest and morally upright character....we must remember that he is the \\"hero\\" of the series. He is exactly the kind of man we want this series of books to revolve around.<br />The bottom line for this novel is that it is well written, and while it may be long winded at times, it was a quick reading novel despite being around 900 pages. The story is compelling and while we know that our hero and our country will come out alright, we don't know what horrific events Clancy will subject Jack Ryan and America to....and that's why we keep reading.>The detail that Tom Clancy provides gives the novel a sense of realism, that perhaps these events are not so implausible as we might have once thought.

He died when he was only 24, but he held every American record between 2000 meters and 10,000 meters. He had not yet hit his prime. Even 25 years after his death, he still inspires runners today.<br />This volume is not so much a biography of his life as it is a recap of his running career. This book was published before either Prefontaine or Without Limits had hit theaters. While examining the career of Pre, we see a much clearer picture of who he was and we see facets of Pre that the films did not show (as well as things that the films got wrong). While he did have problems with the AAU (somewhat glossed over in the book), he did get to race against some of the top international competition that the movies claim he never raced against (except for the 1972 Olympics). In fact, he did race against Viren and other top athletes over in Europe.<br />This is a short book, less than 200 pages, and I'm not sure it would be interesting to anyone not interested in running already. But for me, a former collegiate cross country runner....i really enjoyed this book.	2003-01-20

I am not convinced this series will ever end. Jordan claims that he has known the ending since before he began writing the first book, but it doesn't appear that he is that much closer to completion. He claims there is going to be 2 or 3 more books. But he said that same thing 2 or 3 books ago. We'll see.<br />With that out of the way, I'll start talking about the book. Ever since the incredible ending to Winter's Heart , I've been eagerly waiting for the next WOT novel. A release date was set, and pushed back. Finally I was able to buy this book and start reading. I was expecting and hoping that the book would follow up from the ending of book 9. I soon realized that most of this book takes place at the same time as the pivotal event of Winter's Heart , so while the story can advance for the other characters, not a lot of time will pass (and so not that much closer to the Last Battle). Because of the time constraint, not a lot of action happens. This is not a bad thing because the other characters needed some time to have their stories developed more.<br />The character that benefits from this the most is Mat. He had been sorely lacking in the previous couple of books and his chapters are the best of the novel. Perrin and Egwene suffer from the same problem. Nothing happens until the end of their appearances in the book where Perrin makes a very importance decision that may have serious ramifications throughout the world and Egwene actually acts instead of just sitting at the siege at Tar Valon. Elayne is also featured in several consecutive chapters in the middle of the book and while they are moderately interesting....i'm really wanting the whole succession situation in Andor to be resolved.<br />Even though Winter's Heart had such an incredible ending and my hopes for the pace of the series to pick up again....it hasn't. Crossroads of Twilight is a fast reading book, but there is not a serious advancement of plot. Most likely this is because WOT is really one large book and not a 10 + volume series. It is one story and in any novel, there are slow parts and character development parts....and unfortunately we get entire novels of that. This is one of them.<br />This is not to say that Crossroads of Twilight is a bad book, because it is not. It is a good one (when taken as part of the greater series). I couldn't put this book down and I wasn't ready for it to end.<br />Any complaints I have with the book are ultimately small. I enjoyed Crossroads of Twilight very much and I am already anticipating book 11 in this series even though it will likely be 2 years until I see the next book.

His first book was the excellent memoir A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius and it pushed the boundaries of what memoir can be. It was creative, original, and an excellent read. I was very interested in reading his new book, fiction this time. ...I really like how it is set up. The novel begins on the front cover (there is no dust jacket) and continues on the inside front cover and moves on from there. Eggers occasionally uses pictures and other little tricks to show the reader that this is not being told or written in a conventional way. There are no chapters, but the story is broken up into days (Monday, Tuesday, etc).<br />Other reviews point out that the ending was implausible and just tacked on. I disagree. I found the entire novel implausible, so I was able to ignore that part of the story. The narrative follows Will and Hand as they travel across the planet in a quest to give away $34,000 that Will mysteriously acquired. The story and novel is an interesting concept, but it isn't well told at all. There is no reason to care for Will or Hand and to be honest, I started hoping they'd get mugged or killed....but I knew I still had more pages to go so they stay alive in order to give reason for those last 100 pages. The novel just wasn't that well written or well thought out. I know that Eggers did a fair amount of research into the locations his characters was going to visit, and the locations in the novel feel authentic...but the story is ultimately empty.<br />All of the promise of AHWOSG is lost in this novel.	2003-01-20

In fact, he does tell you...right in the biography. It is actually a fairly effective technique. Caro points out the flaws and problems with other Johnson biographies and thus justifies the need and superiority of his own first volume. This is the first volume in what was projected to be a 3 volume set (and now appears to be at least 4). This volume follows Johnson from childhood up to his failed first run for the U.S. Senate in 1941.<br />This biography has an abundance of detail, so much so that it is easy to forget that you are reading a biography and think that you are reading a novel. The story is that compelling and i got wrapped up in it. We see the circumstances of the formative years of a man who would later become President of the United States.<br />We are presented with the two primary facets of Lyndon Johnson's personality. We see a master politician able to gain the power to further his own aims and increase his sphere of influence. We see this master politician serve the needs of his constituency, getting benefits for veterans, bring affordable electricity to rural Texas for the very first time, helping legislation pass to get a dam built. Lyndon Johnson did a lot of good. He could almost be admired if he wasn't such a horrible person.<br />To start with, Lyndon Johnson treated like ... anyone whose help he did not need. He was a liar and was dishonest, even for a politician. He stole elections, even college elections. He is a man who craved nothing but personal power and had the ambition and lack of personal morality to get it. If Lyndon Johnson was not the center of attention, he simply did not care to participate.<br />Yet, he had a person magnetism that drew people to him and inspired loyalty in those he humiliated and drove relentlessly. He was an interesting person and I look forward to reading further volumes of Caro's biography. I would just never want the man in my life.just never want the man in my life.	2003-01-06
US	52402330	R3TVRBQXTXTVIA	0812565959	882430933	Shadow of the Hegemon (The Shadow Series)	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Not Card's best, but enjoyable	Shadow of the Hegemon is the sequel to Ender's Shadow and takes place a year after the events described in Ender's Game / Ender's Shadow . Like in Ender's Shadow the protagonist is Bean, formerly a member of the Battle School and a hero of the Formic War under the leadership of Ender Wiggin.<br />The elite children of the world are sent to the Battle School to combat the threat of the Buggers. With that threat met and the war ended, the school was disbanded and the children sent home. Now, nine of the children are kidnapped and an attempt was made on Bean's life. Bean has to go into hiding. He believes and old rival is behind all of this. The Battle School children are valuable as military strategists and the stability of the world is beginning to evaporate.<br />With the publication of Ender's Game so many years ago, Orson Scott Card has created a possible future for our planet that is stunning in the intensity of what is done to children to ensure survival. The original Quartet followed Ender Wiggin. The new series (the Shadow series) is following Bean, the smallest and smartest of them all. Bean has always been in the shadows, though. In the shadow of Ender Wiggin, and in the shadow of Ender's brother, Peter, who will become ruler (Hegemon) of the world (we learn of this in Card's second novel Speaker for the Dead , published in the mid 80's). While some events may be implausible, they are believable within the confines of Card's created world. This novel can stand alone and works well on its own, but is much more enjoyable as part of the larger series.	2003-01-06

I was a pretty young kid at the time, less than 10 years old. Heenan, nicknamed &quot;The Weasel&quot; by the fans, was the manager of most of the heel wrestlers. &quot;Heel&quot; is the wrestling term for a bad guy. I never liked the guy, but he was always entertaining. For a wrestler to align himself with Heenan it would instantly turn him into a heel as well. Heenan was that effective in his role as the Heel Manager.<br />All wrestling biographies will inevitably be compared to that of Mick Foley's Have a Nice Day . The comparison will be in how truthful the biography is, how much detail it goes into, and how entertaining it is to read. Mick &quot;Mankind&quot; Foley set the bar high. Heenan's book is an entertaining and quick read. It appears to be truthful, breaking kayfabe (wrestling term for protecting the secrets of the business). While reviewers of Hulk Hogan's book take him to task for inaccurate detail, i have not seen any of the same problems with Heenan's book. However, Bobby Heenan does not go into much detail at all. For a biography of a wrestling legend (40 years in the business) to be less than 200 pages, so much seems to be left out.<br />As a wrestling fan, it was nice to get a glimpse of a man i knew next to nothing about. That was all it was, though, a glimpse. It left me wanting to know more	2002-12-30
US	52402330	R17A95ROKFOJWR	0156004801	475362106	All the King's Men	Books	4	9	10	N	N	well worth the time it took me to read this book	All the King's Men was first published in 1946 to immense critical acclaim. The Washington Post made a comment about the novel and how if the idea of naming the Great American Novel is still being tossed around in 50 years (or, now), All the King's Men would certainly be a finalist. The novel won the highest literary prize in America, the Pulitzer Prize.<br />The novel is set in the 1930's and follows the political career of Willie Stark, a provincial man with ambition tempered by honesty and integrity. He begins with integrity, but we see how the power he gains corrupts the man he used to be. His fictional career mirrors (in some ways) the real life career of \\"Kingfish\\" Huey Long (Louisiana). The story is told through the eyes of Jack Burden, a reporter who eventually ends up working for Willie Stark. Burden tells his own story at the same time as he is revealing the life of Willie Stark. The reader only gets to see what Burden shows us. The novel is told with a first person narrative.<br />As would be expected with a Pulitzer Prize winning novel, the writing is quite exceptional. It was a little bit slow going at first, but about halfway through, i had a thought: \\"Damn, this is a good book.\\"	2002-12-24
US	52402330	R37W3NHWEKDTWY	0345326784	135193520	The Deryni Archives	Books	4	6	7	N	N	a nice treat	Fantasy worlds seem ripe for short story collections.  An author may not want to visit favorite characters for a brand new book and many authors refuse to publish books during the historical times mentioned in their novels.  For a reader and a fan, it would be a fun and entertaining experience to revist old friends like that and learn more about how things came about in our favorite worlds.  Happily, Katherine Kurtz published the Deryni Archives, a collection of short fiction set in her Deryni universe.<br />The Deryni series has left many unanswered questions about the history of the Deryni race, The Camberian Council,  as well as Camber's children (and grandchildren).  I would like to know more about them.  This book does revist both major and minor moments in the history of the the Eleven Kingdoms and i have no complaints with the book.  I just want more!<br />The stories contained in this book are short treats.  We see some of the kinder moments that would have no place in a full novel, are nice glimpses into the lives of the characters.  We see how a Deryni bishop is ordained.<br />I can only hope that Katherine Kurtz will release another set of Archives (not Deryni Tales, i mean more stories actually written by Kurtz).	2002-11-01
US	52402330	R1CN8CW41PTZNB	0345384784	529925701	King Javan's Year (Heirs of Saint Chamber)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	my favorite of all the deryni novels	I believe this was the first of the Deryni novels that i read, so perhaps my fondness for the book stems from that.  I knew nothing about the Deryni, the history of the Eleven Kingdoms, or the Regency; but this world drew me in and kept me there.<br />If you have read any of the Deryni novels and have looked at the Haldane lineage, you know how long Javan lived and served as king.  From the title &quot;King Javan's Year&quot;, you have an idea what is going to happen.<br />In so many fantasy novels, the main characters are treated lightly and make it through and they save the day.  In the Deryni novels, things are much darker for the protagonists and what surprised me was how vicious things were against Javan.  Through all of this darkness, the light of who Javan is shines through and I really cared what happened to him and was somewhat upset at how this ended...<br />I suppose that is the mark of a good writer, that you can be drawn into the the world and care about the characters.  The characters i care the most about, though, are those who are earliest in the timeline (Joram, Evaine, Camber, Javan, etc)...i really hope Katherine Kurtz returns to the earlier times of the Eleven Kingdoms.  Until that day, i will continue to read about Camber and his children.	2002-10-28
US	52402330	R3BL4S15KGD7FW	0312277032	717819417	Rainlight	Books	5	17	18	N	N	One of my new favorite books	I read an average of 10 to 20 books a month.  While most of these books are good and a few of them may be very fine novels, very few of them make me excited about an author and about the novel.  Rainlight is such a book.  The writing is incredible, not just for a first novel, but for any novel.  While the multi-narrator format has been in use since at least William Faulkner, Alison McGhee makes it feel fresh and insightful.<br />The story is fast paced and while the novel is emotionally charged by the many viewpoints of the characters, this is such a well told story.  This book really is that good.  This is a somewhat difficult review to write because it is hard not to gush about this book...and i don't gush very often.  This is worth your time and money.	2002-10-17
US	52402330	R35GJNPVR070NW	0449911659	437546793	Rabbit, Run	Books	3	10	14	N	N	I have a problem with Updike	I have to make a confession up front.  I'm not a big fan of John Updike.  I've read the first two Rabbit books, and I'm not impressed.  The writing is excellent.  The prose is fine and moves the story along.  I don't mind an unsympathetic protagonist, i really don't.  There is just something in the character of Harry Angstrom that made me dislike the book...<br />Perhaps there is greatness in this book.  I wouldn't doubt it.  I didn't find it, though.  It has been said that people have two choices.  1. To act.  2. To not act.  Even through inaction, people are making a choice, setting themselves down a specific path from which they refuse to leave.  This is what Rabbit Angstrom does.  His crime is not that he is a bad person, his crime is that his inaction and personal irresponsibility causes more harm than if he intentionally set out to hurt.<br />This novel is an excellent character study.  It examines motives and truths about Harry Angstrom as Rabbit acts, thinks, doesn't think, and doesn't act.  Rabbit, Run works as a character study novel.  It is an extremely well crafted one at that.<br />One more thing: All the technical craft in the world can't make a person like a book.  Rabbit, Run is a book i felt i should read.  So i did.  It is also a book i have no intention of reading again.	2001-02-23
US	52402330	R2BUTHMKZ1RMUS	0449907481	785795777	A Thousand Acres (Ballantine Reader's Circle)	Books	5	1	3	N	N	it did win the pulitzer	I don't feel qualified to write a review of this book.  It won the Pulitzer Prize.  That is a bit daunting to consider.  The book was excellent, well crafted, and moving.  It is a feminist/agrarian reading of King Lear.  A Thousand Acres is also more than that.  It is an attack on farming and of the relations between the sexes.  For all of the technical greatness of the book, it is not without flaws.<br />One flaw is the ending.  Without giving anything away about what happens, the ending is too neat.  In a stunning ending (stunning in the events leading up the conclusion), Jane Smiley cheats reality by having everything tie up neatly for one of the primary characters.  Granted, this is fiction, but considering how well Smiley crafted this novel, i was left feeling cheated by the conclusion.<br />All in all, it is a great novel.  In the declining tradition of agrarian literature, A Thousand Acres is a return to this tradition.  It just happens to be an unfair indictment of the farm tradition.  We have to remember one thing: all farm life is not like this novel.  Smiley got a lot of things right, but not everything.	2001-02-23

I'm a guy, so i don't get the humor of Bridget Jones's Diary.  The book is not funny.  I found it quite tedious and i often wanted somebody to boot Bridget in the head.  I did sympathize with the character at times.  Quite a few times to be perfectly honest.  Reading this book, i found myself waiting for a payoff that never came.  I finish one chapter and think, &quot;How dull.&quot;  I finish another, &quot;How dreary.&quot;  I finish the book, &quot;How tedious...and i'll never get that time back.&quot;  That's when i know i got nothing out of a book, when i realize that i've just wasted whatever amount of time i spent reading it.  With all of the hype surrounding this book, i just feel let down and betrayed.  It just wasn't interesting.	2001-02-23
US	52402330	R2ZHIJJ0U1HEZ8	074320395X	785819131	The Body Artist: A Novel	Books	3	1	3	N	N	Not Quite Vintage DeLillo	The book jacket to this novel has one thing right, it is spare.  I'm just not sure if it is seductive, like the jacket also suggests.  The Body Artist is very DeLillo.  How the sentences are constructed, how paragraphs flow, DeLillo gives off a sense of himself as a writer.  Yet, for all DeLillo's greatness as a writer, something is missing in this novel.  Some say plot is missing, but that is not fair.  DeLillo does not use plot in the conventional sense.  If one looks for a conventional plot in Underworld, it isn't there.  On page 65, DeLillo both describes part of a truth about postmodern literature, and also what seems to be ailing this novel:<br />&quot;There is a code in the simplist conversation that tells the speakers what's going on outside the bare acoustics.  This was missing when they talked.  There was a missing beat.  It was hard for her to find the tempo.  All they had were unadjusted words.  She lost touch with him, lost interest sometimes, couldn't locate rhythmic intervals or time cues or even the mutters and hums, the audible pauses that pace a remark....all this was missing here&quot; (65-66).<br />Despite this absence, I look forward to anything DeLillo writes in the future.  When the man is on top of his game, his novels work and draw the reader in to a whole new world.  Sadly, in the Body Artist, the reader is left wondering where the world is, and what happened.	2001-02-18

I heard about it months before it's release and the topic intrigued me.  As a 21 year old male, reading this  book was an interesting experience.  I'm growing up in a culture that  states that sex and promiscuity is the norm and the way things should be.  Anything else is viewed as abberation and repressive.  Yet, reading Shalit,  i found myself compelled (to an extent) by her arguments that it is this  same sexual revolution that has destroyed respect for women.  Listening to  the locker room type talk, it is disgusting to hear what guys want to do,  have done (or say they have), or are planning for their next conquest.  Ms.  Shalit writes from a slightly Jewish perspective, but anybody reading it  can understand her points and can see that there are some very valid points  that she makes about the status of women in society and how they got there.  In the past, even with all of the inequality for women (bad thing), there  was still a level of respect for women.  Today, the inequality is less, but  the respect has dissipated.  Shalit offers an insightful commentary on the  sexual revolution, and even if the reader disagrees, there is food for  thought.	2000-04-19
