I had hoped for ideas for pretty shadow boxes (e.g., kitchen, wedding, new baby, graduate).  Instead, these projects look as though they were done by a small child, and I'd be very ashamed to have them on display in my basement.  They also all look very cheap.  Amazon is filled with wonderful books on making very cheap, easy projects that look awesome.  So this one was a total waste of money; I certainly don't want to know how to make cheap garbage that looks like cheap garbage made a small child. Likewise, I've ordered numerous excellent books that help me craft wonderful memory projects and gifts.  Don't waste your money on this one.  It really stinks.  To be fair, a child would probably love it, and it would probably be great for a kid.  But I can't imagine an adult not being very ashamed to make any of these projects, much less to display them or give them as gifts.  YUCK!	2002-10-13

Although the book mentions sources for Lyle's Golden Syrup (required in a number of recipes), it does not state that light corn syrup (e.g., readily available Karo) is a standard substitute -- and I know for a fact that it works fine in at least some of the recipes, because I've used it.  The recipe selection seems eclectic and interesting until you notice how vague the directions are (which doesn't bother me since I'm an experienced cook, but is hardly appropriate in a book \\"for dummies\\".

It seems centered on the unfairness of trials and the brutality of prisons -- which would be laudable in a non-fiction book designed to pinpoint/improve such areas, but was wholly inappropriate in a MYSTERY NOVEL.  Throughout most of the book, the main character constantly whined about her evil daddy and how unfairly he treated her.  After that, we moved on to the unfairness of trials and the unbelievable brutality of prisons.  I was seeking a mystery, not a treatise on prison brutality.  This was loathesome.  To put it very, very mildly, it was a complete waste of money and time.	2002-09-06

This book is equally wonderful.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it doesn't give any hint where to buy any of the materials -- which sure aren't available anywhere near me.  Likewise, some of her descriptions are very skimpy if you're going to have to search for the item(s).  Nevertheless, the gorgeous photographs and clear directives make this well worth the purchase price.  Although I'm not sure what a Japanese lantern is (and even the many-paged instructions didn't make that clear), the variety is extensive (from sachets to lampshades, boxes, picture frames, picture mats, cards, and a zillion things in between), and everything shown is gorgeous.	2002-07-02

Although there are some beautiful photos here, you can find similarly beautiful photos in &quot;Architectural Digest&quot;, &quot;Home and Garden&quot;, etc.  What ticked me off was that it would mention something enticing (like canvas inserts), but say only to request them from your photographer. For those of us who like (or have!) to do it ourselves, it wouldn't have taken much space or time to very briefly explain what that is (it is like a very plush canvas-covered matboard), where to buy it (most framers, or online), how to use it (as you would matboard), available colors (I've only seen ivory and black).  Likewise, a few framing tips would have been a very nice idea, rather than just saying &quot;go to a good framer&quot;, like each reader has tons of money for this.  It could have been a wonderful book if the authors had only been a teensy bit less greedy, and tried to help readers from all walks of life, rather than just the super-rich.	2002-07-02

I *LOVE* this book!  It gives explicit, step-by-step directions to repair/enhance all types of finds, from picture frames to caned chairs ... e.g., how to do the caning, how to enhance simple frames or repair fancy ones, all kinds of ways to treat wood, and zillions of other things for just about anything you might find at a garage sale.  Although many are of no interest to me, I would have happily bought it for the framing and finishing sections alone -- and the book just arrived, so I haven't begun to see what else is included.  My only complaint is that there should have been photos of finished items so we'd know what we're striving toward (and, given the hefty pricetag for a paperback, that doesn't seem unreasonable) ... At the very least, there should have been a diagram for each and every project.  (There are color photos, but perilously few, and all but one was of no remote interest to me.)  Nevertheless, the wealth of information makes this a true bargain, and I sure love mine!  This would make a great gift for anyone who frequents garage sales, is on a tight budget, bought (or is thinking of buying) a fixer-upper, and/or is a do-it-yourselfer.  Even if you don't go to garage sales, this will show you what to do with junk from your basement or your parents' attic, etc.	2002-05-14

Unfortunately, however, it was a huge disappointment, and is going back.  The photos are beautiful but a person buying a lighthouse calendar wants to see the lighthouses, rather than a lot of grass with a distant bitsy lighthouse in the center (which is odd, in itself, since the lighthouses I've visited are all coastal).

IMHO, you'd be much better served with Charlotte Lyons's Mothers and Daughters crafting book, which WAS meant for mothers to make with their daughters (but would be just as appropriate for fathers and daughters, mothers and sons, grandparents and grandchildren, etc.).

Having seen the author on Martha Stewart's program, and reading the hype that it was comparable to the wonderful Barefoot Contessa cookbooks, I couldn't wait to order it -- but am disgustedly sending it back.  What a ...!  Look in the index under either Jellies or Seven Pepper Jelly, and you'll be directed to a certain page -- which recommends buying your Seven Pepper Jelly from Foster's Market.  That left a really bad taste in my mouth.  I can reluctantly understand their not imparting secrets (although I thought that was why people wanted their ultra-high-priced cookbook)-- but surely she could have called for a hot, mild, or medium pepper jelly, and stated in parenthesis that she uses the one she sells by the name of Seven Pepper Jelly.  Her blatant advertising really turned me off.<br />Even at today's prices, this is a very, very expensive cookbook.  I expected (and deserved) more than an advertisement for her mail order products.  Other successful bakery/mail order owners have written wonderful cookbooks (Margaret Fox, Ina Garten, Nancy-from-that-renowned-bakery-that-makes-the-awesome-<BR>bread-from-a-grapeseed-starter, etc.) but used them to proudly share their finest recipes, rather than as another ad to order their products.  IMHO, Ms. Foster's tactics are disgraceful -- if she wanted to write a book about what to buy from her, that would be fine, but it should have had a title and description that reflected its purpose, not implied that it was filled with her signature dishes.

Their books are written with incredible warmth, and introduce each recipe so you'll know what to expect, and why it is special to them.  Although Cleora Butler appears to have been a singularly gifted and accomplished cook, I didn't get the &quot;warm fuzzies&quot; derived from other African American authors.  I had bought the hardcover edition, but ended up giving it away ... as a Northeastern WASP<BR>who knew little about either African American or southern cooking, I really missed not having warm intros or descriptions of the recipes.

The recipes are varied and designed to appeal to omnivores and reluctant vegetarians -- and thus perfect for entertaining.  (They're also very clearly written.)  The author explains that she has been a vegetarian for over 30 years, and in 1971 married a meat-and-potatoes man who hasn't changed his menu preferences, but is a strict vegetarian -- i.e., who eats the type of recipes in this book, which were designed to appeal to omnivores.  They're appealing and varied enough to appeal to darned near everyone.  My one and only complaint (and the reason I gave it only 4 stars) is that it mentions that some brands are better than others, but gives no hint as to which the author prefers -- which means that *I* will have to try umpteen brands to find which one(s) work in a particular recipe, when the author could easily have provided a starting point, at least giving ideas of what to look for &lt;sigh&gt;.

The directions are clear and explicit, covering virtually every aspect of this exquisite art.<br />In addition to all the basic essentials of illuminated calligraphy (including in depth descriptions and directions for gilding), this even includes explicit directions for coats of arms and similar heraldry -- which is very often an important part of illuminated calligraphy, but which I've never before seen addressed in print, much less with such detailed descriptions and explicit directions.  (It not only relates the components of the coat of arms, but what they're based on, how to have one designed and assigned if your family history doesn't include a &quot;legal&quot; one, etc. -- as well as how to decorate this for illuminated calligraphy.)  From how to make essential paint mixtures (color, fish glue, or whatever) to how to make the decorations, this book includes everything.  The pictures are beautiful, the text is priceless, the directions are invaluable, etc. -- for anyone seriously interested in illuminated calligraphy, this book would be worth many times its modest cost -- and, I never expected to describe 29.95 as a &quot;modest cost&quot;, but that really seems to apply to this book when I compare it with other books on the subject.	2002-04-13

Although I'm hardly seeking stark realism, this plot was hopelessly contrived, with everyone visiting an English B&amp;B somehow involved in each other's bedrooms/murders.  Since the main character is black, I was looking forward to a mystery along the lines of John Ball, Eleanor Bland, Chassie West, MK Wren, etc., where the African-American heritage greatly enhanced the plot and setting.  Alas, this character could have been a purple dinosaur for all the references.  The main character is Lizabeth(Lizzie) Stuart, the illegitimate daughter of a black woman who abandoned her after giving birth, and who was raised by her grandparents in Drucilla, Kentucky -- but that's all we ever learn about her background.  Since Lizzie has a PhD, it could have been a great mystery involving a successful black role model -- but no such luck.  The book takes place in England, involving a far-fetched, hopelessly contrived mystery and unfathomable number of &quot;coincidences&quot; at the B&amp;B.

Having read several wonderful mysteries featuring African-Americans, I was really looking forward to this one, based upon the Amazon reviews.  Unfortunately, however, I'll be doing well to get past the filthy, disgusting language and gratuitous sex (gratuitous in the sense of not being essential to the story ... years ago, I loved Irving Wallace's _The Seven Minutes_ because it was a riveting mystery, and sexual references were relevant ... Here, they're just disgusting).  I don't understand why the author needs crude language and dirty sex to write a mystery; the passages to which I am referring are in no way relevant, much less necessary; just disgusting.  The book is also grossly overpriced; who wants to spend [money] for a flimsy paperback - much less one as mediocre as this?  The plot is okay if you don't mind the inflated price, disgusting language, and sexual innuendo -- but, with so many outstanding mysteries available online (even those OOP), why waste time on this garbage?...	2002-04-03

Although the world's worst mathematician (and unable to solve even the simplest math puzzle), I was fascinated by that.  And, as a huge fan of Miss Marple who also loves Emma Lathen's elderly John Thatcher, I was prepared to greatly enjoy this elderly sleuth and setting -- but I didn't.  Although neither expecting nor wanting stark realism in mysteries, and fully prepared to suspend disbelief (as a child, I loved fairy tales, Bewitched, and I Dream of Jeannie), even I found the plot hopelessly and unbelievably convoluted.  But if you're not expecting another Agatha Christie or Emma Lathen, and want a light, simple read, you'll probably enjoy it greatly ... the math puzzles, alone, make it a worthwhile, intriguing read.  I'm probably grading it too harshly because of my passion for Christie and Lathen ... Hopefully, this is the first book in a series, and its successors will have more believable solutions.	2002-04-03

Had it contained directions for making the projects, and/or information on where to buy them, I would have loved it.

It is a flimsy pocket book sized paperback (i.e., more like a mystery or romance novel), written as a hodgepodge of ideas/tips/sentiments, with 1-3 short blurbs on each page -- and no rhyme or reason to the sequence.  (The concept might have worked very well had the author taken the time to marshal her thoughts, rather than flitting from subject to subject w/o really acknowledging any of them.)  I resented reading about how much she loves making and serving glogg, snickerdoodles, etc., with no hint of her recipes.  People who don't own Susan Branch's Christmas cookbook won't be too thrilled to learn that the waffles and pots de creme from there are a staple in the author's home, but at least I can look those up.  I still might have liked the book if it had provided more information/details, such as the actual letter that appeared in the &quot;Sun&quot; (&quot;Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus&quot;) -- but, just mentioning it in a sentence seemed like little more than a waste of time.  The whole book was in that context -- just short, fleeting references, usually a short sentence or two long (yet comprising an entire page), and barely describing anything sufficiently to make it meaningful.  Don't waste your money.	2002-03-11

I have Frieda Knight's wonderful _Dinner with a Dish_ (from Ebony), so really looked forward to this one.  But it was so coldly written, with no introductions, anecdotes, or descriptions of the recipes. In the aforementioned _Dinner with a Dish_, it tells how a minted pea recipe became very popular after someone mistakenly used mint tea instead of water to cook some peas.  I like that sort of intro/description, and missed it here.  For example, all recipe collections include some that are quick-and-easy, some that use up ingredients we keep on hand, some that are very cheap, some that are out-of-this-world delicious show-stoppers, some that have sentimental value, etc. -- and it is important to know which are which before wasting your time and effort.  (For example, I'm a northerner, and have never seen or tasted collard greens.  A recipe describing them as delectable would tempt me to locate and try them -- but, without such a description, I have no way of knowing if the recipe is listed because collard greens are readily available, or because they taste good.)  is book doesn't provide any clues about time or effort involved or results expected.  I was horribly disappointed, and will be returning it.<br />However, I gave it three stars rather than one, since the above criteria may not matter to all people.	2002-03-05

It is a beautiful book, with numerous colored photos, and anecdotes preceding each recipe (each in a different colored text, adding great visual appeal).  And some of my all-time favorite and best recipes come from this book -- the strawberry meringue torte (the world's best dacquoise), pecan roll (I usually use toasted filberts), Spanish omelet, ratatouille (better than any other I've tried), broiled stuffed tomatoes, etc.  The only caveat is that the author is a professional chef (former chef to Jacqueline Kennedy), so she's not always nit-picking about absolute precision in recipes.  Although the baked goods seem fail-safe, I had to double the amount of lentils to get a thick lentil soup.  This book is as good for reading (e.g., what the Kennedy children enjoyed from her kitchen, Billy Rose's favorite cheesecake, how the German-born author discovered that even Americans who hate turkey demand it for Thanksgiving, etc.) as for cooking.  When it was in print, I gave copies to almost all of my friends; now that it is available used on Amazon, I will have to see who missed out.  Everyone, without fail, has loved this book.  If you like to cook or read about cooking, this book is definitely for you.	2002-02-17

But, even then, she was an extraordinary cook, and the recipes I've tried have been unfailingly delicious.

It is a hardcover book in the shape of an octagon; each sailor's valentine consumes a full page (so that both sides of a hinged valentine face each other, as they would in the actual valentine), so you can really see how the valentine looks.  It would make a unique and gorgeous coffee table book.  It would also be indispensable if you want to learn to make your own sailors' valentines, since it provide general directions, a list of the shells traditionally used, and gorgeous color photos of an unbelievable number of actual sailors' valentines.

It is very strange.  From the description, I had expected a book relating the legends and folklore about different beads.  (By way of example, the first time I spoke publicly to a large group, a colleague insisted that I carry her special bead with me for good luck, and would not accept my refusals.  So, I carried it, and I did great.)  And, regardless of whether or not most of us believe them, many beads are believed to have certain powers/attributes, and it can be nice to attach cards with this information along with gifts we've made from beads, etc.  But this book was all about the author's personal feelings about beads, rather than legends/folklore.  She includes directions for a spirit doll, but says only why she, herself, likes it -- i.e., no information about the history of such a doll, how it became popular in other countries, or whatever.  I would have loved that had it been like a Guatemalan worry doll, but this offered nothing to make a gift more special -- or a bead, for that matter.<br />The author seems very sincere, and I was very sorry that I didn't like her book, but I really didn't.  I just couldn't find anything in it that held any interest for me.  The whole book seemed weird.	2002-01-28

But what a letdown!  To call if flimsy (VERY flimsy) would be putting it VERY tactfully, and it was typed on a plain ole typewriter, and comb-bound with the kind of machine found in almost all offices and many homes.  Even that would have been okay had the book been good, but it wasn't.  Most of the recipes lack measurements (eg, vanilla, but no hint how much to use, or how the dish should taste - subtle or spicy).  And none contain any descriptions, or hints about why it was Mama's specialty, how or when Mama served it, or anything like that.  NOTHING.  Just a few scant vague recipes w/o descriptions or measurements, some blurry black and white photos of Mama and her girls, and a hefty price tag for such a weak collection so poorly presented.<br />Spoonbread and Strawberry Wine is one of my all-time favorite cookbooks, and I would have been thrilled with this had it merely described the recipes the way Spoonbread did - but this book gave no hint why a recipe might be special, or how it should taste.  I also wouldn't have cared about the cheapy presentation and plain ole typewriter production had the recipes been worthwhile (after all, that's what I was buying), but they weren't.  <br />This was flimsy, cheapy, and a complete waste of money.

It contains a wide variety of soup mixes and directions to use them for soup-making.  It also contains 6 recipe tags to give with each jar of soup mix showing how to add such-and-such to the mix to make the soup. (Although not necessary -- and quite useless if you modify the recipes to suit your tastes or those of the recipients -- it is nonetheless an nice touch.)  The first page says that each mix should keep for up to 6 months (3 months if they contain nuts - but how many soup mixes do?), and gives suggestions for packaging them.  My only quibbles are minor ... It could have mentioned vegetarian alternatives (e.g., vegetarian beef or chicken-flavored broth mixes) to make these for vegetarian friends -- and it should have<BR>mentioned the weight of the ingredients so you'd know what size package to look for, rather than either buying extra or standing in the supermarket trying to figure out how much would yield X cups.  It would also have been nice to include a few ways to dress up the gift (e.g., putting it in a basket with such-and-such, accompanying it with such-and-such, or whatever).

Despite its modest price, it contains more tempting recipes and packaging ideas than many books many times costing far more.  Having always lived in the northeast, I was a little dubious about the southwestern subject for fear it would be filled with ingredients unavailable here -- but I only noticed one containing an ingredient I'm unlikely to locate (prickly pear jelly).  All of the recipes appear to be tried-and-true, with descriptions of why they're special (from candies the authors dare not make ahead of time because they'll get eaten to chili powder mix suggesting a drop of sugar to round out the flavors, although that isn't essential).  There are many mixes (from soups to enchilada sauce)and gifts in jars (including sand art), as well as more commone ones.  Each contains excellent packaging ideas, often with a unique southwestern touch -- and there are even directions for making cornhusk wreaths.

Each recipe is prefaced by a description of the recipe, how to serve it, etc., and the directions are exceptionally clear.  I'm thoroughly delighted with my purchase.  The price is very modest; personally, I would have paid much more for such a tried-and-true collection of recipes that are almost impossible to locate -- and I, myself, would much prefer a book comprised of X tried-and-true well-tested favorites than one with umpteen others just to pad it out and make it look better (so that testing them becomes a culinary version of culinary &quot;Russian Roulette&quot;, with no way of knowing which ones are even edible).  In this book, you know that every recipe was collected, tested, perfected, and loved by the author and her family/friends -- and, to me, that is priceless.  I cannot sufficiently recommend this book; I am really excited about it.	2001-11-02

It is very warmly and lovingly written about an extraordinary southern black cook/nanny who changed the lives of the family she served.  I wanted to cry when I read of Annie's impoverished childhood, having to work instead of going to school (even as a little girl), getting up at 4 AM from the time she was 10 years old in order to fix breakfast so everyone could get to the fields, etc.  But she retained a positive attitude and deep faith (which is very humbling).  Although I have not yet had a chance to try the recipes, they look wonderful, and many are prefaced by descriptions of why they are so special / taste so good ... down home southern cooking at its very finest.  However, IMHO, the book would have been priceless if only for the warm, glowing descriptions of Annie, and recollections in her own words.	2001-10-31

I love this book, both for myself, and to give as gifts.  It is every warmly written, and contains wonderful, easy-to-follow recipes.  My favorite so far is the macaroni and cheese -- and a Weight Watchers friend who has also tried it says that it is easily adapted to low-fat/no-fat ingredients, and is still delicious.  A real favorite; I can't imagine anyone not loving this book.	2001-10-31

Although initially intrigued by the &quot;legends&quot;, those I checked looked stupid to me ... e.g., about how a pansy's petals tell the story of how a wicked queen mistreats her stepdaughters, with no positive (much less fairytale) ending, nothing remotely uplifting, no moral, etc.  DEFINITELY not the type of thing you'd print to give with a pressed flower pansy, or other form of the flower.  The recipes are equally impractical, since few people use suet in desserts these days.<BR>And all the stories in the voice of the mythical Mrs. Sharp just seemed stupid and contrived.  Although the premise was excellent, the book just didn't follow through.	2001-10-26

But what a disappointment!  The recipes are short and vague -- which is fine if you just want to peruse them, but spells disaster if you want to actually make them.  For example, the recipe for snow globes doesn't explain that you need a silicone adhesive to prevent the water from dissolving the glue, and that you need non-metallic glitter so it won't rust.  The author should have perfected her recipes before rushing to press.<BR>Had she taken the time to see how they lasted, and made sure that her directions were very clear, it would have been wonderful.  What a disappointment!	2001-10-18

Since this book just arrived, it seems somewhat premature to be reviewing it already -- but it has already proven well worth the cost.  I absolutely love the gift-giving chapter, filled with incomparable ideas for giving wonderful gifts from the heart that only a Scrooge wouldn't love, but that won't break the bank.<BR>Same with wonderful ideas for holiday traditions, decorations, etc.  Although I have not yet had a chance to try them, the recipes for making your own mixes (both practical and suitable for gift-giving), cleansers, etc. seem especially good.  I havn't even gotten to the chapters on saving money and cutting costs yet, but am already thrilled with my purchase.  I love it!	2001-10-18
US	41681994	RDWAGVJ1CFGUK	051716213X	35781116	Pennsylvania Dutch Cooking: A Mennonite Community Cookbook	Books	2	23	24	N	N	Reprint of earlier book but NOT so marked!	This book is a reprint of the authors' _Mennonite Community Cookbook_ ... Every single page is identical, word for word (just a different cover, title, and typeface) - which to me constitutes gross misrepresentation since I couldn't find that mentioned anywhere in the book, and I obviously wouldn't knowingly have ordered a duplicate copy.  However, if you don't have the earlier book, you will love it.  (The reason I ordered it was because I like the original book so much, and was therefore eager to see a seemingly new title attributed to them.)<BR>It is a compilation of recipes culled from Mennonites.  Since the original book was written in 1950, the directions are nowhere near as explicit as they would be today -- and there are very few &quot;warm, fuzzy&quot; notes prefacing recipes, so you can't tell if something was included because it is quick and easy, cheap, uses readily available ingreadients (which may be expensive today and hard for you to locate) or because it is incredibly delicious.  But the gems in the collection make it well worth owning, and I love the book.  My one and only complaint is that this edition is not marked as a reprint of the original.  Once again, if you don't already own the original, this one is lovely.	2001-10-16

Although I have not yet had a chance to try any of the recipes, I have already decided to give this book as Christmas presents this year.  I LOVE it!  My only quibble is that it is comb-bound<BR>(not ring-bound, as advertised)that the red print is not what I'd call relaxing for the eyes (although it is very bold, and thus easy to read), and that I detest the company the author recommends as a source for essential oils.  But those are comparatively minor complaints, and this is a truly wonderful book, far and away the best I've ever seen on this type of subject. The author provides a wide variety of recipes, and goes into considerable depth about the ingredients, placement, etc. -- including facts I never knew about everything from chocolate chips to baking soda, things I never would have thought of (e.g., why it is important to use a real canning jar if including brown sugar), etc.  Frankly, the book would have been well worth its hefty price just for the information (without the recipes) -- although I'm thrilled to have all these tried-and-true recipes for a wide range of foods, massage oils, etc., ranging from Ethiopian Cottage Cheese to Reindeer Food, layered mixes for soups, cookies, cakes, &amp; drinks, salsas, soaps, foot soaks, leg cramp remedy, flowerpot bread, etc. -- and extraordinary range, each with special little hints to make them fail-safe.  Best money I ever spent!  These will be fantastic for gift-giving, selling at the church fair, and just keeping on hand for convenience.  Wonderful!	2001-10-15

My one and only quibble is that there were no introductions preceding the recipes.  IMHO, those make my other African-American cookbooks unbelievably special and priceless to me.  However, to be fair, I'm neither southern nor African-American, so probably need the intros more than most people would.  And the descriptions of Tuskeegee are wonderful; this is a lovely book -- it just didn't give me the warm fuzzies I usually get from African-American cookbooks.	2001-10-09
