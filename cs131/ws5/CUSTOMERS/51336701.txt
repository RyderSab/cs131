I just read the last sentence on this most amazing book and I feel it changem me forever - and for better. I're read all the other works by Richard Alan Miller (and the ones by Iona Miller, too), and all that books are very good at least in it's path, to say so. But this book astonished me! I'm a rather complex person, as you can see at my Orkut's profile ([...] Today, I feel the effects of my past experiences upon my life. With my operational background, it seems surprising to some that I'm an occultist, or a magician, if you will. Alt. I'm an author of several books on Magick, I'm still after the \\"Light\\" on several obscure topics, some of them that really haunt me day after day. C'mom, I'm not \\"Average Joe\\", and as such many complex things haunts me and I can not leave them alone. Untill reading this \\"Magnum Opus\\", I must say my understanding of Alchemy was not practical and in no way it can change anything on me. But this book tells it all, shedding Light on the most hermetical teachings, upon the most inner secrets, guarded for centuries from the human race. Richard and Iona Miller's book s the first one to show is everything about such secrets as Baphomet and it's message (Solve & Coagula), the Dragon, the Wolf and the Dog, the Prima Materia and Materia Prima, the Nigredo, the Solutio, Coagulatio, Sublimatio, Albedo, Rubedo, Coniunctio, Solificatio, Puer & Senex, the Devouring Father, Anima & Animus, the Ultima Materia, Archetypes, the Holly Guardian Angel, the reality about the Philosopher's Stone, the origins of The Book of Lambsprinck, plus the occult side of  depression, phobias, anxiety and other modern \\"demons\\", besides the profiles of great Alchemy Masters of yesterday. Joel Radcliffe's alchemical illustrations are superb, and worth the book's price alone. I must congratulate the authors and publishers for this magnificent work. This is a must for any occultist's bookshelf. It is pure gold in book format.t.	2005-05-12

I'm one of the four co-authors of this book, and I want to tell you all something about it, and about me, too. I'm experienced in real combat, and I have done years of overseas \\"contractor\\" work... I've been in five major guerrilla wars (Angola, Mozambique, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Lebanon), and alt. I had previous experience with all kinds of land-warfare weapons, several times I had to place my life over the sharped edge of a blade to survive - and it worked. A knife never jams, never gets out of ammo, and can even be one of several common items at hand one can found at any place. I really hope you readers out there like our book, because it is a work of love, done with the utmost care, targeted to help fellow citizens who must fight for life against crime and violence. We really do not looked for earning money with it as our main nor first goal. Fellow Brazilians are so stricken by poverty that a common fighting knife here is a US$ 2.00 one - and more people are killed with these \\"El Cheapo\\" tools every day than with all the M-16's, AK's, and any other firearm we can remember of. Brazil is today's most dangerous place to live, or even to visit, in all the World. Let me tell you why, with official data - data from the U.S. Gov't, from Brazilian Gov't, and from the ONU. Let's place aside the fact that Brazil's the biggest executive cars armorer in the World... we armor more than all other Nations do along, each and every year... Now, USA State Dept. say to Americans to did not come here. THEY ARE RIGHT!!! Think of this: On the Gaza strip, on the Middle-East, between 1987-2003, 450-some people died violently; on a 15 miles strip of land among a touristic beach in Rio de Janeiro and the international airport there, over the same '87-'03, 9.800-some people're murdered!!! On the Angolan Civil War, that erupted really on 1980, among 1980-2000, there're 350.000 violent deaths; in Rio de Janeiro City, over the same time, 650.000-some people're killed, murdered, executed...!!! Each year, 60.000-65.000-some common citizens are killed/murdered/executed in Brazil, 20% on my Town, São Paulo, 15% on Rio de Janeiro (some 300 miles from here), the rest on all the Country... more than all the Americans killed in all the years of the Viet-Nam War... but here in just one year... and this is every year... Prison cells, here, in a space of 10 feet x 10 feet, keep 30 men behind rusting iron bars!!! That is, one come inside a criminal, goes outside a monster, AIDS-striken (imagine 30 Brazilian criminals, that can not read a line, without a tooth in the mouth, addicted to crack, what they do for fun?) YES!!! And so and so... Once imprisoned here, one's \\"initiated\\" (raped) by all his \\"colegues\\"... if there is a Hell, it can not be far from here. And you Americans think America is bad enough, uh? Well, enough on my Mother Land. I realy hope this book can be a close friend to it's readers and, if just one life can be saved by it's teachings, we, the authors, can die, when our time came, as better men. Look at a retired Brazilian Navy Military Commander testimonial at [...] - But, now, an update: there is an ongoing plan to difamate us in public view by telling our book is a copy of another, or that we are a fake, etc. I ask any person to look at the site above to see some PROOF of our teachings, capabilities, and work.

On this amazing volume, you'll find the most fascinating book on the subject that, really, tells it all.

But be sure you'll need a complete small shop at least to make even a single-shot falling-block pistol or rifle. No place for amateurs there. But there are times when \\"Average Joe\\" need combat weapons to survive in bad times. I have seen it before.

I'm a licensed guns collector, and my full-auto weapons're my game. My machine gun collection is my jewel, ranging from .50's twins to .22 RF improvisations, and they are a lot fun to play with. But I \\"play\\" with ball ammo, only really good to shot at paper and little else. I'm a former special-operations officer with 16 years of service in my country's intelligence agency (something like a \\"mix\\" of  CIA/FBI/Secret Service, now defunct), and I have done years of overseas \\"contractor\\" work... I've been in five major guerrilla wars (Angola, Mozambique, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Lebanon), and I have shot anything that is handheld, from small mortars to stingers. And the most awesome weapon I faced ever, as I can remember, was a small Sovietic/Russian pocket pistol called \\"PSM\\" in a feeble caliber (5.45x17mm), something like a bottlenecked .380 ACP to accept a smaller than a .22 (5.56mm) slug. But the slug was the freezing thing about it: small, light, and ARMOR-PIERCING, capable of rendering a Level III-A Body Armor a Swiss-cheese... And what startled me was the fact that so a small gun could place holes in a US$ 2.000 vest! After facing this gun (fortunatelly I was wearing a hard-armor in Level IV that day), I start to think on how important is the knowledge to roll AP slugs. Today, even here in Latin America, bad guys wear armored vests, and any belt gun can not defeat any armored foe. With a light Level II vest, not even a 12-gauge buckshot can penetrate. But, with the valious knowledge found on this little book, you can make your own AP slugs. My advise is to have a full magazine mixed, that is, first a pair of real manstoper (Glaser, MagSafe, HydraShock), them a couple of AP's (I'll use solid copper SWC ones, maybe a THV or \\"drop\\" design, if the ranges are urban-type), and a mix of one of each, ending with 3 \\"Tracers\\", being a Green, an Orange or Yellow, and a Red, the last one. Why? I can tell by my own experience that it is very hard to \\"count\\" the firing shots in a gunfight. The idea is: you see a GREEN fire, you have just two shots, time to think on reloading... you see an YELLOW (or ORANGE) fire, better have a fresh magazine on hand, just one shot left, time to reload... you see a RED fire, it was the last from the old magazine and, if you do things right, a new round is chambered. This book is an important one to any handloader, to any gun-buff, to anyone who takes guns & ammo as serious lifesaving tools.maybe a THV or \\"drop\\" design, if the ranges are urban-type), and a mix of one of each, ending with 3 \\"Tracers\\", being a Green, an Orange or Yellow, and a Red, the last one.

This is the one and only work that really &quot;translated&quot; the Zen-Archery concepts of &quot;becoming the arrow&quot; or &quot;becoming one with the bow&quot; to the Western mind. I love Archery, and this book openned up new views on how to &quot;reach out and touch someone&quot; longer, faster, and with more precision than I ever think it was possible in Archery.	2001-01-15

This is the best work ever done, under one single cover, on the subject. For all the people that goes to the wilderness (hunters, fishers,  backpackers, outdoorsmen), this book is a muust-have. For the people that  want to really know the evolution of technology from the early, say  &quot;stone-age&quot;, standpoint, it's a fascinating work. Specially good  the chapter on primitive weapons, with some of the best instructions on the  atlatl (spear-thrower or, more preciselly, dart-thrower), the weapon that  men of yore used to hunt big game in the stone-age days. I loved it, and I  know you'll love it, too.	2000-08-02

This is the most fascinating book I ever read on Crossbows. Being a collector of Crossbows &amp; other light weapons, a hunter and shooter, I always fell that Crossbows are funny and efficient, trully lethal weapons.  But they are cumbersome, heavy, and almost impossible to build in a  home-workshop. With the historical and practical knowledge gathered thru  this fascinating book, we can create our own advanced Crossbow-type  weapons, much cheaper and as accurate and deadly as the bow-and-string  traditional ones. Using rubber-bands and simple (but trully hi-tech)  solutions to the &quot;problems&quot; of the amazing Crossbow, we find, in  this wonderfull book, a marvelous view of how the good old things can be  changed to become something better, indeed much better! I know you'll love  this book, as much as I love it. I'm a published author, too, and this book  is one I wish I have writen... I love this book so much that I give ten, as  gifts, to friends that like Crossbows, too, and all them loved it. Buy it.  You won't get disapointed, I'm sure.	2000-06-24

This amazing little book tells everything a layman wish to know about one of the most fascinating, efficient, and seldom-know of the weapons of the World: the Blowgun. Blowguns history, construction, and usage; conventional  projectiles making and usage; advanced projectiles making (such as  stun-type, mace-type, target, hunting, broadheaded, incendiary, explosive,  even poisoned ones). A chapter on poisons, but from a modern,  urban-household point-of-view: how to use common products as deadly  poisons; how to prepare true chemical-warfare-type poison from common  inseticides. This book is a must for any weapons buff, collector, hunter,  or survivalist. Afterall, wich makes a good weapon? It must be cheap (so  cheap you can put it into the garbage anytime you want - or need!),  precise, silent, easy-to-use, easy-to-conceal, easy-to-destroy, and, most  of all, deadly. And, the Blowgun is such a weapon! Today, South-American  Indians still kill animals and men alike with theyr primitive Blowguns,  using poisoned-coated darts. No survivalist can skip such a weapon!<br />Professionally, I'm  an attorney, journalist, and published writer of 3 books &amp; 26 booklets.  I have hunted with every conceavable weapon, from British double .577  rifles, to .44 Magnum revolvers; from primitive bows &amp; arrows, to  advanced compound crossbows; from Argentine bolas, to ancient atlatls; and  hear me: hunting with a Blowgun is fascinating!
