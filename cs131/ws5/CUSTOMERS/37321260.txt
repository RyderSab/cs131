I mean, we've got great warriors of the faith like Billy Graham and D. James Kennedy out there with awesome evangelism programs, right? We all lead busy lives, and besides, witnessing is just not our \\"gift,\\" right? And besides that...it's uncomfortable! Right? At best, we can hand out a Four Spiritual Laws tract, right? Right?<br /><br />Okay, maybe that's not you. Perhaps you've done your share of witnessing. Led a friend or two to God's throne, even. But the vast majority of Christians simply don't worry too much about witnessing. Which is wrong. What else are we here for, if not to win souls away from the devil?<br /><br />I hate to make this sound like a commercial, but \\"introducing the solution.\\" Ray Comfort has really done his homework well, and has discerned that the \\"feel-good\\" gospel -- emphasizing only love and grace and forgiveness -- is NOT the way to go. He backs this up with shockingly dismal statistics gathered from follow-up visits to sites where such things as Billy Graham crusades are held. 90 - 90% of people visited were not in the faith. The \\"love and grace\\" gospel confuses people. Accepting Christ for love, forgiveness and a happy life ignores the sinner's sin, which results in backsliders, counterfeits, and false converts. The sincere suddenly find that a Christian's life is not much better, and leaves the faith, more bitter against it than before. Comfort lists a humorous yet very real church example:<br /><br />\\"God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life. He loves you and wants to give you TRUE happiness and to fill the God-shaped vacuum in your heart ... come forward to receive Christ and experience a wonderful new life. While they are coming, let's pray for the Smiths who lost their two children in a car accident this week. Brother Jones has been diagnosed with cancer. His wife had another miscarriage, and both their other children are chronic asthmatics. Sister Bryant fell and broke her hip ... Elder Chambers lost his job...Sister Lancing died of kidney failure...how many more have other diseases or troubles we can pray for? That many? Let's stay in our seats; we'll have a corporate prayer.\\"<br /><br />The Church is facing a serious problem of a watered-down gospel, Comfort shows us in the first several chapters of the book. He then proceeds to show a much more Biblical method of witnessing, using the powerful conviction of God's Law. If you've seen the TV program, a lot of the material is repeated. If you haven't seen the program, I recommend seeing it very soon, because it's much better to observe than read.<br /><br />Comfort shows the ease of talking to people, and asking them simple questions such as \\"are you a good person?\\" and then asking the questions \\"have you ever lied? stolen something? taken God's name in vain? looked in lust?\\" (Wait for their answers, almost all of which will `yes') \\"Then by your own admission, you're a lying, thieving blasphemous adulterer at heart, and you have to face God on Judgment Day. If God judges you by what you just admitted, will you be innocent or guilty? Will you go to heaven or hell?\\"<br /><br />I can't lay out the entire witnessing method for you, although I'd sure like to. I'm a mere college student, yet I've found the courage to witness to probably a dozen or more people since discovering how to witness in the Way of the true Master, Jesus himself. (That's a 1200% increase over the last decade, folks) I really can't say enough about how crucial this is. We as Christians HAVE to be equipped not just to talk to people who ask questions, but to actually take initiative and take God's convicting power of the gospel to them.<br /><br />Please buy this book. Please, please, please. It's easy to read, and trust me, it will revolutionize the way you approach witnessing for Christ. I haven't had anyone blow me off, give me the finger, or try to hit me. The people I've talked withhave, for the most part, been extremely receptive and ponderous of the message.<br /><br />The book has changed how I approach evangelism (the fact that I approach it at all, with the Lord's help) and I daresay it will definitely change yours. Please don't take these claims lightly, or think I've been asked to write this. I only want my Christian brothers and sisters to be fully-armed to take their stand against the Evil One.<br /><br />And best of all, you'll be following in great footsteps...the true Way of the Master.I've talked with have, for the most part, been extremely receptive and ponderous of the message.  <br /> <br />The book has changed how I approach evangelism (the fact that I approach it at all, with the Lord's help) and I daresay it will definitely change yours.

It's loaded down with intelligence, brilliance, and biting anti-liberal zingers, but most of it isn't original. It's a collection of Ann's columns for the past couple of years, with a few revisions here and there. (To account for new numbers and such) <br /> <br />Nevertheless, conservatives can't and shouldn't resist the opportunity to absorb the charming wit that Ann has graced us with, commenting on various news items and figures as the war on terror progresses. <br /> <br />While others may spend time both laughing at AND rebutting liberals, Coulter gives them no credence, credit -- or mercy. She merely passes them on the wayside, laughing merrily at their discrepancies,  inconsistencies, irregularities, and delightful contradictions. Sometimes, in the rush to wage the war against liberalism in the market of free ideals (which, at last check, is progressing splendidly), commentators and pundits forget to just sit back and laugh out loud at the utter absurdity of liberalism. <br /> <br />One cannot necessarily outline or describe the general lay of the book, since it is a veritable buffet of Coulter Columns. Therefore, if you understand that it is columns, and not all-new material that you are buying, I highly suggest you purchase this book to add to (or start!) your collection. Don't miss out on the wonderful, refreshing, informative, entertaining perspective by the woman Newsmax magazine calls \\"the acid-tongued Joan-of-Arc of the right.\\" <br />	2005-01-06

To date, there has been no credible evidence produced that dispels or refutes anything the Swift Boat Veterans have to say in this book. They have nothing to gain by telling their story or by lying. In fact, by coming out with this truth, they have a lot to lose! They knew they would be besmirched and reviled, and that people would try to discredit them.     John Kerry, on the other hand, has everything to gain by lying. He underestimated the gumption of the people who were there and knew the truth, and, while backtracking on the obvious, refuses to sign form 180 to release all of his records. (Bush has)    I'm glad that they still have the intestinal fortitude to face down the double-barreled assault leveled against them for telling the truth. These guys were the real heroes of Vietnam, and are still showing it today. John Kerry ran away when he was fired on in Vietnam, and ran away when the Swift Vets first came out. Kerry chose to hide behind personal attacks against them, rather than answering their charges.    The basic premise and content of the book is that Kerry obtained five medals, some given without the due processes, and by inflicting minor wounds upon himself. One medal was because of a grenade he fired at a boulder. Even so, he only had a scratch on his arm. The second was because of another grenade.  The book also points out that it's extremely odd and unusual for someone to have gotten three medals within the space of less than four months. Nonetheless, a good deal of soldiers around Kerry advised him to leave because they were tired of dealing with his careless antics and spotlight-grabbing capers. Kerry says he debated about this for two weeks, but between his third Purple Heart and his applying for reassignment was only four days.The first Purple Heart was received for wounds suffered on December 2, 1968. But in Kerry's own journal written nine days later, he writes he and his crew, \\"hadn't been shot at yet\\". Kerry's campaign has said it is possible this first Purple Heart was awarded for an unintentional self-inflicted wound. This first medal was the result of Kerry firing a grenade too close to shore and getting a thread stuck in his arm.    The second Purple Heart claim Kerry made was that his boat was fired upon with intense rocket and mortar fire, and a chunk of shrapnel hit his leg. He managed to beat a retreat with blood running down the deck, or so he says. But in fact, the boat was not damaged at all, and nearby officer Rocky Hildreth points out that he wouldn't have missed hearing all that noise, but somehow he never heard a thing!    The Silver Star was given because Kerry and Hildreth plotted two days before to beach their vessels and try to shoot out a bunker. The act was foolish, but fortunately, there was only one kid in the thing, who took of running once he emptied his grenade launcher.    The third Purple Heart and Bronze Star were awarded for unknown injuries which Kerry claimed were the result of another rocket attack.    To me, the most damaging quote comes from Kerry himself in a book called The Vietnam Experience: A War Remembered, wherein the brave volunteer with shrapnel in his leg admits \\"[Swift Boats] were engaged in coastal patrolling and that's what I thought I was going to be doing. Although I wanted to see for myself what was going on, I didn't really want to get involved in the war.\\"    At best, John Kerry is a bumbling anti-war activist. At worst, he is a political opportunist. The latter makes more sense -- no other Vietnam Veteran took a VIDEO CAMERA to Vietnam to document and reenact battles, no other Vietnam Vet runs around talking nonchalantly about heroic deeds and medals and the like. True Vietnam heroes don't see themselves as heroes, and were so scarred by the events that they wish to remain silent about it.    John Kerry later called the Vietnam war \\"the biggest nothing in history,\\" and alleges that he tossed his medals over the White House fence. Unfortunately, the war today isn't as meaningless as he thought the war was back then, but he's still trying to paint it as such.    John Kerry is Unfit For Command for a host of different reasons, but the facts in this book make John Kerry look far more sinister than a traditional politician. Buy it, read it, and decide for yourself.	2004-10-24
US	37321260	RSE5PP3G5DWUW	0310247071	331850456	Retribution (City of God Series #3)	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Stuck in the City of God	Randall Ingermanson has to be one of the best little-known authors I know. Hopefully that will change, but as far as I see it, his works are not extremely popular. Ingermanson crafted an original story to tell of Rivka Myers and Ari Kazan, a Christian and a Jew, brought together and bound in the same plight; stuck in the Jerusalem A.D. 66, sent back by scientist Damien West, who used the two as elaborate guinea pigs to test his time-traveling wormhole, so that he could eventually make good on his plan to obliterate Christianity by assassinating the apostle Paul. You can read what happened with that plot line, but that's just background.  <br />  <br />PLOT: <br />Ari and Rivka, now married, are stuck in ancient Israel, with no way to return. Rivka is a historian and archaeologist who knows the history of Israel after Christ's death as well as anyone can, and with that knowledge, gains a reputation as a \\"seer women\\", as well as a favorable reputation as a midwife. Ari, a brilliant physicist, is able to get a job as a construction overseer, and while his bright plans for the temple and buildings bring 21st century smarts to ancient Israel, he becomes enemies with Hanan ben-Hanan, the high priest at the time. <br />  <br />Now Ari and Rivka are hurtling towards an inescapable turn of events; Jewish revolt, persecution of Christians, and the eventual destruction of Jerusalem as the Jews know it. Ari decides to use his knowledge of physics to help the men of violence plan their machines of war in preparation for revolt. Rivka's knowledge of the events grows thin, but learns that HaShem (\\"The Name\\" in Hebrew -- Jewish name for God) wants her to become a true prophetess for Him. <br />  <br />At the same time, we see things from the point of view of Berenike, the wife of Governor Florus, the man who carries out the despicable acts of persecution against the Jews. <br />  <br />You'll be riveted as you watch Ari, Rivka, their daughter Rachel, and their friends Baruch and Hana and their child Dov, live in a pivotal moment in history. <br />  <br />GOOD: The plot is good, the characters are great, the story is awesome. The entire story is extremely educational. Close your eyes (which won't work for long because you won't be able to read!) and you can picture the mud/clay houses, the dusty streets, the colorful and busy marketplace, the temple, alter, courtyard, guards. More than two-dimensional cutouts in a story book, you'll see the characters come to life in three-dimensional, fleshed-out day-to-day life. You'll see what life was like without modern conveniences. <br />  <br />BAD/OBJECTIONABLE: Life is rugged and simple back then, and Ingermanson doesn't skip on details. Rivka spits on ben-Hanan and informs him that this makes him unclean because she is unclean because of her monthly period of uncleanness. Queen Berenike's immoral dress and the men who lust after her as a result occurs several times in the book. As well, she goes to the bed of her brother Florus, to `persuade' him to do something, with the scene ending with the very strong suggestion of what follows. Several times, people use the bathroom in all but detailed terms (I.E. `she squatted over the pan and did her business'). One man relates a story of a Gentile who despised the temple so much he pulled down his pants, exposed his tushie to the temple, and made a rude noise. (Of course they did it back then) There is also disturbing word images of crucifixions, including one young man, one five-year-old boy, one young women, and old women, and then one of our favorite characters, who dies a gruesome death. A better and more cringe-inducing crucifixion scene I have not found, except in The Passion of the Christ. <br />  <br />This book is an intense, rugged, very realistic portrayal of Bible times. It gives excellent historical perspective to that period in history, and helps the reader feel very much like he or she is right there. It's an excellent read, and another scoreby Ingermanson. Five out of five.	2004-10-19
US	37321260	RU0YFZYHF3X93	0345357116	517898316	Unfinished Tales: The Lost Lore of Middle-earth	Books	5	17	19	N	N	Mandatory reading for Tolkien aficionados	Next to The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales is probably your best resource for learning more about the history and behind-the-scenes events that took place during, and before the War of the Ring. <br /> <br />The book begins with a summery and overview by editor Christopher Tolkien, who as you may have figured out, is John Ronald Reuel Tolkien's son. There's also an introduction, explaining why Christopher Tolkien left some texts unaltered, or why he altered, or did not give altered versions, or definitions and clarifications between differing versions of similar stories...it's all a little long-winded and not entirely necessary in my humble opinion. But perhaps it is important to some. Unfinished Tales is, after all, a large compilation of the scraps and tidbits of information that Professor Tolkien scrawled out in spare time, put together and alongside entire revisions of different stories. I can't imagine the sticky process it took to put this all together. <br /> <br />The book is divided into four sections. <br /> <br />The First Age section entails the story of Tuor, the escaped slave of Morgoth, warned by the \\"god\\" of waters, Ulmo, of the impending danger to the bulwark fortress of Gondolin. Tuor journeys with the aid and guidance of a sea-faring Elf, Voronw, to the stronghold of Gondolin, and offers his message at last to its great king. Since the tale ends here (with only cursory description of the events that followed), I recommend reading The Silmarillion first, if you haven't already, to find out how it turns out. I have, but some of the details were difficult to recall. <br /> <br />Following is the incredibly tragic (and in this rendition, long!) tale of Turin, or rather, Narn I Hn Hrin, the tale of the children of Hrin. I read it because I didn't want to leave anything skipped, but it's only a more detailed retelling of the same story found again in The Silmarillion. It's such a sad, sordid tale that I don't think I would have lost anything by skipping over it. <br /> <br />The Second Age section tells the story of Aldarion, a future king of Nmenr, whose love for the sea is threatened by his love for the maid Erendis, vice-versa. I thought the story was woven incredibly well, except for the fact that it ends abruptly. (I was upset, until I closed the book and remembered that -- duh -- they're UNFINISHED Tales!) From all indications, the ending wasn't too happy anyway. But the story is still of high value for its descriptions of the island of Nmenr. <br /> <br />There is a brief recounting of genealogies of the line of Elros, the first king of Nmenr, and then a scattered gathering of information about Galadriel and her relationship to Celeborn. Various different versions are compared, very little is concretely presented.  <br /> <br />The Third Age is probably my favorite section. It would appear that interest, at least in my case, grows stronger as the time draws closer to the War of the Ring. The first story, The Disaster of the Gladden Fields, is virtually all-new material regarding the march of Isildur after he cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand, how Isildur's army was overtaken by orcs, and how Isildur found his end. There's even a little information about what King Elessar (Aragorn, of course) found in the tower of Orthanc following Saruman's demise!  <br /> <br />Then there is the tale of the great grandsire of the Rohirrim, Eorl, and his assistance that he provided to Cirion, the steward of Gondor, in his greatest need, much as Thoden later did. Unfortunately, this tale tells of how Eorl led his troops forth, and all kinds of details about his journey -- and cuts short just as the battle begins. Don't blame Christopher Tolkien though...it's one of the Unfinished elements. We're also told of the pledge between Gondor and Rohan, and of the gift of the land of Rohan to the Eorlingas. <br /> <br />Then we get some more, extra information about the Quest of  Erebor, where Bilbo Baggins of the Shirewas first persuaded to join thirteen dwarves on an impossible mission to reclaim the great dwarf treasure hoard which was stolen by the dragon Smaug. It is told from Gandalf's perspective to the hobbits inside Minas Tirith following the coronation of Aragorn, which gives it an added bonus, much like seeing extended material on the special extended DVD of the movie. <br /> <br />There are also stories that fill in what happened during the Hunt for the Ring, including a confrontation between the Nazgl and Grima Wormtongue, and the other goings about that the Dark Riders conducted. <br /> <br />The Battle for the Fords of Isen is background, merging with the story in The Two Towers just as Thoden and his troops arrive at Helm's Deep. It also deals with Thodred's death, and the valor that he, Elfhelm, Grimbold, Erkenbrand, and omer and other generals showed during the decline of Rohan's kingdom. <br /> <br />Part four deals quickly with three things: The Dredain (the forest-dwellers briefly seen in Return of the King book, and also the originators of the Pkal-men), the Istari, and the Palantiri. All three fill a mere forty pages, but still provide many interesting and awesome facts about the Seeing-stones, Gandalf's arrival upon the shores of Middle-Earth, etc. <br /> <br />There's also a large index of names and places in the back. <br /> <br />This book is fundamental for hard-core, book-reading fans of Tolkien. You can learn all sorts of behind-the-scenes events that took place in Middle-Earth, and then shock (or repulse) your friends, or just fill out your knowledge of Tolkienology with peripheral information. It's not quite as enjoyable to read as the linear, completed works like the trilogy, the Hobbit, or even the Silmarillion provide, but still very useful. Most likely the fact that you're looking this book up means you should buy it, and I recommend you do.	2004-07-24

The motion picture score that Howard Shore composed for The Lord of the Rings trilogy is absolutely brilliant, and while nothing can match his magnificent orchestra, there is something unique and incredible about hearing the same music played on a simple piano -- coming from your very own fingers.<br />The front cover is one of the promotional posters (NOT the DVD cover as was the case with the other two piano books from the trilogy) showing Saruman from the back commanding his 10,000 Uruk-hai. If you look on the right, although it is geographically incorrect, you can see Edoras in Rohan in the distance. Inside the book are forty pages, eight of which are movie pictures. Once again, there are some gruesome orcs pictured inside, in case you have little hobbits around the house that might get scared.<br />The music includes:<br />- Gollum's Song, the end-credits song of the movie. Not very enjoyable to play, I'd say...it's a rather mournful and melancholy song.<br />- Evenstar, which is all-Elvish, but surprisingly doesn't provide the translation. Shouldn't be too hard to dig one up on the internet, however. The tune is pretty, the background for Aragorn's dream/vision of Arwen in The Two Towers.<br />- Isengard Unleashed, which begins as the soundtrack score does, with the lament for Haldir upon his untimely death in the battle for Helm's Deep. Then it moves on to the score for the Ents as they march to war. This is probably the longest in the book, maybe of all three books. Afterwards, they give the translation of the war song of the Ents.<br />- Breath of Life, the quiet but stirring tune/song that you hear when Aragorn lies wounded after a battle, and receives another vision/dream of Arwen that gives him a (let's all say it together now) \\"breath of life\\". Elvish lyrics, English translation at the end.<br />- Forth Eorlingas, my favorite one (at least to HEAR), the tune that shows the rousing of the remaining soldiers at Helm's Deep, their death plunge out the causeway, and Gandalf's near-biblical arrival to the rescue. The second-best in this book, in my opinion.<br />- Rohan, which was an absolutely necessary piece to include in this book. It's short, *almost* simple enough for a beginner like me to pick my way through, and beyond gorgeous. It begins with the noble theme for Éowyn, and peaks into the majestic score for the kingdom of Rohan. This one alone is worth getting the book for.<br />This book makes an excellent addition to your piano library, or an excellent gift for your musically-inclined hobbit-heads. Go for it.	2004-07-05

It's books like this that made me wish I had the natural talent for music, or had at least studied and practiced hard enough to develop talent. The motion picture score that Howard Shore composed for The Lord of the Rings trilogy is absolutely brilliant, and while nothing can match his magnificent orchestra, there is something unique and incredible about hearing the same music played on a simple piano -- coming from your very own fingers.<br />The music on the pages can be described as intermediate level. Beginners will have trouble, but intermediates can slowly pick their way through, depending on their experience, and get better with practice.<br />The front cover is the same design as the DVD poster, and the original movie promotional art. Inside, 26 pages, including four front-and-back pages containing pictures from the movie.<br />The tracks you can play are:<br />- In Dreams, the end-credits song featured in the CD track \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship\\".<br />- The Prophecy, the never-used track that was, I believe, intended for the movie's prologue. The sheet music includes the Elvish lyrics, with the translation following at the end of the song.<br />- Aníron, the theme for Aragorn and Arwen, as sung by Enya. Again, the Elvish is provided in the music, and the translation at the end.<br />- Lament for Gandalf, featured in the Lothlorien track. It has the haunting sound that is used for the Elves at that part in the movie, but, as the title suggests, is almost a funeral dirge for Gandalf after the Elves learn of his death. Again, Elvish in the music, translation at the end.<br />- Many Meetings, the cerebral and heavenly theme for the Elven haven of Rivendell. Probably one of my favorite in the book, and one that, once you learn to play it through, will be something you'll want to play over and over.<br />- May It Be, the other end-credits song (actually, May It Be is the end credits song, and In Dreams is the *other* one) performed once again by Enya. The lyrics don't make a whole lot of sense, but it's still another quiet one to play. Since Enya only uses a smattering of Elvish in her song, the translation is provided within the music.<br />I think most fans will agree there were better selections that could have been made for the Fellowship of the Ring sheet music...the Hobbit theme, Moria, and the Bridge of Khazad-Dûm to name a few. But for the Lord of the Rings fans, lovers of gorgeous music, and people who are both, this book makes an excellent gift, or a just-for-you purchase!	2004-07-04

Or, with today's synthesizer technology, you can orchestrate your own versions!<br />The cover is the same as the Return of the King promotional photo. Inside, one can find fifty-four lovely pages' worth of selections from his score for Return of the King. Included in that tally are six pages of rich photos from the movie. Thankfully, it's just the heroes this time, there are no frightening pictures of orcs which, as in the case of the first and second books, caused the need to keep an eye on little youngsters who might be a little frightened by the ugly and gruesome orcs. Shoot, they still frighten me! ;-)<br />The songs include:<br />- Minas Tirith, the theme for Gandalf's ride to the City of Kings, and Pippin Took's first glimpse of the grandeur of the stronghold. Lyrics are included for the Elvish verses sung in the background, including the Retreat from Osgiliath, and The White Rider. This is one of the best songs, if you ask me, because it includes the gorgeous theme for Gondor.<br />- The Steward of Gondor, which includes the White Tree \\"theme\\" (not a really defined royal theme, unfortunately), and Billy Boyd's solo he sung to Denethor as Faramir rode out on his suicide mission. <br />- Twilight and Shadow, with is essentially a \\"poor Frodo\\" score, but also includes some music for Arwen.<br />- The End of All Things, the tumultuous but awing cacophony that you hear during the battle on the slopes of Mt. Doom and subsequently before the Black Gates as Frodo attempts to destroy the Ring, and Aragorn leads his troops in a lasteffort to distract Sauron. (As you can imagine, this, like the others, is not exactly a simple tune for beginners, but I was able to pick out some Lord of the Rings tunes, so middling players ought to be able to do okay) Lyrics are included for the many verses sung in the background of this as well. <br />- The Return of the King, which begins with Frodo's awakening and the reuniting of the Fellowship, and then Aragorn's coronation. At the end, sheet music fans FINALLY get the music for the Hobbiton theme, which is titled \\"A Toast in the Shire\\".<br />- Into the West, Annie Lennox's endearing song which pretty much sings about heaven, or at least Middle-Earth's version of it.<br />- Use Well The Days, a bonus because fans haven't yet heard how Howard Shore has arranged this one! It's pretty certain it will be crafted into the Return of the King: Extended Edition which releases around Christmas. From the lyrics, one would infer that it is sort of a benediction that Frodo gives to Sam, although I seriously doubt it is sung that way.<br />For your piano players, guitar-strummers, and singers, make 'em happy, give them some of the most awesome soundtrack ever to be played for the Lord of the Rings movies.	2004-06-22

I only wish I had bought it sooner, and that's the truth. I think few people can deny that the weapons used in Lord of the Rings are some of the most gorgeous cinema arms ever produced. Whether it be the styled curve of the Elven glaive Aiglos, or the pristine steel straight-edge of Narsil, there's just something about those weapons that makes a person want to grab one and start hacking some uruks! For such arms lovers, this book takes a satisfying look at all the weapons, techniques, styles, and strategies of the combat in Middle-Earth.<br />Beginning in the Second Age with the Noldorian Elves and Númenórian troops, the book follows through to the beginning of the Fourth Age, and covers all manner of races and their styles, armor, and weapons in between. The book also does in-depth profiles of crucial characters and their arms, such as Gil-Galad, Elendil, Isildur, Elrond, Boromir, Faramir, Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Théoden, Éowyn, Éomer, Gandalf, Legolas and Gimli. Even a yet-unseen profile of the Mouth of Sauron! As well, the book examines locations of several crucial battles and battle plans, including the battle at Gorgoroth, Amon Hen, Moria, Lothlorien, Helm's Deep, The Pelennor Fields, the Siege of Gondor, Morannon, and Amon Sul.<br />Illustrated with hundreds of colorful pictures from the movie and conceptual illustrations (many pictures, especially of the weapons themselves, are new, but the illustrations for the most part can be found in The Art of Return of the King), it's quite worth reading again and again, or keeping it on your coffee table to emphasize for guests how kooky over Lord of the Rings you are. <br />The book's style is that of an actual history book from Middle-Earth itself, by which I mean it uses language such as \\"artifacts have been unearthed in Mordor\\", or \\"eyewitness accounts testify that such-and-such\\", discussing it asif it were history, not myth. Oftentimes, the author attempts to justify book-to-movie alterations by quoting \\"conflicting accounts\\". (The book, of course, focuses on the movie weapons, in case you were in doubt about that) Parents should be advised that this book discusses balrogs, trolls and uruk-hai in detail, including many photos of these grotesque warriors, so if young children are about, it would be advisable to remove this book from their reach.<br />I found it an excellent read, and if you can't find any other reason to purchase this book . . . there's a picture of Legolas inside. ;-)	2004-06-02

I recommend it.	2004-05-14

Coulter magnificently and efficiently demolishes any and all lingering hesitation in a style somewhat reminiscent of the voice of Gandalf the White, dispersing the fog of Saruman's enchanting voice with a laugh.<BR> <BR>Most conservatives are able to detect the liberal nuances in \\"objective\\" media reports, and columnists, but it's always just too subtle to put a finger on. Then along comes Ann, and she's got a net in which she catches each little catch-phrase and platitude until she's got a writhing, wriggling mass of them, painting a foreboding picture for Left-wing reporting.<br />Stepping back in history (but not too far), Coulter takes us through the historical record that liberals hope like mad no one will point out. Hypocrisy abounds, from leaving a ignoring a philandering statesmen (solely because they happen to agree with them on issues such as abortion) to shoving the lie of \\"conservative\\" bias in the media down American citizens' throats. <br />I found chapter five fascinating in particular. Going back to the 2000 election (you know, the one that liberals can't seem to get over?) Coulter demonstrates the left-wing media's responsibility for the election mess, from calling certain regions for Gore (before the polls closed) to reporting that polls closed (when in fact they hadn't). Suddenly, it all becomes clear; left-wing journalists fouled that up from the beginning.<br />Then we go back and look at the lie that the public was told about Bush (and the same lie that was attempted to be passed off about Reagan), that he was unintelligent. I must confess even I had fallen prey to the idea that perhaps George W. Bush isn't the most eloquent in the world, based strictly on media reports of foul-ups, misstatements, and verbal slip-ups. Coulter smashes that idea by pointing out documented proof of media celebrities who emphasize Bush, and downsize Gore (who had a fair share of his own slip-ups!)<br />Finally, Coulter crushes the myth of the \\"religious right\\" that is constantly referred to. The problem regarding that is, it is both an enormous bullying lobby, and a weak and feeble organization that has been wiped out, it seems liberals can't decide which.<br />Newsmax Magazine calls Ann Coulter the \\"acid-tongued Joan-of-Arc of the Right\\", and make no mistake about it. Coulter's exhaustive footnotes (thirty-five pages' worth) spell out the sad and sordid tale of liberal deception that has plagued Washington politics for decades. If enough thinking Americans could get this book into their hands, it would spell a sad and sordid fate for the Left too.<br />Conservatives, wash your minds out with this. Liberals? If you're going to post negative reviews, do us all a favor and read the book first. If you won't, then stick to your hate-filled mouthing-off books by Michael Moore and Al Franken, and leave the intelligent dialogue to us.	2004-03-10

Ralph C. Wood shows his true understanding of Tolkien's works, extending beyond just the trilogy of books itself. <br />No one can deny that, while eschewing blatant allegory (ala C.S. Lewis), Tolkien inserted numerous Christian themes and principles into his wonderful 1,000 + literary work. Wood works his way through the beginning of Middle-Earth (not going back to the Shire; I'm talking the very beginning, when Eru first began the Symphony of Creation) to discuss the Music of the Ainur that sang into being Arda, the world within. No one can deny that a supernatural Father of All (\\"Eru\\" literally translated \\"The One\\" in Elvish) creating a world with the music of his divine minions is too far off from the mainstream Judeo-Christian story of Biblical Creation. But this is just the beginning. Wood next explores the disfigurement of celestial accord found in the original Dark Lord Morgoth, whose workings wrought great woe in Middle-Earth's founding years. Wood then looks at how evil is countered throughout the ages of Middle-Earth, followed by Tolkien's redeeming principles of life, and finally the lost tale of the coming Consummation of Middle-Earth. <br />I found the book on a whole to be rather academic, long-winded, and at times dull. But some can find this to be the case with Tolkien's books as well, so you should know what you're in for. Anyone who HAS seen the trilogy through in book form should be able to stick with this. While academic in nature, the contemplations, and revelations are none the less enjoyable. <br />Again, very comprehensive and complete study of the theological themes gleaned from these works, and if you are interested in learning more about them, buy this book.<br />Comical side note: Be aware when you buy this book that roughly 50% of the cost is devoted to ten-dollar words like \\"milquetoast\\", \\"supernal\\", \\"repudiate\\", \\"concupiscence\\", and \\"ubiquitous\\".	2004-01-24

Included are six wonderfully large maps of the different regions of Middle-Earth, including the vast plains of Rohan and its adjoining lands, the dark land Mordor, the northern wilds of Eregion (the lands that lie west of the Shire, including Bree, Weathertop, the Trollshaws, Rivendell, Hollin, Caradhras, Moria and Lothlórien), two maps to show both West and East Gondor, and a highly-detailed map of the four farthings of the Shire.<br />Each map is highly detailed, and looks quite similar to the ones drawn for the Lord of the Rings books. The maps (if you succeed in making the creases in them disappear) are high quality, and worthy of framing if you want. <br />There is also an excellent 32-page book that takes you over each region included on each map, examining its importance to the Fellowship's Quest, and to the history of Middle-Earth in general. The book includes all six maps shrunk down to page-size in the back, a general map of Middle-Earth on the back cover, and an index for location reference. <br />Cheers to Daniel Reeve and crew for their excellent calligraphy work as well as research and planning. This set is a perfect compliment to the books. For those who enjoyed the movies and want to learn more, for those of you who want to brush up on some Tolkien knowledge so your well-versed friends won't have such an edge on you, and for Tolkien fans everywhere, you will love this set.	2004-01-11

This book is shorter than most of the others, the anthologies as they are called, but still chock full of loads of laughs. The book is 128 pages long, and is probably one of the more recent published form of the Foxtrot cartoon strip by Bill Amend. <br />Included is the sage of Jason's Spider-Man movie anticipation, or \\"When web shooters go bad\\", as well as the Star Wars II wait. You'll also laugh as Jason prepares to take over Martha Stewart's million dollar empire, and goes camping with the rest of the family.<br />Bottom line, I get genuinely concerned when/if I don't understand the humor in a Foxtrot comic, or if I fail to smile or laugh, and I'm quite positive you'll enjoy this book at least as much as I did.

It is chock full of 250 pages of the popular strip by Bill Amend, and, with very few exceptions, you'll laugh at every strip. <br />The actual \\"camp\\" doesn't happen until somewhere near the middle of the book, where brainy Jason and his friend Marcus go to Geek Camp for the summer, just to let you know, but you won't mind, I promise.<br />There is a delightful little bonus kindly provided by the author at the end (\\"My publisher tells me I have six blank pages to fill\\") which documents the path that Amend started down in order to become the success he is today. Amend takes six pages to discuss how he creates the strips (does he draw them, or think up the plotline first?) and how he submits and is hired out to do them regularly (so what exactly is the running salary for a cartoonist these days anyway?) with tips on how a person with talent can attempt to do the same. <br />I get genuinely concerned when/if I don't understand the humor in a Foxtrot comic, or if I fail to smile or laugh.

But it is not very helpful now, and plot-wise, it wasn't helpful back then. It is just a collection of pictures from The Fellowship of the Ring, with a smattering of text about the plot. The pictures, actually, are out of order. The front cover is also not very enticing, which was fixed for the photo guides of the next two movies.<br />Face it, you can find these pictures and tons more all over the internet. If you are the ultimate, die-hard fan who has to have every bit of LotR-related stuff, then go ahead and buy it, but otherwise, I would not recommend it.	2003-12-18

There, got that? Took ME long enough!<br />This book is an essential, and not only for Christians or homeschoolers, but anyone about to enter college. Seeing as how I'm a high school senior now, I found this book excellent prep for what I know I'm getting ready to go through.<br />In a short 140 pages, J. Budziszewski provides in-depth analysis and information for what to expect in college, and how to deal with it. He discusses how to hang tight to what you know is right, even when close friends, roommates, and peer groups don't. He offers insight on how to cope with non-Christian friends, and counteracts common campus myths, most of them the kind a Christian freshman might not know how to deal with. <br />He shoots down myths and smokescreens that often render Christians a little lost as to how to respond, even when they know there IS an answer) and brilliantly refutes such myths as moral relativism, atheism, etc. <br />He offers advice on how to deal with relationships, both friendship and the Deeper Kind, in a chapter that most students will flip right to: Myths about Love and Sex. He offers refreshing encouragement that you CAN stick to your morals and remain chaste in college, and that it's not only obeying God, but rewarding in its own right!<br />Budziszewsky also hits (briefly) on political issues, something that few can avoid in today's campus life.<br />Finally, he sums it all up by discussing WHY all this is important, and highlights the fact that you should fit college into God's plan, not God into college plans. He leaves us with a reminder that we are given a purpose in life, a unique meaning of serving the Lord, and how everything around us factors into Eternity, whether we realize it or no.<br />In case you haven't figured out already, I think this book is brilliant, masterful, and a comprehensive must-have for any up-and-coming collegian. Parents, your sons and daughters are missing out if you don't get this for them. Students, if you can spare the money, this book is guaranteed to give new meaning and purpose into your collegian existence.	2003-12-10

Actually, among the somewhat useless line of merchandise that springs from the idea that eager Lord of the Rings fans (and those who are especially anticipating the December 17th release of the third and final movie) will buy anything, this book is actually a useful tool. It would be the most helpful for the fan who wants to introduce a friend or family member to the series beloved by millions, or perhaps just an individual who wants to know what all the fuss is about. <br />The book gives background for the upcoming Return of the King release mainly, but also gives a short but sweet background of what's happened before. With lovely new pictures of the movie, the text takes the reader from Mordor to Cirith Ungul, and from Gondor, to Isengard, to Rohan, to everywhere in between, explaining the complicated plot and complex characters along the way. <br />The book is so helpful that if a person reads this book a few times, he might conceivably be able to walk in to theaters on December 17th and actually watch the third movie without having watched the first two, though I would not recommend it at all!<br />If you need a refresher (remember, watching the first two movies is the best way!), and don't have time for the movies, just sit down and read up on this book, because it was written for you. If you're already a big fan, you might still get a kick out of the pictures, and you can always keep it handy for when your friends scratch their heads and say \\"Frodo WHO?\\" <br />Warning: The book does contain Return of the King spoilers.	2003-12-04
US	37321260	R2OG1938KZWH7X	0060652381	453295478	A Grief Observed	Books	5	28	29	N	N	Excellent book by an excellent author	Everyone has either experienced a tragic loss of life in the family. Perhaps a death in the extended family, or through a friend who might have lost a loved one. For Christians, grief is an especially tough time, taking them through cycles of questions about whether or not God really does love us when such brutally painful events take hold of us.<br />When author Clive Staples Lewis lost his wife to cancer in the 1960's, he was no different than any of us, finding himself asking the same questions about God's goodness and love that a lot of us have. Since Lewis had already lived a full life, his loss was deepened by the lack of promises of future happiness a younger person might find some small comfort in. Yet in the wee hours when his grief and anguish were the most poignant, Lewis - an author all the way - took to filling blank pads of paper in his house with the thoughts and feelings that his bereavement brought.<br />Even though I have not personally experienced anything near the kind of grief that this book deals with, I still found this book to be an amazing read. The deepest grief I've ever experienced was the loss of a family pet, yet from that small sampling I can just barely grasp what Lewis went through. Indeed any person not accustomed to grief can begin to understand it by reading the beautiful language that fills the pages of this book. <br />It is a short book, ringing in with only four chapters, and 76 pages. Yet all of them are filled with the balm of Lewis's reflections and introspection, and all of them are able to help a grieving person, if for nothing else than to know that they're not alone.<br />For any person who might be undergoing a period of sorrow, I highly recommend this book. It is not a lot of heavy reading, thus possibly making it easier on someone who is already in such pain. The wonderfully poetic, graceful language gives body and soul to the multitude of emotions that wash through a grieving person, especially in dark hours. Theseemotions, I'm sure, are experienced by everyone, but with the comments and insight of one of Christendom's favorite authors, it makes this work a priceless treasure. <br />If you, or someone you know is going through a difficult time of loss and heartache, buy this book for them. It is a must-read for anyone in pain.	2003-12-03

That fellow was me, and I finally located this book. I pawed through it for the better part of quarter hour, and now present my review for it.<br />Of course, many of these pictures surfaced on the internet before this book came out, but it's still nice to have it in book form. The book itself is rather small, but you can't judge a book by its cover, after all! There's some awesome pictures of our favorite heroes, and the perils they encounter in the upcoming cinematic release of Return of the King from New Line Cinema. <br />Keep in mind that this book is appealing now, but this is only because you have not seen the movie yet. Once the movie is released, the value for this book will dramatically plummet. Still, it's a thrill to get a look at a lot of the pictures and scenes from the upcoming movie that the world is waiting for.<br />And, in case you are concerned about these sorts of things, it goes without saying that this book contains many spoilers about the movie.

Also included are armor drawings and conceptual art for everything from heroes to evil creatures, as well as the vast array of swords and weapons incorporated in the films.<br />You can see it through the pages, these guys sincerely cared about getting this series right, and staying true to the spirit of Tolkien's beloved trilogy for the millions of fans who expect it.<br />Make sure you want this book, though - it's $35 and definitely does ruin some areas of the film.

I expected this book to be excellent, riveting, complex, and thrilling, and it was all of that, and more.<br />This book, the first of three, operates on its own, but it helps to gain background on the characters and the previous events leading up to where the reader drops in by reading Transgression. Whether the author realizes it or not, he sort of pulled a Tolkien on us; the book is not entirely necessary to understand and enjoy Premonition, yet really follows first and ought to be read first.<br />Quick background, Rivka Myers found herself rocketed centuries into the past by scientist Damien West, used as a guinea pig to test whether or not a wormhole in space did indeed warp occupants back to ancient Israel. Her newfound friend and fellow inventor Ari manages to follow her, and the two of them race against the clock to unmask Damien?s plan while still making it back to the wormhole before it collapses. If you decide you want to read that book first, then stop reading, because the book I?m reviewing now inevitably spoils some of the ending of the first book.<br />Rivka and Ari are now stuck in Ancient Israel. Married, even though Rivka is a believer in Yeshua Hamashiach, Jesus the Messiah, and Ari is not. Friends with former prostitute Hana, who is now married to Baruch, a follower of Yeshua. Cursed to live in a land drastically different from the world they know, they must adapt to the rugged land of Jerusalem, A.D. 57. <br />Rivka struggles against the attitude of men towards women in that era, as well as struggling to recall the historical period she read about back in her home in the 21st century. Having read many historical works on the time she now lives in, she is able to make predictions which earn her the reputation as Seer Woman. But when the information she relies upon fails, and her prediction is proved false, she is scorned as a witch woman, a false prophet. <br />Meantime her husband Ari has unwittingly picked a battle of honor and wits against a man of high power in the Temple of Jerusalem, and must fight against the hatred of Jews against Gentiles ? all the while slowly coming to grips with the Truth of Yeshua Hamashiach. <br />GOOD: There is much more detail in the plot than I can list. Many twists, turns, and unexpected events that occur which truly do make the reader feel as if he is on a roller coaster of events. The writing style is enjoyable, the characters fascinating, and the events are extremely incredible to read. While a lot of historical license is taken, the true essence of what happens is important for any Christian to understand. At the same time, it is incredible how Ingermanson deals with heavy questions such as all people face: WHY does God truly allow such terrible events as what happened in Ancient Israel? <br />BAD: There ain?t a lot bad to talk about, mate. The only thing that might bother a few people is the mercifully vague (yet occasionally vivid) descriptions of executions. There are also many descriptions of childbirths based on Rivka?s decision to become a midwife and assist the mothers in Israel. It also irked me just a little that a certain supernatural scene near the end took such a short time to describe. I can?t say more lest I spoil it, but you?ll know what I mean when you get there.<br />THOUGHTS: I really enjoyed this book. I think the author has great style, taste, and skill. A sentence from the Author?s Note in the beginning certainly evoked my laugher, and betrays the author?s sense of humor: ?Nobody knows exactly what happened, or why [In A.D. 57] ... It is fertile ground, then, for liars, misfits, rogues, halfwits, lunatics, novelists and other delusional types to invent a tale. I would be charmed if you would listen to mine.?<br />The book is an excellent read, one of a kind, and I recommend it highly. Eight out of ten stars!	2003-09-14

The Book of Lost Tales Part II continues the story of Eriol, a great mariner who finds his way to the lost island of Tol Eressëa, The Lonely Isle, where dwell a lost tribe of Elves. He continues to learn the stories of the ancient world they have to tell him, of the great heroes of the world after its corruption by the Dark Lord Melkor.<br />For readers of the Silmarillion, many of the stories are familiar. They are told, however, in greater detail than that which is set down in the Silmarillion, and contain several interesting literary differences. (Nearly all of which are expounded on by Christopher Tolkien, who is, of course, the son of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien.) Some are as small as name changes, some are opposing details about the events surrounding a character.<br />I enjoyed reading this book, partly because I am a Tolkien aficionado, and partly because it satisfies the fantasy itch in a lot of people, myself included. The Book of Tales 2 begins (sort of) where Book 1 left off. The stories that the editor, Christopher Tolkien sets forth are less whole and complete than those found in book 1, but this is by no means the fault of Christopher Tolkien. His father, beloved author and scholar J.R.R. Tolkien was perfecting and re-shaping these tales to his death in 1973.<br />Nonetheless, the stories are enjoyable to read. In Book 2, we read such stories as the Tale of Tinúviel (Or, Lúthien) the elf-maiden who forsook her immortal life for the love of a mortal man, Beren, much as the more popular union between Arwen and Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings books themselves. Of course, the most startling and shocking idea was that in this early version of the story, Beren was not a man at all, but an elf! He was but of another race of elves, which caused the high price of a Silmaril for Lúthien's hand in marriage by her father. There are several different elements of the story changed as well, such as Lúthien's  need to save her love from the house of Tevildo, (a feline precursor to Sauron?), the evil cat-like creature who enslaved Beren. Of course, all these changes and many more are commented on, and highlighted by the ever-thorough editor.<br />Also found is the story of Turin Turambar, the man who roamed Middle-Earth with much sorrow and woe, who won both misery and renown for his great skill and his misdeeds. An extremely sad (and long!) tale. <br />After this, the tale of the great fall of Gondolin, the great city of refuge, hidden from Morgoth until it was brought down by treason from within. Hence from this destruction escaped Ëarendil, the great mariner of whom great tales are told of later. The tale of the Nauglafring, the Necklace of the Dwarves is told following this tale, with different changes in it as well.<br />Following this is the tale of Ëarendil. This differs so much from the original story that most of us know from reading the Silmarillion that it's not nearly as wonderful of a story to read.<br />Finally, there is the history of Eriol, or Ælfwine, the man who first came to the Lonely Isle and learned these great stories from the Wise that dwell there. Most astounding and odd in this history is the idea that Tolkien had apparently conceived; that the lands where the Elves dwelled came over time to be England! The Lonely Isle was dragged from its place by Ulmo, but his rival Ossë took hold of it to drag it back, and broke of a part, which became Ireland. In this case, one must wonder where the land and time of Middle-Earth itself, with its hobbits, wizards and orcs came to pass, if that land eventually became England!<br />For my part, I find that these stories are fun to read, but if you are interested in the true substance of the tale, your best bet is to read the Silmarillion. The stories are often condensed, but they are in their finished state (as much as can befinished), and there are no footnotes to go and read.<br />Following the end of tales is an index on names, the etymologies, the development of names, etc. <br />Reading this book really gives you a feeling for how much work and effort went into the creation of the books we all enjoy, The Lord of the Rings. But little do we realize that there was a good three thousand years of history prior to that story - and Tolkien wrote it all. <br />If you have an enthusiasm for the works of Tolkien, the tales prior to the Rings trilogy, and the history of Middle-Earth, than you should read this book if you can. I'd recommend reading the Silmarillion first, even if you have already read it once; Christopher Tolkien compares the two many, many times. Also be forewarned that this book can be a little dry and long-winded. But for true Tolkien aficionados, it's worth every minute.	2003-08-03
US	37321260	R28A5MFMAE48UO	1590520807	574388179	The Lights of Tenth Street	Books	5	15	15	N	N	Christian thriller of massive proportions!	It's called the \\"sequel\\" to Shaunti Feldhahn's previous novel The Veritas Project. But in many ways, it's not. The sequel isn't exactly a sequel in that it doesn't demand that you read the first book first - it can operate on its own. And operate it does!<br />Due to the sweet setup I have going with my brother (he buys the books, and I read `em after he's done), I got to read this book almost immediately after it was released. The plot focuses on two primary characters, more or less. Sherry, the Harvard roommate of Claire Rivers (whom the plot revolved around in the first book) is now our protagonist. Sherry is now ten year older, married to Doug Turner, and has two kids of her own. The other main character is Ronnie Hanover, an abused teenager who makes a break for freedom from her home and joins her friend Tiffany in Atlanta, working at a strip club. At first, Ronnie despises the idea of the stripping, and only works as a waitress. But goading from her coworkers coupled with her financial needs soon finds her up on stage with the rest.<br />Meantime, there is a national organization of crime working the scene, weaving an incredibly complex web of conspiracy and intrigue; a scheme beyond the understanding of most involved, and beyond the reader's, until the very end. The mysterious Proxy is working with his second in command Tyson with their \\"clients\\" to perpetrate a terrorist act beyond the scope of the 9/11 tragedy.<br />Back at the Turners, there's a problem. Doug Turner finds himself sliding back into the same dangerous temptations that he fell into as a young man. He attempts to suppress and hide them, but he soon finds himself looking after female coworkers a little longer than he should, and reading bad magazines, then stopping by the strip club where his business partners held a meeting once - \\"just for the food\\". Doug is forced to deal with the problem when a worker at his company shows up with video of Doug at the strip club...and assures him that, unless he signs off on certain business deals, the video will make its way to his family and friends. Doug finds no alternative, and complies.<br />Of course, in the meantime, there are the angels that are somewhat involved in the story. To be honest, I think the angels are an unnecessary part of the book. In the style of Frank Peretti, the angels are in the story throughout, but do not really stick out in terms of what they do. They are the ministering spirits to the characters, but the plot focuses on the characters alone. When I began reading this, and I found a part about the angels, I was like \\"Oh yeah, I forgot there are angels in these books.\\"<br />There's a lot more to the plot, but it's too complex to go further. I could say things like \\"Will Doug confront his dangerous temptations? Will the crime organization win the day? Read this book to find out!\\" but I won't.<br />I have to say though, that the quality of this book highly impressed me. Once the action got rolling, I could barely put the book down. I was actually exclaiming out loud when things were going bad. I had an adrenaline rush just sitting on my bed reading. I was riveted to the action, and I feel certain you will be too.<br />And of course, comment on the sexual themes contained in this book. The author of the forward to the book stated that he wanted the book written in such a way that his 14-year-old teenager wouldn't stumble. He and I both agree that Feldhahn did a good job. While you shouldn't find bad thoughts popping into your mind, (unless you allow your imagination TOO much creative energy) this book most certainly isn't for younger readers. Feldhahn doesn't go too far in her descriptions, but nonetheless, we are inside the strip club numerous times with Ronnie.  Somehow, though, the author managed to avoid play-by-play descriptions, or anything else that would be considered less than wholesome.<br />Feldhahn also explains some of her motives in the end of the book. She explained how strangeand revealing it was to try to \\"get inside the male head\\" for this story, and includes a humorous discussion between her husband and her on the subject.<br />Overall, this book is an excellent fiction read, and it can shed a lot of light on the darker subjects that lots of people deal with in private, such as addiction to pornography. Perhaps it can also help us all to have less judging attitudes to those who are struggling, or even those who perpetrate the sinful temptations themselves. Great read and great message: what more could you ask for?	2003-06-21
US	37321260	R165YI8366UADF	0395354390	52698891	1: The Book of Lost Tales, Part One (History of Middle-earth)	Books	3	136	138	N	N	For Tolkein fans...wonderful!	It takes great strength of mind to be able to stick through this book, but if you're a true Tolkien fan, you'll love every minute of it. The Book of Lost Tales Part I tells the story of Eriol, a great mariner who finds his way to the lost island of Tol Eressëa, The Lonely Isle, where dwell a lost tribe of Elves. He finds himself in the company of Lindo and Vairë, who grant him shelter. He becomes a part of their lives, eagerly drinking in the stories they have to tell him of the origin of the world, and the ancient times, of Valinor, the origin of evil, the great works and deeds of the gods, and the creation of the world as it exists now.<br />For readers of the Silmarillion, many of the stories are familiar. They are told, however, in greater detail than that which is set down in the Silmarillion, and contain several interesting literary differences. (Nearly all of which are expounded on by Christopher Tolkien, who is, of course, the son of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien.) Some are as small as name changes, some are opposing details about the events surrounding a character. (Such as Dwarves were originally an evil race by nature, and Beren was an ELF!)<br />Christopher Tolkien pored through the scribbles and snatches that his father composed in his lifetime, and somehow managed to put it all together in this published form. He even offers commentary on each tale once it is finished. I often found that these commentaries are of little interest; I enjoyed the tales themselves more. Still, there are unique facts to be gleaned, such as such-and-such a page containing differences between this tale and that that Tolkien wrote, and a few interesting facts about his father.<br />The book contains the very beginning of Middle-Earth, as told to Eriol by Lindo. The Music of the Ainur, he learns of, and the coming of the gods down to Valinor. He learns of the dark deeds of Melko, the coming of the Elves, the darkening of Valinor, the creation of the sun and moon, the flight of the Noldili. The book ends with a tale told by an Elf named Gilfanon about the travail of the Noldili, who fled Valinor after the theft of Melko. Following the end of tales is an index on names, the etymologies, the development of names, etc. <br />Reading this book really gives you a feeling for how much work and effort went into the creation of the books we all enjoy, The Lord of the Rings. But little do we realize that there was a good three thousand years of history prior to that story - and Tolkien wrote it all. <br />If you have an enthusiasm for the works of Tolkien, the tales prior to the Rings trilogy, and the history of Middle-Earth, than you should read this book if you can. I'd recommend reading the Silmarillion first, even if you have already read it once; Christopher Tolkien compares the two many, many times.

I actually read these works in The Tolkien Reader, but I might as well share my opinions on this, since it's sold separately. The first two poems are about Tom Bombadil, but to tell the truth, they don't exactly give what a lot of Tolkien fans wish for: a history of Tom. Where he came from, and who he is. He remains a weird old man with yellow boots, I guess.<br />The other poems are a treat to read. Any readers of the Rings trilogy know that Tolkien favored many poems, and many of them were very good. A few of them will be recognized by Rings fans, because some of them are used, such as the Man in the Moon (which bears striking resemblance to the nursery rhyme about the Cow Jumping Over the Moon).<br />For Tolkien fans, this is a great book to read, but since this edition is not widely available, you should check out the Tolkien Reader.	2003-05-04

The Tribulation Force is the continuing drama of those Left Behind, the sequel of Jenkins/LaHaye's blockbuster novel Left Behind.<br />Journalist Buck Williams, airline pilot Rayford Steele, his college-age daughter Chloe Steele, and their pastor Bruce Barnes have formed a little union, a Tribulation Force, designed to combat the forces of darkness that are foretold to grow great on the earth, now that God's great Rapture has taken place. The four know that things are going to heat up fast, once Nicolae Carpathia, the charismatic leader that has risen quickly through the political strata, signs a peace treaty with Israel. This is an event foretold in the Bible - and one that confirms that this man is the very enemy of God, the antichrist himself. The four attempt to regain some sense of normalcy by returning to each's respective job or assignment, while at the same time armed with the knowledge of salvation, and prepared to bring as many as possible to that salvation. Rayford soon finds himself the pilot of the US President's personal plane, which is actually signed over to Carpathia and his delegation soon after. Rayford finds himself not only flying, but working at close proximity with the man whom he believes is the very enemy of his soul. <br />Meanwhile, Buck Williams attempts to forget his attraction to Chloe Steele, and flies to Israel to discover more about the mysterious preachers who have appeared at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem. These two seem to possess the power to make their message known in any foreign tongue, they preach the gospel of Jesus Christ - and they have the power to call down fire from heaven to devour those who try to kill them for their \\"heresy\\". Buck also meets a local celebrity of a scholar, Dr. Tsion Ben-Judah, who has just completed an enormous and much-anticipated study of ancient documents, texts, and scrolls, on his own personal quest to discover who the Messiah really is. He shocks the world when his internationally televised report reveals that Jesus Christ is the only man who could fit all of the Old Testament prophecies. <br />A little romance kindles, on the home front, when Rayford meets Amanda White, an old friend of his vanished wife. Buck also has an interest in Chloe, but must sort through some comical yet frustrating miscommunications.<br />And then the war comes. Militia who aren't happy with Nicolae's thrust into power - and the subsequent de-throning of the US President - attempt to attack the new Global Community military. The Tribulation Force struggles to stay alive when World War III breaks out.<br />BAD:<br />There's not any thing inherently bad in this book. Once again, you may disagree with the theology, but you'll still almost certainly find it enjoyable.<br />GOOD:<br />Tribulation Force's objective is to bring as many lost souls to Christ as possible. The events that unfold are direct from the book of Revelation, as Jenkins and LaHaye interpret them.<br />THOUGHTS: Things are going to get a little sticky in the great tribulation at the beginning of the end of the world, for sure, so you can expect violence at many turns in this book. However, the first two in the LB series are before the world is dramatically changed, so it's still enjoyable to read about things that sound more close to our life, before the great judgments come. If you buy this and the first book, unless you are totally displeased, I hope you have plans to buy the rest in this series.	2003-05-02
US	37321260	R2GK1BG2LNIMM6	0345215362	265710099	Tolkien Reader	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Great read for Tolkien fans	I received this book as a birthday gift, but I must confess it took the back burner, but only for a little while. I soon dug into it, an avid Tolkien fan, and found myself slogging through Tolkien's essay on Fairy stories.<br />First in this edition is a great little summary and analysis of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, popular in its own right, but now immensely popular at the box office since New Line released the first two novels as major motion pictures. The summary is written by Peter Beagle. Yeah, I know, I never heard of him either, but he summarized the series pretty well, without spoiling anything, so you'll enjoy reading it.<br />Then there's Tolkien's essay. The essay is somewhat long, and quite a hunk of literary philosophizing to bite off and chew . . . and it took me a while to chew. Once I got done, it was on to the more enjoyable things: Leaf by Niggle, the example and essence of all Tolkien wrote of in his essay, Farmer Giles of Ham, the story of the simple farmer whose one act of bravery, and the subsequent events made him a living legend, and the Adventures of Tom Bombadil.<br />The Adventures of Tom Bombadil gives little insight into the mysterious character that we briefly encounter in the first novel in the Rings series, The Fellowship of the Ring. He is a merry man whom the four hobbits meet in dire trouble, and who helps them on their journey. (This is the man that many fans of the books were disappointed not to see in New Line's cinematic version) While he seams innocent enough in the book, it is obvious that underneath he carries power, some sort of power, the prevents him from being influenced by the Ring, and gives him authority to command tree and leaf. But you learn little more about this fascinating character in the stories in Adventures of Tom Bombadil. Indeed, that section of the book contains a few poems of the doings of Bombadil, and a few other poems as well, some of which readers of the Rings books will recognize, being sung by the hobbits in the books.<br />Most of you will probably find Tolkien's essay rather dull and dry, but for the rest, it might be interesting to \\"get into\\" Tolkien's mind by reading this, and his insight into the realm of fantasy and tales. Most fans of the Lord of the Rings (and I'm talking FANS, not just movie-goers who liked the movie) will enjoy it, and if not the essay, then for sure the sections of stories and poems that follow.sung by the hobbits in the books.<br />Most of you will probably find Tolkien's essay rather dull and dry, but for the rest, it might be interesting to \\"get into\\" Tolkien's mind by reading this, and his insight into the realm of fantasy and tales.

US	37321260	R3M61WIYVYX8AF	0842329129	46316172	Left Behind: A Novel of the Earth's Last Days (Left Behind No. 1)	Books	5	10	16	N	N	A craze, a hype, a book	This is the book that set off a world-wide obsession  with the Left Behind series. This is the book that started the audio drama series, the kids' series, the movies, the board games, the website. This is the book whose following sequels hit and continue to hit the top of the New York fiction bestseller list.<br />So what's the big deal about Left Behind? While it differs from many denominational theologies and ideologies, even those who disagree on the Second Coming of Christ still enjoy reading these books. Why? Because it chronicles the fictional yet realistic events following the Rapture of Christ's people from the earth. <br />Here's the plot for this first book: Rayford Steele is an commercial airline pilot whose life is going okay. So okay, in fact, that he's pondering a potential deepening of his relationship with one of his online flight attendants, Hattie Durham. This, despite his happy marriage to his beautiful wife Irene, and their two kids, Chloe and Ray Jr. Meantime, famed journalist Cameron (\\"Buck\\") Williams is on Rayford's plane. Williams gained fame and renown by covering a massive air assault in Israel, one in which all of the enemy forces attacking were killed by a strange firestorm, and yet no casualties resulted on the Israeli's side -an event predicted by the Bible.<br />Both of their worlds - and the real world - are shaken as, in the blink of an eye, millions of people disappear, simply vanish out of their clothes, and out of this world. Rayford lands his plane safely, despite chaos on the ground, and rushes to his home. He finds that his suspicions are confirmed: his wife and younger child Ray Jr. have disappeared with the rest. Rayford searches for answers at the church that he had never before enjoyed attending with his wife. He finds the assistant pastor Bruce Barnes, who has been left behind, at the church, watching a video recorded by the church's pastor, describing THE VERY EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED. <br />The video tells of the disappearances predicted in the Bible, the path to salvation, and foretells of the events to come, according to the Bible. Rayford, his daughter Chloe, Bruce, and a small congregation of others searching for answers find their salvation in Jesus Christ. <br />Meantime, Buck Williams searches for answers too, as he watches a charismatic Romanian leader rise quickly to the head of the United Nations. He learns from Bruce Barnes' teaching that this leader is predicted in the Bible, and in the video tape. Buck must discover the truth for himself, before it is too late.<br />BAD:<br />I enjoy this series a lot, but for those whose theology doesn't line up, it's not an extremely critical aspect of the Christian life as to what manner Christ will return in. The authors, Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye rely on the Bible for their opinions, and the Bible makes it clear that Christ's return is imminent, and that it will occur \\"in the twinkling of an eye\\". Even if you don't agree with the pre-tribulation Rapture of Christ's church, this series is still quite enjoyable. Compared to some books I've read, this particular one isn't very violent, but for picky readers, you should know that there are some violent things that take place in the book: a double-murder described in rather gory detail, as well as the chaos and violence that occurs following the disappearances. (Drivers who disappear cannot stop their cars from plowing into houses, people, cars; people cooking on a stove that disappear leave burnings stoves behind them; even other airline pilots who disappear leave their passengers pilotless, to crash and burn)<br />GOOD:<br />Jesus Christ is the Messiah, that's the main message of this book. Those who were raptured were taken by God to be spared his great wrath and judgment. Many come to repentance, and faith in Him after the disappearances, and follow His leading thereafter. This book is very enjoyable to read, and it's quite the craze nowadays too.<br />THOUGHTS: <BR>Jenkins' writing style isn't the best you can find, to be honest. It's the plot that keeps you enthralled. In fact, some of his writing skills seem to deteriorate in later books of this series. Still, the book is a good read, and you should read it some time. But be prepared to buy a boxed set, or perhaps the rest of the series, because you'll want to know what happens next, and there's 12 books in the series! Also check out the Left Behind movies, and the dramatic audio editions.	2003-04-30
US	37321260	R1LJ1EH2X0LVQX	0310227550	147350438	The Face of God	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Good, but violent	When Daniel Lawson's wife Jill is killed by a mysterious intruder while the couple are hosting a Holy Land tour from their large church in America, Pastor Lawson loses the center of his existence. He's not quite lost his faith in God, but is heartbroken that God would take her away. Her last words haunt him; that she must go, it's \\"the only way\\". Those and the earlier words spoken to him by his gracious wife, that he did not love the people of God anymore.<br />Daniel begins a quest to learn the truth behind the mysterious stone that was given them by a market trader at the last minute. It's old, it's strange . . . and it's potentially the reason why Jill was killed. He is joined by his estranged son Tyler, and interested  archaeologist Helen Zimmerman. A native Muslim girl named Nayra joins them as well, offering her knowledge of the region in their search. God blesses their mission, and they are successful many times. But Daniel is also haunted by dreams, the same type of dreams that his wife mentioned the night before she died - and the same dreams that seem to be caused by the stones. <br />At the same time Daniel's quest is progressing, another man is on a hunt for the stones. Ibrahim El-Magd is a devout Muslim, and he believes that Allah's time has come. He has positioned many members of his radical group around the world to engage in \\"Allah's Day\\" of judgment and cleansing. He too has learned of the stones, and has experienced dreams. He, too searches for more of the mysterious stones, in hopes that his dreams will be fulfilled, and that he will also see . . . The Face of God.<br />BAD POINTS: This book is a violent book, no question there. In fact, author Bill Myers requests that any reader under 17 delay reading it until he or she is a little older. That's an NC-17 rating, folks. If it were made into a movie, with today's lax rating standards, it would probably only warrant an R rating, but it's still rather intense. Violence includes the cutting off of a Muslim boy's hand as punishment for stealing, a few deaths by gunshots (including Jill Lawson's), and a nighttime raid on a Christian group in a Muslim country. One soldier proceeds to disrobe a young girl, and uses his sword to cut off her . . . well, her feminine aspects, okay? There's also a few [love] references: Helen uses her womanhood to gain favors from government agents, and various small-time indications.<br />GOOD POINTS: The book is written from a Christian perspective, in case you haven't noticed yet. Daniel believes in God, and tries his best to follow Him. Each Stone he uncovers, however, teaches him something that he has somehow lost sight off, and helps him see his wrongdoing. There is a lot of material about the Muslim world versus the Christian world. In fact, for most of the book, it appears as if Myers \\"goes soft\\" on Muslims by indicating that they are men of devout faith, not entirely unlike believers in Christ. Perhaps, it appears, they are even more devout, as they strive to be holy more than Christians. The words \\"politically correct\\" come to mind. But all this is wrapped up very nicely in the end, really. It's just something to watch out for. <br />THOUGHTS:<br />Myers states in his introduction that he finished this book on September 11th, so you can tell as you go through it that it took some re-editing on his part to graft references to such events. Things like \\"ever since the victory of 9/11, the enemy had been bombing more frequently\\" and things like that.<br />The book is a good read for Christian fiction enthusiasts, but do watch out for the violent content.	2003-04-29
US	37321260	R20WY2BVXY57XL	157673708X	841143566	The Veritas Conflict	Books	5	16	16	N	N	Amazing book	The plot is rather complicated, but here's the gist: Claire Rivers is a Christian student who begins attending Harvard. She is ill-prepared for the secular environment, and the hostile attacks against her Christian faith, and the \\"tolerant\\" society that rejects and criticizes her views violently. She manages to make friends with other Christians on campus, including Brad, a member of the Christian fellowship group at Harvard, and Professor Mansfield, the lovable teacher of history, and a fellow Christian. Although she is a freshman, she is drawn by God into difficult deeds: assisting Mansfield and his TA Ian in a special research project that may reveal results devastating to the secular, humanist faculty at Harvard. Trying to be the accountability \\"officer\\" to her roommate Sherry, who first welcomes and requests the effort, then grows angry with, and rejects them. Things get shaky when some attempts are made to stop the research project. Claire came to Harvard to study, but finds herself chosen as one of God's front soldiers in . . . The Veritas Conflict.<br />In the world that Claire cannot see, angels chosen by God protect her against the enemy territory of the demon spirits. <br />The book is an excellent read. It took me a while to finish it, but it was worth it. The message of Christ shines clearly through the book without anyone having to preach at the reader; it merely takes place in the \\"everyday\\" life of the Harvard students. The debates that Claire and her friends find themselves engaged in are incredibly well-crafted, realistic, and enjoyable to read. <br />Are there any bad points? Well, just in case there are parents wanting to know, I'd rate this book PG, because there are some death scenes (one of `em will have you cryin' your eyes out) and a kidnapping, and vague descriptions of Satanic practices. There's also a few sexual references: one point where a man visits a porn magazine headquarters and views the girl while she is being photographed, and one point where a young girl caves to pressure and sleeps with her boyfriend. All this, of course, is painted in the BAD light as it should be, but it's all still rather suggestive to the imagination.<br />My advice is, take your time on this book. It's 446 pages long, and the print is nice and SMALL. It'll take you a little while to get through it, but it will be worth it in the end. And besides, who could resist a book by an author with such a cool name as Shaunti Feldhahn?	2003-04-20

Bush. It, as Woodward says in the end, was changed when foreign terrorists hijacked those planes and plunged into the World Trade Center towers.<br />I posted my first review while reading the book, and now that I've finally finished reading, I thought I'd share further/final thoughts on the book.<br />It's fascinating to learn all about the events that went on behind the scenes of our nation's leaders on that day that many of us remember all too well. Woodward interviewed many of the high-level, high-profile leaders, including Condoleezza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld, and even President Bush. Thus, this is probably the most accurate and detailed description available to the public today about the events of September 11th, and the following events.<br />On the other hand, you'd think that reading about those events would be exciting. I'm sure the events that took place weren't exactly that electrifying, but the way it's put down on paper makes it seem quite dull and dry. And once the war in Afghanistan begins, it's a jumble of names and places within the Afghan region that is just too hard to keep up with, at least for the readers who aren't knowledgeable about the region.<br />Still, it's a great refresher for what the chain of events were following that terrible day in September. For certain it's a great book to keep on the shelf and take down when you get old, and your grandkids ask you to tell them about what it was like to live through 9/11 and the war that followed.<br />As I warned, however, in my previous review, this book does contain profanity, used by the higher-ups in stressful situations, including the term FUBAR. I read in another book that this term meant Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition, but . . . well, let's just say there was a less wholesome word in the F position.<br />A few last notes. While the book was supposed to be about Bush, it did windup being about how our nation as a WHOLE handled the war, as another reviewer pointed out. Second, this book is NOT about politics.

Well, for the big Left Behind fans, not too much could be bigger than for Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye to come out with their second-to-last book in their now-famous Left Behind series.<br />Jenkins, the primary writer of the series, doesn't disappoint, plunging into action from right where he left off in his previous novel, The Remnant. Rayford Steele executes an attempted rescue mission to rescue imbedded spy Chang Wong, in the midst of a God-sent plague of Darkness upon the camp of the enemy. The rest of the Tribulation Force is scattered and divided. The antichrist, his kingdom shrouded in darkness, is stepping up efforts to root out the Remnant of his enemies, the faithful Christians around the world.<br />New friends and old perish as the heat is cranked up. Armies are prepared for the great battle of Armageddon. The protected thousands at Petra thrive, and receive new members daily. The Tribulation Force personally suffers tragic losses as the world plummets towards . . . Armageddon.<br />I've never been a fan of Jerry B. Jenkins' writing STYLE per se, but his plots are riveting, and his story very thrilling, so that holds the reader to it. His new word this book is eschew, by the way. Jerry Jenkins, the avid Scrabble player, usually sticks a new word in his books for you to learn, and I noticed this new one at least three times.<br />And I don't care what Jerry Jenkins says about not killing characters in his writing, but merely \\"finding them dead\\". The ending of this book, and the death scenes elsewhere were obviously carefully thought-over and planned. Jenkins kills his characters with little emotion; he's a cold, calculating killer, that's what I say. ;-)<br />I suppose it is of note that the death scenes of the book hardly caused any change in emotion for me. It was just \\"Oh it's SO-SO who dies this time.\\"<br />Regardless, this book is bound to bring a sense of sadness to avid readers, as it is the second-to-last. Faithful readers will no doubt find it hard once the series ends, but then again, we all want to know what happens to the characters. Jenkins has his work cut out for him for book 12, Glorious Appearing.	2003-04-12

The reader follows him as he tries to tame himself from his street/bully life and hopefully to become the son of his adopted mother, Mrs. Bennet. <br />Enter his rich but unknown aunt, who sends for him from her rich estate in California, sight unseen. Scruggs is quite reluctant to leave his newfound home, but he swallows his fear of flying and journeys to her home.<br />He finds himself wrapped up in a world where money can buy anything...and does. Who is the mysterious face peering through his window? Why is his aunt so mysterious? Who is The Juggler a mysterious note warns him of? Scruggs arrived, figuring on finding a rich aunt...but he finds himself playing A Dangerous Game instead.<br />This book doesn't deliver as much as the others did. The writing style is rather terse (not that it's BAD), and the character isn't as enjoyable to read about. Scruggs seems to be a little too smart/clever in his dealings with his fighting opponents, and those who are after him. I'm sorry, but I enjoyed reading more about Jack and Penny Derwood's misadventures than I do Scruggs'. Still, it IS admittedly a cool book.	2003-04-06

The story of a young man named Scott who found himself in the world you probably already know a little about, since you're looking up this book: Marus. <br />Confused and bewildered, he joins company with Draven, an individual who bears the mark of one chosen by the Unseen One as His servant: eyes of two different colors. <br />Scott eventually learns from Draven that, by the power of the Unseen One, judgment has been handed out on Marus in the form of time standing still. It is Perpetually Autumn, grass does not grow, people do not age. It is judgment against the apostate leader, Mobeck, and his wicked queen Skalaw. Scott finds himself headed, along with Draven, for a showdown with the corrupt leaders to vie for the hearts of the peoples of Marus. Will Scott join with Draven's Defiance?<br />Another very enjoyable tale about the fictional world of Marus, weaved by Adventures in Odyssey's Paul McCusker. It tells the Biblical story of Elijah in a refreshing way, a new environment that makes the story come to life anew. There's a few new spins on this story (Draven escapes with Scott on a motorcycle, and the judgment handed out is different from the God's No-Rain judgment in the Bible. A famine, however is a consequence of time standing still)<br />Another great read by the same great author, and I consider it worth the money. My only regret is that there are only six in this series.	2003-04-04

My sister actually had it for a year or so before I read it. This is one of the Peabody series, but it operates on its own as well, so you don't have to read the others first or anything.<br />The plot is, Jack Derwood has an offer to go with his uncle on a fact-finding trip in the Yukon. Allegedly, a long-dead crook buried treasure there, and they want to find it. Jack invites his bully-turned-friend Scruggs to come along, and, along with other party members, they begin their venture to find The Treasure of the Yukon.<br />The book is surprisingly believable, well-written, and fun to read. While giving the feel of being back in the days of live-on-your-own-means, fighting outlaws and recovering stolen treasure, it is not at all unbelievable or fanciful. In fact, I thought it was rather cool, especially the end. But you'll have to read it for yourself.	2003-04-02

This is the story of Jack and Penny Derwood, brother and sister, who live in a mixed family of six kiddos altogether, and the misadventures they wind up having have.<br />The situations they encounter prove quite humorous, dangerous, and entertaining in either case. Whether escaping smugglers in an deserted warehouse, or catering to the Ladies' Auxiliary Missionary Fellowship Annual Luncheon Meeting while their mom is sick in the hospital, you'll certainly be amused and entertained. <br />This is actually two books in one, but for whatever reason, perhaps because the two are sort-of connected, they were blended. The style is enjoyable, the characters are well-developed, and I give the whole book high marks overall. It's a great read!	2003-03-30

First, to all the guys out there, I should say that I didn't know this was a girly book. :-) Actually, it's not really. The main character is a girl, though, and the book is seen first-person through her eyes. <br />Hope is 16, cared for by her aunt after her mother left her, and a waitress alongside her aunt, who is the cook. When the diner she works in shuts down, she moves with her aunt to Wisconsin to work in the diner there. The cheery proprietor G.T., however, makes a startling announcement that he's challenging the corrupt current mayor of the town in an election. Hope finds herself handing out eggs over easy alongside campaign signs as she throws in her efforts behind G.T. Things get rough on the campaign trail, and Hope continues to meet new friends, all the time trying to live up to her name for the citizens of the town.<br />I thought it was an interesting read. I just found this book lying on our table one day, picked it up, read a few pages, enjoyed the style, kept reading. Liked the characters and descriptions and kept reading. Finished the book...still wanting to keep reading. It's just a nice story, not at all a fantasy, but not a dark, depressing tale either. <br />There's a few cases of what might be thought of as taking God's name in vain, but God is acknowledged as the source of strength for G.T. as well. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and I think you will too.	2003-03-27

This was one of the first novels I read, and I really enjoyed it.<br />This book chronicles the small college town of Ashton, and its struggling pastor Hank Busche, and local journalist Marshall Hogan. Unseen by them is the whole cool part of the story: Tal, Captain of Hosts of the Armies of God is leading a defense of the town from an attempted take-over by head demon Rafar, and his cohorts. <br />The plot is more complicated than that, but that's the gist of it. <br />Many people disagree with the theology of this book: humans having direct impact on the angel-demon wars by rebuking the demons by name...names, by the way, such as Lust, Fear, and Hate. It does bring the spiritual warfare side a little closer, and make you want to prayer more, but not too many people believe in this kind of conflict. But the Bible does tell us that our struggle is against the powers of darkness in the heavenly realms.<br />It's a great action-read, and is also full of spiritual insight and teaching.	2003-03-26

In this book, Josh Harris explores the months before his own relationship, in which he put into practice the principles he published in his first book.<br />I can't tell you all of what he wrote, but I must say that employing these principles, following God's design for your life rather than chasing after the newest boyfriend/girlfriend, can certainly improve your life.<br />My opinion: read I Kissed Dating Goodbye first, and then check this one out.	2003-03-20

Tolkien Boxed Set (The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings)	Books	5	3	4	N	N	The quintessential book set of the beloved Tolkien trilogy	First, a note on the quality of the set itself. This is just a simple boxed set, paperback cover, no illustrations or anything, just the quintessential set for someone who wants to read the books. This set also includes The Hobbit, the prequel that actually started the whole thing. Return of the King, volume III, DOES contain the appendixes, by the way.<br />As for the book material itself, it's very difficult to describe the wonder and awe of the fantasy series by J.R.R. Tolkien. Tolkien weaves a fantastic tale of fantasy, adventure, and suspense that strikes a chord in anyone. The \\"Tookish\\" side that makes anyone want to travel, to journey, to have adventures and see or commit brave acts of valor.<br />The basic plot is Frodo Baggins, simple hobbit (if you don't know what hobbits are, you either need to forget reading these books or start reading immediately! :) ) from the peaceful land of The Shire inherits a simple Ring from his uncle, Bilbo Baggins. Through the counsel of Gandalf the Grey, traveling wizard and friend of the hobbit-kind, Frodo comes to know that this is more than just a Ring. It is The One Ring. The Ruling Ring forged by the Dark Lord Sauron ages ago. Taken in battle, the Ring passed through different owners, almost all of whom have given in to its evil influence. Hobbits, however, though small in stature have extraordinary resilience to such evils. Frodo takes the Ring, and bears it away from The Shire, along with his four hobbit friends Sam, Merry and Pippin. He joins parties with Strider the Ranger, who assists in a conflict with the Nazgûl, the dark phantom servants of the Dark Lord, whose sole purpose is to recover the Ring for Sauron, that He may again rule all lands in darkness.<br />The company reaches the protected stronghold of Elves, Rivendell. There is take counsel, where The Fellowship of the Ring is formed. Great conflict lies ahead in the land of Middle-Earth, and you'll just have to buy this set to find out what happens!<br />Now a major motion picture trilogy from New Line Cinema, these books and the movie give wings for the imagination to soar into worlds far away, to dreams of heroes, conflict, beauty, grandeur, fantasy.a major motion picture trilogy from New Line Cinema, these books and the movie give wings for the imagination to soar into worlds far away, to dreams of heroes, conflict, beauty, grandeur, fantasy.	2003-03-20

There's some magnificent pictures from the second installment in New Line's The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's the whole movie plot simplified.<br />But this book is only worth something before the movie. Afterward, it just loses its luster. Since you've already seen the movie, why look at the pictures again?<br />Nonetheless, there are some interesting items that take place in the book that give some hints as to what some extended material for The Two Towers' extended release will be. (For instance, the plot line about Aragorn releasing Theodred's horse Brego, which rescues him in the movie after the Warg battle. In the movie, the horse just showed up, without prior mention of it)<br />There's also (at least in ours) a page of stickers in the back of the book, but since there's only one to a character, no one wants to remove them from the page.	2003-03-17

Only it's not Prince Charming and a beautiful princess to rescue...it's a Queen marrying a foreign king.

US	37321260	R3ECRR6CHR17XL	0310218039	810531498	Eli	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Interesting concept by a good fiction writer	Bill Myers has a great plot going here: What would happen if Jesus Christ did NOT come two thousand years ago? What if he came to earth today...in this world...as we know it now?<br />Of course, Bill Myers makes the concession in his preface, stating that the world as we know it would not even exist without Christ's existence. For instance, how do they measure time? A.D. and B.C. certainly won't work. But of course, there's absolutely no knowing what this world would be like without Christ's visit. So, Myers accepts this fact, and moves on.<br />Introducing Conrad Davis. A successful news reporter who is studying the concept of parallel worlds for a news article. A theory exists that other worlds are out there, millions and trillions of them; each just a little like this one, and yet each a little different. One small decision may be made differently in this world, which causes a whole new history to be written. Suppose you arrive at an intersection. You turn left, and arrive home. But if you turn right, you crash into someone's car, and this person happens to be a city councilman. He misses a meeting as the result, and the counsel votes on something without him which changes the whole town's ordinance. There's no such thing as a small decision. And in one world, you turned left and got home, and in another you turned right the world split to accommodate for both actions.<br />This is the theory that Myers operates on, and it works beautifully. Instead of fish and bread passed out for the Miraculous catch of fish, it's kids' meal burgers and fries. Instead of ministering to the tax collectors, \\"Eli\\" goes to a Playboy-type mansion. Instead of helping disciples catch fish, he helps them by tipping them off about a baseball pitch.<br />It's a brilliant work, and certainly worth reading. My only complaint is that the characters are slightly under-developed...his descriptions are a little lacking, and his style of writing is rather terse and straight-forward. Otherwise,it's a great read!<br />One question: If there ARE millions of worlds...which one is the real one?	2003-03-01

If one takes the trouble of examining the nightly news with a fine-toothed comb, one can easily see the liberal bias that Goldberg refers to. (Of course, being a member of the Limbaugh Institute for Advanced Conservative Studies also helps!) The liberal news casters are slanted in their views, and it definitely impacts their news reports. <br />Of course one cannot help but have an opinion on a subject; that's not what Goldberg is talking about. It's when the opinion affects the \\"objective\\" news reporting and favors the democratic version of an issue that you get biased news.<br />One thing I must pick at in this book is the foul language. I don't like foul language in anything, so just to warn you: a few D- and H-words, as well as at least one F-word. <br />Nightly news is quickly going out of style anyway, and FOX News's ratings have never been better...America is realizing Goldberg is right - and the liberal news is Left...and Biased.	2003-02-16

But he just couldn't help it, and some good stuff got put in there anyway!<br />Kurt Bruner and Jim Ware's book attempts to highlight some of the positive attributes of Tolkien's Rings trilogy, but sadly fall short, in my opinion. There's discussion of happiness, contentedness, loyalty, all that stuff. But the book ends there, having discussed only these &quot;nice&quot; qualities. <br />In my opinion, God can be found in much deeper ways in LotR than just the positive human goodness. One of the analogies that I've heard brought out of the books is the fact that Frodo, Gandalf and Aragorn constitute the Priest, Prophet and King, the three offices of Christ. (Frodo bears the Sin [Ring] away from the others, Gandalf can obviously be thought of as a prophet, and Aragorn as the King)<br />There are many other analogies that one can find, if one examines closely, the works of Tolkien, and this book only scratches the surface. I sure hope someone else writes a more in-depth look at the books so everybody doesn't lump The Lord of the Rings and Chronicles of Narnia in with Harry Potter and stuff like that...there is a difference!	2003-02-09

The Silmarillion is for die-hard Tolkien fans, there's no doubt about it. It reads much like a Bible for Middle-Earth, but can help create an in-depth understanding of the background of Middle-Earth. Though there's few names you'd recognize from the Rings trilogy itself, (Elrond and Galadriel are probably the ones you would readily recognize) you can understand a lot more of the trilogy itself if you read this. <br />You can get a better grasp on many of the poems and expressions used, such as in the first book, the Fellowship, Elrond says something to the effect of \\"Though you sit among Turin or Beren, you would be honored among them.\\" or some of the poetry regarding Beren and Luthien. <br />It's actually tough reading, and at times boring, but overall it's kind of fun.	2003-02-09

The sixth and last of Paul McCusker's Passages series. This time, it is three young kids who enter Marus. Immediately split apart, Michelle finds herself in the palace of the Palatian king, and due to her eyes (eyes of different colors mean a messenger from the Unseen One) she is made an advisor to the King. <br />Danny and Wayne find themselves in the company of a ragtag rebel of the kingdom named Fendar, who is returned from exile to crusade for the Marusians' freedom. <br />Somehow, this book seems longer than the other five, but no less fun to read. An excellent re-telling of the story of Moses from the Old Testament. The book brings the story to life for young and old, and is a good buy for anyone. Once again, these books touch the \\"other worlds\\" lobe of the brain that makes us relish stories like Lord of the Rings, Narnia, and of course, Fendar's Legacy.	2003-02-09

It's a super-cool family of archeologists--minus a mother--who investigate phenomena in the spirit of Indiana Jones, only with a Christian perspective.

This is one of the toughest battles the Coopers have had to fight before...can they survive The Deadly Curse of Toco-Rey?<br />The book is cool, but loads of creepy stuff. There's a lot action too. Definitely lives up to the Cooper Kids genre that Peretti has going.<br />Parental Warning: Almost Indiana Jones stuff here. Skeletons are everywhere, deadly, raving diseased people, Hostile Natives (of COURSE they'd have hostile natives!) and nasty \\"carvies\\". Pretty intense, but pretty cool.	2003-02-08

I absolutely love Paul McCusker's Passages books. I've been a fan of the Adventures in Odyssey program for years, and this book can function with or without prior Odyssey experience.<br />Young James finds himself in another world, and soon rescuing a young boy from his brothers. No sooner does he rescue him than the brothers return, and sell them both as slaves! James and Glennal soon discover they've been given a unique ability...together they can have visions of future events, by the power of the Unseen One. (God) They attempt to use their gift to help, but soon much more than their freedom depends on them!!<br />Like I've said before, the Passages series grabs the brain lobe that loves the fantasy adventures of journeys to other worlds much like Narnia, or Middle-Earth. Lots of fun, and lots of learning too.<br />For the parents: Glennal and James encounter rough treatment in slavery, and one man dies a violent death in a labor camp. Another is implied executed (with a graphic vision about it beforehand)	2003-02-07

Jay Cooper has been struck blind on board his uncle's plane due to airplane turbulence. Now, with the help of ground crew, family, friends, and relatives he must attempt to keep his unconscious uncle alive and land safely...all while he is Flying Blind.<br />This book appears to be the last of the Cooper kids adventure series, sadly. It's not as grand as some of the other novels, like I said, but it's still worth reading.<br />For the parents: A pretty tame book, compared to the others. Jay gets whacked on the head and bleeds a little. That's it.	2003-02-06

I can count on one hand the Foxtrot comic strips that have failed to make me laugh...every one of them is funny. If you have a funny bone, you should tickle it by buying this book...and checking into other Foxtrot books.<br />For the parents: Being a teen myself, I thought I'd stick a note in case there are any parents out there, getting this for kids. Amend is somewhat disappointing on occasion. Example, in one comic, Peter Fox has a dream of making out with two Sports Illustrated models, who are in (cartoon, of course) skimpy suits. The two suggest they take the suits off, but Peter is awakened in the next panel. Kind of an appeal to the carnal side, but I try to ignore it. Most of the rest of the strips are just fine.	2003-02-04

He finds himself in the shelter of a man named Arin. After being cared for by Arin and his family, Arin tells Wade that it has been revealed to him by the Unseen One (Who is known in our world as God) that there would be a great judgment because of the wickedness of the Marusians. Arin doesn't know what it will be, but the final sign before the disaster would be the appearance of a blond-haired boy. Blond hair doesn't exist in Marus. Wade goes against Arin's warning, and ventures out into the danger of Marus beyond Arin's compound walls. He finds himself captured, and taken before a man who wishes to further the sciences of Marus - no matter what the cost. Soon Wade finds himself in the middle of political controversy, and a tyrant's rule, all the while trying to escape...Arin's Judgment.<br />I really enjoyed Paul McCusker's Passages series...there's some sort of part of the human brain that relishes stories of other worlds, be it Narnia or Middle-Earth. This, added with the wonderful re-telling of the story of Noah make this book a cool read.<br />For the parents: I'm only a teenager myself, so I figure I should let any parents know whether or not their kids would want to read this. Of course, there's some graphic stuff that happens...there's some description of the plague that hits Marus, a palace is blown up, a man is killed by the flaming shards (and implied that several more are), a boy has a dream of skeletal figures attacking him...some stuff like this might make some people sensitive to that kind of thing hesitant, but I thought they were pretty cool myself...and it's only as violent as your imagination lets you think of.	2003-02-02

I'd never heard of him until I heard this drama. It's historical, and masterfully done by the crew at Radio Theater and Focus on the Family. Definitely worth listening to.<br />For the parents: I'd definitely suggest you listen along with younger children...in the beginning as a precursor to the drama, and then in the end, in the actual drama, Bonhoeffer is led to the execution, read his sentence, and then, as you hear Dietrich's panicked breathing, the trapdoor falls, the rope goes taunt, and you can hear the weight of a body swinging back and forth from the gallows. An intense scene for youngsters. But history is history, and that's what happened.<br />Very dramatic, very worth listening to.	2003-02-02

When Wildlife Professor Steve Benson's brother is grotesquely killed in the mountains near Hyde River, Steve attempts to find out who - or what - killed him. But Hyde River doesn't want him prying around in their town, nor does the big man in town, Harold Bly. A descendant of the town's original founders, he carries a certain weight and authority in town. Before Steve knows it, he's gotten in way over his head, in more ways than one, and he must stay in town to discover how to get out of it. . . and the original speakers of The Oath.<br />I've read all of Peretti's novels except \\"Tilly\\", and I didn't enjoy The Oath as much. There isn't the type of spiritual Angel-Demon combat such as in his Darkness novels, but there's still spiritual conflict to a certain degree. But this novel is so much more dark, the characters (especially the main character) a little more shady, and the whole book has a more secular feel to it. There's several implied sexual references: Steve watches a gal skinny dip in a lake, people in the town have affairs out the wazzoo, there's two minor characters who are implied prostitutes, and Steve and the gal eventually wake up in bed together...and we can safely assume from the following discussions that they went to sleep with each other too. <br />The book is just a lot more carnal that the Peretti we're used to...especially since the protagonist isn't actually a good guy. The book also contains various and sundry amounts of creepiness, gore and violence. (Literally, people are devoured, killed, shot, blown up, etc) Now that I think about it, there's actually a case or two where bad characters take God's name in vain. The Oath has all the makings of a PG-13 Hollywood movie, but that's not always what we want in Christian suspense thrillers like Peretti writes. <br />In summary, you'll probably want to read this book anyway, just because it's from Peretti, but if you do, try to read it BEFORE you read his best work, The Visitation.	2003-02-01

Each is quickly caught up in the action from different sides, while trying to figure out what in the world happened. They soon discover they're under the protection of the Unseen One, known in our world as God. <br />I began reading this book, and I honestly couldn't put it down; fortunately, it was on a weekend! It's pretty awesome, because instead of a slingshot, Darien uses a pocket knife. Instead of a sword, Darien uses a pistol and a saber. Marus is in a Western type of time frame for this story, and that is one thing that helps this book to work so well.<br />I'm already a fan of Focus on the Family's Adventures in Odyssey, and this book contains some elements of the series, but it can function on its own, for sure.<br />If you like this one (and I can almost promise you will), you'll want to check out the other five titles.	2003-02-01

Dr. Cooper is suspicious, and carefully investigates. What he encounters is not at all what he expected!

Their Christian beliefs are challenged, their lives threatened, and their strength tested before the books end. And you won't believe the ending. It's...out of this world. ;)<br />It's an action-packed mini-novel for kids, and even grown-ups, if they are so inclined. There's action, suspense, intrigue, and some scary stuff too! And you gotta love Dr. Coopers .357!<br />Here's a little parental warning though, in case you are wondering what kind of stuff might be inappropriate for younger kiddos. The group come across some skeletons of past searchers, and there is a VERY intense scene at the end...but I read them when I was only 10, and it didn't give me any nightmares.<br />Excellent novels, with great Christian morals packed in too.

After being captured by the creepy Yahrrim, the local tribesmen who live in fear of their god, meeting their prophetess, Marah, and encountering a rough and mysterious desert rogue they are finally forced to enter. . .The Tombs of Anak. <br />Riddles, action, suspense, and coolness are loaded to the gills in this book, just great for young people who want to read some cool stuff without the junk and gore of Illinois Jones, or whatever.

He comes up with the greatest plots, keeps you in the dark until the end, and crafts his story in the most imaginative ways. It's just like a regular movie plot, with Peretti's Christianity keeping close beside.<br />The Visitation is his finest work yet, taking into account his Darkness novels, as well as The Oath and The Prophet. You probably already know the basics of the plot...Travis Jordan, a pastor in the small town of Antioch Washington begins noticing the strange, allegedly miraculous events occurring around town. People of the town that he knows suddenly show up healed from all of their handicaps and giving the credit to Jesus. Then he receives a phone call from the healer. Before he knows it, he (and, since this is Peretti's first \\"First Person\\" perspective novel, so is the reader) is caught up in a chaotic present, a dubious future, and a painful past all at once.<br />Peretti wastes no time, catching your attention from the very beginning of the book. As with most novels, there is a period of calmness that, if you are an impatient reader, you must work through to get to the action, but don't you dare skip! You'll miss crucial elements of the story. However, I've yet to meet an impatient reader that didn't enjoy Peretti.<br />We gradually discover lots more about Travis Jordan, the protagonist of the book, through a series of flashbacks starting when Travis was at college, and leading up to his present situation. You gotta keep track of everything that happens, but it's worth it in the end.<br />Peretti incorporates something a lot different in this book than he has tried before...humor. This is the first book of Peretti's I've read that was so cool, and still so funny at times. Peretti has found a wonderful gift of inserting little tidbits of comedy here and there that provide tasty spice for the book. Example, we know that Frank Peretti once lived in a camper, so when he writes about the portable toilet that was first installed in the church of the story, you can tell he relies on personal experience.<br />And wouldn't you know it, Peretti can't stay away from towns that go bonkers, and this book is no exception. Ever since The Oath he's enjoyed doing that, it must be some sort of fantasy of his.<br />The plot, mystery, and characters thicken, the action intensifies, and the enjoyment peaks in this book.

Perhaps a little over-perfect, but one can overlook that. <br />The dialogue is pretty cool, especially when the Springfield kids square off with students and teachers in an Evolution vs. Creation debate, using some pretty witty dialogue<br />Peretti's theme applies to young kids today, as well as paralleling his own childhood experiences.

I gradually realized however, that it was SUPPOSED to be confusing, because anyone that was whisked away from Earth and ended up in a cave in a foreign land WOULD be confused.<BR>Here we have Nick Seagrave, a man who, we learn as we go along, has had quite a rough, self-centered life.

He meets a group of people led by an eccentric, and generally unpleasant man named Shadrach, journeying on the Red Road. They encourage him to join them, and as he does, he learns about himself, his life, and reflects on what kind of man he's been. He also discovers more about the Chasm, the great pit that he comes across, and ultimately discovers mercy from the Chasm-Crosser.<br />It definitely helps to think of this as today's Pilgrim's Progress rather than a novel. It's an excellent allegory, and gives one a taste of the life that can be, and the life that one can escape. It has excellent parallels for today's Christian life, and gives a taste what the Christian life SHOULD be about from the standpoint of a man who has had bad experiences with the church. It makes Jesus, the Chasm-Crosser become REAL, shows His REAL mercy, his true love, and his REAL compassion in a very REAL way.<br />It has certainly made me want to strive all the more to serve the true King of this world, the one that loved me enough to die for me, just as much as he loves you enough to die for you.<br />I highly recommend it for any reader.	2002-09-01
