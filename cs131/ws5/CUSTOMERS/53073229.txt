I have worked professionally with author Robert Bolton and his associates. I have published a book about effective thinking and communication  which includes learnings from Bolton.<br /><br />  Except for \\"Peoplemaking\\" by Virginia Satir, this is the most practical, comprehensive, and insightful book I have found for people seeking to improve the effectiveness of their communications, relationships, and personal serenity.<br /><br />  This book would be even more useful if Bolton included:<br /><br />1) that the aim of communication (behavior) is to fill current primary needs - so clear awareness of your and any partner's needs is essential;<br /><br />2) the reality that human behavior (including communicating) is inexorably shaped by the subselves that compose our personalities. Therefore, the first step in improving communication outcomes is to become aware of and harmonize our subselves. An effective way to do this is \\"Inner-family therapy.\\" Without doing this, most readers will be unable to follow Bolton's helpful suggestions.<br /><br />3) the learnable skills of \\"awareness\\" and \\"digging down\\" are essential requisites for the five skills Bolton describes;<br /><br />4) the concept of \\"R(elationship) messages\\" that all kids and adults unconsciously decode from each other. These multimedia messages are among the most powerful factors affecting the outcome any communication interchange, yet few people are aware of them. And \\"People Skills\\" would be better if it integrated...<br /><br />5) the effects of human *gender* on communication priorities, perceptions, and outcomes. See \\"You Just Don't Understand,\\" by linguist Barbara Tannen, and \\"Brain Sex,\\" by Anne Moir and David Jessel.<br /><br />  My book adds these factors to Bolton's concepts: \\"Satisfactions - 7 relationship skills you need to know\\" (xlibris.com, 2002).<br /><br />For a free online self-study course on improving your communication skills, see [...]your communication skills, see [...]	2004-09-20

My conclusion about \\"creating your life from the inside out\\" is very different from McGraw's. He makes no mention of the observable reality that the lives of average people from troubled childhoods (i.e. most of us) are governed by a group of personality \\"subselves\\" who often are disorganized and conflicted.<br /><br />This can change, if people become interested in freeing their resident true Self (capital \\"S\\") to harmonize their other subselves. Hundreds of practicing clinicians around the country help people do this via \\"Internal Family Systems\\" therapy.<br /><br />McGraw's ideas sound practical and useful, build hope, and DO promote healthy self-awareness. However, I suspect that most people will be unable to benefit significantly from his suggestions because they're unaware that their lives are often ruled by false selves. This is one explanation for vexing compulsions, why most diets don't work, widespread trouble keeping New Year's resolutions, and often doing self-harmful things \\"anyway.\\" ...<br /><br />For more perspective, see these:<br /><br />[...]and it's textbook [...]]	2004-09-17

I do not recommend the book for readers who want to reduce the wounds from the low-nurturance childhood that usually precedes legal or psychological parental divorce.<br /><br />Like most authors focusing on divorce-prevention, recovery, and (re)marriage, Jen Abbas seems unaware of the effects of four vital factors:<br /><br />1) the origin and impacts of six psychological wounds from childhood (vs. divorce). Most divorced parents and children  appear to be significantly wounded - and don't (want to) know it;<br /><br />2) the origin and impacts of blocked grief in adults and kids, and how to spot and reduce it;<br /><br />3) typical adults' unawareness of, and/or indifference to, (a) normal personality formation, composition, and function; (b) keys to high-nurturance families and relationships, (c) effective communication skills, and (d) healthy 3-level grief.<br /><br />In my clinical experience, these factors will combine to ptrrevent most people from following heartfelt advice such as Abbas offers her readers. For example, \\"learn how to trust\\" is a legitimate suggestion - and most children of divorce will be unable to *do* that, unless they work at harmonizing the combative, reactive parts of their personality.<br /><br />For more perspective, see these these articles:<br /><br />[...]	2004-09-11

The single reservation I have about this book is that the author makes no mention of several factors that will hinder typical readers from following her practical advice. Like most authors in this genre, she omits:<br /><br />1) why and how to assess and reduce co-parents' psychological wounds from childhood (vs. divorce). Most divorced and stepfamily adults appear to be significantly wounded - and don't (want to) know it;<br /><br />2) the origin and impacts of blocked grief in adults and kids, and how to spot and reduce it;<br /><br />3) co-parent unawareness of - and indifference to - five key topics: (a) normal personality formation, composition, and function; (b) keys to high-nurturance families and relationships, (c) effective communication skills, (d) healthy 3-level grief, and (e) stepfamily realities, norms, implications, and hazards. And...<br /><br />4) the implications of little effective re/marital and co-parenting help (i.e. courtship coaching, classes, informed counseling, co-parent support groups) available in most communities and the media.<br /><br />In my clinical experience, these factors will often promote needy, love-dazed courting co-parents to commit to the wrong people (mate, stepkids, and \\"other parent/s\\"), for the wrong reasons, at the wrong time.

I've lived in two stepfamilies, as a stepgran\dson, stepson, stepfather, and stepbrother.<br /><br />This classic book is commendable for (a) indicating the scope of issues with typical stepfamily clients, (b) focusing on the differences between intact biofamilies and typical stepfamilies, (c) hilighting common major therapeutic iswues and suggesting useful interventions, (d) being upbeat and realistic in tone, and (e) providing a usable index.<br /><br />I believe the Vishers omit several key issues: (1) the common stressor of co-parents being wounded from low-nurturance childhoods, and what to do about that; (2) the common stressors of values conflicts and (Karpmann) relationship triangles; (3) the concept of surface problems and underlying primary needs determining most behavior and surface \\"problems,\\" and (4) the importance of having co-parents and relatives accept their stepfamily identity, and what it *means;* (tho they do focus on helping co-parents change myths into realistic expectations).<br /><br />Overall, this is a fine book for students and experienced therapists who embrace the family systems paradigm.

John Gray has done a service to the public in raising their interest and awareness in effective communication and more satisfying relationships. However, he omits some essential points that greatly diminish the practical usefulness of this book:<br /><br />1) The profound influence of six psychological wounds on how we all think, feel, and communicate. Most people are unconsciously affected by two to six \\"false-self wounds\\" which will defeat the logic that Gray advocates, and often block the best efforts to follow his advice. The second-most pervasive of these wounds is excessive shame and guilt;<br /><br />2) This book doesn't explain process awareness, metatalk, empathic listening (thanks to Steven Covey), and \\"E(motion)-levels\\" which are essential for effective problem-solving;<br /><br />3) This book doesn't emphasize human primary needs, or learning to \\"dig-down\\" undeneath surface needs to idenify the primary needs. That dooms unaware readers to focus fruitlessly on surface needs;<br /><br />4) The author omits the reality of \\"R(espect)-messages\\" which inexorably shape the effectiveness of every non-verbal and verbal communiication sequence between any two people - partly because of false-self wounds;<br /><br />5) Gray doesn't describe how *inner* conflicts affect interpersonal conflicts, and what to do about that;<br /><br />There are other omissions, but these in particular prevent this book from being all that it could be.

I not recommend this book to any student, co-parent, or family professional seeking to learn the real stressors in stepfamilies and what to do about them.<br /><br />Structurally, this book is well organized, clear, has many illustrative quotes, is upbeat in tone, and very reader-friendly. However, the book omits explanation and illustration of five core hazards that typical stepfamilies face:<br /><br />1) co-parents' (unseen) psychological wounds from low-nurturance childhoods, and what they mean;<br /><br />2) blocked grief in adults and kids, what it means, and how to reduce it;<br /><br />3) co-parent unawareness of five key topics: (a) human personality formation and function, (b) high-nurturance families and relationships, (c) effective communication skills, (d) healthy 3-level grief, and (e) stepfamily realities and norms.<br /><br />4) needy, love-struck unaware partners choosing the wrong people to re/wed, for the wrong reasons, at the wrong time; and...<br /><br />5) little effective stepfamily help (courtship coaching, classes, informed counseling, co-parent support groups) available in most communities and the media (TV, books, radio, print publications, Web sites).<br /><br />In my experience, these five hazards combine to prevent typical stepfamily adults from following practical, heartfelt advice such as offered in this and similar books.<br /><br />For more perspective on this review, see: [...]	2004-07-18

I found myself flipping pages to get past inane, irrelevant dialog, and kept waiting for some suspense to appear. It never did, or I couldn't grasp it amidst the pages of socio-political philosophizings that Clancy had his young heroes and their mentors mouth. I kept thinking \\"young American men (that I know) don't talk like that,\\" as tepid dialogs over-punctuated by \\"roger that, bro\\" plodded on and on. I found it wearying, too, to wade through all the references to the main characters in Clancy's earlier works. They felt like curtains hung around a rectangle painted on the wall.<br />  The all-American heros and their handlers were never in any significant danger. The big terrorist attack was sobering in its realism, but was tidily cleaned up by our heros and staunch compatriots. Yawn. I literally did a double take on the last page, not ready to accept that the book just ended like a staircase going nowhere.<br />  This is the first time I have ever put my copy of a new book up for e-sale within minutes of closing the cover. I will never read this book again, unlike most titles by early-Clancy, Gresham, Sandford, Woods, Cook, Michener, Chrichton, Forsythe, Brown, et. al.<br />Take a vacation, Tom!	2003-08-26

I have read over 40 lay and clinical books on stepfamilies and stepparenting since 1979. \\"Bocoming a Stepfamily\\" is one of the two best ones I have read, on a complex and controversial subject. The other is Margaret Newman's \\"Stepfamily Realities.\\"<br />  A major plus for this book is the many stepfamily vignettes and quotes Papernow uses to illustrate her points. Another is her way of framing the developmental stages of four kinds of typical stepfamilies. A third plus is Papernow's insightful sketching of the respective viewpoints and needs of the biological parent and the stepparent in different phases of stepfamily development. A rare feature of her book vs. others in the genre is her acknowledging that many stepfamily co-parents (bioparents and stepparents) have significant psychological wounds from their childhood that impact their stepfamily relationships. Most stepfamily authors ignore this vital reality.<br />A last unique advantage to this book is Papernow's (accurate) description that stepparents (and their kids, if any) initially feel like \\"outsiders\\" in the new stepfamily system, and that a major task all members face is to acknowledge that, and work to balance the outsiders and insiders through expanding mutual empathy.<br />  A major drawback to this book is Papernow's decision to say little about ex mates. She implies that a nuclear stepfamily excludes or minimizes them (and any new mate and stepkids they have). The benefit of this is to keep her book conceptually simple. The great deficit is that it ignores a major source of re/marital and co-poarenting stress (or potential strength) for adults and kids alike. Unless a remarried bioparent is a widow/er, a nuclear stepfamily system *always* spans at least three co-parents and two or more co-parenting homes - even if a non-custodial bioparent is inactive.<br />  The only other major improvement I can see to this clear, well organized, reader-friendly overview book is to clarify Papernow's metaphoric concept of \\"stepfamily mapping.\\" She rightly says a common task for new stepfamily members is to \\"build a map\\" of each other's part of their new family. The metaphor seems vague and somewhat confusing. I believe what she means is \\"work to clarify each other's needs, new roles, and new stepfamily rules as you merge your biofamily cultures.\\"<br /><br />  I highly recommend this useful book to courting and remarried coparents, clergy, and other human-service professionals.<br /><br />For practical help on growing a high-nurturance stepfamily, see these free online articles [...]major improvement I can see to this clear, well organized, reader-friendly overview book is to clarify Papernow's metaphoric concept of \\"stepfamily mapping.\\" She rightly says a common task for new stepfamily members is to \\"build a map\\" of each other's part of their new family.

This collection of essays by professional researchers of &quot;the human condition&quot; affirms for me a profound truth about all of us, and  why we do what we do. These veteran authors' central theme is  &quot;multiplicity&quot; - the little-acknowledged universal fact that our  &quot;minds&quot; are naturally modular, routinely producing a range of  subselves or subpersonalities that we experience as one &quot;me&quot;. One  profound implication is that &quot;you and me&quot; are two physical people  - and also two *groups* of *selves* all interacting in complex ways,  simultaneously, in ways we're only vaguely conscious of.<br />  Author/editors John Rowan and Mick Cooper have done lay people and  professionals a great service by bringing together a group of articulate  experts who weave a convincing meta-story affirming our *multiplicity*  across theory, research, and practice. The implications of what they  collectively say are - in my biased opinion - world-view shifting. If most  people in our culture or world accepted that each of us is a *group* of  people, without being *crazy* in the least - I suspect our society would  shift dramatically, in many good ways.<br />  One of the many benefits of  this book is the buffet of different articulate concepts that are spread  before the reader. There is a unifying theme, but a rich diversity of  background, perspective, conceptions, terminology, and enterpretations that  empowers each reader to sample and construct our own belief about  &quot;multiplicity&quot; and it's personal and social meaning.<br />  The  content of this book, and the credibility of it's group of authors, has  shifted how I think about myself, you, and our fellow Beings - even after  62 years of observing and mulling. The implications of what these wise  people write are vast, and beyond summary here.<br />  I believe anyone -  not just clinicians - with genuine interest in personal growth, behavior,  and potential will significantly profit from reading this and related books  like &quot;Internal Family Systems Therapy&quot;, by Richard Schwartz.  Another interesting, useful book is &quot;Embracing Each Other&quot;, by  psychologists Hal and Sidra Stone.genuine interest in personal growth, behavior,  and potential will significantly profit from reading this and related books  like &quot;Internal Family Systems Therapy&quot;, by Richard Schwartz.

His book is sincere and interesting - and (in my opinion) misses the real answer to our \\"irrational\\" behaviors and how  to curb them.<br /><br />  The answer seems to lie in something recently called \\"Inner-family Systems Theory,\\" proposed by a variety of mental  health researchers pre-dating Carl Jung. Three readable books explain the answer to Weiner's quest:<br /><br />1) \\"Embracing Our  Selves,\\" by psychologists Hal Stone and Sidra Winkelman; (for lay  readers);<br /><br />2) \\"Internal Family Systems Therapy,\\" by psychologist  Dr. Richard Schwartz (Guilford, 1995; clinical - and very readable); and<br /><br />3) \\"The Plural Self,\\" (Sage, 1999) edited by John Rowan and Mick  Cooper. There are many similar titles by serious researchers.<br /><br />I believe in the ideas these authors propose, for I've seen them work with a range of my therapy clients over 14 years. From my research and professional practice of inner-family therapy, my own conclusions and recommendations are now available:<br /><br />4) \\"Who's *Really* Running Your Life? - free your Self from custody and guard your kids\\" (Xlibris.com, second ed.. 2002)<br /><br />  I agree with Weiner's ultimate conclusion that some form of \\"therapy\\" can often reduce our compulsions and obsessions  (including addictions). He unfortunately omits in his exhaustive summary of  therapies the one that really works directly to harmonize our \\"limbic  programs\\" (personality \\"subselves\\") under the innately wise leadership of our true Self.<br /><br />I applaud Weiner for raising the question, and refer you to the other books above for the *real* answer.	2000-01-10

He has done an enormous service for lay and clinical people interested in a core phenomenon that affects us all - personality splitting. His book is a  credible, well organized, well researched, relatively unbiased survey of  what a wide range of mental health researchers have written about splitting  in the last 150 years - including Freud, Jung, Fritz Perls, Virginia Satir,  and many others.  He concludes that - rather than having a single  monolithic personality, most (all ?) of us have many  \\"subpersonalities\\" that activate or slumber, depending on inner  and outer circumstances. This confirms my own clinical and personal  experience. The idea helps explain why we can \\"love\\"  someone\\" and \\"hate\\" them at the same time - and diet in the  morning, and binge in the evening.<br /><br />  The last chapter artfully weaves  ideas of several major researchers to postulate an idea of human  development that includes the path we each travel toward meaningful  spirituality and our \\"transpersonal,\\" or Higher Self. Rowan's  synthesis of earlier theories is the most lucid and credible I've read in  over 35 years' research.<br /><br />  Rowan is a well read social scientist,  psychologist, and an experienced therapist. Anyone seriously interested in  understanding theselves - and others - can profit by reading this  intriguing book. Another, probably easier to find, is \\"Internal Family  Systems Therapy,\\" by Dr. Richard Schwartz.<br /><br />Based on 19 years' experience, my own book on Rowan's subject focuses on a practical framework for \\"meeting\\" and harmonizing normal personality subselves under the expert guidance of the resident true Self:<br /><br />\\"Who's *Really* Running Your Life? - free your Self, and guard your kids\\" (xlibris.com, 2nd ed, 2002).<br /><br />To learn more about your subselves, see this free online course: [...]	1999-10-11
