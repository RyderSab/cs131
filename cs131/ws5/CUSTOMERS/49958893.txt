It shows that the love for the land, the love for  oneself is as important as anything else, but mostly more important than  the titles, visas, passports that keep putting obstacles in people's ways.  Having a life following the work on the fields is not only hard and  unrewarding, but if looked upon the way of a person in touch with  themselves it becomes more important than ownership of land, being born on  the right side of the line, or more important than all of it. Looking  forward to her next novel.	2000-08-09

Reveles tells some good  stories and I think they don't have to be super great to please the  critics,just warm enough to encourage a good look at out neighboors to the  South, who embrace life slightly differently in some ways, and yet just  like us in others.

Martinez shows us the conflicts of being poor, from a minority, and trying to grow up around circumstances that are difficult  at best. In the traditional sense, life has it own rules, but they often  clash with those rules imposed by its sorrounding community and we are all  enriched by learning of other's experiences.	2000-07-26

Very well told story, and quick to point out the immigrant experience in a  very realistic way. Having been writen in the early 90's, this novel is  along the first to freely speak of the new American experience as ethnic  literature. I recommend it.	1999-06-22

Santiago has the gift of telling her story in a very easy to understand fashion and her experience speaks for many of us who have come to the States at an  early age. It is a unique experience to be neither from back home or from  this newly adopted land, and Santiago addresses this issue quite well. I am  looking forward to her next book.	1999-04-05

It was funny and informative and it made one look at the issues that the meat industry has made us look at.

Later when I was on vacation I read it from cover to cover and I found it excellent as a resource guide for fun and tasteful food.  Also, my mother is quite a cook and has made some of the Chilean dishes  that Allende describes. I am glad Isabel took the time to write something  fun, I have enjoyed her other books and I recommend this one.	1999-04-01

I also lived  in Miami for many years and I knew quite a few people in exile. The satire  of this book really makes it a worthwhile read. Very good.	1999-04-01

In the book Manrique leads us through a tumultuos Spain visit, a journey back to Colombia and the adventures of  the main character. Manrique has a very good sense of humor and although he  shows how corruption and power have spoiled some of his characters, he  still brings out the warmth of the more real people that were a part of his  childhood, giving us a clear glimpse at a life in Colombia that will not  last forever. A very good book.	1999-04-01

Rios has a gift for interpreting what goes on in young boys minds,  and the stories themselves make for very good reading.	1999-03-31

There are several mentions of cultural  differences and inequalities which are central to the story of many  immigrants. A very enjoyable story.	1999-03-31

Culver's mother is a strong influence on the boy, but the real character he tries to emulate is his  uncle who is a real outdoor's man. I have enjoyed all of Lesley's books and  this one was also very good.	1999-03-31

The writing is good, the main character is very real, and overall  I enjoyed the book very much. It is not often that a person with a certain  mental inbalance can bounce back and live a so called normal life with her  family. I do recommend it.	1999-03-31

It is a painful realization, but as the changes that  are taking place involve more and more people around her, there is no way  she can remain ignorant of the corruption and political tirany. An  excellent book, with a very strong message valid for many nations as well  as Uruguay.	1999-03-30

It is tough, yet energetic enough to keep you interested and it is hard not to hear the clash of culture's  undercurrents. Very good book, very lively.	1999-03-28

The head of the family  is a typically wise older Mexican man that has tried hard to create his own  world where he can dictate how he wants his family to live. Yet, he senses  that there is only so much control you can exercise before you start  loosing those things that are precious to us. Very good and funny.	1999-03-25

In this book the art of cooking serves to demonstrate how we absorv our cultural heritage and proceed to  reproduce it at a later stage in our development. The protagonist is aware  of his own weaknesses but accepts them and lives out a life with many  interruptions, yet still he focuses on the essential truths that will make  his life work in the states or wherever he finds himself. I really enjoyed  it.	1999-03-25

The  novel is very intricate and yet simple in its ability to make us look  within ourselves for the strenght to endure life's hardships and to also  downplay the effect of other's criticisms of how we have chosen to live.	1999-03-24

Iliana has gone away to school only to feel responsible for the problem facing her family back home in New York. She quits school to go back to her family and she realizes that some of the problems can not be so easily  overcomed. Her father is one of the few male characters in the recent past  to be a strong family man and not the typically portrayed latin macho that  has no interest in their own family. It is a very fresh view at mental  illness, family togetherness, and the need to be your own person.	1999-03-09
