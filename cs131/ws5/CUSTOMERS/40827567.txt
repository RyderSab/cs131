I have dipped into it frequently and recommended it to many. And I have quoted it 8 times (few authors other than Thoreau were quoted more frequently) in my own recent book Deep Immersion: The Experience of Water (nominated for top environmental book of the year). Jerome's prose is wonderful and his stories engaging. He simply loves to get wet and would well understand Thoreau's maxim: \\"That part of you that is wettest is fullest of life\\" (quoted in Profitably Soaked: Thoreau's Engagement With Water, Green Frigate Books, 2003).	2004-09-04

Only Chris Duff's book comes close to matching it for creating lingering memories. Both works figure strongly in my book which reviews outdoor water recreation - Deep Immersion: The Experience of Water. Linnea writes with passion and enjoys getting wet and immersing herself in Lake Superior's coasts.

Indeed, I credit my own good fortune to have had that recent book of mine  nominated as top environmental book of the year, to the lessons in critrical thinking that I gleamed from a careful reading of Armbuster et al.'s book.
