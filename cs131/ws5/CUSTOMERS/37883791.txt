US	37883791	R366OBI52AZJP0	156931778X	419611869	Battle Royale	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Disturbing.	Telling the story of a bunch of junior high students sent to an island to slaughter each other... one begins to realize why the film version of the story was banned from sales and release in the United States. I'm surprised that the book wasn't as well. It's much more graphic and psychological than the film.<br />That, though, is the book's strong point. For a translation from an Asian language, this book is surprisingly well-written. The narrative is strong and precise, and although the dialogue isn't that great, the blunt vocabulary create for a terrifying read. The book also delves into the psychological aspects of the story--how it affects the characters' behavior and mindset as the game begins to quicken and become more competitive. <br />It's a strong, solid, and terrifying book. It's great, if you have the stomach to read it.	2004-01-02

This book is certainly imforative on the &quot;history of philsophy&quot;. I learned a lot about philosophy and European history from reading this weird novel. I have to admit, because of the translation some of the philosphy is really complicated and hard to understand until you've read the paragraph or two a few times over. <br />The story is also so far-fetched that once it developed, I was simply befuddled. I asked myself things such as &quot;where the heck did that come from?&quot;, among other things. The premise is creative once you discover it, but the last 100 pages or so are very... arbitrary and far-fetched. <br />Once the philsophy hits dialogue form instead of letter form (you'll understand it when you read the book), it becomes harder to follow, but it's still interesting all the same.<br />Recommended for sure.	2004-01-02

Being a sophomore in high school, it made me take a look at things and I realized how accurate the book is. People say high school is all about cliques, sex, drugs, rocknroll, and academics.<br />This book made me realize how much more there is to high school than that. It's the effects of these things that make the book so much deeper than the others in its specific drama. I've never looked at people in my school the same way again. And that's a good thing.	2004-01-02

Each vignette is a piece of artwork in its own right, but I felt as if there should've been more vignettes to tie together the story.<br />While there was a sense of closure, the end came far too quickly. A beautiful, quick read. I just wish there was more to it.	2004-01-02

It was definitely interesting, but I found it hard to relate to on some levels because it is for such a female-oriented audience, and I wasn't able to identify with the foreign alienation that comes with being a Chinese immigrant.<br />The story is brisk at some times, yet scathingly slow in a couple parts. Nevertheless, the characters are all interesting and provide something different for every reader, and for every time you read it.	2004-01-02

They never cease to bore me to tears.<br />This book's twist makes it one of the most interesting reads I've had in a long time. And mind you, this is a romance story.<br />The idea of chronoloical displacement disorder is very original, and makes for a complex plot with many ins, outs, twists, turns, and dips. The book may start off as confusing, but I got the hang of the chronological orders within a couple chapters.<br />I seriously recommend this book for all mystery, drama, and romance buffs. A great read.	2004-01-02

It blew me away.<br />This is a genuine fairy tale. I haven't read a fairy tale in ages, and this one ranks as one of the best I've ever come across. The characters are hella hilarious, romantic, and all are either hateable or loveable. I highly recommend this to all readers, and hope you guys read it over again as much as I did.	2004-01-02

Not your typical fantasy, but not your typical horror novel either. It's both, and has a Western flavor to it. <br />It's hard to describe, other than saying the story is intriguing. Why is he reaching the Dark Tower? Who is the man in black? What are these prophecies? Where do they come from? What is the gunslinger's purpose?<br />Is this one giant allegory?<br />These are just a few of the many answered questions that this series provides. A thrilling read.	2004-01-02

The character interaction is everything from disturbing to absolutely hilarious. I read this book in one evening, and I couldn't help but feel like I was a changed man.<br />Being an alcoholic myself, it was easier for me to relate to Augusten. It makes me glad, though, that people can understand the struggles of being gay and an alcoholic, and why things happen the way they do in this harsh world. I hope this book helps relieve judgement, even if it's just a little bit.	2004-01-02

I finished this book in less than 3 days, even though it was 900 pages or so. I simply could not put it down at all. <br />My family has a history of mental illnesses, and this book is very accurate in depicting their developments and their effects on the ill person and the peers around him. It's simply an incredibly written book. Without a doubt, one of the most incredible achievements in literary history.	2004-01-02

To say the least, it is one of the most horrifyingly objective and meaningful books ever written. I read it in a single evening, unable to put it down. It was like a car wreck-It was terrible, but I had to finish it. I couldn't stand not reading it.<br />The spiritual, emotional, and physical changes that Elie goes through serve as a frightening allegory to the condition of the human race, as well as teaching a lesson about the tides of war. Simply perfect.	2004-01-02

Though it is told from the perspective of a German soldier in the World War, he goes through the same exact things that every other soldier on the planet goes through in times of war.<br />The prose is chillingly objective. It's interesting how the men become animals in times of battle, but cease to lack a single emotion once they have left the battlefield. It makes one thing of the lost youth that every generation has, had, and will have in the times yet to come.<br />When the story reaches its inevitable end, the reader is shocked with the power of Remarque's message. One could not have written it better.	2004-01-02

Being a big fan of mythology of all sorts, this book truly took to me quite well. The main character is somewhat dry, but I think that complements the rest of the colorful characters very nicely.<br />The dialogue is amusing, the story is fantastic in every sense of the word, and it is quite thrilling. I couldn't stop reading it. It helps to know a bit of Norse Mythology when going into the book, because you can see the mythos paralells ahead of time. Before reading the book, you should at least familiarize yourself with some of the names and roles of some of the Norse gods so you aren't lost in the last 100 or so pages.<br />A great read. Highly recommended.	2003-05-27

The first thing that blew me away about the book is the language used in the narration -- the metaphors and similes are simple, but completely fluent and totally appropriate and beautiful. The tranquility of a Japanese garden was conveyed perfectly throughout the entire novel. <BR>The next thing that took my breath away was the complexities that intertwined the histories of the characters. Each character's history somehow affected another's, and in turn affected anothers in the present. It was like seeing layers upon layers go upon a canvas to create an amazing painting.<BR>The subplots involving Stephen's romance and the leprosy town fit perfectly. I would change absolutely nothing about this book.<BR>I have to say that this is the best Core Literature Novel I've ever read for school, even surpassing To Kill A Mockingbird.<BR>There better be a movie made from this.	2003-05-27

The complexities of Jack and his son are so intertwined and far out there that I read the book twice to absorb it all. The writing is chilling, and the grotesque horror sequences kept me up late into the night.<BR>One of the few books that scared me, and that is truly saying something. Though the movie is great, I find that the book is certainly better. Don't you even dare watching the mini-series, because it is horrible (even though it's somewhat faithful to the book). <BR>A complex and scary read.	2003-05-27

The facts and the details, the hardships that the six main characters go through make you question President Truman's morals and true consideration in his execution of the operation that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.<br />The novel loses some steam in the last twenty pages or so, but I still highly recommend it if you don't have to read it for school.	2003-05-27

But once it does, then the real meat of the story begins. Pi's spiritually and physically adverse journey made my jaw drop in awe and wonder, quite literally at points.<BR>Towards the end, you are left wondering whether it was a dream, hallucination, reality, or a truly spiritual encounter/experience (those who have finished the book will know what I'm talking about).<br />Granted, the book is slow and took me some time to get through, but I highly recommend it.	2003-05-27

The imagination of the child in this book, his experiences, his friends, the long summers, the memoir-like writing of the novel... it just feels like an amazing journey into the era of the 50s, a time in which I never lived.<BR>The main character's imagination and creativity, along with the amazingly intricate plot with complex characters makes for a slow, yet absolutely compelling read.	2003-05-27

The reason that I give it a higher rating than 2 or so stars is the dog. He's just pretty cool. A dog that can communicate via scrabble pieces is pretty original and comes up with some cool plot devices. Theres actually a few good moments of suspense, as well.<BR>It just feels so B-Movie like to me.	2003-05-27

It's got disturbing subject matter that cross the subjects of pedophilia, rape, psychological malpractice, family dysfunction/abuse, homosexuality, drug use, etc. Somehow, though, it comes together as one of the most hilarious books I think I've ever read.	2003-05-27

The completely objective point of view helps make it more powerful as the reader jumps from troop to troop, keeping track of the different blockades and events that affect each and every single person in the operation. <br />People argue that it's too hard to keep track of all the characters, but I say that could be one of the points the author is trying to make, or it could be a point that is unintentionally made. Nevertheless, a great book.	2003-05-27

There are actually few paralells in the two stories, and this one doesn't exactly have the happiest of endings. <BR>Yeah, so anyway, Memoirs is written with an amazingly colorful language-the descriptions are absolutely mouth-watering. The characters are very distinct and real; they make you feel like you're living in the book. The book almost reads like a fantasy novel because the culture is so vibrant, so different.<br />Personally, I was hooked from the beginning. But I have heard from others that the book takes a bit to get going. Mind that the book is pretty long, but it is quite worth it.	2003-05-27

Beneath the candy-coated exterior lies a truly horrific story of a boy trapped in a world where there is no escape, where children are taken and used for food and torture, where the value of life is &quot;less than a penny&quot;. <br />Filled with completely memorable and imaginative sequences, this novella (it takes no longer than 90 minutes to read) can be argued to surpass Clive Barker's other masterpiece, Weaveworld.	2003-05-27

The surreal storyline and characters drive the quick read forth to make it exponentially more powerful, leading to an amazing climax.<BR>The book is certainly better than the movie, and in the case of this film, that is saying a lot. <BR>If you're looking for something to read on a plane or in an afternoon or something, pick this up.	2003-05-27

It is a clever book about the wicked witch of the West, how she grew up, her boyfriend(s), her school, and how she came to hate the brat named Dorothy. It's her true story.<BR>Maguire has the uncanny ability to convey transformation of character. You witness her grow from a young girl to a naive young teen, to a heartless teenager to a somewhat passionate and more sensitive young adult, to an ultimately cruel and overpassionate woman that meets her inevitable doom. The book is genius, and no knowledge of Wizard of Oz is required to enjoy the book to the fullest! Highly recommended.	2003-05-27

The Sword of Shannara was such an amazing book that I thought no sequel could meet my expectations of a sequel, that the sequel would be beyond all words plain [bad]compared to the original. Boy, was I wrong.<BR>What sets this apart from the Sword of Shannara is the pacing. The story moves much quicker in this book (thus being about 140 pages shorter or so, I forget). The characters are younger, so their actions are much more appealing to the reader. The dialogue has its share of humor and emotion, and the settings are told with an unsurpassed brilliance. Simply the best in the Shannara series.	2002-07-21

The story pacing is a little slower in this next episode of the famous Shannara series. The reason this is bad is the fact that the story isn't on as epic a scope as the books before it. This doesn't totally ruin the book, but loses character and history development that the other books are known for.<BR>It's quite a good fantasy book, but I wouldn't be as dissapointed if it didn't have the Shannara label.
