Can it be worthwhile to buy a book that long?  Should anyone really read the whole thing?<br /><br />Yes, yes, and no.  I strongly recommend this book, because it literally contains revolutionary new information about the development of the English language, and about perhaps the greatest period of literary creativity in the history of English--roughly 1550 to 1650.  David Daniell, a Shakespeare scholar by training, persuasively demonstrates how William Tyndale's translation of the New Testament from the original Greek into brilliantly vivid English, and half the Old Testament from Hebrew (all he could complete before he was strangled and burned at the stake), triggered a great burst of literary creativity (and political revolution) in England.  Note that Tyndale was killed in 1536, a generation before Shakespeare's birth in 1564.  During that period, Tyndale's translation was smuggled into England and provided the language, images and ideas for the brilliant generation of literary geniuses in the latter sixteenth century.  In short, modern English was invented by the two Williams, Shakespeare and Tyndale.  99.9% of all educated people only understand the importance of Shakespeare--and he was actually the second William.<br /><br />I've read Christopher de Hamel's \\"The Book: A History of the Bible\\", Benson Bobrick's \\"Wide as the Waters\\", and Alister McGrath's \\"In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Version\\".  None of these books tell so clearly the story that Daniell has to tell.  Daniell solves the old mystery of how a committee could produce such an excellent result as the KJV:  by  essentially plagiarising Tyndale.  90% of the KJV is taken from Tyndale's translations of the same passages.  Daniell is a gifted reader of English prose and poetry, and he vividly evokes the importance of the many inter-relationships between Tyndale and the other translators of the Bible into English.  Daniell has a fine ear and is a graceful and vivid writer about language's meanings and beauties.<br /><br />The bottom line is that we should all get the 1599 Geneva Bible available in a reprint version.  I've always known that the 1611 KJV couldn't have influenced Shakespeare, but after reading \\"The Bible in English\\", I became convinced that in order to understand my favourite 16th and 17th century writers, I have to get the Geneva Bible (essentially the Tyndale translation, with notes, upgraded with the best Greek and Hebrew scholarship available in the generation after Tyndale's execution).  This is the book that is the hidden root of the best literature in English.<br /><br />Of course, like all revolutions, this book is unfair to its enemies.  The Catholic position is repeatedly parodied by Daniell.  This discussion of key figures like Reginald Pole and Stephen Gardiner is two-dimensional, and ignores the powerful impact on the Catholic Church of the scriptures (exemplified in figures like Pole, a convinced Catholic who was immersed in the Bible).  Peter Donaldson's book \\"Machiavelli and the Mystery of State\\" is a required antidote to Daniell's distortions about Tudor Catholics.<br /><br />And it seems clear that Daniell has no really interest in events outside the period that clearly fascinates him, from the birth of Tyndale in approx. 1494 to 1611, when the KJV was published, which Daniell convincingly demonstrates was a victory of the good over the best.  This is the superb heart of the book, extending from the forward to page 460.<br /><br />After this period, there are some interesting passages in the book, which emerge startling out of the stereotypes and shallow scholarship, such as his discussion of Bunyan, and his funny little thesis about the relationship between the composer Handel and Alexander Pope.  There is a bizarre, long section about Blake which has no place in this book.  And the chapters on America are worthless.  Daniell seems to get his understanding ofcontemporary America from TV, and historically his discussions of Jonathan Edwards, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and their times are innocent of any knowledge of the relevant scholarship.  Daniell's views on America and Americans are literally not worth reading.<br /><br />But in the context of his great theme, I consider these flaws minor, even if they repeatedly mar the last 1/3 of the book.  The first 460 pages of this book are magnificent and wonderful.  I'd pay ten times the price of this book to learn what is in the first half of the book, and I'm grateful to David Daniell for teaching me what he knows about Tyndale and the Geneva Bible.

I strongly recommend it for readers who have already read Peter Brown's incomparable biography of Augustine, and perhaps also a book on Manicheism--my personal favourite remains the great study by Hans Jonas, although since Nag Hammadi there have been many more recent books based upon the Gnostic texts discovered at Nag Hammadi.  For readers who are  already familiar with Brown's biography, this is a splendid updating of the facts about Augustine's life.  But I would not recommend it for readers just learning about Augustine, for example somebody who has just read THE CONFESSIONS and now wants to learn more about Augustine himself.  The best biography (as O'Donnell himself generously acknowledges in a footnote of this book) remains the Peter Brown biography.<br /><br />One of the key features of this book is the availability of new research, and new material, not available to Peter Brown when he wrote his great book(s) on Augustine and late antiquity.  O'Donnell is immersed in seemingly all the scholarship on Augustine and on subjects related to Augustine, and O'Donnell brings a mature and considered judgment to his consideration of Augustine's life and work.<br /><br />Having said that, I do have the following caveat, which is why I recommend O'Donnell's book as a supplement, but not a substitute, for the Brown biography:  O'Donnell's tone veers from learned and ironic and amused to being slightly sardonic, even cynical about Augustine.<br /><br />I remember reading A.N. Wilson's biographies of Tolstoy and C.S. Lewis and feeling very satisfied when I had finished; over time, however, I realised that Wilson had subtlely diminished his subjects and that I had lost much of my esteem for Tolstoy and Lewis as a result of having read Wilson's biographies of them.  There is an underlying tone in this book which is similar to Wilson's tone, although O' Donnell is not as corrosive.  Perhaps a better match to O'Donnell's tone is the biography PAUL: A CRITICAL LIFE by Jerome Murphy-O'Connor.  Like Murphy-O'Connor, O'Donnell is a real authority on his subject, with a career's worth of reflection to add to his real expertise in the primary and secondary sources--he has read and thought about the gamut of facts and interpretations offered on his subject.  But Murphy-O'Connor doesn't share Paul's religious faith--his Christianity is much more attenuated than was that of Paul, and that seems to be the case as well with O'Donnell and Augustine. (A few years after his biography of C.S. Lewis, Wilson publicly declared himself to be an atheist).  So be prepared for a certain distance, a certain scepticism and even cynicism in this book.<br /><br />Having said all that, I really admired O'Donnell's magisterial grasp of his material and his profound, considered take on Augustine, his work, and his world.  What I considered the flaws in the tone spring from an interpretation which, while it may not be shared by all readers (I certainly don't share it),  will not obscure the many wondrous insights that O'Donnell offers, insights which leave me admiring Augustine all the more.ch to O'Donnell's tone is the biography PAUL: A CRITICAL LIFE by Jerome Murphy-O'Connor.

US	53090123	R2EJPCDC2JQVJA	1893554961	196878441	Red Star Over Hollywood: The Film Colonys Long Romance with the Left	Books	3	36	62	N	N	Five star title - dull book	Movie stars and secret Communists-what could be a more exciting combination, right?  Alas, what little political romance exists in this book is mostly in the subtitle:  \\"The Film Colony's Long Romance with the Left\\".<br /><br />The irony about this book is that one finds in its pages virtually none of the controversy one might expect, in the current charged political atmosphere, from a book on the subject of Hollywood and Communism.  The Radoshes have been so scrupulous about sticking to documented (and generally reasonably well-known) facts that they have converted an exciting subject into a dull book.  What we get is a worthy sociological treatise, based on secondary research, that documents what fair-minded people have known all along--ie the fact that the Communist Party did succeed with infiltrating the movie business in the 1930s and 1940s.<br /><br />The problem with this book is that the real issues of the Left in Hollywood are best treated by a psychological, not a sociological, study.  How can we understand Left-wing political commitments that began, in the context of the great Depression and before Stalin's Purge Trials and the collectivization of the peasants, by working to change real injustice-racial prejudice, poverty, and various miscarriages of the criminal justice system-and ended in some cases by supporting a monstrous Soviet tyranny?  This is a very complex set of circumstances and the Radoshes dutifully recount the relevant facts without providing much insight into the motives of the Hollywood figures they describe.<br /><br />RED STAR perfunctorily recounts the very different experiences of key individuals like Budd Schulberg, Ring Lardner, Jr., Howard Koch, Albert Maltz, Elia Kazan and John Howard Lawson, without making conceptual distinctions between honourable but misguided people and cynical, traitorous conspirators.  They are essentially all tarred with the brush of being Communists or \\"fellow travelers\\", which, while strictly true, provides no real ethical or psychological insight into why they did what they did.  The paradoxical result of this approach is that good people look worse than they really were, and the few really evil people look better than they deserve.<br /><br />In any case, the real importance of the Hollywood Communists, as the Radoshes briefly acknowledge at the beginning and at the end of RED STAR, was that their lives supplied a myth which sanctified the truly dangerous, destructive and anti-American Hollywood Leftism of the 1970s onward.<br /><br />Perhaps the Radoshes tried so hard to be neutral (they are associates of David Horowitz, founder of the Center for Popular Culture, and therefore easy targets of abuse from the Left) that they've tied not one, but both hands behind their backs--although  the section on Dalton Trumbo, towards the end of the book, is a fascinating discussion of the tortured psychological terrain traversed by Hollywood's Communists.  Not surprisingly, this is also the section of the book most thoroughly attributable to extensive primary, archival research by the Radoshes.  The Trumbo section is excellent, and perhaps the Radoshes were unable to find the same quality of information to support their discussions of other Hollywood Communists.<br /><br />Although the Radoshes prove the the inner world of a Communist can be compelling presented in their section on Trumbo, in the possible absence of the necessary archival data, perhaps the most direct access to the strange psychological world of Hollywood Communism remains, paradoxically, the fictional world. Readers should consider seeking out Paula Fox's novel THE WESTERN COAST, with its description of life among mid-level Hollywood Communists in the 30s and 40s, and Bulgakov's masterful novel THE MASTER AND MARGARITA, with its  description of what life was like for artists and writers under Stalin (something Hollywood Communists knew about but tried to ignore).  To understand the profound personal agoniesunderlying the events described by the Radoshes, David Horowitz's memoir RADICAL SON is excellent on issues like free speech, truth and deception, the entanglement of political and personal loyalties, and the distortion of well-intentioned social and political commitments in the service of violence and repression.  For a compelling account of the cultural havoc wreaked by Hollywood's Left as it reached the apex of its power in the 60s and 70s-generating truly sinister figures like Bert Schneider-readers should consult Peter Biskind's EASY RIDERS, RAGING BULLS.<br /><br />About the only surprising aspect of RED STAR is the degree to which Ronald Reagan consistently played a moderate and reasonable role in the HUAC investigations of the 40s and 50s.  Reagan courageously stood up to both Communist conspirators and to Government investigators and frightened Hollywood producers who busy infringing Constitutional rights of free speech.<br /><br />Unfortunately, most of the rest of the book has the feel of a long, thorough, and honest beating administered to a dead horse.  There may be news to Susan Sarandon and Barbra Streisand in here, but they are unlikely to read the book.  RED STAR is at best a start, and will hopefully open the subject to other authors who will come closer to realizing its fascinating and politically significant potential.s, David Horowitz's memoir RADICAL SON is excellent on issues like free speech, truth and deception, the entanglement of political and personal loyalties, and the distortion of well-intentioned social and political commitments in the service of violence and repression.

The two cases are linked by more than Hitler's infamous remark just before launching Operation Barbarossa \\"Who now speaks of the annihilation of the Armenians?\\"  The Turkish genocide of the Armenians was also perpetuated by the leadership of a modernizing State, in the context of war, using its organizational and administrative resources to their fullest capacities in an attempt to murder as many members of an entire people as possible.  For some reason, it does not sit well with many Holocaust scholars to refer to the tragic pioneering suffering of the Armenians at the hands of the Turks and their allies as genocide, but that was what it was.  Mann acknowledges the similarities between the Armenian and Jewish experiences in this book, although he does not demonstrate particular insight into the events that produced the Armenian genocide.  Nevertheless, in the prevailing climate of intellectual opinion, which forbids scholarly reference to the mass murders of the Armenians as a genocide, Mann's book constitutes a long step in the right direction.<br /><br />Mann's two main theses are (1) that ethnic cleansing and genocide are, as his title indicates, \\"the dark side of democracy\\", and (2) that genocide and ethnic cleansing often develop their full-blown features as a series of immediate \\"solutions\\" to perceived obstacles or frustrations, they are not meticulously planned in advance with their ultimate goal clearly in view.<br /><br />Despite the scholarly introductory chapter with its elaborate chart depicting Mann's theses (down to parts 4a, 4b, 5, etc.), Mann utterly fails to demonstrate the validity of his first thesis.  On the face of it, the fact that his two principle examples, the Armenian and Jewish genocides, were perpetrated by Turks and Germans acting in the context of authoritarian dictatorships makes his case difficult to prove.  While there is something in the idea that democracy can be confused with ethnicity, Mann can only show that this factor is at best a contributing one.  Readers looking for a jaundiced view of the cruelty of which democracies are capable should read Jacob Burckhardt's THE GREEKS AND GREEK CIVILISATION; this book is the English translation of university lectures that poisoned at least two generations of Germans against the idea of liberal democracy, with catastrophic consequences.  The German experience shows just how dangerous Mann's project really is.  To say that ethnic cleansing is the \\"dark side\\" of democracy is a powerful indictment of democracy, and, given that he doesn't prove his thesis, Mann appears to have brought the charge recklessly.  Hopefully, his book will have little of the influence on English-speaking readers that Burckhardt's did on German-speaking readers.<br /><br />Mann does succeed in demonstrating his second main thesis which, if widely accepted, provides a framework in which policy tools can begin to be developed to try and prevent future genocides.  Of course, the classic statement of this thesis was Arno Mayer's WHY DID THE HEAVENS NOT DARKEN?  This great book was heavily criticized by some Holocaust scholars who thought that they saw an exculpatory element in Mayer's assertion that the killing of 6 million Jews was not planned by the Nazis from the very beginning.  As a matter of fact, both Mayer and Mann show amply that the \\"contingent\\" and evolving nature of most genocide is as evil and cruel a human activity as it is possible to imagine.  There is no point scanning the horizon for a government busy creating a fully articulated vision of extermination, because that's not how genocide develops.  And for pointing to that truth, this book, for all its flaws, is worth a read by those seeking to understand this grim subject.itarian dictatorships makes his case difficult to prove.

Firstly, I recommend that anyone interested in the religious implications of evolution consider buying THE GOD OF EVOLUTION, not because it provides definitive answers (although Edwards seems to think he does), but because it's a pioneering attempt to address the religious implications of evolution.<br /><br />Darwinists won't care at all about this book; it was written for Christians seeking some understanding about evolution beyond the often infantile abuse heaped upon it by the Dawkinses of the world.<br /><br />There are plenty of books that already address the religious implications of evolution, of course, beginning with THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES.  But despite Darwin's clever and disingenuous comments in that book that he didn't see how a belief in natural selection conflicted in any way with traditional religious belief, Darwin had already lost his religious faith before he published ORIGIN, and he and the thinkers most closely associated with Darwinism (Huxley, Haeckel, Spencer, etc. etc.) were aggressive anti-Christians.  This anti-religious, and specifically anti-Christian, tradition among Darwinists continues to this day with Dawkins, the late Gould, Dennett, Ruse, et. al.<br /><br />So Edwards is taking on a big task in attempting to reconcile Darwinian evolution (the beginnings of life ex nihilo and natural selection as the principal operating cause of all biological complexity and diversity) with traditional Christianity.  It seems clear that Edwards is a believing Christian, so this book is a sincere attempt to achieve this reconciliation.<br /><br />The question to ask, really, is whether Edwards understands Darwinism better than the Darwinists.  They all think that natural selection is a cruel mechanism that unleashes massacre and starvation on the vast majority of living beings but is for the greater good of the biosphere as a whole.  The fact that Darwinists are almost exclusively atheists speaks to their view of the kind of God implied by Darwinism.  Edwards thinks that Darwinism is consistent with a loving God.  Yes, Edwards knows that there is some regretable pain associated with natural selection, but in one of his most superficial sections he tries to make light of all the suffering that the Darwinists, by and large, have the intellectual honesty (perhaps because they secretly relish it) to acknowledge.<br /><br />Interestingly, Edwards is so committed to strong-form Darwinism that, while he mentions, he does not emphasise the much more ambiguous perspective of physics and cosmology, which seems to suggest some sort of eerie design in the universe, with all its precise constants and finely tuned balances of power, without any of which life could never have evolved.  Edwards doesn't need this evidence because he is quite happy to accept Darwin's vision of a cruel, apparently purposeless world.  Edwards sees his contribution to theology as his novel proposals to show how the Darwinian vision is perfectly consistent with a loving God who can be worshipped by Christians.<br /><br />Does Edwards succeed?  Not in the view of this reader.  He advances some interesting ideas, esp. early in the book, with his reflections on the relational nature of God.  But his understanding of evolution is shallow and enthusiastic.  In fact, some of his proposals are inadvertently dangerous, as a more clever thinker than Edwards could easily turn them around and use them against Christianity.  But Edwards (along with John Haught), is trying to get the ball rolling . . . that is, he is trying to get theologians and religious thinkers to engage seriously with Darwinism, and that is a necessary task.<br /><br />Readers intrigued by the attempt, however, should also consider reading Simon Conway Morris's book LIFE'S SOLUTION, with its broader view of evolution, in order to first get some of the scientific facts.to their view of the kind of God implied by Darwinism.

But we can all have a meaningful personal encounter with this great man and servant of God:  his biographer George Weigel delivered himself of the opinion some time ago that John Paul II's greatest legacy may be writings.  Weigel had in mind, I believe, John Paul II's outstanding book THE THEOLOGY OF THE BODY, but it is true of his last book MEMORY AND IDENTITY, as well.<br /><br />John Paul was not just a man of action and a great leader--although he was one of the greatest in those respects--but a profound thinker.  I am extremely tempted to set out the thesis of MEMORY AND IDENTITY in this review, but the book is only 190 pages, and I have no right to further condense the very brief, and profound, last work of this great man.<br /><br />I will only say that he begins the work by dealing directly with the problem of good and evil--and as always with this Pope, he does so from a fresh and optimistic perspective which is grounded in deep learning and reflection.  It is only in Chapter 23, interestingly a chapter that addresses issues relating to modern Europe, that he reveals the meaning of the title MEMORY AND IDENTITY and shows its profound significance.<br /><br />One last comment:  the book is presented in the form of a conversation, and it is easy to read.  But don't be misled into thinking that MEMORY AND IDENTITY is a superficial interview.  Every sentence is lapidary, almost scriptural in the density with which meaning has been packed into the words.  Yes, the book is easy to read and will benefit anybody who does so, but it also will stand up to very careful and close reading.  To take only one example, the very brief discussion on pages 169 - 170 in Chapter 24, \\"The Maternal Memory of the Church\\", while adequate in itself, refers back to the incredibly rich and profound discussion in his 606 page book THE THEOLOGY OF THE BODY.  Readers can glean what is easily available on the surface, or can go back for the riches that shine through in layer after layer of this book.f the Church\\", while adequate in itself, refers back to the incredibly rich and profound discussion in his 606 page book THE THEOLOGY OF THE BODY.

This is a book for readers who have an open mind about evolution and are willing to consider the possibility that evolution is not necessarily identical with Darwin's Malthusian vision of starvation and massacre.<br /><br />So, if you are a Darwinist seeking to have your beliefs merely confirmed again, don't buy this book; you'll get much more satisfaction out of the latest book by Dawkins or Ruse.  LIFE'S SOLUTION will only make you uneasy, even indignant (the anger, even outrage, provoked by Conway Morris's refusal to pander to Darwinist theology is reflected in many of the reader reviews on Amazon.com).<br /><br />On the other hand, readers who have noticed the high percentage of rhetoric, sophism and special pleading in the books of Dawkins, Dennett and Ruse, and the low percentage of objectively presented biology in their books, should take a look at LIFE'S SOLUTION.  Readers looking for a book that addresses, not whimsical and distorted examples, but the actual science that applies to biological evolution, will find Conway Morris's book packed with fascinating ideas.<br /><br />LIFE'S SOLUTION is, in effect, an application of the widest science, including physics, to the debate about Darwinism versus design. I don't know if physicists are more or less religious than the general population, but at least physicists are aware of how uncannily orderly the universe is, however they believe it came about.  Evolutionary biologists who insist a priori on the lack of meaning in their lives have somehow hijacked the debate and fit the science of biology onto the Procrustean bed of their pseudo-theology.<br /><br />Conway Morris proceeds through most of the book by discussing the  actual science that is relevant to evolution, including the nature of our galaxy, our solar system, planet earth and its moon, molecular biology, genetics, and various morphological issues.  He might have been forgiven by the ultra-Darwinists for these chapters despite his decision to forgo interpolating his scientific explanations with frequent assertions that no matter how wonderous all this may be, it's of course totally meaningless and purposeless.<br /><br />He might have avoided a good deal of trouble for himself had he not included Chapter 11 \\"Towards a Theology of Evolution?\\".  In this chapter, he basically calls Darwin and Darwin's supporters on the fact that, whatever they may pretend, they are constantly making theological and metaphysical claims.  With section headings such as \\"Darwin's Priesthood\\", \\"Heresy!

Books	1	22	69	N	N	Ruse is a lightweight	I'd like to know what's going on at Harvard University Press . . . have they launched a series of high school texts without telling anyone? A friend of mine suggested that we read this book and I was shocked by how mediocre it is.<br /><br />Readers who are seeking a clear, documented and science-focused discussion of the debate about Darwinism versus design should order Simon Conway Morris' LIFE'S SOLUTION (published by Cambridge University Press, incidently).  His notion of convergence is basically a proxy for the design argument without the metaphysical baggage.  I don't know if physicists are more or less religious than the general population, but at least physicists are aware of how uncannily orderly the universe is, however they believe it came about.  Conway Morris brings this pespective to biology, which has been hi-jacked long since by the anti-teleologist gang of Darwinian popularizers. Ruse is one of them, albeit in sheep's clothing.<br /><br />The first two pages of Ruse's Introduction were so simple-minded and patronizing that I almost couldn't bear to read them, but I struggled on and was rewarded by an ascent to mediocrity in the rest of the Introduction.  The crucial flaw in Ruse's book is that it is basically a history of philosophy and religion, and Ruse is apparently incapable of getting any of his material straight.<br /><br />You may question how a nice man like Ruse succeeded in annoying me to this degree, but my concerns are more serious than the level at which Ruse has pitched his rhetoric: he doesn't understand his subject. For a guy to address the rational, fact-based vs. speculative/faith (or irrational) way of looking at the universe without once mentioning Spinoza is to commit malpractice: \\"Deus sive Natura\\" (\\"God, that is, nature\\" meaning that God is not distinguishable from nature) is the most devastating blow ever struck to the religious conception that observable design in nature is an implicit proof for the existence of a creator.  And looking at the list of books he has either written or edited, Ruse has established a niche for himself as an expert on design and theology as it relates to evolution!  A wondeful example of the power of the evolutionary strategy of mimicry . . . !<br /><br />When Ruse does discuss the science, he repeatedly delivers himself of his real position by hiding behind that intellectual fraud and bully Dawkins. For example, Ruse's comment \\"The only possible response to Dawkins, is that, Darwin or not, you feel compelled to accept that our understanding of nature, of living things, is changed and illuminated and made complete by your acceptance of the existence and creative power and sustaining nature of God\\" (page 331) is pathetic blather-and both condescending and presumptuous since he is putting words in the mouth of his hypothetical religious person. However, the passage confirms what is evident throughout DARWIN AND DESIGN--that Ruse merely plays \\"good cop\\" to Dawkins' and Dennett's \\"bad cop\\"-while sharing with Dawkins an agenda of extreme intolerance to religious claims for the existence of any form of value or meaning. Pages 331 - 333 are unpersuasive to a degree that is simply embarrassing, and pages 334 - 336 sink to a level of bathos and obsequiousness that it is a rare experience to behold.<br /><br />But back to Ruse . . . the last chapter, Chapter 15 \\"Turning Back the Clock\\" is the most interesting in the book, but it demonstrates that Ruse brought a knife to an intellectual gunfight. Ruse had already confirmed this for me-at the absolute latest-on page 208 when he writes, \\"The fairest conclusion, therefore, is that, with respect to the question of progress, people are very much divided.\\" How can the author of a book called Darwin and Design: Does Evolution have a Purpose? avoid taking a position on the question of progress?<br /><br />To return to the opening sections of Darwin and Design, Ruse's pastiche of Leo Strauss's distinction between Athens and Jerusalem (beginning page 11) bleaches out most of the content that made Strauss's essay famous . . . and that is being as kind to Ruse as possible. In his version, when he turns from Athens to Jerusalem, he ignores Judaism with the breezy comment \\"As we leave Athens for Jerusalem, we must move the clock forward, past the birth of Jesus and into the Christian era\\" (Page 19)! This is astounding, given that (a) Jerusalem had ceased to exist, having been sacked and razed by the army of Titus, in the era to which Ruse is referring-which vitiates the original logic of the Athens:Jerusalem metaphor, and (b) it ignores the fact that Judaism is the inalienable root of Christianity, and most relevant Christian ideas associated with his subject make their first appearance in Judaism.<br /><br />Psalm 8 is the origin of the theme that the observable design and order of nature makes it clear that a divine and beneficent God created the universe. Strangely, Ruse postpones any mention of these obvious sources of the theological side of the design argument until page 306, when he quotes a phrase from Psalm 19--much less engages in any meaningful way with the key representatives of the tradition.<br /><br />Ruse's discussion of Augustine is laughable-Augustine was indeed \\"much taken with the philosophy of Plato\\" (Page 20) but Augustine spoke/read not one word of Greek so Plato's influence on him was quite indirect, and as a former Gnostic Augustine was all too aware of the danger of creating radical distinctions between the physical world and the world of values.<br /><br />Not a word from Ruse about that, but Hans Jonas, a student of Heidegger who wrote the great The Gnostic Religion: The Message of the Alien God and the Beginnings of Christianity realized that 19th century scientific innovation was not the real reason for the era's attack on the idea of order and design in the physical universe. Jonas was a student of Heidegger, and he wrote his thesis on the Gnostics, which became the book The Gnostic Religion. Jonas was intimately familiar with the implications of Dawin on Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, and understood their impact on Heidegger. After having studied the Gnostics he asked this fundamental question:<br /><br />Let us stop to ask what has here happened to the old idea of the cosmos as a divinely order whole. Certainly nothing remotely comparable to modern physical science was involved in the catastrophic devaluation and spiritual denudation of the universe. We need only observe that this universe became thoroughly demonized in the Gnostic period . . . . If not science and technology, what caused, for the human groups involved, the collapse of the cosmos piety of classical civilization, on which so much of the ethics was built?<br /><br />His answer was a radical alienation that developed in late antiquity between the physical world and the world of values. Christianity, exemplified by Origen and Augustine, insisted on the synthesis between the physical world and the realm of values. This is the real story which should have been told in Ruse's first chapters.<br /><br />For example, his quotations from Lucretius and Hume make a point very different than the one he is trying to make. The issue about chaos or design is ancient (which is obvious to anyone with a passing familiarity with the Western tradition), and hasn't really changed much; partisans of both sides have risen in almost every generation. The fact that Hume sounds Darwinian only shows that Darwin fit a metaphysical template over a set of physical facts to make a heuristic point every bit as speculative as any Church dogma.<br /><br />In any case, a force just as powerful as the skepticism of Hume and Spinoza in the attack on design arose from the ethical critique of Voltaire, and it is the moral critique that is probably the more influential one. Ruse waits until his last chapter to address this point, which is revealing because Darwin's biography seems to indicate that the ethical argument was decisive on his views about the existence of a divine creator. Ruse also acknowledges at the end of his book that Dawkins has been deeply influenced by the ethical issue as well. Why does Ruse park the discussion of such an influential issue at the back of his book?<br /><br />The moral or ethical critique is the issue about how a God powerful enough to create the universe could permit the unspeakable suffering evident everywhere. The publication of Candide in 1759 was a devastating indictment of design on these ethical grounds.<br /><br />Indeed, the death of Darwin's daughter--ie his personal reaction to the problem of inexplicable suffering-seems to have been a major factor in Darwin's personal loss of religious faith. He also comments in his writings (I can't remember where) in relation to a particularly horrible parasitic relationship between host and parasite, that he couldn't imagine how anyone could be aware of it and believe in a good creator God.<br /><br />These are theological views, not scientific views. As such, they are answerable with theological responses. Darwinists ignore the doctrine of the Fall in their theological speculations. The doctrine of the Fall teaches that Satan corrupted creation and triggered the introduction of diseases, the redefinition of the relations between animals into the relationship of predator and prey, and other calamities which distorted the original natural order of the physical world. Paul famously describes the effects of Satan's intervention in the natural world in his letter to the Romans:<br /><br />For the anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now. (Chapter 8)<br /><br />Of course, this is theology, but so are Darwin's (and Dawkins's) sweeping statements, and if Darwin and Dawkins were moved to speculate about God's motives, why should they ignore a 3,000 year old tradition that declares that the natural world is strongly influenced by the adversary of God?<br /><br />But the metaphysical assertions of Darwinism are nothing new, they are merely the other side of an ancient tradition. Nor is it news that every living being who is born must die. What was innovative was Darwin's decision to focus on death and the killing process as the efficient causes of the world we see around us, indeed the secret mechanism for the development of living beings.<br /><br />Jonas makes interesting points in his Phenomenon of Life about how Darwinism in effect makes death and killing the creative force itself, and by asserting that adaptations were mutations, Darwinism destroyed any sense of an \\"essence of being\\" in its traditional, noble meaning. As Darwin wrote, \\"Thus from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely the production of the higher animals, directly follows (Page 649)\\", and this vision is the heart of the challenge posed by Darwinism to traditional ethics.<br /><br />Darwin's belief in death and killing as the underlying creative force in the natural world is the lodestar of Darwinism; everything else about the theory has changed and changed again since the publication of The Origin of Species, but the idea that evolution occurs as a result of adaptation through natural selection, with the elimination of beings with less-efficient adaptations, remains the key idea. I'm not sure whether science has confirmed that Darwin's Malthusian logic is true for the animal world (it turned out not to be true with respect to humans), but in any event Darwin's emphasis on death rather than on life is the most enduring aspect of his Weltanshaung:<br /><br />All that we can do, is to keep steadily in mind that each organic being is striving to increase in a geometrical ratio; that each at some period of its life, during some season of the year, during each generation or at intervals, has to struggle for life and to suffer great destruction. When we reflect on this struggle we may console ourselves with the full belief, that the war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply. (Page 106)<br /><br />What is particularly sinister is the solace Darwin offers his reader in the last sentence. This is not science, this is a dark theology.<br /><br />Why did I react at such length to a mediocrity like Ruse? Because Ruse is a committed partisan and popularizer of misleading ideas-and by this I don't refer to scientific ideas-that have already caused humanity much sorrow. He acknowledges that Darwinism is a theology of death and then basically advises his reader to accept it as fact and move on. Like the follower and the sheep that he is, Ruse heads right down the well-trodden path to disaster pioneered by his intellectual betters. His final comment is a perfect expression of his limitations and poor judgment:<br /><br />\\"This is what makes it all meaningful to the believer. Not proof, but simply flooding, overwhelming experience that could not be denied. In Raven's words . . . 'Here is beauty-whatever the philosophies and art critics who have never looked at a moth may say-beauty that rejoices and humbles, beauty remote from all that is meant by words like random or purposelessness, utilitarian or materialistic, beauty in its impact and effects akin to the authentic encounter with God.'  I have nothing more to add. (Page 336)\\"<br /><br />Indeed not--Nietzsche concluded that transcendent values did not exist, and that all existing religions and systems of meaning were an illusion. Where did he look to find meaning?

US	53090123	R901MOTDFCD7M	0393319636	717947913	The Widow's Children: A Novel	Books	4	22	23	N	N	A Dance of Death	That was how the New York Times book reviewer characterized this novel in 1976 when it was first published, and \\"A Dance of Death\\" remains an insightful summary of both the plot and the atmosphere of Paula Fox's most autobiographical novel (the only one that comes close in this respect is THE WESTERN COAST).<br /><br />Paula Fox has been quoted in an interview objecting to her novels being described as \\"depressing\\", but whether she likes it or not, her superbly realized works portray an extremely bleak universe.  Like the work of the otherwise very different writer Isaac Babel (his collected Short Stories are available on Amazon.com), the world portrayed by Fox is one of distinctive aesthetic beauty, but it is also a terrible world that is indifferent to human suffering.<br /><br />Readers of Paula Fox's memoir BORROWED FINERY discovered with shock how autobiographical Fox's novels are, particularly THE WESTERN COAST and THE WIDOW'S CHILDREN.  BORROWED FINERY is, in effect, the Bible of Fox's life-a sparsely depicted, highly condensed version of the truth uncluttered by detail which would have been impossible for the author to actually recall, while her novels are Fox's Homeric ILIAD and ODYSSEY-richly detailed, splendidly evoked works of art that, while based on historical truth, are filled with sumptuous detail and splendid turns of phrase and are, first and foremost, aesthetic masterworks.<br /><br />At the center of WIDOW'S CHILDREN is the dead widow's formidable daughter Laura Maldonado, who is the image of Paula Fox's real-life mother Elsie de Sola.  Laura is a beautiful, cruel almost inhuman character in the mold of Clytemnestra and Medea, and like them she is a giver and a taker of life.  Like Paula Fox's real mother, Laura Maldonado had four abortions until, the fifth time, she discovered her pregnancy a month too late and her daughter Clara was born.  Clara is modeled on Paula Fox herself.  The novel starts out as Greek tragedy but ends up being twisted into something else, something more superficially uplifting but, in the end, less complete.<br /><br />As the novel opens, Laura has called a family gathering in Manhattan to celebrate Laura's departure for a trip to Africa with her second husband Desmond.  Just before her brother Carlos, her daughter Clara and her old friend Peter Rice arrive at her hotel suite, Laura takes a phone call and learns that her aged mother, the widow of the title, has died in an old age home.  Laura decides to conceal this knowledge from her husband and everyone else, and so the evening begins.  Fox revealed in her memoir that much of THE WIDOW'S CHILDREN is based on actual events in her life, and it is clear that not being told about her grandmother's death was one of the great traumas in her life.<br /><br />The relationship between truth and imagination produce a deeper truth.  Most of THE WIDOW'S CHILDREN can be mapped directly onto the actual events depicted in BORROWED FINERY-Laura is Elsie, Peter Hansen is Paul Fox, Clara is Paula, Eugenio is Fermin and Carlos is Paula's favourite, and flamboyantly gay, uncle Leopoldo, etc.  But the fundamental achievement of Fox in this novel is to imaginatively enter the mind and heart of her abusive, cruel and demonically attractive mother Elsie through the vividly evoked character Laura.  It is a magnificent aesthetic achievement and it must have been a source of psychological healing for Paula Fox.  This accounts for the mesmerizing, if repellent first 60% of the novel.<br /><br />But then Paula Fox veers away from the deeply cruel and sad facts of her life and constructs a happier ending in which Clara successfully confronts her mother with the help of a character apparently modeled on the real life Elwood Corning, a kindly minister who intervened in the real Paula Fox's life when she was an abandoned young girl.  As the novel veers in this happier direction and builds towards its climax, an eerie thing happens which does not appear to be part of the intentional effects executed by this very experienced and accomplished novelist.<br /><br />In the early chapters of WIDOW'S CHILDREN, through a feat of sympathetic imagination (and considerable psychological courage), Fox re-created her terrible mother in the character of Laura.  But the final chapters focus on Clara, who is based on Paula Fox herself, and her ally Peter Rice, a character based on her original rescuer Elwood Corning.  But weirdly, just as Fox focuses the novel on this image of herself, the novel becomes superficial and vague and unconvincing.  The ferocious dynamism of the novel's early chapters is lost.  Paradoxically, the invented material about Fox's mother is more convincing than the material based on the author's own feelings and inner world!  Laura is alive and unforgettable in a way that Clara, although she starts out that way, is not.  A very strange result, and one which, unfortunately, undercuts the aesthetic achievement of THE WIDOW'S CHILDREN.  It also raises the question of to what degree Paula Fox inherited, or began to absorb, her mother Elsie's character, abandoning the hapless innocence of Clara in WIDOW'S CHILDREN (and of the character Annie Gianfala in WESTERN COAST).<br /><br />This novel is unusual and does not provide many of the traditional pleasures of literature, while others it lavishes in superabundance.  Only certain readers will have a taste for it, but it is a remarkable book.  It is perhaps fitting to conclude with another biographical note:  Elsie is the great-grandmother, and Paula Fox, is the grandmother, of Courtney Love.ear to be part of the intentional effects executed by this very experienced and accomplished novelist. <br /> <br />In the early chapters of WIDOW'S CHILDREN, through a feat of sympathetic imagination (and considerable psychological courage), Fox re-created her terrible mother in the character of Laura.

US	53090123	R3H2OIO3QZQM7Y	0679432949	823474084	Family Circle: The Boudins and the Aristocracy of the Left	Books	5	21	34	N	N	The tragic vision of the Left	This fascinating book will make uncomfortable reading for committed progressives, so I am not surprised by the many negative reviews.  Progressives no doubt also loathe David Horowitz's book RADICAL SON, which was a thoughtful description of the underside of the idealistic 1960s and its aftermath.  FAMILY CIRCLE covers similar material and provides much food for thought.<br /><br />What both books make clear is that it was not a coincidence that idealistic progressives with a particular group of personal qualities and beliefs morphed into violent domestic terrorists, despite their early idealism and desire to help make a better world.<br /><br />The key elements seem to be:<br /><br />(1) Legitimate, but blown out of proportion, social grievance<br /><br />The terrorists who formed the Weathermen Underground:  Boudin, Dohrn and Ayers and their comrades were initially motivated by legitimate issues. Their original issue was the shameful treatment of black Americans by the white American majority, and subsequently their other major focus was their opposition to the Vietnam War.<br /><br />But what was the connection between the awareness of legitimate social issues and the decision to kill other human beings? The link is by no means obvious, and few individuals who shared similar outrage over the same injustices took the step of turning to violence.<br /><br />(2) Family values that justify treason or violent revolt<br /><br />One of the best predicters of an individual's political party affiliation is the political affiliation of their parents. This is a somewhat humiliating confirmation of Schopenhauer's contemptuous (but overly sweeping) dismissal of the idea of free will, and it turns out to be particularly important when the political behaviour involved is extreme. When an individual decides to set out to kill people and become an enemy to one's society and government, it apparently helps to have deep, subconscious confidence in the support of loved ones for those violent acts.<br /><br />Kathy Boudin's parents (like David Horowitz's parents) were Communists and her father Leonard was a famous radical lawyer who defended many Communists and traitors who have subsequently, since the opening of KGB files after the fall of the USSR, been proven to have been guilty--a fact that Leonard, who was hostile to his adopted USA, probably knew when he was defending them. Tragically, Leonard Boudin went from defending Fidel Castro in the late 1950s to unsuccessfully defending his daughter Kathy in the early 1980s from charges that arose out of her participation in the violent robbery of a Brinks truck and the murders of a Brinks guard and two policemen.<br /><br />So just as Microsoft founder Bill Gates' father was a prominent and wealthy Seattle lawyer, it seems that that treason and terrorism often reach full flower in the nurtured next generation.<br /><br />But what were the values that these families specifically inculcated in their children?<br /><br />(3) Heroic immortality and hedonism<br /><br />Boudin's father was a materialist and a Communist who was flagrantly sexually omnivorious--behaviour that was well known to his family.<br /><br />The great advantage of being a materialist with no belief in the after life like Boudin and her father is that one doesn't have any eternal punishment to endure for one's earthly actions.  In fact, it is a very liberating philosophy.<br /><br />In fact, weirdly, this is creates a direct connection between the Weather Underground and today's Islamic terrorists--the mullahs and extremist Islamic theologians goading young men and women to their deaths are pushing the functional equivalent of materialism and atheism.  Ironically, there is little functional difference between killing policemen in Nyack, New York because you think that after death there is nothing at all, and blowing yourself up in an Israeli shopping mall because you think you'll spend eternity having sex with virgins.<br /><br />The multi-partner sex that was practiced as part of their political indoctrination by the Weathermen Underground had the same function as the mullahs' loopy lure to suicide bombing.<br /><br />Both sets of political killers expected to be remembered for their heroic acts of violence, and to either experience extinguished consciousness after years of hedonistic sex, or to be about to embark on an eternity of hedonistic sex. A truly wierd confluence of the motivations of Western domestic terrorists and Islamic terrorists.<br /><br />Of course, if Islamic terrorists and materialist Western traitors and terrorists are attracted to sexual hedonism with no fear of any consequences, so are many if not most ordinary people who don't go on to kill innocent strangers. What is the final link?<br /><br />(4) Grandiosity and psychopathic narcissism<br /><br />Why was Kathy Boudin a convicted killer and pleasure-seeking Mick Jagger not a killer? (Boudin denies any active role in the murders, but other witnesses claim that she played the key role of persuading the police officers to put down their weapons just before the Black Panthers attacked with automatic weapons blazing).<br /><br />The answer is contained in a statement that Kathy Boudin made during her ultimately successful quest for parole after 20 years' imprisonment, which was not included in FAMILY CIRCLE but is still available on the Web.  She wrote,<br /><br />\\"Sitting with young women dying of AIDS, creating a quilt for those in our community who are no longer with us, I face the deaths for which I am responsible. As I work with mothers on rebuilding their relationships with the children they left, I am overwhelmed by my own responsibility for leaving a group of children with no hope of ever seeing their own fathers again. Now I can ask: what if it were my father, my husband, or my son who had been killed or hurt? What would I feel? I understand the rage that the victims' families may feel towards me. \\"<br /><br />Terrorists have no regard for the feelings and sufferings of the human beings they are about to maim or kill, or for the grief of the loved ones of their victims.  This is a key component of the psychological make-up of psychopaths--an inability to emphathise with other human beings, or an evil pleasure from inflicting pain. Most terrorists probably do not derive pleasure from inflicting pain--although their controllers and motivators may well be psychopaths in this sense--but they are so narcissistic that the are indifferent to the pain inflicted on others by their murderous actions.<br /><br />An ordinary human being may be narcissistic, but only a criminal or a terrorist is psychopathically narcissistic to the point that they are indifferent to the suffering of the people whom they kidnap, maim or kill.

His decades of writing comedy are apparent in this masterful memoir, not because there are funny passages in the book, although there are, but because of his superb ability to see into the heart of a dramatic situation and to tell the story well.  Somebody said that a sense of humour is a sense of perspective, and Hendra has perspective on many aspects of the complex, subtle, and powerfully moving story of his soul's interaction with the great spiritual mentor Father Joseph Warrilow.<br />This is a book that every reader will come to terms with in their own way, so I will confine myself to a few general  remarks.  It is amazing how vividly Hendra recalls the crucial events that led up to, and included his encounter with Father Joe, which occurred 40 years ago.  These life changing experiences are recounted in a way that is cinematic and vivid--totally opposite to the vagueness with which he recounts the sex, drugs and rock n'roll period that constituted much of his adulthood.  Secondly, this book threatens to turn into a \\"I screwed up my first marriage but then I figured out what I did wrong through my wonderful second marriage to my wonderful, and much younger, second wife\\" (in this part of the book, Hendra ironically echoes Joe Esterhazy's recent memoir Hollywood Animal)--but then Hendra has another plot surprise up his sleeve which rescues his book from these doldrums and takes it back to its former, superb level.<br />My final comment, which may sound ungrateful coming from a reader who absolutely loved this wonderful book, is that while Father Joe comes across as a great man, the author himself remains somewhat unlikeable, despite the transformations caused by Father Joe's decades of patient mentoring. The book has been compared to The Confessions of Augustine, but if this comparision is partly true, it is because of how it reveals the spiritual greatness of Father Joe, not because of what it reveals about the spiritual qualities of Hendra, who remains a sort of spiritual Everyman or Homer Simpson.

Janigian writes wonderfully vivid prose, he is a talented story teller, and he clearly signals his intention in this book to grapple with big issues in his writing.<br />In this novel, Janigian evokes with confident mastery the milieu of the San Joaquin Valley at the middle of the last century, and he deftly ties together the relatively unknown sufferings of the Armenians in the first modern genocide with the outlook and behaviour of their American descendents.  Difficult subject matter, ably handled by the thoughtful and talented Janigian.<br />The novel is worth reading for its many excellences, but one of the pleasures of BLOODVINE is the exciting sense that one is experiencing a new voice for the first time, one that will only increase in artistic power and range in future novels.  It may be that a copy of this first edition of BLOODVINE, like a first edition of Saul Bellow's or Philip Roth's first novels, will one day be a coveted part of the collection of serious readers.	2004-03-05

What they add up to is that Wagner is an important novelist who is telling the truth about certain kinds of lives that are lived in Los Angeles and other parts of America in the early twenty first century.  He can be entertaining, but he aspires to do more than that, and on the whole, despite the many flaws in his novels, he succeeds.<br />Wagner is immensely gifted--he can write superb prose, he creates fascinating characters, and he knows how to tell a story.  He is also stretching, really stretching, to address life's most profound issues, and if he doesn't quite pull it off--as the understandable complaints from other reviewers about his depiction of Buddhism indicate--he is certainly artistically courageous.<br />Of course he has weaknesses--he over-writes: his prose often  needs pruning and at least 30% of the overall length of his second and third novels are hard to justify; he has a serious anti-woman issue; his subject matter can be extreme--one often rises from a session reading a Wagner novel with a strong urge to take a long hot shower; and despite the fact that he obviously knows how to tell a story, his plots tend to flag severely in the middle of his novels, picking up (but not always) in the last 25%.<br />This complex of strengths and weaknesses means that Wagner is not all that accessible, which is why some of his less committed readers are disappointed.  But he is trying to tell us something real about the times in which we live.  He is seriously talented.  He is one of the few important newish novelists writing in America today.	2004-03-05

Its strengths are all associated with its depiction of the milieu in which he moved so effortlessly, the upper class institutions of England which he betrayed.<br /><br />The author, a product of St. Paul and Oxford, is an excellent writer and an indefatigable researcher.  Her style is mellow and balanced--her analysis subtlely and consistently biased in favour of Mr. Blunt.  The only time her mellifluous prose veers into ascerbity is when referring to Mr. Blunt's detractors, including Brown, Deacon, and the various former KGB operatives who have written memoirs.  Their opinions, Ms. Carter assures us, are unreliable, badly researched, poorly judged, and so on.<br /><br />But not to worry--Ms. Carter does have the facts, and, she assures us, the proper perspective on Blunt's actions.  Despite her many portentuous references to KGB archives, most of her research is based upon secondary sources, a great deal of which is journalism, and on interviews with people to whom she gained access no doubt because of her social background and elite education.<br /><br />And these sections of the book are indeed fascinating:  Ms. Carter refers authoritatively to climates of opinion in the English upper classes that allegedly prevailed during periods before she was born.  Her account sometimes reads like it was written by a contemporary of Anthony Blunt's, one with a remarkably benevolent attitude towards the traitor.  This authenticity of tone is a testament to Ms. Carter's long years of research and her supple and even-tempered prose. It is also a testament, however inadvertant, to the tolerant, clubby upper class climate which allowed a traitor like Blunt to flourish for so long.<br /><br />On the surface, the purpose of this book is to present a balanced judgment on the life and deeds of Anthony Blunt.  Its rhetoric is indeed a model of moderate, even-tempered balance.  But that is not the character of the book, nor is a balanced account its true purpose.  What this book actually represents is an example of what it sets out to document--the extraordinarily forgiving attitude of the English upper classes to the Cambridge spies who betrayed their country.<br /><br />It can only be hoped that its appealing surfaces will not persuade the public to accept this Blunt biography as anything other than an all-too-refined case of special pleading on behalf of a cunning, unrepentent, and all-too-refined traitor to his country.model of moderate, even-tempered balance.

US	53090123	R2VLE1JWTZSEU4	1585673455	429992226	Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics	Books	4	13	29	N	N	Fascinating but off-putting	Spotts has written an important book that initially seems to be a contribution to an understanding of how the power of aesthetics strengthened the strange fascination exerted by Adolf Hitler over the Germans in the 1930s.  Indeed, the book goes a long way towards correcting dismissive interpretations of Hitler the aesthete as a mere painter of poor quality watercolours.<br />The material in this book is fascinating and disturbing, and yet there is something unsettling about the book itself.  Somehow, the book seems to disengage Hitler's aesthetics from his murderous insanity as if the two aspects of his personality were totally unrelated; what begins as a discussion of how aesthetics contributed to Hitler's ability to overmaster an entire nation and lead that nation on an epic rampage of murder and destruction turns into something else.<br />There is a curious absence of perspective in Spotts' discussion of Hitler's aesthetic interests.  Partly this is because of the narrow focus of the book on aesthetics, which is fair enough, even if, over hundreds of pages, this approach starts to make Hitler seem like simply a bit of a petulant aesthete, not unlike a Renaissance Prince. But there is more to it than this.<br />It wasn't until page 332, for example, that Spotts explicitly contrasted Hitler's aesthetic activity with a direct reference to his inhuman politics: \\"At the very time he was doing away with democracy and civil liberties, establishing concentration camps, crushing trade unions, instituting anti-Semitic policies and so on . . . \\" (Spotts' casual \\"and so on\\" is part of the problem . . . )<br />Perhaps Spotts simply hasn't thought very deeply about his subject matter.  Despite an extended and fascinating discussion of Hitler's architectural influences and goals, for example, Spotts doesn't contrast the irony of Hitler's lust to build huge granite edifices intended to preserve his memory for a thousand years with the shabby, hastily-built wooden barracks and barbed wire fences of the concentration camps that will, indeed, make his name infamous as long as human memory persists.<br />And yet the data that Spotts has uncovered and presented is almost unfailingly fascinating. The first sections \\"The Reluctant Dictator\\", \\"The Artful Leader\\", and \\"The Artist of Destruction\\" are all fascinating, and the account does recover after the two strangely offkey sections on music \\"The Perfect Wagnerite\\" and \\"The Music Master\\". The last section \\"The Master Builder\\" is better balanced with the relevant context of Hitler's sinister political crimes.<br />Given the quality of the analysis, and the richness of the information that Spotts presents, it seems increasingly odd that an author who presents such an original and detailed perspective on Hitler's aesthetic interests never attempts to reconcile his aesthetic interests with his staggering crimes.  The failure to establish and consistently maintain a broader perspective on Hitler's inhumanity makes the book an uncertain authority on the very power of aesthetics which is its subject.<br />Earlier on, Spotts describes the dismissals of Jewish artists, composers, critics, conductors, the hounding out of Germany of other artistic figures whom the Nazis considered politically unreliable, and the plundering of (mostly Jewish) art collections found in conquered countries, and he describes how a few bad Nazis were permitted to perform because Hitler approved of them as artists, while a few good Nazis had their careers blighted by Hitler's aesthetic repugnance. Yawning behind these quibbling examples--which Spotts foregrounds with an emphasis that makes it appear that aesthetics may have had some humanising influence on Hitler--is the vast abyss of Auschwitz.<br />The nadir of the book is Spotts's discussion of Wagner, and this seems to be the key to the troublingly erratic moral compass of the book: Spotts is obviously a Wagner partisan, having written a book about the Bayreuth Festival. His flat conclusion at the end of that chapter \\"Hitler's Wagner was an opera composer, not a political mentor\\" is contradicted by Spotts' comment that Hitler was so moved by the flames and destruction of the \\"Goetterdaemmerung\\" that he kissed Frau Wagner's hand (page 235). He contradicts himself again in the curiously limp afterward when he observes that the Wagner opera Rienzi \\"did indeed foretell Hitler's destiny\\" (page 401). Spotts also falls into, at best, extremely poor taste in the Wagner chapter, when he summarises Hitler's musical taste by parodying the famous chapter on love in I Corinthians 13: \\"So, in the course of [Hitler's] life, there were Wagner, Bruckner and Lehar, these three; but at the end, the greatest of these was Lehar.\\" (page 263). Spotts actually seems to be trying to make the point that Wagner's music inspired Hitler when he was triumphantly dealing out destruction and death across Europe, but that once the tide turned he couldn't bear any longer the music that had inspired him in his early dreams of homicidal glory. The problem for Spotts is that he is simultaneously advancing the thesis that Wagner's music had nothing to do with Hitler's policies, and so he evades this contradiction by bringing his Wagner chapter to a dashing close--throwing dust into the reader's eyes with this ghastly bit of antic wit about \\"Wagner, Bruckner and Lehar\\" evidently in the hope that the reader doesn't think too deeply, either.<br />By all means buy this book--it is fascinating and takes the analysis of Hitler's artistic interests well beyond the \\"Hitler as lousy watercolourist\\" theme--but be aware that important context is missing in the analysis, and be prepared to read more widely to address this deficiency.  Spotts' compelling revelations of Hitler's aesthetic interests, which have been dismissed for 50 years partly because they seem incompatible with his crimes, now force us to attempt to understand how Hitler could also have had an authentic artistic sensibility.  The world has dealt with this paradox by pretending that the artistic sensibility didn't exist; Spotts, to his credit, has closed off this option once and for all, but in his own wrestling with this paradox, he seems to have de-emphasised Hitler's crimes.flat conclusion at the end of that chapter \\"Hitler's Wagner was an opera composer, not a political mentor\\" is contradicted by Spotts' comment that Hitler was so moved by the flames and destruction of the \\"Goetterdaemmerung\\" that he kissed Frau Wagner's hand (page 235).

He certainly doesn't pull any punches, and is unsparing on the moral failings of his fellow Germans in the early 1930s.  This book was written in 1939, shortly after the author's escape to England.  Although Haffner became a distinguished journalist and historian, he never published this book during his lifetime; it was discovered by his son and published after the author's death at the age of 91.  Perhaps, like many war veterans, the experiences tangled up with the manuscript were so painful and so personal that the author couldn't bear to revisit them (a chapter was published on the 50th anniversary of an event that it describes).<br />What Haffner--and his son, who is the assured and elegant translator--have given us is one of the most compelling and insightful descriptions of the period that has been written.  It can only be compared to the diary of Otto Klemperer as a revelatory description of how a nation of people, not so different from other nations at the time or indeed of any nation today, could descend into barbarism and criminality on the vast scale of the Third Reich.<br />From the opening sentence the 1920s and 30s in Germany is evoked:  \\"This is the story of a duel.\\"  Specialists will be aware of the importance of actual duelling in middle and upper class German society as late at WWI, and its endurance as a symbol thereafter, and with this characterisation of his personal struggle against the Nazi State, Haffner seductively invites his reader into the authentic atmosphere of the period.<br />Scholars who have thought deeply about the Nazi period recognise it as the final culminating phase of a second Thirty Year's War that began in 1914; indeed, Haffner's explanation for the Nazi catastrophe is based upon his view that the generation who grew up during WWI, NOT the soldiers but the children who experienced the excitement but not the misery and death, were the key constituency for the Nazis.<br />Haffner's use of generational analysis is a powerful conceptual tool that is much more understood and accepted these days--Brokaw's \\"The Greatest Generation\\", however correct or incorrect it may be, has been a huge best seller--and Haffner in 1939 stumbled upon this type of analysis as he sought to describe how Hitler had come to power.<br />\\"Defying Hitler\\" is also the intense, personal description of the crisis that Haffner and his family and friends underwent during the rise of Hitler, conveyed with the power of a novelist.  Haffner succeeds in humanising the Germans he knew and lived among without ever downplaying the horror of the decisions that they made, as he shows that it was all too clear what the consequences of those decisions were likely to be.<br />This is a unique book and it is highly recommended for both readers who have read almost nothing about the period, as well as readers who are thoroughly familiar with the subject, and yet are still trying to come to terms with how such a terrible catastrophe could occur in a civilised nation.were the key constituency for the Nazis.<br />Haffner's use of generational analysis is a powerful conceptual tool that is much more understood and accepted these days--Brokaw's \\"The Greatest Generation\\", however correct or incorrect it may be, has been a huge best seller--and Haffner in 1939 stumbled upon this type of analysis as he sought to describe how Hitler had come to power.<br />\\"Defying Hitler\\" is also the intense, personal description of the crisis that Haffner and his family and friends underwent during the rise of Hitler, conveyed with the power of a novelist.

Ettinger's book is a brief and restrained account of a characteristically German sentimental relationship which obviously had a strong long term impact on the thought of Hannah Arendt.  The fact that Arendt, a fully assimilated German of Jewish origin, could enter so fully into a relationship of this nature,  which is so typically a phenomenon of the Romantic German milieu, is both poignant and a profound rebuke to the obscene anti-Semitism from which she and so many millions suffered.<br />The Heidegger-Arendt love affair has much of the power of  the great Abelard and Heloise love affair, with which it has strong affiinities.<br />Given the fact that the letters on which this book is based are intimate, and, in Arendt's case at least, were in many cases written by a young and still unformed intellect, Ettinger seems to have exercised great restraint and avoided scoring cheap points by being unsympathetic towards the excesses of the letter writers.<br />Ettinger does not flinch from contrasting Arendt's tormented and difficult-to-defend collaboration in Heidegger's post-War rehabilitation with Jaspers's principled and unyielding refusal to re-establish his relationship with Heidegger unless Heidegger rejected the Nazi Party and its crimes--which he never did, in private or public.<br />This is not a profound study--it is a refreshingly light 139 pages or so.  But it accomplishes what it sets out to do:  provide a preliminary account of a startling and anguished love affair which has an almost symbolic quality to it.<br />The only reason it doesn't get five stars is because of the extremely limited quotations from the letters themselves, which was probably a condition imposed on Ettinger by the Hannah Arendt Literary Trust.	2002-01-12

Many reviewers of both this book and the author's previous book on the Tanakh (aka God: A Biography) evidently assume that there is something whimsical, shallow and capricious--even blasphemous--about Miles' meditation on the evolving character within history of the God of the Old Testament, and in this book, of God Incarnate as he is revealed in the New Testament. On the contrary, while highly original and beautifully written, to a Nietzchean level which is capable of glossing over weak or even dangerous arguments with lovely and sometimes thrilling prose--this book is in fact fundamentally grounded in some of the most recent, and exciting works of Biblical scholarship written in the last decade or so.<br />Before questioning the author's intentions, it might be wise to read two splendid commentaries on the New Testament, Moloney's commentary on the Gospel of John and Byrne's commentary on Romans, both published as part of the Catholic &quot;Sacra Pagina&quot; series and available on Amazon. These commentaries address the profound harmonies between Judaism and Christianity, and provide plenty of objective buttressing for the arguments put forward in a very readable and thought-provoking way by Miles.<br />It is true that the idea which Miles may consider the keynote of his thesis--his revision of the doctrine of atonement--will be rejected by believing Christians, and there is certainly nothing in the above-mentioned commentaries that supports Miles on that point.  But this is a clearly demarcated part of his thesis, and the close and fascinating reading of the New Testament, principally the Gospel of John, that emerges from Miles' analysis follows the Scripture closely and is unrelated to Miles' unnecessarily provocative original contribution to the doctrine of atonement.<br />Often Miles adopts a rhetorical strategy that seems to distance himself from Christian belief, but this is generally  a pose which allows him to maintain his scholarly credentials while taking the Scripture at face value.  It might also be useful to read Leo Strauss's &quot;Persecution and the Art of Writing&quot; in order to understand Miles' strategy of creating enough intellectual elbow-room amidst the aridity and reductionism of historical Biblical criticism in order to propose his creative and generally reverent ideas.<br />Enjoy Miles's dazzling intellectual performance, but take him seriously as well. This is a very stimulating work that has an important place in the evolving reconciliation between Christianity and Judaism.  One does not have to agree with everything in it to enjoy many benefits from Miles' thinking.

It is an extraordinary account of personal combat experience from World War I, written by a truly heroic young soldier who was awarded the highest honor for outstanding valour, the Pour le Merite, or Blue Max.<br />The author, Ernst Juenger, was also a gifted writer who created an incredibly vivid and gripping account of his experiences.  The only memoir that deserves to be considered its peer is Erwin Rommel's memoirs of his service as a young officer in World War I , published in English as Infantry Attacks.  Rommel also won the Blue Max.<br />Unlike Rommel's book, which reads like a primer for fighting effectively as an infantry officer, &quot;The Storm of Steel&quot; incorporates an almost philosophical endorsement of the heroic life and its values. This sounds positive, but Juenger vividly portrays what a heroic life is really about:  slaughtering other human beings, callousness, incredible courage, disregard for one's own life.  In practice, a troubling collection of proficiencies and character traits.<br />The culture that produced such a cool and talented soldier was also the culture that tragically curdled into the Nazi nightmare.  No reader will have the answer to how the two phenemona are connected; no reader should avoid posing the question.	2001-06-01

This novel was written with an explicitly political purpose--to criticise the heavy handed, inept foreign policy of  the US in Asia in the 1950s, to warn that it was about  to precipitate a disaster, and to offer a better alternative.  The book was a huge best seller in its day--I remember copies in peoples' houses in the 1960s.<br />Unhappily, its sound message was ignored by those whose policies were criticised, and as a result the American people found themselves in the Vietnam War.<br />The novel belongs with Animal Farm and Brave New World as a work of fiction that has a primary purpose unrelated to art, but it is an engaging and entertaining novel as well.<br />Reading it, however, in the knowledge that its accurate and timely diagnosis of a failed policy was ignored, is a sorrowful experience.	2001-05-22

If you read those verses and pray the prayer contained in 4:10, you will begin to embark on an exciting new adventure in your life's service to God.<br />To help understand why the changes are taking place, you should read Bruce Wilkinson's book.  Wilkinson didn't invent the prayer and he didn't pluck something obscure out of the Bible and then twist its meaning to suit his own purposes.  The fact is, he came across this prayer through a seminary chaplain early in his life, and he has been meditating and reflecting on its power for decades as he has experienced the changes in his life that this prayer can make.<br />In this book, Wilkinson thoughtfully and reverently offers his own insights into the kind of loving, joyful relationship with God that is expressed in this prayer.  God himself already understands its dynamics, of course, and by praying this prayer you will begin to grow in your spiritual life and in your contribution to the lives of others.  But if you want to understand yourself, in a more conscious and structured way, why this prayer begins to align your life and its goals more closely with God's loving promises, than you should read this book.<br />Wilkinson has thrown a door open to a new, loving, creative and productive phase in your life, developed individually with your God on the basis of the relationship that this prayer begins to establish between the two of you.<br />At the very least, read 1 Chronicles 4: 9 and 10!  I was very glad that afterwards, I read this book, too.	2001-05-17

Hendrickson has caught the basic rhythm of the Vietnam War through his account of the intertwined lives of former SecDef Robert McNamara and a young Martha's Vineyard artist, a Marine helicopter crew chief, a Quaker who burned himself to death in protest of the Vietnam war, a young Catholic who went off to become a combat nurse, and a Vietnamese family torn apart by the war and the victory of the Communists.  In addition, two other characters play prominent roles, the author himself and, in a shadowy way, McNamara's son.<br />This structure allows Hendrickson to develop considerable dramatic impact as he cuts back and forth between the events of McNamara's life, and his foolish and fateful decisions, and the lives of those who were effected by McNamara and his decisions.  There is great drama and illumination in the contrast between what was happening on the ground in Vietnam, or in the lives of ordinary Americans and Vietnamese, and the remorseless but curiously blind lurching forward of the Kennedy and then Johnson/McNamara war machine.<br />Another reviewer has noted, and disapproves of, the centrality of the Quaker Norm Morrison's self-immolation virtually under McNamara's Pentagon window.  This is, in many ways, the true heart of the book.  Hendrickson seems to connect best with Morrison's life, and with his surviving family.  Morrison's example is also a powerful challenge to any reader to think through the practical implications of his personal beliefs.<br />In the end, however, Hendrickson seems to miss the deepest implications of his own research.  He is less good with the other lives:  the marine and the nurse are portrayed as earnest but ineffectual people caught up in the horror and pity of war, the sufferings of the Tranhs and the nurse are seen as inexplicable but not, finally, very interesting.  The author seems most drawn to the Morrisons, the artist, and to McNamara himself.  Hendrickson then ultimately lets McNamara off the hook in a muddy and curiously vain epilogue.  The inner nature of McNamara's crime, the moral cowardice that could not be more sharply contrasted with Morrison's death, has a form familiar to us from Hitler's Germany.  Wehrmacht General officers refused to act against their obviously criminal commander in chief because--yes, this is true--of the oath of loyalty they had sworn to Hitler.  McNamara's self-justification rests on the same avowal, the same twisted and ultimately cowardly and evil misplacement of loyalty, and Hendrickson never really probes the inhumanity lurking below McNamara's ability to do so.<br />The reporting, which overall is excellent, on these matters belies the analysis itself, the flaws of which are sometimes concealed under the author's engaging but occasionally over-the-top rhetoric.  This book remains vivid and powerful, one that points the way forward and is very rewarding in itself, but which cannot be considered, despite its many excellences, the final word on the man McNamara or his war.mara himself.

The format of the  book is extremely helpful as well--clear, logically laid out, and the relationship between text and commentary is robust and very useful for both the casual browser and the scholar seeking to elucidate a particular passage.<br />One of the most interesting features of this commentary are the author's thoughts on one of the thorniest, but potentially most exciting issues in Christian theology today--the relationship between early Christianity and Judaism.  There is much misunderstanding and sorrow associated with this subject, and there have been extremely exciting and potentially healing advances made in the scholarship in this area over the last twenty years or so.<br />This book can serve as an introduction to, or a companion to, the books of Krister Stendhal, W.D. Davies (including the Cambridge History of Judaism which he edited), E.P. Sanders, and others from the Christian side, as well as the works of Segal, Mark Nanos and Daniel Boyarin from the Jewish side.  Paul's central role in the relationship between Judaism and Christianity--much misunderstood--is well worth revisiting, and has implications for the spiritual life and personal conduct of any reader today.<br />This is a humane, stimulating and apposite work.  Highly recommended!	2001-04-24

First, it must be said that this book shares many of the same strengths and weaknesses of Sheehan's A Bright, Shining Lie and Halberstam's The Best and the Brightest.  This is not coincidental, as Prochnau is clearly in their intellectual debt, if not totally immersed in hero-worship of his fellow journalists.  So, the reader can expect great information on daily life in Vietnam during the early 60s, lots of fascinating details and anecdotes on the players who were somehow caught up in the early history of the U.S. involvement, and plenty of good war stories, some new, some re-told (but re-told well).  This is a well-written book at the rhetorical level.<br />The problem is at the deeper level of the author's thesis.  In an ancient division of labour, Achilles fought, and Homer sang songs about Achilles' bravery.  In our times, the Homers of the media can't help calling attention to themselves, and to their own hardships and their own bravery.  No doubt they excelled the average bear in these respects, but a journalist certainly didn't face the same degree of danger and discomfort, day in day out, as the troopers they reported on.  When Prochnau isn't busy making this silly point, he provides plenty of evidence about the journalist's daily routines in the bars and cafes of Saigon, their Vietnamese girlfriends, their embassy parties, etc. to make it clear that they didn't actually share the same conditions as the soldiers.  But this gets lost in the over-arching glorification of the journalists.  The book becomes truly absurd in this respect when it suggests that the Vietnam War might have taken a different course if David Halberstam hadn't been a war correspondent for 18 months in Vietnam in the early 60s.  Even granted the influence of the press, what about Mal Browne, Horst Faas, and Peter Arnett, not to mention Neil Sheehan of UPI?<br />Finally, this book shares with Sheehan's and Halberstam's books an out-and-out condemnation of the U.S. Army.  All provide facts showing that LTCs and Colonels on down (even the occasional General) understood that a disaster was in the making (and explained it to the journalists).  But nevertheless these authors all condemn the Army as an institution.  They refuse to see that, as in Hitler's Wehrmacht, the most senior Generals were corrupted by their proximity to power, and used the command and control structure of the Army, and the ideals of loyalty and obedience, to steer the Army in the direction selected by their political masters (the plot against Hitler was essentially a plot of majors, LTCs and Colonels).  In the 60s, the Joint Chiefs and particular Generals like Taylor and Harkins were guilty of responding to the immoral and cynical commands of their political masters when they directed the Army, a vast but essentially neutral tool, into an escalating war.  Those Generals were responding to the directions of their political masters, and ignored their well-informed subordinates on the spot (and their own consciences?) in order to accomodate those directions from above.  In the case of Vietnam, whether these authors like it or not, those masters were the Democratic Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, and their advisers McNamara, et. al.cts showing that LTCs and Colonels on down (even the occasional General) understood that a disaster was in the making (and explained it to the journalists).

Unlike Miller, who tried to justify his actions, Gutierrez is brutally honest about himself.  The settings and events are often sordid and disgusting, but the narrator himself is a higher being, a refined sensibility still capable of acknowledging the truth about the actions to which he is driven.  The Dirty Havana Trilogy also recalls &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;, but  the ultra low-budget sewer that is Castro's Cuba makes the Communist Czechoslavkia of Milan Kundera's time look like Donald Trump's New York.<br />Clearly, this is not a book for those who are easily offended.  There is lots of meaningless death, meaningless sex, casually pejorative slurs on people of colour and women, descriptions of filthy and disgusting environments.  But, notwithstanding the blurbs on the dust jacket of the book, Gutierrez's work is a very moral work in the sense that any reader will clearly see the cost of such behaviour and be unlikely to imitate the narrator.<br />It would be fascinating to systematically compare this book, with its indictment of the moral choices remaining to the ordinary person living under  Casto's government, to Armando Valladares'  &quot;Against all Hope&quot;, which is also available on Amazon.com, of course.<br />This is another interesting addition to the &quot;lying in the gutter and looking at the stars&quot; genre.  Highly recommended for those who are up for it.	2001-04-16

Halberstam's basic thesis is (1) that Republicans in the McCarthy Era purged the State Department of people who understood Asia, and frightened the Democratic Party into supporting mindless anti-Communist politics in the U.S., (2) when the Kennedy Administration came to power, brutal incompetents in the military, abetted by a gutted State Department, somehow hi-jacked the Vietnam process from underneath Kennedy and McNamara's noses, and (3) succeeded, with the connivance of dim-witted or cravenly career-oriented Ambassadors, Generals, and mostly Republican hotheads lamentably brought into the Kennedy Administration, in escalating the U.S. into the quagmire of the Vietnam War.<br />The overt moral of &quot;The Best and the Brightest&quot;, underlined by its clever title, is that the supposed rationalists and pragmatists of the Kennedy Administration were too clever by half in their belief that they could co-exist with the military and Cold Warrior Republicans, who ultimately bent them to their will and forced the U.S. into the Vietnam War.<br />Just one example of how preposterously distorted Halberstam's thesis is:  Robert A. Lovett, who Halberstam portrays as an old-fashioned, courtly Democrat who was elbowed out of the way by Kennedy and his team of hard-charging pragmatists eager to appease the Republicans, was in fact the biggest support of Curtis Lemay during World War II, when LeMay pioneered the horrifically deadly fire-bombing strategy which killed more Japanese civilians than the atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.  Lovett fits right in with the Democratic establishment that blundered and deceived its way in to the fiasco of the Vietnam War, he was just a generation older than Kennedy and his guys.<br />Halberstam's attempt to stick Republicans with the blame for the Vietnam War is pretty thin gruel, disguised with lots of hearty chunks of chewy anecdotes produced by Halberstam's brilliant reporting.  It's his over-arching thesis that is flawed.  Today, it is clear that it was not the military but the civilians in the Kennedy Administration who were the bullies--willing to sick the U.S. Army onto the Vietnamese, willing to encourage the assassination of President Diem of South Vietnam, willing to do whatever it took to physically intimidate and kill any Vietnamese who got in their way. America now knows all too well that you don't call the military into a political or social situation until it is time to fight. Ironically, the major breaches of this doctrine have been under the Clinton Administration. Halberstam's account of the most politically motivated and controlled war the U.S. has ever fought brilliantly inverts the Vietnam War into a war caused by Republican and military control of a Democratic Administration. It is a fine, scintillitating performance by Halberstam, but it isn't history.<br />Halberstam and the many similar Vietnam era war correspondents never seem to be able to reconcile the fact that much of their information came from majors, LTCs, Colonels, and even the odd Brigadier General with their thesis that the War was the fault of the military, not two Democratic administrations in a row.  The real issue with the military, which is now being examined, is how physically courageous 4 star Generals were  so morally craven that they did not speak out or resign when their political masters gave them orders that they new to be fatally flawed strategically, and unconscionable morally.<br />Highlights of the book include much fine reporting and interesting Kennedy and Johnson-era gossip on figures in the establishment, a blizzard of details that disguises the mendacity and special pleading of the book's over-arching thesis. Finally, one reads the book and recalls the dictum that history repeats itself, first as tragedy and then as farce. The parallels between the Kennedy Administration and the Clinton Administration are astounding.rce.

Along with the Torah, the Iliad is one of the most inspirational texts of all time, its vivid drama suggesting a way of life for those who can attain it.  The surprisingly complex ethos of the hero comes alive, moment by shattering moment, in this great work.  As long shadowed spears hurtle through the air, arrows leap from straining bows, bronze armour clashes and men fall like great trees, the ground of life and death is portrayed in a way that is still gripping almost three thousand years later.  Men move forward towards possible death in support of their comrades and to try to win glory, or to retrieve the bodies of their fallen comrades from the plundering clutches of their killers.<br />Reasonable people differ on translations.  Having struggled through part of the original, and having read Lattimore, Fitzgerald, and a bit of Fagles, it is Lattimore who seems to capture best the vivid, occasionally gruesome, quality of the original along with its noble and transcendent  aura.	2001-02-03

Indeed, the book should be read widely, as it is a penetrating and sensitive reading of the Apostle Paul's work, and it surfaces and analyses some key issues, such as the likelihood that what led to Paul's Damascus experience was his search for an answer to the question of how the One God of Israel could deliver salvation to all the world, not just Jews but also Gentiles.  Boyarin's work is thoughtful and generous (although there is more bite in his footnotes than in the text itself).  Boyarin considers himself a post-modern Talmudic scholar, and it is the influence of Derrida and de Man, however attenuated, that lumbers his otherwise brilliant analysis.  Boyarin himself privileges, to use his own post-modern jargon, the theme of &quot;difference&quot; over all the other themes he surfaces.  This struck this reader as a passing (post-modern) fad, and these sections will date in a way that the rest of this extremely interesting book will not.	2001-01-14

The setting of Fry's heroism, Marseille and the environs of the South of France, permit an oblique perspective on the Holocaust, which unfolded principally much farther to the north and the east.  Without the overwhelming machinery of the sealed boxcars, the gas chambers, the crematoria, some of the underlying causes of the Holocaust come into focus:  the bureacratic obstructionism of the U.S. State department, motivated partly by national self interest and partly by the genteel anti-Semitism of individual Foreign Officers, provides a glimpse into how value-free institutional behaviour can be--a deadly underlying cause in Hitler's rise.  The sympathetic behaviour of peasants living on the border and of petty police officers contrasts with the callous, and often actively evil, behaviour of their official leaders.<br />But always, there is the central enigma of Varian Fry himself--a complex, difficult , troubled man, in many ways a talented failure, who because of his clear moral vision became the catalyst for saving the flower of European artists and writers from the clutches of the Gestapo and their collaborators.<br />In another book, Todorov posits that in extreme moral situations, the basic moral unit for effective action is two, because he notes that the rescuers--Gentiles who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust were rarely individuals; often they were husbands and wives.  Todorov's idea is the combination of personality traits and practical abilities that produces effective resistence to an overwhelming social climate of evil is beyond the range of a single individual, and that it requires a minimum of two people to act effectively in this kind of environment.<br />Interestingly, Fry did organise a staff of incredibly courageous co-workers to help save his &quot;clients&quot;, but the intriguing question is whether his very flaws were part of Fry's mysterious ability to distance himself from his society (ie American) and to plunge into effective action to resist Hitler's evil earlier than almost anyone else.<br />This intriguing book is very rewarding and worthwhile.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because of an occasional passage in which the author, who seems to be almost super-abundantly talented, seems to stray into almost novelistic detail that would seem unlikely to be supported by his research.

He was a man who loved life--wine, women and philosophy, but after the death of his father he retired and began these meditations on life, seeking solace in the great record of human experience found in the classics.  Montaigne wrote during the bloody religious wars of the Counter-Reformation--one of his essays describes his near death at the hands of Protestant marauders.  The combination of the highly civilised culture of the France of his day and the seething and pitiless violence that was also a fact of life was also a subject that drove him back to the classics.  These profound meditations, eternally relevant, will assist anyone who continues to reflect on the wonder and the pity of human existence.	2000-11-17

It is well known that King  plagiarised much of his academic work and many of the passages from his  sermons and speeches, but Miller compelling explains this practice as the  hallmark of the oral culture of African American religion that produced its  finest example in King himself.  Although Miller doesn't cite classical  literature, King's method of creating his own unique works from the  building blocks of others is a central and completely accepted insight into  scholarship on Homer's Odyssey and Iliad, and it is well known that  Shakespeare closely followed the plots of third rate plays to produce his  own masterpieces.<br />Miller also shows how the courageous resistance of  African Americans against centuries of slavery produced a profound gospel  of deliverance that was a concentrated version of Judeo-Christian  doctrines, pared to its essentials and vivid enough to sustain people  through seemingly hopeless injustice and oppression, indeed, with the power  to motivate people to lay down their lives, if necessary.  It was this  doctrine of deliverance that King delivered to America and the world,  electrifying the consciences and imaginations of white Americans, and  providing leadership of the highest quality to the many brave African  Americans who were determined to end the injustice of racism in  America.<br />This is a fine and inspiring book about a great American, Dr. M.

This disagreement should not be  allowed to become an obstacle to an understanding of the clear meaning of  his diaries.<br />Klemperer's diaries are magnificent and should be widely  read, not just because of their vivid and detailed account of life during  the Nazi years,  but because they are proof that the bestial violence of  the Nazis could not and did not deprive the Nazi's victims of their  humanity; many millions died and are unable to affirm this; Klemperer lived  and testifies to this truth on behalf of them all.se of their vivid and detailed account of life during  the Nazi years,  but because they are proof that the bestial violence of  the Nazis could not and did not deprive the Nazi's victims of their  humanity; many millions died and are unable to affirm this; Klemperer lived  and testifies to this truth on behalf of them all.	2000-03-25

The concept of &quot;numinous&quot; would be so satisfying to any intelligent person at the end/beginning of the millenium.  The chapters &quot;The Holy as a  Category of Value&quot;, &quot;The Numinous in the Old Testament&quot;,  &quot;The Numinous in the New Testament&quot; and the &quot;The Numinous in  Luther&quot;--with its great analysis of Plato, are deeply insightful, even  life-changing.  And the appendices are great--so learned, so relevant.	1999-06-14

The best that can be said is that (a) his translation is not too different from those of his superiors, ie Lattimore and Fitzgerald and (b) he doesn't obscure Homer's timeless achievement too much.  But there is a distinct whiff of what Nabokov called &quot;poshlost&quot; in Fagle's translation--a sort of suburban vulgarity, with its anacronisms (eg &quot;Scot-free&quot;) and casual slang.  The Fagle translation's instant reputation,  will, I am sure, fade away quickly, just another fleeting illusion successfully created by the modern American media's hype machine.  Read the Lattimore and Fitzgerald translations, both of which are available from Amazon.	1998-04-17

Auerbach, who has remained in print via his magisterial work Mimesis, also wrote this collection of essays.  In Scenes from the Drama of European Literature he manages to approach the scope of the denser Mimesis by addressing, not individual works, but great themes.  He addresses some of the key artistic issues of Western literature.  This book is literally worth hundreds of other books which attempt to deal with the same issues, but without the profundity, insight, and expository brilliance of Auerbach.  Auerbach was one of the great literary scholars of a generation ago, surviving exemplars of which today include a short list such as Theodore Ziolkowski and Harold Bloom.  This book should be required reading for anyone embarking on the systematic study of Western literature	1996-06-17
