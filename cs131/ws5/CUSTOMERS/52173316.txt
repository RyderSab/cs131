It's sad that he is also one of the most forgotten.<br /><br />Geoffrey C. Ward has brought Johnson back to life in this compelling biography. I happen to be a boxing fan from way back but Ward has told me some things about Johnson that I didn't know. His prose is detailed and precise, with added information on the bottom of most pages. He show's Johnson as a flawed human being outside the ring but, a brillant fighter inside it.<br />Ward also writes about the times that Johnson lived in where racism was the 'norm'. Johnson struggles not only with his opponents inside the ring, but the pure hatred outside of it. It is painful at times to read.<br /><br />This is a excellent biography on a truely complex human being.<br /><br />Enjoy	2005-02-16
US	52173316	R31C49X6UDRDZA	0879109858	906926261	He Ran All the Way: The Life of John Garfield	Books	4	21	21	N	Y	Good, Solid Bio	John Garfield has been mostly forgotten by the movie going public. He has fans yes-but a place with the 'greats' of the movies seems to be just out of his reach.<br />This new biography of Garfield reminds us...what a true raw talent he was. The author tells us how Garfield burst opon the movie scene in 1938-causing such a spash that Warner Brother's were shocked and...not sure what to do with there new discovery. They plunked him in some 'B' potboilers that didn't utilize has talent but still made...money. Garfield languished for awhile and while bored still delivered some standout performances. He began to grow as an actor in the 1940's delivering what I believe to be a Oscar worthy performance in the classic BODY AND SOUL.<br />The bio does a good job of detailing the 'times' that Garfield lived in and sadly what destroyed his career. The chapters about his childhood are most fasinating.<br />The only reason I did not give this book '5 stars' is because I feel that the author took some 'pot shots' at Garfield...'shots' that he had already told us about earlier in the book.<br />Other then these 'few' comments I feel the book is a worthy and a fine way to remember,  and give our 'due' too a truely unique actor.	2004-01-06

I think I understand why some folks gave THE TRIGGERMANS DANCE a fair review.<br />It starts really SLOW..so slow that I was thinking about the next book I was going to read. The character's..at the beginning..are not very interesting..and the story plods along.<br />But..as I said..near page 100 or so..I began to care about John and the FBI agent, Joshua.<br />The story is basically about revenge and what some are willing to do to achieve it. Two men in love with the same woman join forces to bring down the guy they think is responsible for a murder and there broken hearts. Is this guy guilty or innocent?<br />When the author introduces Van Holt, a former FBI agent things really begin to take off. The tension builds and builds. Summing up..I would say..Stay with this one.<br />T.Jefferson Parker knows how to write a good thriller, this time it just took a little while to get going.	2002-07-21
US	52173316	R3MOFJ9DCD6MJE	0425163008	364671313	The Ghosts of Morning	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Fast And Furious	I wouldn't compare Richard Barre to Ross Macdonald or for that matter Raymond Chandler. Macdonald's writing was more subdued and touching, Chandler more witty and crackling, while Barre's is more 'wham bam'..'lets go'.<br />The Ghosts Of Morning is like that, fast, and twisting, it reminded me of a good action flick. Around page seventy the story really kicks into gear. I didn't find the plot confusing, Barre held it together nicely, injecting little tidbits of information to keep the reader guessing.<br />The flashbacks scenes are written very well as our hero Will Hardesty,  attempts to find some meaning from his past as well as how it connects to his future.<br />Hardesty is a part-time P.I. hired by his best friends mother to find her son, who everyone has presumed dead for years. Hardesty takes the job as a favor, not realising the depth of the secret's his former friends family has buried.<br />I agree with some of the other reviews that, some of the charecter's are sketcy and typical, BUT the story moves along so nicely that i just ignored these shortcomings.<br />A very nice read...enjoy.	2001-01-31

I had never read anything by 'Rennie Airth'..so i wasn't quite sure what to expect.<br />It was more then worth my time. The Author does a great job of keeping the reader guessing, he makes you care about the main character's, and draw's a compelling picture of the times as well as the people. He takes a different approach then most mysteries i've read ( mostly American) by writing about the 'events' and then explaining after what 'caused them'<br />His main 'Copper' John Madden is nicely drawn, a wounded haunted man, driven to detachment by pain and memories. I liked him right away, and was curious to see what had caused his pain.<br />The author parallel's the pain of Madden and the main suspect, a man accused of a atrocious murder, a secretive man, a nobody, a vicious serial killer.<br />The romantic angle is nicely covered, and feels right, contrasting with the uglyness that occurs.<br />I read somewhere that Mr. Airth is writing a NEW 'Madden' book, i can't wait to read it..	2000-11-16

WHITE WIDOW will sneak up on you.<br />'On Time' Jack Olsen is a well respected and well liked Bus driver in Texas.<br />He's a all around nice guy, with a nice house, and a even nicer wife.<br />Everything is fine until the 'White Widow' boards his bus..<br />Author Lehrer's despritions of the places and people of Texas are very effective. The story takes place in the 1950's, but there is nothing dated about WHITE WIDOW..<br />'On Time Jack' is much more complex then your average fictional character, his emortions, hidden away from his friends are troubling and very poignant.<br />Give WHITE WIDOW a try, i don't think you'll be disappointed..	2000-09-29

His style is at times  very  'Chandleresque', (he really enjoyed Chandler's books)but he brings  something else to this story that even the master Raymond Chandler wouldn't  have.<br />The word is 'dimension'. Where Chander and Hammett were known for  there 'hardboiled' approach, Macdonald's Lew Archer is obviously a man of  keen intelligence. He is also one cool customer, a flawed man in a flawed  world.<br />The story concerns a murder that could be connected to<br />another  murder that happened many years before. And, maybe another. The plot  reveals itself slowly, I wasn't quite sure where it was going, but the  writing is so crisp and poetic, that i just read, and let it all  happen.<br />This is a wonderful book, written by a man who deserves all the  praise in the world for bringing something else to the mystery novel.<br />Just read it, and enjoy.	2000-08-24

His novels are so heartfelt and deep, that even if the story is a bit familar as the above reviewers have stated, for me at least  it doesn't matter.<br />Corruption and greed are at play in Deaf Smith,  Texas. Billy Bob Holland, a one time Texas Ranger, is man with scars that  he can't hide. He's a walking wound, attempting to understand why people  act as they do, and if some of those people get into trouble, Billy Bob is  there to defend them.<br />He cant shake his violent past, a past that  includes the death of his best friend, a man and event that he can't let go  of.<br />The story center's around a murder, the accused is someone that Billy  Bob knows well, he knows the boy is innocent, but there are other's who  seem bound and determined to nail the boy and Billy Bob.<br />The pace is  fast, the dialogue is short but real, you feel as if you went to Texas you  might just run into Billy Bob.<br />This is a book to enjoy, to sit back when  the house is quiet and just read, letting yourself disappear into the world  of James Lee Burke.	2000-07-19

The hero, practicing P.I. ' Tres Navarre' is one funny guy, some of his encounters with various 'Texans' are laugh out funny. Using Texas as a  backdrop, each page comes alive as Tres moves about the state investigating  and getting into peoples hair.<br />The story Tres finds himself involved in  concerns a missing demo, a demo so important that people are prepared to  kill for it. The paces quickens as the missing demo leads to some more and  more dire situations.<br />Author Rick Riordan's dialogue crackles, Tres's  'friends' are truely memorable, and his enemies uniquely sinister.<br />Tres  is cut from the same cloth as Robert Crias 'Elvis Cole' and a long lost  relative of Chandler's 'Phillip Marlow'. He's a hero with a heart of gold,  a loner looking for something more.<br />Believe the hype this guy can  write!<br />Highly Recommended	2000-07-01

On one hand he could be  brutal and cruel, cold, and uncarring.<br />Then in the blink of eye, he's  playing with children, laughing and smiling.<br />The children respond,  unafraid of a man who scared so many others.<br />Nick Tosches captures the  essence of Liston, the many sides, moods, and moments of the former champs  life.<br />It's not a pretty picture, the mob is everywhere, filtering in and  out of Liston's life like a long dark shadow.<br />Torches research is  amazing, his writing of the Liston family is highly informative.  Going in  i already knew quite a bit about Sonny, but Tosches uncovers facts that i  had never read before.<br />This is not a book for everybody. Tosches style  is blunt and hard, like a left hook to the jaw, he wanders sometimes, but  like the man he is writing about ultimatly there is understanding.<br />If  your a boxing fan, you might be disappointed at the short shift Tosches  gives to a number of Liston's fights. It's the behind the scenes activity  he wants to tell you about, the wheeling and dealing thats so  compelling.<br />It's brutal and sad..<br />Highly Recomended	2000-06-28

Corbett. It's a 'warts and all' portrayl, telling the reader about the 'Gentlemens' dark side, and about his charming  side. His writing about the Corbett family and Jim's upbringing is very  interesting. The desriptions of Corbett's classic fights, with the likes of  'Peter Jackson, Bob Fitzsimmons, and James J. Jeffries' are told in a  entertaining and informative way. He even delves into Corbett's married  life, a part of his life that was not always pretty, but presents it in a  fair and even handed way.

Does he achieve this lofty objective?. I think he does, using mostly quotes and stories, and the unfairly ignored book by Lincolns former law partner, Mr. Walsh  walks the reader thru the history of New Salem, the ways of life back then,  and the people that remembered Ann and Abe as they were. He writes about  some historians, who for one reason or another, refuse to accept the  possiabilty that part of Abe died with Ann in 1835. The writing is crisp  and informative and very helpfull in understanding how it was to live in  the 1830's and beyond. Most of all i believe Mr. Walsh achieved something  else-thats always tricky when writing about mythical figures like Lincoln.  He made him very human....highly recomended	2000-05-03

His use of real people in history is fasinating, and by inserting his fictional 'hero' Nathan Heller, a cynical former Chicago cop, into these people's live's a sign of real writing ability. Nathan gets  involved ( in more ways then one) with Amelia Earhart. He's hired by  Amelia's husband to watch over her and to try to figure out who is sending  her threatening notes. Sounds simple enough, but as the tale unfolds, and  things begin to unravel for Nate, nothing is as simple as it first appears.

There have been so many theories, some plausiable some not so plausiable.  Mr. Walsh does a very crediable job in  returning the  reader back to Poe's time, reviewing all the witnesses  and presenting his  theory soundly. His writing at least in the beginning is a bit strange, he  uses paragraph's were normally one would see a period. I believe this is a  attempt in another way to capture the spirit of Poe, the mystery, the  macabe, the sad end. Still, Mr. Walsh deserve's credit for producing a very  quick and interesting read..	2000-01-04
