US	51299873	R1W5TXJI04PAUP	0345350596	962163505	The Star Beast	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Solid entertainment	It's more than a bit of a misnomer to call the series of novels Heinlein wrote specifically for teenagers from 1947-58 &quot;juveniles&quot;----they are actually just page-turning adventure sf with well-detailed backgrounds that just happen to have protaganists under the age of 21.  What I'm saying is that they're just as entertaining for adults as for kids, as long as the adult in question isn't looking for literary experimentation or explicit sex.  That fact is that, with one or two exceptions, Heinlein's juveniles are far more solidly entertaining than his later 'adult' novels.  (The exceptions?  Rocket Ship Galileo and Podkayne of Mars, but hey, no one ever bats .1000.)<br />The Star Beast was always one of my favorites, mainly because of Lummox.  But there's also one of Heinlein's best courtroom scenes, and plenty of other high points.  The idea of a bond between a human boy and an alien 'pet' with the alien turning out to be an important member of an advanced civilization had been touched on before, in Red Planet, but it is taken to a fascinating extreme here.  While it's true that the Stuart's seem to live in a 1950's small town, there is also a great evocation of a vast galaxy teeming with varied species and spacefaring civilizations, endless possibilities.  You can't miss with Heinlein's juveniles, but this is one of the most charming.	2001-03-02

But for some reason I cannot fathom I bought Red Planet but just didn't get around to reading it.  Not until my late '20's, when a friend who was a recent convert to the series strongly recommended it, did I finally read Red Planet, and it confirmed a long-held belief: That an adult can get just as much entertainment from these books as a kid.  It's fun to note the Heinlein stand-in character, Doc MacRae, who is basically a mouthpiece for the author's opinions, but an amusing one.  And what a delight that the Martians are the same as the ones in Stranger In A Strange Land, water ceremonies and all, but without the claptrap of the later book.  Another major delight of the novel is Willis, perhaps the first example in Heinlein's work of a boy's alien &quot;pet&quot; that would turn out to be much more (Heinlein would expand on this notion with The Star Beast).   Finally, when my son demanded I read him Red Planet recently, and after being cautioned that it had no pictures he greatly enjoyed it, this became one of my all-time favorite Heinlein juveniles.  By the way, this new edition has a couple of extra paragraphs at the end; the slight extra doesn't really affect the story though.	2001-02-27

This has got to be the best all-round Virginia Lee Burton book, which means it's one of the best children's books of all time.  The simple prose reaches a level of lyricism not found in Mike Mulligan, and the illustrations have a folksy charm and energy that's just right.  Reading it as an adult, one thinks of all the little houses that were NOT saved, and of the ongoing suburban sprawl that's even now despoiling the landscape, but the fact that the eponymous little house is moved and cared for once again by the end makes it a good story for little kids.  Other books by Burton tend to wear me down with repetition, but this one remains fresh with almost every rereading that my kids demand.	2001-01-10

This is one of my two or three favorite Bill Peet books, and ranks high on the list of books that I WISH had been read to me as a child.  It's also the only Peet book that has a science fiction element, as far as I know.  In case you haven't read it, I won't spoil it except to say that it's similar Dr. Seuss's The Lorax except less of a chore to read aloud.  Strong pro-ecology, anti-pollution message, charming artwork.  Great for kids under six, but I never tire of it either.	2000-12-22

Only Kevin Brownlow's The Parade's Gone By even comes close.  There are chapters on the mechanics and aesthetics of silent film that should be read by everyone with an interest in the form.  In addition, his chains of reasoning and perceptions are put forth with an aptness and lucidity that conceals the depth of the intellectual analysis.  The elegantly straightforward prose makes this book a joy to read from start to finish.  Further, in addition to covering the film work of the &quot;big four&quot; (Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, and Langdon) Kerr also sheds welcome light on lesser-known and even forgotten figures, such as the &quot;unexpected&quot; Raymond Giffith.  Finally, this is a book that was well-produced on every level, right down to the layout, chapter headings, and fonts.  Numerous film stills of every size (inluding some generous two-page spreads) make it a feast for the eyes as well as the mind, cogently and often playfully setting off the text.  The original hardback edition published by Knopf was meant as a sort of intelligent coffee-table book (most assuredly NOT an oxymoron in this case), and the present oversized-paperback edition provided by the good folks at Da Capo should be seen in the same light.  Both a celebration of silent comedy and a superb investigation of the form.  Also a book that you can dip into again and again over the years with undiminished pleasure and come away with reinvigorated enthusiasm for the subject.  If you don't have it, get it.	2000-12-22

But as John Bengston reminds us in this invaluable book, Keaton's shorts and features were filmed in very real physical locations that still exist, and by searching them out provides not only a window on the past but a barometer of seven or eight decades of change.  What Bengston has done here really requires a new name, as it combines the realms of photographer, 'urban archeologist,' archivist, geographer, and of course historian.  His eye for architectural detail is acute, enabling him to pinpoint the location of a particular scene by triangulating (so to speak) between various photos and film shots, using one or two surviving details as reference points.  The meticulous research that went into the book is daunting to contemplate, all to give the humble Keaton enthusiast a few hours of joy.  Obviously, the book will fascinate fans of old Los Angeles as well, but I was particularly interested in the locations that went further afield.  The General, for instance, was filmed all the way up in Cottage Grove, Oregon, in the greater Eugene area, while Steamboat Bill, Jr. was filmed in Sacramento, once a popular remote location during the silent era.  Nabokov said that God is in the details and that is the reason for any and every Keaton fan to dive headlong into this unique, delightful, detail-obsessed book.  Even the august Kevin Brownlow gives Bengston a tip of the hat, admitting in his forward that after scouting locations for his Keaton documentary---&quot;despite all the resources of Thames Television and eager researchers, we did not find out nearly as much as Bengston did on his own.&quot;  Could there be a better tribute?	2000-12-20

In 1979, Gutman took the plunge with the simply titled &quot;American Diner&quot; published in hardback by Harper &amp; Row.  Done in collaboration with Elliott Kaufman and David Slovic, it was shorter and more loosely organized than the later edition, but a nice and welcome diner book at a time when there still weren't many such books around.  In 1993 Gutman came out with &quot;American Diner, Then and Now&quot; which sported revised and substantially enlarged text and better-integrated photos (the Kaufman photo portfolios had also been dropped).  This revamped '93 version was a high-water mark for diner books, a now numerous field.  With it's perfect balance between individual diner stories (&quot;dinerlore&quot;), photos, and history, and great attention to detail which bespeaks a real love of the subject, this has been an unofficial bible for diner afficionados for the last 7 years.  <br />Now here is the 2000 edition, published in paperback by Johns Hopkins (apparently Barry Levinson's hometown has more interest in diners than the folks at Harper).  This is basically just a reprint of the 1993 edition, with a different cover, a new introduction, and a few names added to the diner index at the end.  While on the one hand it's great that this modern classic is available again (it had been out of print for several years) I had hoped that there would be some new material in it.  To be sure, this book still teaches you how to tell a Paramount from a Mountain View, or a Fodero from a Worcester Lunch Car, and makes a fine gift (Christmas or otherwise) for someone who doesn't have the '93 edition.  Nevertheless, at the risk of sounding like an ingrate, I would have to say I slightly prefer the '93 edition, mainly because the cover photo, an interior shot of a restored Worcester Lunch Car, with all that luscious wood, is more attractive than the rather bland shot of Ford's Diner that graces the cover of the 2000 edition.But make no mistake, if you don't have any diner books and are looking for a good one, this is THE one to get----and if you've already got five other diner books, you should still get this, as it has the clearest explication of American diner history you're ever likely to read.	2000-12-10

This collection reminds us that photography can be not only a harrowing journalistic document, or some supreme aesthetic achievement, but can also be just plain fun.  Erwitt seems like the kind of guy who always carries a camera wherever he goes and snaps uncounted numbers of pictures to get a few witty gems.   This is THE Erwitt collection, and the lengthy introduction gives some biographical context to the photos.  Of course, knowing something of the personal context of a photographer's work isn't absolutely necessary (the photos speak for themselves if they are any good) but these are styled &quot;PERSONAL Exposures&quot; after all, so it makes sense to know a little about the man.  This is a big, generous book, and the photos were obviously selected and ordered with care.  An excellent overview of an interesting career.	2000-11-02

You'll notice details here that you missed in the Dover reprint &quot;New York in the Thirties&quot; and there are many more photos here as well, quite a few seeing publication for the first time.  There's loads of ancillary information too, including maps that indicate exactly where in New York each photo was taken.  This book is a treasurehouse.	2000-11-02

Much of what we thought we knew has turned out to be wrong, and much of what we HAVE learned was discovered astonishingly recently---within the last generation in many cases.  Also, Kunzig never lets you forget that the fascinating information we've gathered about undersea currents, say, or biological diversity at great depths, even ocean floor topology, is still sketchy and provisional.  Rather than depressing, this is an exciting prospect, an adventure that is still in the early stages (and likely to remain so for some time, since undersea research gets hardly any funding).  The only truly depressing part of the book, for me, is the account in chapter eight of the collapse (through overfishing) of the cod population off the coasts of New England and Newfoundland.  In any case, Kunzig has the McPhee talent for highlighting the personalities of the scientists involved, but never loses sight of the underlying scientific issues.  Also, I like how he begins, appropriately, with the water molecule and how the Earth got all it's water in the first place, then ends the book with how the planet may evenually lose it's water, billions of years hence.  Nice symmetry there.	2000-10-20

This is that rarest of birds, a celebrity biography that's actually a good book.  Thomson is an insightful, elegant writer and a solid film (and film industry) critic, and his skills are fully at work here, as he resists both of the the strong responses that Welles usually elicits: hero worship, and the urge to debunk.  Obviously long fascinated by Welles, Thomson manages to be as objective as possible (though I think he errs on the side of generosity with regard to some of Welles's post-Kane films).   Thomson even manages to say something original and interesting about Citizen Kane, which alone would make the book worth a read.  The real trouble with a biography of Welles is how to deal with the last two thirds of the life of someone who reached his peak at 26.  That's a lot of anticlimax to deal with.  Peter Guralnik faced a similar problem in his massive, two-volume Elvis Presley biography---how to write meaningfully and accurately about post-Army Elvis without boring people to death.  Thomson deals rather more successfully with post-Kane Welles, mainly because he doesn't go into as much detail.  Admittedly the later parts of the book become a bit of a blur; but throughout the book one gets the strong sense that Thomson has a firm grasp (as much as anyone can) of the enigmatic Welles---has his number, so to speak.  Yet he is neither cruel nor fawning.  This is THE Welles bio to read.	2000-10-19

Wodehouse's golf stories are among his best, perhaps because, as a golfer himself, he understood the absurd passion one can have for the game.  This is the best of his golf story collections because every one of the stories uses the framing device of being told by the Oldest Member.

It's not that this is a perfect selection of stories (what anthology can boast that?)----rather, it gives a real sense of what it must have been like to be an sf fan back in the late thirties, and grow up reading Astounding, the leading magazine in the field for quite a while.  (I realize that nostalgia for  a time before I was born could be considered a form of sickness, but let's leave that alone right now.)  It starts when John W. Campbell, jr. assumed the editorship, and follows the development of the magazine through the war and up into the early sixties, when Campbell changed its name to Analog.  The stories are presented chronologically, 1937-46 in volume one, and 1947-65 in volume two.  The intoductory notes steep you in the feel of those days.  And aside from the historical and fan/anthropology aspects this is just a damn good anthology.  Sure, we've got &quot;Nightfall,&quot; &quot;City,&quot; &quot;First Contact,&quot; &quot;The Little Black Bag,&quot; &quot;The Cold Equations,&quot; and &quot;Call Me Joe&quot; which have all been anthologized ad infinitum, but there are some rarer gems here as well.  &quot;Farewell To the Master&quot; by Harry Bates, which was the basis of the movie The Day the Earth Stood Still.  &quot;By His Bootstraps&quot; the wickedly clever time-paradox story by Heinlein (under the MacDonald pen name) which is perhaps so hard to find because it doesn't happen to fall within his Future History series.  Theodore L. Thomas's masterful &quot;The Weather Man,&quot; perhaps the quintessential early-sixties Analog story.  I wish that they'd chosen &quot;Basic Right&quot; by Eric Frank Russell rather than &quot;The Waitabits&quot; but you can't have everything.  This should be in every science fiction reader's library, whether or not they consider themselves an Astounding/Analog reader.	2000-10-05

You could think of this as a coffee-table version of the McAlester's Field  Guide to American Houses (which I also recommend.)  In this case each house  is an historical landmark as well as an exemplar of an architectural style,  and the photos are suitably sumptuous.  I like coffee-table books that also  give you solid information as well as pretty pictures, and this one  succeeds admirably on both counts.  It may not have every artist's or  magnate's house you can think of, but it has a lot of them.  A modern  classic.	2000-09-19

I'm a particular fan  of Timothy Ferris because he always seems to be reasoning toward a goal  along with you, rather than kicking you in the butt to get there, or, even  worse, running on ahead of you.  My one caveat is not so much a criticism  as an observation: any book like this that attempts to give a  'state-of-the-universe(s)report&quot; will inevitably be out of date before  the ink is dry, and so it is with this.  New discoveries, new data, and new  theories to cover them are constantly coming down the pike, and one wishes  he could update the book every six months, though that's hardly  practical.<br />The most welcome and rewarding part of the book, for me, was  the late chapter on 'Quantum Weirdness.'  So many writers have taken a stab  at this subject and usually trot out the same tired cliched metaphors and  analogies.  Here Ferris explicates the subject with clarity, freshness, and  depth.  Quite the best 'quantum for the layman' writing I've read in many a  moon.  In fact, the book gets more interesting as it goes along.<br />In  short, this is not the grand historical summation that Coming of Age In the  Milky Way was, but is a good overview of where we are now in cosmology.   Now, if someone could just put out a collection of his articles.	2000-09-17

Seriously, the Merriam-Webster Third Edition created a huge  controversy when it was first released in 1961, being the first major U.S.  dicitonary that took a mainly DESRIPTIVE rather than PRESCIPTIVE approach  to the english language.  Never mind that European dicionaries had been  doing much the same for a hundred years or more, to many Americans this was  heresy.  The ripples from this storm are still bouncing about today.  Too  bad that Philip Gove, the editor and virtual godfather of the Third, was  such a poor defender of it.  Also too bad he didn't live long enough to see  his editorial philosophy largely vindicated.  Morton gives equal attention  to Philip Gove, the dictionary itself, and the G. &amp; C. Merriam Company.   The historical section on Noah Webster and his dictionary, how it was  acquired by the Merriam brothers, and the subsequent history of the company  is most informative and fascinating.  So is the discussion at the end of  the lasting effects of Webster's Third.  As it should be with any book  about dictionaries, the material is well-organized, with everything clearly  and logically laid out.  A good read, and a must for lexiphiles.	2000-09-03

Some books are all photos, some are all stories  of individual diners and their owners.  Gutman gives a clear, interesting  account of the gestation and development of this peculiarly American form  of restaurant (like most good things, it came from the Northeast), traces  the fortunes of the original diner manufacturing companies, details the  tangled stories of newer companies that branched off, tells how the diner  changed with the times, and finally leads us to the recent era of  retro-diners.  But he doesn't stint on photos, both exterior and interior,  of gleaming old classic diners, and there are sidebars telling about  individual diners.   If you want to be able to tell a Fodero from a  Worcester Lunch Car, or a Paramount from a Mountain Veiw, this is your  book.  If you just want to gawk at diner pictures, this is also your book.   The diner index at the back is great fun, too, even though it was bound to  be out of date before the book hit the stores in 1993.  (Even more fun to  find diners that he missed; there are at least two such in Massachusetts.)   Too bad this is now out of print, but apparently a new edition is slated to  be published later this year.	2000-08-31

This  novel was polished to perfection because he used the time he spent in  internment during World War II to work on it, thus giving it more time than  probably any of his other books.  In England it was called Joy In the  Morning, but by any name they don't come much funnier.	2000-08-25

It's the  perfect introduction to Wodehouse's farcical world.  The thing that makes  this series stand out from the Blandings series and everything else is that  they're told by clueless, intellectually-challanged Bertie Wooster, and  this adds a delicious extra layer of humor.  This is also why any  performance of the Jeeves novels will necessarily only catch a fraction of  the wit to be found in the books.  You get the situations but not the  narration.  Jeeves In the Morning was titled Joy In the Morning in Britain,  by the way.  Fair warning: read either Code of the Woosters or Jeeves In  the Morning and you risk becoming a Wodehouse fan for life.  (Of course, I  think it's a risk you should take.)	2000-08-20

When I was first getting seriously into jazz, this book (along with Martin  Williams's The Jazz Tradition) was the principal critical aid.  Since then  I've reread it for pleasure countless times, for it's not only critically  perspicacious but also has considerable literary merit.  Da Capo is  righting a longstanding wrong by putting this book back into print, as the  original Oxford University Press edition has been unavailable for  some  time.  Not only new converts, but old sweats who happened to miss it the  first time around should read this book, or just anyone who likes  well-written prose.  One of the nice things about reprints is the chance  for an author to put in a contemporary word, and it's very nice to see that  this book has a new preface by Giddins, written almost 20 years after the  introduction to the first edition.  He comments with bemusement on the  younger writer represented in these pages, and gives valuble information on  the publishing history of Riding On A Blue Note, as well as updating the  Red Rodney piece somewhat.<br />Though this is a book primarily about jazz, it  lives up to it's subtitle (Jazz and American Pop) by including chapters on  Bing Crosby, Otis Blackwell, Bobby Blue Bland, the Dominoes, and Frank  Sinatra, though Giddins gives fair warning in the old intro that they are  studied from the viewpoint of a jazz critic.  In fact, the chapter entitled  &quot;Just How Much Did Elvis Learn from Otis Blackwell?&quot; is one of  the most fascinating in the book as it attempts to uncover some of the  tangled, subterranean back-and-forth influences between black and white  music.  The chapter on Red Rodney (&quot;Adventures of the Red Arrow&quot;)  is funny as hell and functions as an entertaining short story even if it is  someday proved to be a Rodney-perpetrated hoax.  I'm tempted to say that  Giddins is particularly sound on Ellington, Count Basie, and Dexter Gordon,  but then I would have to add that he also does well by trombonist Jack  Teagarden, Irving Berlin, Ornette Coleman, Sonny Rollins, Dizzy Gillespie,  and Charlie Parker... Though I hate to sound like a jacket blurb, the fact  is that this truly is one of those rare collections in which every essay is  a gem, both informative on first reading and a delight to reread.  The only  drawback is that Da Capo charges top dollar for their paperback reprints,  but it's worth it.   Giddins has written several other fine books over the  years but there's something special about this one.	2000-08-20

Muller sucessfully walks a tightrope here between the overly  academic, theory-mongering, insufferably highbrow type of book, and the  shallow, campy, or nostalgia-drenched types at the other end of the  spectrum, and he barely stumbles.  Though he steadfastly refuses to take  himself too seriously, his underlying devotion to the genre is evident  throughout.  Along with plenty of behind-the-scenes gossip he doesn't fail  to provide solid descriptions and opinions of the movies in question, from  such classics as The Maltese Falcon and Kiss of Death to semi-obscure gems  like T-Men.  As a film critic he has a &quot;feet-on-the-ground&quot;  integrity and hits the bull's eye on most of the films he mentions (meaning  I usually agree with him).  He's particularly good on the caper-film  subgenre.   Asphalt Jungle, Crime Wave, and Kubrick's The Killing all get  their rightful due, as does the career of Sterling Hayden.   Indeed, one of  the delights of Dark City is the engrossing profiles of various actors and  actresses who made their mark on the genre, including Barbara Stanwyck,  Richard Widmark, John Garfield, and the redoubtable Robert Ryan.  Muller  has a sharp eye for character actors as well.<br />The structure of the book  is tongue-in-cheek; equating the entire nebulous noir genre with a  metaphorical city (the 'dark city' of the title), he breaks down the  various themes and subgenres into chapters with place-name titles, such as  &quot;Shamus Flats&quot; for the detective movie, &quot;Knockover  Square&quot; for the caper film, and so on.   If this sounds  groan-inducing, don't worry.   He handles it well and turns it into great  fun, mainly because there's substance in each chapter as well as kidding  around.  Muller in fact provides a valuable service in tracing the literary  roots of much film noir to pre-war pulp fiction such as the 20's magazine  Black Mask, and his profile of Cornell Woolrich is most welcome.   Woolrich  was a fount of paranoid pulp stories, and more of his tales were adapted to  the big screen than anyone else's, yet he is far lesser known than Dashiell  Hammett and Raymond Chandler, who are also discussed.  Also, there are  enough sumptuous black and white stills here to make the book a joy just to  flip through.   Too many film books don't have enough photos, but that's  not a problem here, and the text gives full recognition of the essential  role that cinematographers played in the impact of the movies.   Film noir  was very much a cinematographer's genre, after all, even if they didn't  have much of a budget.<br />There's always some favorite that's left out of  even the finest film book, and I looked in vain for a mention of Alexander  Mackendrick's caustic The Sweet Smell of Success, perhaps the last great  noir, but this is a minor quibble.   Any book that deals so well with films  such as Force of Evil, Out of the Past, and scores of others is allowed one  or two oversights.   If you're a longtime fan of film noir or a new  convert, Eddie Muller's Dark City is well worth your time.	2000-08-18

He's taken a daunting, complex subject and done it justice in one  (admittedly hefty) volume, without slighting that complexity or loosing the  thread of his narrative.  Books about the Civil War can easily become  either a military buff's recitation of battles and marches, or a dull  delving into sociopolitical causes and results that loses sight of the  IMPORTANCE of battles.  McPherson is careful to avoid these pitfalls.  In  readable, clear prose the first third of the book gives a fascinationg  account of the social, political, and economic climate leading up to the  war.  He even writes about technology, architecture, transportation.  After  getting this 'lay of the land' the reader is ready to put the conflict on a  solid grounding of context.  Without it, any account of the war would risk  becoming a meaningless hash of dates, names, and blood.  The following  account of the war itself keeps a careful eye on political and social  events in the two capitols as well as events on the battlefield, and how  the two affected each other.   Of particular interest is the continuing  story of the Confederacy's diplomatic attempts to gain recognition as a  nation, perhaps as a prelude to actual military involvement by a European  power such as England or France.  This was a real possibility during the  first part of the war, and naturally the last thing the Union wanted.  But  this is just one thread among many that he deftly weaves through the  narrative.  A masterful, engrossing book. <br />Southerners who object to this  book are, I think, really reacting to its lack of Gone With the Wind-type  moonshine.  This is an objective work of history, and that always ruffles  some feathers.<br />One of the best history books I've ever read.  One wishes  McPherson had been contracted to write the next volume in the Oxford  History of theUnited States, for when you get to page 862, you are left  wanting more.	2000-08-17

Then read  Ship of the Line, then Flying Colors.  The three are practically a  triptych, whereas the others all feel like they have space between them.   Also, since Forester actually wrote Beat To Quarters first, there's in  'introductory' quality to it that no other book in the series has.  The  series compares favorably with the Aubrey/Maturin series I think.  Odd that  they were both cut short by the deaths of their respective authors.<br />In  short, start with this and the next two as a trilogy, then proceed in any  order you want.	2000-08-04

Space Viking has the sheer readability and forward momentum of good pulp science fiction but with an extra historical dimension lacking in most pulp.  Or to put it  another way, this could be the best Heinlein-style novel not written by  Heinlein.  Also could well have been an influence on Star Wars, but don't  let that put you off.  Set in the same (&quot;Terro-Human&quot;) future  history as Piper's Fuzzy novels, but after the breakup of the Federation.   The stand-alone quality of Space Viking, plus the action and economy, put  it a notch higher in my affection than the Fuzzy series.  This was probably  his best sf novel and should by rights be put back into print.	2000-07-11
