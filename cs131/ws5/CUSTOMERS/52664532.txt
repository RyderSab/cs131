(And this is from a mother who has read zillions!) Concise and clear, it is filled with practicle, doeable advice. While addressed mainly to parents of young children, I found that much of its content could be used just as well for older children.	2001-06-17
US	52664532	R2OXN5GNE306KG	1570620679	872385426	The Parents' Guide to Alternatives in Education	Books	5	5	5	N	N	AN ABSOLUTE MUST-READ	If you have children and you care about the kind of education they receive, you absolutely MUST read this book - ideally before they ever start school. In a single volume it will give you a background into what traditional public education is all about, explain why it may not be your best choice, and introduce you to almost two dozen other options. Educational alternatives described in this book range from the well-known (Montessori, Waldorf, homeschooling...) to those you may have never heard of, such as Reggio Emilia, Carden, and Foxfire.  It also includes descriptions of schooling options in half a dozen different religious denomimations. Every parent owes it to his/her children to read this book before the child begins school.	2001-04-27

What I found, instead, is a book dealing specifically with the issue of how homeschooling families can live frugally.  It's probably a good book if that's what you're looking for, but the title did not give me any clue that this is what it's about.	2001-04-10

It's a good read - particularly the harrowing story about how Nancy's ex-husband abducted her children and took them across the world to Australia. But it is NOT a guidebook. I also was bothered by the fact that Karen handled her parenting in what I thought was a very selfish way. If I recall correctly, she moved him away from his father after the divorce, and then each time the child settled in to a town, with hobbies and relationships, she decided - for no compelling reason - to move someplace else.	2001-02-09

The reason? It portrays Esther as a real person that girls can truly identify with, while not straying from the honest Torah understanding of the holiday. Additionally, the combination of realistic text (presented in the form of Esther's diary) and stunning illustrations make this book a literary treat.  I wish this author-illustrator team would get together to create stories about all the Biblical heroines!	2001-01-17

It is a simple-to-read yet absolutely comprehensive guide to conversion. I didn't see a word of propaganda in it. The book makes no claim to be anything other than a presentation of  conversion to authentic Judaism.  Those who want to fake a conversion with  a Reform or Conservative rabbi are free to do so, but it's not fair to  expect this book to condone their charade.	2000-07-16

My only complaint about that it uses archaic (or regional?) language that in many cases even I (the parent!) didn't  understand.  It didn't really keep us from enjoying the story; it was just  frustrating for me to be flustered by words in a children's book!  I would  recommend it nonetheless; just be sure to read it to your kids rather than  handing it to them to read themselves, as it may frustrate a young reader.	2000-04-04

As an adult with ADD (which I found out by reading Driven to Distraction), I can honestly say that this book changed my life.  It altered my entire self-perception.  <br />Now, instead of seeing myself as a lazy, disorganized,  half-crazy person, I understand that I have a common condition with  negative - and positive - traits. I also understand clearly why I failed so  miserably in school and no longer blame myself for it.  Even just the  knowledge that there are other people with the same syndrome, the same  behaviors... is comforting! <br />The altered self-concept has made me a much  more positive person, and knowing what I'm dealing with has helped me to  nurture the positive aspects of my ADD, particularly the ability to  hyperfocus on tasks that are important to me.	2000-01-02
