The book is readable and well organized. The subdivisions of chapters along with their titles  facilitate the readers understanding of the topics.  At first glance a work of over 500 pages looks extremely challenging however, I actually got to points where I could not put the book down.<br /><br />If there is one thesis that runs through the book I would say it is found in the final conclusion.  It is that we fail to understand the legacy spawned by the disemberment of the Ottoman Empire early in the 20th century.  \\"The end of the Ottoman order created new Arab states separated by new borders drawn by British and French officials to serve European imperial interest.\\" Coupled with the desire of Eurpe and America to maintain its supply of oil and the creation of the State of Isreal, there exist a formula for disorder and confusion that will probably never be settled.<br /><br />Cleveland fairly gives both sides of the extremely controversial picture that pits two religions - Islam and Judism - against each other.  He shows how both religions are also greater than the concept of religion held by most Americans.  In both cases, religion is also a part of the government and law.<br /><br />There are not answers in the book, but for the thinking person who wants to understand the Middle East, Cleveland goes a long way in terms of helping each person come to their own conclusions.	2005-10-01

Rockefeller	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A Great Book and a Great Reader	I purchased TITAN when if first came out, but never got around to reading it. When I spyed the title of audio cassette I was at first reluctant to tackle a book with 13 tapes in just the first part. However, it was an excellent decision.<br /><br />The narrator, Edward Holland does an outstanding job.  He makes the story come alive.<br /><br />The book reveals a side of Rockefeller that I was totally unaware of.  We all know he was a philathropist but did you know that his money cured hook worm disease in the American South and most of Central America?  I was totally unaware of his contributions to the University of Chicago and that his giving virtually started research institutes in America.<br /><br />Of course there is a down side to Rockefeller and his trust and Standard Oil, but the amount of giving that Rockefeller gave in his life and through his contributions to the arts, science, medicine and social issue is so fast it can hardly be measured.	2005-09-25

If you are just interested in the Sistine Chapel I would also strongly recommend this book. But the book is much more than a history of how Michelangelo painted the ceiling.  It is a history of Papacy and part of Italy during the 14th and 15th century.<br /><br />Although there are some drawing and prints of various works by Michelangelo and others in the book, I was fortunate enough to have another book, essentially a picture book of the Sistine Chapel that I used as a compliment to this work.  That proved very helpful.  There were also pictures that I was able to bring up on the internet.<br /><br />When I went to the Sistine Chapel I commented that there is probably a art history dissertation on every figure in the fresco.  I didn't know how true that was.  The stories behind each figure are fascinating.	2005-08-30

Davis did not go to trial but raised as a defense to the charges of treason Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. The provision provides that those who had been an elected official in the Confederacy could not  hold public office except for those who had been pardoned by a 2/3 vote of each both houses of Congress to remove the disability.  Davis' defense asserted that the imposition of this prohibitian from holding office was a penalty and any further penalty imposed against him would be a violation of his 5th Amendment rights which bar double jeopardy.  William Davis incorrectly states that \\"any futher trial would be a violation of the ex post factro statute.\\"  Ex post facto would be punishment for a law that did not exist at the time of the act.	2005-07-28

Schiesinger's A LIFE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY is a trip down memory lane.  When I got the recorded version out of the library and realized it was 20 tapes, I figured that I would never finish it, barring a drive across country. However, the melodious voice of Nelson Runger, with whom I have traveled many miles with other recorded books, makes Schiesinger's story not only interesting but memorable.<br /><br />The book relates much of Schiesinger's life and the hundreds of people that he had close contact with. Many of the people that he mentions are familiar.  His war time experiences brought back memories of stories from my parents.  There are hundreds of bits of Americana along with Scheisinger's insights into many famous incidents of the 20th century.<br /><br />There are early glimpses of people who went on to be major figures in American politics and history.<br /><br />I certainly don't know that I could have read all 680 plus pages of this work, but the 20 tapes passed very quickly and I really enjoyed it.	2005-07-23

The basic premise is that after the rise of democracy after the first World War, Europe accepted totalitarian governments as a solution to economic and social problems.  The author shows the roots of anti semintism in Germany and how Hitler  came to power with the consent of the governed.  One of his major points of emphasis is the failure of the liberals to achieve success. There  are many excellent points in this book that shed light on contemporary Europe.	2005-07-09

Although it was a New York Times Bestseller at some point, I must have missed it.  Since I visited Barcelona years ago and also am a lover of books I had great anticipation about this novel.  For the most part, the book was equal to my anticipation.<br /><br />At the center of the story is the young Daniel, the son of a Barcelona  book dealer and his serach for Julian Carax and his novels.  The first subplot introduces the reader to the blind Clara and her household, which Daniel quickly becomes a part of.  But this is the first of many subplots, perhaps too many.  Daniel's life becomes absorbed with the search for Julian and the reader becomes absorbed in the many subplots that reveal the tortured life of Julian Carax and the people who surround his life.<br /><br />It seemed to me that somewhere along the line the author forgot about Clara and at the end tells the reader what happens to her. Daniel's chance meeting with a homeless man and their ultimate friendship was pretty predictable. The author takes the reader through a labyrinth of characters that weave their way through the streets of Barcelona, some of which got almost too confusing.<br /><br />Somewhere around page 300 or so I kept getting the feeling \\"enough is enough.\\" I wondered how he was going to pull it all together at the end. Through many interlocking relationships, Ruiz Zafron brings the book to a close, but I felt that some of the endings were a little contrived.  But once you introduce a character you have to create an ending for them.  However, all in all I enjoyed the book.  For those who have been to Barcelona, there are many references to streets and locations.<br /><br />All in all, it's worth the read.	2005-06-29

The narrator voice brings the emotions of the battle field to life.

Vowell, who manages to drag along a sister, her infant newphew or miscellaneous friends on her investigatory journeys vists the sites of these tragic events and the sites of a number of  out of the way museums and repositories that hold some uique and macabre pieces of Americana.  The friends and relatiaves are included because Vowell is single and doesn't drive so they become her chauffers and companions and add a bit of comic relief.  While there is a great deal of valuable information about the locations of the memorabilia - like pieces of bones and brains - Vowell manages to insert her political opinons about the current administration, its foreign policy and the war in Iraq.  Vowell clearly wears her politcis on her sleeves.<br /><br />As someone who shares Vowell's interest in presidential assassinations, I found most of the book interesting as it refreshed my recollection of many items and supplied new informaiton on others. However, there were times that Vowell added superfluous information about other subjects that were tangential to her subject.<br /><br />She makes a number of historial errors regarding facts that I am familiar with which makes me question all of her information. She appears most informed on the Lincoln assassination. Some of the mistakes that I found are as follows:  Rutherford B. Hayes was not dumbed in a reelection bid in 1880, as Vowell states. He announced after his \\"election\\" in the disputed election of 1876 that he would not run again.<br /><br />Garfield had been elected to the Senate from Ohio when he was elected President in 1880 making him one of the few members of the senate elected to the white house - other include Harding and Kennedy. Vowell refers to him as a member of the House.  Vowell mistakingly states that Garfield graduated from Hiram College, which was in fact called the Eclectic Insitutute at the time. He later became President of the Eclectic.  Garfield graduated from Williams college.  However, Vowell does get it right later in the book, which gives rise to whether or not the editors did a good job on the book.<br /><br />As a resident of Cleveland Ohio and a frequent visitor to the Garfield Momument, I don't know where the chapel is that Vowell refers to as being a part of the Garfield momument.  Maybe she was thinking of the Wade Cahpel, located in the same cemetery but not a part of the Garfield momument.  Actually, I got the feeling that by the time Vowell visited Garfield's tomb in Cleveland and McKinley's tomb in Canton, that she was doing a rush to judgement and skipping opportunities for meaningful research and rushing to finish the book.<br /><br />She certainly does not think much of Chester A. Arthur, nor Garfield or McKinley. Apparently she was not aware of the fact that Arthur was second choice for Vice President.  The first guy turned it down.  Seems to me that would have adeed a nice twist to her references to a man who gave up the best patronage job in the country - Port Director for the City Of New York - for wat seemed like a dead i job at the time.  The fact that Garfield was embalmed so badly that corpse turned green and smelled so bad that people got sick during the visitation at the Capital would have made interesting reading since she is being macabre, but she left out that tid bit.<br /><br />The major part of the book is devoted to the Lincoln Assassination.  Robert Todd Lincoln's proximity to his father's, Garfield's and McKinlley's death is a thread that could have been woven a little tighter.  In fact, many parts of the book could have been woven  a little tighter.  Arguable this is a tongue in cheek approach, but in many respects th author sort of wanders through her subject with a semi shot gun approach sometimes spending too much time on current politics.<br /><br />All of this beingsaid, Vowell does give an interesting view of a deadly subject - no pun intended. Her travels reflect the experiences of most people who have visited historic sites and she is a wealth of information about plaes to see for those interested in the subject It's anovel subject and a clever idea for a book.  In another 50 years I guess someone will write a book about similar museums relating to the deaths of  JFK, RFK and MLK. By then everyone with a living memory of the events will be dead.  That's the only way that you can deal with the subject of death in a humorous manner.  Vowell is indeed an iconoclast but in a strange witty way, it works.>All of this being said, Vowell does give an interesting view of a deadly subject - no pun intended.

I subsequently found out that it is widely used in highschools, colleges and universitites.  I have to admit that ordering the Cliff Notes along with the book was a wise decision and you can note from my many other reviews on Amazon that I am a sophisticated reader.  THINGS FALL APART is not always easy to follow.  Reading the Cliff Notes along with the book helped me with some of the underlying meanings and also verified that I had to correct understanding of some of the situations.<br /><br />I believe that if there is one major theme in the book, its the clash of cultures. We as westerners always identify with the westerners who make first contact with people of other cultures.  As a result it hard to identify with other cultures. THINGS FALL APART gives you that chance to understand other religions and how other people life.  But it also gives you the opportunity to think about basic concepts of right and wrong.  While the book takes place in Africa, the situations can be compared to other religions and other clashes of culture.<br /><br />At first glance we think it absurd for the tribe to blindly follow the word of the oracles.  But then think of situations in other religions and other times when people blindly followed the directions of a dictator or religious leaders.  The bottom line is that there is much room for discussion in this book.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that a few students wrote reviews of this book panning it.  Apparently they did only did a superficial reading of the book.  Or possibly did not get a good background lecture from their teachers.<br /><br />This would be a great book for discussion in a book club.  It is for the serious reader.  It makes the reader reflect on his or her own life and culture and wonder what decisions you would make if faced with the same situation.  Are there basic concepts of right and wrong that go beyond the demands of culture? Did Okonkwo's failure come about as a result of his going against those basic conflicts?  Read the book and make up your own mind.<br /><br />Although this is a book about early contact between Europeans and primitive African peoples it is not about first contact.  You will note that Okonkwo, has a gun which he obviously got from a European.  That gun contributes significantly to his down fall.  A good topic for discussion is the influence of guns in the story.'s failure come about as a result of his going against those basic conflicts?

I decided that due to its length I'd buy it when I got home or get it from the library. However, as I was leaving the country I had a couple of hundred rand, so I decided to spend it on this book.  Frankly, it was one of those books that you buy and I figured that I would never get through it. However, on the 12 hour flight from Cape Town to London I became enthralled with Mandela and his life.<br /><br />The book is well worth the read and moves along very quickly.  Having visited Robin Island and experienced South Africa, reading the book was extremely meaningful.  The feelings of reconcilation that are prevelant at least with the people I spoke with have their roots in Mandela's philosophy.<br /><br />I always thought that Mandela was a great man, but reading this book put his stock up a lot higher.<br /><br />He is truly a national treasure of the world.	2005-05-28

However, they appear only in passing in EVENTIDE.  There seems to be a parallel between them and Harold and Raymond McPherson.  Will the young boys grow into the old men that we come to know so well in the stories?<br /><br />Eventide is a good name for the work. It aptly sums up the people and the town of Holt - its even.  Live goes on, in spite of tragedy.<br /><br />There are many tragic figures in the book; children left without parents, both physically and emotionally and people who throw thier lives away.  There are people who cause pain and people who try to sow love.  But life is not easy for any of the characters in the book.  Some survive easier than others. Some realize that you have to move on.<br /><br />But there is also hope.  One believes that Victoria will succeed and although we don't know for sure, I believe that DJ will be a success. Raymond survives and finds friendship and love, even after a rough start.  Because he has Tom Guthrie and Maggie Jones, one is sure that he will be taken care of.<br /><br />The book shows that there are good people that want to hlep and people that seem to have little hope.  Some are able to overcome the emotional scars of thier youth and some are not.  Some merely cover them up and let them fester and some actually allow those scars to heal.  Life goes on as the title suggests and it seems that some of the characters are trapped, but as we see, some survive.	2005-02-28

There is a lawyer and a judge, but they are totally insignificant characters that have no effect on the story.  Girsham left his law books at home on this one and picked up a football.<br /><br />BLEACHERS is a trip down memory lane.  It's onoe of those \\"you can't go home again\\" melodramas that is full of lost loves, shattered dreams and thought of what could have been.<br /><br />The plot centers on Coach Eddie Rake and the relationship he has with his players.  Football is a way of life in this small town and Rake is at its center.  The saying that there is a fine line between love and hate permeates this story.<br /><br />This is an extremely quick read, more akin to a short story or novella than a novel.

As I started the novel I wondered how they would all mesh. In many ways, this book is a \\"day in the life\\" of Holt, Col.

It's a period of change for all of them espcially Victoria and the two young boys, Bobby and Ike.  In fact it is a period of change for all of the characters, Tom, Maggie and the two McPherson brothers.<br /><br />I got the EVENTIDE out of the library.  It apparently continues the story.  I'm sure that I will read it, but I'm not sure if it had been better to leave the characters were they are at the end of PLAINSONG and let each reader speculate as to what happens to them; how this period of time and the changes they went through effected the rest of thief lives.	2005-02-15

Of the surface it relates the story of Livvy, who is pregnant and forced to marry a man that she does not know.  The story focuses on the evolution of their relationship and the changes in Livvy's life.  Her husband Ray, has the very appropriate last name of Singleton, because he is indeed a single, solitary man.<br /><br />But on a broader scale, there are a number of underlying themes that  the reader should be aware of. The first is the responsibility that people must take for their own acts and how what seem to be casual decisions about relationships can alter a person's life.<br /><br />Issues of family relationships are also brought out in the book. Most people will identify in some way with the relationships between the siblings. Women will contemplate what they would have done had they been Livvy - pregnant and without a husband in the early 1940's - and how their own father would have reacted.  The underlying issues of religion and a small community vs a large city are also present.<br /><br />Author Ann Howard Creel masterfully deals with a subject that is popular among historians and this is women on the home front during the time of war.  She also deals with men, such as Ray who does not go to war but still deals with issues of guilt.<br /><br />Creel's handling of the issues of Japanese interment is excellent.  It is a subject that many readers, espcially young readers will know little about.  So her even handed descriptions are informative. In addition, most Americans have little knowledge of the German and Italian POW's that came to America.<br /><br />The Hallmark Hall of Fame did a wonderful job with this novel, following almost exactly as Creel wrote it, although the did not use the first person. However, their ending was probably more acceptable to a general audience. The Japanese women in the novel to not fare as well as they did on TV. The sad part is that Rose and Lorelie were victimized by being put in the camp and then made bad decisions, just like Livvy, based on their desire to be loved.<br /><br />Although this book is well suited for young readers, and could be a useful tool in an educational environment, it is also an excellent read for readers of any age.  War has many ripple effects on the society and Creel deals with many of them.  This book gives much to reflect on.  I'm just glad that Hallmark brought it to light for millions of readers.re victimized by being put in the camp and then made bad decisions, just like Livvy, based on their desire to be loved. <br /> <br />Although this book is well suited for young readers, and could be a useful tool in an educational environment, it is also an excellent read for readers of any age.

Nella Larsen, a biracial woman, relates the story of Irene Redfield and Clare Kendry.  Both are fair skinned black women who can pass for white and grow up together in a black neighborhood. When Clare is orphaned she moves with white relatives and deserts her black heritage.  She sees it as the only means of escape from the poverty that she destest.  She marries John Bellows, escaping her past and could have disappeared into the white world.<br /><br />But through a chance meeting, where Irene is also passing for white, they meet after many years of separation. Irene has married a black doctor, who wants to move to Brazil and in effect pass as a latin American.  He wants physically out of America while Irene wants out of the racial tensions of America.<br /><br />Clare is drawn back to her racial roots by some mystery.  She can't let go even though she knows it will be the end of her marriage and perhaps the loss of her daughter.<br /><br />Clare's husband, John Bellows, is a avowed  racist who calls Clare \\"Nig\\" because he jokes that she is getting darker, totally unaware of her race.  Irene and another friend who is also passing endure Bellow's racist remarks but do not respond.<br /><br />The book takes place over about a 2 year period as Clare flirts with the danger of discovery and also Irene's husband. Irene is in conflict as to whether to reveal the truth to John, which would get Clare out of her life. But she can't bring herself to do it.<br /><br />The book tells of the conflict of being black and living white; it tells of the interracial circles of Harlem of the 1920's.  It's a period of high racial tensions, but yet whites flock to Harlem because some see it as in vogue not because they seek an interracial culture.<br /><br />Although Irene lives black, she has created a white world around herself. She doesn't want her sons to know about lynchings and racial issues.<br /><br />At the end Clare makes a tragic choice.  She chooses death over admitting that she is black.  Of course, maybe that is what she wanted all the time - out of this false world.  Irene gets her wish, she gets Clare out of her immediate life but she will never get her out of her memory.are makes a tragic choice.  She chooses death over admitting that she is black.

This is the question that I ask about Ella Lynch, the central character of Lily Tuck's THE NEWS FROM PARAGUAY.<br /><br />Ella, a divorcee living in Paris,  moves from her Russian lover to Franco, the son of the dictator of Paraguay.  Judging Ella on 21st century norms, she was an abused woman and with that mindset the reader wants to know why she stayed.  But the fact is, Ella had no place to go. Her fate was sealed when she left France with Franco and when get got pregnant. There was no way for her to turn back if she wanted to continue in the life style she wanted.  She chose her fate when she hooked her wagon to Franco's star and his money  and as a result she had to live with it.  She had good times but also many bad times.  It was her choice.<br /><br />The book depicts the brutality of life in the 19th century and the role of women in a culture where men ruled with an iron fist. I thought many of the characters were predictable.  It was not hard to predict that Franco would become more evil as he progressed.<br /><br />This was an interesting read, but clearly not great.  I felt that the reviews rated it far beyond it's real value.	2004-12-19

Half way through THE PLOT AGAINST AMERICA I was calling friends telling them they had to read this book.  Now that I've finished it, I'm not so excited.<br /><br />This was a fast read and extremely well written and exciting. The characters are made real and while it reading  one is tempted to make comparisons to recent crises in American political life.  Could such a thing happen?<br /><br />But somewhere in the last chapter the story gets confused.  I don't want to ruin the ending for anyone and I would recommend the book, but not the ending.  The characters where just left out there hanging. Did life return to any similarity of normalcy? I guess Roth wants the reader to decide.	2004-12-16

I came to learn that historians reevalute existing sources in light of new events and/or place their own unique perspecitve on the materials.<br /><br />In the case of Resa Willis' FDR AND LUCY, Willis did none of the above.  When a new book comes out on a subject in which one has interest, there is always  hope that there is some new sources or new perspective.  While doing a fine job of research and writing,  Willis adds nothing new to a story that came to light in the 1960's after the death of Eleanor.<br /><br />Willis quotes children and friends of FDR and Lucy Mercer but as another reviewer said - there's nothing new. The story is stretched a bit with the inclusion of lots of basic facts about American history.  There is a decent amount of information about the geneology of some of the characters, but other than showing the Mercer and FDR lived in a relatively close circle of friends and relatives, its old hat. She offers some speculation. Did FDR have an hand in arranging the marriage of Lucy and her husband Wintrop Rutherfurd.  But she offers no anwers.  She talks about FDR's circle of women friends but the author draws no conclusions about these relationships or how they reflected on FDR's personality.<br /><br />One of the amazing things about the relationship between FDR and Lucy is that the servants never talked. In the 21st century, all of the servants and secret service agents would have published tell all books.  As an African American, whose family lived in Aiken, I always found it amazing that no one in the African American community, who clearly would have served as servants, ever mentioned a visit from the President. I've looked for the railroad siding that was suppose to have been built to accomodate the President but have never figure out where it was.<br /><br />Willis takes no sides in relating her story. She relates the story of two people who had an affair and the came to be great friends.  She provides an insight in to life at the White House during the War years but there is little character development.<br /><br />If you know nothing about FDR and Lucy Mercer, read the book.  If you know the least little bit from previous readings, don't bother.t where it was. <br /> <br />Willis takes no sides in relating her story.

Somewhere along the line, I fell through the cracks and never read it.  I'm so happy that I finally took the time.  I suspect that it also fell out of favor in the 1970's because of US relations with China and a change in the historiography of Chinese Studies.<br /><br />Oprah's decision to use classics was very wise.  Millions of people are reading treasured books that would otherwise be sitting on library shelves. In the case of THE GOOD EARTH I got a copy at a used book store for 25 cents which sure beats some of the books that I've paid full price for and found disappointing.<br /><br />THE GOOD EARTH has many universal themes that will remain valid for generations.  These universal themes show that things don't change.  For all the middle aged men who get their \\"trophy\\" wives, THE GOOD EARTH would be a good case study for them.<br /><br />This book as been discussed, debated and analyzed far more then I can write in this review.  But it is easy to say that there is something for everyone, gems of wisdom, that will effect every reader.	2004-11-29

But I never got around to reading another Pat Conroy work until my son, who is in the Marines, gave me a copy of THE GREAT SANTINI.<br /><br />Written in 1976 but set in the American South on the early 1960's it describes a hard drinking brutal side of the Marine Corp air division, that is hopefully a thing of the past. With current pilots limited on their consumption of alcohol prior to flying and an entirely different attitude about drinking in the contemporary world, the descriptios of the binge drinking by Bull Meechum and his pilots was alarming and often disgusting.  The brutality among the Marines and the crude insults and language among them were not comical to me, but I'm judging them from a 21st century female perspective.<br /><br />The descriptions of the spousal and child abuse by Bull were hopefully a thing of the past, along with the horrible racial sterotypes and racial abuse.  We can only hope and pray that that generation of Americans no longer exist.<br /><br />If Ben Meechum were a real person, he would be in his early 60's as would his sister Mary Ann. Did Ben go in to the Marine Corp? One wonders what happened to Lillian Meechum after Bull's death and Karen and Matt. Was Lillian ever able to regain her own self respect and identity.  Throughout the book I wondered how she ever stayed with this abusive and crude man who abused her and her children, but considered in the context of the time, maybe she did not have a choice.<br /><br />The Meechums were a totally disfunctional family. One would like to speculate on how this effected the Meechum children and their children.<br /><br />It's a good read, but hopefully a part of America that no longer exist.	2004-11-14

US	53072584	ROT5CU7RMQUXQ	158621134X	265598858	Up Country	Books	4	2	3	N	N	A great audio book	Some time ago I listened to an abridged version of this novel on tape and enjoyed it a great deal. Subsequently I ran across the hard copy edition of the book and it has sat on my shelf for years. After reading some non fiction works on the Vietnam War, I decided to read a novel and ran across UP COUNTRY on my shelf.<br /><br />Nelson Demille is a master story teller and he is at his best in UP COUNTRY.  At the beginning of the book he sets up the plot and draws you into the story.  He then sends Paul Brenner, the main character and narrator to Vietnam to solve a crime.  Having traveled to Vietnam in 2012, I found the travelogue aspect of the book intriguing.  However, I'm sure it is a lot easier to travel in Vietnam now than it was at the time of the novel - which is around 2000 - although the dates are not set forth.<br /><br />I found the characters well developed and the plot was strong.  My only criticism is that I though that the trip from Saigon - Ho Chi Ming City - to the conclusion of the story in Hanoi.  I thought that part of the story could have been shortened by at least 100 pages  which is probably the reason that I liked the abridged version.  The relationship the Paul develops with Susan Weber is interesting but again, I thought it got dragged out.  The relationship between Paul and other characters tells a great deal about the intelligence committee and after seeing the interplay between the different branches - the FBI,  the CIA,  the Secret Service, etc - one wonders if this is any way to run a railroad.<br /><br />Demille brings the war and the experiences of combat soldiers to life and makes that experience very real.  There is a good deal of history of the War and persons who are interested in the subject will learn a great deal.  There are also meaningful insights in to the experiences of individual Vietnamese people and what happened to them after the war.<br /><br />This is a very long read but it moves along. For those interested in the Vietnam war and its long range consequences on the who served, those who did not serve, and the people of Vietnam it is extremely worthwhile.ences on the who served, those who did not serve, and the people of Vietnam it is extremely worthwhile.	2004-10-17
US	53072584	RHQ9NUJP53S46	1415902119	970276746	The Priestly Sins	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Rehash of a known topic	The 10 set compact disc version of Andrew Greeley's THE PRIESTLY SINS was appealing on the library shelf, so I gave it a try.  Many years ago I think that I read one or two  of Greeley's early works that at the time were shocking stories about what where then called wayward priest who dared to leave the priesthood. Now the subject is pretty common place. Greeley has since moved on and become a prolific writer, always dealing with some area of the topic he knows, the Catholic Church.<br /><br />In THE PRIESTLY SINS Greeley starts out with a bang in dealing with the very tragic stories of the abuse of children by priest. The first chapter deals with the testimony of Fr. Hugh Hoffman against a priest who has sexually abused a young boy and is very moving.  From there the book goes into the life of Fr. Hoffman.  Although interesting, I thought there was too much time on Hoffman, his background, he love life, his education and his work as a priest.<br /><br />Although I found the book interesting, I was so very tired of the repeated references to Hoffman's German/Russian background. It were as if his life and anyone else with the same background had their fate cast in stone because of it.  Every Irish person was a certain way. Every German/Russian person was of a certain persuasion.  I was about to scream every time it the subject was brougt up again.  Since there were no African American characters, Greeley did not have to deal with the subject, but I wonder how he would have characterized them?  To Greeley one's heritage relative to their nationality is the defining characteristic of their existence.<br /><br />All in all, it was a decent book, but certainly not great. Jonathan Morosz does an excellent job in preforming this unabridged version.	2004-10-17

Pope Joan was a book that was recommended by Amazon as a book that a reader that liked Da Vince would also enjoy. I did a little research and actually wanted to read another book about Pope Joan. When I went to the library Donna Cross's was the only one available.  What a fortunate situation!<br /><br />I was enthralled by this book. It was interesting and readable and the sad and tragic part is that a lot of the fews of women have not really changed that much. Readers learn many of the myths that men perpetuated over the centuries.<br /><br />I would definately recommend this book to young women who feel that they cannot achieve.  Joan showed that women a overcome adversity.<br /><br />At times some of the coincidences were a little far fetched and its sometimes hard to believe that Joan pulled this off, but it was a different world.<br /><br />This book has encouraged me to read other books on the same subject.  It's great!	2004-08-27

The book, which I listened to on audio cassette, is full of stories about African Americans who played their part in World War II inspite of the hardships heaped upon them by our own government. As was said in a World War I motto:  The colored man is no slacker.  Unfortunately many of the stories of these brave fighting men have been lost.  Some are  are just now coming to light.<br /><br />Kareem Abdul Jabbar makes a significant contribution to African American history by telling readers about the 761st.  This work clearly demonstrates that black men did more than just service jobs in the war. At least one other reviewer was critical of some of the details of the combat missions and those assertions may be true. What is important for all Americans to understand is the extent of prejudice that existed in America in the 1940's.  As a historian I have heard the accounts of Jackie Robinson's court marshall for refusing to sit on the back of the bus. I know that German prisoners of war were treated better than returning black GI's in some situations.  But what is important is that the rest of America know what happened so that we can make sure it never happens again.  What was redeeming was the accounts of the 761st return to a former base in a Southern city, where local residents apologized for their parents and grandparents.<br /><br />I found the most meanningful section of the audio cassette on the final disk that included interviews with several of the men that fought in the 761st.  After all that they endured, they were all still proud to be Americans.	2004-08-20

By in large the characters are predictiable as is the story line.  There's nothing new except for the fact that the main characters are black.  There are a few interesing twists at the end of the story, but for the most part the book rings of a made for TV movie. I can easily see Denzel Washington in the part of Sterling and a James Earl Jones type as Wilson, as seen in flash backs.  I predict the story will eventually make the silver screen or video market.  It certainly will not make a best seller list.<br /><br />If you are on a flight and have some time on your hands THE BLACKBIRD PAPERS  is an ok read to pass the miles. It was refreshing to see black characters who are intelligent and successful, but for the most part this is a so/so detective story with some racial overtones which disappear after the first few chapters.  Past that, the characters are about as black as Clarence Thomas.<br /><br />As is common in contemporary literature, environmental issues are the key to the story with the pro environmental side versus big business thrown into an academic setting. There is even a Native American twist.  But there just weren't any surprises.<br /><br />Sterling is a classic of the detective/police officer/FBI agent type. They all live in disorganized apartments, have a series of women, fast cars, bend the rules when they feel like it  and deal with issues in their past. When some of Sterling's past issues are revealed  one comes to realize that in the real world Sterling would not have qualified as an FBI agent. But with all such characters, their sorted past makes them who they are. Smith used a traditional and well worn cookie cutter to create Sterling,  but just colored the cookie brown.  Smith found other well worn  cookie cutters for most of the other characters: the local police,  the old friend in the FBI, the professor who was his mentor, old girl friends, etc.<br /><br />I commend anyone who write a completed work of fiction and gets it published. It's not an easy task.  The author has an impressive resume and background and I am sure that is the reason the book was published.  From a lesser personage, I doubt if a major publisher would have taken a second look at this rather mediocre and predictable work./> <br />I commend anyone who write a completed work of fiction and gets it published.

I remember reading ATONEMENT and AMSTERDAM with anticipation and was somewhat disappointed.<br /><br />McEwan, as in his other works, surely looks at the dark side of life and romance.  THE COMFORT OF STRANGERS is even darker than the other works that I've read.  During a time when travelers are already leary of traveling and other travelers, \\"Comfort\\" adds even a darker deminsion.<br /><br />This is a book that I surely would not have finished had I been reading it in hard copy. However, narrator Simon Prebble, does a wonderful job or acting out the parts and captivating the listener.<br /><br />There are many lurid and dark underlying themes to this work. It makes one reflect on relationships and love but not always in a comforting manner.<br /><br />My warning is, read it at your own risk and surely not close in time to a vacation at a seaside resort.	2004-08-10

Somewhere in my literary past I read EAST OF EDEN and my memory of the book is positive.<br /><br />However, over the last week or so of driving and doing mindless tasks around my house, I listened to Richard Poe's reading of EAST OF EDEN.  The resonant tones of Poe's voice mixed with the masterful story telling of John Steinbeck make for a magical experience.<br /><br />For those who do not appreciate the classics and do not understand the power of Steinbeck, I urge you to listen to Poe's version. He makes the characters come alife. You can feel the evil of Kate and the wisdom of Lee. You can feel the pain of Cal and Aron and struggle that they lived.<br /><br />EAST OF EDEN is a wonderful and power story that recreates the story of Cain and Abel.  There are a thousand term papers and phd dissertation in this work.

This theme is pervasive though the stories of presidential children.  The author rightfully points out the pressure on presidential children, even before our current media emphasis on the White House and its occupants.<br /><br />But there seems to be a bit of historial snobbery in the thesis.  That is to say, well into the 19th century, children were seen as little adults. The distance between presidents and their children was not merely a presidential \\"flaw.\\"  It was not uncommon for children  to be sent to  boarding schools and farmed out by parents. Child labor was not seen as a social evil.  It was a different society and we should not impose our 20th century values on 18th and 19th century.  Family life was different in certain sections of the society.  Children were often raised by care givers rather than parents in certain levels of the society.<br /><br />There is a great deal of valuable information relating to  scions of presidents and some great points of trivia.  The writing is straight forward and no frills.  The stories prior to 1950 seem to be more comprehensive and readable perhaps because the subsequent children are still alive and it is impossible to put them into true historical context.<br /><br />I read the large print edition of this work.  Though this is not my usual medium, it is not the first large print that I ever read. However, the set up of the pages and the lack of an index made finding information difficult, unless you read the work like a novel.  If looking for stories about specific person, there was no way to do it.<br /><br />Appendix A, which is a chronological list of the presidential children was helpful in supplying basic information, but the chapter headings do not disclose the persons discussed.<br /><br />The author did an admirable job. The printer of the large print edition did him a disservice.a disservice. <br /> <br />	2004-08-07

However, I have read my fair share of books on her life and that of FDR. As a result, I thought I was aware of ER's circle of friends and the people who shared a close relationship with her. When I discovered KINDRED SOULDS - THE FRIENDSHIP OF ELEANOR ROOSEVELT AND DAVID GUREWITSCH on audiocassete at my local library it came as a welcome surprise. David Gurewitsch was a name that was new to me.<br /><br /> Edna P. Gurewitsch's 2002 book is a memorable history of the relationship between the author's husband, Dr. David Gurewitsch and ER. Based mainly on letters between ER and Dr. Gurewitsch and journals along with Edna's memories, the book presents a charming portrait of Mrs. Roosevelt as a pragmatic, driven, thoughtful, quirky, emotional and sometimes difficult friend. The relationship that developed first beween ER and David, who was ER's physician, and later with the addition of Edna when they married, makes for an interesting insight into the dynamics of this unique set of human relationship. Did ER really love David, a man many years her junior, and resent the intrusion of Edna? Did she finally come to accept this &quot;other woman&quot; in a strange threesome in order to maintain her relationship with David? These are questions that no one can answer and one that the prospective reader can ponder for themselves.<br /><br /> The Roosevelt children do not fair wll throughout the book, which covers the last years of Mrs. Roosevelt's life. They come across as seemingly lacking concern for their mother, going to her when they were in financial straights, especially Elliot and living lives where they believed that the society owes them a great deal because of their place in history as Roosevelts. It becomes almost trite to talk about the result of a dysfunctional family, but it's the only thing that seems to fit after listening to Edna describe ER's relationship with her children. Surprisingly, the references to FDR are few and far between. Edna speaks from the prospective of those who argue that ER took on a new persona as her own person after her husband's death and moved on with her life.<br /><br /> As I said, I don't claim to be an expert on ER, however, I know that she was extremely close to Joseph Lash. Then there is the rumored relationship with her one time driver, state trooper,Earl Miller, both of whom were younger than ER. There was ER's life long friendship (allegedly lesbian) with Lorena Hitchock and her interesting relationship with other women. And these are just the ones that I remember.<br /><br /> As a prolific letter writer ER left a great legacy in her writing. The thousands of letters addressed to &quot;my dearest friend&quot; with comments of &quot;how much I love and miss you&quot; were left behind for historians now to consider. Are we now judging her late Victorian style by 21st century standards? Were these loving comments a result of ER's loneliness and her desire to be loved in return? Only a psychologist can figure that one out.<br /><br /> ER clearly had a close relationsip with Edna and David. Such is evidenced by the fact that she chose to live the last years of her life with them. She traveled with them, spent weekends and evenings with them, and basically made them her family, based on Edna's account. Although Edna talks about ER's many circle of friends, how they also interacted in her life or spent time with her, I came away feeling that there was a part of ER's life that was left out in this particular picture. According to Edna, ER's life was totally encompassed in that of her and her husband to the exclusion of others.<br /><br /> For those who know a good deal about Eleanor Roosevelt, this is an interesting read. As I stated, I listened to it on audiocassette. The reader did a good job of varying her voice but I feel that there were several mispronunciations of proper names. The work included interesting politicalinsights of mid 20th century politicians, especially Adlai Stevenson and JFK. But fitting the Gurewitsch's into the greater picture of ER's life is, I believe, still open for debate. In hindsight history is always reveaaed in the light most favorable to the writer, especially one who claims to have the close personal friends of a famous person. However, I would love to hear other views of the relationship between David Gurewitsch, Edna Gurewitsch and Anna Eleanor Roosevelt.

I often wonder how and if I would have survived. Many friends and clasmates either went or figured out a way not to go. Some did not return and those who did were often changed. Few of those who did return talked about it. You stand at the Viet Nam Wall in Washington and wonder about the stories behind each name and wonder what it was really like; what really happened; how did were the lives of those who survived changed; what part of themselves did they leave in Viet Nam? After reading CARL MELCHER GOES TO VIETNAM, in some small way I feel that I can fill in some of the blanks.<br />The story is short but intense.  It tells the story of one man's experiences in the war, his brushes with fate and his ultimate survival.  The first two thirds of the book sets up the plot and develops the character of Carl Melcher. I'm sure that his character is representative of many young men who went to the Nam. The story pulls together in the last third of the book and the reader does a great deal of speculating about &quot;what if&quot; - what choices were made for Carl and what choices did he make himself.<br />Many of the characters are representative. I felt that the character of Carl's Vietnamese girl friend could have been a bit more developed. However, perhaps the author wanted to give her an almost dream like image - was she really real of a figment of Carl's imagination - part of his love hate relationship with Viet Nam.<br />One of the other reviewers suggested that this work would be excellent for students who did not live through the Viet Nam experience.  I totally agreee with that.  It allows the read to &quot;live&quot; Viet Nam, to smell the smells and feel the heat. The story is not new. But it gives a real insight into a war that continues to fascinate the American people and will be the subject of continued writing for generations to come.	2004-07-20

Since I am the same age as Zinni  I would probably have been in the military with Zinni but for the fact that I am female. Zini's courage and reasoning and ultimate change in philosopby about the explanation for the War in Viet Nam was intersting and highly commendable.  Since I have a son in the Marines, his insights into the Marine Corp and its mentality was also interesting.  But as with most books by former service persons, I got tired of descriptions of General So and So, &quot;one of the finest officers I've ever served with.&quot;  Maybe it just comes with the turf, but there was a lot of that.  No one was a rotten SOB and I'm sure that he met a few.<br />One of the problems with the book it too many authors. Perhaps the old adage about too many cooks, also goes along with too many authors. There were too many voices.  This made the message very mixed.<br />If you want a biography of an officer and his career, read the book. But the criticisms of the current political and military situations that Zinni voiced on TV are not in the book. His message is that the military is not prepared for the current world situation and that the military changes very slowly. But it takes a whole book about many other subjects before he gets to that.	2004-07-12

The editors did a great job of making sure that every statement is documented.

This book got a lot of press when it first came out but I resisted the urge to pay full price for it.  A few months ago I found it on the sale table and took the plunge.  I still never got around to reading it, but then ran across it on audio cassettes in the library.  Thank goodness for audio cassettes - in this case all 16 or so of them.<br />I must commend the narrator who was very good - all except for his voice of Bently, Talcot's little boy. I found it irratating.<br />It seems to me that the author had to put in every character and plot and sub plot  he ever thought about using in a work of fiction.  And all of the characters had flaws.<br />Frankly, I have to admit that I would never have gotten through this book had I read it. Conversations that should have lasted a minute or so to get the message across lasted 2 and 3 minutes. Didn't the author recognize when he made his point?<br />I assume he wanted to make it clear that there is a black middle class and that the have the same problems as the white middle class.  Ok, you made the point.<br />I couldn't figure out what Talcot saw in Kimmer. She was miserable and a real......, well supply your own word.<br />I'd recommend this book on tape, but I don't know that I would recommend anyone the torture of reading it word for word.	2004-05-08

My male classmates in college and law school were shipped off or found ways to avoid the draft. Some went to Canada and one, someone I recently met, went to prison.  Had I been a male I'm sure that I would have thought I had to do my duty.<br />So never having gone to war it's hard to imagine how it would really be.  Tim O'Brien brings it home in THE THINGS THEY CARRIED. I listened to the audio version and the narrator was excellent. Had I attempted to book, I'm not sure that I would have made it through.<br />Listening to the recording is a moving experience.  I've always wanted to go to Viet Nam.  After listening to the tape I'm more convinced than ever that I want to go. I want to experience the country.  Certainly it will never be like it was for the men who went there during the war.<br />As a single black woman of 59 I often think that the husband that I should have married lost his life in Viet Nam. The war killed of a generation of black men, both physically and mentally. A guy that I used to date is still alive but he lost his soul there. Listening to this tape made me understand the Viet Nam experience in a heart wrenching manner.	2004-03-19

John Caro touches on the relationship and as a result I was interested in finding out more about these two masters of the senate.<br />Goldsmith, who was a Washington insider, depicts the rise and fall of the friendship and shows how in some respects it disentigrated because of the passage of time and the failure of the two men, especially Russell to adopt to change.<br />Goldsmith's LBJ is much less of a &quot;user&quot; of Russell than Caro's and Goldsmith's Russell is much for fragile than the one portrayed by Caro.  But for those interested in the LBJ years and the beginnings of the war in Viet Nam, this is a meaningful work.  LBJ is once again seen as a somewhat tragic figure.  Russell was very much a father figure to him, but yet in the end he did not attend his funeral or visit him in his last illness.<br />For those interested in the legacy of LBJ it is well worth the fairly quick read.	2003-12-24

In response to his rhetorical question, Wright pointed out the revisionist work of Robert Paxton - VICHY FRANCE - OLD GUARD AND NEW ORDER 1940 - 1944.  Paxton challenged the traditinal myths of French resistence and atacked France's edited memory of their collaboration with the Germans. Eric T. Jennings demonstrates that he is an heir to Paxton's revisionism in this work. Through the use of a comparative study of three colonial possessions in the outer reaches of the French Empire from 1940 - 1944, Jennings describes and interprets Marshall Petain's unique brand of colonialism, a subject, according to Jennings, that has been largely ignored by other historians.<br />The gist of Jenning's argument is that in the selected colonies, there was no German presence. With no Germans, he questions why the Vichy colonial officials were so repressive. A recurring theme in the three exampes cited is the underlying rejection of republicanism in the colonies by the French administratin.  Jennings demonstrates the points made by Paxton, namely, that the Vichy government, in the metropole and in the colonies went beyond what the Germans required in terms of anti Semitism, ultra conservatism, authoritarianism and anti republicanism and formulated policies and practices that were anti Masonic, anti Communistic and ardently Catholic.<br />Prior to the coming of the Vichy government, colonial administrators, particulary in Guadeloupe advocated assimilation and officially per pounded ideas of &quot;Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity.&quot; In Madagascar and Indochina the colonies could anticipate at best an association with France. But at heart of the colonial empire, even before the Vichy government, was a belief in Social Darwinism that saw the indigenous people of the colonies as proper subjects for domination, not citizens of France. True equality had never really been anticipated. So when the opportunity present itself the true colors of the colonial administrators emerged.<br />Jennings argued that the repressive tactics of the French colonial administration back fired on the French. Little did they realize that the tactics galvinized dissent in the colonies and provided unintended fertilizer for the already fertile ground of colonial nationalism.  To Jennings, the four years he described mark a crossroads of colonialism and post colonialism.<br />Jennings, however, gives no agency to the indigeous people. It seems to me that there would have been strong nationalist movements even without the pressure from the French.  In addition, I think that Jennings gives to much credence to de Gaulle and the Free French.  Jennings uses local records to present a part of French history that has been ignored by other historians. The book considers a subject that is in much need or research for its own sake and for its impact on the subject of Vicy France and French mentalities.pated.

Sherman brings a background in interdisciplinary studies to this work.  It is the second of his major publications, the first being WORTHY MONUMENTS: ART MUSEUMS AND THE POLITICS OF CULTURE IN 19TH CENTURY FRANCE, published in 1989.  Through the use of numerous photographs taken by the author and relying on primary and secondary sources, the current work is in some respects a history of public art in France. But to describe Sherman's work soley on such a superficial basis is only to scratch the surface of this complex psychological analysis of French culture.<br />Sherman imposes a non traditonal approach as he looks at how the French remembered and memorialized World War I.  What evolves is a description of the thought processes of the French people used in the conceptualization, financing, placing and building of monuments and the long range impact of these decisions on French culture.  Sherman goes beyond the practical aspects of bricks and mortar, architectural plans and the number of francs necessary for the construction of monuments. He deals, however, with space,place and institutions of art and politics along with the mental processes and group dynamics of individual projects.  He discusses the impact of tourism associated with the war and how villages sought to return to normalcy while surrounded by battlefields that other considered sacred ground. He writes about the conflicts between families that wanted the return of war dead and the government who wanted them buried in battlefield cemeteries.<br />With a sprinkling of Sigmund Freud and Michel Foucault, Sherman seemingly puts the French naiton on a couch and delves into its psyche. Like the person who has suffered a tragic loss, Sherman attempts to determine the ramifications of the nation's pain as a result of the Great War and how the collective and individual memories of the war merged. He accomplishes this task by presenting numerous examples, perhaps to many, of individual villages and town and their conflicts with the national government relative to memorializing. At the essence of his duscussion is how the past is fashioned by a society and how commemoration of the Great War is now a part of French culture.<br />This is not a book for the unskilled reader. Individual sentences are often replete with underlying meanings and could be the subject of hearty debate.  The reader should also note that the author sets up his own definitions in the introduction of some of the terms he uses.  This introduction also does a good job of setting the historiographic stage for Sherman's thesis which is not merely looking at the monuments but putting them into the perspective the French national memory. Within the context of reading and understanding French history it is a valuable work.

In this ground breaking work of revisionist political history and anyalysis, Marx rejects the tradionally held asumptions regarding the originis of Western nationalism. Marx goes about systemically challenging traditional scholarship that places the roots on nationalism 18th and 19th century political engagement, allegiance to the secular power of emerging states, liberalism, torelation and inclusiveness. According to Marx, nationalism was not a product of the Enlightenment.  Its birth did not coincide with the rights and toleration of England's constituional monarchy and it was not epitomized by the motto of the French Revolution, &quot;liberty, equality and fraternity.&quot;<br />Through the use of a comparative study of the three great Atlantic seaboard powers of early modern Western Europe, Spain, France and England, Marx shows that the origins of nationalism are in fact sinister, illiberal rather than liberal. Going back two centuries earlier than traditional thought and relying on original sources and the analysis of current day scholars, he revelas the dirty little secret that Western nationalism evolved through a process of exclusion rather than inclusion and form internal discord over religion, usually in the form of religious fanaticism. He shows the church as a tool to facilitate the exclusion of Jews in Spain, the oppression of religious sects in England and France, and sometimes murder so that like minded people could feel a sense of commonality outside the local community and for an allegiance to a central government. Although each of the countries under consideration have different histories, which Marx recounts for the reader, he shows similarities amoung them in terms of structural logic.<br />Essention to the process of nation buidling is the transfer of power from local to central rulers. While arguing that the most effective way of transferring that power was religion and fanatical passions, Marx also shows that in most cases this process was not the result of spontaneous social  forces but effectuated by policies initiated by powerful fources at the center of the society that ultimately controlled the periphery. Absolutist rulers of the early  modern European states all shared a desire to build coherence and loyalty of their subjects in order to bolster their own authority. However, the more the populace below became engaged, the more control from above was lost. He demonstrates a shifting of social controls from the center to the periphery and occasions when the centter totally lost control, suas as the Saint Bartholomew's massacre.<br />At first glance, FAITH IN NATION is a difficult and complex work. However, once the reader comprehends the basic thesis of the book, he is thrown into a challenging and fascinating discussion of the roots of contemporary world politics which culminates in the final chapter in the discussion of St. Bartholomew as the possible patron saint of nationalism.  The conlusion is grim but insightful.  Marx subtletly raises imponderable questions regarding the origins of the Holocaust, ethnic cleansing in Albania and tribal wars in Ruaunda and even race relations in the US. In this post 9/11 work, where Americans ponder the question of why parts of the world hate us and what would drive others to seek the destruction of our way of life, Marx raises fascinating questions for discussion and debate.  His scholarshp challenges traditional thinking on nationalism but it goes further than that. It challenges the Western reader to reconsider their heritage and perspective on the world in which we live and question the theological backgrounds of our world.guing that the most effective way of transferring that power was religion and fanatical passions, Marx also shows that in most cases this process was not the result of spontaneous social  forces but effectuated by policies initiated by powerful fources at the center of the society that ultimately controlled the periphery.

However, I felt that there were several themes: the two young people who both lost thier mothers, the return of a native son who had lived away and has to readjust to his small time life, the brutality of the South, and of course issue of race at it relates to Riley and Crystal, and  the relationship between Fletcher and his father. Then there was the subplot about the murder  of the black man and the body buried in the woods. But with all of these themes going, for some reason they just didn't pull together.  It seemed that the author threw a lot of stuff at the reader and then just didn't develop it.<br />The relationship between Haley and Bo was incestuous in a way since Bo stood as a father figure.  But once again, I felt that it was not completely developed.<br />This book starts out and ends well, but I thought that the middle dragged somewhat. The author has her characters drink and smoke constantly.  I felt like I had a hangover at times when reading this book.<br />There is a great tradition of Southern writers and Kinsbury is trying to find her place in that gengre.  This, her first attempt is an able try.  It's good but not great.  It's almost as if she is trying to get in too many stories into one plot. For example, the relationship between Julian the cleaning man and Rosa, the woman in the wheelchair kind of left me hanging.<br />However, did feel that she wrapped up her story well, and perhaps left her self room for a sequeal.	2003-08-08

Listening to the comments it sounded like my kind of book.  However, the commentator did remark that it was not a book for young readers, hinting at the sisister conclusion.<br />I actually liked the first half of the book, but it seemed that somewhere around the last third or so a decidedly dark side emerges and I think its fair that prospective readers should be aware of it.<br />The book is well written and the plot is well thought out. Several other reviewers have compared this book to THOSE LOVELY BONES and its a ligitimate comparison. There are some similarities as to the flow of the book and the underlying evil that is the basis of the plot.<br />Half way through the book I would have recommended it.  By the end, I'm not so sure.  For some reason, the conclusion just didn't work for me.  The enchaniting Lexy of the first part of the book turns in to a deceitful person by the end.  I'm very leary of these &quot;perfect relationships&quot; and maybe that's one of the things that bothered me about Lexy and the narrator.  Perhaps their relationship was too perfect.  And it was certainly too perfect for the husband to recognize Lexy's intentions.<br />For a book club, it's probably a good choice because it raises many topics for discussion. There is a lot of symbolism in the plot with the masks.  Even the thing with the square eggs which started the relationship.  Eggs are not square.  The attempt to change them is very symbolic in terms of the entire plot.  When Lexy and the narrator first meet, she doesn't want to end their first date, but yet she ends the relationship by her death.  All this makes for great discussion.<br />But I believe the basic message is that you have to accept people and animals for what they are. Lexy was not going to change.  Her husband should have seen that. Dogs don't talk and the narrator should have seen that also. Life is the way it comes.  When you try to change the basic building blocks of life you screw up big time.y to change the basic building blocks of life you screw up big time.	2003-07-30

Forty years later it's interesting to look back.<br />In preparation for a trip to Dallas, I read THE DAY KENNEDY WAS SHOT.  As the owner of many, many books on JFK and the assassination and a real Kennedy buff, I had a lot to chose from. In fact, I had started Manchester's NOVEMBER 1963.<br />If you want a real feel for the time period and the chaos of that terrible day in Dallas, I would recommend Bishop.  For those of us who loved John Kennedy, it's refreshing to read about JFK with out the comments about his womanizing. You see him as a loving family man with a totally devoted staff.  In some respects I probably learned more details that I wanted to know. If you want to read about the autopsy and the embalming and all the minor details of the day, this should be your pick.  YOu find that lots of people are shown to clay feet, especially Jackie.<br />Even if you are a conspiracy buff, it's interesting to see the roots of some of the theories that emerged over the next 40 years. For instance, I found the comments about the relationship between Jackie and Bobbie interesting because some years ago someone alleged that they had an affair after JFK's death.<br />The descriptions of the blacks in the tale are interesting.  Comments are made like &quot;a Negro man...&quot;  But this was 1963.  I did however think that Bishop glorified JFK's civil rights record.<br />If you want to feel &quot;The Way We Were&quot; in 1963 and the real personal tradegy of the day read this book. JFK lost his life, but a nation lost its innocence. His staff and cabinet lost a friend and cause.  It's excellent background for anyone interested in JFK and his tragic death.	2003-07-26

There was a category for each movie and also a \\"spoilers\\" room.  The warning was, don't enter this room if you had not seen the movie because the plot would be given away.  In many respects, I wish that there was such a category on Amazon for books in which reviewers could express and discuss thier opinions about falicies in plots of novels that they reviewed thereby giving away the ending.  THE KITCHEN BOY would be prime for such a discussion.<br />All in all its an interesting read for those who loved Nicholas and Alexander and all variations on that theme, especially those who believe that there were survivors. As one who have always been facinated by the last days of the Tsar and his family I jumped at the chance of reading this book when a friend loaned it to me. I'm probably just as glad that I didn't buy it.<br />This is a very quick read, only 228 pages, and the story is easy to follow.  The author brings in good details and from prior readings that I've done seems to be historically correct.  He sets up the plot in clever and interesting manner and there is some good forshadowing to give the reader hints as to the outcome. But his choice of a final ending was a surprise and not one that I was really pleased with. It left me very troubled and raises the question \\"what would I have done in that situation?\\" That surprise ending bothered me although part of that ending became very predictible.<br />The book is good, not great, but I'd recommend it if you are interested in the subject. It might also be interesting for high school students to get them into the subject of Russian history. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to read this one, but it's worse the read.  But you may be trouble by the ending.	2003-07-18

Nor was she apparently concerned about other woman and one of the worlds most eligible batchleors.<br />And no one in Jordan suspected anything.  The other odd part of the story is that according to Lisa, she never had a boyfriend of any kind. Now, she does not come out and say that, but she never mentions one male friend: not a date to the highschool prom, a classmate or co workers, not even a casual date.  Now that's a little hard to believe.  According to her, she had no male friends and no female friends either.<br />The reader also has to realize that Lisa's story was not a rags to riches.  Her father made lots of money in the airline industry and was the FAA director for JFK although her mother was always complaining.  That's why I was a little surprised when then Lisa's mother had reservations about her daughter marrying one of the riches men in the world.<br />For a perspective of the Arab/Israeli question for the Arab and Jordianian point of view, Queen Noor's story is interesting and gives a good perspective.  However, I would have though that she would have had better ghost writers.<br />The Queen, who does a good bit of name dropping, is suddently best friends with all of the worlds royalty. However, she starts the book saying that she can't make friends and has no friends to discuss the forthcoming marriage to Hussein. She never deals with her lose of American citizenship, or her change in religion which would seem to be a crises in most peoples lives. She just did it. According to her, everything thing in her life with Hussein was pretty great. She mentions a few problems with step children and rumors of the King and other women, but everything according to her was blissful.  She marries the king, everything is happy and she has babies.  The only problems she discusses are political.<br />As a resident of the City of Cleveland, I was pretty surprised when the Queen mentions in passing that her husband went to a \\"clinic in Cleveland\\" when he was ill. In the next paragraph she does mention the Cleveland Clinic, but as I recall the city and the clinic did a lot for the King when he was here.<br />Only in a letter that the King wrote to her on their 10th anniversary to you get in feel for Hussein's feelings for the Queen and the final part of the book regarding the king's illness, which I thought was too short, was touching.<br />All in all the book is a defense of Hussein's position in the Middle East and in history.  It touches only lightly on the real Lisa Halaby/Queen Noor.<br />Americans are fascinated with Grace Kelly and I guess that Queen Noor falls in the same category.  However, all in all, she comes across in the book as extremely shallow.  It would be interesting to read a bio of the wife of an Israeli prime minister and compare the two but for telling her story, Queen Noor didn't do a very good job in convincing me.  You don't see Lisa Halaby change to Queen Noor. She see Queen Noor telling you what she wants you to hear and believe.<br />I was also disappointed that she gave no information about her current life post-Hussein. That would have been interesting and could have made a good conclusion.  She ends her story with the death of her husband.  Maybe that's the way she sees life.e just did it.

I picked it up because the price was right and I'm always interested as to why certain books get a Pulitzer Prize.<br />With no knowlege of Kennedy and his work, I did some research before I started the book.  An outline that I found on line with discussion questions for each chapter was great.  Getting background on the characters is a must for this book.<br />This is not an easy read and would be totally confusing if the reader did not understand the technique that the author uses wherein he has the dead talking to the main character.<br />In some respects this book is like THE GRAPES OF WRATH. It is about the permanent underclass and how they live. It is about a man that is hopelessly lost in a situation of proverty.  He has caused the death of his own son and other men and in a sense he is cursed.  But Francis does have a good side that shows throughout the book.<br />There are tragic women in the story and tragic lives of men who have chosen a path in life that has no happy ending.<br />IRONWEED is certainly not long.  Once you get into the characters its a fascinating story.  I can understand why it received the prize.	2003-06-22

Kennedy, 1917-1963	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Popular history - not an expose	I want to premise my remarks by stating that I am a real JFK afficianado.  I probably own more books on JFK and the assasination than most major libraries.  Saying that, I was excited about Robert Dallek's new book.<br />The media attention this book received lead me to believe that there would be a great deal of new information.While I enjoyed the book, I didn't find anything really new.<br />For fans of Jackie and the children, they are rarely mentioned.<br />Dallek concludes that JFK was not affected by all of the medication that he was taking.  I'm not a doctor and don't have a medical background, but based on what JFK was taking and with the mix of doctors treating him, it's hard to believe that all of these drugs did not affect him to a greater extent than Dallek lets on.  Although there is a great deal of discussion of JFK's back problems in the first half of the book, Dallek asserts that a program of excercise and swimming helped the President during the last two years of his life, so Dallek de-emphasises the subject.<br />Dallek's view of the media coverup of JFK's sex life is interesting and not new, but he puts it into an interesting context. He asserts that just like the media cover up FDR's wheelchair, they covered up JFK and LBJ's sexual encounters.<br />While advance reviews of the book concentrate on this area of JFK's life, it is only a minor part of the story that Dallek tells.<br />Mature readers have to realize that this book is written for a new generation that did not remember the events of the early 1960's. Most earlier works assume that the reader is not new to the subject.<br />Although the work is footnoted, it is not in the traditional form. As a result it is difficult to check actual sources.<br />It's a good read, but I can't say it's great.	2003-06-01

That coupled with the fact that it was a New York Times Best Sellor lead me to believe that it would be really great. And for the first third of the book that's what I thought.  In viewing the Amazon reviews I noted a few critics but blew them off.  About a third of the way into the book my mind kept going back to the critics and I kept thinkig how right they were.<br />  The first part of the story about Lily's life with her father and her \\"escape\\" with Rosaleen is intriguing. It's well done and keeps your interest. But when Lily and Rosaleen get to the \\"pink house\\" and are taken in by the sisters everything seems to go into fantasy land.<br />  I am African American and went to college in 1963 so I remember those years well.  In all of the turmoil that the author says in going on in the town, Lily and Zach are just driving around town and no one notices, especially in the scene where the bottle is thrown at the white men. Now this is not that long after Emmette Till is lynched for looking at a white woman in Mississippi. And what about Zach's parents? The author must have gotten the image or Rosaleen off an old Aunt Jemimah box.  Are we to beleive that Rosaleen had no family, friends or obligations even if she was in trouble with the law.<br />  For the second third of the book I just wanted to yell out at Lily, \\"TELL THE TRUTH.\\"  Here these folks have taken you in and you continue to lie and decieve them.  When she finally finds out about her mother, I wanted to yell out \\"GET OVER IT.\\"  And  the coincidence of Lily finding August is just to far fetched to believe. The author could have left some clues for her to follow, but just to think that she walks into this town and finds them is too much to believe.<br />  The story is a nice fantasy but the characters are not real at all.  The whole deal about the cult of Mary and the black women isn't even believable.  And how the heck did Lily get registered in school?  She is a minor and the Boatwright's had no legal custody of her.  Her father could have easily gone to court and gotten her back.  And one more point that bothered me. There is a real problem in the story about time. I was reading along and thought long periods of time had passed and then the author tells you it's only been a week or a few days. The time sequence is very confusing.<br />  I hope that I'm not the only one that feels this way. But as far as I'm concerned this book is totally overated.Lily get registered in school?

As a result, I'm sure that there are persons who will question aspects of Carol Ann Lee's thesis about Otto Frank, his relations with the Germans her theory on who turned the Franks in.<br />Many years ago in high school I read the diary and have read the recent biography of Anne. So I certainly don't claim to be an expert. But the story has always intigued me and when I heard The Hidden Life of Otto Frank on public radio I ordered the book.<br />Lee makes an interesting argument and gives a facinating view of Otto. She makes him come to life and you see him outside of the attic and feel the pain that he suffered. Those interested in Anne's story, Otto's life and the way Otto marketed the diary will enjoy the book.  It's also interesting to see the conflicts that arose as to what the emphasis of Anne's story should be.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who has read the diary. It's a quick read and very interesting.	2003-02-22

Like other reviews, I read this book because of the Pulitzer Prize and because I wanted to read it before I saw the much acclamed movie.  It's a very quick read and there is a great deal of beautiful prose. But I concluded it wondering what's the big deal.  I also wondered what qualifies a book for a prize like the Pulitzer.<br />As a life long resident of the mid-west and a person that most people would consider &quot;normal&quot; I contemptated the characters in the book and wondered if there were really people like this. Are there people who live there lives with such pain, such bizarre relationships, so many painful memories of the past?<br />In many respects this is a book about aging. It's about people moving toward the ends of their lives.  Frankly, it's depressing. It's about people whose children don't turn out exactly the way they want and mothers who screw up children's lives. It's about long term relationships that are not always as beautiful as they start out. Perhaps that's just life.<br />Would I recommend this book?  Probably, but it's not exactly what I thought it was going to be.	2003-01-26

The author creates a story line that give Ilsa and Rick and past and a future.  The problem is that we all remember Ilsa walking off into the foggy night with Victor. Somewhere deep in each persons heart you think of the person that you really loved but whose love was unattainable. Therein lies the beauty of the movie. We all want to hope that someday she and Rick maybe got together or that they spent the rest of their lives with other people but still dreaming of Paris.<br />Although I found the book an interesting read, it just didn't work.

Like the previous reviewer, I had to read this book for a class. The book gives the view of Indochina from the French perspective. Relying on novels, newspapers, movies and other items of popular culture, the author shows how French culture created an image of Indochina and dealt with their first colonial defeat.  Chapters include discussions of the French Exhibition of 1931 and the role of gender in the cultural image of Indochina and a number of fairly sophisticated historiographical arguments.  The author does a good job of summarizing each of her points which is extremely beneficial since this is not a book for the casual reader.<br />I felt that in some areas the author was stretching her points but perhaps that makes the book more provacative. My one major criticism is the constant injection of long paragraphs in French with no English translations. The previous reviewer found that aspect of the book beneficial. Perhaps he or she is bilingual and able to read the French. Most English readers are not. I felt that I lost a great deal because I was unable to read the quotations. Would it have been so hard to footnote those quotes in English since the book was published for an English speaking audience?	2002-11-30

They were ok.  However, my so/so response is probably based on the fact that detective stories are really not my genre.<br />When I got a call from a friend recommending THE IRISH SPORTS PAGES I was a bit apprehensive. My curisoity was perked when he said that he read the book in two days. When I heard the basis of the plot I became more interested and went to my local book store to fork over the cash and it was worth every cent.<br />For residents of the Cleveland area the plot will be strongly reminiscent of an incident that was widely reported in the  local press about a year ago.  The son of a county judge, who happens to be Irish, met a guy in a local Irish pub.  The stranger was posing as someone from Ireland who had lost his luggage and wallet. In the real life story the would be son of Ireland said that his father was the vice president of Waterford.  He promised trips to Ireland and vacations in the family resort in Florida. The judge's son took the great imposter home where the \\"man who came to dinner\\" made off with expensive jewelry and cash, including the judge's cuff links after accepting the judge's  hospitality for a week or so.  A local female attorney was also hoodwinked by the imposter and got scammed for the cost of several nights in a downtown hotel.<br />Knowledge of the local color, which is all green, greatly enhances the readability of the book, but even if you don't know Cleveland and it's Irish politicians, it's a great read.<br />Interestingly enough, there is not one black or latino character in the book.  The Italians, who play a part in the plot,  are all portrayed as Mafia types.  Cleveland is a really diverse city. Seems that Roberts could blend his colors from time to time and demonstrate the diversity of the city.	2002-07-25

So when I ran across Jesse Larner's book in the new book section of the library I picked it up.  The author's thesis is fascinating.  I've read a lot about the Klan in the 1920's but never ran across Gutzon Borglum's name or his connection with the klan and Mount Rushmore.<br />The book and an analysis of the thesis that the monument is an icon to white supremacy is a great asset to current historigraphy.  It's too bad that the author could not have gotten a better publisher.  The book has no index and appears to be a reprint of a paper prepared by Larner. There are no maps, no diagrams, no photographs.  Larner makes the point that Borglum looked like Teddy Roosevelt.  In this case a picture would have been worth a thousand words.<br />I found that parts of the books were a bit stretched in terms of materials added just to add to the length.  Essentially, Larner's point could have been made in a much shorter work. But for students of American History, the book is well worth reading. And my plans for a trip to Mount Rushmore have now been abandoned.	2002-07-04

So it was with spepticism that I began FLIGHTS OF LOVE. I was delighted to find that I was wrong, at least on the second point.<br />Schlink has compiled a wonderful selection of short stories with ironic twists and surprise endings.  As he does in THE READER, he deals with relationships and the web people spin for themseles in dealing with lovers and spouses.  I felt the strongest of the stories were THE OTHER MAN and THE CIRCUMCISION.  In THE CIRCUMCISION and THE GIRL AND THE LIZARD, Schlink revisits the theme of THE READER in terms of deling with Germany's past and the acceptance of it by contemporary Germans. The conflicts between the characters in THE CIRCUMCISION, while specifically dealing with German/Jewish relations are universal and could involve interracial couples as well as couples from different cultures. In THE OTHER MAN Schlink marverls the reader with his incites into the life of a grieving widower and the fact that his wife has had an affair yet maintained a healthy relationship with him.<br />I felt that THE SON was the weakest of the stories and seemed to have been drawn on themes more common to V.S. Naipaul.  I suspect that some of these stories will show up in the movies some day, especially THE OTHER MAN. All in all the stores are well done, provacative and readable. I only look forward to Schlink's next work.	2002-06-24

Well, so much for that list as a criteria for good reading.<br />I suspect that if you were on an airplane or stuck someplace with some time on your hands SUZANNE'S DIARY would be worse while.  Barring that don't bother.  The reading level must be somewhere around the 5th grade.  The story line is weak and although there is a moderate suprise at the end, I kept waiting for something to happen.  At the end of the book I felt like I had been subjected to an overdose of sugar.<br />In addition, I don't think that relationships are like the two in the book.  Matt, who is made out to be such a catch, but doesn't seem to have much of a job,  never has a harsh word or any kind of disagreement with his two loves. Now, I find that a little hard to believe. No one's relationships are that perfect.<br />Maybe a lot of people liked this book because they want to dream that such relationships exist. People always want to believe that there will be a happy ending.  I guess there are happy endings in the movies and in books like this but in life, things are hardly this perfect.<br />There's too much good stuff out there to read than bother with such romantic driffle.	2002-05-29

Starting in the 1950's, historians began using the \\"bottoms up\\" approach to history wherein they looked at the lives of individual persons  at the lower end of the tradional social order.  Traditionally historians considered the center of the society - kings, leaders, rulers - as the controlling force.  More recent historians argue that the periphery, that is the persons of what was usually called the fringes of the society, controls the center.<br />Peter Quinn ably uses this approach in his novel BANISHED CHILDREN OF EVE. In considering life in mid 19th century New York City, he explains the prejudice that existed between the Irish and the Black community on an economic level which makes it understandable. While not justifying the acts of violence, the reader comes to see the blight of the underclass.  The reader comes to identify with the overworked housemaid, petty criminal, homeless orphan and free black.  One sees the corruption in the society. The upper clas is not romanticized but shown as the oppressors.<br />The Civil War affected major changes in the lives of most Americans. Quinn shows the changes in the lives of the major characters in the book. Through the eyes of these characters the reader sees the emergence of the middle class, which was one of the major impacts of the War. There are Horatio Alger stories in the book but not in the tradtional sense.  The reader also sees the brutality of life in 19th Century society.  Death and separation from parents and realtives were a common experience. The use of alcohol was common and one can see why the Temperance Movement became so important by the end of the century. And prostitution is shown as the only way out for many women.  But some women do get out of it.<br />Students read about the brutality of slavery and as a African American and a student of African American history I am in no way trying to diminish the horrors of America's \\"peculiar institution.\\"  Slaves lacked all rights and had no freecom to lave their masters. Family members were sold and never seen again. But when you look at the lives of the working poor in New York during much of the 19th Century, there are many parallels. The horros of the middle passage are unspeakable but the horrors of many immigrant ships were terrible also.<br />Historian Nell Painter argues a theory of \\"Soul Murder.\\"  She aruges that the effects of slavery were so damaging to all of American Society, both black and white, that we are still feeling it today.  She argues that the dysfunctional families of today are the result of the violence experiences of both black and while children during the 19th century.  Her argument is interesting, but in it she fails to consider the effects on white society of such events as orphan children shipped West, the abandoned family as a result of immigration, alcoholism and death. Surely these events have long range consequences in contemporary society.  Quinn includes all of these in his marvelous book.<br />By way of criticism I thought the book was a tad long.  The story of the priest did not seem to add anything to the story and in my humble opinion could have been left out.  Some of the sub plots got a little wordy.  The point was made and the author could have moved on. I assume that Stephen Foster is used as an example of someone that falls from the upper class to the lower class whereas Bedford is a person that moves up. I'm not sure that Quinn does such a good job of wrapping up the story. In a sense the novel is kind of a look at a period of time in the lives of the characters. The reader is left to speculate as to the rest of their lives.<br />I first heard about this book when Quinn was interviewed on Public Radio. I bought it and started it and then left it on the shelf for a year or so until I saw in  a recommended section in my local book store. That caused me to start it again. Once you get about 50 pages into the book it really kicks in and is a fascinating read. I high recommend BANISHED CHILDREN OF EVE to the student of American History and those interested in the study of Irish immigration.gain.

Timothy Dumas' account of the Martha Moxley murder must be read in light of the fact that it was published in 1998 which means that the research was done at least a couple of years  prior to that time.  Now that there has been an indictment of Michael Skakel and the trial has commenced the information in the book seems a bit dated. However, it is a good source of background information.<br />I found that often the author stretched his limited materials in order to make a book length work. He includes pages of information that are not relavent to the Moxley case but do give background information about the community of Greenwich.<br />Dumas spends much of his time focusing on Tommy Skakel and Ken Littleton as key suspects. He tells of the many tragic things that happened to many of the characters but just doesn't seem to tie the story together.  The reader gets a good incite into the Greenwish and how the \\"other half\\" lives.  But all and all I found this book very shallow.	2002-05-18

She shows a side of the Depression and the world of horse trainers and jockeys that is valuable, informative and well worth reading for everyone interested in America's past.<br />For a society that assume entitledments in exchange for employement such as health care and retirement benefits and the right to join a union, the plight of the jockeys is &quot;worth the price of admission.&quot; I'm sure the expression &quot;by the seat of your pants&quot; is older than the sport of racing, but that's how jockeys lived - virtually by the seat of their pants.<br />For animal lovers the treatment and love of the horse is heartwarming.<br />This is a great book and well worth reading.  I've never been a horse racing fan but after reading SEABISCUIT I'm going to have a lot more respect of race horses and the entire sport. I only wish there were more like it.	2002-05-12

I believe that sometimes the critics feel that the time of an author has arrived and they want to reward him for his achievements. Such is probably the case in HALF A LIFE.  I have read A BEND IN THE RIVER and HALF A LIFE repeats many of the same themes.  Once again the main character is having sex with his friends wife or lover. Once again there is a man who is displaced from his culture and his family and trying to create a life for himself in a new world.  Naipaul is a fine writer and I find much of his prose beautifully written. Someday I'd love to take a class or be in a discussion group with a Naipual scholar who could trace many of his themes and characters.  But this is one book that I really can't recommend.	2002-05-12

In reading his story, people like me, who grew up with two parents in a loving home should be on their knees thanking God or who ever they believe in for their blessing. Having grown up in the same area of Cleveland as Fish, I relished in the memories of the old neighbor. But I also remember children talking at school about somebody being a &quot;welfare child&quot;. I remember knowing children who were pushed from pillar to post. But until you read Fish's story you can't imagine what life was really like for him and thousands of other children growing up in foster homes.<br />I'm sure that there are loving and caring foster homes but many are not. The State does the best that they can, but it's a tough life.  And the saddest part is the fact that at age 18 many of these children are left family-less and homeless just like Fish.<br />If there was one sin that Fish's mother committed it was her negligence in connecting him in some way with his father's family. I'm sure that she had her reasons, but it certainly would have changed his life.<br />This is really a &quot;page turner&quot; as one of the other reviewers commented.  It's not an easy book to read and there were parts that almost brought tears to my eyes. But it's a side of life that exist.<br />I'd recommend this book to middle and upper class childen who complain about their miserable blight in life.  Let them walk a mile in Fish's shoes and maybe they'll change their tune.	2002-04-28

I have read many best selling and award winning novels and found them wanting. One wonders sometimes - \\"Why did this book get an award.\\"  My question about OUT OF THE NIGHT.... is \\"Why didn't it get an award?\\" As a student of the South, this book gives an interesting look at the South of the 1950's and the changing social norms. Change is a major theme in the book and it would be interesting to discuss with a book club or with students the examples of change.  The characters are well developed, although I thought some of the black characters were not as well developed. It would be interesting to do a comparison of Aunt Nelda and Mrs. Vance. Although they appear much different, they have much in common. And likewise between John and Little Luther.  The book is magical and a wonderful read and would be excellent for a book club.  It could give rise to great discussions and the edition I have has questions included. Don't start it unless you have time to read the whole thing.  For those who liked TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD it's a must read.	2002-04-24

Grant and the Politics of War and Reconstruction, 1861-1868 (Civil War America)	Books	5	34	36	N	Y	An excellent book for the serious student of Reconstruction	As a person with some knowledge of the Civil War and Reconstruction, I found LET US HAVE PEACE extremely well written, very readable and highly informative.  However, I do not believe that it is for the casual reader.  The book deals with a very specific time and a very specific subject:  Grant's transition from general to president.  The author shows Grant's involvement in Recontruction and the peace process before the end of the war and during the Johnson administration. For example, I was unaware that Grant was secretary of war after the removal of Stanton and his role in the controvery over the Tenure in Office Act.  The book gives an interesting view of Grant's role in the impeachment of President Johnson and shows the interworking of the relationship between Grant and other generals, espcially William T. Sherman. I found the chapter on the rise of Grant as a presidential candidate extremely interesting contradicitng the general consensu that he was an shoe in for the nomination.<br />The epilogue which is historiographic in nature was very helpful in terms of putting Simpson's thesis in context.<br />Once again, for the student who already has knowledge of the cast of characters and the interworkings of the politics of Reconstruction, this is a must read. It was also refreshing to read a book on Grant that avoids references to his drinking.  As I recall there are three references in the entire book and they are well placed and put in proper context.	2002-01-21

However,  the book covers much more.  It is in fact a comprehensive history of the war with insightful profiles of the major characters of the period.  The title sounds like something a publisher picked up to make the title for intriguing.<br />This book was loaned to me by a former classmate.  As a phd candidate in American History with an fairly comprehensive background in the war and Reconstruction, I anticipated reading a book that covered very familiar ground.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  Winik does a very good job of sumarizing the final days of the war and putting them into a greater context while also providing the reader with background information. I was especially impressed with the information about the period of time between Lee's surrender and the actual secessation of the fighting.  Everyone thinks that the war ended with Lee's surrender but there is much more to tell relating to the negotiations between Sherman and Johnston.  Winik goes into some detail about the possibilities of a guerilla fighting after the close of the actual combat.  I also found the discussion of Natan Bedford Forrest interesting.  Contrary to many historians, Winik shows the Lincolns as a loving couple and as a result is much kinder to Mary Todd Lincoln than most.<br />As a graduate student, I have read many books about very specific instances in the war and reconstruction - so specific sometimes that you tend to forget the larger picture.  Winik gives an excellent overview. If I were teaching a survey course on American History I think that I would make this book required reading.	2001-12-28
US	53072584	R2HM938HK9AJLQ	0061319295	136622554	The Impending Crisis, 1848-1861	Books	5	63	79	N	Y	A Classic for Students of the Civil War	For those who studied history in the 1960's. David Potter's IMPENDING CRISES brings back memories of a time when political history dominatd the study of America's past. For students who grew up in the age of new social history, Potter's work is a unique opportunity to broaden their perspective and experience the genre of another generation. A synthesis and a commentary, the book analyzes political developments in the United States From the outbreak of the Mexican War to the firing on Fort Sumter, a period that Potter sees as vital to an understanding of the causation of the American Civil War.<br />The cast of characters is composed of white males, be their politicians or the electorate. Female names are virtually absent from the index.  Other than Dred Scott, the only other individual black person mentioned is Frederick Douglass, and it seems that Potter stretches his research to include Douglass as opposed to giving him agench.  Potter's work, completed after his death by friend and associate, Don E. Fehrenbacher, is the story of the interaction of white men who made political and sometimes moral decisions and how those decisions influenced the American people.<br />One of the significant aspects of the book is how Potter weaves the interralated events into the pattern of socail turmoil that culminated in the Civil War, often attempting to put the reader intothe mental framework of 19th century America.  Stressing slavery as the most significant contribution to the tensions leading to the war, Potter de-emphasizes the significance of Nat Turner's Rebellion and John Brown's Raid.  However, he demonstrates their importanc when viewed in combination with other events and thier impact on contemporary thought.  As Potter points out, &quot;Historians customarily write about past events as if each one occurred in isolation, neatly encapsulated in a sealed container, or chapter.&quot; (P. 177)  A work such as Potter's brings the student who has done indepth readings on events such as John Brown's Raid or Nat Turner's Rebellion into the reality of the larger spectrum of events.<br />In telling his story, Potter goes about his task ina meticulous manner, particularly when one considers the voluminous footnotes. In several instances he offers revisionist interpretations of certain characters.  He shows John Brown's Raid as a futile act, a publicity stunt by contemporary standars. He attempts to rehabilitate the image of President James Buchanan, a man most historians have not held in high regard.  He demonstrates the hypocrisy of many abolitionists and how Republicans maniputlated their platforms to win over Know Nothing and nativist voters.  Lincoln is shown as the practical politician that he was. Piercing homes in the myths that have evolved during Lincoln's early career and campaign the presidency.<br />In offering his revisionists views however, I believe that Potter goes too far in his attempt to ggive a seemingly unbiased view of Justice Roger B. Taney.  This is especially true when he states that &quot;Taney's valuable contributions to American constitutional development remained unrecognized because of the Dred Scott decision.&quot; (P.  290) Granted Taney severed longer than any chief Justice other than John Marshall.  In addition, he made favavorable contributions to America's economic development by reaching decisions that favored emerging industries.  However, his opinions in Groves v. Slaughter (1844), Prigg v. Pennsylvania (1842) and Strader v. Graham (1850) were decidely proslavery, offering no protection to free blacks or the free states that opposed slavery.<br />Regarding the Dred Scott decision, Potter says &quot;Probably no other major judicial decision in history affected the daily lives of so few people&quot; (P. 290) While conceding in th next paragraph that the decision had indirect results, it is still difficult to understand Potter's view. Taney found that Blacks were not citizens and delineated bifurcated citizenship between federal and state government which would have significant ramifications in subsequent rulings of the court.  For the first time, the Supreme Court found unconstitutional a major piece of fderal legislation. For the first time, every justice of the Supreme Court wrote an opinion on a case, a decision that takes up 248 pages of the Supreme Court Reports. Had it not been for the Civil War, the Dred Scott decision would have dictated federal policy on slavery in the territories until the nation was able to end slavery or amend the constitution and yet potter downplays its importance.  The evidence is clearl that the adoption of the 14th Amendment was an attempt by Congress to overturn the Dred Scott decision, but yet Potter feels that it did not affect the daily lives of individuals.<br />However, the emphasis of the book is on the history of political events and not legal history.  All in all every page of Potter's work is extremely worthwhile.  The discussions of the development of both political parties is &quot;worth the price of admission.&quot;citizenship between federal and state government which would have significant ramifications in subsequent rulings of the court.

US	53072584	R333S4UV0EN0CB	0029197619	737084017	Embattled Courage: The Experience of Combat in the American Civil War	Books	3	13	17	N	Y	Courage and the Civil War Soldier	The inability to unerstand the mind set and motivation of another generation is the challenge facing those who attempt to look at the past and particularly those who take a bottoms up approach to the study of history.  Gerald Linderman faces this challenge in EMBATTLE COURAGE. Primarily through the use of letters and diaries, Linderman allows the reader to probe the psychological motivation of Civil War soilders and attempts to answer the question:  what lead soldiers to fight.<br />As soldiers lost their connection to the civilian world and suffered from hunger, depravation and the cruelty of war, they abandoned earlier concepts of respect for the property of fallen comrades and opponents. Foraging gave way to looting and looting gave way to destruction of private property.  Civilians who watched as spectators during early battles and were considered separate and apart from the military effort were eventualy encompassed into the term enemy.  The discussion of civilian involvement and attacks on the civilian population reminded me of discussions during the Vitnam war of attacks by the United States military on civilian villages and the military justification that was provided.<br />Linderman admits in his introduction that he does not include the 180,000 blacks who fought in the Civil War.  He does include women through the use of letters and reflections on thier support on the home front. According to Linderman, women strongly supported te concept of courage throughout the war even after soldiers had abandoned it.  However, such statements as &quot;Women in both North and South set themselves staunchly against desertina&quot; (P. 91) seems extremely general and assumes that women were totally accepting of the hardships they were forced to endure.  This depiction of their continuing opposition to desterions during the entire war depicts women as static and unaffected by the circumstances of life while one of the themes of the book is the changes of attitude and perception that men experienced. thelong casualty lists, service in hispitals, keeping family farms and plantations operating without fathers brothers and husbands surely affected the attitudes of women regarding desertations and continuation of the war, a point that Linderman fails to consider.<br />The Civil War soldier marched off to the unknown.  He brought with him pieces ofhome, such as homemade quilts lovingly made by mothers, sisters and wives.  He also brought with him their shared dreams and social values. Like the homemade quilts, those dreams and social values were left by the side of the road early in the war.  The burden of carrying them in the face of combat and death was too heavy. The horrors of war and advances in the technology of fighting changed the soldiers and forced a separation between them and their communities, a relationship that has been open to much historical debate.  The war changed the soldiers and they also changed the nation.Gone was the innocence of an earlier age. As America experienced its second revolution, it changeld like the soldiers who fought in it.<br />Bell Irvin Wiley set the standard for the conventional wisdom on the motivation of Civil War soldiers in his 1943 and 1953 works. Based on his research, Wiley concludes that men enlisted primarily  out of ecnoomic need and because their communities pressured them. They stayed and founght largely for the sake of their friends.  James W. McPherson, takes a different view.  While not dismissing the findings of Wiley and Linderman, McPherson concludes that Union and Confederate soldiers possessed deeply held political and ideological convictions, which were the major reason they enlisted, remained in the ranks and fought.  Confederate soldiers acted largely out of the convcition that there were defending rights and liberty and Union soldiers believed that self government and thier own freedom depended upon upholding the Republic against division and anarchy.  Emphasizing duty andhonor, McPherson finds a strong reliance on obligations of duty and pride.<br />Linderman looks first at the conception of war held by American soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and then at motivation. He focuses on vlunteers of 1861 and 1862, both North and South, and shows how the values held by these soldiers and their home communities evolved, changed and eventually bifurcated under the stresses of camp life, combat, military hospitals and physical depravation as the war progressed.<br />In Lnderman's views, the core motivation of Civil War soldiers was courage.  However, courage must be seen in light of the companion viruties of manliness, Godliness, duty, honor and kinghtliness, all of which were shared with those on the home front. This concept of courage coupled with religious faith was so strong early in the war that soldiers believed that it protected them from physical harm.  And indeed it did protect them as long as both sides held the same standard. Soldiers on opposing sides sometimes withheld fire on an officer or man who demonstrated extraordinary valor in combat. This early war, as described by Linderman, was a war in which men had no respect for sharp shooters and guerila fighters and withheld fire when men were answering to the call of nature.  The cessaion of combat by virtue of an informal truce, trading between the lines and withholding firing on pickets was common.<br />Relying on the letters of literate middle class soldiers, it is interesting the speculate whether or not Linderman would have reached the same conclusions relying on the now silent voices of the generally illiterate lower classes.honor, McPherson finds a strong reliance on obligations of duty and pride. <br />Linderman looks first at the conception of war held by American soldiers and civilians during the Civil War and then at motivation.

I am a life long Clevelander and as a small child remember the newspaper articles and the discussions about the case.  As an adult and a laywer I worked in and continue to work in  court system and know many of the people in the book. And of course I am familiar with the courtrooms and locations talked about in the book. In the sense that Neff really captures the spirit of the times and the furor over the case in Cleveland I think that he does an excellent job, particularly in the background of some of the characters. He also gives a good view of the Sheppard family and lots of details on Sam, Marilyn and their relationship.  However, I have major problems with the premise that Eberling committed the murder. To believe Neff, you still have to believe that Sam Sheppard layed on the sofa while someone came in and beat his wife to death and neither he nor his son work up. You also have to believe that Sam tangled with the killer once in the house and then goes down to the beach and tangles with the same killer who is hanging around.<br />As one of the other reviewers mentioned, Eberling was a known homosexual.  Would he have sex with Marilyn and then kill her - a woman that was nice to him.  It just doesn't jive.  I felt that Neff was really stretching it when he talks about Eberling in the last chapter or so.  Talk about hearsay on hearsay...<br />When Neff spoke at a book signing he talked about how Eberling rambled on and made little sense when he talked to him. He gives Eberling a lot more credibility in the book than he described in person.<br />I always knew that Sam &quot;got around&quot; with the ladies, but after reading of his many affairs, ones that Marilyn knew about it seems hard to believe that she continued to say with him.  It was truly a strange marriage.<br />As a minor point, on page 122, Neff mentiones that former Mayor Harold Burton of Cleveland was elected to the senate and then went to the Supreme Court of the United States by virtue of appointment by FDR.  Burton was appointed by Harry Truman to the US Supreme Court.<br />All in all this book is a good read about the Sam Sheppard murder case.  He gives some good insights but he didn't convince me.  I will always believe that Sam was guilty and the book didn't convince me.  Some people say it changed their minds. Maybe it did for them but not for me.<br />And as to the law suit filed by my friend Terry Gilbert, on behalf of Sam Reeese Sheppard, the statue of limitations had run.  The case was over. Sam didn't seek any redress when he got out of jail and if there was a cause of action it belonged to Sam and died with him. How can the son come up at this late date and say that his father was wrongfully incarcerated.  This is the reason that we have statues of limitation of cases.ent by FDR.

When I found that my local library was going to have a discussion of it and after several friends raved about the book I gave it another try. It does take a little to get into it but after that I enjoyed it.<br />As I turned the pages of THE RED TENT all of a sudden I felt that Martha Ballard, the midwife made famous by Laurel Thatcher Ulrich in MIDWIFE'S TALE was coming out of the pages. Now this is not to say that Diamant plagerized someone else's story. However, I would be willing to bet that Diamant studied Ulrich's work. Both Dinah and Martha were midwives. Both books show the importance of midwives in their respective cultures. Both books how how women contributed to the economy of thier families through their weaving and other tasks. Both books show how women bonded together during the birthing process, although Diamant shows that there was a bonding during the three days in the red tent each month. In both books you can see that there was not place for single women in the society.<br />In Martha Ballard's life there is the story of a rape. Although the woman is raped, her husband is the &quot;victim&quot; becuase his rights have been violated. Much the same happens with Dinah. However, I didn't think that the author made it clear when Dinah's brothers killed her husband. At first I thought that I was the only one that missed that point but several other people had the same problem.<br />I was also confused as to how all of the women had their periods at the same time, however, I'm told that that happens when women live together - it's news to me. However, a footnote or a forward by the author about that and other historical points in the book would have helped. Also, someone in my book club mentioned that a map would have also helped.<br />All in all, it was a good read. It gives a depiction of women in bibical times that has not previously been shown.	2001-12-21

But that was what Joseph was trying to do when he took Celice to the beach that faithful day.  He was trying to recreate a time and a moment that had passed and they both paid the ultimate price. And perhaps that is the message of the book. The world around them continued, with the flies and the gulls and the insects, continued, it did not stop, even their daughter did not stop - maybe just slowed down for a brief moment.  In our memories we want to freeze a moment in time and have the ability to return to it. But that moment is gone and can never be exist again. The past lives in our hearts and we can share that with someone in a way but it can never happen again. BEING DEAD is a short novel that can be read in a couple of evening.

I saw a woman in an airport and inquired whether or not she liked it but she had not started it. For some reason I was relunctant to buy it - I must have been fore warned. Fortunately (for my wallet), I was at the library and got it out.  Most of the reviewers here ... are relunctant to give bad reviews, as I am but this book is one that does not deserve the praise that other have written about it.<br />Usually, Oprah does a good job, but she ... up on this one.  The story is a bit hard to follow because of the skipping around with the characters. The plot is somewhat predictable once you get into it. It is a quick read, but depressing is the best way that I can describe it.<br />Maybe I'm too much of a big city person to appreciate life in a small town.  Although I have one sister, we are not close. Maybe these factors play in to my decision about DROWNING RUTH, but all in all its not worth the read.	2001-04-16

There was always the slight inference that she may have been a lesbian and the stories about her possible capture by the Japanese.  I found EAST TO THE DAWN illuminating and informative. The author makes Amelia much more of a feminist and political person than I had ever imagined.  For example, I did not know about her friendship with Eleanor Roosevelt. But Amelia's friendship with Nancy Cook and Lorena Hitchock and involvment in the Val Kil project made me think that there may have been some validity to the rumors about her life style.  It's also interesting how much the government did for her on her flights. The possible capture by the Japanese seems to me looking back in retrospect that it could be a form of very suttle anti Japanese propaganda. One of the previous reviewers commented that EAST TO THE DAWN finds no fault with Amelia - she was perfect in every way.  Thinking about the book in retrospect, there is a lot of validity to that statement. But all in all the book gives a good view of women and their roles in society in the 1920's and 30's.  It also give a whole new side of Amelia.  As a result of this book I want to read more about Amelia.  The author's conclusion that Amelia became bigger in death than she may have been in life is also valid but Amelia is one of those American icons that will live on and on because she died so young and under strange circumstances.	2001-03-14

But I felt pressed to put in my two cents.<br />A couple of years ago I started Wally Lamb's other book - the one about the twin brothers and one is in the mental hospital and cut off his hand.  After 30 or 40 pages I returned it to the library feeling that the subject was just too depressing.<br />When I found &quot;She's Come Undone&quot; on audio cassette I figured I'd give it a try.  Well, frankly I wish that I had left it on the shelf.  The book is so depressing.  I'm sure that there were lots of women who had similar experiences as Dolores that probably went over the edge after reading the book. The book brings back to mind every bad experience you ever had in your life because poor Dolores had them all.  Didn't anything ever good happen to her?  Granted she had a terrible life, but she accepted all that BS from Donte all of those years; she never made amends with her father;  she didn't go to visit her grandmother; she treated people badly also.<br />This is just not a book that I would recommend.  Too depressing and too long.	2001-03-01

This is one of the underlying thems in BLUES FOR AN  ALABAMA SKY.  Three of the characters have migrated from the South. Although in many respects they have adjusted, there is still a bit of them left in the South - they still carry some of the southern experience with them.<br />In dealing with the migration, all of the characters make the point that in life &quot;you have to do what you have to do.&quot;  When faced with adversity, people will do anything to survive and in many respects all of the characters are survivors.  They survive until Leland, the recently migrated Alabaman interests their lives.<br />This is a play about dreams and hopes. Each of the characters has one and each wants to fulfill those dreams in a certain way.  To say more would be to spoil a performance. Although it starts out on a light note, the second half becomes deadly serious and deals with issues rarely dealt with in African American plays.  As I have seen before, I felt that the depection of blacks in Harlem was a little lavish. Blacks in Harlen in the 30's lived stark - people lived close together - they didn't have much money.  Perhaps the characters lived a little to well.<br />Although I thought the play was a bit long in places, which could have been the local direction, the play delivers a powerful message.	2001-02-26

I readily admit that I am a card carrying member of the Black Bourgeoisie so the characters in this book were a little foreign to me.  Terry gives a side of Black life that many people live, but not all Black people live this way.  Perhaps my problem with the book is that many people will read this book and believe that all African American men are as unfaithful and as low down as the ones that Terry shows in this book.  Has Terry ever met a decent Black man?  If so, she sure doesn't write about him.	2001-02-19

Unfortunately, the author raises the questions but in a way that makes the characters unrealistic.  My first advise to Jo (or what ever she chose to call herself) was that she should have let the dead lay dying. What happened in the past should have stayed in the past. I listened to this book on the abridged audio cassette so maybe I missed any development of Jo's relationship with her first husband.  But I felt that she &quot;kind of did him wrong.&quot;  She just got up and left one day.  Maybe the hurt she inflicted on him came back on her eventually with Daniel.  Frankly, I did not like the character of Jo.  She was just as much a liar as other characters in the book.  For an audio book it kept my interest, but I had real problems with the plot.  Do people really live this way?  And a minister's wife also?  Did Jo have any involvment with her husband's church?  From what I heard she didn't even go.  I guess you could say &quot;read it and weep&quot; but I would say a liar is a liar and judge not less you be judged.	2001-02-09
US	53072584	R150AZWLKTTN6F	067103619X	690095340	Lake News	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A good and timely story but a litttle wordy	I listened to this book on audio cassette.  The reader did an outstanding job of varying the voices.  Over all the tape was well done.  The story, as other reviewers have said, is very timely. People can be destroyed by newspaper stories.  But Lilly Blake came across as a little to fragile and slow to react.  Many of the descriptions were a bit long and added nothing to the story. How many times was she told to get a lawyer and why did she hate them so? I felt that the character of Poppy, the disabled sister of Lilly was very contrived.  Perhaps it was the voice that the reader used for her - it was cutesy to the point of being elfish.  Her position as the town operator was probably needed to carry out elements of the plot, but the phone romance was totally predictable.  Having never lived in a small town and being unfamiliar with New England, the whole thing about the protective nature of the people was interesting, but I wonder if it is still true in the 21st century.  I live a very busy life and don't have time to read novels as I have in the past so the tapes work for me.  Overall, I enjoyed the story but too many subplots may have clouded the true story and the abusive treatment of four of the characters by their parents almost got to be too much.  While one reviewer commented about Lilly's good relationship with her niece Hanna, it seems to me that Lilly was remiss in not speaking up to her sister about the verbal abuse of the child. And why did Rose treat Hanna so badly?  In listenting to the tapes it seemed to me that the end was a little long in coming and was a little too predictable.  It seemed that it took at least one tape to many to get to.  Too many cooks can spoil the broth but too many words, descriptions and subplots can also spoil a good and timely story.	2001-01-28

When the movie came out I read the reviews with great interest.  The reviews all said that the movie did not  give the full story and it's obvious that you can't cram a whole life time  and years of legal battling into a two hour movie.  When I saw the movie I  was intrigued by the story and ordered the book.  I found the book well  written, with excellent details. It tells the real story and gives the  details of the legal battle in a reable form that is understandable by any  reader.  You get to know Rubin Carter by reading this book in a way that  could never happen in the movies. It's well worth reading, although the  story itself is a sad commentary on the rights of African Americans.	2000-01-12

The publishers apparently found THE QUARRY too controversial and in deed it is.  The basic story line has been  done before - the Puddin Head Wilson theme that John Twain wrote of where a  man is raised as black but is indeed white.  Chesnutt varies the theme and  while telling the story of Donald Glover also tells the story of hypocricy  in American life.  For those who did not like Chesnutt's early stories that  relied heavily on dialect and folk tales, I would urge them to try his  later works. I recently read THE COLONEL'S DREAM which is an excellent  study of the New South.  The Quarry is an excellent view of America in the  early part of the 20th Century and perhaps today.	1999-06-28

As one of the other reviewers said, I can't even believe that  someone would publish this book and that the author would have enough nerve  to tell her story.  I'm not one to judge other people, but if she had an  affair with the married JFK then she should have enough pride to keep it to  herself.  And then her parents!  They were perfectly willing to have thier  daughter openly be seen with a much married man - please.  Don't bother  with this one.

Being somewhat of a student of Chesnutt, I enjoyed this book a great deal.  But I can also understand why publishers in the 1890's would turn it down.  In the tradition of the times, there are twists and turns in the plot.  The  book is very short and is very easy to read. I would recommend it!	1999-04-19

I don't know what kind of criteria the Booker Committe uses,  but I just didn't see this book as worthy of any kind of award.  The moral  dilemna that were suppose to develope just didn't happen.

I found some of his descriptions repetitive. He must have described the midwife &quot;type&quot; at least  six times in their sandles and baggy dresses.  I found Sybil to be an aging  hippie that did not want to get the training necessary to insure the health  of her patients. I could see using a person like Sybil for a delivery if I  had been to a doctor and had everything checked out. But her  &quot;patients&quot; used her for pre natal care. That was amazing to me.  Although Sybil was well intentioned, it my opinion she did not want to jump  through the hoops that all professionals have to go through and get the  needed training.  She certainly had a streak of bad luck the night of  Charlotte's death, but better training could have helped. I did not like  the ending although I thought that the author told the story well and mixed  memories with glimeses of the future.   And one minor point, as a judge,  there is no way that I would let someone nurse there baby in my court room.  The book is well worth reading but it left me very unsettled about midwives  with the &quot;training&quot; that Sybil had.	1999-01-18

Over the years I read the Marrow of Tradition, House Behind the Cedars and several of Chesnutt's short stories.  PAUL MARCHAND FMS is truly a lost treasure. The introduction is extremely  well done and gives an excellent explanation to new readers of this genre.  All readers will get a true sense of the racial lines that exsisted in  early 19th century New Orleans and how some of these same feelings exist  today.  If you have not been a reader of Chesnutt, this is a good place to  start. I'm sure that you will come to love his writings just as I have.

Two years ago I received a masters in history and am currently working on a PHD in American.  As an Ohio resident I have always  had an interest in our Ohio Presidents, writing my masters thesis on the  funeral of Ohio's James A. Garfield. I've also done some reading on Warren  Harding and took the time last summer to visit his home in Marion, Ohio. So  it was with great interest that I discovered FLUKE on the shelf of my local  library. In light of the Clinton situation, the story of Harding and Nan  Britton becomes even more interesting. All in all I found FLUKE very  readable.  It took a couple of pages to get used to the technique used the  author of mixing the first person of a character into the narataive, but  all in all I thought it worked very well. There are several books out on  Harding, in light of the release of some of his papers several years ago  that dispute various points made by the author. Of course the family claims  that Harding had the mumps as a child and could not get anyne pregnant.  There seems to be some validity to the argument that Harding was fairly  well known and could not have been seen in public as much as Nan Bitton  contends, but in all the author does a great job and tells a very  interesting story. I tend to believe it but this is a novel. It was not  written as the gospel. I would recommend this book highly. It's a quick  read and well done.  For what ever reason, the author left out Florence's  son who lived with the Hardings and proved to be a disappointment but other  than that its fairly close to the fact.  It's most enjoyable!!!  I just  can't figure out why he picked the name FLUKE.  In my opinion it distracts  from the novel.  The author should sell the movie rithts. It would be great  on screen - but under a different tittle.	1999-01-17

When I started this book, I did not know that it would result in a trial and that part of the book was well done. The book was well written, but I  ended it was a very unsettled feeling about Sbyil.  It just seemed to me  that she wanted to be a doctor/ nurse practioner but did not want to jump  through the hoops that it takes to get the proper medical training.  How  could she take on someone like Anne, with no training at all to be an  assistant? She wanted to do what she wanted to do but did not want to rely  on experts or authority. To me it was a reflection of her days in the  &quot;movement&quot; when she was against authority. That's not to say that  I'm against home births. But it seems to me that the women and the midwives  would want to have the mothers checked by a trained professional before  they decided to have their babies at home.  I just can't understand why a  woman would go to someone like Sibyl for pre natal treatment. Basically, I  liked the book but I just didn't like Sibyl.  The relationship with the  lawyer was kind of stretched.  If the story is true, the daughter had to  live with a lot of guilt for a lot of years. It's a book worth reading and  raises lots of issues.	1999-01-14

I liked &quot;Black and Blue&quot; but found some aspects of the story a little hard to believe.  When Fran left she had a pretty &quot;fairy tale&quot; life.  It was a little hard to believe that she could live rent free all that time and work on the almost &quot;casual&quot; level that she did. It seems that she would have been more finacially strapped. Aside from being a judge, I was also a single mother and I know from practical experience how tough it can be.  Meeting the gym teacher was a little far fetched. Trust  me, you don't meet single men with no baggage.  People in the know say that women tend to get hooked up with the same kind of guy as their ex.  But I give Fran a lot of credit. She did break free and that's what you have to do. But it was a tough decison and I don't want women to think that they will have it as easy as Fran.  Whether it's alcohol, drugs or an abusive relationship you have to make a break and look out for number one. The book is well worth reading for those who are victims of domestic violence or those who work with victims and offenders.  One of the early reviews said this was the UNCLE TOM'S CABIN of domestic violence. I wouln't go that far, but it's a quick read and very readable. It does not compare to PARADISE, which was a terrible selection.  Shame on Oprah for picking her friend's book!  I'm working on a PHD and I can't understand Toni Morrison!	1998-05-13

I found the characters believable but if the main character was so unhappy with her husband why did she stay?  Maybe she was just comfortable with him until she returned to her home town.  I am not the most moral, church going person in the world, but I really felt that if she wanted to go back to her old flame she should have shipped her daughter back to California.  Living with that jerk in front of her daugher with her long suffering husband waiting around wasn't too cool. As my summary says, you can never go home again.	1998-04-05

It was with anticipation that I undertook to read COLD MOUNTAIN last summer.  Frankly, I got bogged down with it and did not finish it until New Years. I found the book extremely slow reading. There were parts that were interesting and some good descriptions but frankly, I have not recommended the books to friends. Maybe it just wasn't my kind of book.  In my opinion, this book reflects the changing views of history.  Thirty or forty years ago Americans were reading Irving Stone - historical novels about famous people. COLD MOUNTAIN reflects the new &quot;bottoms up&quot; view of history where historians look at average people, little people to see how wars and events effected them.  In a nut shell, I think that COLD MOUTAIN could be subtitled, how the Civil War changed the lives of little people. The view of women has certainly chnaged from Scarlett O'Hara and Melanie Wilks. Ada and Ruby are hard working women, as well 19th century women were.  The book shows how tough 19th century life was, the real cruelty that existed. Babies and children died, people were not always kind to animals, war was hell.  When I completed the book, I actually thought more of it especially after I considered the changing view of history.  Seen in that light, its a signficant change from historical novels of the past and well help to eventually change people's view that everything in the past was great.	1997-12-31
