Common.  He sees others special gifts but can't see his own. He prays to God every night with his friend Wormie, \\"Why did You make us so common?\\"  God's loving reply would always be the same, \\"Don't worry. I love you both just the way you are, but I'm not finished with you yet.\\"  This is yet another great children's story by one of the best Christian authors around, Max Lucado. My daughter and I love all his books. This story reminds us that with prayer and patience, great things will happen in our lives.  All we have to do is wait. In the book of Isaiah, chapter 40, it says, \\"But those who wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.\\"  Thank goodness, God isn't finished with us yet! I praise Him for what He has done and all that He is going to do! We can keep growing and getting better and better. o8E<br /><br />Soar!	2005-07-29
US	49800011	R1FXEQ6QIHNS80	0689711093	627560840	Buffalo Woman	Books	5	8	8	N	N	"A legend telling the kinship between man and animal, and of the transfiguring power of love"	Mr. Goble is to be applauded for his engaging stories and fine, impressive illustrations. All children should own at least one of his books. I think my daughter likes Buffalo Woman best because the child, who is the main character, saves the day.<br /><br />A young hunter, waiting at a stream, sees his prey, a buffalo, slowly approaching for a drink and tightens his arrow against his bow. To his surprise, now he sees nothing but a beautiful woman and \\"he knew at once that he loved her.\\"<br /><br />She tells him she comes from Buffalo Nation and they she was sent because he had always had good feelings for her people being a good and kind man.  \\"My people wish that the love we have for each be an example to both our peoples to follow.\\"<br /><br />They marry and have a son, Calf Boy, but the hunter's people are cruel to his wife and child.  So they run away and turn back into their true form, buffalo.  The man loves them more than anything and chases after them.  He finally finds them (after they'd escaped him several times) and his son, Calf Boy, gives him some \\"tips\\" [this is what makes the story in my opinion] to help save his father from the buffalo and unite, not just his family but the entire herd and the hunters that hunt them. [Another interesting part of the story.]<br /><br />I think there's a strong underlying message in this story, not just for us to respect and protect animals but to respect and love each other. \\"Mitakuye oyasin--We are all related.\\"  o8E<br /><br />Soar!	2005-07-20

The Human Body by Miller is a wonderwork.  I am going into nursing school this August and it is a book that I have had for years.  It's very likely that it had a great influence on me wanting to become a nurse because it is so much fun to sit and look at this book of anatomy pop-ups true to life illustrations!  I am keeping it safe and planning on sharing it with my daughter when she is older to see if it can spark her interest in the medical field.  This book has to be seen to be believed.  It is definitely worth the asking price.<br /><br />Note: it is a book for adults but being pop-up, movable and unfoldable, I think it would be a great gift for aspiring future doctors, nurses, dental hygienists, dentists and any other profession that will have to take anatomy and physiogy to get their degree.

(--have since I did my first yoga vhs about five years ago though it feels like a lifetime, it's so natural for me.) This book is good for all yoga enthusiasts. Everyone will appreciate the photographs of Rodney's examples of each pose (although I think they should be larger) along with instructions of the poses and probably all who practice yoga should enjoy the conversations between Rodney and Nina Zolotow.  In the section of part three, Why We Do Yoga, Rodney shares this: \\"For me their was an immediate emotional component to the practice of yoga.  When I started practicing yoga, I felt like I was no longer ruled by my emotions.  I felt like I still had emotions--very strong emotions--in fact, I could observe them more deeply--but I felt like I was no longer controlled by them, that I actually had a sense of choice and a sense of deeper understanding because I wasn't so emotionally reactive in my life.\\"<br /><br />We shouldn't be controlled by our emotions.  I've learned this and let me tell you, it is wise and liberating.<br /><br />One more quote by Rodney...<br /><br />'I read an article in a newspaper that quoted the {} church as saying, \\"Yoga is dangerous because it clears the mind and leaves way for the devil.\\" It clears the mind and leaves way for the devil.  That's amazing to me, but in some sense, I realize people actually think that.  We've actually been trained not to think.  It's like in yoga class, people think it's about stilling the mind.  It's not about stilling the mind.  It's about following the mind.  It's really about deeply following something.  What we're doing is we're disciplining the mind so that it can continue to follow the present moment, watching things arise as they arise.  Watching thoughts arise as they arise and actually being cognizant of life as it's arising.  To really be in it--otherwise you're not living a life.  You're living an illusion of life.  You're actually disassociated from what's really going on....'<br /><br />Hmmmm.<br /><br />A worthy book to own to use to practice, appreciate and to understand yoga.  My practice is something that will be with me forever.  I realize now that it is so much a part of my life that I incorporate it into every workout routine I do, at some point! Even if I'm doing a video, I will either do yoga at the beginning or end 99% of the time! If you haven't tried yoga yet, please do! You won't regret it. You go at your own pace, and benefit and get more flexible with each effort.  It is great for your body and your mind.<br /><br />Soar!ot living a life.  You're living an illusion of life.

Tanmaya Honervogt's book is just perfect.  She invites the reader into the heart of Reiki by sharing: 1) Her path with Reiki  2) The Meaning of Reiki  3) The History of Reiki  4) The Reiki Degrees  5) The Reiki Treatments  6) Reiki in Daily Life  7) On Healing & Illness and  8) Reiki Reports [experiences.]<br /><br />There is so much color used throughout, some of the pages are in color as well as beautiful photography of nature scenes including: a tiered waterfall, a forest of trees covered in snow, the ocean at dusk, golden tree leaves in the bliss of autumn, wispy clouds with a touch of sunset pink, a powerful wave of the ocean rising high and curving over shooting out white bubbles of delight and various flower photos of different colors and types and many more exceptional photographs.  There are even some abstract photographs that are equally as breathtaking in their own right.  Also included are many helpful photos of real people giving and receiving Reiki (ray-key) and excellent coverage of what each position works on physically and mentally which is lacking in most books.  I find this particularly interesting as I am about to enter nursing school to fulfill my calling of over 10 years of God \\"tapping me on the shoulder\\" to become a nurse!<br /><br />A favorite part includes \\"Harmonizing Chakras\\" and \\"Grounding\\" of which the latter I have never read about in another Reiki book to date and the former best covered of all I've read so far.  Other useful, helpful topics I enjoyed include: \\"Reiki Emotional Problems,\\" \\"Uses for Reiki,\\" and \\"The Reiki Healing Box.\\"  There are many inspiring and exciting quotes throughout of givers and receivers of Reiki, including some testimonials in the last chapter. The entire book is a glory and blessing to the reader.  It will make you smile.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed this version of the history of Reiki and that Dr. Usui was a Christian who was asked by his students if he believed in the miracles of Christ and whether he was able to demonstrate such a healing.  This question spoke to his heart and set him off on a quest to study the healing methods of Christ.  While in a Buddhist monastery he embarked on a 21-day meditation and fast on a holy mountain near Kyoto.  And it tells his experience and his journey with Reiki. [I love the fact that Dr. Usui was a Christian because I am too and have prayed for permission from God to do Reiki and have been answered with a yes. Since it is my personal belief being a Christian that the Universal Life Force aka Reiki IS the Holy Spirit, why wouldn't God allow me to use it to touch/help/speed healing of others? This is why I am wanting to be a nurse in the first place as well as to serve Him and to show others His love and healing through prayer and Reiki!]<br /><br />Included are the Reiki Principles:<br /><br />\\"Just for today, be free and happy.<br /><br />Just for today, have joy.<br /><br />Live consciously in the moment.<br /><br />Count your blessings with gratitude.<br /><br />Honour your parents, teachers and elders.<br /><br />Earn your living honestly.<br /><br />Love your neighbor as yourself.<br /><br />Show gratitude to all living things.\\"<br /><br />\\"The word meditation and the word medicine both come from the same root.  Medicine means that which heals the physical, and meditation means that which heals the spiritual.  Both are healing powers.\\" ~Osho<br /><br />I encourage you to get attuned either locally or more affordably and I believe equally powerful or more so, through the dvds sold here at amazon by Reiki Master, Steve Murray. Shanti.  This book was one of the motivating factors for me to get attuned though it can be read before or after attunement.<br /><br />\\"Once you have found yourself, you have found your home.  You have found your love, you have found you inexhaustible ecstasy, you have found that the whole of existence is ready for you to dance, to rejoice, and to sing--to live intensively and to die blissfully.These things happen of their own accord.\\"  ~Osho.<br /><br />o8E<br /><br />Soar!n of their own accord.\\"  ~Osho. <br />o8E <br />Soar!	2005-07-02

Simple, yet beautiful text, lovely illustrations and an interesting shape of eleven inches long by seven inches wide, A Tree Is Nice is a very special book that I would recommend for all children.<br /><br />The text is very reader friendly which builds up confidence.  My daughter is a picky reader but she can read this book.  She's just finished Kindergarten and they learned the popular two and three letter words which were called \\"popcorn words.\\"  Sometimes I feel that was good and sometimes bad because often she doesn't want to R E A D other words (sounding them out.)  This is exactly where A Tree Is Nice comes in to the rescue! There aren't long, intimidating words for young readers.  It has the perfect length for my daughter so that she doesn't get frustrated and is isn't too easy or too short.<br /><br />But the best part is the moral of motivating children to be \\"tree huggers\\" by realizing how beautiful and important trees are and appreciating the fact that so many of their childhood memories have to do with trees such as climbing them, picnicing under them, fishing by them, raking their leaves and jumping into the piles, swinging high on the swing hung on them and much more.  These memories will hopefully encourage them to plant trees (planting a tree is mentioned in the book) and tell their friends so they will go plant a tree too! The only thing missing to me is the science about trees such as the fact that trees clean our air. But I believe A Tree Is Nice is a great book for teaching our children to love this earth and contribute to it by planting a tree. This book can open the door for discussions about other good things for the earth such as recycling, conserving energy and eating organic foods. o8E<br /><br />Soar!	2005-07-02

And much more info I'll need to know as a nurse.) Also, I learned \\"If a person is suffering from a particularly severe complaint, it might be wiser to avoid the problem area completely for the time being, allowing the energy to flow through from the other areas and reabalance the system in that way.\\" Unfortunately I learned this after the fact of touching the upper arm of my pastor who had rotator cuff surgery.  I had to stop because he was so tense me getting anywhere near his shoulder.  Also I should have asked first if I could do Reiki which I also learned in this book.  There is just a world of information inside! My very favorite part I will write out as it is only a paragraph on page 72 but I've used it and it is so powerful I can hardly believe it!<br /><br />\\"Using Reiki to Balance the Chakras: Sitting in a chair, place one hand on the forehead and one on the back of the neck.

The girl can find no food but an old woman tells her to cheer up and not worry, that she'll never be hungry again, and gives her a magic pot and magic words for her to \\"Never forget.\\" The girl thanks her and runs home to her mother to try it out.  She uses the magic words, \\"Boil, Little Pot, boil!\\" and the pot makes up some delicious porridge.  She and her mother eat until they are full.  They had as much as they wanted whenever they were hungry and were happy and contented.<br /><br />But..<br /><br />one day the girl went to visit friends and her mother got hungry while she was gone.  So the mother made porridge but forgot the magic words to get the pot to stop boiling.  So the pot bubbles on and on making porridge until the entire village streets are covered in the thick, yummy broth. (The illustrations of this are my daughter's favorite part of the book.) The mother realizes she must get to her daughter to get the pot to quit.  So she wades through knee-high porridge to the end of the village, finds the girl and they go back home.  The girl knows the magic words and says \\"Stop, Little Pot, stop!\\"<br /><br />But...<br /><br />the townspeople, running out with everything that they own that will hold porridge, are happy because they have enough food to feast on for days.  So the girl realizes they should have been sharing it all along and does.  Now Everyone is full and happy sharing the magic porridge.<br /><br />The story is cute with a moral of Sharing and it's good for beginning readers.  The illustrations are very well done with lots of people and houses of which my daughter and I play \\"I spy\\" with.  The color palette consists of yellow, green, orange, brown and black which are gorgeous.  I recommend this book.<br /><br />Soar!	2005-06-28

This cute story of a kitten thinking the full moon is a big bowl of milk and her wriggling, tumbling,  chasing, climbing, and leaping after it reminds me of childhood imagination, curiousity, exploration and discovery.  Kitten's First Full Moon  has a fun underlying message of encouragement to go after our dreams! Usually children love colorfully illustrated books.  Kitten's First Full Moon, done in black and white with variations of gray shades, grants it to stand out in memory as being different and enables it to receive greater attention, as it is a story that occurs at night. (So black and white makes sense.) The bold, thick black lettering on starch white paper makes it easy for a child to read with confidence.  The sentences are of varying length and the story is written so that it keeps children turning pages to find out what the kitten will do next.  The many changes of illustrations from one on a full page, to five long ones, to a two page spread with only one small picture on each and more, adds to the visual interest of KFFM.

Some ailments have only a paragraph while other more serious ailments like Depression, have longer sections including remedies of: visualization, meditation, self-hypnosis, biofeedback, flower remedies, exercise, massage, aromatherapy, reflexology, creative arts, homeopathy, healing, nutritional and dietary therapy, herbal medicine, movement therapies, light and color therapies, and hydrotherapy.<br /><br />\\"THE THERAPIES\\" includes PHYSICAL THERAPIES: Naturopathy, Nutritional therapy, Electronic devices, Herbal medicine, Massage and Aromatherapy; MOVEMENT THERAPIES: Yoga, Tai Chi and Alexander Technique; PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES: Self-hypnosis, Relaxation and Creative arts therapies; SUBTLE ENERGY THERAPIES: Acupressure, Reflexology, Homeopathy, Healing (including a favorite of mine, Reiki,) and Flower remedies; and lastly, OTHER EFFECTIVE THERAPIES: Acupuncture, Manipulation, Hypnotherapy and Counseling and psychotherapy.<br /><br />Thomas used a consultant, Peter Albright, M.D. in the writing of this book and Thomas' book is very encouraging for one to realize that WE can have a direct role in OUR health and healing and come to understand we don't have to \\"pop a pill\\" for every little ache.  In my personal experience, I've learned superior nutrition, regular exercise (including a good balance and variety), maintaining an optimistic outlook and keeping in balance my mind, body and spirit help me get healthier day by day! You can do the same. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br /><br />Soar!	2005-06-12

In the past I have suffered badly from insomnia and the anxiety that comes with it and can honestly say that this series has made an enormous difference in my life! I remember my dreams, I enjoy them very much and can become lucid. I'm still working on becoming more lucid by remembering to ask myself many times daily, \\"Am I dreaming?\\" (as Victoria states in her cd about lucid dreaming.)  I dream of flying very often, have my entire life, and now, thanks to these cds, I always become lucid during flying and am able to thoroughly enjoy these times of flight.  Matter of fact, just last night I dreamed of flying and remember I started to fall a bit and instantly became lucid and \\"changed it\\" into something similiar to the magic carpet ride in Disney's Aladdin movie! I enjoyed the downward spiral dips as I soared up all the higher afterwards. Wow, that was an amazing dream! Also, I have the \\"Dream Temple\\" that I created on the Dream Recognition part of the cds that I return to often in self-hypnosis/relaxation and in my dreams! It's a beautiful white mansion on the highest mountain overlooking a dazzling, bluest blue ocean with the mightiest waves crashing on the cliffs below. This place surely exists somewhere.  The best part for me was this one particular night I dared to speak of what I wished to dream the most, and I dreamed it all night long.  I woke up and wrote down all the adventures that occurred on paper but it is so vivid in my memory, even now as I speak, that it feels like it actually happened.  For this one night of dreaming, it was worth the price of the entire program.<br /><br />I recommend this highly for those who wish to tap into the power of their subconscious minds to learn how to: recall their dreams, dream creatively in order to solve problems in their lives, to begin to dream lucidly and also for those who suffer from insomnia to become relaxed so deeply that you can and will fall asleep! I admit, sometimes I would just use this cd to fall asleep to as Victoria's voice is so peaceful that you get deeper and deeper relaxed with each breath you take listening.  Her voice portrays a very optimistic, kind, and pleasant lady and I hope that you enjoy this series and gain as much from it as I have! She also sells many other cds at her website which specifically address insomnia.  I know what it is like and so wish to encourage those who have sleep problems to seek out help until you are sleeping better! o8E<br /><br />Soar!sometimes I would just use this cd to fall asleep to as Victoria's voice is so peaceful that you get deeper and deeper relaxed with each breath you take listening.

In a world obsessed with all things Princess this book should be very well received and appreciated by girls everywhere.  A terrific story about the feisty, intelligent Princess Elizabeth who treks to save her prince from the nasty dragon only to be received with no appreciation but judgment, The Paper Bag Princess shows girls that they should be respected and appreciated for their inner beauty and strengths including determination, courage, heart and wit and not solely on their outward appearance. This book should be in every girl's library right in the middle of all her fairytale princess books.  A little dose of reality is good because a girl needs to know early in life that not all relationships are worth staying in. A woman should give and receive love, respect and appreciation in order for a healthy, satisfying relationship to exist.

Reiki Energy Medicine is a motivator to learn Reiki, which is a Great thing because I can honestly say from my own personal experience, now that I have received attunement, that it WORKS.  The authors write with the \\"Spirit\\" which just corroborates to me that Reiki is Holy and altogether Powerful.  I am a Christian and love and celebrate Jesus every day of my life.  Furthermore I have always been a woman of prayer.  Reiki brings my faith full circle because it is tangible proof to my heart and soul that God's unconditional love can heal you if you will receive it. What is so awesome about Reiki is that it works regardless of your beliefs! No religious belief is required to receive Reiki healing.<br /><br />One of the best things about Reiki that I learned from this book is that \\"The Reiki process hightlights the truth about healing: that the power and the responsibility for healing lie within the individual.  The Reiki practitioner brings intention and commitment to the process, acting as a compassionate conduit for the universal life force, but the practitioner does not DO the healing for the client.  The healing happens as a result of the relationship between the receiver's energy field and the universal energy field, mediated through the cellular consciousness of the receiver.  Reiki enpowers the receiver to do the healing that needs to be done on all levels of being.\\"<br /><br />The chapters included are: 1 Universal Life Force: The Fundamental Principle of Health, 2 The Unique Power of Reiki, 3 Self-Reiki: Caring for the Caregiver, 4 A Progressive Approach to Wellness, 5 Visions for the Future: Reiki and the Partnership Model of Care.  Also included are appendixes with diagrams for self treatment and treatment upon others.<br /><br />Important note: You really need to look into this book but I would recommend getting an attunement first of which are available at amazon in the form of vhs and dvds.  Then you can add to what you've already learned, thus fully enjoy and understand this book.  The information here is NOT going to teach you Reiki if you first haven't been attuned.  I give this book five stars because it mentions this fact in the text early on.<br /><br />Closing quote: \\"Reiki meets us where we are and gently moves us forward, providing support for doing the work we were born to do.

I've never seen anything like this anywhere, surely the artist has a style all his own.  I won't retell the story but want to also point out that the pictures actually tell the story without even reading the words.  My daughter is only six and I read her the story and asked her questions as I read to see if she could predict what would happen next (she uses picture clues.)  She answered the questions correctly.<br /><br />Most of the pages backgrounds are white which is usually \\"against the rules\\" but I believe it was for dramatic effect for the blackness on the few pages that deal with the thunderstorm part of the story.<br /><br />The moral of story of THE GIRL WHO LOVED WILD HORSES shows us that if we pursue what we truly love long enough and with all our heart we will achieve it. Truly an inspiration, this exceptional book was the winner of the Caldecott Medal for 1979.<br /><br />Soar!	2005-05-31

My daughter is crazy about butterflies and learning about them. I've always loved them too so we are having fun reading about them. We have read many library books about butterflies and this is one of the best.  Beautifully illustrated and informative, the book has fourteen, two-page sections plus a glossary and index.  An alluring feature that should be in every book to test/improve reading comprehension is a review called \\"Life of a Butterfly\\" that uses a picture along with a word or group of words for children to remember the main point of each section they read.  If they don't know the answer, they can go back to the appropriate section to find out.<br /><br />Here are the contents along with a brief summary of each section:<br /><br />1  WHAT IS A BUTTERFLY? (Butterflies are insects.  The wings have patterns made of colored scales the size of dust.)<br /><br />2  BUTTERFLY OR MOTH? (Butterflies fly during day, have long thin feelers, are brightly-colored and close their wings when resting. Most moths fly at night, have hairlike or feathery feelers, thicker hairy bodies, and cannot close their wings.)<br /><br />3  HIBERNATION (Some butterflies sleep during the winter in a safe place for up to six months. Other butterflies hibernate in a shell-like chrysalis, and some fly to warmer areas.)<br /><br />4  MATING (Butterflies feed on nectar of flowers.  When you see them, you know spring is here at last.  After a few weeks, they are ready to mate.)<br /><br />5  THE EGGS (Laid on underside of leaves or are scattered as they fly, hundreds are laid and eggs may hatch in a few days.)<br /><br />6  THE EGGS HATCH (The caterpillars eat their way out of the tops of their eggs.  They have eight pairs of legs, no wings, and large jaws for eating leaves.)<br /><br />7  GROWING UP (Caterpillars grow quickly so they have to shed their old skin which is called molting.  When the caterpillar sheds its skin for the last time it becomes a pupa enclosed in a chrysalis.)<br /><br />8  THE CHRYSALIS (Hangs upside down to a plant.  Metamorphosis occurs.)<br /><br />9  A NEW BUTTERFLY  (The chrysalis opens in about two weeks.  The butterfly emerges and crawls up onto the empty chrysalis to dry.  After one hour the wings dry and the butterfly is ready to fly for the first time.)<br /><br />10  FEEDING  (Butterflies have a special long tongue [probiscus] for sucking up nectar.)<br /><br />11  ESCAPING FROM DANGER (Butterflies are often eaten by birds. The peacock butterfly has patterns on its wings that look like eyes.  They eye patterns look like the eyes of an owl which frightens away birds.  The underside of the butterfly's wings are dark which looks like a dead leaf which are good for hiding on tree bark.)<br /><br />12  HELPING BUTTERFLIES (You can help butterflies by growing plenty of flowering plants in your yard they can feed on.

It places the child \\"in the driver's seat\\" quite literally.  They are asked by the bus driver to watch the bus for him as he reminds them before he goes to remember: Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus! On the next page you see him walking away on the left page and on the right page you see the pigeon's head sticking out to make sure he is gone before asking the child who is now \\"in charge\\" if he can drive the bus.  The illustrations of the expressions and antics of the pigeon's face as he tries to talk his way into driving the bus makes the readers and listeners both laugh out loud! My daughter loves to say no to the pigeon over and over again. And she also loves being (reading for) the pigeon. We are doing a summer reading program and I ask her to bring me usually at least two books a day and over half the time this book is one of them! She wants to hear it/read it over and over.  This is a sure sign of a winner! And that it is.  From the back cover, \\"Mo Willems is the five-time Emmy Award-winning writer and animator for Sesame Street and the creator of Cartoon Network's Sheep in the Big City.

What a delightful book he's accomplished here of a happy old man named Crinkleroot who loves to explore the forest for butterflies and moths to tell us all about. It's as if he is our grandfather and we are there with him to romp along! Of all the butterfly books I've come across and could only buy one for my daughter, this would (will) be it because of the personal approach included in the adventurous, fun-loving story. Adults and children alike want to \\"follow\\" Mr. Crinkleroot along on the \\"journey.\\" If more books were written in this way I think children would enjoy reading more.<br /><br />Here's a short sample from the beginning, \\"Hello.  My name is Crinkleroot.  I was born in a tree and raised by bees! I can speak caterpillar, moth, and butterfly, all at the same time.  And I know every wild critter in the great outdoors! Here on my hat is my friend snake.  I call her Sassafrass.  We're going to the wood's edge to look for butterflies.  You can come too.\\"<br /><br />On the next page he continues talking to us the readers.  As he puts a hand to his head to look he says, \\"Butterflies and their close relatives, moths, are among the most numerous of all insects.  Hmm...Where could they be? This meadow is usually all aflutter with butterflies.\\"  And in the picture, they are all flying behind him and Sassafrass, who is riding on his hat, turns around smiling at them.

I read this book as a way to learn to address this issue before it gets out of hand and I've learned so much! To use the five love languages (words of affirmation, physical touch, acts of service, gifts and quality time) to keep her emotional love tank full.  The book states that when a child's love tank is full, your discipline will be more readily received.  Also the way I discipline now has improved: first I make her feel loved by speaking her primary love language, then stay calm (being an example of anger managed) and explain what she did wrong and what the discipline is (always keeping it fair to the \\"crime\\") and then giving her her primary love language again at the end.  I learned that I am doing many things right especially allowing and really listening to her express her verbal anger.  This is actually good because if you don't allow children to do that they will just bottle it up inside and you can't train them plus the anger may come out as passive-aggresive behavior and more.  Ideally this book would be great to read while your children are young but it makes the excellent point that it is never too late to start changing how you treat your children, even if they are grown. I highly and whole-heartedly recommend this book to parents, teachers, aunts, uncles--all adults who have dealings with children.  You will learn a great deal that can make the people you love in your life truly feel loved by you which will open them up to become happy and mature adults. Also there is a chapter about speaking the love languages in marriage which is helpful. \\"Someone has said, 'The best way to love your children is to love their mother [father.]' That's true.\\" There's another whole book on The Five Love Languages--How to Express Heartfelt Love and Commitment to your Mate.

The NET is basically 50% math and 50% reading so this is very important.

Below are pros and cons to the system in my opinion for those considering purchasing.<br /><br />PROS: There is no doubt that Victoria Wizell is a Master Hypnotherapist.  She presents herself professionally and her voice is very pleasant to listen to.  You will likely feel  instantly you have that weight loss buddy you've always wanted right by your side.  Her hypnosis techniques/visualizations are so extremely pleasurable and vivid for me that I'd give her technique five stars. I can tell you that most of these cds work as I would find myself, after listening to \\"Hunger Scale,\\" asking myself, just as she had told me to, \\"What do I really want?\\" and questioning whether I was really hungry.  This is great because I think most people today eat on the run and don't always check to see if they are really hungry.  Food is always available so it is a great habit to get into waiting until you are hungry but not starving before you eat.  Also, I must thank Ms. Wizell because when I first started this program it was difficult for me to lay still and relax and clear my mind of things I needed to do and just focus on my time.  I have become a more relaxed, focused and balanced person listening to her guided relaxation/beautiful and powerful visualization techniques to entering hypnotic trance.<br /><br />CONS: I feel that for me, the system is too long. Twelve thirty-minute sessions that I listen to for one entire week each? What if I'd spent that amount of time exercising? Would I have had better results? I have wondered that. I did complete, as directed, the entire system, listening to each cd for one week and am now, for over four weeks relistening to the ones I feel I need some extra help on. So I'll likely eventually get the results I want. Also I feel I should share one of my biggest disappointments. We are asked to set a goal at the beginning around the same time we do our affirmation poster (which was very fun and helpful by the way) but the goal that we set isn't brought up by Ms. Wizell except that one time!  So if you, like me, forget that you set a goal, you aren't as likely to achieve it.  I feel that I would have achieved my goal IF Ms. Wizell would have reminded me at some point of Every hypnosis session, with a word of encouragement such as, \\"Go for it!\\"  But my biggest complaint is the twelfth and final cd which I was hoping would be all I would ever need to listen to again being a cumulative cd of all the weeks I'd spent. It is a review of  all the others but in a vague way so it isn't as helpful as I'd hoped.<br /><br />FINAL:<br />All in all, UWLPP is a great investment to own and listen to regularly throughout your life to keep your mind in tune with your body's needs of: eating healthy and only when you are moderately hungry (not starved) and stopping before you are stuffed; enjoying exercise, drinking water regularly throughout your day, using the swish technique to replace bad habits with healthy new ones and many more useful techniques to achieve your weight loss goals.  Good luck, everyone!  I believe consistency is the key.  Focus on the positive healthy things you can do for your body every day and not just the scale.  By making your healthy habits a lifestyle change, the pounds will drop off naturally.<br /><br />Soar!on poster (which was very fun and helpful by the way) but the goal that we set isn't brought up by Ms. Wizell except that one time!

What a terrific idea to write a book explaining these fruits in more detail and how to achieve and apply them in your life.<br /><br />Below are the chapter titles followed by some of my favorite quotes by Joyce (some paraphrasing) I'd like to remember and share:<br /><br />LOVE--YOU HAVE IT IN YOU<br /><br />*Receive God's love, then give it away.<br /><br />*Love is action.<br /><br />*Concentrate on loving people, and all the other fruit will come.<br /><br />*To abound in love is the most excellent thing we can do.<br /><br />FAITHFULNESS--NEVER GIVING UP<br /><br />*The way to grow is to stick with something.<br /><br />*To be faithful, we cannot let ourselves be led by feelings.<br /><br />*Appreciate the faithful people in your life.<br /><br />GOODNESS--GOING ABOUT DOING GOOD<br /><br />*Demonstrating love starts with a simple act of goodness.<br /><br />*Being good to others is spiritual warfare against Satan.<br /><br />*We must be good to one another and get our minds off ourselves.<br /><br />*We serve a God Who is so good.  He even takes what the devil meant for harm and works something for good.<br /><br />PATIENCE--LACKING NOTHING<br /><br />*Patience is not waiting; it is how we act while we are waiting.<br /><br />*The best definition of \\"patience\\" I have heard is to be constant or the same all the time, no matter what is going on.  That's my goal as a believer.<br /><br />*Prove you trust God by enjoying the right-now life that He has given you.<br /><br />*Possess your soul. If you don't learn to possess your soul, then it will possess you.  So many people let their emotions rule their lives.  That was a breakthrough for me when I stopped being ruled by my emotions.<br /><br />*God's ways, God's time.<br /><br />KINDNESS--EASY TO GET ALONG WITH<br /><br />*Kindness should be extended to people because they don't deserve it; otherwise, it is not kindness.<br /><br />*If you don't receive the love of God and love yourself in a balanced way, how can that love flow through you to anybody else? If you don't receive the mercy of God when you make mistakes, you don't have a reservoir to give out from whenever you need to give to mercy away.<br /><br />*Colossians 3:12 says we should have behavior full of mercy.  God mightily uses people who are meek, patient and kind.<br /><br />*Kindness will cause you to slow down and give people some time... Life was not meant to live at the fast pace that we live at.  If you go to a foreign country, the pace slows down unbelievably...In some of these other countries, they become offended if you don't take the time to fellowship.  They don't want any of this hurry stuff.<br /><br />PEACE--KEEPING IT<br /><br />*Jesus had peace, a special kind of peace, and He told us in John 14:27, Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you.  Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.  [This is one of my all-time favorite scriptures.]<br /><br />*Peace is more valuable than things. Nothing is worth anything if you don't have peace.<br /><br />*Put God first. (Mt. 6:33.)<br /><br />*Make it a priority to remain in peace.<br /><br />*We can refuse to let negative emotions steal our peace.<br /><br />*A sure way to lose your peace is to be fretful and anxious. (See Phillipians 4:6,7.)<br /><br />*Don't allow strife to be a part of our relationships.<br /><br />HUMILITY--STRENGTH UNDER CONTROL<br /><br />*What is humility? The opposite of pride.  What is pride? Something God hates.<br /><br />*Pride will destroy you.<br /><br />*Did you know that me, myself and I are the greatest problems that we have?<br /><br />*Spritual pride is the worst.  Never be afraid to ask God for help.  (See John 15:5.)<br /><br />*Compassion doesn't come by osmosis.  It comes by going throughthings.  Going through personal pain helps us empathize and be more gentle and understanding of others.<br /><br />*Humility comes before honor.<br /><br />JOY--YOU CAN HANDLE ANYTHING WHEN YOU HAVE THIS<br /><br />*The joy of Jesus has nothing to do with circumstances.<br /><br />*Joy and peace are found in believing.<br /><br />*John 10:10--The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill and to destroy.  I have come that they may have life, and they may have it more abundantly.<br /><br />*Stay focused on the good things in life.<br /><br />*There's nothing negative about God.  Amos 3:3 says, Can two walk together, except they be agreed? In order to walk with God we must come in agreement with Him.  God says He loves you so you need to say He loves you.  God says you have worth and value,.  You need to say you have worth and value...<br /><br />*Today is the day to go forward.  Remember joy can override all your discouragements and disappointments in life.  Jesus gave us His joy, and the joy of the Lord is our strength.  All it takes is a decision.  Choose joy!<br /><br />SELF-CONTROL--MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICES<br /><br />*To experience victory, make decisions to do what you know you should do.<br /><br />*Colossians 3:23 says, Whatever may be your task, work at it heartily as for the Lord and not for men.<br /><br />*Self-control takes a decision to set your mind and keep it set.<br /><br />*Stay focused.<br /><br />I love listening to Joyce Meyer on television.  She preaches about practical topics that are needed that anyone can apply to his/her life for the good.  She is very interesting, entertaining and funny.  This book is very good, but I feel it needs a lot of editing throughout. The entire first six chapters I think could be deleted and make the book better.  Chapter Seven begins with Love and for me, it is chapter one.  The introduction and conclusion are terrific.

Last library visit my daughter chose MAMA CAT HAS THREE KITTENS.  One night recently she came to me and said, \\"Mommy, I want to read you this book.\\"  I remember thinking this would be cute because she'd never said that to me before. Opening the book and pointing to the words she READ the book to me! I couldn't believe it.  I had only read it to her maybe five times.  I called for Daddy to come, ran to get the camcorder and recorded her reading it again.  Later, he said he had read it to her some too. Still, she WOWED me.<br /><br />This a fantastic book by Mrs. Fleming and it appears that all of hers are, judging by the feedback here at Amazon.  Her illustration style is unique--\\"she pours colored cotton pulp through hand-cut stencils which become the images set in handmade paper.\\" The effect is very bright, vivid and dramatic.  The active story follows a busy, frolicking day in the sun of Mama Cat and her three kittens--Fluffy, Skinny, and Boris the napper. It's a FUN story and even includes little surprises to find on EACH page. (There are three identical objects as well as a hidden mama mouse.)<br /><br />Besides all these features, the BEST PART in my opinion, is the frequent use of the same words which helps build listening skills, perhaps some memorization skills and plenty of Confidence for a beginning reader to BEGIN READING! I am going to look into some more of her books next library visit for sure.<br /><br />Soar!	2004-08-31

Without God, we can't do it.  Without us, God won't do it.  God wants us to desire to be with Him.  There is no love relationship if one person has to dictate how the other must think, feel, and act.\\"<br /><br />Reading this book was a pleasure.  Stormie shared so deeply her thoughts and feelings that I felt like I knew her early on.  She definitely has a heart for God and radiates true Joy.  And what is a better tool to help others besides sharing our own life experiences? Her examples based on her experiences illustrate her points very well.  This book would be great for someone wanting to know about what Jesus wants to do for you and to help guide you into the privilege of prayer.  It is also a good reminder to Christians of a faith walk that loves God and pleases Him by wanting and praying His will in our lives.<br /><br />Some of my favorite chapters are: \\"Praying to Know God as The Holy Spirit, Praying to Know God as Lord Over Every Area of Your Life, Praying to Know the Power of Prayer, Praying to Remain Separate From the World, Praying to Have Fellowship With Other Believers and Praying to Be Able to Walk in Faith.\\"  Also I love the four charts she does throughout the book such as \\"Fifteen Reasons to Read the Bible Daily,\\" complete with Bible verses, as well as the sections at the end of each short chapter: \\"Tools of Truth\\" and \\"Prayer.\\"<br /><br />Here are a few quotes/points that I wish to remember and share:<br /><br />\\"God, if You have a will for my life,\\" I said, \\"I need to know what it is and what to do about it.\\"<br /><br />\\"God, tell me what to do.  Show me what steps to take.  Guide me where I need to go.\\"<br /><br />\\"All of us need to acknowledge God, recognize that He is on our side, and let Him be Lord over our lives.\\"<br /><br />\\"Let go of guilt by finally accepting the Lord's forgiveness. Then move on.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Bible says, \\"I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgments and do them\\" (Ez. 36:27). The Holy spirit works the wholeness of God into us.  And there is no need to fear or mystery about this, because we alone of God's creation have a special place built in us where His Spirit can reside.  That place will always be empty until it is filled with Him.\\"<br /><br />\\"The happiest people I know put all of their lives into God's hands, knowing that wherever He is enthroned, no threat of hell can succeed against them.\\"<br /><br />\\"Our enemy is Satan, the ruler of this world, who was originally created beautiful, wise, and without sin.  He had access to the throne of God, but fell from this high position when he chose to exert his will over God's.  No one tempted him; he decided to rebel on his own.  When his rebellion led to his expulsion from God's kingdom, he set himself to oppose all that God is and does.  But Satan is limited.  He cannot be everywhere, he is not able to do everything, he is not all-powerful, and he is not all knowing.  God, on the other hand is all of those things.  What Satan and God do have in common is that they both have a plan for our lives, which can only be made operative if we submit to it.  We don't have to fear Satan because the Bible says that \\"He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world\\" (I John 4:4).  There is no indication in the Bible that Satan can possibly win over God; God's power far surpasses his.  The only success Satan can have comes through deception--getting us to believe he doesn't exist or that he is not our enemy, or instilling in us lies about ourselves, our situations, others, him, or God.  Once we believe his lies, he controls our lives.\\"<br /><br />\\"Faith is a first a decision, then an exercise in obedience, then a gift from God as it is multiplied.\\"<br /><br />The Bible says, \\"Without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him\\" (Heb. 11:6).<br /><br />Seek Him, my friend.  You will find Him, and you will be rewarded! o8E<br /><br />Soar!r /> <br />Seek Him, my friend.  You will find Him, and you will be rewarded! o8E <br />Soar! <br /> <br />	2004-08-09

This is one of the most interesting, captivating books I've EVER read.  While reading, I felt something inside me literally light up and radiate throughout my entire being.  It was like my spirit was not just nodding and smiling but speaking, \\"Finally, she's reading this. Yes!\\" I trust my instincts and immediately I knew that there was truth and wisdom here to find and apply to my life for Good.  Numerous times while reading, I paused and pondered in a meditative manner to allow this familiar knowledge to sink deep inside me.  I wished it to stay with me forever.  And it has.  THE POWER OF NOW is a book I believe everyone in this fast-paced, stressed-out world should not only read but add to their library.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Some quotes I wish to remember and share:<br /><br />\\"In essence there is and always has been only ONE spiritual teaching, although it comes in many forms.\\"<br /><br />\\"When you are present, when your attention is fully and intensely in the Now, Being can be felt, but it can never be understood mentally.\\"<br /><br />\\"...You are not the possessing entity--the thinker.  Knowing this enables you to observe the entity.  The moment you start watching the thinker, a higher level of conciousness becomes activated...when you listen to that voice, listen to it impartially...the thought then loses its power over you and quickly subsides.\\"<br /><br />\\"Enlightenment means rising above thought...all true artists, whether they know it or not, create from a place of no-mind, from inner stillness.  The mind then gives form to the creative impulse or insight.  Even the great scientists have reported that their creative breakthroughs came at a time of mental quietude.\\"<br /><br />\\"An emotion has an overpowering electric charge.  It wants to take you over and it usually succeeds--unless there is enough presence in you.  Emotion literally means 'disturbance'.\\"<br /><br />\\"If you are able to stay alert and present at that time and watch whatever you feel within rather than being taken over by it, it affords opportunity for the most powerful spiritual practice, and a rapid transmutation of all past pain becomes possible.\\"<br /><br />\\"As soon as you honor the present moment, all unhappiness and struggle dissolve, and life begins to flow with joy and ease.  When you act out of present-moment awareness, whatever you do becomes imbued with a sense of quality, care, and love--even the most simple action.\\"<br /><br />\\"Wherever you are, be there totally.\\"<br /><br />\\"Surrender is not weakness; there is great strength in it.\\"<br /><br />\\"Die to the past every moment.

All they had to do was ask for water. \\"Tobias would talk to the people about their lives.

Elzevir began judging as who deserved to get the water.  Obviously, soon no one was good enough, and the people were greatly discouraged and would rather die of thirst than go to him because they couldn't please him.<br />I love how Max uses symbolism in his stories to the Bible.  Tobias is God, Julian is Jesus, Elzevir can be seen as the devil, the people are us, and the water is Life.  I'm thankful that Jesus, I mean, Julian, (heh) came back and gave water to everyone, including Elzevir, even against the crowd's cries of \\"No water for Elzevir, he was cruel to us!\\"<br />\\"I know he was.

So this dreamer inquires about the sea to his grandmother, father, uncle, and finally to a seagull.  Each informs him about his dream, the sea.  The sea is: \\"Wild and quiet, a bit of both.\\" says the grandmother.  \\"Blue and wide, never ending.\\" replies his father.  \\"Dark and salty, like cider vinegar.\\" answers the uncle.  \\"The sea is too far,\\" answers the Seagull when the rabbit asked him to take him to the sea.  Oh, how the rabbit longed for the sea even more than before.  So he kept dreaming... one day, he had another long-awaited visit from the seagull who had something to share...<br />Read the book and find out the ending.  It may not be as you think.

Using food as medicine gives [you] the greatest chance of all to heal....What you eat can either prevent cancer and other chronic illnesses or help cause them....My number one recommendation is to eat a rainbow of fresh fruits and vegetables every day.&quot; Dharma Singh Khalsa, M.D.<br />FOOD AS MEDICINE is a must-read for all, particularly those who dislike fruits and/or vegetables but want to be healthy and prevent diseases because the doctor explains clearly and succinctly what each food can do for your body. He also has a chapter about each common illness and what he recommends eating to overcome the illness. He reminds us that by cutting down on total calories consumed while eating nutritionally dense food, we can increase our life span by as much as thirty percent.<br />Dr. Khalsa writes a chapter about each of his seven principles of yoga nutritional therapy to help you restore balance to your body, mind and soul.  They are:<br />1 Detoxify your body. (If fasting isn't for you, you can take  two 450 mg aloe vera tablets at night or go on a monodiet.)<br />2 Go organic. (&quot;The switch to organic food is vital if we are to save our environment.&quot;)<br />3 Limit or eliminate genetically engineered foods. (Examples include: aspartame, canola, corn, cotton, crook-necked yellow squash, dairy products, papaya, potatoes, soybeans, and tomatoes.)<br />4 Eat clean protein. (Buffalo, rabbit, ostrich, and venison are some non-traditional sources.  I personally enjoy the latter very much.  Choose chicken and fish--preferably wild salmon or other oily fish.

I have always wanted to visit National Parks someday--and divers places worldwide and this book confirms my dream and that I will make it happen! Every single page is full of breathtakingly gorgeous, striking photography by not just true professionals but true artists which impress me more than any photos I've seen in a long time.  The helpful 'reviews' about each, written adeptly by various writers who not only personally visit the park but share some of the history about each and much more is very interesting, informative and helpful reading.  Usually for me, when I gape and gander through a book of photography of this quality and magnitude with three-page foldouts, the writing is boring but this is terrific! On each page the state is included beside the page number.  Well- organized, well-written, flawless photography--the Perfect book.  You will never get photographs this good even if you visited all the parks.  That is all the reason you need to buy it now!<P>Here is a list of the parks: (* I must see)<BR>THE EAST: Acadia, Shenandoah*, Great Smoky Mountains (I've seen), Biscayne, Everglades*.<BR>THE MIDWEST: Mammoth Cave, Hot Springs, Voyagers, Isle Royale*, Theodore Roosevelt, Badlands, Wind Cave.<BR>THE SOUTHWEST: Big Bend*, Guadalupe Mountains, Carlsbad Caverns, Petrified Forest*, Saguaro, Grand Canyon*, Zion, Bryce Canyon*, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Arches*, Mesa Verde*. <BR>THE ROCKIES: Great Basin, Rocky Mountain (I've seen), Grand Teton, Yellowstone*, Waterton/Glacier, North Cascades.<BR>ALASKA: Wrangell-St. Elias, Glacier Bay, Denali*, Kenai Fjords*, Lake Clark*, Gates of the Artic, Katmai, Kobuk Valley*.<BR>THE WEST: Channel Islands*, Death Valley*, Yosemite* (WBHW!

US	49800011	R9AOO3HHZE31T	0810928914	235296040	The Pre-Raphaelites: Romance and Realism (Abrams Discoveries)	Books	5	12	19	N	N	&quot;A movement in which modernity and the past...	were so intimately linked.&quot;<br />Do you have a poet's heart? Or do you consider yourself a hopeless romantic? Maybe you love great quotes and succinct information in a easy to carry and store, thin paperback? Perhaps you love gorgeous, contrasting colors full of light and shadows in passionately rendered yet solemn but oh so expressive and thought-provoking symbolism with an occasional illusionist effect (as in Waterhouse's &quot;The Lady of Shallot&quot; and Millias' &quot;Ophelia&quot;) in your art then welcome to the Pre-Raphaelite movement! There is plenty of all of the above and more included in the wonderful, lightweight, colorful, informative art book!<br />This group (P. R. B. aka Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood) was dominated by three artists: John Everett Millias (1829-96), William Holman Hunt (1828-1910) and Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828-82.) &quot;The Pre-Raphelites wanted to represent modern life realistically, whether they approved or disapproved of it.&quot; Hmmm. Isn't that something that art must consist of to Be Art?!<br />&quot;Go to Nature in all singleness of heart, and walk with her laboriously and trustingly, having no other thought but how best to penetrate her meaning, and remember her instruction, rejecting nothing, selecting nothing and scorning nothing; believing all things to be right and good, and rejoicing always in the truth.&quot;<br />John Ruskin 'Modern Painters', Vol 1, 1843. [Love it! I'll take a bottle of wine from 1843 please!]<br />I believe that an artist has a gift from God. Combined with  free will, it becomes a reflection of the portion of God in him/her that wants and desires to be expressed, all through the artist's unique views from the heart.  The work of an artist communicates, often on a much more proficient and profound level than words can ever say; the artist speaks without words and the viewer has the honor of deciding on his/her own interpretation, application and inspiration to his/her life--THIS is why I Love Art so much. Truly Art is one of the highest forms of sharing. So if you are an artist, past or present, thank you and Godspeed. o8E  I would love to be an artist someday.  And I see myself giving it a go again someday, if just as a hobby. Perhaps someday I'll be found by a kindred spirit working on a canvas on the beach while taking breaks doing Tai Chi and yoga. ^_^<br />In closing, I believe the key to getting the most from art is to look at it with an open mind and ponder the message that enters your heart.  The Pre-Raphaelites do just that, touch my heart. And I enjoy pondering with an open mind!<br />&quot;I mean by a picture a beautiful, romantic dream of something that never was, never will be--in a light better than any other light that ever shone--in a land no one can define or remember, only desire.&quot;<br />Edward Burne-Jones, head of the second generation of Pre-Raphaelites, along with Morris. [Wow, I really love this quote. The quotes and illustrations of paintings alone are worth the price of this book. Highly recommended!]<br />Some of the plates for your information as well as some of my favorites: (I love all of them but *** is the highest)<br />The Eve of St. Agnes (1848 Arthur Hughes)<br />Italia and Germania (1828 by Johann Friedrich Overbeck)<br />The Study of Gneiss Rock at Glenfinlas* (1853 John Ruskin)<br />The Girlhood of Mary Virgin (1848-9 Rossetti)<br />Ecce Ancilla Domini!** (1850 Rossetti)<br />Covenant Thoughts (1850-1 Millias)<br />Ferdinand Lured by Ariel (1849-59 Millias)<br />The Hireling Shepherd (1851-2 Hunt)<br />Claudio and Isabella** (1850-3 Hunt)<br />Ophelia**1/2 (Millias)<br />The Awakening Conscience* (1853-4 Hunt)<br />April Love** (1855 John Ruskin)<br />The Light of the World* (1851-3 Hunt)<br />Monna Vanna* (1866 Rossetti)<br />The Blind Girl*** (Millias--a woman with young child as the woman's eyes are closed and the child looks back to see a double rainbow!

He completed it by raising up a labor force of thousands in seven years.  Made from the cedars of Lebanon cut by the skilled hands of the Sidonians and large, costly hewn stones for the foundation, &quot;The whole temple he overlaid with gold until he finished all the temple; also he overlaid with gold the entire altar that was by the inner sanctuary.&quot; (I Kings 6:22.)  This, and the churches included in Dupre's awesome collection, is the way a church SHOULD be made!<br />I'm so ecstatic to have found this gorgeous book because it has touched my heart and soul with a desire to worship God in His Holy Temple. It is my goal in the upcoming new year to find a church to worship God along with my family He has blessed me with, and be edified together along with the fellow members of believers. Also, I have a deep desire to travel in my lifetime and hope to actually visit as many of these churches as possible!The church building is vital, uniting the congregation together into the proper mindset for worship. John 4:23-24. Yet we remember that Jesus abides in our hearts eternal so we can worship Him anywhere, anytime.<br />Thank you Judith Dupre for your awesome, edifying work, all the gifted architects AND photographers, the worshippers, as well as Mario Botta for your interview.  (Review title quote from page six, taken from Exodus 25:8.)  God bless you worshippers everywhere. Go with God and Soar in o8E!	2003-12-21

Any girl should love this book with a sweet story by Sweeney and lovely illustrations of kitties and ballerinas plus an introduction to the renown French artist, Edgar Degas (1834-1917) whose studies of ballerinas are known for their \\"mastery of motion and for reviving the lost art of pastel.\\" Degas is considered one of the great artists of his time and Leslie Wu's illustrations are in keeping with his style but with her own unique vision and bolder use of color.  Great job, Leslie! I wish more stories were tributes to great artists like BIJOU, BONBON & BEAU--Sweeney and Wu set a nice example I hope others follow.<br />\\"No one saw a cat slip through the back door.\\" Kitties may cause mischief, yet can win over even the grumpiest of persons, in this case, Mr. Klenk. I don't want to give away the story, so please enjoy reading this amusing book with your little girl, or buy it for your older reader. Great book for girls aged five to twelve.<br />As a dear friend of mine recently shared with me, \\"Kitties are angels in fur.\\" So true. I certainly love my cat and can't imagine what I'd do without her. I've only had her close to two months and it feels like a lifetime.<br />Soar!	2003-11-25

Books	5	2	3	N	N	"Give to the world the best that you have...	and the best will come back to you.\\" (Unknown)<br />A cute little boy wants a doggie but doesn't have enough money.  He has saved some money but it isn't enough. (Oh! I wish there were more books on saving money! Kids need them.) The pet store owner shows him other pets he can afford but the boy's mind is made up.  He goes home and has a lemonade stand but it rains and he catches cold and can't do anything to make money to buy that doggie in the window. In the meantime, his sister, mom and dad each have a need that he can fill with some of his money and he gladly does so without hesitation. At the end of the week, he counts the money in his piggy bank and realizes he can't afford the doggie.  He accepts this (another great lesson for kids to learn--to accept when they can't have something) and goes to visit the doggie just to say, \\"Hello.\\" How sweet.<br />Good things happen to that little boy, I think, for the rest of his life with such a kind, giving heart.  Thanks, Iza for a very special story with lots of takeaway value.<br />Soar!	2003-11-25

TOBY, WHERE ARE YOU? definitely lets her have fun finding Toby.  And he isn't very easy to find! Sometimes when she finds him we both can't help but to crack up laughing at his hiding \\"position.\\" For example, the favorite page by far of both my daughter and I is when his mother in her long, flowered gown is searching her floor to ceiling bookshelf and doesn't notice that Toby is actually on all fours on the table beside the bookcase, with the glass lamp shade on his shoulders and bottom! Lol! Also, the illustration of \\"He's not outside\\" is hiliarious.<br />A book that encourages shared interaction and laughter is fun for both the parent and child.  Thanks, Steig and especially Euvremer for your delightful illustrations with use of dots of texture and light tones. My daughter and I soar to this one!	2003-11-25

Books	5	4	4	N	N	Great for little adventurers	This book is similar to \\"I'm a Little Teapot\\" in that the story follows a runaway dog through zany adventures through sightseeing in New York City, mountain climbing (my daughter laughs hard on this one), surfing the ocean, exploring the desert, being in a rodeo (love the cowboy boots on each of his four feet--lol!), and examining a cave.<br />The reader sings the story (twelve stanzas) using the familiar tune of the book's title.  My daughter loves this and all Iza Trapani books for the colorful, funny illustrations as well hearing the songs. Singing books are entertaining and educational, teaching your child valuable listening skills and understanding pitch.  My daughter sings right on key and has a good sense of rhythm and I believe Iza's books have greatly helped her achieve this. Thanks, Iza! How about a kitty book?  Takeaway value: There's no place like home.<br />Soar!	2003-11-25

My daughter can get pretty worked up at times and I have always enjoyed using books as a quiet, peaceful and relaxing time for us to share.  GOD'S QUIET THINGS is just the book to do this with.<br />The illustrations include a boy and his cat and are somewhat muted and soft--a beautiful, well executed technique with pastels to heighten the idea of being quiet.  To listen for God's quiet things is a good way to open up your heart to God, for He is in them and all things beautiful.  \\"Be still and know that I am God.\\" Psalm 46:10a<br />GOD'S QUIET THINGS isn't a \\"story\\" per se, but a journey.

But mostly, he wanted a friend to hug.&quot;<br />Elliot doesn't want to hurt anyone so he tries hugging telephone poles, parking meters and traffic lights but they just don't cut it! Next he tries to disguise himself as a birthday present and even a Christmas tree (very cute) that people like but to no avail. Still he receives no hugs.  I think this has a great lesson to children that they should always be themselves and then they will know who their true friends are. To focus on who DOES like them and furthermore, what THEY LIKE to do--NOT to focus on who DOESN'T like them and what they ARE NOT good at.<br />Takeaway value: Go after what you want! Elliot does that...and so you think...maybe, somehow...he gets his hug?<br />Soar!	2003-11-25

For without love, our life is empty and incomplete. If you want to experience a touching story about Love--a pure, first love inundating with sincerity and respect, read UNFORGETTABLE. This book tells the story of true love from the heart of Charles Marshall--a shy, teenage boy who, when he first saw the lovely Cindy Beck knew instantly, &quot;That event changed the destiny of my life forever. Never again would I look at the world the same way.&quot;  Isn't that what love does?<br />He HAS to tell her how he feels, especially since his &quot;investigations&quot; turn out to his liking.  She has no boyfriend or hidden family secret; she's just beautiful, as he already knew, and has a wonderful personality. Charles decides to tell her &quot;everything...in a note.&quot; The priceless note to Cindy is simple yet conveys all he wishes he could say to her face but is too shy to. It is the kind of note all women wish to receive. There are various events this young couple shares: two of my favorite being the talent show in which they sing to each other; as well as the camping trip in which Cindy reassures Charles when he lovingly whispers in her ear for her to never leave him with, &quot;I will never, ever leave you. I promise for all eternity.&quot; Through it all, their unbreakable bond and unfaltering support of each other is what makes their love grow so deep and meaningful to them both (and to the reader.) There is wrenching pain and bottomless sorrow in the story but love is worth the pain. I've always believed that. Cindy kept her promise, for one doesn't have to be with another physically to cherish them forever in the spiritheart. Once you love, you can't stop loving. If you can, you never truly loved them in the first place.<br />For someone to write a story so precious is a noble and courageous thing and he is to be commended. My thanks to you, Frederick Babb. I can't wait to read your next book, TORN!<br />Soar! That's what anyone that ever truly loved you would want you to do.  And you should, for them and yourself.d your next book, TORN! <br />Soar!

Dali, born in Figueres, Spain on May 11, 1904, is probably my favorite Surrealist painter.<br /><br />What I enjoy the most are the color plates; however, a close second is the illuminating commentary by Mr. Wach of which he discusses the works' styles as well as the psychological content, both in succinct detail.<br />The book is broken up into six parts:*Preface and Acknowledgments, *Salvador Dali: An Introduction (including many pencil, ink and charcoal drawings as well as his life and influences,) *Colorplates (with commentary opposite pages,) *Biographical Chronology (full of seemingly day by day happenings of his life and works,) *Selected Bibliography and *Index.<br />For those considering purchasing this book, here are most of the color plates (*** stars are favorites of mine):<br />**View of Cadaques with Shadow of Mount Pani, ***Port of Cadaques (Night)[&quot;Contemporary witnesses recounted seeing the young Dali painting two canvases at once--one with his left hand and one with his right...one of the first hints at his later interest in double images and in stereoscopic vision.&quot; from the commentary.  I love this haunting painting.] **Self-Portrait (Figueres,) **Still Life: Pulpo y Scorpa, **Still Life: Sandia [&quot;...he was concerned with the more formal relationships of shapes that characterize the art of Cubism...&quot;], **The Basket of Bread, **Femme Couchee,  **Apparatus and Hand [...one of the most accomplished works of this period...this painting announces a fresh Mediterrean luminosity that was to stay with Dali, together with a more uninhibited repertoire of images and associations...&quot;], **The Bather, **Beigneuses [sic], **Dit Gros, Platja, Luna i Ocell Podrit (Big Thumb, Beach, Moon, and Decaying Bird), **Ocell...Peix, [...&quot;the painting's dark sky betrays its orgins in the Surrealist's experimental technique of grattage--a method of pictorial generation that relied upon the uncovered images formed by scratching back layers of ink or thin bitumen spread over preexisting work...&quot;], **The First Day of Spring, **The Profanation of the Host, **The Average Bureaucrat,  **Au Bord de la Mer, **Shades of Night Descending [&quot;...drawn from childhood memories of the Playa Confitera, a beach known and loved for its candy-shaped pebbles...&quot;), **Memory of the Child-Woman, ***Sugar Sphinx [&quot;...The large expanse of sky creates a quietly contemplative effect that is unique and hints at the solemnity of the theme...&quot;], ***Portrait of Gala [I wish I could include the entire commentary!], **Skull with Its Lyric Appendage Leaning of a Night Table Which Should Have the Exact Temperature of a Cardinal Bird's Nest [love this wacky title], **The Weaning of Furniture Nutrition, **Decalcomania, **Morphological Echo, ***Three Young Surrealist Women Holding in Their Arms the Skins of an Orchestra, **Tristan Fou, **Daddy Longlegs of the Evening--Hope!, **Old Age, Adolescence, Infancy (The Three Ages), **Geopoliticus Child Watching the Birth of the New Man, **Christ in Perspective, ***The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory, ***Nature Morte Vivante (Still Life-Fast Moving), ***The Discovery of America by Christopher Columbus, *** The Ecumenical Council [&quot;...The faith is mediated by the floating image of Gala as St. Helena,...The corss that she holds reflects the one in the hand of Christ, above her, who points upward to its spiritual significance...&quot;] ***Galacidalacidesoxiribunucleicacid [sic] (Homage to Crick and Watson)[say that fast three times! Heh.] and the final colorplate is from the book's cover, ***The Hallucinogenic Toreador.<br />I have enjoyed perusing over this fine book.  Recommended for eye-opening insight into Dali.  A few of my favorites paintings, &quot;The Persistence of Memory,&quot; and just two or three others are missing. But for what you get here, its definitely 5 stars.

RAINBOW SEA is a sparkle book, full of lavish, bold-colored art by the great marine artist, Christian Riese Lassen. The last page has one of my favorite pieces of his, \\"Galaxy of Life.\\" There are plenty of dolphins (including \\"Mother's Miracle,\\") as well as a few orcas, sea turtles and sperm whales. Also there's plenty of coral varieties and numerous, popular saltwater fish including one of my favorites, the Naso Tang.<br />The 'story' is actually a by-the-page account, which was wise on Jane Edgecombe's part. She makes Lassen's work shine even more by complementing--not competing against it. I appreciate her descriptive, sanguine poetry. Here's an excerpt:<br />\\"The orcas are leaping,<br />fins flap and tails wiggle,<br />Dolphins dive, coral dances,<br />and fish gleam and giggle.<br />The moon shines once more,<br />as they frolic with glee<br />At the rainbow of colors<br />that live in the sea.\\"<br />Another thing about RAINBOW SEA you'll love is that it very durable made of thin cardboard inside and a thick outside cover. The sparkling inserts into Lassen's art are not flush with the book but underneath making it impossible for young children to rip them out. So you can buy this for even the youngest book lover.  Yet the art is so entrancing that older kids, teenagers and adults can appreciate it! New target market age--two to one hundred and two!<br />I highly recommend this book for fans of Lassen's art and/or the ocean, its creatures and its Majesty! Christian brings it all to life. Dive right in! 9/10 stars. (I would have liked to see the more planets like in \\"Sanctuary,\\" \\"The Cosmos,\\" \\"Children of the Stars,\\" \\"Cosmic Voyagers\\" and \\"Eternity.\\" This concentrates on some of the horizon but mostly under the sea.) If you get this for your young kids, purchase \\"LASSEN ISLAND\\" for yourself.<br />Soar!	2003-01-28

The poor unfortunate man was unhappy, and when he \\"couldn't stand it any more, he ran to the Rabbi for advice.\\"<br />The Rabbi gives some rather interesting advice to say in the least.  The wisdom of the Rabbi isn't apparent until the end of the story, yet in the meantime the story gets extremely entertaining and downright hilarious to the point of hysterics at times--well for my daughter and me! The illustrations are some of the best I have seen as far as going with the story's context.<br />I highly recommend this book because it has it all: a funny and  entertaining story, hilarious illustrations, and a moral that I believe a child can understand well.

The recipe in the back is such an intelligent hook to get the ones that do the buying, us parents, to say yes to this one! I appreciate an entertaining book with clever marketing. You have to not only sell the kids but the parents too--Tunnell and O'Malley--GREAT JOB!<br />Note: This is a great bedtime story book because all of the culprits that ate Old Witch's pie fall asleep in her house.  They aren't scary and my daughter scares pretty easily. I highly recommmend it! Great price too! 9/10 stars.	2002-10-07

The love was still there.  The little girl knew this, not because of what was left behind tangible to her eyes (which I will save for you to enjoy when you get this book) but what was left behind which was intangible--they could feel each other's hearts! Perhaps because of the promise to see one another again...perhaps not.  I don't know.<br />But I do know this: what makes this book so special is there is an affinity to it. An AFFINITY. And true affinity never goes away, it stays.  I dedicate this book to my priceless friends God has blessed me with that have stayed with me and have never left--even when I thought they did.

I went through hundreds, I just always loved books.  Time passes quickly and suddenly you are a parent. You naturally want to share your favorite childhood books with your child, only to realize you don't remember them! Well, WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE isn't one of those forgotten books.<br />It is a story of Max who was a bit too \\"wild\\" for his mom to handle one night. She called him, \\"WILD THING!\\" and Max said, \\"I'LL EAT YOU UP!\\" He shouldn't have said that because his mother promptly sent him to bed without supper.  But Max's room transformed into a magical place. With trees and vines that \\"grew and grew,\\" it became \\"the world all around.\\" His very own private boat sailed him off \\"to where the WILD THINGS are.<br />The reader is pulled into the story with the amazing illustrations, (chiaroscuro in top form) and the interesting, succinct story. The child BECOMES Max and enjoys ruling over the wild things and doing wild things like dancing and howling under the moon. Each wild thing is very expressive and interesting to look at--so much so, that now there are collectibles of each one in toy stores! I think that the way they are rendered--not scary, not cute, but so wonderfully ambiguous, is what brings the reader back again and again. Bravo, Mr. Sendak!<br />WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE is, in my opinion, a must-own book for children of all ages. It earns the highest recommendation for a children's book. No wonder everyone gives it 5 stars; it's a true classic and winner of the Caldecott Medal for the \\"Most Distinguished Picture Book of the Year.\\" Get a copy today to share with your \\"wild things.\\"	2002-08-15

She will be four soon and still loves this book! She enjoys the rhymes and bright, bold colors--and the bunny.<br />I think what makes this book so special, among many things, is that it's short, full of contrasting, bright colors, and the fact that \\"Mommy\\" is reading it.  I cuddle up with her and have the lights dimmed and she's dressed and ready for bed with her favorite blanket, relaxed and ready to look and listen.<br />The part after, \\"Goodnight comb, And goodnight brush,\\" where it next says, \\"Goodnight nobody,\\" I have placed a baby picture of my daughter and we say together, \\"Goodnight________,\\"(her name.)  She enjoys seeing herself in the book and I think it's great for her to basically tell herself to go to sleep!<br />The last full-page spread (which by the way, every colored page is a full-page spread) is particularly pleasant; the lights are dimmed in the baby bunny's room, he's in in his pajamas in his bed under the covers and the only things that are dominant and glowing are the moon and night stars, the fire in the fireplace, and the toyhouse's lights. Looking at that, what else would a child want to do but follow the bunny's lead and go to sleep? Goodnight Moon! (Big yawn...)<br />Suggestion: If your child doesn't want to let you leave after reading the book, you can make up your own \\"Goodnight ROOM\\" story and help him/her say goodnight to objects in his/her room. This in addition to the book, should do the trick!	2002-07-30

But do parents really want to wait until a child is 4 to begin teaching colors? I know I don't.<br />Knowing that, my daughter is almost 4 and has had this book over a year. She doesn't intentionally destroy things yet somehow she has torn out one of the tabs completely and some of the flaps. Don't get me wrong. COLORS is a good, fun, educational book my child LOVES! It just isn't very durable for the NEEDED age group, in my opinion, that it SHOULD HAVE BEEN MARKETED FOR. (Colors can be taught before a child begins to speak, just hand them an object and state its color.) COLORS needs TRUE primary and secondary colors! It has primary red (great), primary yellow (terrific), a lime green (huh?), soft pink (why?), light blue (needs to be primary blue), a true secondary orange (good!), and then white and black. All I'm saying is the colors should have been taken from the color wheel and sequenced so--Red, purple, Blue, green, Yellow and orange. White and black are good to have in there, I agree.<br />I give it 4 stars because of the following SUPERB features:<br />1  Even though one of the tabs and page got ripped the book is VERY STURDY and WELL MADE.  Accidents happen, she just got frustrated and couldn't pull the tab down so she ripped it down.<br />2  EACH COLOR IS SPELT OUT when my daughter pulls the tab on the left side of the full page spread of each color (bravo-helps me teach spelling/sounding out the word.)<br />3  The pull out tab pictures and lift flaps on the right are FAMILIAR and POPULAR OBJECTS to my daughter and are a GREAT REINFORCEMENT of the color she is viewing.<br />4  SHE LOVES IT! And that is what matters the most.<br />BOTTOM LINE: If the tabs were stronger and the colors truer (all primary and secondary,) then this would have been a 5 star book.	2002-06-18

FRANKLIN AND THE THUNDERSTORM is a colorful, entertaining, imaginative young reader book dealing with a relevant issue--FEAR.  We all have them so this young reader book is sure to grab the child's attention.  There is conflict and character growth, the formula for a great story a child will remember and ask for again.<br />Franklin's mother sends a reluctant and nervous turtle dressed in galoshes and a rain hat, carrying an umbrella, over to his friend, Fox's house as a storm begins to brew.  When he arrives, there are three other animals there sharing their opinions about the approaching thunderstorm such as: \\"My fur feels funny,\\" says Fox. \\"My feathers get all ruffled,\\" says Hawk. \\"I can smell a storm coming,\\" says Beaver sniffing. No one seems to be scared but Franklin. But he is scared enough for all four of his buddies! The storm hits full force and they all run inside.  When the power goes out Franklin is so terrified he retreats inside his shell and no kind of coaxing on anyone's part, even treats from Mrs. Fox, will get him out. So Franklin's friends use their imaginations and begin talking about the CLOUD GIANTS.  Whether the Cloud Giants are bowling or playing drums in the sky (thunder,) swinging from chandeliers or turning their lights on and off (lightning,) the illustrations are what make the story so great.  Beaver quotes Mr. Owl's factual definition of thunder and Franklin, by this time, is out of his shell and smiling.  Fox and his friends go back outside and Franklin discovers a rainbow. What Franklin say at the ending rounds out this very special story.<br />*You should buy this for the funny illustrations of the Cloud giants and what Franklin says about rainbows alone.  Wonderful short story for ages 4-8. I got a set of 4 Franklins in a book club for my young daughter and this is her favorite.	2002-05-13

It was more than any child could dream.\\" (I'll leave the descriptions to Max--I can't say it any better.) But the thing that made it most special of all was the fact Shaddai was always near.  The children listened to his terrific stories and songs and loved his smile and the way he made them laugh.  But most of all the children loved the way he made them feel--understood, loved and accepted for who they were. \\"His giant heart had a hundred strings--each held by a different child. And Shaddai loved each one the same.\\"<br />That's why he built the wall.<br />He warned the children that they weren't made for the the terrible land beyond the wall and to stay where they'd be safe and where they belonged--with him.<br />One child, Paladin was a very curious child. He questioned Shaddai about the wall and then told Shaddai that if he didn't fix it the children might leave.  Shaddai replied, \\"I know, Paladin.  But I want the children to stay because they WANT to, not because they HAVE to.\\"<br />The ending is beautifully poignant.  Please get this book for your child.  It's a great start or reinforcement for helping them understand that God has chosen them but THEY have to choose whether or not they want God.  God loves us enough to give us free will.	2002-05-13

It is about orphans finding out they are going to be adopted by the king.  They are very excited and don't know what to do. The townspeople tell them they need to prepare fine gifts to \\"impress him when he arrives,\\" so each one begins working fervently preparing his/her gift.  One of the orphans can't think of a skill/gift she has and goes to each of the other orphans asking for help.  Each one is abrupt, sending her off saying they are in a hurry and don't have time to help her. The girl feels she has nothing to give and is very sad.<br /><br />The king comes dressed in common clothes and the orphan who has no gift greets him and feeds and grooms his donkey. She sees that this man is very tired and offers him a place to rest. When he wakes up he then goes out to find his orphans and later returns to the girl caring for his donkey, disappointed because everyone was too busy to see him.<br />The king tells the orphan girl she gave the best gift of all...<br />There is so much beauty in this book.

On the cover, it has Joseph sleeping in his coat of many colors, dreaming of the sheaves bowing down to his sheaf. Throughout the entire book there is a realistic, vividly colored, full-page illustration to go with each story. The stories are not too long are too short. I can read two stories a night to my daughter (she's three) and also some other books. She loves the pictures and listens to the stories attentively.<br />A FAMILY TREASURY CLASSIC BIBLE STORIES contains 33 popular Old Testament stories, and 42 well-known New Testament stories; each your children will enjoy and learn a great deal from. I've been looking for a collection such as this since my daughter was born and this is the first one that I liked enough to purchase. I believe you will enjoy it as much as your kids do, I know I do! Enjoy.	2001-10-24

I saw this on someone's listmania list and as soon as I saw the cover I was so excited to have rediscovered one of my favorite childrens books! When I received it from Amazon it and opened the pages it was as if I became a child again--experiencing pure joy, wonder, amazement and a heart full of laughter. I'd like to think I am still that way...but there is nothing purer than a child. We can only hope and strive to keep the &quot;child&quot; in our hearts forever.<br />I was so mesmerized by the tale and also how my favorite brother was the First Chinese Brother and his special talent for swallowing the sea. When I read it to my soon-to-be three year old daughter, we giggled at his funny faces trying to get the little boy to come back before he exploded! (After all IT IS &quot;very hard to hold the sea.&quot;) Then when the First Chinese Brother couldn't hold the sea any longer and did explode my daughter and I went into uncontrollable laughing fits! Well, the little boy should have listened and kept his word to mind him! But each Chinese Brother is intriguing and thoroughly entertaining!<br />This is a very engaging tale and not until NOW do I see the deeper meaning: we all have special gifts and need to discover them and by all means use them! They are of extreme necessity to us and to those we come in contact with. Let them shine by sharing! Also this book teaches each of us to remember to keep our priorities straight in this journey we call Life.<br />I would like to thank douglasb@san.rr.com for his comments. I haven't thought of that and will keep what he said in mind. We should always try to be ready to give our children an answer to their questions. Great point. Thank you.	2001-08-30

Therefore whoever humbles himself as this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoever receives one little child like this in My name receives Me.&quot;  THE HOLY BIBLE Matthew 18:1-5.<br />______________________________________________________________________________<br />Wow! JESUS WANTS ALL OF ME is something like I would want to write for kids! It is perfect--size, length of words, illustrations, layout, and concluded with a short verse from HOLY scripture! You and your child will love this! My daughter is crazy over it! She loves to carry it around with her and loves me to read it to her!<br />We must instill in the hearts of our children the love of God &quot;which passes all understanding&quot; NOW. There is no time to waste.<br />Let's fulfill our responsibilities as parents: &quot;Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.&quot; THE HOLY BIBLE Proverbs 22:6. JESUS WANTS ALL OF ME is a great aid for parents to do just that! ___________________________________________________________________________________<br />Here is a sample; it is bookmarked in my copy: (Hmmmmm...)<br />&quot;SHARE!<br />God doesn't care how good I act on the outside.  He doesn't care how many nice things I have.  He just wants me to be like Jesus.  He doesn't want me to keep my life closed up like a bottle with the top on. He wants me to take the top off and pour myself out.  He wants me to share myself.&quot; [pretty picture of grapes and a glass of wine/grape juice.] &quot;He who believes in me...out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.&quot;<br />SO BEAUTIFUL--BUY THIS BOOK TODAY!	2001-06-01

I must write her introduction for you: [shortened]<br />&quot;God speaks to us continually. He speaks to us through His word and His servants...If we listen.<br />&quot;We are pursuing a closer walk with God and a deeper understanding of His thoughts toward us.  His longing to be close to us far exceeds our desire for Him.  The friendship He wants with His children is clearly evident in the Scriptures and the true disciple will seek such a relationship fearlessly and faithfully.&quot;<br />&quot;When we listen to God speak to us, we can see that through the Scriptures He has truly presented Himself as wholly as our souls can grasp.&quot;<br />&quot;The scriptures show us the way to God.  If we study His words, meditate on them, act upon them, we can begin to understand our high calling as children of God in an altogether new light.  Each devotion in this book shows the scripture verses to be read and meditated upon each day. As we absorb His words, His presence permeates us and we truly know we have a heart for God, a heart that only He can satisfy...&quot;<br />___________________________________________________________________________________<br />My favorite chapter is &quot;The Gift of Joy.&quot; GOD puts the JOY in my heart, soul and name EACH DAY.<br />Each chapter is very well-written, succinct and pleasurable to read (easy to read because of the fantastic layout.) Even if you dislike devotions, I guarantee you will love this one. It is unlike any other.<br />&quot;HIS GIFTS TO ME&quot; IS ESSENTIAL READING FOR EVERY SEARCHER--PLEASE GET YOUR HANDS ON THIS BOOK!<br />Thank you from the bottom of my heart Marie! God bless you always.	2001-05-04

To my delight, it has a few new illustrations now [black children are included.]<br />The wording of MY LITTLE GOLDEN BOOK ABOUT GOD can be at times too lengthy for a preschooler but it adds to the appeal later in life. My two-year old daughter has never complained though, she is mesmerized by the pictures just as I was at her age! Children love to listen to any story with illustrations this magnificient. Way to go Eloise Wilkin! I finally get to thank you after 30 years!<br />I highly recommend this book because I remember it fondly and vividly from childhood. I had countless books growing up but this is one of only a handful that I remember and that is also etched into my heart forever.

My daughter received this book as a gift over a year ago and she still brings it to me to read it to her!  Now that she is older, she looks at it by herself also. She never bores of it. I think your child will enjoy it too.<br />Here is an excerpt for you:<br />&quot;Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet are friends. They like to do things together. In SPRING, they go for a walk in the rain.<br />They fly kites on windy days.<br />When summer comes, Pooh and Piglet go swimming in the pond...&quot;<br />Other things they do together is: in the SUMMER, Pooh and Piglet chases fireflies while Pooh counts the stars; in AUTUMN, Pooh rakes leaves and Piglet jumps into the pile, and Pooh picks apples while Piglet gathers acorns; in WINTER, they build a snowman, and Pooh and his friends go skating on the frozen pond. [Kanga, Roo, Tigger and Rabbit are also there.] Great book to teach the seasons to your child!<br />What is I appreciate the most about this book is it shows a child that just being together with friends and loved ones is special--it doesn't matter what you do, as long as you do it together! Another lesson learned is you don't have to like all the same things in order to be friends. Pooh and Piglet are best friends because they accept and respect each others' differences.<br />I highly recommend this book! (A must-own for Pooh and Piglet fans!) It is very colorful and beautifully illustrated (couldn't be better!) and it always brings a smile my daughter's face--mine too! Pooh and Piglet are great examples to all of us how friends should treat each other--with kindness, courtesy, respect and lots of love.	2001-01-31

THE AESOP FOR CHILDREN WITH PICTURES by Milo Winter is a wonderful storybook full of stories every child should own. Aesop's fables are short stories with a moral at the end. This is a beautifully illustrated hardcover book that will last much longer than a paperback version. I highly recommend this out-of-print edition over the paperback that is readily available just for this reason! This book is very well organized and has mostly small illustrations (either 3x5 or 5x7; but eleven are full-page illustrations!) The moral is in italics at the end of each fable so it is easy to spot. Sometimes I choose a moral first and then read that fable to my daughter.<br />There are a total of 112 fables! I will not list them all but some of the more popular ones which happen to be my personal favorites: THE FOX AND THE GRAPES, THE LION AND THE MOUSE, THE SHEPHERD BOY AND THE WOLF, THE CROW AND THE PITCHER*, THE DOG AND HIS REFLECTION, THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE**, THE FOX AND THE CROW, and THE NORTH WIND AND THE SUN. (The * means my favorite-- ** means my second favorite.)<br />THE AESOP FOR CHILDREN WITH PICTURES has so many fables I am confident that you will find your favorites as well as discover many new favorites! I highly recommend this book full of wisdom and morals for anyone at any age! Enjoy this alone or with your children or grandchildren!	2001-01-29

I love this book because it is so small that I can carry it with me in my purse. I like to get it out on a break at work and read a chapter on what I feel I need help with; it always picks me up and encourages me. What simple and brief yet wonderful advice! As I read I highlight the areas most applicable to me so that next time I read it I can read exactly what I most need to hear. Most chapters have a space that I use for notes and comments. Keep in mind that this is not a quick read. To make real changes in your life, I recommend this book should be read slowly, one to three chapters a day. When I first began, I tried to read straight through but it just goes in one ear and out the other. You have to read a chapter, stop, and think about it to best apply it to your life and make it work for you.<br />One of my favorite chapters is chapter six: REMIND YOURSELF THAT WHEN YOU DIE, YOUR &quot;IN BASKET&quot; WON'T BE EMPTY. I think the whole world should read this chapter! Here is an sample:<br />&quot;SO MANY OF US LIVE OUR LIVES AS IF THE SECRET PURPOSE IS TO SOMEHOW GET EVERYTHING DONE....OFTEN WE CONVINCE OURSELVES THAT OUR OBSESSION WITH OUR &quot;TO DO&quot; LIST IS ONLY TEMPORARY--THAT ONCE WE GET THROUGHT THE LIST, WE'LL BE CALM, RELAXED AND HAPPY. BUT IN REALITY, THIS RARELY HAPPENS. AS ITEMS ARE CHECKED OFF, NEW ONES SIMPLY REPLACE THEM.  THE NATURE OF YOUR &quot;IN BASKET&quot; IS THAT IT'S MEANT TO HAVE ITEMS TO BE COMPLETED IN IT--IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE EMPTY....REMEMBER THAT NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR OWN SENSE OF HAPPINESS AND INNER PEACE AND THAT OF YOUR LOVED ONES. IF YOU ARE OBSESSED WITH GETTING EVERYTHING DONE, YOU'LL NEVER HAVE A SENSE OF WELL-BEING! IN REALITY, ALMOST EVERYTHING CAN WAIT...THE PURPOSE OF LIFE ISN'T TO GET IT ALL DONE BUT TO ENJOY EACH STEP ALONG THE WAY AND LIVE A LIFE FILLED WITH LOVE.&quot;<br />The book is organized, in my opinion, to be read in any order you want. Some chapters may be useful to you and some may not now but perhaps later on in your life. I find it very motivational. I think you will enjoy it also.<br />DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF...AND IT'S ALL SMALL STUFF--WORDS TO LIVE BY!ow but perhaps later on in your life. I find it very motivational.

I love books like this that have so many pictures that when I am too tired to read to my daughter verbatim, I can just tell her the story in my own words!<br />The pigs are all brothers who move away from their mother when she tells them &quot;This house is too small for all of us. It is time for you piglets to go out into the world and make homes for yourselves.&quot; The piglets pack up their suitcases, say good-bye to their mother and head down different paths. Well, we all know the story but I must say the wolf illustrations are hilarious! My daughter laughs out loud when I pretend I am the wolf and say &quot;then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll BLOW your house in!&quot;<br />The ending is particularly entertaining when the wolf gets to the last little pig who was a smart, hard-worker who wisely built his house composed of brick (quite a nice pad by the way!) Interestingly, I don't remember the ending quite like this--it is even better! Don't hestiate to get this book! It is a treat! Fourty-six illustrations in a 32 page book--some of them full page spreads--Wow!<br />It doesn't say, but I think he calls his mother regularly and misses his brothers too!

I'M A LITTLE TEAPOT ENCOURAGES YOUR CHILD'S CREATIVITY AND IMAGINATION and even better still, it ENCOURAGES YOUR CHILD to be like the Little Teapot and SHARE/EXPRESS HIS/HER DREAMS!

I requested she read it to me nightly for a long time! My Mother did the voices of the characters so great! As I got older, I read it on my own and I wore out the story, reading it countless times. As an adult, I still love the story because it is magical, suspenseful and just a little bit scary but not too much for a child.<br />This is a wonderful story with many morals. It TEACHES a child RESPECT for elders (definitely always an issue in the world today) and when unsure what to do, to go GET ADVICE FROM SOMEONE YOU TRUST before acting and to LISTEN to that wise advice VERY CAREFULLY. This book teaches a child to be COURAGEOUS and use wise advice along with her WITS, INSTINCTS and HEART to get out of perilous situations.<br />The Russian illustrations are very different than a typical American book; which I find very refreshing. It has vibrant primary colors and lots of black outlines to set the pictures off. Also the layout of pictures within the story is sheer genius.<br />The girl was badly mistreated by her stepmother but yet was kind and gentle, not letting it effect her personality. This is the moral from the book I appreciate the most. REMINDS ME OF A WISE SAYING:&quot;YOU CAN'T CONTROL THE SITUATION BUT YOU CAN CONTROL HOW YOU REACT TO IT.&quot; Children should be taught this truth from birth!<br />This is a great book! I highly recommend it. You may have to settle for one of the books in print right now but this one is the classic one to me--if you can get it, I think you will be very pleased.	2001-01-12

You don't need to read a word; I am talking breathtaking! WOW!<br />What I like best is the intricacy of it all. One can almost open the book and enter into the magical fairy world. The layout is absolutely perfect from cover to cover. You have got to see this to believe it! Every page is a visual feast for your eyes. You could spend a long time just absorbing the beauty without trying to find the hidden objects in the pictures. Another reviewer was correct about it being similiar to I-Spy books but so much better in my opinion!<br />There are not only fairies pictured but everything mystical: crystal balls, unicorns, gnomes, dragons, a sorceress, knights in full armor with swords, flying swan-shaped boats, jewels, mermaids, horses, and musical instruments all with lavish backgrounds and framed in edges. I repeat you have got to see this to believe it!<br />This book should proudly be displayed on a book holder placed on a shelf for you to admire. I have mine in the center of my fairy collection.<br />Thank you Carol! Your hard, time-consuming work really paid off! You are a true artist!	2001-01-11

All the Wemmicks were carved by a woodworker named Eli. &quot;Each Wemmick was different... but they all lived in the same village.&quot;<br />Every day the Wemmicks did the same thing, they gave each other stickers. The gold star stickers went to smooth, finely-painted and talented Wemmicks; the gray dots went to the rough, paint-chipped, clumsy Wemmicks. This is where Puchinello fits in. He always got gray dots. No matter how hard he tried, he never measured up to being worthy of a gold star to the other Wemmicks. He became very discouraged with gray dots all over him. Then one day he met a happy female Wemmick named Lucia who had no stars or dots and decided to take her advice and go see Eli the woodworker.<br />The next day, Punchinello went to see Eli. Eli called him by name. Punchinello was confused, wondering how Eli knew his name. Eli replied with &quot;Of course I do. I made you.&quot; Eli picked up Punchinello and mentioned he had some bad marks. When Punchinello  tried to explain stating &quot;I didn't mean to Eli, I really tried hard.&quot; Eli told him he didn't have to defend himself. &quot;I don't care what the other Wemmicks think.&quot; Punchinello was confused again. Eli then told him: &quot;ALL THAT MATTERS IS WHAT I THINK.  AND I THINK YOU ARE PRETTY SPECIAL.&quot;<br />The ending is wonderful! I won't give it away, but another reviewer was right when she said that this book should be read at the start of every day. YOU ARE SPECIAL is a life-changing book and a must own! You will not be disappointed. I highly recommend reading this with your child on a regular basis. (I say &quot;with&quot; and not &quot;to&quot; because this book is for everyone of all ages!)	2001-01-04

(Psalm 139) (Billy and Blaze Books)	Books	5	14	14	N	N	&quot;I WILL PRAISE YOU FOR I AM FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE.&quot;	This book is a great introduction to Psalms for you to share with your children. I bought this right away because since I was very young Psalm 139 has been very close to my heart. Oh but when I opened the book and read it to my child I had to read through tears. This is such a beautiful book with delightful yet simple illustrations. (Way to go Kristi!) Keep in mind the book is paraphrased from the Bible and not verbatim but a fantastic translation!<br />When your child is older and can read Psalm 139 (from the HOLY BIBLE) on his or her own it will make even more sense and beauty. The entire book is enthralling but especially the illustration inspired from verses 14-15 of Psalms 139! This particular illustration has a see-through version of a Mother's tummy with the baby inside. How perfect!<br />I highly recommend this book for parents to read to their child regularly! It's a very special book that illustrates a glimmer of our OMNIPOTENT AND OMNIPRESENT GOD! You won't be disappointed!<br />Thank you Joel!	2001-01-01

[The story of Corduroy displays several morals and our basic human needs; its main lesson to me is to look deeper, beyond first impressions to see what is on the INSIDE of a person--that is what really counts.] The story is so charming, adorable and incredibly special.<br />It begins with Corduroy in a toy department of a big store. Shoppers hurry by and never seem to notice him.[MORAL: TAKE TIME TO SMELL THE ROSES PEOPLE! WHY ALL THE RUSH?] Every day Corduroy waits hoping &quot;for somebody to come along and take him home.&quot; [ BASIC NEED: SECURITY AND BELONGING.]<br />One day a little girl stops to look at Corduroy and tells her Mother that he is the bear she has always wanted. The Mother explains to her daughter that they have spent too much money already and points out a flaw in Corduroy, he is missing a button. [MORAL: IF YOU CAN'T SAY SOMETHING NICE, THEN DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL!] The girl is very obedient and doesn't make a scene (like some children would today) and walks away with her Mother. [MORAL: RESPECT AND OBEY YOUR PARENTS.]<br />Corduroy decides to go look for his button that night. The INTRIGUING part here is Freeman doesn't state WHY Corduroy is looking for his button--is it to look better in order to get a home? (I really don't think so, nothing in this book is about vanity.) Why then? Answering that question is left up to each individual reader. [MORAL: LOOK FOR THE GOOD INSTEAD OF THE BAD IN PEOPLE AND THAT GOES FOR BEARS TOO!]<br />The next day, still buttonless, Corduroy wakes up to the warm smile of the girl who came to see him the day before. She introduces herself as Lisa and tells Corduroy that he &quot;is going to be [her] very own bear.&quot; She continues to explain that she counted her money in her piggy bank and her Mother said she could bring him home. [MORAL: PATIENCE AND SAVING MONEY.] She lovingly carried him home in her arms.<br />Corduroy looked around the room. &quot;This must be home,&quot; he said. &quot;I know I've always wanted a home!&quot; As Lisa sat down to sew a button on his shirt to make him more comfortable she said the sweetest thing, something every child (OK ALL OF US) need to hear: &quot;I LIKE YOU JUST THE WAY YOU ARE.&quot; And they give each other a hug.[BASIC NEED: LOVE AND ACCEPTANCE!]<br />I highly and wholeheartedly recommend this to children of ALL AGES!

FOR AGE 9-99!	First of all I must say anything DK Publishing touches turns to gold; and the same goes double to infinity for Vincent. You would not believe the information packed into this 64 page carry anywhere book full of photographs of family and places he lived, amazing sketches, personal belongings, influences, quotes, and over 70 of his most popular and beautiful paintings and so much more! This is for everyone! It does not include &quot;Starry Night&quot; however.<br />Here are the contents: 1  YOUTH AND FAMILY  2  LIFE IN ENGLAND  3  PREACHING AND POVERTY 4  THE IMAGE OF THE SOWER 5  ETTEN AND THE HAGUE 6  PEASANTS AT WORK 7  A LOVE OF NATURE 8  A MATTER OF FAITH 9  A PEASANT MEAL 10  ARRIVAL IN ANTWERP 11  THE ANTWERP ACADEMY 12  A PARISIAN EXPERIENCE 13  IMAGES OF PARIS 14  THE IMPRESSIONISTS 15  NEW APPROACHES 16  JAPANESE INFLUENCES 17  SUNFLOWERS 18  A STUDY IN YELLOW 19  THE LURE OF THE SOUTH 20  VAN GOGH AND GAUGUIN 21  A HEROIC SELF PORTRAIT 22  THE AFFLICTED ARTIST 23  NATURAL STUDIES 24  COPIES 25  PROVENCAL LANDSCAPE 26  AN ERRATIC RECOVERY 27  A RETURN TO THE NORTH 28  THE FINAL ACT 29  KEY DATES/ VAN GOGH COLLECTIONS 30  GLOSSARY/ WORKS ON EXHIBIT 31  INDEX/ ACKNOWLEDGMENTS<br />What makes this book so enjoyable is that it has it all. Most books I've seen on Vincent are either loaded with art but the book layout is impossible to read due to lack of organization; or the opposite--books with tons of information but nothing but black and white thumbnail sketches. This book is a gem; extremely colorful plus has some black and white-- but each and every page is fully organized and beautiful to read and look at. Bruce Bernard, you have got to be the most organized man in the universe! WOW!<br />A must own for anyone and everyone! Especially the beginner to intermediate van Gogh enthusiast, however; the personal belongings, photographs, quotes and succinctness of this book would be well appreciated by the most acumen of Vincent's studiers/admirers.<br />P.S. I highly recommend this book and any other of the series of Eyewitness books that strike your fancy. I also own book #25 Crystal and Gems.

The illustrations are so great that I bought this without even reading the book! When I read it to my daughter I was very happy with the story.<br />A witch decides to move into the TEN TIMID GHOSTS' happy haunted house. She scares each ghost away, one-by-one, using a different disguise or prop each time--skeleton, bat, ghoul, cat, owl, vampire, monster, spider, rat, and mummy. The last clever ghost the witch frightens away figures out that it was her the whole time and tells the other ghost friends who are now homeless in the woods. Now we've got ten Angry ghosts...I'm not going to give away the ending but it is terrific!<br />I highly recommend this book; not only is it entertaining with wonderful illustrations but it is a countdown backwards from 10 so it is good for any age child to enjoy! My daughter is 2 and can count to five (well sometimes... so this will come in handy once she has learned to count to ten then she can have a fun way to count backwards!

Any little girl would love this story about a Willow Green, young and pretty witch who wants to go out with the other witches on Halloween night but is &quot;just too cute.&quot; Her mother makes a scary mask for her so she can go and then shows her how to fly. Willow Green, the cute witch, crashes on her landing and gets a black eye, skins her nose and loses a tooth.  She is about to cry but all the other witches clap and cheer.  &quot;No need to wear the mask, they said, to join us in our flight.

I was browsing in a bookstore and recognized it IMMEDIATELY from childhood. I have read this book to my daughter since she was 1 month old and it is still one of her very favorite books! (She is 2 years old now.) Margaret WISE Brown was definitely WISE to write this endearing book which demonstrates the depth of a mother's love for her child.<br />The storyline is simple yet spellbinding--the bunny wants to run away from his mother.  Each time he imagines he is something different and his mother matches his imagination by becoming whom or whatever is needed to find him: he's a fish, she's a fisherman; he's a rock, she's a mountain climber; he's a flower (crocus), she's a gardener; and my personal favorite (as a child and still today) he's a bird, and she's the tree that he comes home to; and more.<br />This is a very special book in so many ways. The bright colors on every other full page spread make the book more captivating because of the contrast from the black and white illustration on the previous full page. (In other words, the color alternates with black and white.) But the story of the mother's love which makes the bunny realize how lucky he is to have a mother who would literally follow him to the ends of the earth to be with him and protect him and just love him...THAT is what touches me the most.<br />Bottom line, this book should really be available in a gold edition because that is what it will always be worth to me and my daughter. I highly recommend this to all--both young and old. (Check out GOODNIGHT MOON as well.)<br />Thank you, Margaret for such a heart-felt story of love; and thank you, Clement for your bright and joyful illustrations!	2000-10-15

BABY ANIMALS isn't just illustrations of babies, it has the mother lovingly pictured beside its baby too--very endearing.  Here are the animals pictured with their mothers: ducklings, raccons, piglets, a fawn, puppies, a colt, a joey (kangaroo), a baby panda, a baby elephant, baby opposums, chicks and bunnies.<br />What makes BABY ANIMALS so appealing is the fact that the illustrations are excellent but the BACKGROUND COLORS are very bright and colorful; this accents the pictures to their BEST GRAPHIC ART EFFECT!<br />The only flaw is that there aren't any words (animals' names), however; BABY ANIMALS works as a fabulous teaching guide to VIEW WITH YOUR CHILD to teach him/her animal names, sounds they make and colors! My daughter loves looking at the pictures and knows most of the animals names and sounds and her colors--and she isn't even 2 yet!<br />I highly recommend this book! Amazon please order more so everyone can buy and enjoy this wonderful book! Great job Lisa Bonforte! Thank you!	2000-10-03

HIS CHILDREN&quot;	DESIGNED BY GOD SO I MUST BE SPECIAL is a colorful, positive book that will truly make your child feel special and build his/her self confidence.<br />My daughter really loves the pictures and hearing about how God blessed her with so many gifts that we as adults may sometimes take for granted (our sense of sight, hearing, touching and smelling [taste was not included] and more.) This is really a 4 1/2 star book only because God's name is mentioned only on the cover, dedication page (above title) and the first page of the book. The rest of the pages start with &quot;HE&quot;, however, this is easily remedied. When I read it to my daughter I just add &quot;GOD&quot; to each page and it works perfectly. In my opinion that is the only flaw in the book.<br />If I am running late putting my daughter to bed, I've found that the story is just as charming if I read only the first paragraph on each page (it has 3.) Also DESIGNED BY GOD SO I MUST BE SPECIAL is a great training tool to teach your child objects from the book. I say &quot;where's the: flower, butterfly, cloud, dog, cat, bunny, frog, fish, rainbow, bird, bees, bed, bathtub, sun, tree,&quot; etc. and my daughter will search for the object and point to it.<br />I must include the last page of the book for you so you'll know what you are missing if you don't own this:<br />&quot;HE GAVE ME MY SPIRIT SO THAT I COULD KNOW THAT HE'S ALWAYS BESIDE ME EVERY PLACE THAT I GO.<br />TO LOVE ME, PROTECT ME, TO SHOW ME THE WAY, TO BE THERE IN HARD TIMES AS WELL AS EACH DAY.<br />HE DESIGNED ME WITH SPECIAL TALENTS, GIFTS AND ABILITIES YOU SEE, WHICH LET ME KNOW THAT HE HAS SOMETHING SPECIAL IN MIND FOR ME.&quot;<br />I highly recommend this VERY SPECIAL book for home and the church library.

By doing this we show our love and the child eventually realizes &quot;NO ONE WILL EVER LOVE YOU AS MUCH AS YOUR PARENT(S)!&quot;<br />This is a timeless classic because I think it will stick with your child as he/she grows up and then he/she will realize that the roles have reversed and now it is his/her time to give. Of course we should always give to others throughout our lives but children are born selfish and have to learn/be taught how to give. This book will help you teach your child that. I highly recommend THE GIVING TREE.	2000-09-27

It has 4 printed buttons you push to start the song and a speaker on the side of the book. Inside the book contains 3 well-known children Christian songs: &quot;Jesus Loves the Little Children&quot;; &quot;This Is My Father's World&quot;; and &quot;Oh, How I Love Jesus.&quot; The fourth song was new to me called &quot;Walking With Jesus.&quot; But because the words and music are there, even if you don't know any of the songs you can sing along to the music! It is so simple and fun to sing along to!<br />This is great to own to reinforce Bible Songs your children learn in Sunday School class or to use if you can't make church! I highly recommend this book! It has beautiful, pastel, nostalgic photography of both girls and boys complete with lovely scenery from God's glorious creation-- a girl sniffing flowers, a girl holding sunflowers in a wheat field, a girl with a baby lamb  sitting right beside her in a meadow, and two cute young boys at the beach. JESUS LOVES THE LITTLE CHILDREN would make a wonderful gift--great for new Moms, young children, or for your church library!<br />Another wonderful aspect of this book is the batteries last a LONG time! I bought this over a year ago and it still plays! But when you need batteries (and you will because your child will love this forever) the book includes on the 1st page in tiny print &quot;Instructions for Battery Replacement&quot; as well as how &quot;To Order Replacement Batteries--only 2.99 and the mailing address.)<br />If you buy this book you will not be disappointed! I got it for my daughter at around 10 months and she is going to turn 2 and still loves it! She pushes the buttons now and I sing whichever one she pushes! The songs are just the right length--not too long or short! You'll love it as much or more than your child!	2000-09-27

Grover was my favorite Sesame Street character as a child (and still is) and for some strange reason it isn't easy to find books on him. This one is so cute and adorable, just like &quot;Lovable, Furry, Old Grover&quot; himself!<br />As the adult you open the first page and instantly know the conclusion but looking at it from a child's viewpoint it is suspensefully entertaining. If you have a child that pushes books away alot I promise you he or she will NOT do that with THIS BOOK!<br />I highly recommend this book up to age 100! It is simply hiliarious! (When I first read it in the store I cracked up laughing and people were looking at me and I didn't care!) BUY THIS BOOK! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED--I PROMISE! YOU'LL PROBABLY LOVE IT MORE THAN YOUR CHILD! IT IS VERY FUN TO READ!	2000-09-25

[Ha!] Grover notices this too and says &quot;Where did they put everything else?&quot; He comes to this giant double-door with a sign above it that of course says &quot;EVERYTHING ELSE.&quot; &quot;AHA!&quot; says Grover and enters.<br />This is one of the best, funniest books we own that my daughter and I BOTH enjoy. There are plenty of objects for her to learn and it is great entertainment reading a book with the charming, loveable Grover in it and laughing at all of his antics! Every family should own this book! I wish more books were this funny and entertaining yet a learning experience at the same time! 10 STAR BOOK FOLKS; IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!

There are so many flaps it keeps my daugher entertained for up to 30 minutes at a time--THAT is AMAZING! No other book we own can do that!<br />The first 2 pages are from THE CAT IN THE HAT (counting); pages 3 and 4 are from MR BROWN CAN MOO! CAN YOU? (animals); the 5th and 6th pages are from THERE'S A WOCKET IN MY POCKET! (fun creatures lurking about); the next 2 pages are from ONE FISH, TWO FISH, RED FISH, BLUE FISH (opposites); and the last two pages are from DR. SEUSS'S ABC. All the bright colors not only make the book visually appealing but serve as yet another training tool!<br />Lift-the-flaps is the rage these days because most books I think are so hard for children to turn the pages but the flaps are small like their hands and fingers! PERFECT, PERFECT, PERFECT! 10 STARS! THE CAT IN THE HATS' GREAT BIG FLAP BOOK is a MUST OWN! You will not be disappointed! Trust me!	2000-09-24

Books	4	3	4	N	N	FANTASTIC ARTWORK/GRAPHICS	HOW ARE YOU PEELING? is a excellent book with amazing artwork and bright contrasting colors. I'm sure most young children will really enjoy it. The vegetables and fruits are so cute! Ha. I 'feel' that while it encourages children to express their emotions it doesn't tell them WHICH emotion is BEST to express in the situation. As long as I keep this in mind and encourage my child to be aware of her feelings and, in time, learn WHEN and HOW is the best time to express them, this book can be a fantastic LEARNING experience as well as entertaining!<br />Emotions without boundaries = possible temper tantrums! I guess my having a two-year old explains a lot, huh? HOW ARE YOU PEELING is a very cute, colorful and entertaining book--I never knew vegetables were so sensitive! Ha. (Two more things that could have made this book even better would have been to mention that vegetables and fruits are YUMMY to eat; also it would have been a nice extra touch if it had scratch and sniff features. Kids adore that!)	2000-09-24

THE ITSY BITSY SPIDER deserves 5 stars just for the illustrations alone; it has all the colors in the rainbow plus a glossy sheen to highlight/accent them! Also the story is so cute and fun to read! I find no flaws whatsoever in this book--period. 10 STAR BOOK!<br />I really enjoy singing the song to the story (but it is like a poem, so it isn't necessary if you don't like to sing. If you need it, the music notes are on the last page of the book. You sing the same tune to all the verses of Iza's story.)<br />I ALWAYS sing the story as my daughter and I are reading it together all the way through. Then when I try to put the book down, she refuses and has to look through it again--the illustrations are that good! The second time I use it as a training tool to teach her the names of objects illustrated. I'll say &quot;where's the spider?&quot; (house, flower, butterfly, turtle, fruit, fan, yellow bucket, mouse, boots, green chair, boots, orange cat, tree, squirrel, rabbit, frog--you get the idea!)<br />THE ITSY BITSY SPIDER is a book for ALL AGES and guaranteed to induce smiles and giggles. You won't find a better childrens' book anywhere--believe me! (We own probably 50+ childrens' books!) Anything Iza does is top knotch but if you can only buy one of hers, this one's it! (But I highly recommend you get &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star&quot; also. &quot;I'm a Little Teapot&quot; is on its way...ok, I'm hooked but you will be too!) You won't be disappointed with Iza, trust me!<br />Thanks Iza!	2000-09-20

This is a beautifully illustrated story complete with gold highlights and lots of vibrant colors. It is set to the tune of &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star.&quot; Iza adds verses to make it a wonderful story: A little girl sits at her bedroom window and gazes out at the first star she sees and says &quot;...How I wish that I could fly, And visit you up in the sky. I wish I may I wish I might, Have the wish I wish tonight.&quot; The star appears at her window and says &quot;...I'll take you on a magic ride. So come with me--I'll be your guide...&quot; I won't share the whole journey but it is definitely magical!<br />On the last page of the book it includes the verses and music notes to the song. (But I doubt you'll need it; most of us have this song memorized!) Sometimes I sing the story other times I don't; it reads like a poem so you don't need to sing it unless you want to.<br />I will probably end up with all of Iza's books to read/sing to my daughter. I love them as much as she does! I highly recommend this book as well as &quot;The Itsy-Bitsy Spider.&quot; (The only two I own at this point.)

I'm so glad there are books out there like this to help children see that monsters don't have to be scary! (Now parents all over  the world can sleep better knowing their child won't wake them up at 2:00  am saying &quot;there's a monster in the closet; I'm scared!&quot; Well  hey, one less thing!)<br />Bravo to Laura Leuck and Mark Buehner! The story  and the illustrations are both hiliariously entertaining! Plus I think it  helps kids relate to the fact that there are lots of different and yes even  unusual types of people and families but hopefully they all love each other  the way THE MONSTER MAMA loves her little monster! Also it reminds me as a  parent that spending QUALITY TIME with my child is what lets her know I  love her! It is truly all the countless &quot;little things&quot; you do  for your child that add up. So go bake some cookies (but hold the bugs  please!)<br />I highly recommend this book for adults as well as children!  You'll both enjoy MY MONSTER MAMA LOVES ME SO, I guarantee it. Childrens'  books have come a long way since I was a child! Adults can get a laugh and  moral out of them too! After all, that is what books are for--to entertain  and to teach.	2000-08-31

Of course for a child usually the pictures are the first to impress. THE RAINBOW FISH will far exceed any child's  expectations! (Who doesn't love rainbow-colors with foil that sparkles even  in dim light!) Also the watercolor illustrations are delightful. The  complete package of the pictures PLUS the story is what makes this book  exceptional. The story is simple yet holds much wisdom.<br />THE RAINBOW FISH  is the most beautiful fish in the sea. All the other fish are amazed at his  outward beauty, however; judging from the way he responded to a simple  request to share, THE RAINBOW FISH shows his &quot;true colors&quot;  (vanity and selfishness.) Of course the news spreads throughout the sea and  soon no one will have anything to do with THE RAINBOW FISH. Sad and lonely,  he goes for advice from the Wise Octopus. She basically says &quot;SHARING  WITH OTHERS BRINGS TRUE HAPPINESS.&quot;<br />THE RAINBOW FISH reluctantly  takes her advice; and discovers she was right.  The more he shares the  happier he becomes. He realizes that life is not about &quot;getting&quot;  (being selfish) but &quot;giving&quot; (being generous.) And giving of  yourself is the greatest gift of all! (This is not about money.) Sharing is  a valuable lesson for children to learn and the sooner the better.<br />I  highly recommend this book! Five stars doesn't do it justice... it gets  that from the illustrations alone. If you don't already own it; get it! You  will not be disappointed.	2000-08-31

My (newest) favorites are: &quot;GALAXY OF LIFE&quot;,  &quot;COSMIC VOYAGERS&quot;, &quot;WHALE STAR&quot;, &quot;OUR  PLANET&quot;, &quot;SERENITY&quot;, &quot;SEA OF TRANQUILITY&quot;,  &quot;PARADISE&quot;, &quot;ANCIENT MYSTERIES&quot; and &quot;TEMPLE OF  LIGHT&quot;.

I never thought he could get any better but I was  wrong! He has taken his art to the outermost level that I can imagine.  &quot;The images I paint are no longer simply representations of the forms  of animals but the representations of their spirit&quot; Lassen states in  his essay.<br />&quot;Ranked the number nine surfer in the world, Lassen is  intimately acquainted with the mother ocean's ever-changing moods and  awesome power.&quot; [commentator]  Christian is one-in-a-million; not to  be compared with anyone else.

Simply stated, if you are pregnant  or even curious about the birth process, you MUST have this book!  If every  book was written as well as this one I'd read at least 2-5 a day!<br />Here is  a great quote from the 1st chapter which sets the tone:<br />THE MIRACLE OF  BIRTH: &quot;Every 55 minutes 10,000 babies are born all over the world.  Many hundreds are being born right now as you read this book! What is even  more amazing is that every one of those babies is different...

Another wonderful thing about this book  is that after almost every prayer it says &quot;Amen.&quot;  My daughter,  Kaitlyn will say &quot;Amen&quot; but she can't even say sentences yet!<br />The best part about this book besides the organization, is the variety  of prayers due to  the numerous people that contributed to it.

Here are some of the  writers/contributors (in random order): St. Augustine, Bishop Reynolds,  Charles Dickens, St. Fransis of Assisi, Sir Thomas Moore, William Penn,  Thomas Ken, William Carey, The Book of Common Prayer, C.F Alexander, John  Wesley, John Milton, John Hobbs, Michaelangelo and THE HOLY BIBLE to name a  few!<br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I enjoy praying for  longer periods; however, for most people this will be a 5 star book.  It is  not how long you pray; it is the heart's quality, not quantity.  God wants  us to talk to Him regularly and now you have a book to help you make prayer  a daily habit!<br />I highly recommend this book; it makes prayer so easy and  joyful to do!	2000-06-18

This book is truly one-of-a-kind; it is the stuff &quot;dreams are made of!&quot; It makes me smile and yawn reading to my daughter most every night!  She actually looks forward to going to sleep as much as I do!<br />It  is a child's Fantasy book. It truly entices your child to want to go to  sleep in such a beautiful way! The premise of the story is when you fall  asleep you enter into a dreamland--a magical place where you can fly in the  clouds, play with other boys and girls from around the world, ride on the  moon and stars and into the arms of.... ( it's a surprise).<br />Another thing  that makes this book so special is that it comes in your choice of pink or  blue lettering.

I took one look at this book tears welled up and knew it was a keeper; I bought it on the spot. It says what I think every parent feels about their  &quot;little angel sent from Heaven&quot; (as my Mom always called me.)<br />The story begins by telling the child &quot;long, long ago God made a  decision...a very important decision...one that I'm really glad He made.  He made the decision to make you.&quot;<br />The story truly expresses what we  as parents all want our children to know: they are very special, unique and  have our hearts wrapped around their fingers since birth and this will  never change.<br />&quot;...As you grow and change, some things will stay  the same. I'll always love you.  I'll always hug you.  I'll always be on  your side.  And I want you to know that... just in case you ever  wonder.&quot;<br />The ending is perfect; it talks about heaven. At the  beginning and end, there are a few blank pages that I took advantage of and  wrote some personal comments in my only daughter, Kaitlyn's copy.  I know  she will cherish this book forever and always know how much her Mom loves  her. Isn't that what you want for your children?  We are not immortal;  leave something behind for your child to treasure.  This book is a great  way to do it.	2000-06-18

I am going to quote some because without this knowledge you will have no idea what &quot;Within the Light&quot; is talking about.<br />&quot;The near-death experience is said to  occur when a person is close to death (or in many case actually clinically  dead), yet is resuscitated or somehow survives to recount an intense,  profoundly meaningful experience.  The near-death episode itself is  typically characterized by a feeling of peace, an out-of-body experience,  the sensation of traveling very quickly through a dark tunnel, generally  towards a light, an encounter with the spirits of deceased relatives or  friends or a &quot;being of light,&quot; an instantaneous life review, and  for some, entrance into a &quot;world of light.&quot;<br />&quot;Within The  Light&quot; has 5 main chapters: 1) Childhood Experiences  2) Suicides  3)  Frightening Experiences  4) Point of No Return  5) On the Other Side.  It  is concluded by an afterword, endnotes, bibliography, useful addresses and  an index.<br />One of my favorite sections is in Chapter 5 (On the Other  Side.) In my opinion this person's afterthoughts from her own NDE sum it up  best. &quot;I used to think you just died and that was it. But now I have  no fear of death at all. I see it purely as a homecoming, it is just a  total reunion, so much love and happiness. Intuitively I'm sure we go on  and continue to keep learning. We continue to grow on another  level...&quot;<br />I haven't experienced an NDE myself but I am a very deeply  spiritual person with similiar experiences of my own...<br />... &quot;SEEK  THE LORD, ... GROPE FOR HIM AND FIND HIM, THOUGH HE IS NOT FAR FROM EACH  ONE OF US; FOR IN HIM WE LIVE AND MOVE AND HAVE OUR BEING ... WE ARE HIS  OFFSPRING&quot; ...<br />THE HOLY BIBLE  ACTS 17:27-28	2000-06-15

It is the epitome of what any inquisitive person wants to know about how the human body works.<br />The editors say that it &quot;is intended to inform and entertain  reader's of all ages with explanations of the miracles and mysteries, the  foibles and frailties, of the human body...In question-and-answer format,  in an easy-to-read, informal style,...this book answers questions you have  wondered about your whole life.&quot;...<br />I have always been fascinated  with anything having to do with the human body; I almost majored in Nursing  in college.  If you would like to encourage your child to become a doctor  or nurse, become one yourself, or just be dazzled by God's creation of you;  then this is the book you've been searching for!<br />It has 12 Chapters: 1)  THE HUMAN BODY 2) THE BRAIN &amp; NERVOUS SYSTEM 3) THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 4)  THE HEART &amp; CIRCULATORY SYSTEM 5) THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 6) THE SKIN 7)  THE BONES &amp; MUSCLES 8) THE EYE 9) THE EAR, NOSE &amp; THROAT 10) THE  DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 11) THE URINARY &amp; REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS AND 12)  PREGNANCY, BIRTH &amp; GROWTH<br />The best reason to buy this book is it is  the EASIEST BOOK TO READ ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY YOU WILL EVER COME  ACROSS!<br />I highly recommend getting your hands on this book!	2000-06-15

I was window shopping at the mall and it was there just screaming out to me! I rushed into the store, flipped through it, saw the reasonable price and bought it without  hesitation. The high quality galleries are amazing!<br />The protective book  cover (which screamed to me) has his piece entitled &quot;Sanctuary&quot;  which in the book he says &quot;Sanctuary was created for the United  Nations to be used for its 1992 commemorative First Day Cover calling for  the preservation of the world's oceans...In this work, I have expressed the  interconnectedness that I see between Earth's life forms and the very basic  creative forces of the universe itself.&quot;<br />This book is priceless to  me. It has everything: from writings about Lassen's exotic background and  plenty of photos of him (surfing, beside his car and on his motorcycle,  with family and friends,) and 2 self portraits; to his spectacular work in  amazing color (over 100 plates in all!); to possibly the best part- his  notes on each plate which gives the reader insight into who Christopher  Riese Lassen really is.<br />It also includes many of his triptychs in  fold-out display.  I am a very proud owner of this book which will easily  be worth 10x or more than what I paid for it. It will remain priceless to  me.<br />I highly recommend you find a way to get your hands on this book!  Awesome!  This is a keeper!<br />I have to mention my personal favorite  plates: 1 ETERNITY 2 BLUE HANA MOON 3 AFTER THE STORM 4 NIGHT DANCER 5  SANCTUARY 6 IN ANOTHER WORLD 7 OUR WORLD 8 THE FALLS OF HANA 9 THE INFINITE  WAY 10 REVELATIONS 11 DREAM 12 TIGER 13 LAHAINA VISIONS TRIPTYCH<br />I COULD  GO ON FOREVER!
