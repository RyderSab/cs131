Sure, in hopes of saving someone else the money of buying it. Why didn't I finish reading it? Perhaps it was the:<br />1. Horrid logic. At the beginning, we learn that two events have already happened. A scientist has invented a chemical fertilizer for making the deserts bloom in Israel, which solves all of Israel's problems --even though Israel's problems are not generally considered to be agricultural in nature. And a nuclear attack on Israel by Russia is thwarted when the bombs explode over Israel without hitting the ground-- hardly much use when you consider the radiation that such bombs would have released.<br />2. Bad writing. If I ever hire a ghost writer, I'm gonna pick a guy who can write.<br />3. Stupid characters. By the time I threw the book across the room in disgust (around page 39), roughly 40 had been introduced, if you don't count the women. And you can't count the women, because all they do is act stupid and clingy and hang around waiting for the men to protect them, which the men do with the same consideration and kindness one might exhibit toward a wounded and exceptionally stupid sheep.<br />But perhaps I didn't give the series a fair shake. I couldn't. Nausea had set in. I will say this for it-- it has gotten a segment of the population reading that normally doesn't read much. <br />Unfortunately, it also promotes the belief that we won't be needing the world much longer, which has extremely unfortunate ramifications for the environment, public health, and international relations.	2004-06-20

Having read it as both, I see a lot more in it now. The theme of finding your own voice, shown through the main character's struggle to control a powerful magic cwidder (which seems to be something of a cross between a dulcimer and a kettle drum), resonates like a mountain-moving spell through every scene in the book.<br />Music seems to be a metaphor for writing, or for expression and discovery, as it is in many of Jones's books.	2004-06-20

Mr. Martin's narrative voice is so matter-of-fact and wryly humorous that it's hard to believe it's coming to you from the distant past.<br />There is as much social history as military here, as Mr. Martin describes his inoculation with smallpox, his shock at being introduced to a white Connecticut farmwoman's black husband, and the ubiquity of alcohol. <br />One is struck, in Mr. Martin's account, by how seldom the British /Hessians and American/French ever bothered to shoot each other. There seems to have been a consciousness of the enemy as a human being which made shooting him difficult. This could be hindsight on Mr. Martin's part, but it does jibe with the fact that the total combat death toll for the war (excluding disease and starvation) was around 5,000 on both sides.<br />Mr. Martin himself seems to have spent much of the war starving. He was only paid twice-- once when he signed up in 1776, and once in 1781 by French officers who dipped into their own pockets to give him a month's salary. Nor was he ever paid anything after the war by a grateful nation. Then again, given that American troops were fed by commandeering groceries, liquor and livestock from local farms, much of the nation may not have been that grateful.<br />You might be, though, after reading this book. I was. And it's good to remember that fighting for our nation's freedom, once upon a time, meant fighting on our own land instead of other people's.	2004-06-19

This book is too poorly written to read and understand. Problems in organization, narrative style and structure, plus an occasionally annoying narrative voice, make it difficult to figure out what is going on. The time sequence is random and much that is irrelevant is mixed in and has to be sorted through. <br />The author's coy refusal to state whether he believes Timothy McVeigh is guilty is negated by McVeigh's own post-conviction confession. <br />Had the author focused on his actual thesis, that Timothy McVeigh did not act alone and probably had the support of some organization, and had he offered well-organized, well-reasoned and well-supported evidence to support this thesis, this would have been a much better book.	2002-09-29

This is unquestionably the best book I have read on the subject of slavery in New York, and I've read all the books there are on the subject. (There aren't many.) White uses primary sources and original research, supplying data which our own historians have not bothered to ferret out. He gives an excellent description of the peculiar nature of the peculiar institution in New York, the different slave culture and different relationships between slaves and owners which in no way resembled that of the South.<br />Most recent books that deal with the subject of slavery in New York quote this book extensively; you might as well read it for yourself.	2002-09-26

Perhaps the most annoying aspect of reading any Spider Robinson book, including this one, is witnessing the author's total failure to understand what makes human beings tick, in spite of obvious effort to do so.<br />This book contains a chapter which formerly appeared as a short story, in which a character describes how she was raped by her father as a child. Elsewhere, in another book, Robinson remarks that the rape story was told to him \\"verbatim\\" by the actual victim, whom he would love to hear from if she's out there somewhere. That fictionalizing her childhood trauma for the entertainment of his readers isn't the best way to get in touch doesn't seem to occur to him.	2002-06-20

If you are interested in the much-neglected topic of New York's slave history, I recommend _Somewhat More Independent_ by Shane White, who examines both the legal and social aspects of New York's slave society.<br />This book is just dull. The author doesn't seem really interested in the topic. He doesn't attempt to see slavery from the slaves' point of view. He seems mostly interested in excusing New York for having been the North's largest slaveholding state; he tries to convince the reader that really it wasn't all that bad.	2002-05-06

This is the latest of several books by former cult members that I've tried to make it through. Like the others, this one is well nigh unreadable. It's written in paragraphs of equal length, contains rather a lot of exclamation points, and the most commonly used word is \\"I\\". The storyline is very hard to follow and the tone is whiny and humorless.<br />In a sense this author, like other former-cult authors, answers through her narrative voice the question of what sort of people join cults. They seem to be people who:<br />1. Believe in absolutes, in rules, and feel uncomfortable with spontaneity and choice.<BR>2. Have never learned to laugh at themselves and at human foibles; aren't able to roll with the punches.<BR>3. After they leave the cult, will look for something else to maintain a strong external locus of control in their lives, such as marriage to a controlling person, membership in a fundamentalist religion, or a strong belief in \\"fate\\" and \\"signs\\".<br />In fairness to the author, she didn't join a cult, she was born into one. Still that doesn't make this book an interesting read.	2002-03-30

The powerful imagery and great visual scenes in this book is undoubtedly what makes it so popular. But like all of Pullman's books, it suffers from egregious logical lapses and loose ends. For example, one character flees his own world because he's wanted by the police for murder: when he goes back to his world, there's no further mention of him being wanted for murder. It's never clear exactly what the two main characters did to save the world, nor why it worked. I have a list of about thirty inconsistencies off the top of my head, but listing them here might spoil the book for those who want to read it. <br />There are some great scenes. I do think, however, that Pullman needs to work on cohesion if he wants his books to survive for more than a few years.	2002-03-13

Although possible sources of strife are briefly mentioned (your parents may criticize each other, or may not know how to relate to you), others are glossed over. The book assures the child reader that both parents continue to love the child, which is warm and fuzzy but not (in my experience as an elementary teacher) always true. Unfortunately. <br />In 31 pages, children who may be just facing the bombshell news of their parents' divorce are galloped willy-nilly through the times ahead, including the possible remarriage of their parents and the advent of stepchildren. It's true this is among the range of things that may have to be faced, but other unpleasant things that sometimes have to be faced during divorce are glossed over and left out (public scenes, calls to the police, institutionalization, alcoholism...). So why drag that in at such a delicate moment?<br />I wonder if this book perhaps offers more comfort to the parents of the children it's intended for than to the children themselves.	2002-03-04

Either this book will make you very angry, or this review will.<br />This is an \\"as told to\\" story of a fundamentalist Christian father who takes away his 11-year-old diabetic son's insulin in order to demonstrate his faith that God will heal the child. (Never for a moment thinking that by making insulin available, God has already healed the child.)<br />Over the next three days, as the child rapidly deteriorates and then dies, the family and friends gather and pray louder and louder for God to overcome Satan's lies about the child's healing (Satan's lies being the child's vital signs).  Nobody calls a doctor; someone does call the police but only after it's too late.<br />The rest of the book is concerned with the trial, and with the Mistakes that the couple eventually realizes that they made.<br />The couple are arrested. They go to jail and wallow in self-pity. The jailers are MEAN to them. People are SARCASTIC. Even other Christians don't UNDERSTAND. <br />On the other hand, the narrator finds much to be smug about. The prosecutor shows up for their preliminary hearing drunk, which shows what kind of person he is. The reporters and court room observers are rude and ill-behaved. Of course, none of these people has offed a child, but hey. Christians aren't perfect, just forgiven.<br />The jury hands in a verdict of guilty, and the sentence is the proverbial slap on the wrist: five years' probation, as punishment for the death of an eleven-year-old child. God is good!<br />You keep hoping this is all going to end with the narrator experiencing an epiphany and realizing that God isn't Santa Claus and that faith doesn't excuse humans from thought and action and responsibility. But he doesn't. He comes up with a flurry of bible quotations, several pages long, all of which go to prove that he and his wife chose the wrong TIME to stop giving their son insulin; they should have waited for God to effect the healing. At no time do they realize that the insulin itself is God's healing; that many diabetics don't have access to this life-saving treatment.<br />Another point of view that is utterly missing from the book is that of the victim. The narrator whines constantly about what he and his wife had to endure: the censure of the community and even  of their own church, the hostility of the prosecutors, the humiliation of prison (for a whole week). But he never mentions his son's suffering --except as one more thing he and his wife had to endure-- or sees the child's death as a loss to the child, his life as something that was unjustly taken from him.<br />This book is pretty near the worst perversion of Christianity since the Salem witch trials.	2002-02-21

In this case it's that a weapon \\"too terrible to be used\\" would be a gun that ran on railroad tracks, since it could be used by a government against its own population. This, of course, would only work in a country where the population was too dumb to think of blowing up the railroad tracks.<br />Two of the main characters from _Ruby in the Smoke_, the preceding book, are missing without a trace and they never get mentioned. It's as if the author had broken up with them and didn't want to talk about it. The connection to the preceding book is tenuous, not to say non-existent.<br />Aside from the graphic sex which is probably acceptable in children's books these days, and the fact that all of the characters are adults and that much of the plot hinges on financial and stock market concerns, the main character loses her dog and her fiance in graphic violence. I guess that sort of thing doesn't upset most child readers, but it sure isn't my idea of fun. I really wish I'd spent the time I spent reading this book reading something else.<br />I guess the intention of the books is to mirror the \\"penny dreadfuls\\" that one of the characters is always reading. Well, the book costs more than a penny, but other than that I'd say it was a success.	2002-02-10

Substantially, I agree with the other reviewer. Sobel argues successfully that there existed in the South (at any rate in Virginia) during the Antebellum period a culture that displayed  African influences, and that these influences were visible not just among blacks but among whites, who increasingly were raised by slaves, learned to walk and talk from slaves, and in some cases were unable to function emotionally or physically without slaves.<br />What's missing from the picture is the abuse and cruelty inherent to the slave system. And, one could argue, appropriately: it's not what the book is about. My concern would be that if this were the *only* book one read about the Antebellum South, one could emerge with a skewed picture.	2002-02-07

What could be a fascinating book is ruined by the author's endless and tedious digressions, virulent anti-Semitism, and footnotes in eight different languages.<BR>(I realize the latter was something of an academic fashion at the turn of the last century. But this book was written a little late for that --1915-- and the edition I have, from 1964, could certainly have been edited if anyone cared to do so.)<br />What you hope the book will be about is the beliefs of sects related to the early Christian church, including precursors such as the Essene movement in Judaism and contemporaries like the Gnostic Christian sects. And the author probably thinks that's what he's written about. But he's writing only for a very select audience... he makes references to obscure works on early religion that he assumes his reader has read (all of them out of print for a century or so now) and makes a lot of comments about the faults of other researchers which sound more like personal vendettas than anything else.<br />The discovery and glacially slow translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls has rendered much of what Legge has to say obsolete.

It seems to go a little too far in that the author attempts to cover both people who *have* relationships but aren't  able to communicate fully with their partner, and people who haven't had  relationships for many years or have never had a relationship. And I feel  these are two quite different problems. It also deals with diverse issues  like drug addiction and memories of childhood sexual abuse... like I said,  it tries to do too much.<br />What's good in this book, if you're a person who  hasn't had a relationship in years, is that  it uncovers the lies you may  tell yourself and the games you may play to avoid being close to other  people. It also tells how to overcome these difficulties.

You have to read it, of course, because it's a  Diana Wynne Jones book, but don't get your hopes up too high. Buy the  paperback.	1999-10-17

However, much of what's presented as fact is actually the author's opinion or is not proveable at this late date, or has  been written about differently in different sources.(Example: that slave  owners usually treated slaves well.)<br />Also, it necessarily gives a very  shallow view of Colonial life, which is suited to the intent of the book  but may not be suited to your needs. If you're planning to write a  Harlequin Romance that takes place in Colonial America you can probably get  by with this. If you have in mind more of an Anya Seton approach, you will  need to do considerable research in addition to reading this book.	1999-10-02
