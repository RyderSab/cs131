That is what made that book. The plot is soild and with the colorful characters it adds such an outstanding twist to the book. I felt as if I could have sat down with Patrick Kenzie and had a beer..lol.<br /> Kenzie and his partner Angela Gennaro are private investators, hired by a senator to find a cleaning woman. Lehane did a masterful job in adding new drama and a by adding a sexual tension between Kenzie and Gennaro(whom herself has her own problems). I am looking forward to reading more from these to, Enjoy.	2004-04-14

I enjoyed the different twist in this book. Fat Ollie is the typical Columbo type cop. Ollie is portraded as a fat, bigot aspiring writer. The book is about the murder of a councilman. It seems more or less important to Ollie to find who stole his book. There are different story lines that are quite easy to follow. It was quite fun to read and guess what OLlie would do next as well as reading along Ollies' book. I read this book on my return flight from Iraq and I must say I am not much of a Crime Fiction guy but, but this was well worth the read.	2004-04-14

I have read a great deal of Mr. Adams works he is a lost treasure and I hope that you will find him and enjoy his brillance. <BR> The Outlandish Knight is the story of a minstrel who is traveling to find himself and to serve his Master. The book which is broken down in three parts. Each part pertains to a different family memeber of Raymonds.<BR>  There are great folk songs through out the book which adds to Mr Adams great writing. I enjoyed the first two parts very much following along with Raymonds son as he to follows in his father footsteps. The second part of the story is told by Raymond the son, and it gives a different feel to the book.<BR> The third part is about Raymond's daughter Honor Mary and about her story which is told by the Author. This is where the story slows down a little. Honor does not follow in their footsteps. It is still a wonderful book and it brings a very different look to Mr Adams works.It is an enjoyable book and any Richard Adams fan will enjoy it.I only wished that he would have given more feel and more color to the characters.	2004-04-14

I read this book with a very open mind and it has to read as such. It changed me and gave me a new view point on heaven and the afterlife. Eddie the main character death is the main subject of the story. His goes through five phases as I like to call it. They were life lessons, I felt  should be done while living but it took Eddie to die to learn them. Like I said you need to be very open minded to read this. It was a very easy book to read.

I am not going bore with stick to the original, I am a big fan of Mr Adams I have read seven of his works, with Tales he brings a different approach. The characters and pretty much the same. <BR> The book is broken into three parts. All which on way or another deal with the Watership warren as well as two other warrens.

It was a very awesome book. As always he has a way to bring you into his mind and into the story. I began to wonder if he was a character in the story as well, maybe Dwayne or Trout. <BR> I never read a book where the writer confronts  the main character in the book Kilgore Trout as he is writing it. It made me laugh really, if Trout was indeed Mr Vonnegut looking though a leak(mirror);lost in an endless pursuit or quest on the meaning of life. He puts alot of himself into the novel.

Well this book follows the great journey of a cat named fritti tailchaser. the writer takes us to the  adventures of this cat along with his side kicks he picks up along the way.

The pigs slowly changed their ways of thinking to better themselves. Just as we do now, and sometimes we as people forget where we came from. In a sense the pigs, became this very being. They improved everything for their ways a living. The reader will think as I did, yes it one goverment over throwing the other with its false statements to polute the minds of the week.

The book covers a small part of Operation Market, remember it is just following a plt. leader and his men. <BR>  The letters he puts in the book shed a new light on things.
