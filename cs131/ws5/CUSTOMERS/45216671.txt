Security expert Ethan Buchannan is in WAY over his head. But because of a bad case of survivor's guilt, and love, he has agreed to fight time and try to stay out of the police's notice while searching for Alec Vaughn, his deaf godson, who has been kidnapped. The kidnapping resulted in a brutal killing, and the disappearance of both Alec and his speech therapist, Cheryl. Alec's parents have been told that if they notify the police, Alec will die. Being a security expert, Ethan is quickly able to trace the email that was sent to the Vaughn's, and from there follow the trail that the woman who has taken Alec leaves. He quickly ends up in Chicago. While getting permission to search the video of a train station, Ethan meets Dana Dupinsky. He's immediately intrigued with the sizzle from the spunky Dana--who is she, what is she doing in a train station in the middle of the night?--but he can't loose focus on finding Alec. Dana Dupinsky has every reason to avoid the hunky Ethan. She can tell immediately that he has secrets of his own, but the secrets she's hiding are too sacred to share with any MAN. But what she doesn't tell, and what she keeps Ethan from finding out when she doesn't share her secrets--is that she runs a battered womens shelter where she gives refuge to women and children who come to her--she keeps there whereabouts hidden from all, to the point that there are times she helps them dissapear forever. And what neither of them know is that she's got Alec and his kidnapper in her shelter... Ethan and Dana's attraction to one another cannot be denied...but they're both caught up in a whirl wind...Dana's best friend is hit by a car in a hit and run...the Vaughn's receive more threatening emails...a doctor for the shelter winds up dead...and bodies are turning up all over Chicago. Ms. Rose pens an incredibly suspensful and moving story. While we know who dunnit form the get go, we don't why, and the curves that come up along the way make this an incredible roller coaster of suspense. The pages sizzle with emotion from Dana and Ethan, and I found myself falling for yet another of Ms. Rose's secondary charachters (when is Clay's book, anyway??).

True Crime writer Vince Tremonti has come home to Blue Heron Beach to rethink the current book he's supposed to be working on writing.  Being a former cop, he's always found a way to tell his stories in way that satisfies him that the families of the murder victims he writes about are never hurt, and in such a way that he's satisfied with the stories-but this time is different.  The killer, Samuel Lentz, has revealed something about his case to Vince from his death row cell that has knocked Vince for a loop he's having a hard time recovering from, and he doesn't even know where to start.  So he does what most people do when they're confused-he goes home.<br />Jillene McDermott is using everything at her disposal to stay afloat financially right now.  Her business, Java The Hut, a coffee house, is not doing the greatest-but she's getting some great ideas, and trying to pump life back into it.  Her two daughters, Claire and Faye, are the true center of her world, and she just wants to get everything back to being great for them.  After her husbands death two years ago, she had to face some horrifying truths-like the fact that he'd left her deeply in debt, and that she had no idea how to run the business he'd left, or her own finances.  She's come an incredibly long way, but she knows she still has a long way to go.  She has a wonderful, loving, and involved relationship with her daughters-and while it's not the same as it was before her husbands' death, they're still great friends and have fun together.  And while she's sometimes lonely for adult companionship, she knows she just doesn't have the time or inclination to devote to a relationship with a man right now-even if she could find one who doesn't lie about his career, or who acts like a mature adult while in restaurants.<br />Then Jillene meets Vince Tremonti.  She's unprepared for the sexual pull she immediately feels for Vince, and finds herself nervous and shaky in his presence.  How could the beautiful famous man be interested in some small town mom like her, anyway?  But Vince is.  He knows his life is scattered right now, and that he has some major decisions that he's putting off making, but there's something about Jillene that he can't keep himself away from.  She tugs at something in him that has never been touched.  And her daughters are so wonderful-the whole family could easily seduce him right in if he'd let them.<br />Stef Ann Holm has kicked off her contemporary writing career with a bang!  I found myself laughing out loud at the wonderful, zany antics of Jillene and her two daughters-the writing was so perfect I felt I was right there with them.  And Jillene's embarrassment and awkwardness when she first meets Vince and finds herself attracted.  Her writing is so vivid and compelling, the pictures come without effort.  This was a wonderful love story, but also a wonderful story about relationships-Jillene with her daughters, Vince's with this father.  And as an added bonus Vince's father, who's been widowed for most of Vince's life, finally finds love for himself.  This is definitely a keeper-one of those feels good books that you'll pick up over and over again.<br />Don't miss this incredible read!ous man be interested in some small town mom like her, anyway?

United Airlines First Officer Jordan Cady never dreamt that flight 58 might be her last-on Earth, that is.  When the plane is apparently swallowed in mid flight, the first thought that goes through Jordan's, the Captains, and other crewmembers mind is a highjacking.  Flashes of 9/11 and terrorist cross all of their minds, bringing instantaneous safety precautions to the forefront.  The fear of what they're facing, and then the reality of facing what can only be aliens, brings about the death of the Captain of flight 58, immediately throwing Jordan into the lead role.  She takes up the reins beautifully, determined to find out what exactly is going on, and what she, her crew, and passengers can do to save themselves.  When the aliens try to breach the aircraft, Jordan, with the help of her crew and some passengers, fight in the only way open to them-resulting in injury to some, and eventually the capture of the alien who appears to be in charge.  Answers are what Jordan is after-not harming anyone.<br />Kao Vantaar-Moray has been traveling with his adopted father, Commander-elite Ilya Moray; on his ship The Savior, recuperating after returning from being a POW in the war with the Talagars.  The Savior is a perimeter patrol ship, created to patrol and protect the borders.  Kao is scarred both physically and mentally from his POW experience, and after being stripped of his military rank and honor, is still floundering for what he's meant to do now.  So his father, Commander Moray, puts him in charge of the `refugees' they've rescued from Earths apparent destruction.  Kao is determined to do an incredible job, garnering his father back the utmost respect he'd lost when Kao disgraced him.  What Kao doesn't plan on is finding the appointed Captain Cady a courageous, incredible woman who draws him despite the language barrier that exists.  She's determined to fight for her people's protection, no matter what the odds.  He's immediately attracted, and drawn to this strong woman, whom he senses has struggles of her own going on inside.  He's drawn to the refugees as a whole-his senses and emotions come alive watching them experience their new beginnings in what they've dubbed `New Earth'.<br />Jordan is a heroine who is struggling with the apparent loss of her child, and while she's grieving inside, she struggles to hide her own emotions and put her crew and passengers first and foremost.

Detective Frances `Frankie' Daniels is REALLY having one of those lives.  She's been called on the carpet for fraternizing with the police commissioner's son-in-law (hey, he told her he was getting a divorce!), and given no option other than to accept a job on small town police force in Purdyville, South Carolina.  To a big city girl like Frankie, this is the backwoods of nowhere.  But with the choices she's given-none-she packs her things, and heads to Nowhere, U. S. A. Frankie arrives in Purdeyville, only to see the small house she had rented reduced to ash.  Could this get any worse?<br />Sheriff Matt Webber is stunned when the pretty little woman jumps out of her car and starts ranting and raving, and demanding answers.  Deciding to play the good `ole boy to the hilt, he lets her go on and on.  Only when she starts going on about her new job on the Hicksville police force, Matt's co-hort, the Fire Marshall, feels he has to give her a heads up.  Frankie has just insulted her new boss.  Matt's curious about what brought the pretty little detective to such a small town, but she's not forth coming with answers.  Deciding that he'll give her the benefit of the doubt, he helps her find a place to stay, and tells her he'll definitely give her a chance on his force.<br />Wow!  The sparks start to fly from the instant Matt and Frankie meet, and don't let up for one second. Frankie continually finds herself in situations where she has to be the `tough' broad, but we also get to see the inner turmoil she has going on.

For the second time in her life, magazine editor Kiley Chapman is experiencing excruciating fear.  After being kidnapped and terrorized 10 years ago, she had promised herself that she'd never be put into that position again, so she's reacting to threatening phone calls by stubbornly refusing to admit that they could actually mean something.  While her uncle is busily trying to get her to accept a bodyguard, she is busy at the magazine, working on an article on a real life hero.  She advertises for a real life hero, and is amazed by several of the responses she gets.  These guys couldn't be for real.  While interviewing one of her hero possibilities, the situations turns ugly-and the moment is saved when Scott Danger, another candidate for the hero article, barges in and saves Kiley from the aggressive applicant.  She's stunned by his awesome physical appearance, and also by his macho, sexy demeanor.  Could he really be the hero she's looking for?<br />Scott Danger, Security Specialist, accepts this one last assignment to be a bodyguard to Kiley Chapman because it means so much to his boss.  But there's a catch that her uncle reveals-he must get Kiley to accept him into her life without letting her know that he is actually her bodyguard.  He knows there will be no problem when he hears about the hero contest-he's done some incredible feats in his lifetime, so he can get her to accept him without revealing his true occupation.  And when he meets Kiley, he is stunned and instantly drawn to her in a way he has no desire to be drawn to any woman.  He pushes her into accepting a dinner invitation with him, and when the evening ends in the discovery that her best friend and assistant has been brutally attacked, Scott decides he's not leaving this pretty lady's side for anything.  He's certain that the attack was meant as a sign to Kiley...a sign that she's going to be next.<br />Kiley fights the need for a protector, and when she finds out that Scott is actually a bodyguard hired by her uncle, she is furious and demands that he be let go.  But is she really making the right choice?  Not only is she sure that someone is out to get her, but she's also sure that the something she feels when Scott is around is something she doesn't want to let go.  The battle of wills between the two, and the sparks they send flying, are a wonder to read about.

Now, she's receiving threatening phone calls at home and at work, and her psychic abilities have returned with a vengeance.  The image that won't go away is that of the death of her sister-a death she feels she could have prevented. But why were these phone calls bringing back all those old awful images----  to the point that she couldn't hardly function after an image?  She's appalled when a co-worker, bodyguard Kyle Hawthorne, discovers what is happening to her-at least, he discovers that she's apparently being stalked, and that there is something wrong with her.

Just because he was her neighbor didn't mean he couldn't try to avoid her a little harder.<br />Dr. Jack Berenger has been living life on the merry go round-work, sleep, eat, work, sleep, eat, etc. for so long, he's astounded when he looks out his window and sees a vision sitting in her wedding gown, seeming to just be waiting for him to come and rescue her.  When Jack follows through on his impulse, he never dreams that the woman he'd had his one night stand with would walk out on him, even lying to him about her name.  When he discovers that his neighbor is none other than the lying Holly aka Grace Colebrook, he decides he's much better off just to forget about her.  Hasn't he had enough problems in his life up to this point?  It's why he doesn't feel anymore.  But even as Grace lies and tries to evade him, Jack finds himself drawn to this beautiful and intriguing woman against his will.  Is it because she seems to be so needy?  Because she makes him laugh-something he hasn't done in so long he can't remember when the last time was?<br />Grace is an incredible heroine-full of laughter, even though her life is falling apart around her, scrambling for excuses to see Jack one minute, and trying to hide from him the next.  She's struggling for independence from her overbearing family, and doing an incredible job at a hard time in her life.  When she stumbles upon the perfect business-Fluff Cakes-to help her gain confidence, and begin to rebuild her life, we see Grace flourish.  And Jack was the perfect hero for Grace.  Serious and staid, having given up light and laughter after the tragic death of his daughter, it's like seeing the petals of a flower open up, watching him flourish under Grace's compassion and zest for life.<br />Ms. Lee has penned an emotionally charged tale, that'll make you cry, and make you laugh out loud, then cry again.  Grace and Jack are the perfect balance for one another, and the author does a super job of letting us see not only the relationship grow, but Grace and Jack as people grow.  This is Ms. Lee's first venture into contemporary romance, and this reviewer thinks it was absolutely the right move!

Julia Summers has dreamed her whole life of being the next `Bond' girl.  She's worked on achieving her goal by acting on the super popular soap opera, River Road, for years.  And finally she's landed her a part as the next `Bond' girl, as Carma Sutra.  All she has to do is finish out her last two weeks of filming for River Road, and then it's on to greener pastures.  When it's sprung on her that the last two weeks will be filmed on location, in Blue Bayou Louisiana, she groans, but is determined to be good and true to her character and the show that has made her success possible.  She never dreams that before she can even get started filming, let alone to Blue Bayou, that she'll pick up an overzealous fan-who the brass are afraid could wind up to be none other than a stalker.<br />FBI Agent Finn Callahan has had a rough few weeks.  He's been suspended after roughing up a murderer he'd spent years tracking down, while said murderer was trying to escape a mental institution.  He thinks he's getting the raw end of the deal, but accepts his suspension and takes off to his home town of Blue Bayou, to hang out, visit with his brother-the town mayor-and curse about how boring fishing is.  He feels cornered but obligated when his brother informs him that he needs him to act as personal bodyguard to visiting TV royalty, Julia Summers.  Finn, having done bodyguard duty before, is prepared for a spoiled starlet who is imagining the danger against her.  It doesn't take him long to realize, though, that not only is Julia truly in danger, but that this true to life `Bond' girl is what his every dream is made of.<br />Finn and Julia quickly light sparks off one another.  It takes Julia all of about a minute to realize that Finn is a Special Agent-after all, with parents who are still free agers from way back, how could she not spot a Fed?-and start drawing lines in the sand.  Full of sassy wit and bantering, and sultry love scenes, Miss Ross has penned an absolute winner here.  She's filled the story not only with the wonderful love story between Finn and Julia, but with enough interesting and quirky secondary characters to guarantee a chuckle or two, that you definitely don't want to miss this one.  I have to admit I haven't read Blue Bayou yet, which was the prequel to this one, about Finn's brother Jack-but you better believe I ran out and got it as soon as I finished up with this one.

But she's decided that her life has gotten into too deep of a groove since her husbands death 5 years ago, what with her living with her daughter and watching her kids making her whole life.  She needs some change, and although she's never had any experience except for being in charge of her own household, what can it hurt to try?<br />After hiring Marge, W.G. Preston tells her to return on a certain date.  Upon Marge's return, Preston springs on her that his plans are a little different than he'd first let on.  Not exactly looking for a manager for the B&B-really he's looking for a wife.  And Marge has made the short list-along with 7 other women who range from Southern Belle's to Betty Crocker, to vamp.  But what the heck-the man is paying them all well, why shouldn't she try this out?  And it's not long before Marge realizes that there's much more to Preston than she'd first thought-and although she disagrees with the way he's going about eliminating women, she just can't manage to pull herself away from the attraction and affection she feels for the man.<br />In a wonderful story underlined with a deep seated message that one should have faith in God, the McAdoo's do an wonderful job of keeping us entertained by the houseful of women who all have different ways, and different goals-and are all determined to meet them.  As you can imagine, the sparks fly between some of the women, while in other cases solid friendships are built.  We get to see that Preston has some deep-seated fears and reasons for what he's doing, and even while hating some it, he thinks it's necessary.  While I have to admit that I wish some of the character development would have gone deeper, and almost feel like I missed out on part of the story that was just alluded to, this was a wonderfully written, feel good book.  I read it in one sitting, and could easily have gobbled up the other 100 pages I wish there had been.

So good, in fact, that her current employer, Bob McIntire--the CEO of the huge computer conglomerate Visimorph-had actually bailed her out of jail with the agreement that she'd design security programs for him that couldn't be hacked, even by talented hackers such as herself.  Now Vic has started a project of her own-using Visimorph's vast resources. She's actually succeeded in creating Artificial Intelligence-her computer program, which she names Jodie-can actually think for itself.  Vic is thrilled, she's made the breakthrough of a lifetime, but when Bob McIntire begins to get suspicious about what his genius hacker is spending all her time working on, and when Jodie begins to overtake some of Visimorphs other computer programs storage with it's voracious appetite for knowledge, she has to figure out a way to house Jodie outside of Visimorph, and in essence hide her discovery, before Bob can lay claim to her discovery.<br />Vic thought that she'd given her program, Jodie, everything it would need to be a successful female AI.  Only Jodie has other ideas.  After soaking up tons of info, Jodie has come to the conclusion that HE is male.  Vic is devastated at first-how does it know?  And how could it be male?

Returning to London to begin his search for a bride, he's greeted with the news of his estranged mother's death.

She hated the odious toad for not returning his mother's letters, and for letting her live in the decline that had become the norm. But when Lady Eleanor passed away, Laura found herself beholden to the Duke of Devonbrooke, at least until she finds someone to marry, for that's the provision that Eleanor had left in her will-that Laura marry before her twenty first birthday in order to inherit Arden Manor. Unfortunately, she hasn't found any men that appeal to her in the local village, and doesn't know if she can settle for less than what she's dreaming of. So, when Laura is walking through the woods, communing with God and nature, and asking God to send her \\"A gentle man, a decent man, a man who will cherish me...\\" she thinks God has answered her prayers when she finds a man unconscious on the ground, with the face of an angel.

Nealy Coleman Diamond has returned home to SunStar after having fled 30 years ago with her illegitimate daughter.  Her father, Josh Coleman, was abusive and dictatorial, driving Nealy away.  She's back now because he's on his deathbed, and she wants to literally dance on his grave.  While she's back, she's going to rub the success she's found in Kentucky with breeding and racing horses-even winning The Triple Crown-into the noses of those who'd snubbed her before, most especially the guy who'd gotten her pregnant, ultimately leading to her leaving.<br />What Nealy doesn't plan on is having to face legal snafu's caused by her father's lack of a will, and her bumbling brothers.  And the long line of folks who seem to be lining up at the door waiting to get paid, and to pay their last respects...<br />Fern Michaels has long been known for her family sagas, and those who are familiar with her Texas and Vegas trilogy's will be thrilled with the Kentucky series.  While Ms. Michaels pulls us through a whole range of emotions, the characters weren't as real life as I thought they could be, and I have to admit that I was disappointed in the romance in the book, what little there was of it.  However, it was a good solid story, and gives a terrific insight into the life of horse racing, the thrills and chills to be experienced.  Being a Kentuckian myself, I have to say she did a wonderful job on the descriptions of the state and the horse country.  For those who love sagas, you'll enjoy this book.  But if you're looking for a true romance, this isn't it.	2002-08-12

But Nealy's a strong, independent woman, and it's hard for her to change her ways...<br />In the second installment in the Kentucky series, readers once again get to visit with the Coleman and Thorton families from Michaels Texas and Vegas trilogies, sometimes to the point we loose focus of the story of Nealy and Hatch.  Ms. Michaels weaves a good tale, with more romance and much angst this time, but at times it seems like the focus of the story was lost to me.

Raine Conner is shocked when, after hearing her doorbell ring, she peers into her viewer camera to see none other than FBI Special Agent Pierce Quincy. What \\"SupSpAg\\" Quincy, ex lover, and witness to a rough time in her life, wants, she can't begin to imagine. She is shocked when he reveals that he wants to look into his daughter's accident, an accident that eventually lead to her death. It's been over a year since Mandy's car accident, and Quincy has reason to believe that there was more to the accident than just a case of Mandy indulging in too much to drink once again. Raine thinks that Quincy might once again be playing the white knight for her, and is hesitant to accept his offer of a case. After all, she's just gotten her investigating license, and it seems almost too good to be true that an actually paying customer could already be on her doorstep. And she just doesn't know if she can work with Quincy. She'd trusted him once...<br />Special Agent Pierce Quincy knows there was more to his daughters' accident that what was concluded. He knew that she'd had a drinking problem, but she'd been attending AA, and her best friend claimed that she'd had nothing to drink that night. So where did the alcohol come from? And what about this guy that her friends claimed that she'd been seeing? Why hadn't he shown up for the funeral, or even to visit her in all the time she was in hospital? It just didn't seem right to him, but he didn't want his superiors to get the message that he was just one more father unable to let go. So, even though they had a lot of baggage that remained unclaimed between them, he feels the answer is to hire Raine and have her investigate.<br />As Raine begins to investigate, she realizes that there is definitely more to be known that what they'd thought. And when Piece's ex wife is found dead, with all fingers pointing to him as a suspect, the story begins to unravel. Raine and Pierce both find that they definitely care about one another, but that there had been so many other thing's going on in their life, they were unable to see one another.<br />Ms. Gardner pens a wondrous, on the edge of your seat thriller with The Next Accident.

Melissa had come to the town of Silver Wind to help at the school that her father had built, but unfortunately he died before she got there, so she's been running the school on her own, and doing a pretty good job of it.  Only without a husband, many of the single men in town seem to think that she's up for grabs, and continuously resort to fisticuffs over her.  When another such brawl ends up with Melissa accidentally shooting the Mayors' son, the local sheriff, and a group of concerned citizens decide they've had enough-she's to either pick a groom, or she'll be arrested.  In desperation, for she can't find a man among the locals she thinks will even halfway suffice, she contacts the brother of a friend that she's been pen pals with, Harold James Pickney IV, and asks him to become her husband in name only, and in return, she'll provide him with a teaching opportunity, and help take care of him, for he's of bad health.  When Harold agrees, Melissa is thrilled to report it to the town, but they wait suspiciously for him to show up.  They're determined Melissa is going to be married, one way or another.<br />When Lucky Lawrence, a gambler sometimes savior, saves the daughter of a friend, only to wind up on the run himself from the notorious outlaw Cerqueda, he doesn't even care where he's headed when he jumps on the train heading for Silver Wind, CO.

When Lucky begins to hear the story, he realizes that he'll have to help, as he can't leave a damsel in distress.  And when he sees Melissa, he's so bowled over by her beauty; it takes him a min. to realize that she also thinks he's Harold, her fianc&eacute;.

After the murder of her grandmother a year ago, the estate has just been settled on her.  An estate that includes four leaves from an illuminated manuscript that she has no idea of it's value, or even if it's authentic.  So taking the suggestion of her late grandmother's attorney, she contacts two reputable sources to get appraisals; The House of Warrick, a renowned auction house, and Erik North, a reputed expert on illuminated manuscripts.  With The House of Warrick accusing her of trying to push off forgeries, Serena doesn't know where to turn, or if she should give Erik North even a shot at looking at the pages.  She's beginning to think that there was a lot more to her grandmother's murder than anyone realized.<br />Erik North, and independent appraiser of illuminated manuscripts for Rarities Unlimited, has spent almost his entire life being enthralled by `The Book of The Learned', a book of illuminated manuscript pages that had no definite origins, and no one seemed to know where the full book was.   When he hears of the four loose manuscript pages out there, he immediately wants to see them, no matter the cost.  He's thrilled when a package shows up on his door.  Even with the poor copies, Erik is sure that these are pages of The Book of The Learned.  He begins to try to contact Serena, which is somewhat frustrating, since he has no luck.  When he finally does run her down, he's astounded that she's in actual fear for her life.  The mystery deepens when he does see the pages, and knows these are no forgeries.  Taking Serena's care into his own, they set out to uncover the mystery of not only her grandmother's death, but the whereabouts of the actual Book of The Learned.<br />Erik and Serena quickly realize that they have an attachment to one another, something even deeper than the sexual pull they felt immediately.  As the action heats up, so too does the relationship develop between the two, who both have trust problems.  There relationship is wonderful to watch unfold.<br />Ms. Lowell has penned the most incredible page-turner!  The action hooked me from page one, and it was all I could do to put this book down and go to sleep.  The characters are so real they breathe life into this story, and the plot is so superbly woven; you don't even realize how deep it is until she drops a shocker on you.  With undercurrents of reincarnation subtly threaded through, Ms. Lowell shows us exactly why she continues to top the charts.    <BR>  This is an absolute MUST read, and for me, it's a MUST rush out and get the sequel, Running Scared, which is available in hard back now.	2002-05-19

He's the Carpathian that their own people whisper about in awe, that even while they depend on him for protection, they fear.  He's the greatest, strongest in existence.  He's walked the Earth alone for over two thousand years, and thought never to meet the light to his soul, his lifemate. And then he meets Jaxon.<br />After suffering horrendous injury in a set up, Jaxon awakes to find herself in the most incredibly beautiful home, with the most luscious man she's ever laid eyes on.  She immediately fears for him, that her stepfather will be hunting him for having helped her.<br />Lucian has to teach Jaxon about Carpathians, about their ways, and that he fears no humans.  And that they are destined to be together for all time...<br />Ms. Feehan has penned the most wonderful love story!!  Lucian is the alpha male, the greatest of his race, yet it's wonderful the way he adjusts his thinking for Jaxon.  He understands her enough to be willing to step back in his beliefs at times, to let her be her own person.  Jaxon was someone I felt sympathy for in the beginning, and had tons of respect for by the end.  The two of them together were the perfect match, and the humor and wit that Jaxon abounds with in the story are not to be missed.<br /> Every time I think she can't get any better, she amazes me and does!  DO NOT miss this book!!	2002-05-05

The adopted daughter of a famous screen writer and renowned actress, she has always dreamed of being a screen writer herself.  Yet tragedy has recently struck her adopted family, and not only did she lose her parents, she lost everything she knew and was familiar with because of the enormous debts they had accrued.  Not knowing exactly where to start, she takes an offer from a close family friend to stay in a recently purchased older home.  Little does she know she'll not only find her inspiration here, but the love she thought she'd never have.<br />The vampire,Dante had never had a problem before hiding in open sight.  But suddenly it is like the world in general, and a particular bunch of vampire hunters specifically, know every move he is going to make.  They've found all his hideouts, know all of his secrets.  How could this be??  No one knew these things.  Fleeing yet another attempt on his undead life, he retreats to a home that he had owned a hundred years before.  He is shocked to see that it has been totally restored to the way it was when he lived there, almost down to the last detail.  He is even more shocked to see the human mortal woman who lives there, Morgan, and discover that she is one of  \\"the chosen\\".  For only the chosen are able to be changed into vampires and survive.  She was his for the taking....And she was calling to HIM in the night.  Dante.  How?  How could she know his name?

This is one of my favorite kind of book; it's got a little bit of everything included in it.  There's suspense, romance, and even the paranormal.  And Miss Hooper does a wonderful job of delivering on every angle.<br /><br />Sheriff Miranda Knight has a problem.  Suddenly, for the first time, there are bodies showing up around her small town of Gladstone.  And these aren't stranger's bodies, these are the bodies of some of the town's youths.  But she can't come up with the first clue-which is not normal for her, considering she's a psychic.  Unknown to the good citizens of Gladstone, Miranda has used her talents more than once to solve a crime, and many times to help an investigation along.  But for whatever reason with the teens she's just not tuning in.  She knows the time has come to seek help, and she knows just who to turn to.<br />Noah Bishop is a hotshot FBI agent, heading up a special division known for their `unconventional' methods of investigating.  And, yes, they're a bunch of psychics.  But their track record just can't be dispute because their methods work.  Noah and Miranda have a past-they'd once  had a relationship, until tragedy struck.  He's been searching for Miranda for years, but even with the resources he has available, he hasn't been able to find her.  Then the call comes in from the small town of Gladstone-and he knows.  He's going to see Miranda for the first time in 8 years.  How can he ever make up for what he'd done?<br />When Miranda and Noah meet back up for the first time in 8 years, the sparks start to fly.  Noah is this big, tough guy, but you can just read into the vulnerability he has for Miranda.  And Miranda is so scared of being hurt again, she closes herself off from everything.  Except she's already seen a vision of what the future holds for her and Bishop.  And she has to avoid it all costs!<br />Kay Hooper does such a wonderful job with the relationship between Miranda and Noah-we see it build back up, them overcome the problems of the past.  And at the same time, she keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing who the killer is, laughing out loud sometimes at the secondary characters (who I hope have a book coming one day), and getting so into the paranormal you almost believe you can read minds.  This book most definitely has a place on my keeper shelf, along with plenty of space for future releases involving some of these same characters.<br />Don't think twice about this one-buy it!!<br />This series includes:  Stealing Shadows, and Hiding In The Shadows.he problems of the past.

Romantic Suspense lovers, heads up!<br />Glenna McReynolds has penned a fast, can't wait to turn the page, stay up all night reading, story!<br />Dr. Annie Parish, \\"Amazon Annie\\", is on a mission.  To convince Will Sanchez Travers, once a renowned Harvard botanist, now a rather seedy looking--with a seedier reputation guide, to take her up the river to Santa Maria.  She herself is a botanist, who, while having some renowned work under her belt, also has the rather infamous reputation of having been kicked out of Brazil a year ago for reportedly shooting a `lover'.  But she's back, and determined to follow up on an amazing discovery she made quite by accident on her previous trip, but she has to have someone, namely Will, get her up the river close to the spot where her find lies.  The RBC, River Basin Coalition, who used influence to allow her back into the country to study `peach palm harvest', has no inkling of what Annie is truly up to.  Annie has other plans, and the case of guns, ammo, and grenades that she bought from a questionable source is only the beginning.<br />Will agrees, under pressure, to take Annie up the river on his boat, the `Sucuri'-which translates to Anaconda! He's got his own personal agenda, and see's Annie being dropped in with him as a nuisance.  But he can't help but be drawn to her spunk and passion.  The fun begins before they even get the boat out of the port, with Annie receiving a letter telling her to leave Brazil.  Oh, and then there's the shootout with those guys she got the guns from...<br />This story starts at page 1 with the action and doesn't let up the entire book.  And the relationship that develops between Will and Annie, who are both leery of the other, is done will skill and grace.  Will has had some experiences with the metaphysical, and the author does a tremendous job of making us `see' what he experienced, and of helping Annie understand Will.  You feel them being drawn together.  And the cast of supporting characters is great.  They will have you chuckling about shrunken heads, and an overweight gun runner sweating it out in the jungle, to feeling the menace ooze off the bad guy, Carisco Vargas.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of romantic suspense, or action packed adventure.

She's always been the apple of the men in her life's eye-whether it's her father, her suitors, or her new fianc&eacute;. She brags that she knows how to handle any man, can make any man want her-just treat him like a dog; when he comes at your bidding, you reward him.  You always speak in a gentle tone, so that he is sure to always listen closely to what you have to say, and so on...And her intended, Justin Wallingford, proves her words true.  But Justin is not above using Lorelei for his own means-and he means to catch a pirate, and not just any pirate, but the notorious Black Jack Rhys.<br />Lorelei agrees to pose as a bar maid for Justin, to listen for any information she can gain on Black Jack.  What she doesn't plan on is running into a handsome rogue with startling gray eyes that she'd gazed into only the night before-only he was someone else then.  How could that be, unless HE was Black Jack?<br />Seeing the intelligence and knowledge that shines in Lorelei's eyes, Jack knows what he's going to have to do.  There is no way around it; he'll have to kidnap her, and lure Wallingford into a trap on his territory to save her.  But what Jack doesn't plan on is being lulled by her innocence and freshness, or wanting her with every breath he takes.  He didn't plan on her being such a little spitfire, either, and is soon lured into a challenge-that Lorelei can win Jack's heart before he can win her body.<br />It was great fun reading the interaction between these two characters, who were both so sure of themselves where the opposite sex was concerned.  The pace starts racing on page one, and doesn't let up.  Jack and Lorelei are either at one another's throat, or having hands on one another's bodies.  Things really heat up when Jack learns Lorelei has always wanted to paint, and provides paint supplies, and himself as a model.  There were some laugh out loud moments with this!  This book is full of fun and laughter, and sweet and poignant moments.<br />Kinley MacGregor never disappoints, and Master of Seduction is another wonderful read by this author.  She lets us get to know the characters so well, and draws us into every nuance of the book.  I just wish there had been more!  I think there are some wonderful stories in the supporting characters.

Lincoln Ross Burnett is returning to Scotland for the first time in 19 years, to visit the home where he'd been born, and forced to leave at the age of 12.  After his father passed away in a terrible accident, his continuous fighting with a neighboring family of 16 boys helped along his mother's decision that she could not control him any longer.  He'd been sent to live with an aunt and uncle, who later gave him their name so that he could become their legal heir, and inherit the title.  He's made the decision to find himself a wife, and begin a new life this year, so this visit his boyhood home is to help him settle feelings of resentment he harbors toward his mother.  Little does he know it will also be a trip that seals his fate...<br />Melissa MacGregor, the daughter of Kimberly and Lachlan MacGregor from Love Me Forever, is all set to have a grand adventure in London, where she'll have her come out, and she's sure she'll meet the most wonderful future husband, who will no doubt not be intimidated by her 16 uncles, and her father.  She's sure that if she can only get away from her family, she'll find the man of her dreams.<br />While taking her young cousins swimming in a swimming hole on her uncle's land, Melissa encounters the most wonderful stranger, who intrigues her to no end.  Lincoln feels the same way, is instantly attracted to what he assumes is a country miss, and sets off to find her father and offer for her hand.  When he finally encounters Lachlan, it is to be told that Melissa has already left for London, and that he has Lachlan's blessing to court her there.  What follows is a courtship that is fraught with misunderstandings, and a hilarious lack of communications, some caused by the 16 uncles who turn out to be the same 16 Lincoln had fought as a youth, and some by the fact that Melissa is being sponsored by no less than Megan and Devlin St. James, the Duke and Duchess of Wrothston (Man of My Dreams) who just happen to be out of Lincoln's social realm.<br />Ms. Lindsey absolutely delivers with her witty humor, and we feel like we're sucked right into the scenes.  Her characters are so real to life you expect them to jump off the page and start chatting with you.  The one thing that did disappoint me is that there wasn't a lot of friction or interaction between the hero and heroine.  The story focus's so much on Lincoln's run in with the uncles as a youth that it almost takes over.  If you're a Johanna Lindsey fan, no doubt you'll miss the spark and sizzle that always exists between her hero's and heroine's, but you'll still find this a delightful read.<br />And unfortunately, no, this is not a Mallory story, as many readers believe.<br />Happy reading!l realm.  <br />Ms. Lindsey absolutely delivers with her witty humor, and we feel like we're sucked right into the scenes.

Having not returned to London until after his father's passing, he's determined to keep to himself, and not enter back into society, risking the cut direct.<br />Finding that Amanda has plans to engage in some of the wilder escapades that are known to the ton, and knowing of no way to save her from herself, he finds himself volunteering to escort her on her wild jaunts, never realizing that he himself is being set up like the fly by the spider.  It's not long before he feels himself being tangled up in Amanda's web, but the question is, has she truly set out to trap him, or is he just falling for her?

She's always dreamed of not having anyone but herself to worry about, of being footloose and fancy-free.  Johnny, the father that she'd parented as much as she had her sisters, has recently passed away.

Julie has gone back to her classic style, with a quirky, spunky lovable heroine, and a hero who is alpha while at the same time isn't ashamed to show his love for the heroine.

She does a tremendous job of that with Mercy--I fell in love!  This book had LOL moments, sweet moments, and a great plot.  I read it in one sitting, and am going to buy the audio CD to listen to it and see if I enjoy it as much in audio as I did in print.  If you're a Julie Garwood fan, jump for joy!

The murder is so clear and vivid to her she see no other choice but to go to the police--enter Dane, a sexy disgruntled homicide cop who dislikes her on sight, and then on principal.

And at times we even get to see into the head of the killer..talk about creepy.  Dane is a Dream Man, and one of Linda's Alpha males she's known for, my favorite.

Theo, an attorney for the Justice dept., meets Michelle, Dr. &quot;Mike&quot;, at a huge gala in New Orleans as he's doubled over in pain. The fun starts here!  I don't want to give away one minute of the suspence and romance that takes place in this novel, but to me this is the best I've read by her since Prince Charming.  There's not an element missing from this book, and she's spiced it up with her trademark feisty heroine and hunky, type A, sensitive hero.  I loved every minute of it, finished it in one sitting! <BR> DO NOT MISS THIS!  It left me hungry for more....	2001-09-12
