Set in colonial Tasmania, and told through several points of view (including first person and third person narrative, letters between a mother and daughter and dispersed with accurate newspaper accounts of the 1840's `Fox rappings'), we meet Christopher Mansel, a middle aged horse-breeder and his unhappy household. A few months previously, Mansel's wife and daughter were found bloodily murdered in the summerhouse whilst Mansel wandered the ground drunk. He cannot remember a thing about that night, only that he came to in the summerhouse covered in blood, as was his stable boy Virgil Morrisey. Now he's haunted by the tragic night, unsure of his own involvement in their deaths and mystified as to why his family was killed in the first place.<br /><br />Living a wretched half-life where his only interest is the well-being of his horses, Mansel is wandering about a fairground when he comes across a dubious diviner named Henry Jones who claims to heal all physical ailments. More to Mansel's interest though is the youth that Jones identifies as his son, a boy named Abel Hawkings and who claims to communicate with the dead. Both repulsed and fascinated by his claims, Mansel arranges a series of meetings with Abel who reveals both his powers and his tragic past - and promises to communicate with Mansel's family.<br /><br />Meanwhile - just to complicate matters - Sergeant James Riley has renewed interest in the case, and is asking several strange questions concerning their deaths. Furthermore, the correspondence between Lucy Allcot and her mother, the housekeeper at Mansel's mansion reveal more background as to the murders since both women know matters of the case and the people involved intimately.<br /><br />This simply isn't Crew's best work, though is entertaining reading throughout. Often the dialogue is stilted and comes across too much like exposition (such as the discussions of the crime) for the benefit of the reader and Mansel does so much back-and -forthing when it comes to conversations with Abel that it gets frustrating. The letters between mother and daughter often take long digressions on pointless gossip and some younger readers may be a little confused at the resolution of the entire story - I won't give it away, but there is an added \\"coda\\" of sorts that discusses Mansel and Abel's eventual fate which will make some go: \\"huh?\\"<br /><br />But Crew ingeniously leaves the crime itself partially unsolved - that is, although someone is eventually brought to justice, there is a lingering unease as to who the real culprit was. You can either look at this as an annoying red herring or as an extra mystery in tone with the Gothic atmosphere of the novel - I for one quite liked the note of ambiguity it brought to the ending. Most will enjoy this novel, but compared with Crew's other work and other mystery/supernatural YA reads in general, I have to admit I was a little disappointed.g when it comes to conversations with Abel that it gets frustrating.

US	39424751	R9JICOCQ0P0GA	0316769487	862964341	The Catcher in the Rye	Books	5	3	3	N	N	An Essential Coming-Of-Age Novel	J. D. Salinger first published this novel amidst much controversy in 1951. Deemed as one of the first books written both for and about teenagers, which ultimately resulted in the \\"young adult\\" genre, \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" was banned in most schools and still is in many cases. The protagonist is the sixteen-year-old Holden Caulfield, who narrates his own life experience of New York in the two days after he is expelled from his school. Filled with swearing, slang, teen angst and an awkward sexual encounter, the character of Holden similarly comes across as angry, embittered and frustrated, who despises \\"phonies\\" and hypocrites, cannot help exaggerating and lying, and has very low tolerance levels toward those who annoy him - basically he hates everything. The darkly funny irony is of course the plight of all teenagers - they are constantly infuriated with other people's behaviour whilst completely oblivious to their own immature attitudes.<br /><br />Yet despite Holden's angst and frustration, he still comes across as an intelligent, introspective and ultimately understandable character. Whether or not you'd like him in real life is up for debate, but for the length of the novel he serves as an interesting narrator, a voice for the teenage state of mind and a mirror to our own selves: contradictive, confused and more than a little lost.<br /><br />So what is at the core of Holden Caulfield's confusion and anger? In a pivotal moment Holden's sister Phoebe asks him what it is that he *likes*. Though he momentarily struck dumb (teenagers like him don't like *anything*!) he eventually comes to a conclusion. He misquotes a poem by Robert Burn, \\"If a body catch a body coming through the rye\\" and shares his fantasy of being this `catcher in the rye' (thus the book's title) - the individual responsible for catching children who stray too close to a dangerous cliff. It is this crucial passage that reveal the inner mind of Holden - as a teenager who longs to stay in childhood and furthermore to keep others there in a state of innocence.<br /><br />Such is Salinger's theory as to the nature of youth. Is this longing to stay young and resentment of the requirement to grow up the reason behind most teenagers' attitude problems? It's true that childhood is considered the \\"golden age\\" of life - no responsibilities, no money-concerns, no career; whereas adult life is plagued with all these things and more. It seems reasonable that the adolescent years - the transformation from child to adult - are filled with uncertainty and anger.<br /><br />Of course there's more to it than this; as Holden is removed from the state of being an 'ordinary' teenager due to the death of his younger brother Allie who he reminiscences about constantly. Holden's obsession with death is also dealt with throughout the course of the novel, from his pathetic essay on Egyptian mummies to his grotesque fascination with aged people.<br /><br />Salinger constantly plays with words and meaning; which should be explored fully by the individual reader, but I can't help but share my favourite. Because Holden is preoccupied with the onset of adulthood he is likewise drawn to the ideas of sex and the inevitable passage of time that goes with it. Therefore it is fascinating to see Salinger link Holden's awkwardness with the prostitute who keeps asking Holden what the time is with Holden's earlier chauvinist comments to his friend on whether he gave his date \\"the time (of her life)\\". Miniscule connections and links like this are littered throughout Salinger's text like gems and are immensely satisfying to find, deepening Holden's psyche and his views of the world.<br /><br />There is some recent discussion on whether or not \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is still relevant to today's readers - especially teenagers themselves. For me personally, I found no such problems. With the exception of some descriptions of clothing and music, I would not have been aware that it was set in the 1950's if I had not been told. Don't let rumours of it being outdated stop you from discovering Salinger's work, but if you really must have a more `updated' version, then I'd also recommend DBC Pierre's \\"Vernon God Little\\", which is being lauded at the 21st century's \\"Catcher in the Rye\\". I'm not decided on this claim yet, but try both novels and make up your own mind. Also of note is Mark Twain's \\"Huckleberry Finn\\", the predecessor to \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" - read it and you'll be amazed at the similarities between the two novels that seem so different at the outset.<br /><br />Ultimately it's grim, it's dingy and has most of the critism posed toward it is not for its content or language but because it does not end on a particularly upbeat or hopeful note - but then, is it Salinger's responsiblity to present a \\"phoney\\" view on life to a young audience? Or can readers (especially young ones) handle the portrayal of reality that Salinger presents? Your call.s set in the 1950's if I had not been told.

Margaret Mahy is one of the few (or perhaps the only) world-renowned New Zealand author, whose work has won many awards, as well as the Carnegie Medal for \\"The Haunting\\" and \\"The Changeover\\". As good as these books are my personal favourite is \\"The Tricksters\\", written for a slightly older audience and filled with her trademark New Zealand scenery, supernatural occurrences, family dramas and the awakening of a young person to adulthood. Older readers shouldn't be put off by the claims that this is a \\"young adult\\" novel, as any intelligent reader over the age of thirteen should experience Mahy's best work.<br /><br />The Hamilton family gather at their beach house Carnival's Hide to celebrate Christmas; parents Jack and Naomi, eldest siblings Charlie and Christobel and younger children Benny and Serena. Seventeen-year-old Harry (short for Ariadne) is smack-dab in the centre and suffers the fate of the middle-child, overshadowed by the glamorous Christabel and starved for attention thanks to the younger two. To alleviate her frustration, Harry is writing a story - a wonderful story about dangerous men and voluptuous women that she keeps secret in her attic bedroom.<br /><br />But there are other things to keep her busy, such as the added presence of Englishman Anthony Hesketh who is to share the family Christmas away from the more traditional winter holiday of his home-country and Christabel's best friend Emma and her young daughter Tibby. Furthermore, the house itself has a strange history of odd happenings concerning the drowning of Teddy Carnival years ago, and Harry herself is privy to a family secret that she knows could destroy her happy, comfortable home.<br /><br />And then three brothers appear on the scene, claiming to be descendants of Teddy Carnival and charming most of the Hamilton family. But Harry knows there is something strange about Ovid, Felix and Hadfield - something that is deeply connected to the past, the house, her own story and the dynamics of family life. But who are they really? What is this strange connection to Felix that she feels? And do Ovid's threats of ruining her family have any weight? (Watch out reading some of the other reviews, as they give away the secret behind the brothers, something that should not be known till the book reveals it).<br /><br />Like all good literature, the book is filled with many themes and meanings that demand close and attentive reading. Mahy's language is dense and poetic (reminding me a little of Diana Wynne Jones's adult novels) which involves full participation from the reader to understand what's going on, and will probably require more than one reading to fully appreciate the layering and clue-sprinkling that Mahy spreads throughout the novel. The growth from childhood to womanhood, the power of imagination and storytelling, the secrets and inner-dynamics of a family, the meeting of the supernatural and the mundane, and a creepy ghost/murder mystery - all this is packed into this immensely rich and intriguing novel.<br /><br />Hopefully this won't come across as an insult to the other reviewers, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that so many of them were non-New Zealanders. When you come from a country that has so few authors of its own, ninety-nine percent of your reading list are from authors overseas and you never really expect your own country's books to be read anywhere other than in New Zealand.

After her uncle dies, Jane Eyre is grudgingly raised by her aunt (bound unwillingly by a promise made to her husband), in a home where she's constantly reminded of her inferior birth, orphaned state and dependence on her relatives. To top it off, she is of unremarkable appearance and is as poor as a church mouse.  Yet there is something in Charlotte Bronte's protagonist that sets her apart from the rest of the world, a sense of self-worth and self-discipline that gives her strength and resilience against the many hardships that she'll face in her lifetime.<br /><br />Charlotte Bronte's story begins with Jane as a young girl, living unloved and neglected amongst the untouchable splendour of Gateshead and the Reed family. Jane's only escape is in her love of books and learning, for her spiteful aunt and cousins have no control over the power of her mind - though reading must be done on the sly as John Reed will stoop so far as to deprive her of books he has no interest in himself. When such an event occurs, Jane summons up the spirit to defend herself against her cousin and is duly punished for it. Estranged from human company, her aunt orders her locked in the red room, the chamber in which her uncle dies and which holds imaginary horrors for Jane. This terrifying experience is the catalyst of her childhood which will be remembered in all frightening and unnatural occurrences henceforth in her life.<br /><br />Relief from her extended family comes only when she is called away to school, and despite the poor living conditions and the zealous religious restrictions of Lowood School's patron Mr Brocklehurst, Jane finds a new outlook on life through her somewhat sentimental friendship with the pious Helen Burns. Amazed at Helen's patience and resilience with teachers that constantly heckle and beat her, Jane discovers Helen's devotion to God which puts to shame her own practice of fighting back at those who wrong her. An important stage in her inner growth, Jane takes upon herself Helen's teachings, survives illness at the school and enters the world as a governess.<br /><br />It is here that the story begins proper (not that the proceedings are unimportant), as Jane takes up a governess position for the young ward of Mr Rochester at Thornfield, stretching her wings for the first time. Here she befriends the elderly housekeeper Fairfax and her young charge Adele, and finally comes to meet her master, the intimidating and elusive Mr Rochester. Sharing a prickly and awkward acquaintance at first, Rochester soon recognises the intelligence and wittiness hiding behind Jane's modesty and plainness. Respect turns to friendship, and from there comes the first inklings of love...<br /><br />But something is amiss in Thornfield in the novel's most overtly Gothic thread. Jane becomes increasingly aware of sinister goings-on in the house: mad laughter rings throughout the halls at night. Mr Rochester's bedchamber is set alight and only Jane's quick action saves him from death. A stranger arrives at the house whose presence upsets Rochester and who is found badly wounded that very night. Jane suspects the quirky housemaid Grace Poole, but ultimately this mystery has a far more devastating answer, which once more upturns Jane's life and ambitions.<br /><br />Charlotte Bronte's heroine is one of literature's most unique and introspective characters; an ever evolving and maturing individual, who constantly searches her soul and conscious for meaning and identity. Jane's self control is remarkable, as his her ability to rationalise problems and follow through with the decisions that she makes. By today's standards, where self-indulgence and reward-systems are the norm, Jane's state of mind is like a bucket of cold water over the head. When the moment of Jane's great choice comes, she reacts exactly as should be expected, not as some overly-virtuous, too-good-to-be-true Victorian girl. Unlike other heroines, who might be repulsed or frightened at Rochester's offer, Jane is very sorely tempted. It is from herself and the knowledge of her own weakness that she flees, not from Rochester and his pleas. In this moment the strength of her conviction and will-power is sure to impress.<br /><br />It is important to know that this is not just a romance novel, though it is certainly the driving force of the latter half of the novel. What is most fascinating about the relationship between Jane and Rochester is the complex power struggle that goes on between them, something that often does away with romantic disillusions and deals with the practical and often uncomfortable components of attachment. Mr Rochester is Jane's employer, her social superior and a man considerably older than our teenage protagonist, yet Jane is constantly attempting to exert a sense of control over him and her feelings for him, knowing the cost that would come in succumbing to the man she describes as nearly taking the place of Almighty God in her estimation. The games they play with each other, the testing and the intrigues formed between them are riveting stuff and explore the darker power-struggles of male and female relationships that are almost always lost in typical romance novels. Bronte creates an astonishing amount of equality between the two lovers, for as the novel progresses Rochester becomes more and more reliant on Jane.<br /><br />Jane Eyre is in many ways a feminist novel, addressing to its contemporary audience the drudgery and monotony of female existence that \\"confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags\\". Jane's `adventures' through school and into the world of employment, her experiences of passionate love and destitution in the wilderness, reflect Charlotte Bronte's own struggles in a man's world. Most (if not all) of the men that Jane meets in her travels attempt to control her in one way or another, and Jane is constantly fighting to walk her own path. As she says at the crucial point in her life: \\"I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.\\" The loneliness apparent in this passage, and the aloneness in which she spends most of her time is what makes the character of Jane so memorable - here is girl that has no one to look out for her but herself, and yet she keeps her kindness, faith and honour without falling into self-pity or bitterness.<br /><br />\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those classic books that everyone's heard of - but it's up to you to take the next step and read it for yourself.ochester's offer, Jane is very sorely tempted.

I am equally certain however, that only a very small percentage of these people have actually read Jonathan Swift's satirical novel, first published in 1726. If you consider yourself a serious reader, then \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is essential reading, one of the many classic novels that you simply *have* to read before you die.<br /><br />Divided into four parts, \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is presented as the historical memoirs of Lemuel Gulliver who narrates his strange adventures in undiscovered countries. In doing so, Swift explores and satirises almost every conceivable issue important in both his time and in ours: politics, religion, gender, science, progress, government, family and our basic ideas of defining humanity. As well as this, the novel is full of wonder and humour (some of it bordering on the vulgar!) and Swift's exploration of imaginary societies and countries is satire at its peak - no one before or since has reached Swift's mastery of this style.<br /><br />Some of the more direct parodies concern people and events that have long since passed away, and as such an index or extensive background is required in order to fully understand the allusions that Swift is making. However, a far larger portion of the text discusses issues that are still relevant to today's readers, especially in the responsibilities of power and the limits to technological/scientific progression.<br /><br />Part One: \\"A Voyage to Lilliput\\" is the most famous segment of the novel, and the context of the afore-mentioned \\"hostage episode\\".  After taking leave of his family and country, Gulliver is washed up on the shores of an island inhabited by humanoid beings not more than six inches tall. Though at first suspicious, Gulliver soon earns the trust of the Lilliputian people who enlist their newfound giant in defending them from their enemies on the bordering island of Blefufeu - who likewise are desperate to use the giant in their war against Lilliput. Hmm, a squabble over what is considered a weapon capable of mass destruction. Sound familiar? This ability to place modern day references over older texts and their meanings is what separates literature from books - universal themes and concerns that do not age with time.<br /><br />In Part Two, Gulliver reaches the polar opposite of Lilliput in \\"A Voyage to Brobdingnag\\", a country of giants where he becomes the helpless victim of a greedy farmer who exploits his diminutive stature to his own advantage. Displayed as a freak of nature, the tiny Gulliver is forced to perform circus tricks till he finally comes into the care of the royal court. Despite being cared for by the gentle farmer's daughter Grildrig, Gulliver has to survive wasp-attacks, hungry cats and a malicious dwarf before he is finally seized by a hunting bird and set adrift at sea.<br /><br />One of the most appealing things about Gulliver's travels in both Lilliput and Brobdingnag is the disorientation he feels on re-entering the company of humans of a normal stature - each time they seem either too small or too big and Gulliver is constantly slouching or tip-toeing in an attempt to reconcile his body to what his mind tells him he should see. The best part is that we share this confusion with him, as we ourselves become accustomed to life in the tiny and giant worlds.<br /><br />Part Three is the least known of the four parts, and for those who have read the novel, the least popular. I consider this unfortunate as it is more full of variety and wonderment than the other segments, contains some of his sharpest parodies and is my personal favourite `voyage' in the novel. Titled \\"A Voyage to Laputa, Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Gluggdubdrib and Japan\\", it is easy to see that it this episode is filled with Swift's most creative inventions. It is here that Gulliver discovers a floating island, a race of immortals, a university in which they attempt to discover the answers to all things and an island of spirits who summon historical figures up out of the past. With everything from inward-eyed people to Alexander the Great to exploding dogs, Part Three has it all.<br /><br />Finally, in Part Four, the novel reaches its most critical and thought-provoking statement on humankind in \\"A Voyage to the Country of the Houyhnhnms\\". Gulliver reaches a country inhabited by a remarkable race of horses with the intelligence of humans - perhaps with even *more* intelligence than humans. Also living here is a disgusting race of beings known as \\"Yahoos\\" - filthy, greedy, slothful, lecherous creatures who embody every vice known to mankind - and who are suspiciously humanoid in shape and form. Gulliver is faced with a crisis of the soul: does he really come from the race of Yahoos? Will the Houyhnhnms accept him as one of their own or as a Yahoo? And how can he ever return home with the devastating wisdom he has gained? Swift presents a fascinating study on the dark side of humanity and the nobility of animals in the climax of the novel that is the most controversial, the most studied and the most memorable.<br /><br />\\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is not an easy book to read; like all older literary novels it requires the attention and patience of the reader, has complicated and contemporary issues to discuss and a tendency to be a bit long-winded at times. But regardless of this, \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is a fascinating and enjoyable read and one of those books that just *has* to be read during your lifetime - if not for any other reason but to say that you *have* read it. Though the scanty amount of reviews on this page is disheartening, \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is a must-read, pure and simple.<br /><br />I also recommend the Hallmark adaptation of Swift's novel - NOT to be watched instead of reading the book, but as a surprisingly faithful and intelligent miniseries that accompanies the novel well.ons.

Out of all Jane Austen's wonderful novels \\"Mansfield Park\\" is perhaps her most widely-debated. With a heroine who triumphs through her utter passivity, uncomfortable themes of familial power and corruption, and sub-text on slavery, it is rightfully described as \\"Austen's most complex and profound *and* her least likeable novel.\\" As well as this is Austen's own declaration that \\"Mansfield Park\\" was her favourite work. To say it is unique is an understatement.<br /><br />Fanny Price is only a child when she is sent from her impoverished home to live with her aunt at the grand Mansfield Park. A quiet child, Fanny is overwhelmed by her wealthy and privileged family and is painfully homesick - a condition that the Bertrams cannot possibly understand. Hasn't she been removed from a life of near-squalor and no prospects? But the noble-yet-cold Sir Thomas Bertram, his child-like wife Lady Bertram, his self-centred eldest son Tom and his daughters Maria and Julia are not cruel to Fanny in the way that the evil step-family was cruel to Cinderella - simply misguided and so removed from her situation as to not understand the first thing about her. But from her second aunt, the loathsome Mrs Norris, Fanny receives only criticism and thinly-veiled scorn. Only the youngest son Edmund, with ambitions to become a quiet country clergyman, shows genuine compassion and sympathy to her, and soon the cousins are as close as siblings.<br /><br />Fanny grows into a young woman, but keeps her timidity - which hides a bright mind and a clear sense of right and wrong. From London come the glamorous Crawford siblings - the rakish Henry Crawford who shamelessly flirts with Maria, even though she is engaged to one Mr Rushmore, and the witty Mary Crawford, who soon captivates Edmund. This is much to Fanny's heartbreak since she has been secretly in love with Edmund for years, and she cannot help but distrust the dazzling Crawfords.<br /><br />It is not an understatement to say disaster strikes when Mr Crawford proposes to Fanny, as for her the attentions of such a man are utterly unwelcome. Unwelcome suitors are standard fare in Austen's previous novels, such as Mr Collins to Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Elton to Emma Woodhouse, but here the situation takes on a darker tone. Firstly, because Austen's previous uses of this plot-turn are usually played for laughs with the suitor as a comical buffoon, and second because her heroines are well able enough to reject such men. For Fanny however, the experience terrifies her and one can feel her distress and conflict as her family pressure her into marriage against the utter conviction of her heart. Like a bird in a cage, Fanny is completely helpless.<br /><br />Austen is renowned for poking fun at contemporary issues with her ingenious wit, and \\"Mansfield Park\\" is concerned with the disillusions of the upper-class: the belief that superior educations, convenient marriages, good manners and breeding and sparkling wit automatically make a morally good person. As such, whilst the Bertram family live their lives with the complete assumption that they are decent people, Fanny's modesty and self-discipline ensures that her character is superior to each and every one of them. The saying \\"the moment you believe you are a worthy person is the moment you cease to be one\\" caters nicely to Austen's ideal, and her general themes of conservatism, modesty and quiet reflection.<br /><br />All of Austen's heroines are diverse in a central, particular way. For instance, Emma of \\"Emma\\" is the only one removed from the pressure of making a financially secure marriage, whilst Anne of \\"Persuasion\\" is the only one who is at a more mature age than the others. In this way, all of Austen's novels have a unique individual young woman as its protagonist. And so what is Fanny Price's particular trait? You may think that it is her timidity, but more surprising is the fact that Fanny is completely infallible. Throughout the course of the story Fanny's judgement never falters, nor is she ever once proved incorrect. She is a positive angel, and as Edmund says at one point: \\"We have all been more or less to blame... every one of us, excepting Fanny.\\"<br /><br />As well as this, Austen turns her eye onto the topic of family and home-life, in a particularly bittersweet way. Fanny continually suffers from displacement - first at Mansfield Park, and later in the novel when she returns to her family home in Portsmouth to find it is not the idealistic family home she half-remembers. It is a poignant, but too-often true sensation that many contemporary readers may relate to: the return to your childhood home only to find that it isn't really \\"home\\" anymore.<br /><br />In this Penguin Classics edition, Kathyrn Sutherland and Tony Tanner provide excellent Introductions/Appendixes to the work. Even if you usually skip over these sorts of things, I highly recommend taking the time to read them, as Tanner in particular sheds new light over several episodes in the novel: for example the metaphorical connotations in the family's walk through Rushmore's gardens, and the foreshadowing prevalent in what appears to be a simple game of cards.<br /><br />Despite its controversy, \\"Mansfield Park\\" is perhaps my favourite Austen novel (I still haven't read \\"Northanger Abbey\\", so I can't truthfully make that claim yet) and though Fanny is not as spunky or spirited as many readers would like or are used to, it is actually quite refreshing to have a shy and introverted protagonist who wins the game of life; who advocates the real importance of morals and goodness.

All the wizards have long since departed this land for Vale Innis - but one has been left behind. When Mallory's favourite oak tree is felled, she finds a surprising discovery inside: an old wizard named Arbican who's desperate to follow his fellow wizards across the sea. The orphaned Mallory has grown up with stories of magic and enchantment, and couldn't be more delighted with the discovery - especially if there's a chance that she can go with him. Mallory does not have the most wonderful life as scullery maid to the nasty Mrs Parsel, but Arbican has bigger problems: his magical powers have been severely depleted, and if he does not reach Vale Innis soon he faces imminent death.<br /><br />It sounds like another wonderful Lloyd Alexander story, but sadly \\"The Wizard in the Tree\\" falls short on several levels. It is a very slim novel, and so does not have time to delve very deeply into character or plot development - instead the story is made up of Mallory and Arbican running from various members of the neighbourhood who are intent on exploiting Arbican and harming Mallory. This complete lack of likeable secondary characters is surprising for Alexander, since friendship and teamwork is a major theme of many of his other books (particularly his beloved \\"Chronicles of Prydain\\"). Although Mallory is a spunky young heroine, Arbican is not as easy to like. He's bad-tempered and arrogant, faults that are not balanced or made endearing with the inclusion of more likeable traits. The more intriguing magical elements of the plot are overshadowed by the sinister designs of the corrupt Squire Scrupner who is too much of a one-dimension villain to be particularly interesting (a greedy land-developer who's out for all he can get). There's also some surprisingly strong language: Mallory is called \\"slut\\" throughout the novel by various characters.<br /><br />Alexander also adds a general theme of environmentalism and love of country-side that is much akin to Tolkien's use of the topic with his Ents versus Saruman subplot. However, his general setting of early 19th century countryside, with rustic occupations and dialect is quite appealing, and his commentary on the true nature of magic is thought-provoking (though sadly there's not enough of it).<br /><br />Laszlo Kubinyi provides simple, but lovely illustrations that portray Mallory particularly well and capture the time-period of the story in the clothing and hairstyles of the characters.<br /><br />Ultimately, it is a harmless enough story, but is simply not up to the exceptional standards of other Lloyd Alexander publications.the topic with his Ents versus Saruman subplot.

Smith's fantasy/horror series \\"The Night World\\" deals with the existence of a secret society of witches, vampires and shape shifters, and how they interact with the inhabitants of the human world. Although humans have long since gained superiority in the world over the \\"Night World\\" minority, the supernatural creatures treat humans with distain and prejudice, often calling them \\"vermin\\" and plotting ways in which to regain power over the world.<br /><br />As such, it is fine for Night World inhabitants to deal with humans in whichever way they please as long as 1. Humans never find out about the Night World and 2. They are never fallen in love with. As the introductory page in every books proclaims: \\"These are stories about what happens when the rules get broken.\\"<br /><br />The summer holidays are beginning, and teenager Poppy North is looking forward to hanging out with her twin brother Philip and best friend James Rasmussen. Then disaster strikes - she collapses, is rushed to hospital and diagnosed with cancer. The prognosis is terminal and the cure doesn't exist... and she doesn't have much time left.<br /><br />Her family are devastated but James is in a frenzy - because he thinks he knows of a way to save her. Unbeknownst to Poppy all this time, James is a vampire and knows that a sure-fire way of saving her is to turn her into a vampire like him. There are several problems however: her family for one thing, and the underlying Night World laws that strictly forbid such involvement in human lives. Poppy would not only have to hide from her own family, but the Night World as well - and does James really want to give her a life of such isolation?<br /><br />But when Poppy finds out, she makes the decision: she wants to live and she and Phillip prepare for her death and resurrection. The bulk of the storyline is concerned with this detailed process of becoming a vampire which is described in technical rather than mystical tones, told from the three conspirators point of view: James, Phillip and Poppy. The third act is devoted to Poppy's new life as a vampire and her displacement within the world - discovering James has endangered himself for her sake, she decides to take off on her own...but can she manage her new life as a vampire and the new dangers it possesses?<br /><br />\\"Secret Vampire\\" is an entertaining enough read, but certainly not the best of the \\"Night World\\" series. Poppy is not L. J. Smith's strongest heroine (at some points she's extremely annoying) and the story itself often goes off onto several tangents with poor reasoning and illogical decisions from many of the characters. And of course, the forced happy-ending is a little hard to swallow - it would have been more poignant if everything wasn't tied up in a neat little bow.<br /><br />It is not quite the strong beginning that it should have been for the first book in the series, but still a promising one, with a lot of potential for later books. The general premise of a Night World is an intriguing one (especially for the pre-teen audience that they are intended for) and the books get infinitely better as the series goes on. Right from the very beginning Smith introduces minor characters that are later used as protagonists in later installations; namely Ash Redfern and Thea and Blaise Harman. Poppy and James themselves turn up again in \\"Soulmate\\" as part of a Circle Daybreak meeting.<br /><br />Sadly, the \\"Night World\\" series has never been completed, as the last book \\"Strange Fate\\" has not yet been published - something that may make you reluctant to begin this series. However, although the major story-arc is never completed, each book does stand on its own as a separate story and make good \\"holiday reads\\" (books that don't require too many brain cells and are easily entertaining).e conspirators point of view: James, Phillip and Poppy.

It may help slightly if you have read Pierce's previous \\"Song of the Lioness\\" quartet, but certainly not necessary - I didn't get round to reading it until several years later. \\"Wild Magic\\" is the first book of \\"The Immortals\\" quartet, and in my opinion, the best series of stories that Pierce has to offer, placing her immensely likeable heroine Daine amidst a backdrop of magical upheaval, the threat of war and Daine's own mysterious and tragic past. That Pierce manages to meld this huge range of subjects into a coherent whole is amazing - that it is set in a fantasy world that reads as a realistic place makes it even more remarkable.<br /><br />Daine is a thirteen-year-old orphan, harbouring a dark secret, that joins up with Onua the horsemistress to take ponies across the borders to the kingdom of Tortall. Although Daine doesn't have the magical \\"Gift\\" that many other people possess, she does have what she calls \\"a knack with animals\\" that allows her to communicate on a deeper level with animals of all kind, a magical trait she soon finds is called \\"Wild Magic\\". As the two women begin their journey they are soon beset by a range of dangers: monsters that have not been seen in thousands of years have suddenly been released back into the human realms where previously they had been locked up in the Divine Realms. After a run-in with a flock of hideous half-human, half-steel winged birds the women rescue a strange black hawk that has a very odd effect on Daine's magical abilities.<br /><br />Though I won't give away the twist in the tale concerning the bird, I will say that its presence causes much concern for the Tortallians, for it is just another piece of evidence that the mighty conquering empire of Charthak, lying just beyond the Inland Sea, has set its sights on Tortall. When Alanna's home Pirate's Swoop is placed under siege, it would seem that Daine alone can use her Wild Magic to save her newfound friends and home.<br /><br />\\"Wild Magic\\" is chocka-block full of every possible scenario you could think of, from dragons and griffins, to war barges and sea battles. Daine's Wild Magic is instigated in the most ingenious ways to fight the marauding pirates, and her own training on using and controlling her magic is a task that Pierce nicely draws out throughout the novel (harking back to Alanna's own knight-training in the previous quartet). There are appearances from old familiar faces, and one might be delighted that both Thayet and Alanna now have children of their own, but the new cast are fascinating: Cloud, Numair, Onua - they're all wonderful, colourful, well-drawn characters.<br /><br />Although the main secret to Daine's dark past is revealed by the end of the book, readers know that there is more to come that even she isn't aware of. Guided by the gruff silver-clawed Badger, and haunted by dreams of a strange horned man, readers should have the next book \\"Wolf-Speaker\\" on hand in order to find out more.<br /><br />For many years now Pierce has been writing wonderful books, and it is easy to spot why her books are so popular: not only is her fantasy realm colourful and magical, with intriguing plots and incredibly vivid, likeable characters, but the books feel very *real*. All of her magical components have rules and limits, and there is a sense of both history and politics to the world. As well as this, there is subtle mention of the daily necessities of people that other fantasy novels pretend don't exist: human beings in Pierce's books eat, sleep, go to the toilet, and (if they are a woman) have their monthly bleeding. It sounds silly to mention, but all of the above detail make Pierce an author worth exploring, who has managed to create a world as interesting and complete as Middle-Earth, Narnia, Prydain, the Old Kingdom (Garth Nix) and Phillip Pullman's alternate worlds - I only wish the books werelonger! Forget the fantasy imitators - Pierce is the real thing.rs - Pierce is the real thing.	2005-07-01

Keladry of Mindelin (or \\"Kel\\" as she's better known) has finally completed her page training, passed her exams and conquered the ongoing bullying that's plagued her since she first signed up to become a Lady Knight. Now that she is a squire, she's eager to begin her duties under a knight of the realm - and is shocked and awed when Raoul of Goldenlake offers to take her on. Anyone who has read the \\"Song of the Lioness\\" quartet knows how much of a legend he is in Tortall. Soon the two are a close knit-team, as Kel accompanies him to bandit-raided villages and centaur populated lands. Soon she's learning through experience, with the grim realities of living rough and dispensing justice to criminals becoming an everyday occurrence - and there's still the same old prejudice against a female squire.<br /><br />As the book progresses, Kel comes up against many varied obstacles, such as becoming a foster-mother for a baby griffin, accompanying the court on a Grand Progress through the kingdom for the benefit of Prince Roald's fianc&eacute;e Shinkokami, dealing with her romantic interest in fellow-squire Cleon, and jousting with the many men that challenge her to the competitions. And for those readers that are familiar with how squires ultimately become knights, there is the Ordeal waiting for Kel at the end of the year; something that has already destroyed two young squires...<br /><br />This third instalment in \\"Protector of the Small\\" is an interesting enough read, but there are some problems with the structure of the overall series. Though you could argue that Tamora Pierce is simply following a real-life scenario (and is therefore to be recommended), it feels that often certain plot threads and intrigues are forgotten, or brought to empty conclusions. For instance, one growing subplot involving Kel's crush on her best friend Neal is dropped halfway through the novel. Kel's relationships to her two main nemesis's (Wyldon and Joren of Stone Mountain) are ignored, leaving us feeling as through she's never really managed to triumph over them - and Joren in particular comes to a surprising end. A new rivalry with one of Raoul's servants Lerant begins, but again is dropped midway through the book.<br /><br />As I said, these could all be taken as natural and realistic conclusions (after all, real life doesn't work out as neatly as books usually do), but there was a sense of things building up in the previous books that make it seem as if Pierce has lost direction. The lack of the good-versus-evil theme in \\"The Song of the Lioness\\" and \\"The Immortals\\" quartet is because the books are more concerned with Kel's personal growth and challenges - but because I don't like Kel half as well as I liked Alanna and Daine, I can't quite bring myself to care as much.<br /><br />But on to the better things: any one knowledgeable about the community of Tortall will be pleased to know that there are plenty of appearances from older characters, especially Daine and Raoul: Raoul in particular takes centre-stage after Kel herself, and there is a surprising twist concerning him and Buri! Peachblossom, Jump, Lalasa, Neal and Kel's sparrows all return, though have considerably less to do this time around. And you finally discover the identity of Kel's anonymous benefactor is (as if it wasn't obvious from the beginning!)<br /><br />\\"Squire\\" ends on a note of both hope and foreboding, with a vision granted to Kel that will undoubtedly come into play in the forth and final book \\"Lady Knight\\"...feeling as through she's never really managed to triumph over them - and Joren in particular comes to a surprising end.

Probably Never Will..."	\\"Wolf Star Rising\\" (also published as \\"The Wolf Star\\") is the second of four books known as the Claidi journals, stories told in the format of a diary by the young escaped-slave Claidi and her travels throughout a fantasy world in search of her origins and a home of her own. In the first installment \\"The Wolf Tower\\", which you really must read if you want to understand what's going on in this story, Claidi escaped the confines of the House with the handsome Nemian, only to find that his intentions for her were less than honourable. Taking her to his dismal city and the matriarch Ironel, Claidi found that the inexorable Law of the Wolf Tower made her the new distributor of the cruel and unnecessary rules that governed the land.<br /><br />Destroying the mechanisms that put the Law in place, Claidi made her escape with the handsome bandit-leader Argul - her betrothed. At the beginning of this new part of her diary, Claidi is immensely excited about her approaching wedding to the man she loves, and her acceptance into the extended family of the Hulta. But as she prepares on the wedding day, a catastrophe occurs - she is kidnapped by men of the Wolf Tower in a great balloon, and taken across the sea to a strange place known as the Rise. With only clockwork figurines for company, Claidi desperately searches for a way to escape the confusing and dangerous moving rooms of the Rise, a huge palace and garden carved into the side of a great cliff.<br /><br />Soon she discovers that she's not alone - the Rise is the home of the elusive and confusing Prince Venarion (or Venn for short), who is just as bewildered at Claidi's presence in his home as she is. Abandoned by his mother Ustareth at a young age, Claidi suspects that somehow she is connected to the events that are now unfolding: the hidden designs of the House and the someone who has plans for them both without either of them knowing, someone who mysteriously signs their letters as \\"we\\", and who has a secret agenda going on. Wanting only to uncover the mystery of the higher interest in her, and to return to her beloved Argul, Claidi talks Venn into undertaking a trek deep into the Rise to find the library - the one place where they might both find the answers they're looking for.<br /><br />Unfortunately in continuing the story, Tanith Lee raises more questions than answers, and many of her ideas come across as confused and contradicting. She possibly has a master-plan in mind for the completion of the story and the unfolding of the mystery, but she is unravelling it in a very muddled way - it's almost as if she's making it up as she goes along and later figuring out how all the clues fit together, rather than the other way around. Despite this however, the characters, the story and the mystery of Claidi's role in the world is interesting enough to keep one reading.<br /><br />There are also complaints concerning the setting of the book - \\"The Wolf Tower\\" was a journey that took place over a large area, whilst here Claidi is stuck almost entirely within a single house. Granted, it is an exceptionally fascinating house, with moving rooms and clockwork servants, but much of the appeal of the first book was the scale and freedom of Claidi's travels. Here, that is gone.<br /><br />But \\"Wolf Star Rising\\" is a good follow-up to the previous book, and most will be interested enough in picking up the next one \\"Wolf Queen,\\" even though I am always frustrated at writers/publishers that split books into more than one volume needlessly.

In recent years there has been a massive increase in the publication of re-told fairytales and mythologies, usually with the author twisting the known facts and meanings of the original source material into something more contemporary: villains become sympathetic characters, we see the proceedings through the eyes of a minority group such as a slave or a female, or hidden agendas and meanings are revealed behind the bare-bones of the story.<br /><br />Famous examples of this have been Marion Bradley Zimmer's \\"Mists of Avalon\\", Gail Carson Levine's \\"Ella Enchanted\\" and any of Donna Jo Napoli's wonderful canon of reshaped fairytales. Patrice Kindl takes a similar path with \\"Lost in the Labyrinth\\", a retelling of the Theseus and Minotaur myth, and though she is not quite as successful as the above-mentioned authors, she still gives us an interesting and sometimes haunting read.<br /><br />The original myth took place entirely on the island of Minos, where twelve young Athenians were taken each year in order to be sacrificed to the vicious Minotaur, the offspring of a bull and the goddess-cursed Queen Pasiphae. King Minos was disgusted by his Queen's bestiality and the sight of her son, and so employed the inventor Daedalus to design a labyrinth in order to hide this Minotaur, and sacrificed the Athenians to it in order to keep it under control. Finally, Prince Theseus of Athens came to the island, and with the help of the king's daughter Ariadne he slew the monster and made his escape.<br /><br />This story however, though it keeps all the basic facts, changes the meaning and reasoning behind these events. It is told in first-person by Princess Xenodice, who is satisfied with her lot in life: helping at the menagerie, enjoying the comforts of palace life and in love with Daedalus's son Icarus. But changes are brewing for Xenodice when a ship bringing the latest group of Athenians comes ashore, bringing with them Prince Theseus who is eager to continue his heroic feats by slaying the Minotaur.<br /><br />But the Minotaur - or Lord Asterius as his family call him - is not the monster that the Athenians have longed believed him to be. The boy with the bull's head is not a monster, but rather a docile beast that is dangerous only when provoked and Xenodice is very fond of him. Concerned for his safety Xenodice does all in her power to protect the ones she loves when she discovers her elder sister Ariadne is in love with Theseus and there is a plot afoot to topple the royal prince.<br /><br />Despite all the changes from the original source, Kindl falls to a new set of clich&eacute;s that abound in this new genre. Starting with \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" is this constant trend of presenting ancient societies as matriarchal utopias, where the women are in charge. Not only is this historically incorrect, but the fact is that all the darker components of the myth are \\"sanitised\\" in order to fit into this New Age idea of ancient civilisation. For example, the Minotaur in Kindl's retelling is a creature who owes its existence to the will of the Goddess and the mythic figure of \\"the Bull of the Earth\\", not a potent symbol of the animalistic side of man. The Athenian sacrifices are brought to the island simply to tend to the royal family rather than sacrifices. The continued imprisonment of Daedalus and Icarus is based on a technicality rather than suspicion and jealousy. The sinister curves and twists of the labyrinth is now the ancestral palace of the royal family. In other words, all the juicy bits have been removed! There's nothing wrong with changing myths in order to find a deeper meaning to them, but often it felt that Kindl simply catered to a New Age ideology that brings no deeper resonance to the story.<br /><br />However, all this is just my personal opinions on what myths mean and how they should be retold, and most young readers will be delighted with this retelling. Kindl's details of the particulars of Minoan life are detailed andrealistic, and the labyrinthine palace with its luxurious baths and dark prisons come to life on the page. Her characterisations are thoughtful, with no true heroes or villains, and she brings touches of intrigue to the tale, such as Xenodice's vision of Ariadne, the resurrection of Glaucus, or her haunting last paragraph. If you are aware of the ending of this particular myth then you'll be dreading the ending, but Kindl manages to hit the right note of poignancy without being too depressing or too uplifting.<br /><br />\\"Lost in the Labyrinth\\" was my first read of Patricia Kindl, but it shall not be my last.d and realistic, and the labyrinthine palace with its luxurious baths and dark prisons come to life on the page.

The trademark feature of Lloyd Alexander's storytelling is to choose a cultural background and weave his own story into the already existing mythology; his most famous example of this is of course \\"The Chronicles of Prydain\\", in which his own story and characters were melded with the myths and legends of Wales (as found in \\"The Mabinogian\\"). \\"The Iron Ring\\" gets a similar treatment, as worked into the story are elements of \\"The Mahabharata\\" and \\"The Ramayana\\", India's great national epics.<br /><br />Tamar is the young king of a small kingdom, who is doing a rather successful job at ruling under the guidance of his loyal wise-man Rajaswami and military leader Darshan until one day he foolishly plays and looses a game of chance to the mysterious king Jaya. Waking the next morning, he finds that he has bet his life away and as proof of his bondage is an iron ring upon his finger. But was it a dream or not? Determined to find out, Tamar leaves his kingdom for Jaya's mountain city of Mahapura in the hopes of saving his honour and keeping his dharma intact.<br /><br />On the way however, he becomes severely sidetracked. Meetings with monkey kings and wrestling with giant serpents finally leads to him to swearing his allegiance to King Aswara, a noble lord whose city has been usurped by his murderous cousin Nahusha. Along with his allies (which now include a complaining eagle, a beautiful milk-maid and an odd curiosity-seeker who has lived for the past year in an ant hill), Tamar sets his will against Nahusha. Needless to say, he learns many important lessons on the way, concerning life, death and love, and most importantly on the infamous Indian caste system that ranks all people from the highest brahamas to the \\"Untouchables\\"; the chandalas. Throw in plenty of talking animals, a magical jewel, several daring plans and Alexander's unmistakable brand of humour and you have a fantastic story.<br /><br />Most people will pick up on several components of Indian culture and mythology, namely the caste system and the ideologies behind dharma and karma. I was especially pleased to see that Alexander knows the correct definition of \\"karma\\" - most Westerners believe it is the idea of \\"what comes around, goes around\\", when in fact it is more akin to our idea of \\"fate\\" and the events surrounding a person's destiny.<br /><br />There are a couple of slight problems, one being the sudden and therefore unconvincing love story between Tamar and Mirri the gopi. She's a typical Alexander heroine: beautiful, headstrong and wise, but her bond with Tamar is based on love at first sight, something that only \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" has been able to get away with. Furthermore, anyone who has read \\"The Chronicles of Prydain\\" cannot help but notice the similarities between the characters, especially in the main quartets of Tamar, Mirri, Hashkat and Adi-Kavi with Taran, Elionwy, Gurgi and Fflewddur Fflam - in fact when Hashkat the monkey king first appeared, for a surreal moment I thought it *was* Gurgi!<br /><br />But these are minor quibbles: Alexander is one of the best authors of children's fantasy fiction, and \\"The Iron Ring\\" is no exception. Plenty of morals, plenty of magic, and plenty of Indian mythology, you'll not only enjoy it, but be motivated to look more into Indian culture - something that is largely unknown (restricted to Indian food and misinterpretations) to the Western world.e and mythology, namely the caste system and the ideologies behind dharma and karma.

Like most children's fantasy adventures, this one begins with several displaced children, removed from their usual situation due to unfortunate events, and finding their independence in new surroundings. In this case, Gerald, Jimmy and Kathleen find themselves staying at Kathleen's school over the summer holidays in the care of her French teacher. But adventure is on the way, as soon they find a secret path into a beautiful garden where a young princess lies asleep in the centre of a hedge maze.<br /><br />Of course, it's not real princess, only the housekeeper's niece, but soon her games of make-believe come astonishingly real as the children discover that her ring is really magical and capable of granting any wish they desire! Of course, being children their wishes usually lead them to trouble; and in a book full of living statues, dinosaurs, headless ghosts, burglars, embodied clothing, accelerated growth, invisibility, and reunited lovers, there is plenty for the children to handle and for readers to discover.<br /><br />Edith Nesbit is one of the masters of children's literature, and is therefore virtually unknown. Published nearly one hundred years ago, E. Nesbit was a Bohemian liberal and philanthropist with a wicked sense of humour and a respect for children that shines in her thoughtful, realistic portrayal of them in her novels. Though some of the language is a bit dated (yet for me, phrases like \\"jolly good!\\" and \\"what a brick!\\" are part of the charm), the main appeal found within her books is the humour and wit with which the children behave and react to the magical events. Here it is Gerald's habit of narrating the situation, Jimmy's subversive comments concerning his siblings, Kathleen's worrywart nature and Mabel's insistence that she's brave though she speaks: \\"with the tone of the truly terror-stricken.\\"<br /><br />Almost secondary to this portrayal of children's habits is the magical components of the ring that Mabel finds in the secret treasury of Yaldhurst Towers. Making several wayward wishes, the children gradually discover some of the rudimentary rules surrounding the ring and its powers whilst attempting to rectify the problems that they get themselves into. Nesbit's melding of normal life and magic is the defining feature of her work, and for the first few chapters the reader is kept in suspense of what's real and what's not. As we get into the more magical components of the story, Nesbit moves from terror-filled scares to comedic escapades to beautiful moments of mysticism, written in a dreamy poetic prose. At all times Nesbit writes in a conversationalist tone, with an ongoing commentary on the nature of facts and magic.<br /><br />There are some things that could have used some more work, such as a more detailed background story on the ring and its properties. Nesbit has the children realise some fundamental facts about it; such as the time limit on its wishes, the way it removes fear from the wearer and the behavioural changes it creates in the wearer's loved ones, but never explains how and why the ring has these particular traits or where it originally comes from. The golden rule of any fantasy book is for its magical components to have a basic set of rules - if not the book runs the risk of feeling random. In this case the children help to balance the more surreal magical elements, but a few more details on the ring and its origins would have help make the magical storyline a bit more stable.<br /><br />E.

The same can not be said of its sequel \\"The Princess and Curdie\\", which differs so much in tone and content from the original, that it is sometimes difficult to remember it is in fact a sequel to the dreamy, beautiful \\"The Princess and the Goblin\\". Don't get me wrong, I love George MacDonald's wonderful books, and although there are some nuggets of wisdom scattered throughout the book and Irene's grandmother is as fascinating as ever (as well as being one of the few feminine representations of Christian mysticism in children's literature) this particular MacDonald novel left me a little cold.<br /><br />It begins extremely well: after the cataclysmic events at the conclusion of the previous book, the Princess Irene and her father have departed the ruined manor house for her father's castle in the kingdom's capital Gwyntystorm. Curdie and his parents have remained on the mountainside, continuing their humble existence as miners. But Irene's magical great-great-great grandmother still has plans for the young miner, and after he kills one of her pigeons he remorsefully seek her out in order to atone for his crimes. This is precisely what the goddess-like figure of the grandmother hoped for, and within a few chapters she has Curdie all set to go on a quest of his own.<br /><br />But like any good fairy-godmother figure, she equips him with some magical gifts before he goes: the first is the ability to recognise a person's inner being simply by shaking their hands (given via her magical fire-roses). The second is a bizarre looking creature named Lina that will accompany him on his journey. His destination is Gwyntystorm, to the Princess and the King, and the trouble that awaits him there. On the way he encounters several strange creatures; a ragtag much of indescribable animals (which serve a purpose later in the story) and a flock of sinister white birds (which don't, and whose presence in the story is a bit of a mystery). Finally he reaches Gwyntystorm only to find the place is over-run with corruption and a sinister plot against the King.<br /><br />However, there are several things that bothered me throughout the course of the story. First of all is the plot line of the incapacitated king being secretly manipulated by his ministers; even in MacDonald's day this was a tired old story that's been done to death in everything from ancient myth to Arthurian folklore to Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />Secondly is the myriad of plot devices that he brings into the story only to completely ignore later on. This includes the afore-mentioned white birds, but this is a minor occasion that is easily forgotten. More crucial is the character of Lina and the other creatures who are hinted to be transformed humans atoning for their sins; but their development never goes past this hint into something deeper.<br /><br />Third is the treatment with which MacDonald handles many of his characters. On the course of the journey Curdie meets with hardly any decent or worthy people. With the exception of Derba and her young granddaughter, the entire world seems to be made up of rude, greedy, loathsome individuals who throw rocks, call names, set dogs on travellers and other heinous things. Of course, this may be truer to life than some would like to admit, but the inclusion of so many horrible people, both in the palace and in the streets is wearying after a while. It is especially painful when MacDonald gets to the climax of the story, when all the wrong-doers are inevitably punished for their sins. Perhaps some readers will get a sense of self-righteous pleasure out of the pain MacDonald places upon them, but for me it felt as though an almost sadistic pleasure was taken in terrifying and destroying these people: a man whose nose is bitten all the way through, women and children are scared witless, a man's finger is bitten off, and MacDonald's own words: \\"they were smeared with rancid dripping, their faces were rubbed in maggots.\\" My ideas of Christianity and its meanings are based around redemption, forgiveness and grace; yet I found very little of such things here. All the things I have described are found within the chapter: \\"Vengeance\\" and continues in \\"More Vengeance.\\" Didn't God say: \\"Vengeance is mine?\\" Isn't wrath one of the seven deadly sins?<br /><br />Finally the King himself goes out, but by this stage I had to wonder: is there anyone left in his city to govern? By making the city of Gwyntystorm such a vile place I found no pleasure in the characters' successful defence of it, and the final page of the book that recounts the ultimate fate of the city is utterly unappealing.<br /><br />I hate writing bad reviews, especially when they disagree with other Amazon.com reviewers whose opinions I often agree with and whose advice I take (that's you E. A. Solinas!), but I really didn't like \\"The Princess and Curdie.\\" Don't let this put you off other George MacDonald books, especially \\"The Princess and the Goblin\\" but I recommend you give this one a miss.and MacDonald's own words: \\"they were smeared with rancid dripping, their faces were rubbed in maggots.\\" My ideas of Christianity and its meanings are based around redemption, forgiveness and grace; yet I found very little of such things here.

Will You Pass Through?"	\\"Through the Veil\\" is the ninth book in the \\"Circle of Three\\" series, which chronicles three teenagers' journey through a year-and-a-day of discovering and exploring Wicca. If you haven't yet come across these books, I suggest you stop reading now and head back to book number one \\"So Mote It Be\\", as the books are very closely tied together and it's near impossible to read them out of chronological order (which is annoying, but there you go).<br /><br />The three girls are Kate, Cooper and Annie (the ex-popularity queen, the rebel and the nerd are their individual personalities in a nutshell) and in \\"Through the Veil\\" they are fast approaching Halloween - Samhain in the Wicca calendar. Samhain marks the thinning of the veils between the living and the dead, which is especially relevant for Annie considering her parents passed away when she was young.<br /><br />This title deals mainly with Annie - she is approaching her sixteenth birthday, and has asked her aunt if she can take a visit to San Francisco for her present. She lived there with her parents before they were killed in a house fire that she accidently started. Now she's been having disturbing nightmares about them and seeks out a way to communicate with them. As such, a few Wiccan rituals are thrown in - a meeting with a physic, a circle taken place at Annie's old home, and the coven's Samhain celebration itself which involves some symbollic \\"role-playing\\" along the same lines as the events that took place in \\"What the Cards Said\\" and \\"In the Dreaming\\". Not that that's a bad thing - these gatherings are pretty much the only reason I keep reading these books.<br /><br />Meanwhile Kate and Cooper are dealing with their own (less critical) problems. Kate's parents are vehemently against her involvement in witchcraft and react by sending her to a therapist, confiscating her Wiccan tools and forbidding her from seeing her boyfriend or from attending her Wiccan class. Cooper on the other hand has quit her band due to the fact they aren't interested in playing her Wiccan-themed songs (fair enough, I say - she doesn't half over-react!) and just found out that her parents are separating.<br /><br />As you can see, the plot is all over the place and often comes across as messy with the constant switching points of view - if would have felt more focused if Isobel Bird had chosen one girl and developed her personal story more fully (Annie's is certainly the most important, but Kate and Cooper get just as much screen-time). On top of the three stories outlined above, Bird also crams in a love interest for Annie's aunt, a physic that communicates with Annie's parents, and a truly bizarre transsexual witch - I'm sorry, but I couldn't quite see the point of that particular character.<br /><br />\\"Through the Veil\\" is one of the more interesting installments, despite the lack of a clear storyline and the hopelessly cheesy ending. \\"The Circle of Three\\" books are hardly high literature, but for me they're quick, mildly entertaining reads. The three girls are sympathetic enough to justify getting hold of other books in the series, but be quick - they're already out of print.band due to the fact they aren't interested in playing her Wiccan-themed songs (fair enough, I say - she doesn't half over-react!) and just found out that her parents are separating.  <br /> <br />As you can see, the plot is all over the place and often comes across as messy with the constant switching points of view - if would have felt more focused if Isobel Bird had chosen one girl and developed her personal story more fully (Annie's is certainly the most important, but Kate and Cooper get just as much screen-time).

Soon she's the talk of the school, with a range of popular girls requesting information on everything from careers to boys to future events. Flattered by the attention, Annie eagerly agrees to show off her gift.<br /><br />Well, you don't need Annie's precognitive abilities to know what happens next - some people are freaked out by her premonitions, and when others discover that the future doesn't bring them exactly what they want, they end up blaming Annie for their misfortune. The moral of the story: don't abuse your gifts. But I could've told you that *before* you read this book.<br /><br />That ultimately is the main problem with Isobel Bird's books - they're just so darn predictable. Just reading the blurbs on the back covers will give away the whole story. Furthermore, some details of this story just don't work well, and are devoid of any meaningful suspense or climax. For instance, at one stage Annie tries to \\"test\\" the powers of the cards, and ends up telling Sasha a fib concerning her reading. This results in Sasha running away, and the inevitable \\"lesson-learnt\\" speech from her Wicca teachers. But then what happens? Annie solves the problem by doing *another* Tarot card reading, that not only tells the reader what they already know, but doesn't help find Sasha in any way. A few minutes later the phone rings, informing them that Sasha's been found and is on her way home. So much for dramatic tension.<br /><br />Of course, one might argue that Bird is simply adhering to a realistic course of events, but really, if any practicing Wicca thinks that meeting the goddess Hecate in the flesh, or experiencing Tarot card readings that are *that* accurate comes under the term \\"realistic\\", then they're kidding themselves.<br /><br />But Bird's books are not all bad, as she has a clear, concise (if rather dull) narrative voice, which can clearly describe what the tarot is all about and brings to life a rather enjoyable coven ritual in which the witches-in-training are sent into the woods in order to meet folks dressed as the characters of the tarot.<br /><br />The three girls are likeable and Bird's most worthy attribute is the way she is gradually letting them grow and learn, but they are also rather unimaginative stereotypes: Annie is the brainy one, Cooper is the rebel and Kate is the popular one who is now suffering for her involvement in witchcraft. They are also surrounded by rather tired stereotypes for friends and associates - the streetwise runaway, the sensitive boyfriend, the catty b*tch (sorry, Amazon would censor me if I spelt it out) and all of their Wiccan teachers are virtual clones of each other.<br /><br />Ultimately, these books are what I classify as \\"holiday reads\\" - they are short, cheap, forgetful buys that you can read whilst travelling, but not be too upset about if they're misplaced.nts, but really, if any practicing Wicca thinks that meeting the goddess Hecate in the flesh, or experiencing Tarot card readings that are *that* accurate comes under the term \\"realistic\\", then they're kidding themselves.  <br /> <br />But Bird's books are not all bad, as she has a clear, concise (if rather dull) narrative voice, which can clearly describe what the tarot is all about and brings to life a rather enjoyable coven ritual in which the witches-in-training are sent into the woods in order to meet folks dressed as the characters of the tarot.  <br /> <br />The three girls are likeable and Bird's most worthy attribute is the way she is gradually letting them grow and learn, but they are also rather unimaginative stereotypes: Annie is the brainy one, Cooper is the rebel and Kate is the popular one who is now suffering for her involvement in witchcraft.

George MacDonald found out his talent for telling fairy tales due to the fact that he had eleven children, and after the success of \\"At the Back of the North Wind\\", which was published serially in a magazine, MacDonald wrote his two most famous and popular books: \\"The Princess and the Goblin\\" and its sequel \\"The Princess and Curdie\\". From these books came the inspiration that brought about the two most famous fantasy authors ever known: J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, both of whom are much indebted to MacDonald's innovative fairytales and it can be safely said that both `The Lord of the Rings' and the `Chronicles of Narnia' are direct descendants of MacDonald's work. From these two original fairytales, Tolkien borrowed the idea of the goblin-infested mountain which arose in his own work as the Mines of Moria, whilst Lewis adopted MacDonald's trend of investing magic and enchantment with Christian images and themes.<br /><br />\\"The Princess and the Goblin\\" centres around two young protagonists: the young princess Irene (pronounced with three syllables: I - Reen - Nee) and the slightly older Curdie, a boy who mines in the mountains. They live close to each other without knowing it, as Irene has grown up on a castle by the mountainside, away from her father and his court whilst Curdie lives with his parents in a simple cottage near the mine shafts.<br /><br />On a rainy afternoon, when the princess is bored, she explores the old castle and discovers a magical room at the top of the house where her great-great-great grandmother waits for her, accompanied by her pigeons and her magic rose-fires, spinning her a very special gift. Meanwhile, young Curdie is going about his business, knowing full well the danger that he and his fellow miners face everyday due to the population of goblins that live within the mountains that they mine. However, the goblins tend to keep to themselves with the occasion mischievous trick played, and they are easily kept at bay with a cheerful. But now things are different: strange shadows are milling around the castle and Curdie overhears a sinister plot by the goblins to overthrow the king and destroy the homes of those that live above ground. Only together are the two children able to defeat their foes.<br /><br />Also worth noting is MacDonald's treatment of female characters throughout the book; although the nursemaid Lootie is a stereotypical \\"mother hen\\", both the Princess Irene and her great-grandmother are strong female characters - rare for a book first published in 1872. It is Irene who is charged with the task of rescuing Curdie from the clutches of the goblins rather than the other way around, leading her through the darkness of the subterranean caves, guided by a single golden thread (symbolic of faith). Even more thought-provoking is her great-grandmother, who represents the divine within the story. Other books (such as the afore-mentioned \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\", and many more besides) solely have male figures as their heavenly figures, and is a common theme in later fantasy books for powerful, spiritual females to have a \\"Mother Nature\\" or mystical feel to them. Here however, MacDonald presents the angelic spirit in the form of a woman, and the result is rarer in books than many are aware of.<br /><br />\\"The Princess and the Goblin\\" is a true gem of a book, simple yet meaningful, humorous yet poignant and one of those essential children's books that are just as enjoyable for adults to read as they are for children.

Anne Rice's second vampire novel is both a prequel and a sequel to her original story \\"Interview with the Vampire\\". A sequel because it is framed by a sequence of events in contemporary times, and a prequel because it recounts the history of the vampire Lestat, the sire of the protagonist Louis in \\"Interview\\". After waking from centuries-sleep in 1980's New Orleans, Lestat discovers the \\"Interview\\" manuscript and goes about setting the story straight, recounting his mortal life as a young French aristocrat, his transformation into a vampire, and his ongoing quest to find the answers behind his new condition. Stretching from the French Revolution to Egyptian myth to the modern day world, his journey is one that only an immortal could take, and we're lucky enough to be taken along for the ride.<br /><br />Lestat is perhaps Rice's most popular creation, and it's easy enough to see why: he is charismatic, merciful, deep-thinking and tormented; in other words a truly three-dimensional character and possibly the most relatable member of the undead in the huge vampiric canon of books and movies (well, with the possible exception of Angel and Spike). His moral crisis on becoming a vampire is especially intriguing, with his reluctance to destroy innocent mortals.<br /><br />More than this however, is Rice's (and consequently Lestat's) exploration into the mythos of the vampire and the search for the origins of the vampire. She ingeniously melds the legends of ancient Britain, Greece and Egypt to tell the complete history of the vampire creatures, making especially good use of the myth of Osiris and Isis, whose existence bears a fascinating similarity to the making of a vampire. Finally Lestat gets to the heart of the matter after tracking down different vampires of increasing age, and the full truth behind the vampire and the creation of the first vampires. It is one of the most interesting and thought-provoking theories on the subject that I have ever read, and yields further revelations and connections on each re-reading.<br /><br />As well as this, Rice includes Lestat's complex relationships with his mother and best friend who become privy to his vampiric secret, and toward the end Louis and Claudia are mentioned also (so make sure you've read \\"Interview\\" as Lestat gives away the details of their life together).  Fellow vampires such as Armand, Marius and Magnus make prominent appearances, all of whom had later novels dedicated to their characters and serve as \\"stepping stones\\" to Lestat's journey of discovery, each yielding more clues and information to the intellectual path that he takes.<br /><br />Rice's language is gorgeous to read, rich and poetic and full of sublime passages and descriptions. Sometimes she can go a little overboard: on more than one occasion I found myself reading a passage and realising I had no idea what was going on, but her rich detail and extensive knowledge of history sets her vampires in an utterly realistic and mysterious world. Concepts such as \\"the conversation\\", the Savage Garden and the wolf killer echo through the novel, adding resonance and extra meaning to the unfolding story where the smallest detail can hold the greatest importance.<br /><br />All in all, an immensely rich and rewarding read at times scary, beautiful, intriguing, and exceptionally clever. Rice has created a new breed of vampires that are both similar and extremely different from those of traditional folklore. Usually I dislike books that make vampires \\"good guys\\" and thereby strip them of any potency or menace whatsoever, but Rice is the only author that I know of (with the exception of Angel and Spike of course) who makes this work.

Susan Cooper is best known for her five-part \\"The Dark is Rising\\" series, a sequence of fantasy novels that any self-respecting lover of fantasy should have on their bookshelf. Among her lesser known works is the time-slip adventure \\"King of Shadows\\", a picture book trilogy based on Celtic legends, and two stories chronicling the doings of a Scottish boggart: \\"The Boggart\\" and its sequel \\"The Boggart and the Monster\\".<br /><br />In the Western Highlands of Scotland lives a mysterious and mischievous spirit known as a boggart. Living at the ancient Castle Keep (but often moving about the countryside), the creature of Wild Magic delights in the confusion and amusement that its daily tricks create. But when the elderly Duncan MacDevon dies in his sleep, the inheritance of the castle falls to his great-nephew Robert Volnik and his family living in Toronto, Canada.<br /><br />The Volnik children are twelve-year old Emily and nine-year old computer-genius Jessup, who are surprised and delighted at the prospect at a holiday in Scotland. Their visit involves meeting Tommy Cameron (who secretly knows all about the boggart), seal-watching, sight-seeing and rationalising the strange occurrences at the Keep. As the holiday draws to a close each sibling is promised one bit of furniture each before the castle is sold: and Emily chooses a beautiful old writing desk. Unbeknownst to all, it is here that the boggart has curled itself up to slumber, and ends up travelling with them to Toronto.<br /><br />The collision of the modern world and Wild Magic brings exactly what you'd expect: havoc. Exploring the technological wonders of this new world whilst keeping to its mandate of mischief making, the boggart eventually causes some rather dangerous mischief. The Volnik family don't know what to make of the surge in bad luck and strange phenomena, but eventually the children stumble to the idea of a boggart thanks to the wisdom of their father's theatre crew. Now their only concern is how to return the homesick boggart back to his rightful home: magic has long since seeped from the world, so perhaps a technological solution can be found...<br /><br />\\"The Boggart\\" is a beautifully written, thoughtful and interesting book, taking a unique premise and exploring it in both a contemporary and more old-fashioned setting. Cooper is wonderful at describing countryside, circumstances and human reactions to both the mundane and the supernatural. Poignancy is also her speciality; witness a scene in which a grieving boggart affects the sleep of the entire community, who experience the shared dream of an ancient funeral. It's both eerie and poetic.<br /><br />However, Cooper is on less firmer ground when she reaches Toronto. Although the boggart reacts to the change in scenery amusingly, and the chaos that it creates carries a somewhat darker edge to it, she also introduces several characters and situations that are not dealt with in a particular satisfactory manner: such as Jessup's groups of friends who (with the exception of Barry) have no real place in the story, and the character of Doctor Stigmore. He witnesses some of the boggart's behaviour and believes that it is Emily's doing through psychokinesis; he begins to harass the family and notifies a television show, but both of these plot threads are left hanging, with no resolution at all as to what happens.<br /><br />One thing I did appreciate was how this story fits in nicely with \\"The Dark is Rising\\" sequence, where Cooper goes into more detail on the nature of Wild Magic. Although there is no mention of Old Ones or any other components of that series, \\"The Boggart\\" does fit into the `literary world' that she created there. The kids are interesting and realistic, the parents sympathetic and delightfully eccentric, and the Boggart is a character that shines throughout the book; a true creature of wild and untamed magic.<br /><br />Long before J. K. Rowling gave us the spooky Boggarts that inhabit dark places and take the form of your darkest fears, Susan Cooper brought us this spritely, loveable, intriguing figure of Scottish legend. Look out for its sequel \\"The Boggart and the Monster\\".that inhabit dark places and take the form of your darkest fears, Susan Cooper brought us this spritely, loveable, intriguing figure of Scottish legend.

Where did Tinkerbell come from? How did Hook loose his hand? And most importantly - how did Captain Hook and Peter Pan meet? This last question is the one which Paige Pearson asked her father after hearing \\"Peter Pan\\" which in turn led to Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson's collaborative effort at \\"Peter and the Starcatchers\\", the prequel to J. M. Barrie's classic work of children's literature.<br /><br />The result is decidedly mixed: although some components are marvellously clever and mysterious, others fail to engage the reader's imagination, and at some points they make the blasphemous mistake of tampering with the established facts of Barrie's invented world. Barrie's Neverland is the internal world of child's imagination, a place of escape and fantasy. Barry/Pearson change this concept, and Neverland goes from a place accessible only by following \\"the second star to the right and straight on till morning\\", to a standard desert island affected with external magic.<br /><br />But I'm getting ahead of myself. The story begins in London, where two ships are setting sail: \\"the Wasp\\" and \\"the Never Land\\" (how the ship got this rather odd name is sadly never explained). On board the Never Land are six young orphan boys, a young lady and her governess, and a mysterious trunk that has a strange effect on those carrying it aboard. Among the orphans is young Peter, who soon makes a tentative friendship with the young Molly, a girl who seems to have an agenda of her own upon the ship.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the pirate ship \\"Sea Devil\\", led by its villainous Captain Black Stache is laying in wait for \\"The Wasp\\", and the great treasure that it is said to be carrying in its hold, a treasure beyond gold and jewels. This trunk and its mysterious contents are the focus of the story, and amidst sea battles, castaways and escapes, the parties involved come to Mollusk Island, where things take another turn for the worst, and the beginnings of the \\"Peter Pan\\" story begin to come together.<br /><br />The book begins promisingly: the characters are vivid, the narrative strong, and the premise intriguing. Molly in particular is a great character, innocent yet sophisticated, with a strong sense of morale duty and a surplus of bravery, intelligence and resourcefulness. She's by far the most striking character in the book, eclipsing even Peter himself. The authors' idea of Starcatchers and `starstuff' was an interesting one, and deserved more attention than it got - in fact, I think it would have been more successful overall if they'd discarded the \\"Peter Pan\\" prequel angle, and concentrated solely on the Starcatchers' mission.<br /><br />As I mentioned, it all goes reasonably well until Barry and Pearson begin to tamper with the original text of J. M. Barrie, changing several facts established in his novel of how things in Neverland work. It isn't just little details however, which could be forgiven or overlooked, but fundamental components to Barrie's novel, such as Peter's ability to fly, his eternal youth, how he gets to Neverland in the first place, the nature of Neverland, the arrival of the Lost Boys, the existence of Tinkerbell - all are changed in order to fit around Barry/Pearson's central conceit: the magical substance of \\"starstuff\\", the residue from falling stars. These changes are inexcusable, as they meddle with the very meaning and purpose of Barrie's \\"Peter Pan\\" and making me seriously wonder if Barry and Pearson have actually read the book, or just an abridged \\"children's version\\".<br /><br />Likewise, I could never really connect their version of Peter with Barrie's original Peter Pan: he is neither cocky nor self-interested enough, and his romantic interest in Molly is a development that really shouldn't have taken place. Black Stache makes a better future Captain Hook (though they strangely don't make this connection explicit), especially in his treatment of his crew and first-mate Smee, and hisstoryline with the crocodile is excellent (the line \\"as if [the crocodile] knew he had all the time in the world\\" is especially sublime). But where is Hook's tortured soul, his upper-class breeding, his charisma and intrigue? Here he's presented as a vicious pirate and his hatred of Peter rings false - and the fact that one of Peter's friends is called \\"James\\" is a frustrating red herring.<br /><br />At some points the humour and whimsy are great, such as the involvement of the porpoises and Molly's minimal grasp of their language; at other times it just comes across as strange: a sail made out of a huge brassiere? Huh? Yet Greg Call's black and white illustrations are beautiful, very reminiscent of Barrie's \\"Peter Pan\\" and manage to be both whimsical and realistic at the same time.<br /><br />Ultimately, I think that this should be read only if you're a very tolerant reader. Fans of Barrie's \\"Peter Pan\\" will be absolutely livid at the liberties taken with his classic story, and needless to say, this is not a novel that is endorsed or recognised by Barrie's family or the Children's Hospital that owns the publishing rights to the book. For the first \\"official\\" sequel to Barrie's book, you'll have to wait until Geraldine McCaughrean's \\"Captain Pan\\", due for publication in the near future. Until then, \\"Peter Pan\\" by J. M. Barrie is the definitive source for all things Neverland, though I also highly recommend the 2003 movie release of \\"Peter Pan\\" starring Jeremy Sumpter and Jason Issacs, all of which are more faithful to Barrie than \\"Peter and the Starcatchers.\\"Smee, and his storyline with the crocodile is excellent (the line \\"as if [the crocodile] knew he had all the time in the world\\" is especially sublime).

There has been a series of short story anthologies aimed at children from \\"A Pocketful of Stories for Five Year Olds\\", to this, the last of the age groups and the biggest vessel - a chest. Pat Thomson has brought together a range of short stories aimed at nine year olds, ranging from humorous ones, scary ones, poignant ones old folktales and science-fiction stories. Some are definitely better than others, as a couple are rather inappropriate for any age group, let alone nine year olds, but on the whole this is an entertaining collection of stories that I myself received on my ninth birthday.<br /><br />\\"Little Red Riding Hood: The Wolf's Story\\" is a gem, one in David Henry Wilson's series of fractured fairy-tales that takes new angles on old stories, and in this case paints the big bad wolf as the innocent victim, and Red Riding Hood and her grandmother (who has an unlicensed gun) as the conniving villains. My primary school teacher used to read us Wilson's short stories, and it would always end with us laughing hysterically.<br /><br />Philippa Pearce (best known for \\"Tom's Midnight Garden\\") gives us the creepy tale of \\"The Shadow Cage\\". Ned Challis finds a strange green bottle on Whistler's Hill and gives it to his daughter, who then trades it to her younger cousin Kevin. The bottle has a strange effect on Kevin, and when he leaves it behind in the playground, he decides to go out at night in order to fetch it. The atmosphere is captured perfectly with the unspoken unease that the adults share about Whistler's Hill and the mysterious story of the so-called witch that lived there.<br /><br />\\"Poor Arthur\\" is Gene Kemp's short, somewhat bitter, but very poignant ode to all the pets out there that always come second fiddle to the \\"favourite\\" animal of the household. Arthur and Chuchi are two gerbils, but both come to very different ends - Kempe has no sentimentality; this story tells it as it is.<br /><br />\\"The Cat Who Lived in a Drainpipe\\" is perhaps the longest story in the anthology, and written by the wonderful Joan Aiken, who's given the world of children's literature a wonderful selection of novels. Here she takes the real life figure of Tomaso Albinoni and works in his musical career with the night-time concerts of three cats: chimney-sweep Nero, palace-cat Sandro and the timid, tiny Seppi who falls in love with the human's beautiful music and ends up saving the young musician's life.<br /><br />\\"The Asrai\\" is Pat Thomson's own contribution to the collection, a short but mysterious and memorable account of a man's experience with an Asrai; an aquatic creature found in real folklore.<br /><br />The next two stories are both retellings of old fairytales, one from the Grimm's fairytales, the other from the Arabian Nights. Mark Cohen gives us \\"The Cat and the Dog\\", who get the best of wild animals and their cruel owner, and Naomi Lewis retells \\"The Prince and the Tortoise\\", which tells of the youngest son of the monarch marrying a tortoise, who has magical gifts and ultimately gets the better of her scheming sisters-in-law.<br /><br />\\"Nothing to Be Afraid Of\\" is definitely my favourite: silent and wimpish Robin is put in the care of Anthea and her mother who are quite at a loss at how to handle this little boy hiding under the table. Finally Anthea decides to take him to the park, and in a bid to get some life into him begins to make up stories. The vines around a tree become a serpent, a private walkway becomes haunted by two leopards and a manhole cover becomes the home of the Greasy Witch. But all of this influence on the boy has a rather unexpected result...<br /><br />\\"Lucott the Pirate\\" by Dinah Starkey is the rather too simple story of a ghost pirate, who terrorises the community of Porlock before being exorcised by a priest.

Brian Patten has brought together a range of famous and beloved children's poems from throughout the twentieth century, moving backwards chronologically from Richard Edwards to Thomas Hardy, and all those that came between. Some of the more famous names include Walter de Mare, Roald Dahl, Roger McGough, Robert Frost, Rudyard Kipling, T.S. Eliot, W. B. Yeats and A. A. Milne (who refreshingly does not have a Winnie the Pooh poem published here). Even Patten himself contributes several of his own poems.<br /><br />Although the range of poems goes from nonsense and humorous poems to serious and poignant poems, there are a few over-reaching themes: many have a Biblical themes, such as G. K. Chesterton's \\"The Donkey\\" and Sydney Carter's \\"Lord of the Dance,\\" and a few others enjoy the subject of children that are unexceptional in school, but are abundant in imaginative life. There is also more than one that centres on the phenomena of snow, and of course plenty that highlight the pains of teachers, homework, siblings and other relatives.<br /><br />On the whole, Patten has a wonderful mix of different poets and genres, presenting a book full of every possible kind of poem you could imagine, both familiar and brand new. Beloved poems such as Frost's \\"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\\" and Dahl's \\"Down with Children!\\" from \\"the Witches\\" are present, as is Yeat's haunting words: \\"Come away, O human children.../ For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand...\\" and Banjo Paterson's \\"Who'll come a-Waltzing Matilda with Me?\\"<br /><br />Among the funny poems are Morris Bishop's priceless \\"How to Treat Elves\\", whose final line never fails to make me laugh and A. E. Housman's abrupt \\"The Grizzly Bear\\": \\"The Grizzly Bear is huge and wild/ He has devoured the infant child/ The infant child is not aware / He has been eaten by the Bear...\\" There are the more serious ones, such as Vernon Scannell's \\"The Apple Raid\\" and Adrian Henri's \\"Tonight at Noon\\", both of which begin as fun, light-hearted poetry, but end in utter poignancy.<br /><br />My other two favourites that I just have to mention are Edward Lowbury's \\"The Huntsman\\" and Walter de Mare's famous \\"The Listeners\\" - but there's so much material here that it's impossible to do it all justice. The fact that Patten orders the poems in the reverse order of when they were published is fascinating, as it's like taking a poetic journey back in time, and I felt that ending with Thomas Hardy's \\"Transformations\\" was an amazing choice, as it remarkably echoes Phillip Pullman's major idea in his \\"His Dark Material\\" trilogy. \\"Northern Lights\\" of course was not published till four years after this anthology, but for such an old poem to connect with such a contemporary idea is rather uncanny.<br /><br />Brian Patten supplies us with an introduction, as well as several indexes and biographical notes on all the poets, and Michael Foreman simple but imaginative illustrations dot every other page. They are somewhat unnecessary, since the poems create their own pictures in one's mind, but do not detract from the book in any way. For a celebration of Puffin Book's fiftieth year, this anthology is thoughtful, funny, intriguing, sad and celebrates the work of many poets and their gifts to children.which begin as fun, light-hearted poetry, but end in utter poignancy.  <br /> <br />My other two favourites that I just have to mention are Edward Lowbury's \\"The Huntsman\\" and Walter de Mare's famous \\"The Listeners\\" - but there's so much material here that it's impossible to do it all justice.

With a blurb that proclaims that this is a story that will make you believe in God, one thing can be said that \\"Life of Pi\\" certainly has big ambitions. The amazing thing about it however, is that (for me, anyway) it makes a pretty good case for this statement to be true.<br /><br />Yann Martel begins the tale describing his own experiences as a writer with the dreaded writer's block. Taking a trip to India in order to bring his inspiration to life, he meets Mr Adirubasamy, a man who claims to know a story that will make you believe in God. Intrigued, Martel inquires further, gathers the relevant information and is soon knocking on Piscine Molitor Patel's door. Piscine Patel (strictly \\"Pi\\" for short) survived for over a year in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger, relying his logic and reason, his animalistic instincts and above all, his abiding faith in God to help him do it.<br /><br />Martel switches to Pi's story, telling it to us in first-person narrative, as Pi tells us of his life in India before his fateful voyage to Canada. He was the son of a zoo-owner, and happily spent his childhood studying the animals in the paradise-like Pondicherry Zoo, and following his own rather unorthodox religion of Hinduism, Christianity and Islam, delighting and believing in all three.<br /><br />But when the ship taking him and his family to Canada sinks, Pi finds himself adrift in a lifeboat with a zebra, an orang-utan, a hyena and a 450-pound Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Fighting to stay alive in such conditions is Pi's task for the next two hundred and twenty seven days, as gradually he realises that the only way to survive Richard Parker is to learn to live with him. The domestication of the tiger begins as Pi becomes the ringleader, zookeeper and alpha male in the tiny world of the lifeboat.<br /><br />On the way, Pi must deal with his own physical suffering and internal impulses, as well as a cannibalistic Frenchman, the tediousness of the days and an island that Jonathan Swift's Gulliver seems to have missed on his own voyage - an island holding a carnivorous secret.<br /><br />It all sounds more than a little odd, but Martel grasps our suspension of disbelief and forces us to make us believe in what he's saying. It is not simply his attention to detail of the lifeboat's interior, the systematic taming of Richard Parker (rest assured, if you ever find yourself in a lifeboat with a tiger after reading this, you'll know exactly what to do), or the outside sources he quotes, such as the newspaper articles on Pi's ordeal or the transcript of the Japanese businessmen's discussion with Pi, but the utter conviction with which he speaks.  I could not help but agree with whatever he said, whether it was the state of animals in zoos or the workings of God and mankind. The degree of wit and intelligence he writes with is intoxicating.<br /><br />The third and final part of the book is perhaps the most fascinating, when Pi discusses his voyage with the two Japanese businessmen, and ends up telling them two stories: one that he claims is true, with the animals in tact, and a second one in which he replaces them with humans in a more realistic, though painfully dreadful version of events. He then poses the question: since it doesn't really make a difference which one you believe, then you have a choice on which one you decide see as the \\"true\\" one.  In this lies the promising statement - that this story will make you believe in God, as Martel points out the advantages of faith far outweigh those found in atheism. And since there's a good chance it doesn't make a difference anyway, Martel's answer to \\"Why believe in God?\\" is:<br /><br />Why not?that Jonathan Swift's Gulliver seems to have missed on his own voyage - an island holding a carnivorous secret.  <br /> <br />It all sounds more than a little odd, but Martel grasps our suspension of disbelief and forces us to make us believe in what he's saying.

Out of all Jane Austen's heroines, Emma Woodhouse is perhaps the most unique and the most beloved. Unlike all the others, Emma is a wealthy young woman who does not have the pressure of making a good marriage to ensure her happiness and in fact is determined never to wed. Likewise, due to the affections of her father and governess, Emma has been indulged and encouraged all her life into behaving just as she pleases, and as one of the few members of nobility in the small county of Highbury she is a big fish in a very small pond. Due to this, she considers herself superior to others and confident of her own perception of things: to put it simply, she is a snob. Yet she is not dislikeable - she is loving, well-mannered and kind, and deep down she realises that many of her actions are folly - it just takes her a while to get to these conclusions.<br /><br />Crediting herself for the recent marriage of her governess to the estimable Mr Weston, Emma takes it upon herself to play matchmaker for Highbury's society. Her eye is fixed on the eligible clergyman Mr Elton as an excellent match for her new friend Harriet Smith, a girl of obscure birth and minimal wealth. Despite the cynicism of Mr Knightley, an old family friend and the caution of her dear Mrs Weston, Emma is too wrapped up in her own opinions of how human hearts work to heed their advice...<br /><br />Further irony is found in the fact that whilst Emma is busy organising the hearts and minds of those around her, she has utterly no regard for her own and finds on many occasions that her perceptions of people were completely mistaken. But this is where readers' affection for her lies: she is beloved *for* her faults, not in spite of them, and such imperfections make her a rich, understandable character. Furthermore, these faults give her room to grow and improve as a person, and she is not the same Emma at the end of the book as she was at the beginning.<br /><br />\\"Emma\\" is also filled with many memorable supporting characters, very few of which are painted in black and white terms - rather they are small portraits of true human life, each with their own good and bad attributes. There is the talkative Miss Bates and her niece Miss Jane Fairfax (who Emma is cool toward due to the fact she detracts attention away from herself), the pretentious Eltons, Emma's sister and brother-in-law, and the and the dashing Frank Churchill, (Mr Weston's son) on whom rest many hopes by his family of an alliance with Miss Woodhouse.<br /><br />Austen writes in beautifully delicate language, which is filled with many of her best moments of wit and insight into the human condition, especially in her themes of social hierarchy and acceptable forms of manners. It is a common belief that authors of the past are hardly ever critical of their own times or station - Austen gloriously proves these narrow-minded people wrong as she weaves together her characters and their various ways of life with commentary on them all. Like all such reads, it's not for a lazy reader as it needs your constant attention and care. But like all truly good literature, it is well worth the effort and considered the best novel in the Jane Austen canon.e supporting characters, very few of which are painted in black and white terms - rather they are small portraits of true human life, each with their own good and bad attributes.

I strongly suggest reading this preceding novel before tacking the sequel as several of the characters and plot twists found here will not be fully appreciated without knowing the previous story (which is a mistake I made).<br /><br />Diana Wynne Jones takes the setting and atmosphere of \\"Arabian Nights\\" and creates her own story filled with flying carpets, deserts, exotic princesses, genies and djinns (although what the difference between these last two species are, she unfortunately never clarifies - I think that genies are contained within an object of some kind, whilst djinns are more god-like). Abdullah is a humble young carpet merchant, with meddling relatives and a strange prophesy recorded at his birth. But Abdullah has no such interest in these things; his favourite past time is day-dreaming about his pretend royal lineage, beautiful princesses and luxurious surroundings.<br /><br />But once a stranger sells Abdullah a so-called magical carpet, things begin to change. After sleeping on the carpet, he awakes in a night garden in the company of the lovely Flower-in-the-Night. Needless to say, the two fall in love and whilst trying to figure out the logistics of the carpet, they plan an elopement. But on the intended night, Abdullah is horrified to witness Flower's kidnapping at the hands of a hideous djinn. Being pursued by the Sultan and all his guards, and still finding that his daydreams are coming true, Abdullah soon finds himself in strange company: traversing the northern land of Ingary (the setting of \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\") with a dishonest soldier, a tricky genie and a rather strange cat and her kitten.<br /><br />He soon finds out that Flower-in-the-Night is being held in a castle in the air (once the former moving castle of the wizard Howl) by a wicked djinn named Dalzel who is sending his captive brother Hasruel out to collect all the princesses in the world for potential wives. The princesses of course, are not going to put up with this - but it's up to Abdullah and the previous cast of  \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" to put everything right.<br /><br />Some other reviewers have complained that the characters of the previous books do not appear until after halfway through - odd, since Sophia, Howl and Calcifer are present almost right from the beginning: not in the forms that you might expect, but they're there and their personalities are just as strong. Suliman and Lettie are there as well and play a small, but vital role in the playing out of the story. Abdullah is a pleasant enough character, but Flower-in-the-Night is a gem: someone intensely naive and sheltered, but intelligent and educational. The brother djinns are also fascinating in terms of their relationship and predicament - I just wish there was more of them, and the soldier is an intriguing enigma.<br /><br />Touches of Diana Wynne Jones's wonderful humour are sprinkled throughout, from the soldier's near-worship of the two cats, to Flower-in-the-Night's insistence that Abdullah is a female. The climax is a little rushed, and I'm not exactly sure how the genie discovered that where Hasruel's life was, but over all \\"Castle in the Air\\" is a great sequel, and a great book.

Even though two stars may seem like a bad rating, keep in mind that it technically means \\"fair\\". If stars were a grade in an essay, it would be C+ - a pass, but not a particularly brilliant one. Such is the case of \\"A Knight of the Word\\", the sequel to Terry Brooks's \\"Running with the Demon,\\" a much more rewarding book.<br /><br />The basic premise is a good against evil plot, embodied in the forces known as the Word and the Void. Both sides have creatures loyal to them, namely demons on behalf of the Void, and Knights for the Word. The present Knight of the Word is a man named John Ross, who lives a lonely existence; wandering an post-apocalyptic future in his dreams in order to find clues and answers to what transpired to prevent it from happening in the present (kinda like \\"Early Edition\\" and \\"Tru Calling\\" - remember those shows?)<br /><br />Anyway, after a botched rescue mission that results in the deaths of several children, Ross gives up his calling and settles down to a new life. He has a girlfriend Stefanie Winslow, and they both work for \\"the Wizard of Oz\\", the nickname given to Simon Lawrence, a charity worker for homeless people. Meanwhile, the magically inclined Nest Freemark (the young girl that Ross saved in \\"Running with the Demon\\") is now nineteen years old and in a rut in her life.<br /><br />All seems reasonably well, but the Word's messenger, a tatterdemalion named Arial assures Nest that Ross has made himself vulnerable to the Void by ignoring his calling, and only Nest can make him aware of a demon in his presence attempting to corrupt him. Meanwhile, Back in Seattle, an investigative reporter named Andrew Wren is uncovering suspicious facts that may prove the downfall of Lawrence's foundation and Ross's work.<br /><br />It is a solid enough sequel, but not up to par with its predecessor. I enjoyed \\"Running with the Demon\\" immensely due to its environment (the far-reaching parklands) and the supporting cast. Here however, most of the old cast has died or moved on: Cass Minter and Old Bob have died, Brianna and Jared have moved away, and even the cats are gone. Brooks may be attempting to make the situation true to life, but it comes across as rather depressing. Despite the presence of Robert, Nest feels very much alone in this book, with none of the hope and promise that \\"Running\\" concluded with.<br /><br />Likewise, the streets of Seattle just aren't an interesting setting as Hopewell and the park, and the change in scenery deprives us of Pick's presence. Two Bears appears in little more than a cameo, and Wraith has a relatively minor role that doesn't really have much bearing on the overall story.<br /><br />I found that Nest was the more interesting character out of the two protagonists, though I can't exactly pin point why, and I liked the way the roles had been reversed from the previous book - now Nest is the rescuer. Likewise Arial was an interesting idea (a spirit made up of lost children's memories) and it was fun to see another sylvan - Boot. But I have to admit that unlike other reviewers, the secret identity of the demon did catch me off guard (gimme a break, I was only fourteen when I read it!)<br /><br />Throughout the story Brooks gives us so many lectures on the plight of homeless people that I seriously hope he takes his own advice and gives generously to the poor. Hey, maybe you should take the money you were going to spend on this book and give it to a homeless fund instead! There's an idea I'm sure Brooks would approve of!<br /><br />So my main grievance is that it was too far removed from the direction \\"Running with the Demon\\" seemed to be going in at its end - this instalment is too dark and melancholy.

To make things worse, her parents are going on holiday without her, and have sent her to stay with her Uncle Maurice, Aunt Dierdre and three cousins.<br /><br />Life on the farm isn't too bad considering Tess now has a huge environment to explore, but she misses her fellow-Switcher Kevin who she needs to help her make a final decision. Furthermore, there are strange things happening at the farmhouse: odd-looking animals, shadowy figures in the woods and suspicious activity from her bad-tempered uncle and three secretive cousins. There is a mystery concerning the disappearance of Uncle Declan, and no one in the family is eager to talk about it.<br /><br />And there is even more at risk - Uncle Maurice seems set to sell of the beautiful forest land to developers, and threatens to call up exterminators to rid the house of all the rats. Since Tess is on familiar terms with these rats, and since Kevin has finally gotten hold of her, she comes up with an ingenious way to save the rats, but a plan that has terrible consequences.<br /><br />In the previous books \\"Switchers\\" and \\"Midnight's Choice\\" I was always rather confused at the emphasis that Thompson places on the rats, but now with a wonderful reworking of \\"The Pied Piper of Hamilton\\", it all makes sense. Thompson uses a wonderful blend of old folklore and fairy myth in order to create an interesting story that is superior to \\"Midnight's Choice,\\" though not quite up to par with \\"Switchers\\". Although the final conflict and choice between opposing factions of the story are brought to quite an easy solution (even an abrupt one), readers who have followed Tess's story will get their questions answered.<br /><br />For the first time I felt that I could relate better to Tess: she was rather distant in the previous books, but now finally she and Kevin come across as understandable, three-dimensional characters. Likewise, Uncle Maurice and the cousins Brian, Orla and Colm are interesting enough, but if you were a fan of Lizzie you'll be disappointed: she appears in the first couple of pages, imparts some more cryptic advice and then is gone. But she does better than Martin, who doesn't appear at all, and though Thompson does give us an update on his condition I was hoping for more character development on his behalf.<br /><br />There are some components of the book that just don't work, namely the \\"Star Wars\\" references to the droids C3-PO and R2D2. Within the book there are Switching characters that turn into these droids, and visualising this borders on the ridiculous.

But she does better than Martin, who doesn't appear at all, and though Thompson does give us an update on his condition I was hoping for more character development on his behalf.  <br /> <br />There are some components of the book that just don't work, namely the \\"Star Wars\\" references to the droids C3-PO and R2D2.

Katie is frustrated with her mother's refusal to go on holiday with the family's closest friends. After she was hit by a car, Sarah has been experiencing terrible nightmares that result in her screaming herself awake, and she's too embarrassed to go away just in case it happens in front of her friends.<br /><br />But Katie loves her holidays, and so instead talks her mother into returning to her seaside hometown, in the hopes that the nightmare had something to do with an experience in her youth. Sarah has not seen her father since she was a little girl, and Katie suspects that perhaps physical abuse was involved in her mother and grandmother's reluctance to talk about the man they left when Sarah was very young.<br /><br />But there seems to be more going on in the small town - whilst trying to track down her grandfather, Katie hears rumour of a ghost in the ocean, and meets a strange young girl called Christine who seems to know more than she's saying. The story accumulates in the reunion between father/daughter/granddaughter and the truth of the nightmare revealing itself once more.<br /><br />\\"Storm Voice\\" is an interesting story about a family secret, the poison of guilt, and the various ways in which an adult can harm a child. Despite the above synopsis, \\"Storm Voice\\" is not a ghost story, unless you count the ghostly presence of real and half-forgotten memories that haunt the main characters.<br /><br />Though there is nothing particularly memorable about it, it is a quick read and written with feeling and sensitivity, and has given me something to think about when I watch child actors in the movies. Two and a half stars.	2005-04-10

Due to financial trouble Andrew's parents have been forced to go abroad to search for employment, leaving their three children in the care of an elderly cousin. But although aged Beatrice welcomes elder sister Joanna and younger sister Bella, she instantly dislikes Andrew for no discernible reason. Deciding to keep away from her, Andrew instead devotes his time to creating a model of the farmyard and making friends with Simeon, a young blind Romany-born boy.<br /><br />But something is wrong with Joanna, usually so cheerful and energetic, is now unkind and aloof. Andrew fears there is something drastically wrong with her, and when he follows her one day into the woods he witnesses her puzzling through a strange maze of turf and chalky-white earth. Simeon's grandfather and Romany mother explain the myth of Tailltu, an old Celtic goddess who would receive young sacrifices in order to exchange their goodness for a healthy harvest.<br /><br />What with Beatrice's disagreeable behaviour and several nasty \\"accidents\\" happening around the farm, Andrew has to fulfil his promise to his father to protect the family and rescue his sister from the thrall of the goddess before she reaches the centre of the maze...<br /><br />\\"The Maze\\" is a quick, simple read with no real twists or surprises, but with realistic characters, some genuine laughs and a swiftly flowing plot. The mystery behind the maze and the mystery behind Beatrice's antagonism toward males do not really mesh together (I had anticipated Tailltu's involvement in her life somehow) but the two are interesting enough by themselves.<br /><br />Elizabeth Hawkins's strongest attribute is her portrayal of the loving family torn apart, and its attempts to reach each other again, even in the smallest ways. This refers not just to Andrew's family, but Simeon's too, whose mother had travelling in her blood, but could not take her blind son with her. The friendship between these two boys is also nicely created.<br /><br />Overall a good read, nothing particularly memorable, but still worth the small amount of time you'll take to read it./> <br />Overall a good read, nothing particularly memorable, but still worth the small amount of time you'll take to read it.	2005-04-06

Patricia McKillip is one of the most unique fantasy writers out there, blending echoes of ancient stories in with intricate and elegant poetic-prose that may surprise those new to her writing style. I must admit that her work is an acquired taste, it took me a few tries to fully understand and appreciate her work; to grasp the story underneath the many-layered poetic language that she invokes.<br /><br />\\"The Tower at Stony Wood\\" is no exception to this style, so if you are a first-time reader to McKillip, and find this book incomprehensible; don't give up - try another of her books and you'll most likely become attuned to her way of writing and become as big a fan as I am. In this case, McKillip borrows two ideas from Celtic folklore: the legend of the selkies, half-seal, half-fish women that sometimes abandon the seas to live on the earth, and the famous image of \\"The Lady of Shallot\\" (best known through the works of poet Alfred Tennyson) - the lonely woman who weaves the images she sees in her mirror, imprisoned in a stone tower.<br /><br />In Arthurian legend, this woman is Lady Elaine, who died of her unrequited to Sir Lancelot, but here McKillip gives her a new identity. Cyan Dag is a loyal knight of the King of Gloinmere, who also rules over the isle of Skye and the Northern Isles of Ysse. King Regis Aurum has just taken a bride from Skye, but a bard that has travelled with the bridal party shares with Cyan a terrible revelation: that the new queen is an imposter, and the real Lady Gwynne is imprisoned in a tower, forbidden from seeing the world in its reality.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Thayne Ysse, the heir to the throne of the Northern Islands broods over his country's defeat at the hands of Regis's men, which resulted in his father's madness, his younger brother's crippling, and the terrible penalties of tribute and taxes that followed. He is determined to right the wrongs placed against him, and so goes out in search of a dragon guarded tower which is said to contain a treasure that will certainly provide for an army marching on Gloinmere.<br /><br />And finally, on the island of Skye, in the Stony Wood, in a sea-tower sits Melanthos, who spends her days weaving and watching the images in a small mirror, that reveals another woman, watching another mirror... Melanthos and her mother Sel are entranced by this vision, steadily rejecting the real world in favour of this strange sight.<br /><br />Before the story is over, each of these tales will find each other, woven together by the arts of three mysterious sisters and connected by three very different towers.<br /><br />Ultimately, I don't think \\"The Tower at Stony Wood\\" is McKillip's best work - she instigates two plot twists during the course of the story, and whilst the first one is rather intriguing, it isn't followed up properly, making the second twist rather irksome. Perhaps it warrants a second read, but it just didn't seem entirely convincing to me.<br /><br />As a side-note, if you own Loreena McKinnitt's album \\"The Visit\\", then you might be interested in reading this book whilst listening to the track \\"The Lady of Shallot\\" - it's what inspired McKillip to write this novel, and its lyrics are based on Tennyson's original poetry.s said to contain a treasure that will certainly provide for an army marching on Gloinmere.  <br /> <br />And finally, on the island of Skye, in the Stony Wood, in a sea-tower sits Melanthos, who spends her days weaving and watching the images in a small mirror, that reveals another woman, watching another mirror...

Being an avid fantasy reader I grabbed this book from the children's section at the library to have a browse, impressed by the blurb that listed several awards that author Jackie French has picked up. Within this book are six stories, and contrary to the title, most of them do not have unicorns as the protagonists, but as backup characters to the human heroes. The strength of the stories and the simple, descriptive writing style is found throughout all six stories: \\"Warts\\" and \\"A Present for Aunt Addie\\" are short stories, the next three - \\"Amfylobbsis\\", \\"Spots\\" and \\"The Taming of the Beast\\" are more prose/poetry exercises and the sixth \\"The Lady of the Unicorn\\" is a novella.<br /><br />\\"Warts\\" is a sweet, simple story of healing and though it has a rather ambiguous ending (I think Sam has a dream of his future self) it is clever is the way that it never specifically states that the strange foal Sam's grandma rescues is in fact a unicorn.<br /><br />\\"A Present for Aunt Addie\\" is likely to become most readers favourite even though the unicorn is barely featured - Harry is directed by his father to a strange valley to deliver an unseen 'gift' to his great-great-great aunt who lives by herself in the wilderness. Confused as to how such an old lady could survive out in the harsh land Harry does as he's told and finds himself in an incredible garden...<br /><br />\\"Amfylobbsis\\" (I have no idea how to pronounce that) is a very short story on a blind woman in hospital who gets a visit from her grand-daughter who claims a unicorn named Amfylobbsis has accompanied her. Though the grandmother initially thinks this is impossible, a few startling things happen that make her think otherwise.<br /><br />\\"Spots\\" is a fascinating story that may be lost on younger readers: although it doesn't elaborate very deeply, it implies that surviving victims of the plague were cured by people (From another dimension? From another time?) who have created a 'unicorn' by the magic of DNA switching and deliver antibiotics in the form of sweeties. It ends far too soon and leaves far too many unanswered questions.<br /><br />\\"The Taming of the Beast\\" is the shortest story and merely describes the events that happen when a young female approaches a 'beast' - but is it described from the girl or the unicorn's point of view?<br /><br />\\"The Lady of Unicorn\\" is the last and longest story - longer in fact than all the previous stories put together! Once again the unicorn is only a co-star, as the action centres around Ethel, the young girl who was chosen to the be the Lady of the Unicorn, a young mascot of the community who has no power but all the appearance of it. Desperate to do something by herself, Ethel investigates Giant's Hill and meets the not-so-scary giant Alice, who introduces her to other creatures, cast out from their place in society because of their differences. The story creates some very poignant images of those outcast from the community - Alice and her friends because they scare people, and Ethel and the unicorn on the other end of the scale - alone and friendless because of their privileges. The two bands must work together though if they are to defeat the marauding troop of invading T'manians.<br /><br />All in all, this is a well written book that's sure to be a great success as a present for unicorn-crazy young girls, and its simple but descriptive prose is enjoyable to read aloud. Rather than being celebrated creatures, unicorns are portrayed more as outcasts, abandoned by their mothers and violently treated by other horses, a refreshing change from the majority of books who hold unicorns in great esteem. Jackie French creates some lovely descriptions of the harsh beauty of her country Australia, and on the whole has put together a thought-provoking collection of stories.witching and deliver antibiotics in the form of sweeties.

Most people are struck by the idea of the unicorn: its imagery, its meaning and its origins. Unfortunately in present times the striking and semi-dangerous idea of a horned, goat-legged, lion-tailed creature has been reduced to a sugary-sweet horsy (usually portrayed in various shades of pink or purple).<br /><br />Jane Yolen and Ruth Sanderson attempt to answer the question of where these animals disappeared to. The most popular story of where these creatures went to is found within the children's song, which tells how the unicorns were to proud to enter Noah's Ark and subsequently died. Legend tells that they went on to become the horned narwhal of the Artic Seas.<br /><br />Yolen and Sanderson keep the motif of the sea, but bring in a more contemporary theme of pollution and environmental destruction. For this reason, the unicorns travel to the ocean and merge with the water.<br /><br />It is a simple, but evocative story set in rhyme and illustrated by the wonderful Sanderson, who beautifully meld the figures of the unicorns with the facets of water: waves, foam, spray, and droplets. Though she does not *quite* portray the quintessential unicorn, this is a wonderful book: dreamy, poetic, and bittersweet.	2005-04-05

Keladry of Mindelin (or \\"Kel\\" to her friends ) has completed her first year of training to be a knight, and conquered the unfair probation that the training-master Wyldon inflicted on her. Now she hopes she can finally get on with her life-long dream of following in Lady-Knight Alanna's footsteps, and take the next step in becoming a knight of Tortall.<br /><br />But things are never as easy as that, and there are still those among her who are determined to see her fail. Yet, as in her first year, Kel is helped by old friends Neal, Merric, Owen, Cleon and Prince Roald, her stallion Peachblossom and the flock of friendly sparrows outside her window. As well as this are two new allies; the timid maid Lalasa whom Kel takes into her employment, and Jump the mongrel who has `adopted' Kel as his own. When the year starts the work begins, along with page-duties of serving the court, summer camps in the wilderness, skirmishes with bandits and the dreaded end-of-year exam. Should Kel fail, then she'll have to repeat her entire training...and it's the perfect opportunity for her enemies to sabotage her chances...<br /><br />\\"Page\\" is thicker, deeper and altogether better than its predecessor \\"First Test\\". Kel seems a bit more relaxed this time around, but still has her trademark qualities of calmness, loyalty, stoicism and her fear of heights - as I share this phobia I could certainly relate to her terror.<br /><br />There are some components of the book that make it more appropriate for slightly older readers; such as Kel's developing body and some allusions to sex which are mostly used in rather negative ways (Kel's virtue is questioned and Lalasa is assaulted), as well as some blood and gore on the battle field. Tamora Pierce is perhaps the only YA writer I know that openly discusses a woman's period in the context of a fantasy novel, and in this case Kel's monthlies are placed alongside her growing crush on Neal - all of which create a sense of realism that works wonderfully well compared to the magical elements of the story.<br /><br />In my review for \\"First Test\\", I described this series as being more in the way of the school story than a fantasy story. There is more magic and battles in this installment, but even now, there are still some homages to the old school-story genres found in Enid Blyton and J. K. Rowling's famous books; such as a young page who keeps using the word \\"jolly\\" and a range of school bullies (predominantly Joren, who bears a striking similarity to one Draco Malfoy - they even have the same hair colour!) Likewise there are other fun and familiar moments, such as Neal's long line of `true loves' - here is a young man who loves being in love more than any particular woman.<br /><br />Kel's story is growing nicely, and most will be eager to read \\"Squire\\", especially those that are familiar with Tortall and know that at the end of her training, the Ordeal is waiting for Kel...onderfully well compared to the magical elements of the story.  <br /> <br />In my review for \\"First Test\\", I described this series as being more in the way of the school story than a fantasy story.

Diana Wynne Jones is best known for her quirky books that combine magic with realistic, everyday people dealing with the problems that magic creates. Though some take place in parallel worlds, the general atmosphere of these books are contemporary and firmly grounded in reality. However, \\"Cart and Cwidder\\" is the first book in the Dalemark quartet that follows the more generic pattern of fantasy (war in a created world) - making it unique in Wynne Jones's canon of books, but a typical inclusion to the range of fantasy novels.<br /><br />Due to the conflict between north and south countries in the land of Dalemark, very few travellers move between them, with the exception of licensed musicians in their horse-drawn carts, entertaining the crowds wherever they stop. Dagner, Moril and Brid are the children of the singer Clennen and Lenina who are perfectly content to travel the lands, singing and passing on news across the lands. But then Moril's parents take on a new passenger named Kialan whom immediately rubs Moril up the wrong way. Between constant bickering, the three siblings, their parents and Kialan make their way northwards, but soon tragedy strikes and the four children are thrown into a series of chaotic and dangerous events. Inheriting the largest, oldest cwidder in the cart, Moril soon learns that it contains immense power, and with hostile forces closing in around them and Kialan's hidden identity revealed, Moril must learn to use this power in order to save him and the north.<br /><br />No book by Diana Wynne Jones could ever be truly bad, but \\"Cart and Cwidder\\" is certainly not the top of her game. Though it contains the same thoughtful commentary on human behaviour and clever twists, but it lacks the sparkle and wit of her many other books. The characters are not quite as vivid and interesting as the likes of Chrestomanci and Howl, and the story not quite as intriguing as those found in \\"The Power of Three\\" and \\"Black Maria\\".<br /><br />Yet for all of this, \\"Cart and Cwidder\\" is a worthwhile read if you have the next three volumes on hand, for the way in which Wynne Jones has created this series is immensely interesting (each one has a different situation and set of characters, yet are intricately connected).l of this, \\"Cart and Cwidder\\" is a worthwhile read if you have the next three volumes on hand, for the way in which Wynne Jones has created this series is immensely interesting (each one has a different situation and set of characters, yet are intricately connected). <br />	2005-04-05

Nat Fields is a young boy with a tragic family history who has just joined a new theatre group. Run by the eccentric Arby Babbage, Nat finds solace and escape from his past with the rehearsals of William Shakespeare's `A Midsummer Night's Dream'. Nat is to play the part of Puck, and despite some minor difficulties, Nat is happy with his role as an actor, especially as the director plans to make the performance as loyal as possible to the original performances (including having boys play the part of women).<br /><br />But then, after a terrible illness, Nat awakes to find himself in the past. He is in 1599, acting amongst Shakespeare's theatre troupe at the Globe Theatre. Once more Nat is in the role of Puck, but this time the performance is for the secret benefit of Queen Elizabeth herself. Nat's co-star is none other than Will Shakespeare himself, who brings a sense of calm and healing to Nat's painful past and his present condition.<br /><br />Dealing with his terrifying new surroundings, Nat looks to the theatre to help him cope with bullies, political intrigue, cultural differences and the sometimes brutal nature of England in another century. But haunting him throughout is the question: why is he here? And is he ever going to return to his contemporary world?<br /><br />Susan Cooper is the award-winning fantasy author of \\"The Dark is Rising\\" sequence, which remains her best work. Though \\"King of Shadows\\" is a pleasant enough read, it doesn't really stand out as an essential inclusion of the time-slip or fantasy genre. The presentation of the Elizabethan era is done very well, and I couldn't spot any inconsistencies or historical faults (not that I'm an expert on the subject). Furthermore, Cooper uses  real historical characters and situations in both the past and present, predominately the real figure of Nat Field of 1599 and the reconstruction of the Globe Theatre by Sam Wanamaker in 1999. And of course Queen Elizabeth and William Shakespeare, who are brought to vivid, realistic life. All this combines to make \\"King of Shadows\\" a learning experience as well as an enjoyable read.

J. Smith's `Night World' series, concerning the secret world of supernatural creatures that live among normal human beings. Called the Night World, there are several rules imposed upon the witches, vampires, werewolves and shape shifters that inhabit this world, namely that they are to never tell a human being about their secret society, and never to fall in love with one of them.<br /><br />This is the first book in the series to deal with witches rather than vampires, and concerns the lives of two seventeen year old witch cousins who made their first appearance in \\"Secret Vampire\\": Thea and Blaise Harman. The two girls are complete opposites; Thea is fair and quiet, whilst Blaise is black-haired and someone who enjoys playing with the human world for fun - making boys fall in love with her and then discarding them. After a series of expulsions from high schools around the country (the last one having resulted in the school burning down), the cousins are brought to live with their grandmother Edgith Harman - the Crone of All the Witches, a prestigious position within the Circles of Night World witches. In other words, the cousins are on thin ice.<br /><br />But Blaise doesn't trouble herself with things like this - she's always played her love games and doesn't plan on stopping now. Thea however, is desperate to live a quiet, peaceful life. But then she finds her soul mate: Eric Ross, a human. Their connection is powerful, but Thea knows that should they be discovered, it could result in executions for both of them, or in war among the factions of the Night World. When Blaise finds out about Thea's feelings, she decides the only way in which to act is to separate the two of them: by using her own charms to divert Eric's attention away from Thea...<br /><br />The blurb would have you believe that Blaise is an out-and-out villain, and the focus of the story is on the two girls fighting over Eric's affections. This however is not so - the main conflict in the story comes from Thea's attempts to protect Eric by summoning up a benevolent spirit. However, when the spell goes wrong, Thea finds that a murderous witch-ghost is on the loose, and perfectly capable of killing. As well as this there are numerous sub-plots, including Edgith's failing health, Blaise's exploits at her new high school, a few spells and meetings with other witches, Thea's various attempts to allure/dispel Eric's affections and an introduction to Eric's family and his radical-feminist little sister.<br /><br />All this equals a rather slip-shod plot that slides all over the place. It's not that the story isn't interesting, but L. J. Smith doesn't seem quite sure on where it's going, or where the true conflict lies. Instead it comes across as a series of magical events and workings that don't quite have the urgency and suspense of other books in the series - especially the later ones.<br /><br />Furthermore, many of the plot points and characters in the book were rather familiar - Smith has been recycling her own work, most particularly \\"The Secret Circle\\" trilogy. Blaise and Thea are almost identical to Faye and Diana (and both sets were cousins!) whilst things like the vengeful spirit, the death of a school student and the forbidden love affair all have their counterpoints in this previous trilogy. As such, the story has a lack of originality (and the coupling of Thea and Eric doesn`t come across as *that* genuine).<br /><br />But there are some nice touches throughout: we get another piece of the ever-growing history of the Night World (this time it's the story of Hellewise and Maya), some names of other characters that have either been in previous books or will pop up in later ones (such as Aradia, Ash, Quinn and Thierry) that make the book feel like a small part of a larger whole. Smith also makes good use of folklore and mythology, weaving little bits of `real' legends and practices into what the characters say and do - like the Cup of Lethe or the many allusions to Aphrodite.<br /><br />All in all, not a bad contribution to the 'Night World' series, though by no means the best: things only get really interesting when we hit book five: \\"The Chosen\\".practices into what the characters say and do - like the Cup of Lethe or the many allusions to Aphrodite. <br /> <br />All in all, not a bad contribution to the 'Night World' series, though by no means the best: things only get really interesting when we hit book five: \\"The Chosen\\".    <br />	2005-04-05

This volume is the second in a four-part series called \\"Circle of Magic\\" and is also titled \\"The Power in the Storm\\". Set in a fantasy realm over a one-year period, Tamora Pierce tells the story of four young mages who are brought together to live at the temple community of Winding Circle, to control and properly use their various powers.<br /><br />The children couldn't be more different, but their studies bring them closer together till they are bonded magically (unbeknown to their four mentors), each sharing in the other's unique magic. Pierce claims that her inspiration comes from the olde-world handicrafts that are dying from our own world, such as weaving and metalcraft. Such things are channelled through into the mage's powers, with the exception of Tris who is a 'weather witch' and can hear voices on the wind.<br /><br />Summersea is still recovering from the earthquake of the previous book, but the damage done to the harbour defences mean that Winding Circle is vulnerable to pirates. The children at Disciple Cottage are called upon to help strengthen the damaged buildings, and it is then that the pirates appear on the seas - and they have their eyes fixed on the riches of the temple. Once again, it comes down the children to rescue their beloved home - which isn't easy considering their is a betrayer in their midst...<br /><br />The tension and claustrophobia of the temple is vividly created, and the pain that the pirates caused heartbreaking. Most of the action concerns the mages and their teachers preparing the defences, though I have to say that when the climactic moment comes, it's over rather quickly. The turncoat within Winding Circle is obvious, and the subplot involving Tris caring for a baby bird is interesting, but a little needless.<br /><br />However, the human element is something that Pierce is great at capturing and she does so here extremely well. Tris is a wonderful character, and perhaps the most vivid and interesting of all four of the children. Plump, with glasses, red frizzy hair and a bad temper, this bookworm has a prickly personality that often puts her at odds with most people, and she infinitely prefers a book to human company. Estranged from her unloving family, she is only now beginning to open up to the feelings of human affection. But it doesn't help that the weather churns up whenever she looses her temper.<br /><br />Each book also explore one of the friendships between the four, and this one mostly concerns Briar and Tris. The fact that such opposites, from such different walks of life can become friends is immensely touching. The other two children have segments of the book dedicated to them, and the bond between all of them is deep and realistic.<br /><br />Not the best Pierce has to offer, and yet still a pleasant read with Pierce's ability to create the shades of grey in what could easily be a black and white novel.of the children.

As a scholar who has studied and taught J. R. R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy for twenty-five years, there are very probably very few better qualified to write an introductory book on the subject than Michael Stanton. He's obviously a great fan on the book (that is, he does not seem to be simply trying to cash in on the recent popularity that the movies have caused) and writes in a simple, chatty style that is easy for most non-academics to understand. For those who are more experienced in reading essays and critiques, \\"Hobbits, Wizards and Elves\\" may come across as either too simplistic or repetitive - and I admit that there was very little here that I hadn't already come across in more comprehensive essays on this subject.<br /><br />But Stanton is well aware of this, and has no delusions about what it is that he's writing - in fact on many occasions he encourages other authors that go deeper into the text, and often apologises for his `bare-bones' treatment of the subject. To like the author's own voice makes up a great part of one's enjoyment of these exploratory books, and there's nothing pretentious or overtly opinionated in Stanton's techniques.<br /><br />In saying that however, this is a book for beginners to the world of Tolkien - long time studiers or fanatical fans will know all this stuff already - and probably through their own readings of the book. Yet for those starting out, or those that need a helping hand in grasping the finer details of Tolkien's great work, this is a readable and clear-cut `helpmeet' to \\"the Lord of the Rings\\".<br /><br />In Part One of the book Stanton gives us a (very) brief biographical account of Tolkien's life and his inspiration for the book, and the publishing history, followed by a chapter devoted to the geography, history and themes that make up Middle-Earth. The bulk of the book is taken up with accounts of the six books that make up the complete \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\", \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Return of the King.\\" This is perhaps the most interesting part (at least for me), as he explores the meanings and finer details of the chapters and the events and characters within them.<br /><br />Part Two divides up the `species' of Middle Earth and explores their cultures closer: Elves, Dwarves, Ents, Humankind (including Hobbits) and the forces of evil are all discussed separately, and then finally Tolkien's use of language (undoubtedly the basis of the entire saga) and the use of dreams and spirituality throughout the story.<br /><br />Lastly comes a chapter on the Peter Jackson version of \\"the Fellowship of the Ring\\" that is enthusiastically advertised by the publishers on the front cover: \\"includes a new essay on the first part of \\"the Lord of the Rings\\" film trilogy!\\" As it turns out, this is the most unnecessary parts of the book, and I couldn't help but feel that Stanton was either coerced into doing this for the benefit of sales, or was simply a little `pet-project' of his that he wanted to sneak in. As it is, it is not an `essay' at all, but simply a list of opinions concerning the movie that nearly verges into being a movie review. As you may have guessed, the absence of Tom Bombadil and the role of Arwen are mentioned, as are a few other little nitpicks, but at least Stanton appreciates Sean Bean's role as Boromir - a performance that I believe is often overlooked by viewers.<br /><br />He's not afraid to criticise certain portions of the book (he points out that only three of five wizards sent to Middle Earth are identified, and that Tolkien puts the title of `oldest living thing in Middle Earth' on two separate characters: Tom Bombadil and Treebeard), and to go against popular fan speculation (in his opinion the `unsung hero' of the story is not Samwise Gamgee, but Prince Imrahil) but on the whole you can tell that he simply adores Tolkien's work and has read it multiple times.<br /><br />He also points out some interesting titbits that are obvious in hindsight,but which were overlooked by me in my own reading of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" - such as the fact that Pippin is the only character in the book to directly converse with Sauron.<br /><br />It is not a thick book, nor a very deep one, but it is interesting nonetheless and would be valuable to those just beginning to explore Tolkien's world. I've been exploring for a few years now, and I still found some interesting theories and explanations - but then I brought this book at the University's book store for only two dollars, so I'm hardly going to take a harsh view of something brought so cheaply. Any one well-versed in Tolkien's universe has more comprehensive works to explore, but beginners are most welcome here.s in hindsight, but which were overlooked by me in my own reading of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" - such as the fact that Pippin is the only character in the book to directly converse with Sauron. <br /> <br />It is not a thick book, nor a very deep one, but it is interesting nonetheless and would be valuable to those just beginning to explore Tolkien's world.

Throughout Tamora Pierce's range of fantasy books, the \\"Protector of the Small\\" quartet is unique, mainly because it is not primary a fantasy series, but a school story - more akin to the likes of Enid Blyton's \\"Naughtiest Girl in the School\\" or \\"Mallory Towers.\\" This may seem like an odd thing to say, but on close inspection I think you'll find it's true. Though there are fantasy element present, the main narrative of the book is concerned with topic that you find in other books of the school-story genre (including 'Harry Potter'), including school bullies, malevolent teachers, homework assignments, camaraderie among peers, \\"hazing\\" younger students, and even sporting tournaments (though Pierce replaces cricket or Quidditch with jousting and sword fighting).<br /><br />Ten-year old Keladry of Mindelin (or 'Kel' as she's known to her friends) is the first girl in ten years to apply for training as a knight in the realm of Tortall. Determined to follow in the footsteps of her hero Alanna the Lioness, Kel is eager to begin her training amongst the other young recruits. She seems cut out for the role considering that she's been raised among the stoic, war-like Yamanis.<br /><br />But things are not so rosy once she gets to Tortall. Her training-master Lord Wyldon is not happy about her presence there and has forced King Jonathan to place Kel under a one-year probation: if she can't keep up with the boys, then she's out. Furthermore, her fellow trainees scorn and mock her, and a few in particular are determined to send her packing.<br /><br />Kel however, is determined to see her training through to the end, and soon finds things to enjoy about her rigorous program. She befriends the wise-cracking Neal, finds a kindred spirit in her bad-tempered stallion Peachblossom and has an entourage of sparrow companions that come in very handy in a fix. But why is Lady Alanna ignoring her? And will she survive her probation come the end of the year?<br /><br />\\"The Protector of the Small\\" quartet is also different due to the nature of Kel herself. Unlike all of Pierce's previous heroines, Kel does not have any magical gifts that can aid her in her struggles. Unlike Alanna (and other heroines in similar stories) Kel cannot fall back on magical powers or disguises to ease her toils, but must instead work for all that she accomplishes. Pierce is extremely successful in capturing this physicality to Kel's journey: we share every aching muscle, every black eye, every saddle-sore backside.<br /><br />For those familiar with other 'Tortall' books, there are some nice cameos from several old characters: the most important are from Daine and members of the royal family, but also keep your eyes out for Lindhall Reed, Bonedancer, Tkaa the basilisk, Sir Myles, Stefan and a hilarious episode with an absent-minded Numair.<br /><br />Despite the differences between this and the other Tortall books by Tamora Pierce, it is an interesting and rewarding read.

So says the note that Mr Crossley finds hidden between the exercise books in class 2Y. In any other world, this would be seen as a harmless joke, but at Larwood House for witch orphans, in a world run by Inquisitors and where witch-burnings still take place, such things are taken deadly seriously. Who is the witch? Chubby Nan Pilgrim, named after the most famous Arch-Witch? Sullen Charles Morgan, who holds a sympathetic view toward witches? Or weird Brian Wentworth, who behaviour gets stranger by the day?<br /><br />Then the anonymous witch starts having some fun - a flock of exotic birds in music class, a removal of all the shoes in the school. The hunt is on among students and teachers to find the culprit, with the threat of the merciless Inquisitors visiting the school at the back of all their minds. But as the mystery deepens, several of the students seem to find that they themselves have magical powers, and that any one of them could be arrested for witchcraft and burnt at the stake. They'll  need some expert help...<br /><br />\\"Witch Week\\" is part of the Chrestomanci quartet, though unlike \\"Charmed Life\\" and \\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\", Chrestomanci is not a main character, and in fact does not appear until over halfway through the book. In this way, it is more like \\"The Magicians of Caprona\\", where Chrestomanci appears as a powerful, helpful figure to sort out the problem at hand (with a little help from the children, of course).<br /><br />Diana Wynne Jones is almost *too* good at creating the atmosphere and feeling of boarding school for these young people, where even the misfits are at odds with each other rather than banding together to oppose the Theresas and Simons of the school. Each student is a little gem of character study, whether it be the perfect Theresa and her `new crazes' (in this case, it's knitting), Charles and the complicated code he makes in order to demonstrate how much he hates the school, or Brian's complete and utter selfishness.<br /><br />Likewise, are Wynne Jones's humorous moments of vivid human life - such as Theresa's friends escorting her to detention, but abruptly abandoning her when the teacher invites them to join her, or Nan wishing she was dead, then realising that with the Inquisitors coming she may very well end up dead...and immediately realising that she *doesn't* want to be dead. Make no mistake, these students are thoroughly miserable, and Larwood House is a long way from Hogwarts.<br /><br />And I mention Hogwarts, since Diana Wynne Jones's novels are undoubtedly the most influential books in the creation of J. K. Rowling's \\"Harry Potter\\" series, especially \\"Witch Week\\" in its use of a boarding school with magical pupils. If you consider yourself a loyal follower of \\"Harry Potter\\", then this book should be read - Rowling's books have more intricate mysteries, but Wynne Jones is right up there with Rowling in terms of clever twists - an example here, is how a foolish spell ends up being vital in the saving of the world. Furthermore, Rowling tends to be more sentimental, and Wynne Jones has not an ounce of this in her books - they are (despite the magical workings) realistic to the core, and written in Wynne Jones's droll, almost sarcastic narrative.<br /><br />So not every fan of \\"Harry Potter\\" might necessarily enjoy these books, but for those trying to extend their reading, look into the literary history of Potter, are fans of Diana Wynne Jones, or just want a funny, sinister and clever read, look no further than \\"Witch Week\\". However, I do suggest reading either \\"Charmed Life\\" or \\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\" beforehand - it'll give you a clearer idea of who Chrestomanci is and what he does.hness.  <br />Likewise, are Wynne Jones's humorous moments of vivid human life - such as Theresa's friends escorting her to detention, but abruptly abandoning her when the teacher invites them to join her, or Nan wishing she was dead, then realising that with the Inquisitors coming she may very well end up dead...and immediately realising that she *doesn't* want to be dead.

Lloyd Alexander's fantastic five-part Chronicles of Prydain begins with \\"The Book of Three\\", which is required reading for anyone who considers themselves a fantasy fan and/or a lover of children's literature - or in fact anyone who love a darn good book. And you can't stop there - make sure you have on hand the following volumes: \\"The Black Cauldron\\", \\"The Castle of Llyr\\", \\"Taran Wanderer\\" and \\"The High King.\\" Three of them have won or been nominated for the Newbery Award, and are loved by readers all over the world; they belong on the shelf next to `The Lord of the Rings' and `The Chronicles of Narnia' in terms of how beloved they have become.<br /><br />The series takes place in the mythical land of Prydain, a land of Alexander's own invention, but with many stylistic and legendary qualities borrowed from Wales' mythological traditions, as found in `The Mabinogian'. Elements such as the Fair Folk, the black cauldron and the oracular pig, and characters such as Gwydion and Arawn are taken from real sources, and as such give the books a depth and resonance that is often missing from other fantasy books in which the authors make up the entire world themselves (or, as is more likely, copy from Tolkien). The over-riding story arc throughout the book is the battle between good and evil as waged by the evil Dark Lord Arawn and the heroic Children of Don, as seen through the eyes of a young Assistant Pig-Keeper - Taran of Caer Dallben.<br /><br />It sounds like a standard fantasy-fare, but Alexander infuses his work with delightful humour and wit, the afore mentioned shadow of Welsh legends, and colourful characters that are instantly taken to heart. Furthermore, he often puts more emphasis on the everyday vices and struggles of mankind rather than the more epic figures of good and evil, making the books more intimate and personal. The main struggle is encapsulated with Taran, a young boy living with the enchanter Dallben and the blacksmith Coll in a simple cottage. He dreams of glory and battle, but instead must spend his days tending Hen Wen, a white oracular pig. One day however, quite out of the blue he finds himself in the middle of an adventure, when a terrified Hen Wen flees into the forest, with Taran straight after her.<br /><br />Arawn's most feared warlord, the Horned King, is gathering an army to march against the Children of Don's stronghold, Caer Dathyl, and Taran soon finds himself caught up in the race to find Hen Wen before the Horned King and warn Caer Dathyl. On the way he meets with many allies and enemies: the talkative Princess Elionwy, the wandering bard-king Fflewddur Fflam (and his magical harp that snaps a string every time he lies), the bad-tempered dwarf Doli and the strange half-man, half-animal creature named Gurgi. From the sinister Spiral Castle, to the peace of Medwyn's valley to the mystery of the underground kingdom of the Fair Folk, Taran leads his odd company - hopefully towards a victorious end.<br /><br />Taran is a wonderful protagonist - full of lofty dreams and valour at the beginning, and gradually learning as the story progresses that war is not so glorious, and the burden of responsibility and leadership is a heavy one. Alexander constantly slaps him down, usually through the irrepressible Princess Elionwy, one of the most wonderful heroines of all time. Lessons about life, love, honour, loss, and tragedy are all contained within the story, but not so much that they become too preachy or overwhelming for younger readers. Alexander has a deft hand when it comes to incorporating such themes into his story, and balancing out these hefty messages with a healthy dose of humour (again, usually at the cost of Taran).<br /><br />If you have never ventured into Prydain before, then prepared to read a series of truly excellent books that you'll treasure forever. It goes without saying that `the Chronicles of Prydain' have my very highest recommendation.He dreams of glory and battle, but instead must spend his days tending Hen Wen, a white oracular pig.

By now the formula to the \\"Keys to the Kingdom\\" series is in place - taking place over a week-long period (with each book chronicling a day) young Arthur Penhaligon travels into the mystical realm of \\"the House\\" in order to find seven pieces of a torn Will. This Will was destroyed by the personified Days of the Week (or the `Morrow Days'), each of whom embody one of the seven deadly sins. Arthur has already defeated Mister Monday's sloth and Grim Tuesday's greed, and now comes up against Drowned Wednesday's terrible gluttony. By doing this, Arthur hopes to bring order once more to the House, in accordance with the instructions left by the Architect (the world's Creator) in the Will she left behind.<br /><br />There's a lot more to it than that, so I strongly suggest reading \\"Mister Monday\\" and \\"Grim Tuesday\\" before this one, as Garth Nix's storylines are rather complicated - though not so complicated that it's not accessible to young readers. Once more Nix brings fresh new ideas to the fantasy genre, as well as a twisting plot, colourful characters and a brave protagonist who has now decided to take matters into his own hands.<br /><br />From his hospital bed Arthur is set adrift on a stormy sea, along with Leaf, his new friend from the previous books. He's back in the realm of the House, and has a luncheon meeting with Lady Wednesday before him - and given his experience with the other Morrow Days, he's not looking forward to it. Separated from Leaf, and marked out by the terrible pirate Feverfew, Arthur meets an array of more unusual characters - such as the suspicious Doctor Scamandros and the untrustworthy Raised Rats (the rats that were spirited away by the Pied Piper of Hamilton). Now he must find a way to rescue Leaf and attain the next part of the Will - but who can he really trust?<br /><br />Once more Nix fills his books with allusions to myths, legends and other famous stories - here in particular he shows his regard for Herman Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\", and characters both old and new turn up to join in the adventure - in particular the irrepressible Suzy Turquoise Blue. Drowned Wednesday in particular gets a different treatment than the other Morrow Days, portrayed as a victim rather than an antagonist - the role of villain goes to the pirate Feverfew.<br /><br />Unfortunately, `Drowned Wednesday' was not as enjoyable as the last two books - a sense of invention and magic was missing this time around, though there is still plenty to explore. The Border Seas were simply not as interesting to me as the previous settings; Arthur spends most of his time on ships and submarines - I either wanted to go back to the myriad of rooms of the House or onto the tantalising named and often-mentioned `Great Maze' and `Incomparable Gardens'.<br /><br />Nix seems obsessed with giving poor Arthur as many injuries as possible (rest assured, had he been in the real world, he would not have survived all the gashes, broken limbs and asthma attacks he experiences here),and often tension is created through near-escapes and close encounters - nothing like the battles and competitions of the other books. \\"Drowned Wednesday\\" is therefore not quite as gripping as the previous instalments - but I can only be critical in comparison with other Nix books, since \\"Drowned Wednesday\\" is still much better than many other children's fantasy out there, and I`m eagerly awaiting \\"Sir Tuesday\\".<br /><br />And does anyone else think that the name `Arthur Penhaligon' is a little too similar to `Arthur Pendragon' to be a coincidence?k\\", and characters both old and new turn up to join in the adventure - in particular the irrepressible Suzy Turquoise Blue.

I can't tell you how refreshing it was to read a fantasy novel for adults that was not yet another \\"Lord of the Rings\\" rip-off. Instead, Susanna Clarke treats us to a story filled with magicians, folklore, fairies, footnotes and creatures from her own imagination that enrich the pages of her first novel. Perhaps her only similarity to Tolkien is her skill in making us believe that the events she describes are true occurrences, helped by her extensive use of footnotes, grounding in real folklore and enlightened, chatty prose. The next time you read of the Napoleonic War you may be surprised to find nothing of Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell in the sources.<br /><br />Set between 1806 and 1817, \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\\" tells the story of these two gentlemen magicians and their attempts to bring magic back into England and to magically assist the government in the war against Napoleon. After Mr Norrell proves to the country that he can indeed perform magical feats, he takes Jonathan Strange as his pupil. Eventually however, they find that they are too different to work together: Mr Norrell believes that magic is a studious, secret thing and keeps all his magical books locked away in a library. Strange however, thinks that magic should be shared and explored, and is attracted to the most perilous and dangerous magic that there is. Their biggest difference concerns the Raven King, a human child stolen and raised by fairies before coming back to conquer northern England. Though his reign ended hundreds of years ago, Norrell detests him and Strange adores him...and there are signs he has not quite left England...<br /><br />They are also surrounded by many other characters; wives, patrons, servants, friends and associates, most of whom have their own interconnecting stories throughout the story. This is perhaps one of the most rewarding parts of reading the book: the different threads of narratives that seem random and unconnected, but which exquisitely join together as the story reaches its end. Clarke does not spoon-fed the reader what he/she needs to know - if you want to unravel the various mysteries and intrigues, then you'll have to pay close attention to what's going on.<br /><br />Clarke speaks with a delicate narrative voice that is much akin to what you'll find in Jane Austen and other books published in this period, and she often addresses the reader directly, making it quite a personal read. Her use of footnotes is wonderful - every time a character mentions a book , a theory or story, she'll footnote more information concerning it, which once again gives the feeling that you're reading an historic account of these people's actions. Furthermore is her use of `real' fairy lore, such as the capturing of human beings into the realm of Faery. Best of all, there's none of this `sparkly, pretty, rainbows-and-flowers' fairy rubbish - these fairies are as they're meant to be - mysterious, sinister and capable of much destruction.<br /><br />Likewise, key historical events and figures, such as Napoleon, Wellington and Byron are included, and the story stretches from London, to the English countryside, to Italy, all of which is described in beautiful detail. Moments of intrigue - from the murder of a girl with ivy in her hair to an old woman who can only speak in cat - are scattered throughout, and exist only to add beauty and mystery to the overall novel. Such episodes are wonderful to read and ponder over.<br /><br />One thing that must be said though, is that it is a very unique book in terms of plotting. Though a climax to the tension does come (eventually), Clarke is content to explore the everyday life of the magicians and their associates, with the underlying mystery rearing its head on instances few and far between. This may not appeal to some; others may enjoy the slow meandering and subversive feel of the plot - that something sinister is going on beneath the more everyday occurrences. Another slight fault is themain characters themselves: although they are realistic and interesting, at times they do not come across as very nice people. Strange is certainly more sympathetic than Norrell, but he does not fully turn up till midway through the story.<br /><br />This is one of the most enjoyable reading experiences I've had in a long time: at different points thoughtful, original, clever, humorous, poignant and even scary! In a genre that is made up mostly of magic swords, dark lords, plucky young heroes and all the other fantasy cliches, \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\\" is a welcome relief. If only all such authors took the same care and creativity with their novels that Susanna Clarke does with hers.fault is the main characters themselves: although they are realistic and interesting, at times they do not come across as very nice people.

Unlike her other series, which deal with battles, magic, fantasy creatures, revolution and politics, \\"Briar's Book\\" centres something very mundane by comparison: a plague. Yet Pierce incorporates within the story all her powerful themes of love and friendship, pain and suffering, grief and hope, and humanity's capabilities for both good and evil that make her one of the best YA fantasy writers out there.<br /><br />Briar Moss (who is unique among the cannon of Pierce's books considering he is her only male protagonist thus far) has spent almost a year at Discipline Cottage, Winding Circle and out of all of the young mages gathered there, he has changed the most. Once a street rat that picked pockets for a living, he is now happily installed in the temple community, under the tutelage of Rosethorn in the art of growing and maintaining plants. He loves Sandry, Tris and Daja as if they were his sisters, and enjoys the material benefits that the community provides him with.<br /><br />One afternoon, when accompanying Rosethorn into Summersea to restock supplies at Urda's House  (a hospital for the poor), Briar is called away by his old street friends. Following them down into the sewers he discovers his particular friend Flic is seriously ill. After informing Rosethorn the situation escalates, and soon Briar finds himself in quarantine at Urda's house as more and more patients of the Blue Pox are brought in. Whilst Briar and Rosethorn tend the sick in the city with minimal supplies and little help, the Winding Circle community are doing their best to find a cure and replenish the medicines available.<br /><br />But the death toll keeps rising and no one seems to be any closer in discovering a cure. When a way of identifying the disease is finally discovered, Briar is finally allowed to return home - only for one of his nearest and dearest to get the Pox...<br /><br />Pierce is excellent in creating the growing despair and panic of the city, the claustrophobia of Briar in quarantine, and the frantic efforts of Winding Circle's healers. As well as this is Briar's inner struggles; both with the patients and with his growing reluctance to spend time in the grime and muck of his former life. Pierce is always good at capturing human emotion and thought, and here she is at her peak. Throughout the course of the story there are many moments of insight into the human mind during this crisis - but for me to describe them here wouldn't be doing them justice. Some readers may be frustrated at the slow pace and lack of magical components that usually make up Pierce's books, but the patient reader will  be justly rewarded.<br /><br />The bond between the four children and their teachers is palatable, and you can really feel their pain at their separation, and the joy of their reunion. Things as small as a hug, a smile or a hand holding up a bowl for their loved one to vomit into is how Pierce captures their affection for each other - and which all capture more meaning than any long-winded speeches about friendship and loyalty that other author's write. Especially touching is the bond between Briar and his stern and bad-tempered teacher Rosethorn - but I'll let you discover that for yourself.

Garth Nix's \\"Mister Monday\\" begins a brand new fantasy series in the \\"Keys to the Kingdom\\" series. This Australian author is fast-becoming one of the biggest names in fantasy with his reinvention of the genre and his intricate, fascinating plots. Unlike other such authors, who place their heroes in a medieval realm of magical swords, horse-back riding and dragons, Nix follows the example of writers such as Philip Pullman, Susanna Clarke and (to a lesser degree) J. K. Rowling by creating a more contemporary fantasy-world with the flavours and style of the 18th and 19th centuries. Where his \\"Seventh Tower\\" book was written for younger readers, and \\"Abhorsen\\" trilogy for teenagers (though many adults got in on the act), \\"The Keys to the Kingdom\\" are situated smack dab in the centre of these two age groups - though again, I hope this doesn't prevent people of any age group from reading them.<br /><br />The Epicentre of the Universe is a realm known as \\"The House\\" - a labyrinth of rooms and halls and fantastical landscapes, that are ruled over by the treacherous Trustees, or as they are more commonly known, the Morrow Days. Their task was to take over the supervision of our world (or `The Secondary Realms') from the creator - the Architect, who left Her instructions written in a Will, to be carried out accordingly. But the Days tore the Will into seven pieces and scattered the scraps across the known worlds to be guarded forever more, and only now - thousands of years later - has one fragment of the Will managed to escape...<br /><br />Meanwhile, in the ordinary world, Arthur Penhaligon is coping with the pressures of the first day at a new school. Forced to go on a cross-country run  - even though he has severe asthma - Arthur soon finds himself lagging behind, and eventually collapses on the lawn. Whilst his classmates run for help, the strangest thing happens: a young man and his butler appear from nowhere, and bequeath to Arthur something that they call a \\"Key\\" (though to Arthur it looks more like a large minute hand from a clock), and a strange book called `The Compleat Atlas of the House and Immediate Environs'. But when a fight emerges between the two figures - Mister Monday and Sneezer - they both disappear without any further regard to Arthur.<br /><br />And from there, things just get stranger. A giant House has appeared on the block that only Arthur can see, and ugly dog-faced men in bowler hats are coming after him. Worse of all is the outbreak of a mysterious illness that puts the whole community into quarantine and Arthur's own family in danger. Seeing no other way of helping, Arthur travels to the House, uses his key, and enters its domain... Arthur has been chosen by the Will to become Heir to the Kingdom and set right the corruption that is destroying management of the realm.<br /><br />What follows is an amazing adventure throughout a world chock-full of danger, intrigue, invention and surprises. The House is one of the most colourful places you could ever wish to visit, complete with everything from elevators to dinosaurs to coal cellars. Nix delights in playing with words and concepts, and the phases \\"got a frog in your throat\\" and \\"having a silver tongue\\" take on whole new meaning here, and things such as books, paper, the written word and language are given a solid, tangible quality here that is thought-provoking and completely original. Old legends are given new life (such as the tale of the Pied Piper and the Greek myth of Prometheus) and concepts and symbols given real form: such as the days of the week in human form, and their angelic-looking (but quite devilish) Dawn, Noon and Dusks.<br /><br />Throughout, Arthur is a sympathetic, understandable protagonist, who reacts to his adventures in a way that you'd expect a young boy to do, but with extraordinary resilience and courage, as does his young sidekick Suzy Turquoise Blue. All other characters are vivid and interesting, both good and bad, and immenselymemorable. Also, Nix sprinkles little hints and clues to the next books throughout the text, so read carefully!<br /><br />The book suffers little from the amount of ideas and concepts that Nix crams between its covers, which can seem either random or confusing to a first-time reader. By the time they get on to the next books, the general formula of where Nix is going is straightened out and most of the things Arthur sees and hears of in this first book are understandable (which should justify a second reading!) Make sure \\"Grim Tuesday\\" is on hand to continue Arthur's story.nd immensely memorable.

US	39424751	R134H5WWR8OJFC	0375814671	98396819	Trickster's Queen (Daughter of the Lioness, Book 2)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	"Let the Games Begin..."	\\"Trickster's Queen\\" is the sequel to Tamora Pierce's \\"Trickster's Choice\\" and (so far) the first set of books that are not quartets, but a simple duet. It is also by far her longest book, and in her acknowledgements she credits that toJ. K. Rowling due to the fact that the Harry Potter books are so thick. Both books take place in Pierce's `Tortall' universe, though are situated on the Copper Isles rather than Tortall as in the `Alanna', `Immortals' and `Protector of the Small' quartets - which I recommend you read before tackling these books just to have the proper background and history of Pierce's characters and worlds (these two books are also the only books to contain a glossary and cast of characters - proof of how complicated they're getting).<br /><br />Beginning where the first book ended, we are once more introduced to Aly of Tortall, the daughter of Alanna the King's Champion and George Cooper the King's Spymaster, who has been chosen by the trickster god Kyprioth to aid a rebellion in the Copper Isles for the oppressed dark-skinned raka against the white-skinned luarin; in particular the ruthless Rittevon regents. Aly is situated in the Balitang household with Lady Saraiya and Dovasary, two `twice-royal' young women who are considered the prophesied queen that will reclaim the throne for its original people. Building up a network of spies around her, Aly begins to plan revolution against the ruthless Rubinyan and Imajane, helped with the god Kyprioth himself and his crow minions - including the crow-turned-man Nawat whom she harbours romantic feelings for.<br /><br />As mentioned, \\"Trickster's Queen\\" is Tamora Pierce's longest and most complicated book - it is immensely difficult to keep track of the vast range of characters, most with unpronounceable names. There are some portions that drag, and the tension is not quite as high (for me anyway) as the situations found in the `Alanna' and `Immortals' books. But for the first time we have a protagonist that is easy-going and laidback rather than focussed and driven, and Aly is a loveable, enjoyable heroine, and definitely the product of Alanna and George: with her mother's determination and steel and her father's wit and cunning. Likewise the Balitang family: Winnamine, her aunt Nuritin, and Sarai and Dove are interesting, realistic characters that make us care about them and their situations, and Nawat (who had finally stopped trying to feed Aly bugs) is adorably sweet.<br /><br />The story once again proves that Pierce is one of the masters of both YA and fantasy books as she creates an exotic tropical world (far from the usual medieval horses-and-swords environment of other fantasy novels) and finding the shades of grey in what could be a very black and white battle between good and evil. Tamora Pierce tends to concentrate on the human elements of her stories rather than the magical ones, and throughout the book many difficult choices are made that test the moral standards of her characters. Should justice and revolution result in the death of the child king? Should a young noblewoman follow her heart or live for her kingdom? Should a leader stay behind for the greater good whilst they send others out to fight? These are but some of the issues that Pierce raises in a story that does not glamorise or glorify death or battle.<br /><br />If you are fans of the previous books then you will be treated to cameo appearances from Tkaa the basilisk, the Graveyard Hag and the odd creatures known as darkings last seen in \\"Realms of the Gods\\", who come in extremely handy for Aly's spy games. Furthermore, there is a fun reunion at the conclusion of the book, and anyone who has read the `Immortals' quartet may feel immensely touched at the names Daine and Numair have chosen for their children (who hopefully will end up as protagonists in later Tortall books).<br /><br />All in all, this is an essential read for the Pierce fan, though not one I would recommend for the newcomer toPierce's writings - start back at her earlier works. Pierce obviously did her research in terms of spy-craft and political manoeuvring, and \\"Trickster's Queen\\" may very well be considered her most sophisticated and complex novel.ewcomer to Pierce's writings - start back at her earlier works.

Now returning from his journey of self-discovery in \\"Taran Wanderer\\", he is eager to be home, especially since Princess Elionwy has returned from the Isles of Mona. Soon everyone is reunited in the cottages of Caer Dallben, which is a special treat if you've read the previous books as everyone is there: Gwydion, Fflewddur Fflam, Gurgi, Doli, Llyan, Kaw, Hen Wen, Glew, Rhun, Coll, Hen Wen - you name it and they're there. Predominantly among them is the conquered enchantress Achren - a shadowy figure who despises Arawn and has her own secret plans to have her vengeance.<br /><br />But Arawn has struck sooner than the good guys intended, and the magical black sword Dyrnwyn has been stolen. Now Taran is swept up once more on an adventure that's way over his head. Guided by the mysterious prophesy of the oracular pig and devastated by a betrayal amongst the allied forces, Taran gathers together the people of the Free Commots and begins a dangerous journey through the mountains to reach Annuvin in time to help Gwydion's fleet. On the way we re-met every possible character we've ever met in Prydain - Magg, Gwystyl, Eiddileg, Smoit, Medwyn, Dorath, Melynlas, all the common folk from \\"Taran Wanderer\\", and of course Orddu, Orwen and Orgoch - Alexander hasn't missed a single one, and they all have important and meaningful parts to play.<br /><br />Previously, the books have been told solely from Taran's point of view, but now for the first time we see events through the eyes of other characters - everyone from Elionwy to Dallben to Kaw gets a chance to be in the spotlight. \\"The High King\\" is an exhilarating read, as by this stage most readers will be deeply invested in these characters and the land of Prydain, and the author swings us continually back and forth from despair to hope and back again. The fortunes of the good guys are always up for grabs, and Alexander makes sure we know that the stakes are high and the cost of defeat is unthinkable.<br /><br />As well as Alexander's wonderful sense of humour that is found throughout the series, there are (many) moments of great wisdom, poignancy and bitter-sweetness, not to mention romance, magic and mild horror. There are sacrifices, deaths of major characters, destruction of beautiful things and many a difficult decision to be made. Some of the issues are incredibly deep, and not at all what you'd expect to find in a children's book.<br /><br />Every story is wrapped up satisfactorily, from Magg's escape in \\"The Castle of Llyr\\" to Taran's role to play in `The Book of Three' to the gwythaint fledgling that was saved in the first book. Very few endings to series leave you with a sense of completion, but I believe \\"The High King\\" is one of them, as well as having my highest recommendation in terms of a truly worthwhile and rewarding read - a perfect five stars.nd they all have important and meaningful parts to play. <br /> <br />Previously, the books have been told solely from Taran's point of view, but now for the first time we see events through the eyes of other characters - everyone from Elionwy to Dallben to Kaw gets a chance to be in the spotlight. \\"The High King\\" is an exhilarating read, as by this stage most readers will be deeply invested in these characters and the land of Prydain, and the author swings us continually back and forth from despair to hope and back again.

When discussing these books with other people, you'll usually get a blank look if you say \\"the Prydain books\\" or \\"The Book of Three\\", but if you mention \\"The Black Cauldron\\", you'll probably get a vague sense of recognition. It is a Newbery Honour book and was made into a Disney film, and as such is the most popular of all five books.<br /><br />A few seasons since the events in \\"The Book of Three\\" have passed, and the old enchanter Dallben has called together a secret council to make war against the Death-Lord Arawn. Travelling to the small cottage are many great lords and warriors, including Prince Gwydion, a son of the House of Don, the wise and gentle bard Adaon, the proud warrior Morgant, and the arrogant Ellidyr. Together Gwydion and Dallben have hatched a daring plan to snatch Arawn's greatest weapon from his grasp - the terrible Black Cauldron that creates his undead warriors: the unkillable, zombie-like Cauldron-born.<br /><br />All this is immensely exciting news for Taran, who still has lofty dreams of heroism and danger, and for the Princess/scullery maid Eilonwy and the odd creature Gurgi (who can best be described as a hairier, benevolent Gollum). Taran is delighted to find that he has a place in the mission, but less excited to find that it simply involves minding the horses. Travelling with Ellidyr and Adaon, who give him very different lessons about the meaning of honour and courage, Taran once more ends up on an unplanned-for adventure with his core group of friends: Elionwy, Gurgi and Fflewddur Fflam.<br /><br />What follows is another wonderful story, with all the mystery, suspense, adventure, and intrigue that builds on the previous book and sets us up for the next one. All of the main characters are beautifully endearing, from the feisty Eilonwy, the loyal Gurgi, the grumpy Doli and the travelling king/bard Fflewddur who snaps a harp string every time he stretches the truth. But this is perhaps the only book when the secondary characters are more fascinating - Ellidyr, Morgant, Adaon, Gwystyl, and the strange sisters - Orgoch, Olwen and Orddu. None of these characters are who they seem to be, and blur the straightforward line between good and evil.<br /><br />Alexander laces wonderful humour throughout his story, as well as subtle morals that are worthy of thought. The fact that Alexander has actually used the myths and legends of Wales means that there is a sense of resonance in the environment and history in the pages - especially in the tale of how Dallben gained his wisdom.<br /><br />All of these books are utterly essential to a child's book shelf, and to a fantasy fan of any age, so make sure you pick up the following books \\"The Castle of Llyr\\", \\"Taran Wanderer\\" and \\"The High King\\".

McKillip once more takes us into her intricate and ornate imagination with \\"In the Forests of Serre\\", which has the feeling of an old fairytale that McKillip has discovered in some old book and fleshed-out for us in her unique style of writing. Combining several components from various myths and legends, (predominantly the Firebird and a witch who bears more than a passing resemblance to the Russian Baba Yaga), \\"In the Forests of Serre\\" is a book that McKillip's fans will find to their liking.<br /><br />In the Forests of Serre are many creatures of enchantment, both beautiful and deadly, predominantly the Mother of All Witches: Brume, who lives in a moving house of bones. It is one of her white chickens that Prince Ronan of Serre kills on his way home from the wars and so is cursed. For Ronan however, the threat of bad fortune is meaningless - he's already lost his wife and infant son to death: what could possibly be worse?<br /><br />As it turns out, an arranged marriage. In his absence, his tyrannical father has organised a marriage to Princess Sidonie of Dacia, attracted to the small kingdom's promise of magic and power. Though Sidonie is a reluctant bride, she realises the threat posed toward her home - if King Ferus cannot have Dacia through marriage, he will take it by force. The court wizard Unciel is sympathetic to her plight, and has arranged his young acquaintance Gyre to accompany the princess to her new home in Serre. But Gyre has his own agenda concerning the magic in Serre, and the hidden past between himself and Unciel has not yet reached its conclusion...<br /><br />And then Ronan is captivated by the sight of the Firebird, which reveals to him its secret, beautiful face. Without a second thought, Ronan escapes into the forests, which is only the first of many comings and goings into the Forests of Serre, which are traversed by almost all of our characters throughout the course of the novel. Each time something new is discovered, something is lost, something precious switches hands or is left behind. By the time the story ends each of the characters (even the far away Unciel and his new scribe Euan Ash, who is working to piece together his history) have all their secrets revealed.<br /><br />The characters are not especially vivid, especially when compared to others that appear in McKillip's previous books, but their dilemmas and mysteries are interesting - from Ronan's earth-shattering grief, to Sidonie's entrapment between two countries, to Gyre and Unciel's shadowed past together.<br /><br />The forest itself is gorgeously written in McKillip's distinctive use of language and imagery, and Kinuko Y. Craft's beautiful cover illustration once more embodies the atmosphere of the book. Filled with meaning and symbolism, this is a treat for any fantasy lover, especially those that are already fans of McKillip's work. Although at times it can be a bit needlessly complicated (I kept loosing track of who was in the forest and why, since there are so many coming and goings), and perhaps not the best McKillip novel out there, it was still an intriguing and fascinating read.omething is lost, something precious switches hands or is left behind.

Although many would avidly insist that you must read such books in publishing rather than chronological order (just look at the debate that rages over how you're supposed to read the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\") I would suggest reading this before \\"Charmed Life.\\" It will not ruin any of the surprises in that book, and instead drops little hints throughout (such as Chrestomanci's aversion to silver, and the name of his future wife) that will become that much more enjoyable when you read of them in \\"Charmed Life\\".<br /><br />Set in a parallel world where magic is an everyday occurrence young Christopher Chant lives a rather dull life, caught between his neglectful and feuding parents. Thank goodness for his dreams, which allow him to wander about in secret worlds - and are so vivid he often brings back objects with him into waking life! But after he meets his Uncle Ralph things begin to get more interesting. Organising his young nephew to meet a man named Tacroy in his dreams, Ralph instructs Christopher on removing other, larger things from his dreams into the real world. Seeing it as a fun game, as well as liking both his uncle and Tacroy very much, Christopher plays along.<br /><br />Between these exertions and visits to the young girl known as the Living Goddess, Christopher finds that life is not entirely what he wants it to be. With a longing only to become a professional cricketer, Christopher is horrified to find that he is destined to be the next Chrestomanci - the nine-lived enchanter in charge of governing magic in the worlds. Taken to Chrestomanci Castle, he is sulky and unco-operative - until the magic smuggler known as the Wraith grows in power, and the Goddess herself escapes into his world. Now Christopher is forced to take action...<br /><br />A fascinating, intricate, quirky book that takes place over several years and draws on several genres (only Diana Wynne Jones can go from English boarding school to Arabian Nights to elfish and Biblical lore), this could possibly be my favourite in the Chrestomanci quartet. Once again, the author proves she is an expert at human behaviour, a fan of cats and someone who's not afraid to tackle large and important issues in children's books.<br /><br />She's also wonderful at portraying the lack of self-awareness in people: one of the most memorable scenes is when Christopher makes an off-handed comment and is suddenly reprimanded by his teacher for years of selfishness and snobbery. Christopher is stunned, having no idea that he was so disliked - but on closer reflection he realises it's true. \\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\" deeply explores these ideas - that we can't always follow the dreams that we want, that we must sometimes put others before ourselves, and we have a responsibility to use our natural gifts.<br /><br />The characters are wonderful as usual - from Christopher himself who you watch grow as the novel progresses, to the spunky Goddess, to the terrifying cat Throgmorton and the amiable, elusive Uncle Ralph. Things are never quite what they appear in these novels, and it is as fun to explore the \\"Anywheres\\" along with Christopher. \\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\" is a great read, and a wonderful place to begin the journeys into the rest of the Chrestomanci books.and draws on several genres (only Diana Wynne Jones can go from English boarding school to Arabian Nights to elfish and Biblical lore), this could possibly be my favourite in the Chrestomanci quartet.

Out of all of Diana Wynne Jones's novels, \\"Charmed Life\\" is possibly her most famous, and her most read. It is the first published of her Chrestomanci novels, and it stars many of her most famous characters with her requisite twisting plot and quirky sense of humour. Set in a parallel world ripe with magic, wizards and magical creatures, DWJ's \\"Chrestomanci\\" quartet were clearly inspirational to J. K. Rowling in her creation of Hogwarts and her wizarding world - a lot of comparisons can be made between the two. Ultimately \\"Harry Potter\\" is the deeper and more intricate series, but DWJ's novels are stand-alone, can be read out of order, and are rich in detail and cleverness.<br /><br />Gwendolyn Chant is an extraordinarily gifted witch, despite the fact that her little brother Cat has no magical ability at all. After their parents' deaths, the two orphans are taken in by Mrs Sharp amongst a neighbourhood of magical folk - but Gwendolyn has bigger plans for herself that concern nothing less than the conquering of the world. When the two of them are taken to Chrestomanci Castle, Gwendolyn is delighted - Chrestomanci is a powerful enchanter that she feels sure will teach and guide her on her way to world domination.<br /><br />But things are not quite as she expected - Chrestomanci has no desire whatsoever to make this young witch even more powerful before she gains a little self-control. With the added restrictions of their tutor Mr Saunders and Chrestomanci's family watching her every move, Gwendolyn has had quite enough - she begins to wage war on Chrestomanci.<br /><br />From there things only begin to get uglier, as Chrestomanci gets more and more stubborn and Gwendolyn becomes more and more frustrated. Stuck in the middle is Cat, desperately loyal to his sister but just as eager to fit in with his new family. Gwendolyn's plans are even deeper than expected, with secret trips to dodgy black marketeers and a hidden source of magic that even Cat is unaware of...<br /><br />Funny, heartfelt, realistic, imaginative and sometimes even a little grotesque, \\"Charmed Life\\" is one of a work of true children's literature. The characters are vivid, the storyline intriguing, and the morals sincere without being too heavy-handed. Some components are a little complicated: DWJ sprinkles hints and clues throughout the book and some of these are hard to remember - but all of that simply justifies a second reading to pick up the things you missed!<br /><br />Chrestomanci himself is a gem - think for a moment of all the famous wizards in literature. You're almost certainly thinking: Merlin, Gandalf, Dumbledore (and if you're rather well-read, Dallben, Merriman Lyon and Cadellin) What do all these wizards have in common? - they're old, wizened, sage-like and immensely wise. Chrestomanci turns this tired stereotype around on its head - he's handsome, well-dressed, reasonably young and quite infuriating at times! Plus, if you've already read \\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\", the name of Chrestomanci's wife may make you smile...<br /><br />In typical DWJ fashion, the story does not end on a perfectly upbeat note - in fact it's rather sad, with only a trembling sort of hopefulness in our main character that will induce readers to seek out other Chrestomanci books: \\"Witch Week\\", \\"The Magicians of Caprona\\", \\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\" and \\"Mixed Magics\\" - an anthology of short stories.. <br /> <br />Funny, heartfelt, realistic, imaginative and sometimes even a little grotesque, \\"Charmed Life\\" is one of a work of true children's literature.

US	39424751	RV4RN2NKIWYWN	006447352X	512932093	Fire and Hemlock	Books	4	38	39	N	N	"But Aye She Grips and Holds Him Fast..."	\\"Fire and Hemlock\\" is possibly Diana Wynne Jones's most complex and subtle novel, and it's certainly not for the younger readers who've enjoyed her most famous work, the \\"Chrestomanci\\" novels. It is most basically described as a retelling of the Tam Lin/Thomas the Rhymer ballads, set in 1980's England over a nine-year period. Needless to say, it is dense and complicated, filled with hidden meaning, metaphor and symbolism where two threads of life are wound together to make an intricate whole.<br /><br />Told predominantly in flashback sequences, we begin when nineteen-year-old Polly Whittacker is packing to go to college when her memory begins to stir. Her recollections of a book and a picture on the wall are not as she remembers them, and only when she concentrates and really begins to think does she realise that she seems to have two sets of memories - one of a mundane school life, and one that is filled with the mysterious and supernatural: all centred around a man named Tom Lynn.<br /><br />She begins to re-follow this thread of her life, beginning with her meeting with Tom Lynn when she accidentally joins a funeral at the grand Hunsdon House held by the strange Leroy family. Pursuing the strange friendship, Polly and Tom make up stories where they exist as superheroes named Tom Piper and Hero and meet many times to discuss this sense of reality they dub `Nowhere'. But something strange begins to happen - these stories of theirs have a way of becoming true, and it all seems to have something to do with Tom's sinister ex-wife Laurel and her designs for Tom and Polly.<br /><br />Throughout this however, Polly also must deal with the somewhat crazy exploits of her school-friend Nina and the selfish actions of her divorcee parents: the negligence of her father and the utter self-delusion of her mother who blames everybody but herself for her problems. Also is the attentions of two young boys - the sulky Sebastian and the roughish Leslie, both of which have links to the Leroy family and their grim family heritage.<br /><br />To get the most out of \\"Fire and Hemlock\\" you must be a patient and careful reader - I'd even go so far as to say it's necessary to read the book twice to fully understand it. There are so many details and plot threads that it's difficult to keep track of them all, especially when you consider all the action is melded with a different set of memories that Polly must sort out in her mind as the book goes on (not counting the range of stories that she and Tom make up!).<br /><br />The characters are as usual wonderfully and vividly created and interact realistically with each other.  Polly's grandmother in particular is a woman worth knowing, but the flamboyant Nina, the sullen Sebastian and the sad, haunted Tom are also beautifully presented. However, the one character I couldn't really warm up to was Polly herself - for reasons more instinctive than reasonable, I just couldn't really like her that much, and I'm afraid I'm not really sure why.<br /><br />\\"Fire and Hemlock\\" is also the author's most descriptive book - usually she doesn't bother to much with details, but in this case she takes the time to carefully lay the setting, resulting in an evocative and interesting atmosphere whether it be the spookiness of Hunsdon House or the sterile cleanness of Polly's father's apartment.<br /><br />The main problem with this book is that it is incredibly complicated: even after three reads I'm still a little baffled as to how and why certain things happened - the last chapter in particular is very ambiguous and unsatisfactory in its wrap up concerning Polly and her relationships with the other characters. Although she does explain certain mysteries, they are usual explained in just a few sentences which are easy to miss or not understand properly. This is rather frustrating since it's a beautiful novel which deserves to be savoured and understood - yet it's extremely difficult to do just this thanks to the lack ofcohesiveness.<br /><br />As a sidenote, this novel along with \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" are Diana Wynne Jones's favourite works - with that in mind it pays to read it carefully. All in all, it is one of DWJ's most challenging books, but ultimately one of the most intelligent, intriguing and rewarding.to the lack of cohesiveness. <br /> <br />As a sidenote, this novel along with \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" are Diana Wynne Jones's favourite works - with that in mind it pays to read it carefully.

Combining the atmosphere of Celtic folklore with a plot reminiscent of Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\", as well as an intricate plot (including a huge twist halfway through that will completely turn your perception of the story on its head) and likeable characters, \\"Power of Three\\" is one of Diana Wynne Jones's best novels - and so inevitably it is one of her least known.<br /><br />Set on moorlands inhabited by Giants, reptilian Dorig and tribes of warrior-like clans, the first two chapters introduces the rest of the story to come. First, Adara and her bullish brother Orban come across a young Dorig princeling, and Orban demands the beautiful collar around its neck. Refusing, the Dorig places a deep curse upon the collar that will bestow bad luck upon the holder and the surroundings.<br /><br />Chapter two takes place several years later when Adara elopes with the chief of a neighbouring Mound. This reads like a Celtic legend as the hero Gest must perform three impossible tasks concerning riddles, collars, standing stones, Dorig and Giants, and exactly how he manages to accomplish these feats is a mystery that (like the influence of the curse) is explored more deeply in the rest of the book that skips onto the next generation.<br /><br />Gest and Adara's three children are Ayna, Gair and Ceri. Ayna the eldest can answer any question posed toward her, whilst Ceri can not only find anything that is lost but manipulate matter with his mind. Gair however is devastatingly normal, and so considers himself a disappointment to his entire community. But with the evil of the curse winding its way into all aspects of life (including food supply, war with the Dorig, and an unwelcome invasion of relatives into their Mound), Gair finally reaches breaking point and heads for the countryside. Tailed by Ayna and Ceri, the three siblings find adventures with both Dorig and Giants waiting for them, and realisation that the Moor itself is in danger of destruction.<br /><br />In terms of theme and plot, \\"Power of Three\\" may very well be the deepest and most complicated novel for young readers that DWJ has written. Exploring the definition of humanity, the worth of the individual and the necessity for peace at its core, the book also has plenty of humour, quirky characters and intricate subplots - far too many to properly explain in a simple review. But it is worth saying that this book in particular has a range of interesting and vivid characters - from saintly Adara, woebegone Gerald, bossy Brenda, spoilt Ceri, sage-like Ayna and the odious Ondo. But the spotlight mostly falls on Gair, and he is a protagonist that most will find very easy to relate to - melancholy and serious, but determined and intelligent, and altogether a likeable guy.<br /><br />The author also makes some wonderful connections between characters - the siblings in particular are warm and affectionate (most of the time) and the friendships that Gair forges within the story are also realistic and enjoyable to read. But then again, DWJ is an expert at portraying human behaviour and it should come as no surprise to any familiar readers that such things are handled just as well here.<br /><br />\\"Power of Three\\" definitely has my recommendation, though I should warn you about reading other reviews on the story, as some of them give away the big twist - something that shouldn't be revealed if you want to truly revel in DWJ's genius.of theme and plot, \\"Power of Three\\" may very well be the deepest and most complicated novel for young readers that DWJ has written.

Diana Wynne Jones once again combines eccentric characters, moral ambiguity, magic, time travelling, shapeshifting and an uncanny ability to portray human behaviour in one of her best books: \\"Aunt Maria\\". With all the twists and turns that we expect from Wynne Jones, \\"Aunt Maria\\" is one of the most re-readable and enjoyable books in her vast collection.<br /><br />After the accidental death of their father, Naomi \\"Mig\\" and Chris Laker are reluctantly taken to Cranbury-on-Sea by their mother to visit Aunt Maria. Maria appears to be a cuddly old lady (though is constantly ringing up and meddling in their lives), but once they get to their house the siblings find that she is much worse. Behind her compliments and manners is an old lady determined to get her own way - for instance, when she says \\"I won't bother with breakfast, now Lavinia's not here to bring it to me in bed,\\" she means: \\"I demand breakfast in bed.\\"<br /><br />Cranbury itself is just as bad: the women flock around Maria in daily tea-parties like she's their Queen-bee, whilst the men work like zombies and the clone-like children spend their days in an orphanage. Enigmas pile up on all sides: who is the ghost haunting Chris's room? What happened to the previous maid Lavinia? Why does Maria despise the elderly Phelp neighbours? What is contained within the beautiful green box Mig finds? And could it be possible that the children's father actually reached Cranbury on the day he supposedly died?<br /><br />All the answers to these mysteries are brought together beautifully as the book progresses - but not before Mig must deal with the battle of the sexes in the town, the fact that her brother has been turned into a wolf, the mind-manipulation being dealt upon her mother, and Maria's own sinister designs for her! For such a slim volume it is jam-packed full of interesting ideas, plot revelations and clever ideas.<br /><br />Diana Wynne Jones usually prefers males as her protagonists, but after reading Mig I hope that in the future she creates more female ones, as she's one of the funniest, sympathetic, self-aware and utterly helpless heroines I've ever read - and despite her complete lack of doing hardly anything proactive or helpful throughout the book, she's an utter delight. Also on hand is her brother Chris who is far more outspoken than she, and doesn't hesitate to insult anyone he pleases. Throughout the story the bond between the siblings is strong, realistic and immensely touching - as when the transformed Chris seeks out comfort from his sister.<br /><br />Mrs Laker is also nicely created, as is the sinister Elaine, but of course the centrepiece of the story is Maria herself. Self-righteous, self-pitying, hypocritical, intensely annoying, and yet a pleasure to read about, this is one character that's impossible to describe: you'll have to read in order to really appreciate what Wynne Jones has created. The family's way of handling Maria is the author at her hilarious best, and the closest another author has come to capturing the sheer loathsomeness of Maria is J.K. Rowling (who by the way, has almost certainly read this book) and her own villainess Dolorous Umbridge.<br /><br />As well as this is the intricate and well-paced plot, which includes a huge number of characters, events, magical implements and ideas. The time-travel sequence in particular is marvellously created, and I'm certain it was the inspiration for Harry Potter's similar experience in \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban.\\" Most wonderful of all is her ability to take human relationships and explore them in depth - in this case it is the way some use guilt and the rules of manners in order to get their way.<br /><br />I would say that \\"Aunt Maria\\" is my favourite Diana Wynne Jones book out there, but so many great titles are out there that I wouldn't want to limit myself to just one. In any case \\"Aunt Maria\\" an immensely enjoyable book - and if there are any film-makers out there, it would also make a brilliant movie: hint, hint.also make a brilliant movie: hint, hint. <br />	2004-12-11

It is continually frustrating to read a rich, suspenseful, beautifully crafted book and then find that hardly anybody else knows about it - such is apparently the case with Tanith Lee's \\"The Castle of Dark.\\" Containing an imprisoned damsel, a spooky castle, a magical harp and a mysterious secret, this is a wonderful book that has the same tone and atmosphere of an old dark fairytale.<br /><br />The chapters switch back and forth between two characters: Lilune is a strange young woman living with two hags in an abandoned and dark castle. With hair down to the ground and without any need to consume food, Lilune is intensely lonely and curious about the outside world. Lir is a young harper, chosen for his calling in his youth by an unnamed traveller who instructs him on the crafting of a beautiful harp that makes the most beautiful music.<br /><br />When Lir is called to the Dark Castle by Lilune's magic he finds himself caught up in webs of secrecy by the nearby villages, the two hags and Lilune herself. Why is this young maiden kept chained to her bed? Why is she allergic to the sun's light? And what dark influence has followed the two of them as they escape from the Castle into the world?<br /><br />It's very difficult to write any more without destroying the intrigue and mystery captured within this book. With a style that is quite Tolkien-esque, in a world that is beautifully brought to life by Lee's poetic language, \\"The Castle of Dark\\" is a short but memorable read. Without bogging us down with boring facts and encyclopedic knowledge about this fantasy world (like other fantasy authors feels compelled to do) Lee creates a dark fairytale setting simply, vividly and realistically: moist and green forests where grey lions stalk between the trees, the splendour and pomp of a city's royal court, and of course the creepy and mysterious Castle itself. Just being able to explore these places is reason enough to read this book.<br /><br />There is another thread of intrigue in the form of Lir's \\"mentor\\", whom he dubs 'Wild-Eyes', an elusive figure that claims to have harped in Hell itself (the devil apparently is quite a gentleman) and reveals some quite profound truths about the nature of music.<br /><br />Lir and Lilune make great protagonists, both with their flaws, but both likeable and sympathetic, whilst simultaneously remaining a fey-like quality about them that makes us certain that we'd never meet anyone like them in our own world. Refreshingly, Lee does not force a romance between them, and in fact their relationship plays out more like a brother/sister bond. As the only two characters in the story that are given names, their two separate paths are intricately plotted together - and Lilune's plight may just move you to tears.<br /><br />A simple, but beautiful and poignant book \\"The Castle of Dark\\" is one of the few fantasy books out there that reads as totally original, yet with resonance to real myths and legends of the world.

Tanith Lee once again proves herself a master of Young Adult fantasy with this wonderful (but apparently little known) story of the battle of the sexes. Set in a gloriously created world where women ride horned lions and rule over mankind, \\"East of Midnight\\" is a book that is easy to read, yet raises a range of questions on the differences between man and woman and the way in which we interact with each other.<br /><br />At the beginning of the story, Lee herself writes where the inspiration for it came from: \\"Old legends have it, before men were kings, women ruled large areas of the world. They were as powerful and ruthless as any of the man-ruled states which came after. Indeed, the harshness of men towards women in many early societies was, they said, due to the cruelty the female societies - matriarchies - had already displayed toward men.<br /><br />\\"And so what happens if a young man from a male-dominanted world gets thrown into a world of matriarchy? Fascinated by this thought, I set out to explore the whole thing in this novel.\\"<br /><br />Dekteon is a young runaway slave who is miraculously saved from his former master when he's transported into another world by the magician Zaister. But things are not quite as simple as that. Zaister is the husband and consort of King Izvire - the stunning woman who rules over a matriarchal city. Every five years she takes a new husband - because the former one must be sacrificed in order to ensure the natural balance of the world.<br /><br />Zaister has long plotted his escape, and his rescue of Dekteon (who is his double in another world) was merely so the two could switch places. Now whilst Zaister finds that freedom in Dekteon's world is not all it's cracked up to be, Dekteon finds himself amongst the beauty of Zaister's world with only a month left to live before he's sacrificed.<br /><br />But Dekteon does not have the same fear of women ingrained in him that the rest of the men of this world do, and begins a campaign against them that no once else would dare. Up against Izvire, his mother-in-law Kyrast and his daughter Vesain, Dekteon attempts to escape his death-sentence and stop the needless deaths of the king's consorts.<br /><br />The story races along on every page, being continually colourful, fascinating, exciting and nerve-wracking as the countdown to Dekteon's death creeps closer. Lee not only vividly describes the matriarchal world where women are dominant and men subservient, but takes a deeper look at what makes these opposing genders tick. Far from taking the women's side, Lee portrays them as hard, merciless and sexist rulers, who nevertheless feel true remorse and loneliness when their husbands are killed. There are no true good-guys or bad-guys here.<br /><br />The men Dekteon and Zaister are our main protagonists, and have very different views on women and how they are to be treated by them. Though by the end of the story Zaister gets away with far more than he rightfully deserves, together their attitudes form an insightful way of looking at the world and the roles of men and women.<br /><br />\\"East of Midnight\\" is a rich, exciting, poignant read that deserves more recognition than it appears to have.

On returning to the House Claidi and her new husband find that the slaves do not need their help - on the night of Claidi's escape, the slaves overthrew their former masters and now live in relative peace and harmony.

But the Old Lady Jizania Tiger, who instigated the whole thing seems to have something more up her sleeve: calling Claidi, Argul and another slave Dengwei (who led the revolt) to her, she reveals that the famous Ironel - matriarch of the Wolf Tower - has summoned them to her home, promising to reveal more information concerning the enigmas surrounding them.<br /><br />Once there, readers are treated to a reunion, as major characters from all the previous books turn up: Nemian, Winter Raven, Venn and Ngarbo arrive in order to hear Ironel's news. And the news she reveals is shocking: Venn and Argul's mother, the famous sorceress Ustareth that has meddled in these characters lives from beyond the grave with her plans and charms...is in fact alive. Astonished by such a fact, these characters (with the exception of Nemian) decide to travel in Yinyay (the moving tower) to her land in order to confront her...<br /><br />For the final book in the series, it's a satisfactory conclusion - giving us wrap-ups to all the main characters, and finally letting us meet the figure that's been behind all their confusion and grief. Tanith Lee continues to create vivid, interesting and beautiful settings as well as intrigue in the form of the (quite spooky) moving statues and the way in which all six characters separately approach Ustareth's citadel. The diary entries are once more realistic, thoughtful and poignant and you can tell Claidi herself has grown as a character when compared to her writing in \\"Wolf Tower\\" - the changes were never obvious, but are definitely there.<br /><br />Throughout the entire series I was often frustrated with the lack of coherence and grandeur in the plots concerning Claidi and those around her: rather than any dark and deep meaning to them, the `bad-guys' do what they do out of pettiness, personal gain and family issues. My grievances that these plots weren't clearly drawn out or explained remain, but my feelings on the fact that the reasons behind the ongoing `mystery' were somewhat shallow have changed. Tanith Lee is a wonderful author, and I have to admire the originality in creating a fantasy series that wasn't about good or evil, world domination, tragic romances or myriads of fantasy races. This was simply about a young girl who was caught up in the selfish designs of others. Once you understand this, I think you'll be able to appreciate these books better.<br /><br />Which is not to say these four books are completely without their flaws - they can get quite confusing at times and it's tricky keeping track of all the clues and mysteries that Lee gives us, and some of the revelations (concerning Ustareth's decisions and Claidi's powers) at the end didn't seem to make much sense. I also dislike the way they are divided into separate volumes - it makes it immensely difficult to track down all the books in order to get the complete story (and rest assured, you cannot read them out of order). The Claidi quartet does not have my highest recommendation - if you have too much trouble understanding or even finding these books, then don't get too worked up.

Probably Never Will..."	\\"The Wolf Star\\" (also published as \\"Wolf Star Rising\\") is the second of four books known as the Claidi journals, stories told in the format of a diary by the young escaped-slave Claidi and her travels throughout a fantasy world in search of her origins and a home of her own. In the first installment \\"The Wolf Tower\\", which you really must read if you want to understand what's going on in this story, Claidi escaped the confines of the House with the handsome Nemian, only to find that his intentions for her were less than honourable. Taking her to his dismal city and the matriarch Ironel, Claidi found that the inexorable Law of the Wolf Tower made her the new distributor of the cruel and unnecessary rules that governed the land.<br /><br />Destroying the mechanisms that put the Law in place, Claidi made her escape with the handsome bandit-leader Argul - her betrothed. At the beginning of this new part of her diary, Claidi is immensely excited about her approaching wedding to the man she loves, and her acceptance into the extended family of the Hulta. But as she prepares on the wedding day, a catastrophe occurs - she is kidnapped by men of the Wolf Tower in a great balloon, and taken across the sea to a strange place known as the Rise. With only clockwork figurines for company, Claidi desperately searches for a way to escape the confusing and dangerous moving rooms of the Rise, a huge palace and garden carved into the side of a great cliff.<br /><br />Soon she discovers that she's not alone - the Rise is the home of the elusive and confusing Prince Venarion (or Venn for short), who is just as bewildered at Claidi's presence in his home as she is. Abandoned by his mother Ustareth at a young age, Claidi suspects that somehow she is connected to the events that are now unfolding: the hidden designs of the House and the someone who has plans for them both without either of them knowing, someone who mysteriously signs their letters as \\"we\\", and who has a secret agenda going on. Wanting only to uncover the mystery of the higher interest in her, and to return to her beloved Argul, Claidi talks Venn into undertaking a trek deep into the Rise to find the library - the one place where they might both find the answers they're looking for.<br /><br />Unfortunately in continuing the story, Tanith Lee raises more questions than answers, and many of her ideas come across as confused and contradicting. She possibly has a master-plan in mind for the completion of the story and the unfolding of the mystery, but she is unravelling it in a very muddled way - it's almost as if she's making it up as she goes along and later figuring out how all the clues fit together, rather than the other way around. Despite this however, the characters, the story and the mystery of Claidi's role in the world is interesting enough to keep one reading.<br /><br />There are also complaints concerning the setting of the book - \\"The Wolf Tower\\" was a journey that took place over a large area, whilst here Claidi is stuck almost entirely within a single house. Granted, it is an exceptionally fascinating house, with moving rooms and clockwork servants, but much of the appeal of the first book was the scale and freedom of Claidi's travels. Here, that is gone.<br /><br />But \\"The Wolf Star\\" is a good follow-up to the previous book, and most will be interested enough in picking up the next one \\"Wolf Queen,\\" even though I am always frustrated at writers/publishers that split books into more than one volume needlessly. Claidi's journal is one big story - it should be presented as one large volume, not lots of little ones. There are overviews of the previous book at the start of each new installment, but I'd recommend reading them in order.oing on.

Her story begins in the House where she works as a slave to the spoilt Lady Jade Leaf, which Claidi recounts in the book that she's stolen from her mistress's stationary chest. She's not entirely sure what made her do such a dangerous thing, especially since there's nothing particularly interesting to write about her life - she slaves after Jade Leaf night and day, living in fear of beating and punishments and attending the endless rituals of the rigid House.<br /><br />But then something does happen: a hot air balloon is shot down over the Garden, and the House guards drag back an extraordinary young man named Nemian. Claidi is at once transfixed by him, and when she is summoned to the presence of the Great Lady Jizania Tiger, she's astonished and delighted to find that she's being offered a chance at escape with the handsome Nemian. All she has to do is take Jizania's key, unlock the prison door, and Nemian will take her to his own City - to freedom.<br /><br />And so Claidi's journey begins across the land known as the Waste, and all the many strange tribes, villages and people she meets throughout - some dangerous, some friendly, but all fascinating and worthy of recording in her beloved book. Finally Nemian's City looms, and his secret agenda is revealed - it seems Claidi's fate is inexplicitly linked to something known as the Wolf Tower, and the terrible Laws that are governed from its heights. But by this stage, Claidi is prepared to take matters into her own hands...<br /><br />Young readers will love exploring the range of interesting landscapes and worlds that Tanith Lee vividly describes, everything from rainforests to deserts to huge cities are wonderfully brought to life through her descriptive prose - predominantly of note is the band of nomadic bandits, including their charismatic leader Argul. It's as close as you can possibly get to really experiencing these places without actually being there yourself, whilst at the same time uncovering Claudi's hidden past and the conspiracy that follows her journey to the forbidding Wolf Tower. Freedom is the theme of the story, whether it's freedom from tradition and rules, or the restrictions one imposes upon oneself, as Claidi not only goes from captivity to freedom, but from reliance on other people to independent thought.<br /><br />Claidi herself makes a rather insipid heroine at first - quite a few of her decisions are obviously foolish and her behaviour at times is rather confusing (plus her love story with Argul is rather too sudden and unconvincing), but the complete honesty and wit that she uses in writing down her experiences more than compensate for this.<br /><br />In fact, what makes \\"The Wolf Tower\\" so readable, is the way in which the story is told. Rather than third-person, or even strictly first-person, Tanith Lee makes the book itself Claudi's journal - and Claidi herself is talking directly to the reader. Obviously Claidi has no idea who it is that is reading her words, but she ponders on this mystery, wondering how far her book has travelled, how far into the future it's being read, and what the reader thinks of her. In terms of Claudi's direct addresses to an unseen reader, this is the most personal and interactive book I've ever read. The connection between the real-life reader (whoever it might be) and the fictional Claidi is remarkable, and something that is not read, but experienced. Tanith Lee creates the bond ingeniously, and young readers between ten and thirteen (male or female) are bound to be captivated by this intimacy.<br /><br />It's just a shame that the publishers didn't go a bit further in their presentation of the book, perhaps using a handwritten font, or making the book appear as an actual journal. But never mind - \\"The Wolf Tower\\" and the following books in the series are must-reads for any fantasy fans, especially those inclined to Tanith Lee's wonderful stories..

Set in a prehistoric fantasy setting of ice and snow, \\"The Woman Who Loved Reindeer\\" refers to its two main characters: the young Caribou and the child she names Reindeer. As someone who experiences prophetic dreams, Caribou lives alone until her sister-in-law brings to her a golden-haired child. Claiming that it is not her husband Visjna's child (Caribou's brother), Branja begs her to take in the child - before Visjna returns from the season-long hunt and so that the child's true father cannot come to claim him.<br /><br />Caribou is initially disdainful of such a request, but the tiny infant soon warms her heart. Due to his love of the reindeer herds, she names him after them, and goes about raising him to the best of his ability. But soon it becomes clear that he is no ordinary child. After a terrifying run-in with a golden reindeer that results in her brother's death, Caribou begins to notice more and more abnormalities about him: he neither cries nor laughs, bleeds golden blood, has inhuman reflections, and cannot understand the concept of love. But Caribou loves him deeply, and when she begins to suspect he is one of the spirit \\"daimons\\" she is terrified that she will loose him forever. When the seasons change, he takes reindeer form in order to travel with the herds beyond the dangerous Burning Plains and the Lands of the Broken Snow.<br /><br />But Caribou's lands are in jeopardy with a range of natural disasters that threaten the people. Having never been particularly close to them, Caribou is prepared to depart with Reindeer to safer lands - but years of service as a wisewoman makes her sympathetic to those that come to her for help. She convinces Reindeer to lead all those who want to on the perilous journey to safety, and with her guiding dreams she leads her people onwards. But throughout the trek is her ongoing pain: on whether or not Reindeer can come to love her, and whether she can trust him to fulfil his promise.<br /><br />\\"The Woman Who Loved Reindeer\\" is another wonderful story from Meredith Ann Pierce, whose beautiful language, meaningful stories and rich themes make for essential reading. Her landscapes are wonderfully invoked, with everything from the languages to the details of clothing and utensils described make the entire setting a rich and realistic setting. Her use of real folklore (most of which is Scandinavian and Nordic) helps to create a sense of resonance and the feeling that this is a `real' part of the world's mythology in her use of daimons, trollwomen, sea-maids and Firekings.<br /><br />Which is interesting since in terms of plot, it has several Biblical echoes - in particular Noah's Ark and the story of Moses. Caribou's people are driven from their homes by natural disasters (like the flood) and forced on a long journey to safety and freedom, which at one stage involves a land-bridge being risen above the waters (like the parting of the Red Sea). Caribou throughout is a wise and determined leader - disciplining those that deserve it, encouraging the unfaithful, and seeing through her promise no matter what the costs.<br /><br />Some things don't quite gel together: the move from a mother/son relationship to lovers between Reindeer and Caribou is never quite drawn out or explored properly (surprising considering the changing feelings of love is the main theme - in fact the very title - of the book) and a second love interest is introduced only to be pushed to the side. And we never really learn anything conclusive about Branja's fate. But for any fans of fantasy, storytelling, or Meredith Ann Pierce, this is a must-read.ed Reindeer\\" is another wonderful story from Meredith Ann Pierce, whose beautiful language, meaningful stories and rich themes make for essential reading.

A Race Against the Rising..."	\\"Silver on the Tree\\" is the fifth and final book in \\"The Dark is Rising\\" series, and if you have never picked up the previous installments, then don't start here - you won't have a clue what's going on. If however, you have read \\"Over Sea, Under Stone,\\" \\"The Dark is Rising,\\" \\"Greenwitch\\" and \\"The Grey King,\\" then here is the big finale you've been waiting for. Finally, all our main characters are reunited for the first and last time - Merriman Lyon, Will Stanton, Bran Davis, the Drew children, the Rowlands and the rest of the Old Ones who have come together for the final battle against the malevolent powers of the Dark.<br /><br />They have gathered in Wales, following the last lines of the Light's prophecy; \\"when the Dark comes rising, six shall turn it back\\", in order to find the last talisman of the Light. Whilst Will (the youngest of the Old Ones: guardians of humanity) and Bran (the son of King Arthur who was transported forward in time by his mother) travel across the Lost Land in search of the crystal sword, Merriman and Simon, Jane and Barney Drew face their own challenges when the powers of the Dark catapult them into different time periods. Soon it is a race to the finish line and the Midsummer Tree, but with a traitor in their midst and the forces of the Dark towering around them, it's hardly going to be easy to finally defeat the Dark.<br /><br />Cooper again introduces several historical and legendary figures from England's past, including Owain Glyndwr, Herne the Hunter, Gwion/Talisan and of course King Arthur himself, and she invokes the landscapes and countrysides beautifully. By the end of the series, we are met with the inevitable sadness of farewells and life-changing decisions that place \\"The Dark is Rising\\" amongst the best of children's fantasy literature - this is not simply a hackneyed battle between opposing forces; it involves real betrayal, real heartbreak and real pain - where the climatic moment is not a sword-fight, but a decision that must be made by a human being that has just lost everything he's loved. Our characters have only half-won the battle: for as she points out in the beginning of the novel when a young Pakistani boy is targeted for bullying, the real enemy lies within humankind.<br /><br />There are a few things that I'm not quite sure on, but before I start pointing them out I have to say that Susan Cooper is an extremely sensitive and subtle writer - if you don't read carefully you can miss half of what she has to say. As I have only read \\"Silver on the Tree\\" twice, (once when I was quite young, and once when I was in a hurry), I'm quite certain that I fall into this category. Her themes are deep, her writing is articulate, and she doesn't make it easy for insensitive readers. If you want to get the most out of these books, then you have to work for it.<br /><br />In saying that, some things came across as rather puzzling. The sequence and timing of events are rather patchy, and often things happen that don't seem to make much sense (although keep in mind, I may be misinterpreting them - I'm sure Cooper knows more about writing than I do). The book is divided into four parts, and although the first provides a promising beginning, and the last an exciting conclusion, the two middle parts are problematic. The situation with the Drews, in which they are transported back into time seems a little unnecessary - they do not seem to learn or gain anything of value that justifies their presence there. Meanwhile, as Bran and Will traverse the Lost Land, they come up against several obstacles that are disposed of rather easily - such as the terrifying spectre of a moving horse skeleton: the boys are saved when the petals of a may tree falls upon it. Huh?<br /><br />Furthermore, the powers of the Dark just didn't seem that scary this time around. Previously, they were one of Cooper's strongest inventions, whether they appeared as amiable siblings, sullen, half-crazed painters, sweet-faced farm-girls, haggard tramps, a malevolent mountain-presence or the terrifying visage of a Black-cloaked Rider. But here, rather than appearing as a truly foreboding threat, the bad-guys do little but tail our heroes, mock them, and generally come across as annoying. Cooper drives home the point that the Dark can do the good guys no physical harm so many times that we loose all fear for their safety. I had no doubts that they'd make it through with no causalities - but the emotional scarring that they'd been exposed to is also negated when all but one of the main characters loose the memory of their adventures.<br /><br />As mentioned, Cooper's work is immensely subtle and there is too much to be discovered for me to give it all away. I'll just reveal just one: read the descriptions of the Old Ones in the ships carefully at the story's end - she does not give names but \\"a tall burly figure in a smith's apron, a small  man in a green coat and an imperious grey-haired lady, leaning on a stick,\\"  are all characters that we've seen before. So read carefully and  frequently if you want to get the most out of this particular book, as well of the rest of the installments in this award-winning, immensely rewarding series.aced farm-girls, haggard tramps, a malevolent mountain-presence or the terrifying visage of a Black-cloaked Rider.

Although it is not my personal favourite, \\"The Grey King,\\" the fourth book in \\"the Dark is Rising\\" sequence is generally considered the best in the series, and is the winner of the Newbery Medal. Following on from the other books, Will Stanton (an Old One of the Light, who protects humanity from the forces of the Dark) travels to Wales, in order to fetch the golden harp, which in turn will wake the mysterious Sleepers, fulfilling the next part of the prophesy chronicling the battle between Light and Dark.<br /><br />But the circumstances surrounding his visit are grim: after a serious illness he has been sent to relatives in order to convalesce, and soon finds that he cannot remember the vital phrases of the prophesy. Though he can only remember bits and pieces, he is aware that he is meant to seek help from \\"the raven boy\\" and \\"silver eyes that see the wind\\" - whatever that means. Amongst his cheery relatives things are well, but in the hidden farmlands he soon meets a young albino boy named Bran and his silver-eyed dog Cafall. Bran's mother disappeared when he was just a baby, leaving him in the care of Owen Davis, a devout and religious man who is kind, but strict with the lonely Bran. Though he is obviously unusual, only Will can see that there is something so much more to Bran than meets the eye.<br /><br />He also meets John Rowlands, an aged and immensely wise farmer who is one of the few human beings who could possibly understand Will's task, and Caradog Pritchard, a hideously bad-tempered man who is out to make things difficult for everyone around him. But beyond all of this is the malevolence of one of the greatest powers of the Dark: the Grey King and his vicious grey foxes who are out to prevent the Light from gaining their advantage with the golden harp.<br /><br />Merriman Lyon, the linking factor in all five books has only a minor role here, and the Drew children are not present at all - this is solely Will's quest that he must fulfil by himself, with Bran as the last major player in the series to be introduced. By its end we are all set to head into the final book \\"Silver on the Tree\\".<br /><br />It will help if you know basic Arthurian lore (in particular the love-triangle), since Cooper is subtle in her meanings, and never spells it out entirely. Bran's mother's situation will only resonant if you are fully aware of who she is revealed to be and what she once did.  And of course, it is necessary to have read the previous books in the series in order to grasp the full meaning of what's going on here.<br /><br />A criticism levelled toward these books at one stage, were that they were too black-and-white: there was a Light side and a Dark side, the goodies and the baddies and that was all there was to it. But here for the first time, Cooper adds little touches of grey to the matter, or at least makes you look at the opposites in a different way. It is Rowlands that points out that the Light can be just as merciless and unforgiving as the Dark, that \\"at the centre of the Light is a cold, white flame, just as at the centre of the Dark there is a great black pit.\\" The Light can often be merciless and cruel, manipulating things to reach its own ends - and Rowlands claims he would choose one human life over their cold principles. As well as this there is a sense of powers beyond good and evil, a \\"High Magic\\" that governs over both of them and refuses to take sides.<br /><br />As well as this the book deals with darker and more human issues than previously, such as violence, adultery, piety, betrayal, loss, temper, attempted rape (though portrayed *extremely* carefully), and the capacity for humanity to destroy itself. Cooper's language is beautiful, her research thorough, her themes profound and her meanings deep and thoughtful. There is so much hidden depth (sometimes held within a single sentence that is easy to miss) that it's impossible to list them all, but here's one - Will assumes that it was the Dark's powers that made him so terribly ill. But toward the end he begins to think it may have come from a completely different source...<br /><br />Do yourself a favour and read these books!Dark's powers that made him so terribly ill.

He came into his own in \\"The Dark is Rising\\", finding the Six Signs, and now is joining the Drew children to search for the grail. An ancient soul in the body of a small boy, the Drews are initially none to pleased to find competition for their uncle's time and energy, but the search for the grail and the manuscript soon puts this out of their mind.<br /><br />Jane attends a women-only all-night festival that involves the making of something called \\"the Greenwitch\\", made of rock and branches. Tentatively she makes a wish for the vastly powerful and lonely being - a wish that could do what neither the Light nor the Dark can accomplish.

Despite multiple awards and a talent that is up there with the best of the fantasy authors, Susan Cooper's \\"The Dark is Rising\\" trilogy is often overlooked by readers in general. A five-part series, it deals with the battle between good and evil as waged by the Old Ones, several contemporary children, a range of mystical objects, and figures from history and legend.<br /><br />Like Alexander Lloyd's Prydain Chronicles (the best series with which these can be compared) it is the second book that is the most famous, and in this case it shares its title with the name of the overall series. \\"The Dark is Rising\\" is the story of eleven year old Will, who comes into his heritage as the youngest of the Old Ones: guardians of the world who fight against the malevolent Dark for the wellbeing of mankind. With his mentor Merriman, Will travels through the mighty Doors of Time, to learn his craft and skills, and then go up against the Black Rider - the strongest disciple of the Dark.<br /><br />All of this takes place from Midwinter's Eve to the Twelfth Night after Christmas, as the two separate powers' strength waxes and wanes. Will's role as the Sign-Seeker means that he must discover the location of six magical crossed stones representing different elements, and bring them all together to create the circle. As he searches his small village, the Dark releases its weapons against him: vicious rooks, an innocent-looking farm girl, a traitor, and finally a terrible snowfall that threatens the lives of Will's family, and the rest of the village. And through all of this is the mysterious tramp that sulks in the snow, fearing and hating Will, and yet with a terrible sadness to him that Will cannot understand.<br /><br />Will himself is not without strength and allies, and he faces adversary with the amazing personality that Cooper has shaped for him: the soul of an ancient inside the body and feelings of a small boy. He is perhaps one of the most fascinating, three-dimensional characters of children's fantasy literature, and has to be fully read to be understood.<br /><br />Cooper infuses her work with threads of real folklore and legend, everything from the old Celtic gods to the 'specialness' of a seventh son. Likewise, her language is simply stunning - she literally takes us from the fascination of a twig, to a raging river, to the planets and stars overhead. She also has a gift for invoking emotion, especially fear - Will's experiences with the forces of the Dark and the penetration of the snow are wonderfully, chillingly created.<br /><br />The previous story in this series was \\"Over Sea, Under Stone\\", which featured three completely different children (who meet Will in the next book \\"Greenwitch\\") in a setting that had much less emphasis on magical workings. In fact, when I first began reading this story I was initially rather confused and thought I'd picked up the wrong book. It does get off to a rather shaky start, with Will entering different worlds and times without the reader really knowing where he is, and how, and why. However, one must really read all of the books in order to gain the full picture of what's going on, as there is foreshadowing images here that do not come to fruition till the final book. It pays to read this more than once - it's one of those books that yields more information and detail each time.<br /><br />Will's family come across as clones of one another (there are differences, but not enough for me to be able to keep track of all the different siblings) but as a whole they are a cheerful, bickering, loving family. Merriman, who is the connecting element in all the books, is as aloof and grave as ever, and deserves a place among the great wizards of fantasy.<br /><br />Cooper is careful not to restrict the time period of her story (there is a new year, but she doesn't specify which one, and at one stage a character comments that most of his family was killed in \\"the last war\\". We assume it was World War II, but younger readers could interpret it as a later one).<br /><br />If you consider yourself a fantasy fan, then \\"The Dark is Rising\\" is must-read material. Beautifully crafted and endlessly fascinating, you should buy, not borrow this series.orld War II, but younger readers could interpret it as a later one). <br /> <br />If you consider yourself a fantasy fan, then \\"The Dark is Rising\\" is must-read material.

I feel a little guilty about the negative review I gave to this book's prequel \\"Ferren and the Angel\\", since this `Heaven and Earth' trilogy is original, exciting, interesting reading. But I still feel that with a little more work it could have gone from `good' to `excellent' and been placed among the likes of Philip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials.\\" Like those books, these deal with conflict between the forces of Heaven and the beings on Earth, but are set in this world, many years into the future.<br /><br />After scientists discovered that there was indeed life after death, mankind went about exploiting Heaven, resulting a collapse of the lower Altitudes onto Earth, an expulsion of all souls from Heaven (which now exist as woeful Morphs) and ongoing conflict between angels and Humens: the soulless mechanics ruled over by the Doctors. In between these two factions are the Residuals, ordinary people who are shunned by both sides and trying to scrape out a living on the wasted Earth.<br /><br />All that changed however when Miriael the angel crashed to Earth and was nursed back to health by Ferren, a young tribesman. Finding herself in a physical body, Miriael began to explore the world of the Residuals and realised they were not as savage as she once believed. Ferren himself explored the Camp of the Humens, and found out the terrible secret behind what they were doing with the tribesmen selected for military duty.<br /><br />Now the two of them travel the land, urging scattered Residual tribes to join together in a Residual Alliance. At the beginning of this second book in the trilogy, they have come upon the tribe of the Nesters, and are attempting to coax the Guardian Elders to join up against the Humens. The older population is not so keen, but they may have better luck convincing the younger generation. Amongst these youths are Kiet, a young woman who is struck by Ferren's ideas and stories and vows to come along with him when he moves on.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Miriael is being visited by a fellow angel named Asmodai who promises to speak on her behalf in the levels of Heaven and together with Kiet and Ferren, she discovers a new threat from the giant Doctor Saniette and his force of new war machines.<br /><br />\\"Ferren and the White Doctor\\" seemed to be a better read than the previous book, though perhaps that was because my expectations were not so high. Once again the chapters were too short (only three pages long), but because the characters were together for most of the story, it was easier to keep track of what was happening (unlike before, when the chapters were continuously switching viewpoints). Ferren is a much more interesting character this time around, perhaps because he's got more to do rather than simply watch other events unfolding, and Miriael is as good as ever. Kiet comes across a bit too much like Zondra of the previous book (what with a bad temper and rapid mood swings), but improves as the story goes on.<br /><br />Richard Harland has created a vivid representation of a future-Earth, along with a time-line and map that shows up what has gone on between 2005 - 3000AD, and how things stand when we enter the story. Likewise there is a range of interesting tribes and the customs they keep, and he has drawn on real angel-lore in order to create the hierarchical system that Miriael is a part of. One of my grievances of the first book was the lack of God in all the proceedings (surely a story set in Heaven warranted at least a mention of Him), but here there is reference to the `Supreme Trinity' in the Seventh Altitude of Heaven. It's not much, but it'll have to do.<br /><br />The best comparison of these books I can give is the \\"Mortal Engines\\" books by Philip Reeve, it has the same simple structure, clear writing and inventive post-apocalypse way of life. The third part of this trilogy is called \\"Ferren and the Invasion of Heaven,\\" and I'm interested enough to keep reading.while, Miriael is being visited by a fellow angel named Asmodai who promises to speak on her behalf in the levels of Heaven and together with Kiet and Ferren, she discovers a new threat from the giant Doctor Saniette and his force of new war machines. <br /> <br />\\"Ferren and the White Doctor\\" seemed to be a better read than the previous book, though perhaps that was because my expectations were not so high.

Never before have I read a book with such epic proportions, such potential and such originality - and yet was written so carelessly and simplistically. What promises to be a future-fantasy-adventure along the lines of Philip Pullman's amazing \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy, instead reads like sci-fi pulp fiction.<br /><br />\\"Ferren and the Angel\\" is set in the year 3000AD, after a series of scientific discoveries and heavenly experiments that resulted in a full out war between Heaven and Earth. The beginning of the book includes a time-line that includes entries such as `The Rising of the Undead', the `Depopulation of New York', `The Great Collapse' and of course `The Invasion of Heaven,' as well as a map of the world in the future, which show that Asia is now known as `The Burning Continents', North America is covered in ice, and there is an Atlantic Bridge reaching from Africa to South America.<br /><br />What's left of life is divided into three groups: Celestial Beings (angels) that are divided into many ranks of hierarchy, Humens who are ruled by the Doctors and wage war on the angels, and Residuals - the remains of ordinary humanity who live meagre, post-apocalyptic lives in the wastelands. In this group is Ferren, a young man who watches the lights and flashes of battle from underneath the roof of the Dwelling Place each night. It is here that he witnesses the fall of an angel from the skies, and investigates the next morning.<br /><br />Miriael is a junior angel who is devastated to find herself on the defiled Earth, and even more horrified once Ferren tells her that he has given her food and water whilst she was unconscious. Now in a physical body, she longs to return to Heaven, but at the same time is fascinated by the reason and kindness that Ferren displays, after being taught all her life that they were savages.<br /><br />But once Ferren's tribe (who has an alliance with the Humen and every year allows them to take recruitments for their armies) finds that he's had dealings with an angel, the two of them are captured and plans are made for them to be handed over the to the Humens. Ferren makes his escape, and believing that Miriael has already been taken to the Humen Camp, he begins the journey to rescue her - finding out the Humen's terrible secret on the way. Meanwhile, Miriael is uncovering secrets of her own, including the history of the world since 2005AD that resulted in such devastation.<br /><br />As you can see, the premise is utterly ingenious, and Harland has meticulously mapped out the history of the world since the fateful experiment of two scientists that brought back the dead from Heaven to a full-out war between Heaven and Earth that occurred once humans tried to exploit it. Now the Earth is ruled by the sinister doctors, who despise Heaven and the mysteries in it that go against their reasoning and logic.<br /><br />But the book suffers from a lack of pacing and poor characterisation. Chapters are only three pages long, and switch continually back and forth from Ferren and Miriael's point of view, making it difficult to really connect with what's going on. Although Miriael comes across nicely as a somewhat haughty angel that is half-disgusted, half-fascinated with the physicality of Earth, Ferren remains bland and uninteresting, with no real distinguishing features or talents (except his supposed `intelligence', which we are told he has rather than shown). All of the members of Ferren's tribe are named, but none have any individuality, except the wretched Zondra who is thoroughly unlikeable.<br /><br />As well as this, there are some confusing aspects to the story; for instance, Ferren's tribe worships a range of objects from the time when humanity ruled the Earth, including a can of Fly Spray, which they herald as `the Guardian Fly Spray.' But we are also told that these people cannot read - so how do they know it's fly spray? And even presuming that they did know what it was - why are they worshipping a can of Fly Spray?<br /><br />One of the most obvious questions presents itself right from the start: where is God during all of this? Harland does not even mention the presence or even the existence of an actual deity at work during all of this, but the most forgiving reader would probably raise questions as to why God permits Heaven to be overrun, and such tampering with human souls to occur in the first place.<br /><br />Despite all of this, I would still recommend \\"Ferren and the Angel\\". Its originality cannot be doubted, and it is an intriguing, swift-moving story that any fans of \\"His Dark Materials\\" might like, though Harland takes the opposite view of Pullman in his opinions of Heaven, technology and atheism. There's enough room for a sequel \\"Ferren and the White Doctor\\", that I've already picked up from the library (along with a third installment on the way). Yet despite my enjoyment of it, I couldn't help but feel that it could have been so much more.y are they worshipping a can of Fly Spray? <br /> <br />One of the most obvious questions presents itself right from the start: where is God during all of this?

Previously, young mermyd called Nia from the underwater city of Atlantis came ashore in order to find Gobiath, a squid-like Farworlder that rules Atlantis. He is one of the last of his kind after Atlantis was betrayed by the evil mermyd Ma'el and his Farworlder Joab, and now Nia is an Avatar (someone with physic links to a particular Farworlder) and the only one who can save her home. In book two she met up with Corwin, a young boy who unwillingly also became an Avatar to Gobiath and helped Nia in rescuing him from the tyrannical King Vortigern.<br /><br />Now the two of them face their final hurdle: together they swim down into the depth of Atlantis only to find the people enslaved and Ma'el ruthlessly ruling them all. Organising a rebellion, they use Nia's newfound power and Corwin's upbringing of trickery and theft. They feel the only way to gain the upper hand is to retrieve Eikis Calli Werr, the magical sword that promises peace, and with this they race once more up to the surface world to defeat Ma'el and his terrible kraken.<br /><br />The romance between Corwin and Nia was inevitable, but perhaps a little too simplistic, and the two of them are betrayed no less than three times in the course of the trilogy, rendering them a little silly for trusting everyone that comes along. Their mysterious parentage is hardly dwelt on (we never uncover the details about Nia's mother, and never hear anything about Corwin's parents at all) and so I'm not sure why Dalkey even bothered to put this in. But \\"Transformation\\" is a great end to an original and enjoyable trilogy, and Dalkey adds in some moments of genuine humour: \\"glowing sea snails!\\"<br /><br />Corwin continues his role as the protagonist, as most of the events are seen through his point of view, but thankfully Nia has a few shining moments of her own. The villains come across as genuinely powerful and threatening, and throughout Dalkey sprinkled touches of real lore and legend. Overall, a good read, especially for young fantasy lovers between nine and twelve.<br /><br />Whatever you do *don't* read the final pages before you get there (I know of several people who do this the moment they get a new book), as the small twist at the end is ingenious. If you've had a sneaking suspicion all along that Nia and Corwin were familiar faces in legend, then you may just be correct...ia has a few shining moments of her own.

The City is ruled by squid-like Farworlders, and their Avatars - mermyds that undergo a special bonding ritual that allows them to communicate with the Farworlders and govern Atlantis wisely. To be an Avatar is the highest honour a mermyd can achieve, and it is Nia's dream. She believes she has a good chance at winning the position against other young candidates from other clans, but is devastated when her family instead chooses her cousin Garun instead of her.<br /><br />The mystery deepens when Cephan, the young mermyd she likes, shows her a prisoner mermyd and a Farworlder that are kept as secret prisoners deep in the core of Atlantis. Nia is shocked at this, believing her city to be a purely benevolent citadel where things like dungeons and punishments are non-existent. The mystery deepens when Nia begins to suspect that her family is using magic to help Garun win the Seven Trials that each competitor must go through - and even her beloved grandfather Dyonis seems in on the conspiracy.<br /><br />\\"Ascension\\" is followed by two more books; \\"Reunion\\" and \\"Transformation\\" and this is a beginning worthy enough to track them down, even though I am not a fan of authors/publishers that needlessly split their books into more than one volume. It will appeal most to readers between ten and twelve, as it is quite a slender book but there is quite a lot of exposition put in concerning how the bond between Avatar and Farworlders works, how the city runs and the layout of the Trials.<br /><br />At times all of this is badly presented to the reader, often being too complicated or too contemporary (and with mentions of cloth existing underwater). For instance, there are references to \\"turtle-taxis\\" and \\"kelpaper journals,\\" as well as words such as \\"biochemical\\" and \\"having a crush (on someone)\\". This would not be so bad if the time-period was assumed to be contemporary, but as it turns out in later books, it's actually set in medieval times.<br /><br />But Atlantis itself is vividly portrayed, from its homes and markets, its meeting places and engineering mechanism and the \\"dry rooms\\" where air still exists to preserve documents. Kara Dalkey also has a gift with names, as all of the mermyds have appropriately aquatic, and somewhat Grecian names: Thalassa, Pelagia, Maru, Pontus and Callimar are just a few examples.<br /><br />Nia herself is a great heroine: smart, athletic, spunky, but not too good to be true - her faults make her a well-rounded person, err, mermyd. She's very easy to relate to, and her motivations are clear and understood. By the end of this particular phase in her life, most will be reaching for the next book. Also, in a completely unrelated statement, I think the cover art on this book (and the next two) are just beautiful.

In the previous book, the sixteen year old mermyd Niniane (called \\"Nia\\" for short), discovered betrayal and conspiracy in her underwater home of Atlantis. With the escape of an evil mermyd named Ma'el and the Farworlder (powerful, intelligent squid-like creatures) that he is telepathically connected to, Atlantis was overthrown and Nia the last living Farworlder were thrown ashore.<br /><br />The story picks up again from the point of view of Corwin, a young man whose master has recently been executed by the tyrannical King Vortigern and is now on the run himself. He makes his meager living as a beach-comber, and one this particular day he finds an extrodinary silvery shell but is soon chased from the shore by a terrible watery beast. He hopes that the shell will bring him some riches, but it is soon stolen by Vortigern's men despite the intervention of Nia herself, come ashore to save the young Farworlder-prince inside.<br /><br />Joining forces, Nia explains to Corwin her story, and that he himself bears the mark of the Avatar (the person chosen to be linked to the Farworlder), as does she. If they do not retrieve the shell then Atlantis will be destroyed, and furthermore their very lives will be forfeit - if they do not complete the Avatar ceremony then the toxins released into their bodies via the shell will kill them. Thus, on a time limit of five days the two set out to save the Farworlder, all the while avoiding the threat of Ma'el at their backs.<br /><br />The story is told exclusively from Corwin's point of view, which may be disappointing to those who were taken by Nia's wonderful character in the first book, but Corwin is an equally interesting, well-rounded character, though not as innately righteous as Nia - several times his thoughts stray towards thievery! Nia herself is remarkably able-footed on land, and heads the mission to save the Farworlder with a clear head and decisive leadership - though she's a bit too trusting toward Corwin, especially after her bad experience with Cephan.<br /><br />The story races along nicely, as the teenagers attempt to control their new-found magical abilities and sort out the telepathic link between them, and although there are a few too many narrow-escapes, \\"Reunion\\" is a decent follow-up to the previous book.

At the end of \\"The Subtle Knife\\", things were dire. Lyra had been kidnapped by her mother Mrs Coulter, whilst Will was left in the company of two angels with the subtle knife (which can create windows between worlds) and the altheiometer (that communicates with the mystery substance known as `Dust'). Refusing to accompany them to Lord Asriel, who is on the verge of war with Heaven itself, Will enlists the angels help in tracking down Lyra, and is soon joined by Iorek Byrnison, the king of the polar bears. Meanwhile, Lyra herself is forced into an enchanted sleep by her mother, whilst the powers of the Church and the Authority close in to end her life and thus the terrible threat she poses against them. When the two children are reunited, they hatch a plan to go right to the end of where the subtle knife can take them; right into death itself.<br /><br />Mary Malone, who has been told that she must \\"play the serpent\\", has reached a world where elephantine creatures wheel along on giant seedpods, and may just have the final key to unravelling the mystery of Dust. Pullman brings out all of his previous creations: witches, Spectres, angels, gyptains, daemons and cliff-ghasts are all here in full force, each with a part to play in one of the most exciting, controversial, imaginative and thought-provoking books in recent history. Yet unlike the previous books, \\"The Golden Compass\\" and \\"The Subtle Knife\\", \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" has a few faults that does not make it quite the awe-inspiring finale I had hoped it would be.<br /><br />Out of all three books, this one is the most blatantly anti-religious; in particular anti-Christian. Now, I have my own religious convictions (though what they are irrelevant to this review), and a critique of faith is hardly going to endanger them. It was easy enough for me to thoroughly enjoy a book without agreeing to its message. After all, religion is a human construct, and I'm sure I'm not the only religious person to recognise atrocities that have occurred by self-righteous fanatics in the name of `religion'. But Pullman takes this one step further and is anti-God. In his literary creation, God was not the creator, but simply the first intelligent being to come into existence. Again, I wasn't that disgruntled: I had to admire the sheer nerve Pullman displays in taking on the concept of God, and anyone who has read \\"Paradise Lost\\" (on which these books are based) know that Satan comes across as an epic hero, whilst God is somewhat of a bore.<br /><br />No, what bothered me about this book was the general attitude held toward all religious people: at all times there is no good that can come from having faith in a deity of any kind, and no chance of a coexistence between those that have faith and those that don't. In my opinion, the key to peace on earth is not religion, nor atheism, but *tolerance*. Pullman displays none of this, and seems to be saying that only way to deal with religious people is with scorn and mockery. Any impressionable young reader will most likely be inspired and enlightened by Pullman's books, but on taking his standpoint, they may also adopt a negative attitude toward anyone that does not conform to atheist beliefs. Just as the stereotype of a Christian is an uptight, Bible-bashing bigot, atheists are steadily coming across as smug, arrogant dictators. Neither is particularly becoming, and the differences between the two extremes aren't really that different. I say again, tolerance is what the world needs, and Pullman shows none of this.<br /><br />As well as this, there are some very basic mistakes, which come across as sloppy writing - something I thought I'd never, ever accuse Pullman of doing. Serafina is practically forgotten, and the plot thread concerning the arrow she prepares for Mrs Coulter comes to an empty conclusion. Huge amounts of time are given to preparing Asriel's army and the forces he controls, and yet we never hear the outcome of this physical battle.

Lyra claims that she overheard the witch-consul Lanselius comments on her role in the witch-prophesy. But in book 1 Pullman specifically states: \\"She must fulfil this destiny in ignorance of what she is doing.\\" If she'd overheard this, then she wouldn't be in ignorance, and the prophecy negates itself. As well as this, Pullman tells us that the prophecy concerning Lyra's betrayal occurs when she leaves Pan behind when she crosses into the land of the dead. Not only do I fail to see how this was a betrayal (she had no choice!), but I thought the betrayal had occurred in book 1 when Lyra led Roger to his death. Because I thought it had already happened, my anticipation hadn't been building up for this `real' betrayal.<br /><br />Then there's the matter of the Gallivespians. Although they are wonderful creations (miniature people with poisonous spurs on their heels) the two that accompany Will and Lyra have no real purpose. The altheiometer insists that they are needed, but on close inspection all they do is convince the harpies of a deal, and get Lyra angry enough to see her Death. In other words, they do squat, at least not enough that justifies their presence, and do nothing that Will and Lyra couldn't do themselves.<br /><br />At the end of the day, \\"His Dark Materials\\" is essential reading, and I don't think any book has stimulated my mind as much as these. Despite some faults in this final book, and an infuriating sense of superiority in the narrator's voice, I have read the trilogy numerous times and enjoy it more each time. Thanks Philip Pullman for an unforgettable, intoxicating, extraordinary read - but I'm still not an atheist..

The intoxicating blurb tells us: \\"This is one of those books which hides within itself a secret, a story deeper than it is possible to convey from this blurb or from the cover. We urge you to read it.\\" What reader could possibly turn away from a promise like that? Expecting an instant classic, a profound read and a memorable experience, I began to read \\"The Cup of the World,\\" only to find that it is a typical generic fantasy novel - not bad by any means, but hardly living up to what the publishers wrote on the blurb.<br /><br />Phaedra is the only daughter of the Warden of Trant, a key citadel in a land that is continuously threatened by war and rebellion. Because of her beauty and the power that her father wields, she is a most desirable bride for whoever should win her hand, but Phaedra herself is not so keen. Travelling home from the king's court with Aun of Lackmere, an ex-rebel who is exiled to Trant, Phaedra worries constantly about being forced into an arranged marriage, when her whole life she's been captivated by the man who visits her in her dreams. Connected together by the water of a strange stone cup, she and Ulfin have met for years in a dreamscape, and now in her desperation Phaedra agrees to run away with him. But he is the ruler of Tarceny, a citadel that is not loyal to the king and his sons and is surrounded by rumours of bad luck and black magic.<br /><br />I better not give too much more away, for although the secret/twist of the novel is not as earth-shattering as it sounds, it is one that shouldn't be given away should you decide to track down this book. It reads a little like an M. Night Shymalan movie, in that all the clues to what's really going on are placed in front of you, but not enough factual information is given for you to work it out yourself. Let's just say that things are not what they seem in Phaedra's new life, though she is only aware of this on the most basic level, like a deep undercurrent of things being kept from her, running through her life in such a way that she hardly aware of it. From a circle of white sons around her son, to the permeating sense of her deceased father-in-law's cruelty, to the disappearance of the strange priest that married her, to her friend (and rumoured witch) Evalia's elusive nature. Against a tapestry of political manoeuvring and intrigue, most people who begin this story will be compelled to finish it.<br /><br />The story takes place over several years, from Phaedra's maidenhood to marriage to motherhood, and the fantasy realm is quite well presented, from the castles and homes to the wide and rocky countryside. It actually reminded me a little bit of Lloyd Alexander's Prydain, and Dickinson creates a wonderful sense of religion, whether it be the calling on of the four Angels, or the `Under-craft'. Phaedra unfortunately is not the most riveting of heroines - I never felt particularly close to her, nor sympathetic to her plight, and often her behaviour comes across as quite cold and/or snobbish (even for a high-born lady, there is a limit!)<br /><br />Although the book is a bit thicker than it needs to be, no one can fault John Dickinson's beautiful language: so often other fantasy writers destroy their work by adding in contemporary words that destroy the mood and setting of the book. Dickinson has none of this, and beautifully draws together his elegant, archaic words to make the entire book feel authentic and natural. As well as this, there is the on going image of black and white, beautifully portrayed in the movement of chess pieces...<br /><br />However, at the end of the day, this is another typical fantasy novel that I perhaps would have given a higher rating to if I haven't been so excited by the blurb. If you read it, you'll enjoy it, and then you'll most likely forget it.unning through her life in such a way that she hardly aware of it.

But Time City is slowly running down, (helped along with the tampering of rouge time-travellers) and the legendary founder Faber John is the only being that is able to renew it. It is told that four caskets of Gold, Silver, Iron and Lead may save the city, but only the mysterious Time Lady can awaken Faber John.<br /><br />Jonathon and Sam, two sons of important families within the City have decided to take matters into their own hands. After seeing a \\"time-ghost\\" (a visual imprint of an important moment) they travel through a time-lock into History for an adventure of their own that they haven't even begun to sort out. There, Jonathon grabs Vivian Smith, the girl that they are certain is the Time Lady.<br /><br />Vivian Smith however, is soon to correct them - she's just a normal girl who was being evacuated with hundreds of other children from World War II. Now with no way back, and the concept of Time itself in jeopardy, Vivian agrees to help the boys uncover the mystery of Faber John (and keep them out of trouble while she's doing it). Racing through time to collect the four caskets before their enemies, the trio have to dodge androids, teachers, time-ghosts and antagonistic locals in order to save Time City.<br /><br />Though I enjoyed \\"A Tale of Time City\\", it is not my favourite Diana Wynne Jones book; perhaps because I'm not a big sci-fi fan, perhaps because time-travelling stories utterly confuse me. I'm never sure what happened when, or what the true chronological order of the events are. But as usual, there is a lot in this DWJ book to recommend it, and it is packed full of creativity and enjoyment - such as the \\"butter-pies\\", cold on the outside and warm on the inside. Likewise, she gives us some future events to look forward to, such as the Mind Wars, the Forth World War and the Depopulation of Earth.<br /><br />Time City itself is a great idea, (complete with architecture, social customs, and low opinions of those that live in 'history') and is vividly brought to life, but this is not really a book for younger readers, as the plot is quite twisty and complicated, and the ending a little bittersweet. But for a DWJ book that is a bit different, or a science-fiction book that is truly unique within the genre, then give this one a try.recommend it, and it is packed full of creativity and enjoyment - such as the \\"butter-pies\\", cold on the outside and warm on the inside.

Here it is finally, the fifth and final book in the Spiderwick Chronicles, which told the tale of the Grace children and their run-ins with faeries of every shape and form. Picking straight up from the end of \\"The Ironwood Tree\\", Mallory, Simon and Jared wearily return home from the underground kingdom of the dwarfs to find their house ransacked and their mother missing. Realising that the terrible ogre Mulgarath is behind the chaos, the children ally themselves with previous characters Thimbletack the house-brownie, Hogsqueal the hobgoblin and Byron the griffin in order to find Mulgarath and save their mother.<br /><br />Their quest leads them once more to the grove of the unfriendly elves, a junkyard full of goblins and the terrible castle-home of Mulgarath himself. On the way we are treated to the wonderful illustrations of Tony DiTerlizzi, including his serpentine dragonets, a wonderful dragon/griffin battle in midair, the ominous Mulgarath, and a meeting with the famous Arthur Spiderwick himself. At all times DiTerlizzi's pictures are the high point of these beautiful bound and presented books, and all the faery creatures are portrayed with a touch of darkness to them - these are not the sweet and merry Enid Blyton-esqe creatures. Instead they are as faeries were originally conceived: beautiful, but more than a little dangerous.<br /><br />Many of the other reviews claim that this final book was a `satisfying conclusion', but I must say I disagree. Although it was a reasonable enough ending, I had simply been expecting more from this series. The children are tricked too easily by Mulgarath's deception, Mulgarath himself is defeated too easily, and the ending too swift and abrupt, despite a tantalising rhyming finish that asks us: \\"Are there more ogres and dragons to slay?/ Is there more mayhem, perhaps on the way?\\" It would seem that the story of the Grace children hasn't quite finished yet.<br /><br />But I was still expecting more from this ending, especially in regard to previously established characters and plot devices. I had hoped the phooka and the elves would turn up to help fight, as well as any dwarfs that may have survived (and many of their inventions would have come in handy in the battle against Mulgarath). I was almost certain that Thimbletack would revert to his boggart-form in order to help, and that Byron would swoop in at a timely moment to do something drastic. Never happened. Likewise, the Field Guide has been the focus of the last four books, and logic dictated that there was something vitally important within its pages that would help defeat Mulgarath, or help the children in their quest. Nope. The Guide is virtually forgotten in this book.<br /><br />It just felt as though Holly Black had put a lot of effort into dropping clues and characters in the previous books that would have been helpful, all leading up to a dramatic conclusion and then neglects to use them. But despite all my grumblings, \\"The Spiderwick Chronicles\\" was a worthy set of books that is well worth reading - they are inventive, quirky, funny, easy to read, and full of `real' faery lore and information.

Finally I clicked three, but what it really deserves is two and a half stars, putting it exactly midpoint between good and just fair. Though it has an interesting premise and full of fascinating facts and ideas, it often falls short on several accounts.<br /><br />Pip and Tim are two twins that have just moved into an old, mysterious house called Rawne Barton: your standard beginning for a fantasy story of this nature. Before long, the siblings have uncovered a strange boy hidden in the walls of the house named Sebastian who claims to be the son of a medieval alchemist. He has been in a drugged sleep for the last six centuries, and now awoken in order to battle his father's enemy de Loudeac. In league with the devil himself, de Loudeac plans to create a homunculus, a being made out of dead matter that will do his bidding. Sebastian tells the twins that even now de Loudeac is gathering the ingredients he needs from the countryside.<br /><br />Whilst Sebastian goes about his own mysterious business, the twins do their best to continue their day to day chores, but inevitably they are caught between Sebastian and de Loudeac's struggle. Martin Booth's strength throughout the story is also his weakness, and that is that he incorporates a lot of real history and facts about alchemy into the work. These touches are excellent, as they brought a sense of resonance and `realness' to the story, but at the same time they will only be appealing for those that already have a basic understanding of some of these historical figures and alchemical principles.<br /><br />I was halfway in the middle, enjoying and appreciating some of the touches that were not just put in the story for their own sake, but actually *used*, but at other times struggling to sort out the myriad of names and facts and figures that he gives us.<br /><br />Despite this however, Booth wonderfully matches ancient alchemy with their counterparts in modern day.<br /><br />The characters are also quite problematic: Sebastian is an interesting enigma that lights up the page, but the twins are less enjoyable. Tim spends most of the beginning of the book denying that all the weird and wonderful events around him aren't real - this is a waste of time considering 1. They obviously are happening, and 2. When a reader opens a fantasy book, they are already agreeing to the rules of normality being broken - the author doesn't need to over-explain or justify the supernatural. Second of all, Pip isn't actually a strong heroine. Looking at Booth's previous publications, which are mostly war and survival stories (with boys as the protagonists), I came to the conclusion that Booth simply doesn't know how to portray females. Throughout the story, she is mostly shown gardening, shopping and being attacked, whilst Tim does the most to push the story along. When the final conflict does come, the boys use her as a decoy (though to be fair, she does manage to knock an enemy on the head with a rock).<br /><br />Some things are introduced only to be forgotten, such as the mysterious bottle at the school and a cameo appearance from the devil, but I assume these are devices will be continued in the second book.

After the colossal disappointment of the last book in the Sweep series \\"Full Circle\\", I was both relieved and wary that another conclusion had been written. \\"Night's Child\\" is set several years after the events of \\"Full Circle\\" with Morgan and Hunter as twenty-something year olds. Proposing marriage, Hunter plans to settle down and run New Charter (the new alternative to the Council) from home. He has only one last journey to make, and it is here that disaster strikes. The ferry he is travelling on sinks, and no trace is found of Hunter, dead or alive.<br /><br />The story picks up again fifteen years later: Morgan had married a man named Colm and they had a daughter named Moira. Unfortunately Colm was killed in a car accident and now Morgan and Moira live together in Ireland, members of the Belwicket coven. Despite this tragedy, the two of them are happy enough - despite the rivalry between Belwicket and another coven led by Lilith Delaney that is rumoured to dabble in black magic.<br /><br />But then things begin to happen: Morgan finds dark magic littered around her front garden, and objects on the ground that remind her of Hunter. When Moira begins dating Ian Delaney, Lilith's son, Morgan is terrified the past is repeating itself in terms of her history with Selene and Cal. Afraid for her daughter Morgan begins an investigation to find who is behind these attacks - could it be to do with her father's family? Are Lilith and Ian really dangerous? Is it possible that Hunter is still alive? Is another dark wave looming?<br /><br />At times, especially near the beginning, the writing is slow and sluggish with detailed descriptions of Moira's witchcraft classes and Morgan's healing rites. Often Tiernan repeats or contradicts herself several times in the text, for instance, Morgan thinks: \\"To end a relationship with her soulmate was fighting destiny.\\" On the very next page we are told: \\"With the way things were, they had to pursue their separate destinies.\\" Er - is it just me, or did Tiernan just tell us that soulmates shared the *same* destinies? There are several more inconsistencies like this throughout the story.<br /><br />Furthermore, Tiernan's grasp of Irish dialect is painful to behold: \\"Away with ya\\" and \\"what a beautiful day, nae?\\" appear clumsy and inaccurate. Although the main culprit behind the attacks is an innovative idea, Tiernan drives home the possibility of Ian being evil so many times that it becomes fairly certain he *isn't*.<br /><br />Readers may be vastly disappointed at the lack of characters appearing from previous books. Bree, Robbie, Raven, Alyce, Alwyn, Mary K. and Morgan's parents are all given brief updates on where they are and what they're doing, but the rest of the Kithic coven are completely forgotten. Alisa is mentioned, but no information is given on what she's now up to, which is really quite unforgivable considering Tiernan devoted an entire book to her in the series. Killian turns up briefly and out of the blue, and then just as inexplicitly disappears. Daniel Niall is mentioned several times, but no information is given on either him or his other son Linden. Dagda is dead. Only Sky is given a useful and interesting place within the context of the story.<br /><br />Yet despite all this, \\"Night's Child\\" was the conclusion to this series that I was hoping for. Morgan is a reasonable portrayal of the teenager we knew in the series, and Moira is a likeable, spunky young heroine who reacts realistically enough to the situation unfolding around her. There are some nice new characters, such as Morgan's mother-in-law Katrina, and toward the end the plot unfolds quickly and excitingly. This should definitely be the end of the \\"Sweep\\" series, as Tiernan only just gets away with recycling several old ideas (ie, a replay of the Selena/Cal storyline, another dark wave, another threat from Morgan's family) and it wraps up nearly every loose end from the other books. Despite its faults, I was satisfied with this ending.satisfied with this ending.	2004-10-27
US	39424751	R3NVPGWKWAV12S	0679879250	872660777	The Subtle Knife (His Dark Materials, Book 2)	Books	5	3	4	N	N	"We Heard Angels, Moving Toward the Pole..."	\\"The Subtle Knife\\" is the second in Philip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy, beginning with \\"The Golden Compass\\" and ending with \\"The Amber Spyglass\\". It is an amazing piece of literature; often more suited for adult readers than for the children/young adults that it's geared toward, and with a message that - though controversial - is immensely thought provoking and worth pondering. Strangely enough, this second book is actually my favourite installment in the series; odd since middle books are often those that flounder.<br /><br />At the end of \\"The Golden Compass\\", Lyra and her daemon Pantalaimon walked into the Northern Lights, across the bridge Lord Asriel had made and into another world. Readers might be disconcerted therefore to begin the book without Lyra in sight. Instead, Pullman introduces us to Will Parry, a young boy who has spent his whole life trying to look inconspicuous. His father went missing when he was just a baby, and his mother is often mentally unwell - and lately strange men have been coming to the house to harass his beloved mother and investigate his absent father. Putting his mother into the care of a friendly neighbour, Will ends up finding a case of letters that the men were after, and in the scuffle that follows, one of them ends up dead. Now a fugitive and a murderer, Will takes to the streets, and finds refuge in the most astonishing place - in the middle of the footpath Will watches a cat disappear into thin air. Following it, Will climbs through a window into another world.<br /><br />In the beautiful, silent, Mediterranean city known as Cittagazze Will finds a companion - Lyra, who is still on her mission to find and discover the mystery of Dust. The two compare stories and figure out their next move: Will wants to find his father, and Lyra wants a scholar that can help her untangle what Dust is, the strange substance that causes her altheiometer to answer any question she poses to it. The altheiometer tells Lyra to help Will find his father, but when her device is stolen by a strangely familiar man, the two children are faced with a new ultimatum: to fetch an artefact known as the Subtle Knife, which resides in the Torre degli Angeli in Cittagazze.<br /><br />With the sound of mustering angel wings in the sky, and savage children roaming the streets, Lyra and Will face danger, intrigue, beauty and suspense in this truly wonderful sequel. Whilst Lord Asriel gathers forces to him for a war not seen since the last battle of Heaven, the terrible Mrs Coulter goes about her own sinister purposes. Lyra enrols the physicist Mary Malone to her cause by teaching her how to communicate with the conscious Dust through her computer, whilst Sir Charles Latrom plans her downfall. The witch Serafina Pekkala and her clan of witches met with Lee Scoresby the aeronaut who vows to find the elusive Stanislaus Grumman, who has valuable information for Asriel and the new bearer of the Subtle Knife.<br /><br />And throughout all of this is a new, even deadlier threat - throughout the street of Cittagazze roam the Spectres, unseen by children, but deadly to adults who are subject to their very essence being devoured. Pullman effortlessly pulls these new mysteries together, enriching and expanding the worlds that he has created and piling on new facts and information to a deep and elusive pattern that the reader can barely see moving under the characters' actions. Whilst Lyra and Will go about their own activities, you can tell that insurmountable forces are rising up around them. Little touches of intrigue are everywhere: the artefacts in the museum that Lyra recognises from her own world, or the blade of the subtle knife that is exactly that of the blade at Bolvangar. All of these details go unexplained, and serve only as tiny bits of fascinating circumstance.<br /><br />Some may feel a bit put off at the change in protagonist, from Lyra to Will (who dominates this, and most of the third book), but I actuallyliked Will better. Most readers will prefer the feisty Lyra, but the quiet, focused Will was a character I could grasp and understand easier than Lyra. In any case, both of these characters (and Pan of course) are fundamental to the unravelling of the plot and make a great team together, especially when they combine the powers of the altheiometer and the Subtle Knife.<br /><br />As I said \\"The Subtle Knife\\" is my favourite installment in the series, and a book you can read several times, finding deeper meaning and added detail every time. As always, the criticism Pullman poses against organised religion (in particular, the Catholic Church) is controversial, but I found it easy enough to enjoy the book without totally agreeing to its message. This gets a bit more difficult in \\"The Amber Spyglass\\", when the message gets a lot more heavy-handed, but for now \\"The Subtle Knife\\" reads more as a remarkable adventure through several worlds where unseen forces are slowly on the move.t I actually liked Will better.

Followed by \\"The Subtle Knife\\" and \\"The Amber Spyglass\\", the books have a huge range of ideas and meanings; from exploring the bond between the body and soul, to denouncing modern religious practices, to retelling Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\" from a completely different point of view. Throughout, the story is compelling and beautifully told, the source of endless debates and discussions, and a narrative with such an extreme and unique message that (even if you don't agree with it) you have to admire the sheer gall that Pullman has in delivering it within a book aimed for children.<br /><br />This first part is set in a parallel world that contains England's Oxford, very much like ours but with some major differences. For starters, it feels like a turn-of-the-century time period, though more astonishing are creatures known as \\"daemons\\", who are soon revealed to be the external presence of human souls in animal forms. Every single human being has one, who is bonded inexorably to their human. In this world lives a young girl named Lyra, an orphan placed in the care of Jordan College. Lyra is a half-wild creature, who's perfectly happy in her life of exploration, fighting, telling stories and daring feats with her particular friend Roger and of course her beloved daemon Pantalaimon.<br /><br />But something is slowly disrupting Lyra's happy existence, and events seem to be on the move that she cannot begin to understand. After she creeps into the men-only Retiring Room of the College she overhears an astonishing conversation that results in her saving her uncle Asriel's life. There she first hears the idea of \\"North\\". Captivated by this dream of snow, ice and the Northern Lights, Lyra is only distracted by another looming threat - creatures known as the Gobblers. Throughout the streets of England, children are disappearing, and their mysterious fates are blamed on \\"the Gobblers\\". Who or what these creatures are become vitally important to Lyra once Roger disappears, and she vows to find him and bring him back to safety.<br /><br />And so, from the home of the beautiful and sinister Mrs Coulter and her vindictive golden monkey daemon, to the canal boats and fierce loyalty of the gyptains (water-gypsies), to the magnificent scope of the north, where talking armoured bears roam the snow and witches fly on pine-branches through the sky, and finally into the clutches of the terrible Gobblers themselves. To guide her is a precious artefact, a device known as an altheiometer (the namesake of the book) that can answer any question posed to it by use of arrows that point to various pictures around its edge, and a mysterious substance known as \\"Dust\\", that everyone seems to hate and fear.<br /><br />What is Dust? What is the link between it, daemons and children? What force causes the altheiometer to work? What are Lord Asriel's plans? What is Lyra's part to play in all of this? And what lies beyond the Northern Lights? Pullman raises a myriad of intriguing questions that keep you turning pages all through this book, and the next two. With almost effortless skill he creates the three-dimensional world of Oxford, with all its winding streets, shaky buildings and colourful characters. In terms of `fantasy' lands, the Oxford that Pullman has created ranks up there with the best sub-created worlds in literature, and he visits it again in the small novella \\"Lyra's Oxford.\\"<br /><br />Pullman is just brimming with original and fascinating ideas, from the enigma of Dust, to the presence of daemons to the carefully constructed altheiometer that Lyra soon masters. On top of this we have a usurped bear-kingdom with a false king, a beautiful witch in love with a mortal, aging man, a Texan aeronaut who flies a balloon, and asecret concerning Lyra's own parentage. The layers and detail that Pullman manages to pack into this work is just astounding, and you can read it over and over again, finding something new each time.<br /><br />Which brings me to Lyra herself. A refreshing change from the usual female-figures of literature, this young girl is bad-tempered, brattish, determined and even somewhat selfish. To a point I feel that Pullman may have gone a tad over the top in adding these emotions to his young heroine, as later on in the book it was rather hard for me to reconcile these less-than-outstanding attributes to the love and devotion that she later displays. Of course, in many ways this is a coming-of-age story, and one must start out as a spoilt child in order to grow to a deeper sense of maturity - and throughout is the presence of Pan, who often reveals the more vulnerable side to Lyra's temperament. But for any adult expecting to find a role model for their children, it's doubtful you'll find it here, as her greatest gift in life is her ability to create and maintain believable lies - and she's immensely proud of this skill!<br /><br />Another word of warning - there are elements of anti-Christianity at work, especially as the series goes on. It's not too noticeable in this first book, but the Catholic Church is unfortunately portrayed in a very black light. However, unless you are an extremely close-minded and/or sensitive Christian, it's reasonably easy to read Pullman's work as a criticism against power, corruption and control rather than religion itself - and let's face it, the Catholic Church doesn't exactly have a spotless record in the course of human history. And ultimately, you don't have to agree with a book's message to enjoy reading it.<br /><br />And please don't think that the \\"daemons\\" are supposed to be demonic - that's just silly. Our word \\"demon\\" is based on a Greek word \\"daimon\\" which means \\"soul\\". Yes, that's right - our word \\"demon\\" comes from a word meaning \\"soul\\"!oon, and a secret concerning Lyra's own parentage.

This wizard is no grey-bearded aged old man, but a young handsome character whose responsibility it is to keep in balance all magic in all the worlds.<br /><br />All of the books except this one are set in a parallel version of Britain, and in a foreword to this story Diana Wynne Jones explains that here Italy never became a united country, and is still split up into states - one of which is Caprona. Caprona is a beautiful city, watched from above by the great Angel of Caprona atop the Cathedral, who long ago drove out the White Devil. The only blight upon the city is the ongoing feud between its two major families: the Montanas and the Petrocchis.<br /><br />In case you haven't guessed by now, there are indeed hints of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" at work. But in typical Wynne Jones style, the story is not told from the lovers' point of view, but rather from younger members of both families - predominantly Tonino and Paolo Montana. Like all the children of their family, they've been raised to hate the Petrocchis, and the rumours of a coming war against Caprona raises ill-will even higher.<br /><br />But a visit from Chrestomanci reveals that he believes an evil enchanter is at work, though their identity is a mystery unknown even to him. The only way that they can save the city is to find the missing words to the Angel of Caprona song, and to do that it seems that the families will have to work together.<br /><br />But then Tonino and Angelica Petrocchi disappear, the two most notoriously bad spell-casters of the families. While kept hostage, the two simultaneously discover the identity of the enchanter and the words to the song. But how can they get this information to their families, especially when the fighting has escalated?<br /><br />\\"The Magician of Caprona\\" is probably the easiest to read of all the Chrestomanci books, and combines all of Wynne Jones's trademark features - zany magic, talking cats, clever twists and vivid characters who still act like normal people despite the magic happenings occurring around them. It moves between funny and somewhat scary, with a range of likeable characters throughout.n of Caprona\\" is probably the easiest to read of all the Chrestomanci books, and combines all of Wynne Jones's trademark features - zany magic, talking cats, clever twists and vivid characters who still act like normal people despite the magic happenings occurring around them.

Perhaps a better description of this book would be to call it a spin-off, as it is has several characters from the previous Sally books as its protagonists, and solves a mystery that has been brewing since book one. In the first book \\"The Ruby in the Smoke,\\" a young street waif named Adelaide Bevan disappeared into the streets of London, and only now has she been found. Readers who may be unwilling to continue with this series due to the absence of Sally are instead rather forced to - it's the only way to find out what happened to that young girl.<br /><br />Jim Taylor, the amateur detective (among other things) has finally managed to track her down, following the trail of young Rebecca Winter who has been employed in the service of a nobleman to teach a young woman in his household how to read and write. The two collide almost immediately, and soon it becomes apparent that the young woman in question is none other than Adelaide herself. But her situation has greatly changed - she is married to Prince Rudolf of Razkavia, making her a princess of that small country squished between Austria and Germany. Rebecca is appalled at the unlikelihood of the match, especially since she herself is a native of Razkavia.<br /><br />And now things are about to heat up. With the assassination of Rudolf's older brother, Adelaide and her husband now find themselves heir to the thrones of Razkavia - but whoever was behind the conspiracy to topple the royal family is not going to stop till they control the country. Now with Becky as her translator and Jim as her bodyguard, Adelaide is travelling with her husband to the country she now rules - a country watched over by the Red Eagle flag. Legend says that so long as the Eagle flies over the Rock of Eschtenburg, Razkavia will always be free. Now in a strange land, with strange customs, and a plot against them, Adelaide, Jim and Becky must juggle politics, public relations, personal safety, betrayal within the court, assassination attempts and a mysterious missing member of the royal family. Needless to say (of any of Philip Pullman's books), it's a very exciting ride.<br /><br />Pullman beautifully creates an entire country with vivid realness - its customs, economy, language, history, all of it comes across with perfect realism, but also a sense of intrigue that he can invoke so well: \\"The streets are so crooked and narrow that they have no names...the Devil went there once, and couldn't find his way out. Which means of course, that he's still there.\\" Likewise, the characters are vivid and immensely likeable, and his themes of power and corruption (which appear in all of his books in one way or another) are in place. Of our main characters, only Becky is initially unfamiliar to readers of the Lockhart books, but she soon becomes an interesting figure, who wields her own type of power in being Adelaide's translator (often stating her straightforward opinions to Princess Adelaide in the course of conversations, or rewording Adelaide's informal slang to the listener).<br /><br />But it's Jim and Adelaide that really take centre stage in the course of this story - passionate, strong, out of their league, star-crossed and determined, I have to say that I think they are Pullman's best romantic couple (disagree with me if you must, but that includes Sally/Fred and even Lyra/Will). Adelaide definitely foreshadows Lyra for the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy - willful, spoilt, cunning and yet with a strange sense of innocence about her. Glancing at some of the other reviews, it's unfortunate to see she's rather unpopular - I thought she was a wonderful character, and every inch a queen.<br /><br />Of those that are disappointed at the lack of Sally, there's no reason to completely despair. She is present at both the beginning and end of the story (as is Goldberg, her husband - sadly, no Harriet or Trembler) and is mentioned throughout by several characters. And in her own way, she plays a very big part in the course of the story - just watch how useful the knitted jersey she makes for Jim turns out!<br /><br />Although this is not my favourite book in the series (that would be \\"The Tiger in the Well\\") it is the most re-readable, the most intriguing and the most poetic - the final passage in particular is beautifully written. I won't give it away, but I often find myself picking up the book just to read it again, and the images that Pullman invokes, especially in the escape from the old palace through the snow, are just beautiful. There is a certain amount of cynicism, but the barest touches of hope in the conclusion of the story.

Despite the prolonged absence of Jim Taylor, it is the darkest of the books, where the stakes are at their highest. Whilst Jim Taylor and Webster Garland are away on holiday, Sally receives a letter from a man named Mr Parrish, who claims that she is his wife and her baby daughter Harriet is his own. Making it worse, it accuses her of being an unfit mother, and that custody of Harriet should be given to Parrish. Sally is horrified - not only has she never heard of this man before, but the law is not on her side. Somehow there exists a marriage certificate for the two of them, and a birth certificate that testifies Parrish is Harriet's daughter. Despite help from her financial consultant Margaret Haddow and the servants of the house, Sally's case in a court of law seems hopeless - her lawyer didn't even know that Harriet was a girl! There seems only one thing to do, and that's take Harriet and disappear.<br /><br />And so Sally and her daughter become fugitives, sinking from hotel rooms to poor houses to the street, whilst the law steadily closes in on her. How can she investigate the mystery surrounding her when she must also look after a baby? Soon however, she comes into the path of a man named Daniel Goldberg, a Jewish political writer who claims that they can help one another - he can give Sally a safe place for Harriet, and she can help him uncover the identity of the Tzaddik. This man is one who few have seen, but is feared by almost all, especially the Jewish community. They say he has a `dybbuk' for a servant, a little imp from hell that waits on him, and that he controls almost all the underworld dealings. More importantly however, Goldberg believes that he is behind Sally's dilemma.<br /><br />\\"The Tiger in the Well\\" is definitely my favourite Sally Lockhart book, where Pullman excels himself in his writing skills. The predicament that Sally finds herself in is truly frightening - just think, at any moment your life could be pulled out from under your feet because of spiteful unknown powers. Her gradual decline is realistic and unsettling, and is made especially difficult with the presence of a young child (one who isn't potty trained and is slightly feverish to boot). Often she seems to be hanging at the end of a thread, and it's scary to see this capable woman put in such a position. In such cases, Pullman often gives us the most poignant scenes, such as a waiter advising Sally to change her give-away accent, or of Sally turning in shock, certain that Fred Garland (Harriet's father) is behind her.<br /><br />For those who missed them in \\"The Shadow in the North\\", Rosa and Trembler make appearances, and although Jim Taylor is away for most of the book, he does return in time to make a splash with the invaders who take over his house. But this is mostly Sally's book, especially since we see her both at her strongest, and her most vulnerable.<br /><br />Pullman also uses Daniel Goldberg has a device to highlight the exploitation of Jews and other immigrants coming into England, and the prejudice held against them - two realities that are sadly going on even today. Perhaps what comes across most vividly in the stories is the readiness with which people are prepared to turn on unknown foreigners, and eagerly foster their hate for those who seem to have more then them. Likewise is the truly appalling plan that the Tzaddik had organised for Harriet - I won't give it away, but it's just horrible, almost unthinkable. One thing that I didn't like however was the huge `deux ex machina' that Pullman instigates in order to resolve the story - for someone who presents himself as an atheist, he certainly heavily relies on the Hand of God in order to save Sally. Some fans of Fred may also not like the new love interest for Sally, and I myself thought it was a bit unnecessary (especially considering that Sally has always been presented asan independent young woman), but it certainly doesn't overshadow the more important aspects of the book.<br /><br />\\"The Tiger in the Well\\" is also the book that has quite a bit of foreshadowing for Pullman's more famous works, the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy, including a nasty little monkey, the power of stories, and even a glass of Tokay. It's always interesting linking up stories by the same author, and there are other little thematic touches that appear both here, and in the \\"Materials\\" trilogy. The Sally Lockhart books can be read out of order, but if you want to get the best out of this one, I definitely suggest reading \\"The Ruby in the Smoke\\" first - the Tzaddik's true identity won't have the same resonance if you don't.<br /><br />One last note: the Amazon editorial review is from an entirely different book, and must have been posted on the wrong web page.

Sally Lockhart, our Victorian heroine who was raised to think more like a contemporary woman, is now self-employed as a business consultant. Her companions Frederick Garland and Jim Taylor are amateur detectives and professional photographers, and despite a growing attraction/animosity between Sally and Fred, all seems well. But then one of her clients, Miss Walsh, comes to her office to inform her that she has lost all of her money after taking Sally's advice and investing in a ship that has since disappeared. The subsequent event of the firm's downfall seems to be linked to a man named Axel Bellman, the richest man in Europe, who is surrounded by scandal and gossip. Sally promises to get her lost money back, and begins her investigation...<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jim Taylor's work at the theatre throws him into the path of the famous magician Alastair MacKinnon, who begs him for help in escaping two armed men. Jim takes him home, and he and Fred (who is experimenting with capturing seances with cameras) hear his extraordinary story. As well as an amazing talent on the stage, MacKinnon claims to have psychometry abilities - when he touches certain objects, he gains visions connected to them. And recently, he's had a vision of a man killing another with a sword in a snowy forest, and believes that the murderer knows that he knows, and has sent men to kill him.<br /><br />Filled with magicians, physics, beauties, blackmail, murder and intrigue, \\"The Shadow in the North\\" follows on nicely from its previous book, if not quite up to its ingenuity. \\"The Ruby in the Smoke\\" just seemed a bit more personal considering Sally's secretive past and her father's murder was involved, and here I couldn't get quite as involved in the story as previously. Despite a terrifying, fascinating villain and a nefarious plot, there were a couple of glitches, such as the unnecessary presence of a giant dog that Sally owns, and at one stage MacKinnon claiming to be related to two other characters - the problem is he isn't, making the passage rather confusing. What annoyed me most however, was the complete lack of Rosa and Trembler, two major characters in the first book who are completely absent here, and only barely mentioned. And these mentions are so brief that a swift reader might miss them completely, and they certainly don't give us satisfactory information on their present lives. Thankfully, they reappear in the next book \\"The Tiger in the Well,\\" and one has to admit that Philip Pullman is always more concerned with creating a story true to life rather than a formulaic system that is regurgitated every book.<br /><br />There are some passages that may raise some adult eyebrows, but I think some may blow these out of proportion. Yes, there is violence, death and premarital sex, but Pullman never goes out of his way to explictly describe any of these things. And this *is* classified as a \\"young adult\\" book - no one under the age of eleven is going to be reading this book, and anyone over that age is certainly capable of handling what Pullman presents.<br /><br />Although it's not my favourite book in the series, it's still a great read, and a necessary one if you're going to continue reading the Sally Lockhart books.

She was raised single handedly by her father, and now has begun her own investigation into his mysterious death at sea. Told that he drowned when his ship sank, Sally has reason to belief otherwise after receiving a strange note from her father with a jumble of words upon it, including \\"The Seven Blessings\\". At the beginning of this story she mentions this to one of her father's business partners, and watches as he dies of fear and shock at the words.<br /><br />So at the age of sixteen she's just killed a man, and yet this is only the start of her journey into the murky Victorian underworld to unravel the mystery surrounding her. As the author wonderfully puts it \\"Sally had shaken the edge of a web, and the spider at the heart of it had woken.\\" Moving throughout Philip Pullman's marvellously recreated world of Victorian London, with every twisting ally and misty harbour described in detail, Sally delves into a mystery involving opium, smuggling, blackmail, a secret in her past, and a huge dangerous ruby that more than a few people want to get their hands on.<br /><br />On the way, she gains several friends such as the cheeky Cockney lad Jim Taylor, and the handsome photographer Frederick Garland and his household/photography shop, which holds his feisty sister Rosa and the timid Trembler. Finding her place in this small family, Sally also comes up against her enemies, everything from the intoxicating scent of opium to the brutish Mr Berry to the loathsome and terrifying old Mrs Holland. And beyond all of this is a deeper enemy, responsible for the death of her father.<br /><br />Philip Pullman has written a wonderful thriller based on the type of Penny Dreadfuls and pulp novels that you would expect to find in the Victorian age, and it's very hard not to get wrapped up in the twisting plot and intriguing characters. His style of writing is just amazing, everything from the gloomy emptiness of Marshbank's house to the vitality of Garland's photography store just comes to life on the page. He knows just how to string a reader along from line to line, telling them just what they need to know to intrigue them without straight-out telling them how things fit together.<br /><br />And Sally is definitely a wonderful heroine. Without making her too good to be true, he's created a strong female lead that is understandably frustrated by the restrictions on women in her time, yet faces the odds in the best way she knows how. It's also difficult not to like Jim and Fred, and the way in which these three characters act with each other is beautifully portrayed.<br /><br />The four novels that contain these characters is just as intriguing as the stories themselves. Each one is a separate, complete story, and can even be read out of order, but it's somewhat difficult to see how they fit together. For instance, the first three books in the series (this one, \\"The Shadow in the North\\" and \\"The Tiger in the Well\\") all contain Sally as their protagonist. The forth one however \\"The Tin Princess\\", has Sally as a minor character whilst Jim takes over as the hero. One might be inclined to ignore this book, or consider it a `spin-off' of the first three, but it re-introduces a character that disappears in this first book, making it necessary reading. Likewise, to get the best out of \\"The Tiger in the Well\\" you definitely have to read \\"The Ruby in the Smoke\\" in order to get the full benefit from the revelation that comes from the unmasking of the villain. So it is an odd, somewhat disjointed set of books, but which are all connected together in subtle ways. Pullman is not afraid to kill off main characters, and is more concerned with making his stories feel like real life rather than having neat little happy endings. So start with \\"Ruby in the Smoke\\", and hopefully you'll want to keep reading.<br /><br />By the way, I read these books long before the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy was published, but if you're looking for more of Pullman's books along those fantasy lines then you won't find them here. These are quite different from his later works, but don't let that put you off - they are different, but still very good.py endings.

Ann Pilling, who also goes by the alias Ann Cheatham or Lillian Cheatham, is an author with a great interest in taking historical events and folk-legends and bringing them into the present day. She has done this for the two other books concerning Oliver, Colin and Prill, \\"Black Harvest\\" and \\"The Beggar's Curse\\" - with her three contemporary kids finding themselves caught up in the unquiet remnants of the past. In \\"The Witch of Lagg\\", the author again takes historical fact and reshapes it to fit her creepy supernatural story. In her afterword she recounts the facts concerning the death of Margaret Wilson, considered one of the most tragic martyrs in Scottish history. Found guilty of heresy, she was tied to a stake upon the shore and drowned by the oncoming tide.<br /><br />The author tinkers with this tale, and has her two siblings Colin and Prill (short for Priscilla) and their adopted cousin Oliver travel with their father and bossy aunt to Lagg Castle in Scotland, so that their father might paint a portrait of the owner Hugo Grierson. Also with them is their little sister Alison and their beloved Irish setter Jessie. It begins as the three children help fourteen year old Duncan Ross remove stones from a cottage cairn in order to rebuild a broken wall. Duncan and his father Angus have lived on the land all their lives, as have countless generations, but the relationship between themselves and their employer Mr Grierson is based on scorn, superiority and hatred. Both are as bad as each other, with Mr Grierson treating them as little more than dogs, whilst the Rosses fester in their own bitterness.<br /><br />But when they remove the stones and uncover the old well underneath, a malevolent force is realised into the valley. Accidents happen, Jessie becomes ill, Colin has a terrible headache, and horrible pranks are played by an unseen assailant. And yet despite this, often Prill feels a gentle, loving presence - almost holy in its innate sense of goodness. Whilst the tension between the Rosses and Grierson escalates, the three children explore the beautiful countryside for clues as to what's going on, finding bits and pieces of legends and relics that point to a long-ago crime which still lingers in Lagg.<br /><br />Pilling, or Cheatham, or whatever you'd like to call her, is a master at spooky atmospheres and a foreboding sense of evil. Just as horror movies are always more scary when the terrors are left up to your imagination, Pilling carefully displays the unnaturalness of the situations without telling us exacting what's happening. This is put to best effect when aunt Phyllis is babysitting Alison and is targeted by the malevolent presence. There's only so much you can blame on a toddler. Her style however, is often a little confusing. Although it's not so much the case in this book, she sometimes leaves too much to the imagination, as often it's difficult to really grasp what's going on. As I said, it's not so apparent in \\"The Witch of Lagg\\", she ends up spelling things out pretty clearly, but the story in which she uses this technique the most (\\"The Beggar's Curse\\") is in fact the best one.<br /><br />Also of note is the wonderful character that Pilling creates in Oliver. He's annoying, shrimpy, whiny and somewhat snivelling - yet Pilling infuses him with an insightfulness and intelligence that makes him endlessly fascinating. As she puts it, he doesn't just see things, but beyond things, and in all three books is always the first to figure out what's going on. He's a great creation, and as nice as Colin and Prill are, they aren't half as interesting as Oliver is. His adoptive mother Phyllis is an amusing stereotype of a bossy matriarch (who actually pours the children's' milk on their cereal for them) and the opposing forces in the story are vividly created as they push up against each other.<br /><br />A word of warning though, for any New-Age or practicing Wiccan/witch - this book uses the medieval concept of a witchin the course of the story; defined by evil powers and links to the devil, all of which can get a little scary at times (ie the church itself is attacked). Just so you know.<br /><br />This commentary on good and evil is another recommendation for the book, especially in humanity's inability to forgive and forget, even several generations later, and the need for many of us to simply let go of any hate we might carry. \\"The Witch of Lagg\\" is a reasonably short novel, but an interesting one and a good place to start if you want to try out Pilling's unique ideas and style. Try also the afore mentioned \\"Black Harvest\\" and \\"The Beggar's Curse\\" also featuring Oliver, Colin and Prill, as well as \\"The Empty Frame\\", which uses different children but nevertheless is remarkably similar in content to the other three books.f a witch in the course of the story; defined by evil powers and links to the devil, all of which can get a little scary at times (ie the church itself is attacked).

If however, you are under fifteen, then \\"Chinese Cinderella\\" makes for an easier read whilst still keeping the amazing experience of the author's life intact. Told in first person narrative, \\"Chinese Cinderella\\" recounts the author's extraordinary childhood as an unwanted daughter.<br /><br />Adeline Yen/Wu Mei (\\"Fifth Younger Sister\\"), never knew her mother, as she died soon after her birth. Because of this, she was deemed unlucky, and all photos of her mother were destroyed. Despite her wonderful academic talents which constantly keep her at the top of the class, her family constantly ignored or tormented her - she was bullied by her older brothers, spurned by her elder sister, ignored by her father and beaten by her stepmother Niang. Yet for all of this, each member of her family is presented as a real person, capable of both good and evil, and Adeline records their rare moments of kindness like they were precious gems. Her two sources of constant affection was her aunt Baba, an unmarried woman dependant on Adeline's father and stepmother for financial support, and her grandfather caught between two worlds: the old traditions when a man his age wielded respect, and the new mindset which saw him as a burden and the object of harmful pranks by his grandson.<br /><br />Adeline records her entire childhood, through several schools and houses, through the people she meets and one very special duckling pet - Precious Little Treasure (or PLT for short) that she cares for. She records her sister's wedding, her school friends, and her on-going quest for knowledge, and most surreal of all, her time at a convent in Tianjin that slowly empties, leaving her the only student left in the entire school. As well as this, Adeline explains the political upheaval and historical backdrop of her life in hindsight, something she obviously didn't understand as a child.<br /><br />Throughout the sad and often terrible story of her life, Adeline's narrative never once slips into whines or self-pity - everything is presented in such a simple, matter of fact manner that we never feel pity for her - only profound sorrow and sympathy. Her determination and dignity is amazing to behold, from her refusal to take money for the tram (even though her elder siblings soon give in) to her diligent studies and scholarship. Furthermore, she beautifully brings her childhood feelings to life; especially in regard to the deep sense of fear that all abused children carry. Although older readers know that nothing truly harmful would be allowed to happen to Adeline, the imagination and terror that a child's mind can invoke made me just as fearful of Niang as she was. People often believe that abused children are indignant and outspoken about their home troubles, but Adeline clearly shows us that this is almost never the case - she is ashamed and secretive of her home life, and unfortunately the desire to keep their troubles hidden from their friends is the fate of most such children.<br /><br />The power of knowledge and perseverance is the theme at the forefront of this book: unlike the Western Cinderella who sat around crying for her fairy godmother, the Chinese Cinderella Ye Xian worked for her good fortune and so does Adeline herself. It is humbling to read of a girl so desperate for learning and education when we acquire it so easily but often don't appreciate it. Adeline pours her heart and soul in her books, and often reflects on her love of reading, with passages that any book-lover will immediately understand, and any reluctant reader will hopefully take into account.<br /><br />Never once does she appear for feel overly sorry for herself, despite the unfair way in which she was treated. Rather than the cruel pranks and physical harm she suffers, it is the smaller, more poignant events that come across as moretragic: people forgetting to pick her up from school, letters being prevented from reaching her, her family neglecting to tell her that her grandfather had died, the awful clothing she's forced to wear, and most shocking of all, her father forgetting her name. The fact that Adeline makes it through all of this to become a stable and loving person is perhaps the biggest miracle of all. What a human being!<br /><br />The book also contains a preface, an author's note on the names and languages used, a map of China, an historical note, some fascinating photographs of the family members, and a dedication \\"to all unwanted children.\\" Everyone, boy or girl, young or old, should be made to read this book.oss as more tragic: people forgetting to pick her up from school, letters being prevented from reaching her, her family neglecting to tell her that her grandfather had died, the awful clothing she's forced to wear, and most shocking of all, her father forgetting her name.

It reads like a fleshed-out fairytale, and contains much of the imagery and themes associated with such stories - everything from the persecuted younger brother to the quest narrative to the malevolent ruler of the land to the magical helpers and objects. For this reason, the story may sound rather predictable (and often it is), but as Russian folktales are not often delved into by Western writers, it is worth tracking down for a read.<br /><br />Ivan is the youngest son of Tsar Demyan, and bullied by his two elder brothers, the brutal Yuri and the sly Igor. Tsar Demyan has the greatest garden in all the world, the centrepiece of which is the apple tree from Avalon on which grows a single golden apple. This apple is said to give the one who eats it immortal life, and so naturally the tsar has it guarded day and night. One day however Ivan is walking in the gardens and spots the beautiful sight of the Firebird - devouring the golden apple.<br /><br />Fearful of his father's wrath, he takes a feather left behind by the bird to the tsar and explains the situation. The tsar is immediately obsessed with the bird, and orders his three sons to fetch it - promising the kingdom to the one who brings it back. The three set off, with Ivan determined not to let his evil brothers claim the beautiful bird before hand. A love interest is thrown in for good measure, Princess Tamara, whom Ivan loves but who is betrothed to Yuri. By finding the Firebird, he hopes that he can free Tamara from this dreadful fate.<br /><br />The journey makes up the bulk of the book, and is brought to life with amazing characters and vivid imagery of forest and desert lands. However, the story itself is quite a tangled lot of threads that aren't always tied together. Several times there are characters and situations introduced which - though interesting - have no real bearing on the completion of the story. Likewise, there are a couple of characters who go about in disguise, but their \\"unmasking\\" is often rather confusing - in one case a person's real identity is attributed to two totally different characters.<br /><br />It often falls to several fairytale cliches; obviously this will be the case if the book is a fleshed out fairytale, but the way in which this is presented is not done in a particular original or creative way. For instance, an innkeeper's wife gives Ivan a flute. Why? Because she can see he has a \\"good heart\\". This in itself is rather silly - what makes it worse it that the flute has no real purpose in the course of the story. If you're going to use fairytale elements, they need to make sense within the course of the story.<br /><br />So why should you bother with this book? There is something about Sophie Masson's wonderful poetic prose and the charisma she displays on every page that is appealing. The characters are well drawn, the settings are beautiful, and she melds several cultures together to make a whole - the afore mentioned Celtic Avalon, the Greek legends of Medea, the Russian Firebird and even a retelling of the French myth of Melusine.<br /><br />Plus I've always had a bit of a thing for the mythological Firebird/phoenix (my favourite character in \\"Harry Potter\\" is Fawkes the phoenix). Sophie Masson is a great author, and although this isn't her best work, it's still an enjoyable read.no real bearing on the completion of the story.

Michael is living in a stage of upheaval and transition in his life: his parents have just moved to a rather derelict house, his unnamed baby sister is drastically ill, and the house is often visited by `Doctor Death', the doctor sent to check up on his sister. On top of this, he now has to bus for school; the previous occupant of the house was dead for a week before anyone found him, and the outside garden is a wilderness. The garage in particular is a nightmare - slumping over, filled with junk and dead creatures, and liable to fall over any second. But Michael decides to have a peek inside, and finds an amazing discovery...<br /><br />What is the strange creature hidden beneath the cobwebs and the dead flies? Is it a human, a bird or something else entirely? Calling itself Skellig, the strange being seems near death, and Michael longs to help it, feeling that in some strange way its fate is wrapped up with the fate of his baby sister. He befriends the girl living next door, Mina, who does not attend school due to her mother's belief that school stifles children's creativity, and soon the two have plans to move Skellig to the house across the road which is inhabited only by birds.<br /><br />As his baby sister deteriorates and the family is thrown into worry and turmoil, Skellig begins to make progress, leading Michael once more to the question - what exactly is this strange creature, and can he do something -anything - to help the baby?<br /><br />It is a rare book that can tell what seems to be such a simple story in such a clear, yet intoxicating way. Told in first-person narrative by Michael, David Almond effortlessly creates the point of view of a young boy in a gritty, realistic world. The language and behaviour in particular is wonderful - you can really see real people speaking and acting in the ways that he describes, and the interaction with Skellig is so natural that you have no trouble believing Michael's words.<br /><br />On reading it for the second time, I also realised that not a single word is wasted in the telling of this tale - every single one serves a purpose in connecting the ideas and themes that Almond shapes together. From evolution and science to faith and miracles, to blackbirds and owls, to love and friendship - each are closely entwined together to make a complete whole. Such a complex melding of ideas and possibilities told in such an impossibly simple way, a complete lack of sophistication and yet so much depth and meaning is not something you'll find in just any children's book. I say again: not a single word is wasted.<br /><br />Sad and joyful, poignant and funny, thought provoking and mysterious - the only book that I could possibly compare it to is \\"The Owl Service\\" by Alan Garner. The two authors seem to have the same style and techniques - telling the reader only what they need to know and letting them discover the rest for themselves. And what is discovered are endless possibilities for humanity, life - and yes, even death. The winner of both the Whitbread Children's Book of the Year and the Carnegie Medal certainly counts for something, and this deceptively slim novel certainly deserves more than one read and a permanent place on the bookshelf.e second time, I also realised that not a single word is wasted in the telling of this tale - every single one serves a purpose in connecting the ideas and themes that Almond shapes together.

US	39424751	R3RHY04TG1M0UU	0553153277	444133547	Anne of Green Gables	Books	5	1	1	N	N	"I'd Rather Have You Than A Dozen Boys, Anne..."	The world of children's literature is packed full of orphans: Harry Potter, Mary Lennox, Oliver Twist, Pollyanna... Standing tall amongst this group is Anne Shirley, a freckled, imaginative, talkative redhead that was supposed to be a boy. Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, two old unmarried siblings, have decided to adopt a young boy to help out on their farmland. But when intensely shy Matthew reaches the train station he is somewhat horrified to find that their expected boy is in fact a girl. Seeing nothing that can be done at that moment, Matthew takes her home to Green Gables in Avonlea, finding the eleven-year-old fascinating company on the way. Despite Marilla's shock at the mistake, the Cuthberts decide that for better or worse, Anne should remain with them at Green Gables.<br /><br />And so Anne's upbringing by the two most unlikely parents begins. Matthew is happy to remain in the background, doting on Anne and interfering with Marilla's techniques only when he feels particularly strongly about something, and so it falls to Marilla to do most of the work. Marilla is a woman who has never had much experience in displaying any type of love, but soon finds her long-dormant sense of humour being awoken by the vivacious, dreamy, loving child. Anne herself is a character that it's difficult not to fall in love with - passionate, mischievous, dreamy, a chatterbox, determined and with a streak of innate goodness that puts her just a little lower than the angels. She is one of the most memorable and well-loved characters of all time, and if you have not yet discovered this amazing personality and \\"kindred spirit\\", then it's about time you got hold of the first installment of her life \\"Anne of Green Gables\\".<br /><br />Anne Shirley went on to star in many other books, but most will agree that this first one is far and away the best. Beginning with the twisting and intricate curves of a running stream, and ending with the calm and stable (yet still interesting) road, it chronicles the first five years of Anne's life at Green Gables as she steadily grows from a wild and unruly girl to a poised and intelligent young woman. Most of the characters here pop up again in other books, and are instantly as lovable and memorable as Anne herself.<br /><br />First of course are Matthew and Marilla, two rather lonely people who find their lives brightened immeasurably once Anne becomes a part of their family. There is Diana, Anne's somewhat unimaginative, but devoted best friend, and Gilbert Blythe, the boy who makes the mistake of making fun of Anne's hair and so bears the full brunt of her wrath and ongoing grudge. Mrs Rachel Lynde, the kind-hearted busybody who lives next door and Anne's beloved teacher and the minister's wife: Miss Stacey and Mrs Allen. As well as this is a host of other minor characters, all interesting and real in their own way, from schoolyard friends to family relatives to community figures: each one is  a tiny gem of characterisation.<br /><br />But Anne herself is the star of the show from start to finish - so talkative is she that often Montgomery forsakes describing first-hand the things she gets up to and instead lets Anne herself describe them in hindsight (usually to Marilla). It's a tricky technique to use, but Anne is so exuberant and descriptive in her conversations that it works remarkably well. She has her moments however - like the time she tried to dye her hair black and it ended up green. Or the time she used liniment in a cake instead of vanilla. Or the time she accidentally got her best friend drunk. But half the fun of the book is finding out just what she'll get up to next, so I won't spoil it all for you.<br /><br />Part of the charm (by this stage) is that, like Jane Austen, L. M. Montgomery was a contemporary writer in the 1920's - not a modern day author writing about a time period that they didn't belong to. Therefore, the world of 1920's Prince Edward Island is brought to vivid life, knowing thatthis woman actually lived there at this time. There are phrases and words that mean nothing to modern day readers, but add to the book's authenticity and charm, as well as its innocence and the feel that it belongs to a younger, more golden time.  Yet despite this, some things always stay the same: boys still make fun of the girls they like, children still find trends and hobbies at school all important, dares are still being made and met, the older generation still thinks the younger one is out of control, and people still behave and react to each other in the same way they do today. For some reason, I find this extremely comforting.<br /><br />Montgomery also has an ear for poetry and prose, and her descriptions of Avonlea in all its naturalistic beauty is stunningly beautiful, and only occasionally a bit trite. Anne's imagination and habit for naming things only adds to its richness, and Montgomery creates a tapestry of colours, hues, reflections and atmosphere. On top of this, she has a wonderful sense of humour and often adds the most hilarious scenarios into the story.<br /><br />Out of everything though, is the beautifully touching relationship between Marilla, Matthew and Anne, so natural and loving that it often brings a tear to my eye. Marilla's criticisms and rules make perfect sense when Montgomery informs us that the old woman feels rather suspicious of her loving feelings toward Anne, and Matthews devotion to her is summed up best by Marilla: \\"Matthew would think it all right, Anne, if you took a notion to get up and have dinner in the middle of the night.\\" And of course, Anne herself, which I'm sure I've mentioned before - her sunny attitude, her faith in mankind, her extreme temperament... you really need to meet this girl.knowing that this woman actually lived there at this time.

The second two just don't seem to have the same characterisation or sense of all the plot threads drawing together in a master plan like \\"Running\\" did. But if you're determined to see Nest and Ross's story out to the end, then here we go again...<br /><br />John Ross is a knight working on behalf of the Word who has managed to capture a strange magical creature - a gypsy morph that is made of leftover magics and (because of its capacity for either good or evil) is a much coveted prize for both sides of the battle. It has finally settled on the shape of a young boy, and since then the only word it has uttered has been the name \\"Nest\\".<br /><br />Nest is now twenty-nine years old, a divorcee, and a retired Olympian runner - in other words, she's not really feeling fulfilled in her life, especially due to the unwanted attentions of the local sheriff Larry Spence. Then two arrivals appear: a demon named Findo Gask shows up on her doorstep inquiring after John Ross, and Bennett Scott, the young woman that Nest once saved, who is now a drug addict with a daughter of her own - Harper. Eventually John himself arrives, complete with the morph/boy they dub \\"Little John\\".<br /><br />In the three days before Christmas, Nest and Ross come together again, trying to solve the riddle of the gypsy morph whilst shielding it from the control of Gask and his trio of demon henchmen. This mission is especially important to Ross due to the promise that the Lady has given him: if he completes this task, then his service as a Knight will be over.<br /><br />The setting is thankfully back in Hopewell and the park, and Pick the sylvan is given more to do in this book than in the last, as does Wraith, Nest's inner guardian in the form of a giant wolfhound. The return of Bennett is a nice touch, if a little sad, Robert Heppler is still around - now with a wife and child of his own, and Two Bears again has a cameo appearance - perhaps the best one of the three books. Larry Spence is rather irritating, though I suppose he was supposed to be - but by the end of the novel I felt rather sorry for his kids - Brooks does nothing to explain what will now happen to them. Findo Gask makes a scary villain, calm, organised and collected in the visage of a country preacher with a Book of Names on all the people he has killed, and is backed up nicely by the slightly crazed Penny Dreadful. However, the other two demons' presence is somewhat unnecessary - the ur'droch remains an enigma, and Twitch's existence is entirely unjustified (he doesn't do anything except back up an unfortunate stereotype against albinos - they don't have pink eyes!)<br /><br />The story itself suffers too - although the premise is interesting, there are plot holes and inconsistencies large enough to drive a truck through, plus an awkwardness in reconciling the fantasy and the `real world' stories that wasn't present in the previous books. The plot seems somewhat cobbled together quickly, switching back and forth between scenarios that don't really fit together - the demons' actions and motivations in particular are somewhat confusing, choosing elaborate schemes and disguises to watch the protagonists instead of simply going in and getting what they want. For evil creatures, they fluff around an awful lot, and spend too much time manipulating Larry Spence and Bennett when there isn't really much reason to. Likewise, the characterisations of Ross and Nest suffer too - even knowing what's at cost, they make some extremely unwise decisions. I question Nest's very intelligence at leaving Bennett and Harper alone in the house on the same day a demon came to call, and later letting Bennett go out alone after a near fatal accident. Furthermore, they don't neglect their social lives during the life or death situation - Nest goes to a Christmas party and Ross visits an old flame, seemingly believing that they'll be safe amongst other people when its been shown again and again that this is never the case. With Gask waiting too long to make his move, Nest waiting too long to ask for a basic warding spell around her house, and a lot of time wasted on a lengthy and unnecessary death scene on a frozen lake, the story just felt to patchy and hacked together.<br /><br />Which is unfortunate given that it's the last book - some people may feel a little short-changed at the resolution, though it does end on a conclusion that suggests more books might be coming; Brooks certainly leaves himself with enough material to keep the franchise open, and I myself would dearly love to see Nest's old friend Brianna and Jared once again. As \\"Knight\\" centred on the theme of homelessness, here Brooks explores the evils of drug abuse. Thankfully the message was not so heavy handed as it was in the previous book, but it still comes across loud and clear: Don't Do Drugs.<br /><br />All in all, a reasonable end to an interesting trilogy, but it always felt as though Brooks was skimming the surface of something much larger and more intricate that was only really explored in \\"Running with the Demon\\".on to.

As \\"Knight\\" centred on the theme of homelessness, here Brooks explores the evils of drug abuse. Thankfully the message was not so heavy handed as it was in the previous book, but it still comes across loud and clear: Don't Do Drugs. <br /> <br />All in all, a reasonable end to an interesting trilogy, but it always felt as though Brooks was skimming the surface of something much larger and more intricate that was only really explored in \\"Running with the Demon\\".  <br />	2004-09-28

In the previous two books \\"Ilse Witch\\" and \\"Antrax\\" the Druid Walker led a range of characters to the faraway island of Parkasia in order to find a great treasure trove of ancient knowledge. Stalked by the Ilse Witch and then attacked by the archaic machinery of the Antrax, the crew found themselves utterly divided. Walker has been fatally wounded by the Antrax after unsuccessfully attempting to gain this treasure, but now bids Bek to save the one thing that they can salvage from the mission: the Ilse Witch.<br /><br />Bek Ohmsford and the mysterious shape-shifter Truls Rokh are attempting to convince the Ilse Witch that she is not only Bek's sister Grianne Ohmsford, but that her mentor the Morgawr was the one that killed her parents - not Walker as she had been led to believe. After the truth is revealed to her by the magic of the Sword of Shannara, she slips into a state of catatonia that Bek cannot awaken her from. Meanwhile, the elf prince Ahren Elessedil and the seer Ryer Ord Star have retrieved the long-lost Elfstones only to find themselves captured by the Morgawr who seeks to use them in the attempt to trap the rest of the crew.<br /><br />Everyone else is engaged in fairly dull activities: Quentin Leah does a lot of walking, and Rue Meridian, her brother Redder Alt Mer and the Wing Rider Hunter Predd take control of \\"Black Moclips\\" only to abandon it in a storm - a needless and pointless plot line. Panax's presence in the story is still a mystery. With the Antrax gone and the Ilse Witch converted, the story basically follows the surviving members of the crew trying to find one another, flee the island and avoid the Morgawr and his crew of reptilian Mwellrets.<br /><br />The problem with this is that for all intents and purposes, the voyage is over. They came, they looked for the treasure, they didn't actually get the treasure (making the whole trip fairly pointless) and now they're leaving again. There is no sense of moving forward, only going back, and as such it's less interesting. To make things worse, the Morgawr is a rather humdrum bad guy, with nothing of the Ilse Witch's mystery or the Antrax's incorporeal threat. This is just a bad guy that wants to kill the goodies, because that's what bad guys do.<br /><br />There are more problems: the love story between Bek and Rue is forced and unconvincing, there are more pointless encounters (including a man-eating plant) and it ends on a silly \\"here we go again\\" note.  There are endless sermons on the nature of love and loyalty, and often the long-winded dialogue that Brooks gives his characters is painfully unnatural and often repetitive: \\"They fly no flag, and their crews act like dead men...the ones he could see were men, but they didn't act like men. They acted like machines. They didn't look as if they were alive. They were all still and empty-eyed.\\" This sentence could be boiled down to half this length, without making the speaker sound like a robot and the reader like an idiot that has to have the situation pounded into him a number of times.<br /><br />Neither Ryer nor Truls is given a satisfactory send-off, and the conclusion of the story screams \\"sequels are coming!\\" And in fact they are - Brooks continues his story in a new trilogy called \\"The High Druid\\". The fact that the treasure itself ended up being inaccessible and the mission switched instead to Grianne, makes the entire thing seem like one big introduction to this next series of books.<br /><br />It was a promising start, and an interesting middle, but this final book is only worth reading in order to finish what you started --and see if Brooks can bring himself to let just one Elf Hunter (ie, nameless extra crew-member) to survive.

US	39424751	R3IE2MFXHUBE0Z	0345397673	106893307	Antrax (The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara)	Books	3	5	8	N	N	"Death Steals Away All Our Chances..."	\\"Antrax\\" (not to be confused with Anthrax, the nasty white powder) is the second book in the \\"Voyage of the Jerle Shannara\\" trilogy, dealing with the second great foe that the intrepid crew of the \\"Jerle Shannara\\" face. It's also possibly the best of the three books, though as usual suffers from several fantasy cliches, dull characters and predictable situations. Within this trilogy, it seems to me that with the exception of Walker, the antagonists are the main characters - each book is named after one of them, and are certainly a lot less bland than the good guys who spend most of this book on adventures that have little purpose in the overall context of the book, or running around like headless chickens. The archaic super-computer that has long-planned the \\"Jerle Shannara's\\" capture and defeat is certainly the star of this book.<br /><br />In the previous novel \\"Ilse Witch\\" the Druid Walker brought together a crew on board a flying airship and set off to discover a treasure of knowledge on a faraway island that is said to belong to the Old World. The way was chartered on a map found on a half-dead elf prince, but it is half way to the island that Walker begins to suspect that their entire voyage has been a carefully plotted trap planned out by the great evil awaiting them. To add to the danger, the crew is being pursued by the dreaded Ilse Witch and her untrustworthy ally the Morgawr, who are also out to seize the treasure and destroy the ship.<br /><br />After reaching the keep of Castledown, the crew is suddenly and violently separated after the Antrax activates its first weapon - threads of scorching fire. With the Antrax attempting to capture those that have magic, and destroy those that are of no use to it, the company is soon scattered -<br /><br />Our hero Bek Ohmsford and his protector Truks Rohk are attempting to convince the Ilse Witch that she is in fact Grianne Ohmsford, and that Bek is her brother, whilst simultaneously moving through a strange and unwelcoming land. Walker has gone into the depths of Castledown to find the sought-for books of knowledge that come out of the Old World, whilst the seer Ryer Ord Star and elfin Prince Ahren Elessedil follow; she to rescue Walker, and he to retrieve the lost Elfstones.<br /><br />Quentin Leah and an elfin tracker named Tamis (she has no last name, so you can tell she's a goner) come up against the robot-zombie figure of their former comrade Ard Patrinell (yes, you read that right, I said robot-zombie). Meanwhile, back on the ship Redder Alt Mer, his sister Rue Meridian and the Wing Rider Hunter Predd attempt to take back the invaded \\"Jerle Shannara\\" and then go after the Ilse Witch's own vessel \\"Black Moclips\\".<br /><br />I mentioned these two story plots together simply because they are utterly unimportant to the continuation and completion of the overall story - they come across as padding to make the book a bit thicker. Rue's story in particular has no real meaning - she single-handedly takes \\"Black Moclips,\\" neither learns nor gains anything of value, and then abandons ship once it heads into a storm. What was the point?! Likewise, the Ilse Witch creates a wolf-like magical creature which had no real purpose, and I'm still wondering why Panax the dwarf decided to come on the trip - he hasn't done anything yet!<br /><br />There are long-winded paragraphs on the island's locals, the character's internal struggles (they're conflicted, we get it) and Brooks is the master at speeches that become so lengthy that they're funny. Consider this: \\"Your face is not who you are. You might appear a monster, but you're not. You're my friend. You saved my life. But you wouldn't trust me with the truth about yourself. You hid that truth because you deceived yourself into thinking that it was something else. I would rather know you this way, terrible though it is, than have the truth hidden.\\" People just *do not* talk like this, and every time a character launches into one of thesedeclarations, it is a cause for laughter - and that's not a good thing.<br /><br />Ultimately the very purpose of the voyage is made null and void, with the discovery that the books of knowledge cannot be accessed - they belong on technological disks that Walker cannot understand. Despite this, I wondered at the possibility of him drawing them out mentally/magically, and then passing them on to the Ilse Witch...but no. When he says that Grianne is the new purpose of the mission it's not because she now carries the ancient knowledge, it's because...actually, we have to read Brook's *next* trilogy \\"The High Druid\\" to find out what. Sigh - aren't you glad Brooks has grasped the basics of milking a story for all it's worth?<br /><br />The Antrax is probably the most interesting part of the book, though your liking of it will depend on whether or not you appreciate the presence of technological remnants in an otherwise entirely fantasy-oriented world. I found that I didn't mind it too much, and although Brooks is frustratingly hazy on what the original purpose of the Antrax *was*, pitting his characters against an incorporeal and virtually unstoppable machine is rather compelling.<br /><br />I'm being *very* kind when I give this book three stars, especially since the final book in the trilogy \\"Morgawr\\" is quite awful. As it stands though, Brooks deserves credit for finally drawing away from writing Tolkien-clones (though he's still copying from his own previous work), and for adding a few splashes of good ideas and originality into this particular book.one of these declarations, it is a cause for laughter - and that's not a good thing. <br /> <br />Ultimately the very purpose of the voyage is made null and void, with the discovery that the books of knowledge cannot be accessed - they belong on technological disks that Walker cannot understand.

Characters are one-dimensional, suspense is non-existence, questions raised go unanswered, and the story itself is packed full of endless episodes that go no where and lend nothing to the flimsy plot.<br /><br />It's summer in Winthrop, Massachusetts and four teenagers are settling into a hot and humid break. They are Jeffrey Thomas, his girlfriend Barbara, his best friend Paul, and other close friend Miranda. Winthrop is your average seaside town, but a new arrival stirs things up: Rebecca Webster, a very beautiful young woman who seems to have an intent interest in Jeffrey. Soon weird things are going on: your usual nasty accidents, odd dreams, weird animals and abnormal behaviour from our main characters. Jeffrey in particular is effected by Rebecca's presence, and it doesn't help that his awe-struck girlfriend is dressing exactly like her.<br /><br />So what's the deal with Rebecca? What does she want with Jeffrey? The answers won't be found in this book - you'll have to spend more money in order to get the second book, which has the even more ridiculous name \\"Dreams of Revenge\\". There is absolutely no reason why this slim volume should be split into two books, except - of course! - it makes you spend more money this way!<br /><br />The author ends chapters like R. L. Stine's \\"Goosebumps\\" books - with dramatic, gasp-inducing shocks...only for the beginning of the next chapter to take place several days later, telling us in hindsight what really happened. For instance, a teenager in the diner begins to choke on her food, and we end with \\"Silently, Vicki slipped off her chair to the floor\\". The next chapter begins a week later, with characters commenting on the strange occurrence, saying simply: \\"Thank goodness she was alright\\", without any explanation on how she was saved. The entire narrative is riddled with these cliched `suspense' moments that have no real purpose in the over all story, and aren't scary enough themselves to merit their presence. Almost every chapter ends with one of these attempts at shock, and eventually they just get silly - from \\"then there was only darkness,\\" to \\"then, mercifully, a velvet darkness enveloped him as he lost consciousness\\" to the ludicrous \\"Rebecca didn't have a telephone.\\" Horrors!<br /><br />Finally, the forced `love' story between Jeffrey and Rebecca is unlikely (based entirely on the effect she has on him, which the reader can hardly experience or understand for themselves) as well as repetitive - she draws him in, she pushes him away, she draws him in, she pushes him away - you get the picture.<br /><br />Definitely give this particular teen-read a wide berth.ative is riddled with these cliched `suspense' moments that have no real purpose in the over all story, and aren't scary enough themselves to merit their presence.

The description at the back of the book is naturally misleading - it trills that \\"Brooks set the new standard for the genre with his astounding first novel\\" and that now \\"he embarks on what promises to be his masterpiece.\\" Gimme a break! This is a lightweight fantasy book, not high epic literature. Thankfully, this book is probably the first book that doesn't bear such an obvious similarity to \\"Lord of the Rings\\", though there are echoes galore from Tolkien's master-work. His world of the Four Lands has been the setting for his previous books, and now a range of characters sets off over the Blue Divide (the ocean) on a quest that isn't solely about destroying evil - the reasons for it are more personal and political.<br /><br />\\"The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara\\" is the first of a trilogy, and this particular volume is called \\"Ilse Witch\\" (each book is named after a villain). It is set about one hundred and fifty years after the events of the quartet \\"Heritage of Shannara\\", and its last remaining character Walker remains in the Druid Keep of Paranor, nursing his dream of creating an independent Druid Council to exist and interact in the Four Lands. This dream is about to be stirred up once more with the discovery of an Elf floating in the ocean by a Wing Rider named Hunter Predd. He is wearing a bracelet and carries a map - a map that shows the way to an island where a great power is said to reside.<br /><br />Walker is determined to set out and fetch this great treasure regardless of the risks, and goes about bringing together a crew. This takes up nearly half of the book, and is the most dull and sluggish part of the story, especially since all his characters bear uncanny resemblances to past characters in his books. Bek Rowe (like Shea and Par Ohmsford before him) is your standard `Luke Skywalker' figure, who remains utterly dull throughout the book. As usual, someone from the Leah family is present - in this case Bek's cousin Quentin, whose presence is so minimal it doesn't warrant his inclusion in the story. Throw in some Rovers - brother and sister team Redder Alt Mer and Rue Meridian - who are given a lengthy introduction and then ignored completely, and a `shadow' character - Truls Rokh, a mysterious being that hides behind a dense cloak. Someone from the Elessedil family is always necessary - in this case Ahren Elessedil, the younger brother of the new king who is seeking to prove himself, and a seer named Ryer Ord Star who helps out by making cryptic prophesies. Finally, there is the dwarf Panax, another character who has no visible purpose, three Wing Riders including Hunter Predd. and Walker himself to lead the voyage.<br /><br />Once the airship \\"Jerle Shannara\\" sets off, Walker explains what the map implies - that to reach the island of Ice Henge and the city of Castledown they must first visit three islands in order to get three keys that will unlock their way. This in itself is a rather dull idea - the ship formulaically reaches the three islands, the crew looses unnamed (and therefore unimportant) personnel that Brooks uses as cannon-fodder, and Walker gains the key. This particular element of killing off various members of elf-security just to show the reader how dangerous the situation is especially annoying. Take also for example the three Wing Riders - they listed as Hunter Predd,  Po Kelles and Gill. Guess which one dies. That's right, the one that's not important enough to have a last name. On the topic of names, another thing annoys me - even toward the end of the book he's still calling his characters by their full names. That is, instead of simply `Rue', he continually writes `Rue Meridian'. Instead of just `Ryer' it's always 'Ryer Ord Star'. Why he insists on doing this is beyond me, but it's very irritating.<br /><br />Behind the ship continually lurks the sinister Ilse Witch, who despises Walker and seeks to sabotage the mission, kill Walker and claim the prize that awaits. But she has a connectionto one of the people on board the \\"Jerle Shannara\\", someone who has been brought in the hope that she can be persuaded back to her former life. In turn, she is being watched by her mentor the Morgawr, and all parties are heading towards yet another evil - the being that awaits them in Castledown.<br /><br />There is a touch more science-fiction in this installment, which doesn't really impinge on the fantasy elements of the story, but also don't really need to be in the story at all. Why do we need airships - great vessels that fly in the air? What's wrong with average ships, especially since most of the action takes place at sea? Brooks has mentioned in previous books the distant past that is hinted at being technologically advanced, and here explores this idea a bit more fully. The characters are rather one-dimensional, but the quest itself (despite its slow-going) has a tantalising mystery to it that warrants your attention.<br /><br />As you may have expected, it ends on a cliff-hanger, which means you'll need the second part \\"Antrax\\" on hand to find out what happens. As far as `Shannara' novels go, this one is adequate. Although very slow to start, and then stuck with your standard `reach island, avoid dangers, get the key' plot device, the ideas, intrigue and suspense does keep you interested enough to push on with reading it.to one of the people on board the \\"Jerle Shannara\\", someone who has been brought in the hope that she can be persuaded back to her former life.

But I would think most pre-teens would know better than to waste their time with such a cliched, silly set of books.<br /><br />\\"Kiss of Death\\" told of a beautiful woman named Rebecca Webster, who came out of the blue into Winthrop, Massachusetts and fixed her attentions onto a young man named Jeffrey Thomas, who seemed unable to resist her charms despite having a devoted girlfriend. But now, after a boating accident Barbara has died, and the way to Rebecca seems open to him. But she has her own agenda, and instead seems to want to simply torment him with her elusive presence.<br /><br />Bored yet? \\"Dreams of Revenge\\" is marginally better than the first half mostly because it actually seems to have a plot - not just a random sequence of `spooky' events, but is still filled with dull characters, forced dialogue, dangling plot threads, and an inconceivable premise that is as baffling as it is silly. Rebecca, you see, is soon revealed to be the Rebecca Webster that was hung as a witch in Salem. Now she has apparently come back from the end to extract revenge from the descendant of the judge that saw her killed. I say `apparently' because the author gives no explanation as to how she managed to come back, what she actually is (a ghost? A reincarnation? A time traveller?)  or why she thinks she's justified in killing Judge Thomas's descendant. Why didn't she just go after the judge? For that matter, why is it specifically Jeffrey who is her target - did she ever go after Jeffrey's father? Or his grandfather? None of the details concerning her life, or afterlife are properly explained or explored, and all the strange occurrences that took place in the first book and assumed to be the work of Rebecca are never touched on again. So how did she create the nightmares, the gruesome animals, her irresistible nature, and the odd weather...? How can she disappear into thin air, and why does she never eat? Why do plants wither around her and where was she between her death and her reappearance in Winthrop? How does she buy the old house she lives in? Why am I even asking these questions?<br /><br />The `love' story of the first half was made up of Rebecca luring Jeffrey, then pushing him away, over and over again. Now it's changed to her being openly loving toward him, then running away, loving him, then running away. Over and over again. The girl is so obviously out of her mind, that one wonders why on earth Jeffrey puts up with her - especially so soon after his girlfriend's death.<br /><br />Finally, the ending is so utterly unsatisfactory that readers will be frustrated and angry - I'm not even sure it could be called an `ending', it's just...a stop. None of the ideas or narratives are brought to a conclusion that makes sense, instead stopping at a place that offers no closure or explanations whatsoever. Please, give this book, and its predecessor a miss. They don't even qualify for my entertaining-but-negligible holiday read category.did she create the nightmares, the gruesome animals, her irresistible nature, and the odd weather...?

Smith's \\"Secret Circle\\" trilogy, and I would strongly advise not reading it until you have read the two previous novels \\"The Initiation\\" and \\"The Captive\\". Yes, it's annoying trying to track down two books that belong to the same story (in my opinion the whole thing should have been one complete volume), but \\"The Secret Circle\\" is Smith's most intricate and worthwhile story - you'll get the most out of it if you read all three volumes in their correct order.<br /><br />In \\"The Initiation\\" Cassie Blake joined an elite coven of teenage witches living in New Salem, only to find herself in love with coven-leader Diana's boyfriend Adam. To make things worse, he reciprocates her feelings and soon Cassie is being blackmailed by Diana's cousin Faye to do her bidding, or she'll spill the beans on the affair. In \\"The Captive\\", Cassie fell into Faye's trap, and helped her find the sinister crystal skull that releases a `dark energy' that she suspects is behind the mysterious deaths occurring in New Salem. With coven leadership passed to Faye, Cassie's grandmother killed (but not before imparting some valuable information) and Faye preparing to reveal Cassie and Adam's secret, we head into \\"The Power.\\"<br /><br />With the unleashing of the crystal skull, the coven now finds themselves up against the original leader of the Salem coven - Black John, who instigated of their births in order to build up a strong yet controllable young coven. Though most of the coven's parents thought they had finished him off years ago, he's back and is now making things intensely difficult for the witches at the school. Appearing as the new principal Mr Brunswick, he impinges an oppressive regime upon the school that weakens the coven and gives added power to the likes of Portia Bainbridge - the witch hunter that Cassie met on holiday. With Faye on his side, he seems set to unleash a devastating hurricane on the township, destroying everyone in his way.<br /><br />It seems the coven are up against huge odds, what with the violent school students, a defunct Faye, the approaching hurricane, Black John's malevolent presence, and yet another terrible secret that is to be revealed to Cassie. But though all this, there is time for witchy rituals and blossoming friendships, especially with fellow coven member Nick - though there may just be a betrayer at work in the midst of their coven...<br /><br />I've said it before, and I'll say it again, this is definitely Smith's best complete work - she gathers together all of her familiar storytelling elements (ie, good vs evil, a love triangle, a series of murders, supernatural mysteries) and presents them in a fresh, interesting way. Dotted throughout are little subplots and ideas; most potent of all his her version of the Salem witch trials, and the way she imposes them on a modern day setting. In fact, Cassie's kidnapping at the hands of the angry mob of teenagers is quite harrowing. The forms of manipulation that `Mr Brunswick' uses at the school are cleverly used and have real weight in the context of the real world.<br /><br />I do however have some complaints, the nature of which bring \\"The Power\\" from a four star review to a three star one. Looking at other reviews, I notice that I'm not the only one disappointed at the resolution of Cassie's love triangle. Her relationship with Adam always felt too sudden and unconvincing (I'm not an advocate for love at first sight, especially in teen-reads), and it seems unconceivable that he would break up with the girl he's been with since primary school for a girl he's only recently met. On the other hand, Cassie had a sweet chemistry with `bad-boy' Nick, which is dropped suddenly and unfairly. Throughout the story, I toyed with the idea that the Adam/Cassie attraction (that seemed to be based more on hormones than real feelings) was actually the result of a spell Faye or Black John had cast in order to create divisions amongst the coven. Not so. Smith had the opportunity to end the story with two happy couples - instead we have one rather hollow one.<br /><br />Secondly, Smith often builds up dramatic moments only to have them fall flat. Faye revealing the truth to Diana has been a catalyst boiling for a while, and Smith even used it for the second book's cliffhanger. But it comes to an unlikely conclusion, with Diana simply forgiving the two of them instantly. Keeping in mind that this is directly after the traumatic switching of coven leadership, and the death of Cassie's grandmother, it seems implausible that Diana could do this so easily. Why not build up tension and leave it hanging for a bit longer? Why not divide the coven and therefore make its reunion more powerful? Also in this vein is the final battle against Black John - it's unfortunately utterly anti-climactic, and is over and done with in one chapter. That's the huge conflict that the entire book has been heading towards?<br /><br />Finally, many plot threads are simply not cleared up properly, and many readers may feel short-changed at the swiftness with which the end is wrapped up. It was desperately in need of a final chapter, just to see how the characters fit back into the normal routines of life and how they were effected by their struggle (especially with regards to Faye's abrupt turnaround and Cassie's father).<br /><br />But despite an ending that is somewhat unworthy of its beginning \\"The Secret Circle\\" is a good read, with an intriguing plot, a strong, realistic female lead, and enough good ideas to keep you interested.

But I would think most pre-teens would know better than to waste their time with such a cliched, silly set of books.<br /><br />\\"Kiss of Death\\" told of a beautiful woman named Rebecca Webster, who came out of the blue into Winthrop, Massachusetts and fixed her attentions onto a young man named Jeffrey Thomas, who seemed unable to resist her charms despite having a devoted girlfriend. But now, after a boating accident Barbara has died, and the way to Rebecca seems open to him. But she has her own agenda, and instead seems to want to simply torment him with her elusive presence.<br /><br />Bored yet? \\"Dreams of Revenge\\" is marginally better than the first half mostly because it actually seems to have a plot - not just a random sequence of `spooky' events, but is still filled with dull characters, forced dialogue, dangling plot threads, and an inconceivable premise that is as baffling as it is silly. Rebecca, you see, is soon revealed to be the Rebecca Webster that was hung as a witch in Salem. Now she has apparently come back from the end to extract revenge from the descendant of the judge that saw her killed. I say `apparently' because the author gives no explanation as to how she managed to come back, what she actually is (a ghost? A reincarnation? A time traveller?)  or why she thinks she's justified in killing Judge Thomas's descendant. Why didn't she just go after the judge? For that matter, why is it specifically Jeffrey who is her target - did she ever go after Jeffrey's father? Or his grandfather? None of the details concerning her life, or afterlife are properly explained or explored, and all the strange occurrences that took place in the first book and assumed to be the work of Rebecca are never touched on again. So how did she create the nightmares, the gruesome animals, her irresistible nature, and the odd weather...? How can she disappear into thin air, and why does she never eat? Why do plants wither around her and where was she between her death and her reappearance in Winthrop? How does she buy the old house she lives in? Why am I even asking these questions?<br /><br />The `love' story of the first half was made up of Rebecca luring Jeffrey, then pushing him away, over and over again. Now it's changed to her being openly loving toward him, then running away, loving him, then running away. Over and over again. The girl is so obviously out of her mind, that one wonders why on earth Jeffrey puts up with her - especially so soon after his girlfriend's death.<br /><br />Finally, the ending is so utterly unsatisfactory that readers will be frustrated and angry - I'm not even sure it could be called an `ending', it's just...a stop. None of the ideas or narratives are brought to a conclusion that makes sense, instead stopping at a place that offers no closure or explanations whatsoever. Please, give this book, and its predecessor a miss. They don't even qualify for my entertaining-but-negligible holiday read category.did she create the nightmares, the gruesome animals, her irresistible nature, and the odd weather...?

J. Smith, her most worthwhile trilogy. In the first book \\"The Initiation\\", teenager Cassie Blake and her mother moved to New Salem, where she was adopted by a group of witches within the school, who needed a twelfth member for the completion of their coven. There were complications however: although Cassie is instant friends with the coven leader Diana, Diana's cousin Faye is hostile and manipulative toward her. Meanwhile, Cassie has fallen for Diana's boyfriend Adam, and now Faye is blackmailing Cassie into doing whatever she asks - if she doesn't, she'll tell Diana the truth.<br /><br />And what Faye is after is the sinister crystal skull that the coven uncovered, but that Cassie suspects is somehow behind the awful deaths of several people within New Salem - and she knows that it'll become twice as dangerous if it ends up in Faye's hands. But telling Diana that her beloved boyfriend and her best friend have been cheating on her would break her heart, as well as see her kicked out of the coven. She seemingly has no choice but to get Faye the skull - but first she has to find it...<br /><br />Meanwhile, Cassie is investigating other strange occurrences around New Salem - she's been experiencing odd dreams, and her mother and grandmother's behaviour is still secretive and aloof. She finds a sealed and blocked off cellar at the local cemetery, as well as an unusual feature on the graves of the other witches' parents - all of them died in 1976. What happened that year to kill so many of the first generation? Another time phenomena strikes Cassie as odd - all the teenage witches celebrate their birthdays within three months of each other, almost as if the parents coordinated their children's' births.<br /><br />As well as this there is the usual teenager-novel fare: school dances,  joy riding, bullying, hormones, raunchy games, and a sprinkling of witchy rituals throughout. Finally though, the story accumulates with the vote for the permanent coven leader, a position coveted by both Faye and Diana, and a disaster that reveals much of the back-story to the terrible happenings at New Salem.<br /><br />However, the story ends with one of L. J. Smith's frustrating cliff-hangers which forces you to track down and pay for the next book before you find out what happens. I've always found this to be one of the most unappealing components of Smith's books, unlike book series like \\"Harry Potter\\" for example, with each installment containing a full, complete plot, Smith's books are divided into several volumes for the simple reasoning: they get more money this way. If there is a publication out there that combines all three of the books into one, I suggest getting that instead of spending money on three separate books.<br /><br />\\"The Captive\\" is possibly the best book in the series, melding several mysteries and plot devices into a whole, with enough intrigue and suspense to keep anyone interested. Cassie's dilemma certainly makes compulsive reading, as does the duality between Diana and Faye, and the direction that the coven can take. The figure of Black John lurks in the background like a sinister shadow (and is certainly Smith's best villain) and again Smith deftly portrays the relationships and attitudes of normal, understandable characters in an abnormal situation. Here we get to see a little more of the personalities of the rest of the coven, and although the Cassie/Adam love match still seems a little unlikely to me, it shakes things up well for the final book \\"The Power\\".ory accumulates with the vote for the permanent coven leader, a position coveted by both Faye and Diana, and a disaster that reveals much of the back-story to the terrible happenings at New Salem.  <br /> <br />However, the story ends with one of L.

Set in season three of the television show, \\"Powers of Persuasion\\" is one of the most worthwhile \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" novelisations out there. Author Elizabeth Massie brings together a great twisting story, lively characterisation and sense of danger and camaraderie that made the first three seasons of \\"Buffy\\" so enjoyable.<br /><br />Taking a male vs female conceit and adding to it vampires, Greek goddesses, mind-control, corpses, and even the Titanic, Massie creates an interesting and page turning Buffy-story. As well as this is the perfecting fitting subplot, dealing with the slightly more mundane problem of Buffy's parents' having alternative activities for her to perform, that will force her to make a decision between them. Massie has a good grasp of the characters (only Oz seemed a bit off-kilter to me, maybe a bit too talkative), and keeps the story rolling along nicely.<br /><br />Buffy is immediately suspicious of the two new students at Sunnydale High School; Polly and Callie Moon, who are demanding equal rights between the male and female student body, and taking this stand to extreme levels. Their mother Mo Moon is also on the scene as a library inspector that is making Giles's job a misery, and all three of them seem to have an odd definition of the word 'equality', since every man that is in their presence for long becomes a mindless servant, and every female a staunch supporter.<br /><br />Soon all of Buffy's allies are under the thrall of the three women, save Oz and Cordelia, and ironically enough Buffy finds added support within the vampire community. The vampires are not happy about the Moons' presence in Sunnydale, as they interfere with the quality of their blood supply. To top it off, the bodies of dead male students are being found around town, and their disembodied voices are haunting Buffy's mind.<br /><br />The mystery soon begin to unravel as Buffy pieces together the facts (that the sisters love jewellery and have 'magic' breath) with the information the vampires give her, and discovers their true identities. They are Greek goddesses (but I'm not going to tell you which ones - see if you can guess before Buffy does), and the Slayer has absolutely no idea how to kill a goddess...<br /><br />A full season before a goddess actually appeared on the television screen (Glory of season five), Buffy took on three goddesses pretty much by herself, by following her own plan. One of the striking features of this book is Buffy's independence and her extreme responsibilities, and with the absence of Angel and the bewitchment of most of her friends, she's on her own for the most part of the book.<br /><br />There are a few little complaints, namely involving the subplot of the dying high-school boys - there is no real reason for them to die past the fact that the killer just likes doing it (if you're going to kill people in your book, they should at least die for a decent reason) and how and why Buffy can hear their voices is unexplained. Likewise it is never really explained how the presence of the Moon girls affects the blood of the students which in turn cuts off the vampires' food supply. Massie also fails to wrap up a few plot threads: the goddesses are apparently summoned to Sunnydale by the actions of Allison Gianakous, but she doesn't seem to fully understand this or suffer consequences for it, and the conflict between Joyce and Hank Summers isn't fully resolved - what parent did she end up choosing?<br /><br />But all in all, \\"Powers of Persuasion\\" is far above average in the context of all the \\"Buffy\\" books out there. Massie is possibly the best author in terms of displaying Buffy's pathos - of a girl so desperate for a normal life, but who keeps on fighting anyway.breath) with the information the vampires give her, and discovers their true identities.

From the very beginning of the television show \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" Nicolas Brendan has played the role of Xander Harris, the only character on the entire show that didn't have super-powers, yet was surrounded by Slayers, witches, werewolves, Watchers, demons and mystical balls of energy placed in human form. Xander however, was just Xander.<br /><br />In this second volume of \\"The Xander Years\\" three more episodes are transcribed from teleplays into novel form by Jeff Mariotte. They are taken one each from the first three seasons and are \\"The Pack\\" by Matt Kiene and Joe Reinkemeyer, \\"Go Fish\\" by David Fury and Elin Hampton, and \\"The Zeppo\\" by Dan Vebber. They are framed by short introductions in which Xander drives around Sunnydale in his car pondering on the landmarks and his involvement in Buffy's life, and thankfully each episode actually centers on Xander. Often these 'trilogies' based on a character have nothing to do with the character involved (\\"The Willow Files\\" for example included \\"Dead Man's Party\\", an episode that didn't really concern her character specifically). Here however, a Xander fan can find pure-concentrated Xander.<br /><br />In \\"The Pack\\", the ingenious writers of the show highlight the theme of high-school bullying and cruelty by having five of its students possessed by the spirits of hyenas. Unfortunately Xander is one of them, and Willow, Buffy and Giles create a plan to remove the spirit from him - whilst being hunted by the Pack themselves.<br /><br />\\"Go Fish\\" concerns the Sunnydale High swim team, who are disappearing one by one. To watch the remaining team members more closely Xander volunteers to join the team, and is soon exposed to the swim coach's secret. This story is of special significance since it is one of the few times he gets to save Buffy's life instead of the other way around.<br /><br />Finally \\"The Zeppo\\" is the quintessential Xander episode, possibly of the entire seven season run of the show. In just one night Xander gets a car, resurrects the dead, looses his virginity, is held at knife-point, takes on three zombies and faces down a bomb-toting lunatic - all whilst the rest of the gang battles the Apocalypse. It is his episode above any others, and best displays his role within the group: the unspoken hero that simply does his job without demanding recognition. It also gives us the phrase \\"The Zeppo\\", which baffled me when I first heard it, but Mariotte explains its meaning within the narrative.<br /><br />Xander's other trademark characteristic is his uncanny ability to attract demon women, which oddly doesn't come much into these three stories (unless you count Cordelia), so if you want some of that try volume one of \\"The Xander Years\\".  Mariotte has a brisk, clear style that highlights Xander's virtues and shortcomings, and like all these character-based books has four double-sided pages of coloured photographs.<br /><br />I've always had a soft spot for Xander, and out of all the relationships/friendships on the show it was the connection between Xander and Buffy that fascinated me the most. Although I have nothing to back this up, I've always been of the opinion that his failure with women was simply because he never really gave up his love for Buffy. But that belongs in a fan fiction, whilst this is a great item for any Xander-fan, as is volume one.

Nancy Holder's style is somewhat bland at times, and certain scenes that have been known to get me teary on the television screen registered nothing here, but she gets the main points and emotions across clearly enough.<br /><br />In \\"Surprise\\" it's Buffy's seventeenth birthday, and her group of friends (Xander, Willow, Giles, Cordelia, Angel, Oz and Jenny) are determined to give her a decent party. Unfortunately, as time will soon tell, Buffy's birthdays never go smoothly, and resident vampires Spike and Drusilla are planning their own celebration. They have collected together all the pieces of the indestructible Judge, a demon that destroys anything with goodness inside them.<br /><br />This episode was followed immediately by \\"Innocence\\". After Angel and Buffy narrowly escape the power of the Judge, they slept together for the first time, which now results in Angel's curse rearing its ugly head, and a secret identity revealed amongst Buffy's group of friends. Now the Slayer has two forms of evil to deal with - the Judge, and the sadistic Angelus, Angel's evil alter-ego.<br /><br />Finally, \\"Passion\\" is perhaps my favourite episode of the entire show, which brought forth a beautiful score, a shocking death and amazing performances from the entire cast. Angelus is on a mission not just to kill Buffy, but to completely destroy her, targetting her family and friends with scare tactics and mind games in order to bring her down. But now he must take more decisive action once one of Buffy's allies finds a way to bring his soul back.<br /><br />Often the show is simply more powerful than what Holder can portray on the page, but other times the written word can offer more insights into the minds of the characters - her most potent contribution is Jenny Calendar's tragic and heartbreaking last thought. Likewise Angelus's thoughts on the nature and meaning of passion are just as profound, and fit in nicely with her framing of the story - two passages at beginning and end with Angel/Angelus watching Buffy's house.<br /><br />She also helps clean up a blooper made on the show - when Xander gets his idea on how to take out the Judge he tells the others \\"meet me at Willow's in half an hour.\\" However, the show then cuts to the next day when Buffy confronts Jenny, before returning to Xander's plan that night. Holder explains this by adding that \\"Oz's van was in the shop,\\" making them have to wait.<br /><br />Out of all of the novelisations out there, this is the one worth having.which brought forth a beautiful score, a shocking death and amazing performances from the entire cast.

Set in season one of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\\" author John Vornholt brings two new elements to Sunnydale - a travelling carnival and a pack of strange coyotes. Buffy, Xander and Willow are excited about the presence of a carnival to finish off the summer and soon Xander and Willow are hooked up with two exotic carnies, Rose and Lonnie. Buffy however, is distracted by the presence of a pack of coyotes roaming through the streets of Sunnydale. Although Willow insists that this is a normal occurrence, Buffy isn't so sure, especially when she sees the coyotes hanging around the grave of an old Western cowboy entertainer named Spurs Hardaway.<br /><br />After some research, Buffy and Giles learn that Spurs claimed to be able to change into any animal after learning the Native American skills of \\"skinwalking\\", and after she finds some conclusive evidence, Buffy realises that the carnies are the pack of coyotes that plan to resurrect their old leader under the Coyote Moon. Finding some surprising aid from an elderly carnie named Hopscotch, Buffy rushes to find Xander and Willow and convince them of their dates' true identities. But now the werecoyotes are on to Buffy...<br /><br />\\"Coyote Moon\\" is a reasonably entertaining Buffy-book, nothing spectacular, but retaining a sense of coherency and interest - plus a few unforseen twists and a good use of the werecoyotes' powers (that is, they don't just have them for the sake of having them - they *use* them to add to the completion of the story). One thing of interest in particular stuck out for me which may or may not have been intentional - right before Buffy sees the coyotes for the first time, she feels a cramp in her stomach. This harks back to the \\"Buffy\\" movie, starring Kirsty Swanson, told that cramps in her lower abdomen foresaw the arrival of danger - to which she replied, \\"Great, my secret weapon is PMS.\\" This Slayer power was disregarded in the television series, but Vornholt's little comment suggest it was not completely forgotten.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the show, you'll know how terrible Buffy is at lying and undercover work, whether it was the hopelessly obvious trench-coat and sunglasses she wore in \\"I Robot, You Jane\\", or the babbling she did at the door of demon-Ken's Family Home in \\"Anne\\" before she just gave up and slugged her way in. Here, John Vornholt instigates this lack of talent wonderfully, as throughout the course of the story Buffy has to scrabble for excuses and alibis, leading her to pretend she's about to throw up, claim that Xander is her boyfriend, and insist that she's a witch at different points throughout the story.<br /><br />There is however some rather sloppy writing and characterisation in the story, which prevents it from being a must-read Buffy book. For example, Vornholt describes Buffy awakening at four in the morning to the sound of coyotes killed a small domesticated dog. She rushes out to comfort the weeping owner, and then is said to be \\"amazed that nobody else had come out to witness this dramatic scene.\\" Er, it's four in the morning, Buffy - they're all asleep! Later, at the climatic finish in the graveyard Willow watches the bear-skinned corpse of Spurs Hardaway break through his grave. On him the pelt ripples as he begins to morph into the body of a bear, but Willow thinks: \\"it must be static electricity.\\" For heaven's sake, she's just seen the carnies change into coyotes and the corpse rise from the ground - why is she *still* trying to find a rational explanation? Oy.<br /><br />This leads to my second complaint, and that's the characters of Willow and Xander. This is set in season one, and therefore it's assumed that the events that took place in \\"The Harvest\\", \\"Teacher's Pet\\" and \\"The Pack\\" have already occurred. Since these episodes also included dates luring them to the cemetery, a femme-fatale shapeshifter, and people getting possessed by the spirits of animals, Willow and Xander's behaviour throughout the book come across as thoroughly stupid. Are we really meant to believe that after all their experience they're going to go with two suspicious carnies to a graveyard in the middle of the night? No way.<br /><br />Last of all, the ending is rather anti-climactic and abrupt.

Throughout the seven-season run of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" only three of its episodes took place on Halloween: \\"Halloween\\", \\"Fear Itself\\" and \\"All the Way\\" (in seasons two, four and six). Christopher Golden and Nancy Holder, who are possibly the most famous of the Buffy novelists try to fill in the gap of season one, with this: \\"Halloween Rain.\\"<br /><br />It's Halloween (duh) and Buffy is on her nightly patrol of Sunnydale before heading off to the Bronze to enjoy the Halloween party with her friends. But unfortunately other forces are on the loose - after a run-in with some vampires at the Bronze, Buffy meets up with the town crazy-man Glenn O'Leary, who claims to have seen zombies moving in the cemetery. Buffy sends Willow and Xander to get Giles and heads off to sort things out.<br /><br />This however could prove to be a fatal mistake. Giles has been researching the origins of Halloween and matching it up against a local Sunnydale legend: that a scarecrow soaked with Halloween rain will come to life and begin a slaughter. Willow and Xander arrive just as the pieces come together: Samhain was the demon-worshipped-as-a-god who now exists in spirit form within pumpkins and scarecrows, giving him the title \\"the Pumpkin King\\" or \\"Jack 'O Lantern\\". Years ago another young Slayer named Erin Randall fought and was killed by Samhain - but her Watcher left the details of the fight and how he might be killed.<br /><br />The Scoobies race off to Buffy's aid, who is at this moment going up against a cemetery full of zombies - called up under Samhain's power. Having no idea what's going on, Buffy ducks into a nearby cornfield to hide. But as the rain begins to fall, a scarecrow begins to stir...<br /><br />\\"Halloween Rain\\" is one of the few Buffy novels that would have made a good episode - and is in fact better than some of the episodes that *were* made. Golden and Holder manage to easily meld the 'true' mythology of the Celts, Samhuinn/Halloween, and the modern day practice of the holiday with their own fictional legend of scarecrows and rain. There actually *is* a scholarly link between all of these elements, making this book have far more resonance than it has any right to (it's only a one-hundred-and-sixty page teen-read!)<br /><br />However, I found when reading this book that I was not so much interested in the story as I was in the little bits and pieces of information and trivia that Golden and Holder sprinkle throughout. Among these was a look into the life of a past-Slayer, something that the show virtually ignored (only three appeared in the show, and of these only one was named) but something that always fascinated me, and a familiar looking zombie - remember Mr Flutie? Likewise, there's a reappearance from Aphodesia, who was a gossip in episode one of the show, and we actually get introduced to a person I always thought should have had a place on the show - the manager of the Bronze.<br /><br />It has been a long-running gag in the show that Halloween (assumed to be a wild night for ghouls and spooks) is actually the time that the forces of darkness take a night off - a typical Joss Wheden idea. However Golden and Holder actually take the time to explain *why* this happens in the historical context of the holiday - and there aren't many novelisations out there that actually explain and *add* to the mythos of the show.<br /><br />It takes a little too long to get to Samhain and the zombies (the first act is taken up with a botched rescue mission and your standard Bronze vampires), and in the seven year run of the show I never once noticed a cornfield in Sunnydale, but once it gets going, this is one of the best \\"Buffy\\" books out there - and it was only the second one written!day practice of the holiday with their own fictional legend of scarecrows and rain.

Richie Tankersley Cusick does an adequate job of transcribing the events of \\"Welcome to the Hellmouth\\" and \\"The Harvest\\" into book form, representing the characters truthfully, and making the action and suspense - well, suspenseful.<br /><br />Buffy Summers has just moved to Sunnydale, seeming to be just another beautiful, blonde teenager, but in fact harbouring a dark secret. She is the Vampire Slayer, the one girl in all the world imbued with the supernatural strength and skills in order to protect it from the spread of evil.<br /><br />And her arrival in Sunnydale seems timely. After meeting her new Watcher (trainer and researcher) Rupert Giles, and two new friends Willow Rosenburg and Xander Harris, Buffy becomes aware of an evil rising in the small town. Trapped in a buried church awaits the Master, a vampire ruler, whose night of escape is drawing closer. When the Harvest comes, he can draw enough power to open the portal between our world and hell: the hellmouth that Sunnydale unknowingly rests upon. And only Buffy can stop him.<br /><br />Along with introductions to Angel, Darla and Cordelia Chase, Cusick handles the material well, making this a short but sweet beginning to the realm of Buffy-based books.<br /><br />Wow, that was the quickest, easiest review I've ever done!	2004-09-02

First of all, if you have not read Philip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy, then don't attempt to read this story, as you'll be utterly baffled. But if you have, you'll be treated with another glimpse into the parallel Oxford that Pullman so vividly created and explored in \\"Northern Lights/The Golden Compass\\".<br /><br />The book itself is beautifully presented, bound in cloth and filled with engravings of the city by John Lawrence, a style of art that perfectly matches Pullman's atmosphere of a gritty, turn-of-the-century English city. Included in the book is a quote from an Oxford guide, an introduction, the short story itself intitled \\"Lyra and the Birds\\", a map of Oxford, and then a collection of bits and pieces that may or may not mean anything: a page from a directory, a postcard from Mary Malone, and a pamphlet and timetable from a cruise ship.<br /><br />The story itself is set mainly at Jordan College, two years after the events that transpired in the trilogy. Lyra is on the roof of the college when she and Pantalaimon spot a witch's daemon being attacked in the sky by a flock of starlings. Coming to its rescue, the daemon (named Ragi) claims it has come seeking her help. Its witch is very ill and only the gold elixir of the alchemist Sebastian Makepeace can help. Lyra promises to help, but there may be more going on here that she's aware of...<br /><br />The story is short and sweet, with several familiar names and faces popping up, and concerning the theme of \\"meaning\\" that Pullman explores throughout the book. But primarily, Pullman seems happy in extending and exploring his marvellous Oxford - describing the streets, the architecture, the *feel* of the place, and I had no complaints in this regard. Pullman's Oxford is one of the most detailed and interesting created worlds in literature.<br /><br />Pullman tells us in his introduction that all the things included in the book \\"might have come from anywhere. They might have come from other worlds\\" and that \\"all these tattered bits and pieces have a history and a meaning.\\" That is the reader's challenge when they explore this small volume - to watch out for clues and connections within the words that may point to other subjects Pullman has touched on before.<br /><br />For instance, we are told that Mary Malone's postcard was written before her involvement in the apocalyptic battle of the trilogy - and therefore the presence of the hornbeam trees on her postcard would mean nothing to her. But do they ring a bell with you...? Likewise, on a list of reading material found on the back of the map \\"Marisa Coulter\\" appears as an author, and make sure you read the page from the directory carefully - it has mention of another alchemist in it, and another strange occurrence involving him, a witch and the birds of the city...<br /><br />Does all this point to more books concerning Lyra?

Kate, Annie and Cooper have nearly completed the year-and-a-day of study in the field of modern witchcraft, and now only one last challenge awaits them: the aptly named Challenge Box.<br /><br />The Box is filled with a number of paper slips, each with a task on it that the girls are required to complete - without telling the others what their individual task is. They have two weeks to understand and complete their challenges before reporting back to the study group - and the speculation of the coven. If Sophia, Archer and the other leaders decide their tasks are completed then they will be prepared for initiation. If not, then they will have to continue their studies indefinitely.<br /><br />Each girl tackles the problems by themselves. Kate's task is to \\"Answer the question that has no answer.\\" Utterly baffled by this, Kate is further upset when her parents forbid her in accompanying Annie and Cooper on their holiday to New Orleans. Instead she must work on fixing up her failing grade in her science class. After a confrontation with her nemesis Sherrie left her with a fail, Kate is given a second chance to make it up. At the same time, she's found herself on the last stage of convincing her parents that her involvement in Wicca is an unchangeable component of her life - but maybe in this conflict is the key to solving her challenge.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Annie is grappling with her challenge: \\"Give away your most precious possession.\\" Realising that it probably doesn't mean material possessions, Annie puzzles over the challenge on her way to New Orleans, where she is meeting her elder sister for the first time. Juliet was adopted long before Annie's birth, and up until a few months ago Annie wasn't even aware of her existence. And again, the events occurring in her lifetime may be directly involved with the meaning of her challenge.<br /><br />Lastly, Cooper is stuck with \\"Face your greatest fear.\\" So far, she's been having too much of a good time in New Orleans to give it much thought, but figures that the challenges of performing on stage and eating crawfish have something to do with it.<br /><br />Within the entire series of \\"Circle of Three\\", this entry is one of the better ones. Isobel Bird manages to juggle all three of the girls' discoveries without neglecting one in particular, and although the Box's purpose as an accurate gauge for judging what girls are ready and what ones aren't are a bit dubious, the book does manage to end on a rather surprising final note.<br /><br />As always, some things bothered me: Annie wandering off alone in the middle of Mardi Gras for one thing (is she aware of the dangers in doing that?!) and the rather pathetic audience that supposedly \\"howled with laughter\\" at Cooper's improvisation on stage - it's funny, but it's not *that* funny.<br /><br />But Bird also treats Kate's relationship with the Catholic Church respectfully (unlike the more one-sided view she took in \\"Second Sight\\" and \\"The Five Paths\\") and miraculously gives us a *nice* representation of a Catholic priest.

US	39424751	R1CCHMHD4ISUWL	0609806505	148189446	Guenevere, Queen of the Summer Country (Guenevere Novels)	Books	1	15	17	N	N	"All the World Loved Us and We Loved Each Other"	The literary world is crammed packed full of books surrounding Arthurian lore - so many in fact that it could very well be a genre of its own. The problem concerning this however, is that because the main events, characters and storylines are already set out in the mythology, authors cannot tamper with them...at least not too much. This poses the challenge to present the story in an original way, and the latest trend seems to be taking a character and telling the story through their point of view. Obviously Rosalind Miles has done this with Guenevere.<br /><br />In her version, the city of Camelot already exits in Guenevere's home country, the Summer Country. It is a matriarchal society that worships \\"the Goddess\\", where the Queens choose their own husbands, but then take a champion/lover every seven years. \\"Queen of the Summer Country\\" chronicles the Arthurian lore from the time of her marriage to Arthur, the birth and death of their son, his adulterous affair with his half-sister Morgan (here chronologically placed *after* their marriage rather than before), Guenevere's meeting with Lancelot, her kidnap by her kinsman Malgaunt, and the beginning of her affair with Launcelot.<br /><br />In reading \\"Queen of the Summer Country\\", I couldn't help but feel that Miles had read Marion Zimmer Bradley's more popular novel \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" and decided to take Bradley's version of a pious, simpering Guenevere and make her a \\"strong woman.\\" The result is not a success. Miles's Guenevere is a thoroughly unlikeable heroine; bad-tempered, narrow-minded bitter, resentful and given over to long-winded trains of thought that usually concern how much she loves Arthur/Launcelot or how much the Christians suck. She gets worked up when Arthur makes even the tiniest decision without consulting her first, and yet gets annoyed when he appears too dependant on the advice of others (namely Merlin).<br /><br />The supporting cast fares no better: Arthur starts out strong, but soon becomes a depressed and spiritless king, Merlin is a lecherous man, and Lancelot is a nitwit who is forced to say: \\"the glory of the spring shines in you alone and the splendor of the stars live in your eyes.\\" Ugh. Furthermore, Miles unfortunately makes their relationship begin with love at first sight, rendering it completely implausible.<br /><br />The story and language is riddled with inconsistencies. For example, Arthur is declared the father of Morgan le Fay's unborn child - completely ignoring the fact that Miles also had Morgan sleeping with Sir Lucan at the same time. No one suggests that Mordred might be *his* son. Language-wise, the thoughts and situations of the characters are all over the place: when Guenevere first meets Lancelot we are told \\"She loved him and there was no turning back.\\" Yet in the very next paragraph we are told \\"She could not, she did not, and that was the end.\\" Huh? Did we miss something?<br /><br />Another similarity with \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" is Miles's treatment of the Christian faith. Now I'm not saying that Christianity was a completely faultless religion, but to portray it in such a black light is at first offensive, and then just plain silly considering the hypocrisy that comes into play. Miles contrasts it to the \\"better\\" religon - the worship of the Goddess, which is described as loving and tolerant. Yet they display little of either of these traits (unless you count all the sex they have).<br /><br />Guenevere in particular holds extreme intolerance against the Christians, responding to their mere presence with aggression and scorn. Even Bradley's novels were more lenient than this - she described the two religions as simply two alternative ways of worshiping the same thing; Miles presents them as two utterly incompatible, opposing factions. We are supposed to believe that there are actually two deities at work in the world - the Christian God and the Mother Goddess, for at one stage she declares: \\"The Father God - the enemy ofthe Mother, foe of foes.\\" Even the most self-righteous neo-pagan will be uncomfortable with this representation of both their own and Christian religion.<br /><br />With this comes the inevitable males vs. female conflict, with all women (except the Christian Abbess of course) as the victims, whilst the men are the ugly, evil oppressors. Women are allowed extreme sexual freedom (Guenevere actually looks upon those that don't have this as \\"wretched virgins\\") and one man is seen as the ultimate bad guy by trying to restrain his wife from taking a lover. But you should see the rumpus made when a man is unfaithful to a woman...<br /><br />Miles also has a rather weird obsession with woman's nipples - every time she describes a woman you can be sure the shape, size and colour of her nipples will be discussed.<br /><br />Ultimately, I have yet to find \\"my\\" Guenevere on the page as I see her in my mind - beautiful, noble and tragic. She certainly wasn't in this book.the enemy of the Mother, foe of foes.\\" Even the most self-righteous neo-pagan will be uncomfortable with this representation of both their own and Christian religion. <br /> <br />With this comes the inevitable males vs. female conflict, with all women (except the Christian Abbess of course) as the victims, whilst the men are the ugly, evil oppressors.

There are many opinions and discussions that one could have on Tolkien's great epic, but one thing is for certain: he saved the best for last. Even Peter Jackson, the director of the film trilogy was heard to say: \\"I made the first two movies so that I could make the third.\\" Everything that has been building in the first two installments now explodes across the pages: battles, intrigues, madness, escapes, disguises, rescues, chases - it's all here as the allied forces of Middle-Earth (Hobbits, Men, Elves, Dwarves and Ents) make their last desperate stand against the converging forces of evil.<br /><br />Like the previous volumes, \\"The Return of the King\\" is divided into two books: Book Five and Book Six. Book Five concerns the reunion of most of the Fellowship and the lengths they take in order to draw the Dark Lord Sauron's eye away from Frodo and Sam. But this togetherness is not to last - soon Gandalf whisks Pippin away to the white city of Gondor in order to stir the city up for battle, whilst Merry swears fealty to King Theoden of Rohan and attempts to find a way to follow him into battle. In even more peril is Aragorn, who decides to take the dread Paths of Dead in order to muster the ghoulish allies that may be found there - with Legolas and Gimli at his side.<br /><br />They will all converge once more in Gondor, (along with Faramir, Eomer, Eowyn and Denethor, the grim Stewart of the King) where the battle of their time will take place outside the walls...<br /><br />In Book Six, Sam finds himself alone in the terrible realm of Mordor after realising that Frodo is not dead, but now captured by the Enemy. After Gollum's betrayal, Sam has nothing left to do but sneak his way into the very fortress of the Dark Lord in the attempt to find Frodo and continue their journey to Mount Doom. But with the Ring now in his keeping, he becomes aware for the first time of its terrible lure...<br /><br />Everything that Tolkien has set up in the previous books come to fruition and is dealt with in its proper time and place - not always to happy endings, but to satisfactory and bittersweet ones: the fading of the elves, the cost of battle, the return of the king, and even Tolkien's subtle but vitally important Christian resonances in the course of the story. To point them out directly would be to take away your opportunity to discover them yourself, but keep in mind the triad role of Frodo, Gollum and the Ring: Frodo's continual mercy toward him, Gandalf's past words that \\"he has yet a part to play, for good or for evil,\\" and the divine grace that seems to intercede at a crucial moment, where the fate of the entire world seems to hang in the balance.<br /><br />At the end of the day, credit must be given where credit is due, and in many ways the hero of the piece is Samwise Gamgee. By the time we reach Book Six most of the journey is seen through Sam's point of view in order to better witness Frodo's decline and the intense devotion that Sam bestows on him. Perhaps my favourite part of the book is Sam's epiphany, when he gazes up at a lonely star in the sky - but again, I'll let you discover that for yourself.<br /><br />Reading \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is an amazing experience. By this stage, you'll probably be intensely invested in these characters and their situations, as well as enveloped in the detailed and three dimensional realm of Middle-Earth, the most vivid and realistic sub-creation that the literary world has ever seen, bar none. From the movement of armies to the pitiful sight of two tiny hobbits crawling up the side of a mountain; Tolkien can effortlessly describe both epic and intimate moments. In fact, in this contrast lies one of his most tear-stirring ideas - the careful and deliberate decision on the part of Aragorn, Gandalf and their allies use themselves as bait in the hope of the barest possible chance that Frodo will be able to complete his mission. The display of such enormous self-sacrifice is just...well, I'm lost for words to describe it.<br /><br />Just as Peter Jackson made the first two movies in order to make the last one, reading the first two books definitely has its payoff in this magnificent conclusion.ost for words to describe it.<br /><br />Just as Peter Jackson made the first two movies in order to make the last one, reading the first two books definitely has its payoff in this magnificent conclusion.	2004-08-24

Gabriel Knight was designed by Jane Jenson, and is a wonderful trilogy of games that deals with the horror novelist and bookstore owner Gabriel, researching for his new book by investigating the gruesome murders that have been occurring in New Orleans lately. Bodies have been found surrounded by voodoo paraphernalia with their hearts removed, and thanks to the fact that his best friend is Detective Mosely, Gabriel can get up close and personal to his research material. The \\"Voodoo Murders\\" as they've been dubbed by the press are causing quite a stir - though the voodoo is believed to be a scare tactic, Gabriel can sense a wave of fear among the practitioners of voodoo within the city. As he continues his investigation he comes into contact with a range of colourful characters - in particular the stunningly beautiful Malia Gedde, to whom Gabriel feels an almost supernatural connection with.<br /><br />But as well as this ever deepening mystery that points to nothing less than a city-wide conspiracy, Gabriel is dealing with his own personal problems. Since a very young age he's been plagued with nightmares, and now they have gotten worse. Scarily enough, the grotesque images in his mind seem to collaborate with certain elements of the case - a woman changing into a leopard, a strange curved-blade knife, three crawling snakes, a double circle wheel. The scary part is however, that he's been having these dreams since he was fifteen years old. With the help of Grace Nakimura, his sharp tongued research assistant, Gabriel unravels the mystery of his own family history, and how and why it is entwined with the modern day murders.<br /><br />\\"Gabriel Knight: The Sins of the Fathers\\" is classified as an \\"old\\" game now - it came out way back in the early 90's, but the quality of the intricate storyline and the strength of the characters still make it a very enjoyable game...provided that you can track it down. This novelisation however will sort you out if you can't, as it contains the complete story, as well as the inevitable advantage of being able to explore ideas and characters more deeply on the page than one could on the computer screen. Jane Jenson knows her creation well, and is able to fully flesh out her characters and the situations that they're put in. The descriptions she invokes are just as spooky and mysterious as they were on the screen, in a story that stretches over several centuries, from Africa to Germany to New Orleans. Jenson has a nice, clear narrative style (often the wrong people think they're qualified to write novelisations - thankfully Jenson knows what she's doing) and takes the opportunity to add in a few other little scenes that weren't present in the game. Predominantly among this is a fleshed-out version of the journal that Wolfgang sends to Gabriel - it gives a much clearer idea of what went on in Charleston in 1693, and makes Gunther and Tetelo's story a lot more meaningful.<br /><br />However, sometimes there are odd changes in the transition from the screen to the book - Gabriel's grandmother for example has gone from \\"Rebecca\\" to \\"Ester\\". Likewise, the details surrounding Gabriel's father's (Philip) death have been altered - in the game he is killed in a car crash when Gabriel was seven years old, in the book he is only one. This may not seem a big deal, but the game also reveals that Gabriel's grandfather died when Philip was also seven, leading the player to wonder if perhaps a family curse is a possibility. It doesn't come to much in this particular story, but I had wondered if perhaps the young death rate of the male family members (dying when their sons turn seven) would pop up again in future games - as I have not yet played \\"Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned\\" it remains to be seen.<br /><br />Furthermore, some things that happen on the game to do quite mesh well into book format- namely many of the puzzles that Gabriel has to solve. The prime example is near the beginning, when Gabriel needs to get closer to a police motorcycle in order to listen to his radio.

US	39424751	R1EL28XVT0BHD3	0451456211	1626677	The Beast Within (Gabriel Knight)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	"Tell Her, To Put This With My Heart..."	\\"The Beast Within\\" is the novelisation of the best-selling computer game by Jane Jenson, the sequel to \\"Sins of the Fathers\\" (also written in book-form), but you do not need to play the games nor read the previous book in order to enjoy and get the full benefit from \\"The Beast Within\\".<br /><br />In \\"The Sins of the Fathers\\" Gabriel Knight became aware of his heritage as the German \\"Schattenjager\\" (translation: Shadow Hunter) after meeting his last surviving relative whilst solving the Voodoo Murders case. However, with the death of his great-uncle Wolfgang during the course of the story, the task of Schattenjager now falls to him. He's inherited Schloss Ritter, the family estate, and the services of the lovely housekeeper Gerde Hull, and his latest novel (based on his last case) is actually popular! But along with all this comes the responsibility of his calling, and he's about to face his next case...<br /><br />The townfolk of Rittersburg come to his door one nightfall in order to inlist his services: a young girl has been killed, and the family believe it was the work of a werewolf. Gabriel agrees to take the case, and begins his investigation. The family home was outside of Munich, and soon Gabriel finds his first lead: there have been more than one wolf attack on the outskirts of the city, and the blame has fallen on two zoo wolves that escaped not too long before the deaths.<br /><br />But are these wolves really responsible? Gabriel follows the suspicious zoo administrator to a nearby hunting club, where he's taken under the wing of the charming, aristocratic Baron von Glower. Within the secret society's closed doors are a host of secrets and suspicious characters, especially that of the irrational and violence von Zell.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Grace Nakimura is minding the bookstore back in New Orleans. She was Gabriel's research assistant on the last case, and has eagerly awaited the arrival of a new case. Imagine her indignation when a letter arrives from Gabriel claiming Gerde can handle the research - she's off to Germany! But on arriving, Gabriel has already left, and Grace settles with researching werewolves. In the Schattenjager archives are references to not one, but two cases involving werewolves, and strangely enough both mention the shady figure of \\"the Black Wolf\\". The two cases are hundreds of years apart - could they be related?<br /><br />She believes so, and is intrigued when King Ludwig (historically the last king of Bavaria before its union with Prussia) pops up in her research. What could he possibly have to do with werewolves? And is it relevant to Gabriel's case? The answers seem to be yes as Grace begins to unravel the tragic mystery behind \\"the fairy-tale king\\".<br /><br />It sounds all very melodramatic, but believe it or not creator/author Jane Jenson makes it work. Both Gabriel and Grace's storylines intertwine perfectly, and her use of historical facts and mysteries surround King Ludwig and Richard Wagner was a touch of genius. Jenson definitely did her research, both on the historical enigma and on werewolves in general. Gabriel and Grace are both likeable characters, despite their shortcomings, and are backed up by equally intriguing people and places.<br /><br />Sadly, Detective Mosely is not present, but is replaced with Kommisar Leber (who is a good character in his own right) and the story gradually becomes faster paced and more interesting as the chapters go by. Believe it or not, you'll actually end up learning some interesting facts as you read, and you'll definitely never look at King Ludwig the same way again.<br /><br />If you have already played the game and are a fan of Gabriel Knight, then there are many reasons why the book could come in handy. More so that the novelisation of \\"Sins of the Fathers\\", the book gives more answers and details that are often missing in the game. For instance, it explains the reasoning behind the chandeliers and crystals that are so important to thefinal act, and reveal who the \\"High Priestess\\" is from the tarot card reading. Likewise, Gabriel's case is fully explained, something that was left up to the player to work out in the game.<br /><br />On the other end of the scale however, I felt that Jenson left out some details - they may not have been important, but they were nice little touches in the course of the story: for instance, Grace's prayer at the lakeside, where she places a lily on the water where Ludwig died and her visit to the chapel of Altotting with an offering for the altar - a silver heart that Gerde has given her. It is funny that I'm complaining about it since my main issue with \\"The Sins of the Fathers\\" novelisation was that it kept in two many computer-game elements, but they were nice moments, and I would have liked to have seen them included.<br /><br />The best way to describe the Gabriel Knight trilogy is to say it's a blend of Anne Rice's vampire novels and \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\". Anyone who likes occult mysteries should love these series, both on the page and the computer screen. As I mentioned, the intricate storyline is excellent and well worth a look for any supernatural mystery fan.important to the final act, and reveal who the \\"High Priestess\\" is from the tarot card reading.

R. R. Tolkien's epic \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, and begins right where the previous book left off: the Fellowship has been sundered, with the death of Boromir, the escape of Frodo and Sam, the capture of Merry and Pippen, and the chase that ensues on the part of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. Like the other two installments in the series \\"The Two Towers\\" is split into two books, in this case it is Book Three and Book Four.<br /><br />Book Three alternates between the journey of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in their cross country race across forest and plain in order to rescue Merry and Pippen. Their pursuit takes them into Rohan, the province of King Theoden and his people, known as the Horse-Lords due to their skill and affinity with horses.<br /><br />Meanwhile Merry and Pippen are held captive by the terrible orcs as they race their way back to their master, the White Wizard Saruman, who has betrayed his calling and given in to his desire for the Ring. Now he wages war on Rohan, filling the court with his spies, and sends his orcs out on a mission to find the Ring before the Dark Lord himself does.<br /><br />The two stories conjoin when Merry and Pippen are able to escape into Fangorn Forest, where they fall into the company of Treebeard - a mighty Ent, a tree-like guardian of the forestlands who is not happy with Saruman's treatment of his land. Likewise, the three hunters also find their way into the forest, only to meet someone that they thought was lost to them...<br /><br />In Book Four we join up again with Frodo and Sam, who are making their lonely way toward the land of Mordor and the volcanic Mount Doom in order to destroy the Ruling One Ring. There the secretive figure that has been trailing them since Moria finally shows itself: it is the twisted creature Gollum, once a hobbit, who fell to the power of the Ring and nursed it for many years. Now Frodo employs him as their guide - despite the mistrust of Sam - to take them into the dangerous lands ahead.<br /><br />But they too have their fair share of danger: as always the agents of the Dark Lord are abroad, and even the \\"good guys\\" can pose a threat, considering the constant lure of the Ring - enter Faramir, Boromir's own brother, who takes the hobbits into his custody.<br /><br />\\"The Two Towers\\" suffers like many 'middle' books do - it inevitably does not start anything, and it does not finish anything. But one must keep in mind that Tolkien hated the idea of his work being separated into three separate volumes; he intended them to be published in a single book. The publishers however had other plans, and since then we have been subject to authors who think their books are not proper books unless they are split into multiple volumes.<br /><br />But \\"The Two Towers\\" continues to expand and enlarge Tolkien's most wonderful creation - Middle-Earth itself. We are introduced to the dank and mysterious depths of Fangorn Forest and the plainlands of Rohan, based on the Nordic and Scandinavian culture that Tolkien was fascinated with. Just exploring these beautiful places is reason enough to read \\"The Two Towers\\".<br /><br />With the release of Peter Jackson's adaptation of the three books, it is always interesting to compare and contrast the two. Often the movies fall short in certain ways - often by reducing the nobility and goodness of several supporting characters, such as Faramir, Theoden and Treebeard, who need more pushing from the likes of Aragorn, Frodo and Gandalf to do the right thing rather than reach their own decisions. However, other times Jackson takes the opportunity to divulge further into little subplots and details that Tolkien only briefly touches on - the prime example being the relationship between Eowyn and Wormtongue. In Tolkien's words Wormtongue's lust is only briefly mentioned; but Jackson devotes a fascinating little sequence to it, with Wormtongue attempting to weaken Eowyn to his will.<br /><br />Either way, the movie is as must-see as the book is must-read, though if you have only seen the movie and decide that it's not worth reading the book, I strongly suggest otherwise. Although Jackson creates a near-perfect visual duplicate of Middle-Earth, the book contains details and information that the movie must skim over, or neglect completely. If you want to know where Shadowfax came from, or where Gandalf went after defeating the Balrog, or Shelob's origins, then you'll have to consult the book.ther way, the movie is as must-see as the book is must-read, though if you have only seen the movie and decide that it's not worth reading the book, I strongly suggest otherwise.

Even today, almost six decades since its first publication, J. R. R. Tolkien's magnificent work of fantasy is still attracting readers and scholars - more so now due to the publicity surrounding Peter Jackson's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" film trilogy. Perhaps for the first time ever, the movie release of a book adaptation has actually boosted sales of the book involved. And this can only be considered a good thing, as one cannot claim to be a literary reader without exploring Tolkien's Middle-Earth at least once in their lives.<br /><br />To outline the story seems almost redundant, but here goes: in the idyllic pastoral land of the Shire lives the hobbit Frodo Baggins, who is intrusted with an immense task. The magical Ring that his uncle brought back from his adventuring is revealed by the wizard Gandalf to be none other than the ruling Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron, who is now mustering his forces to find his possession and overthrow the world once more.<br /><br />And so Frodo sets off, with his cousins Merry Brandybuck and Pippen Took, and his loyal gardener Samwise Gamgee in order to conceal the Ring from the enemy and seek out a way in which to destroy it. His journey throws him into the path of the mysterious Ranger Strider, and the terrible Ringwraiths sent out to fetch Sauron's prize. Finally reaching the elven sanctuary of Rivendell, Frodo becomes a part of a larger Fellowship of men, hobbits, elves and dwarves, in order to make the perilous journey across land to the volcanic Mount Doom in the land of Mordor: the only place where the Ring could be destroyed.<br /><br />On the way of course are dangers galore - the betrayal of the white wizard Saruman, the legions of orcs plaguing the land, the pattering footsteps of an unknown stalker, and of course the lure of the One Ring itself, whose corruptible nature endangers Frodo from within the Fellowship as well as without...<br /><br />\\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" is the first of the three books in the trilogy, which in turn are divided into six books (two books for each volume). This new edition of the text involves several new additions; a note explaining Tolkien's terminology and linguistic decisions (such as writing \\"elven\\" instead of \\"elfin\\" and \\"dwarves\\" instead of \\"dwarfs\\"), a foreword by Tolkien himself explaining how the story came about, and the famous prologue \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" which introduces the reader to the culture of these small creatures and the history of the Ring that took place in \\"The Hobbit\\". Then of course there are the meticulous maps of Middle-earth, and the wonderful story itself.<br /><br />In creating his work, Tolkien had done something that no author had done before, or since (despite the dismal attempts at copying by the likes of...well, I'll let you fill in the blanks) - the creation of an entire world, complete with history, flora, fauna, landmarks, star plotting, folksongs and a thousand other details that make Middle-Earth the most vivid and three-dimensional sub-creation that the literary world has ever seen. In many ways the land itself is the protagonist of the story - it is what the characters are fighting for, and at times the land itself helps or hinders the Fellowship's progress.<br /><br />You can read this story from a thousand different viewpoints, whether it's the irrevocable fading of the magic in the world, the battle between good and evil (both internal and external), a beautiful love story between a mortal man and an elven maiden, the impossible journey of the ordinary-man to change to course of the world...the list goes on. Most touching for me however was the gentle touches of Christian idealogy imbued and combined with the realms of Faery, creating a harmonious and magical whole, not as heavy handed as C. S. Lewis's Narnia allegories, but meaningful, deep and beautiful.<br /><br />In reading \\"Fellowship\\" for the first time, one may be put off by the rather slow pace of the first book, in which Tolkien takes his time to set the scene, establish what's at stake, gather together his information and then throw in a singing Tom Bombadil. Trust me, if you hang in there to book two (when Frodo reaches Rivendell) then the pace will pick up.<br /><br />Tolkien has a beautiful poetic prose used throughout the story, sometimes soft and gentle, sometimes grand and epic. There has never been a better time to get involved with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" than with the release of Jackson's movie trilogy on DVD - read the book, and then watch the world unfold on the television screen.t the scene, establish what's at stake, gather together his information and then throw in a singing Tom Bombadil.

The \\"Abhorsen\\" trilogy by Garth Nix is one of the best sets of fantasy books out there, and so when my reservation for \\"The Ragwitch\\" *finally* came through at my public library, I sat down fully expecting another exciting, original, fascinating story. And I got it...kind of. Though I was aware it was aimed at younger readers than the target audience of the \\"Abhorsen\\" trilogy, I was a tad disappointed by Nix's tale in comparison to many of his other books - though this is unsurprising considering this is one of his earliest published works.<br /><br />Julia and Paul are two holidaying siblings, when Julia uncovers a strange ragdoll on top of a sinister beach-midden. Julia is transfixed by the macabre little doll, and to her brother's horror she is consumed by its evil and sucked through a ring of fire into another dimension. Despite his fears, Paul follows. From there, the children's paths divide: whilst a disoriented Paul tries to find his bearings and allies in a medieval realm, Julia finds herself deep within the Ragwitch's mind as she summons up her dormant armies once more.<br /><br />Finding a range of unusual friends, including a boy who can talk to animals, a young girl who can breath underwater and a wise man more interesting in gardening than helping, Paul seeks out the four elusive and dangerous Elementals of the land in the hopes that they can give him aid in the realm's war against the invading Ragwitch.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Julia is waging her own battle inside the Ragwitch's mind, aided by a humanoid Rowan tree that has purposely allowed herself to be consumed by the Witch and the former King of the land that is also trapped within her memories. Together, they go in search of the last vestiges of the Ragwitch's humanity, which may hold the key to defeating her from within.<br /><br />Nix's impeccable style and imagery is in top form; he can effortlessly invoke woods, valleys, mountains and landscapes to create a beautiful, three-dimensional world that one thoroughly enjoys exploring along with the protagonists. Likewise, I believe he is Tolkien's equal when it comes to creating character and place names that resonate with a deeper sense of sound and meaning: Yendre, Cagael, Anhyvar, Rhysamarn, Lyssa - all invoke the feeling of history and culture that other fantasy books often do extremely poorly.<br /><br />He is also a wonderful monster-masher, whether it's the gruesome Ragwitch herself, the winged Meepers, the Stone Angarling Knights or the terrible Gwarulch - these creatures would look great on the big screen... are there any movie-producers reading out there?<br /><br />However, \\"The Ragwitch\\" falls short on several levels. First is the abruptness of both the beginning and end: we are given hardly any time to get to know the children before they are whisked off into the next realm, and the end is swift and short with many an unanswered question and thread left hanging. Throughout the course of the story we are brought a bit closer to Paul and Julia, but never to any of the other characters: Sevaun, Leasel, Cagael, Deamus, the May Dancers - they may be portrayed as honest, worthy people, but they don't actually contribute much (if anything) to the course of the story. I read the book carefully once, and then skimmed through it a second time, and still couldn't find any point in Leasel's continual presence throughout the book. Without even giving us a reason as to why these characters exist, I could never really bring myself to care about their fates, nor that of the land they were fighting for.<br /><br />Furthermore, Nix counts on quite a few of the typical fantasy cliches and stereotypes in the telling of his story, least of all is the \\"two kids get sucked into magic world to battle against evil\\". The Ragwitch is an evil creature that was defeated once and has now risen again (like Voldemort and Sauron and legions of other \\"dark powers\\") and Paul's quest gets rather predictable quite fast: find the four Elements and get their gifts to the shadowy Patchwork King (who fixes the problem rather too easily for my liking).<br /><br />Yet despite all this, \\"The Ragwitch\\" is a good read, especially if you're new to the writings of Garth Nix - from here you know it just gets better!find the four Elements and get their gifts to the shadowy Patchwork King (who fixes the problem rather too easily for my liking). <br /> <br />Yet despite all this, \\"The Ragwitch\\" is a good read, especially if you're new to the writings of Garth Nix - from here you know it just gets better!	2004-08-21

You may have trouble with this book, and you may not like it, but I guarantee that you'll never forget it.<br /><br />Zoe Hutchinson has sought out Elizabeth Beckerdyke, an elderly woman who is renowned in her community as a witch. But she is not a neo-pagan, a tarot-reader, a clairvoyant, or a Wiccan, but a *real* witch, with *real* power, that can give Zoe back what she wants so desperately. And what Zoe wants is her dead boyfriend back. She misses Gary so much that she feels that she'll die of missing him, and in tracking down Mrs Beckerdyke she swears that she'll do anything in order to get him back.<br /><br />Duncan believes in this sort of thing too, but from a different perspective. He is a born-again Christian, and after experiencing the existence of Christ in his own life he is set to go out into the world as a soldier of Christ, to save people as he himself was saved. And after running into a distraught Zoe in the park, he learns what it is that she plans to do. He is unsuccessful in persuading her to leave the dead alone, but feels compelled to do all he can to prevent Mrs Beckerdyke from meddling with powers he sees as evil.<br /><br />But in Mrs Beckerdyke the two young-adults finally meet their match. Unlike any witch that Duncan has ever heard of, Beckerdyke challenges the beliefs he holds and agrees to Zoe's demands. But even she gets more than she bargains for when something follows her back from the world of the dead - something with an agenda of its own...<br /><br />Susan Price's novel is a story that is unput-downable. She plays with the question we all grasp to when someone we love dies: \\"what if...?\\" What if death was not inexorable? What if someone could be brought back from the other side? What if we could, through sheer force of will have our lives return to normal before the onset of death tore it apart? With this in mind, Price explores the many possibilities that death could bring - Paradise, oblivion or some dark and sinister Hades are all considered within the story.<br /><br />She gets into all three of the characters minds and motivations, all of whom are vivid and compelling, with feeling we've surely all felt: Zoe's despair, Beckerdyke's pride, and Duncan's hope and fear. Though none of them are particularly likeable, Price makes sure we are pulled into their incredibly unusual situation.<br /><br />Just as Duncan is not your typical Christian, Mrs Beckerdyke is not your typical witch - neither the devil-worshipping witch of Biblical lore, or following the benign practices of modern-day Wicca, this is a woman that has her own unique way of seeing the universe, rejecting both of the above-mentioned religions. The real religious intentions of Price are unclear - are we meant to believe in Christianity or Beckerdyke's realities? The fact that strong evidence is given for *both* cases makes this particular question extremely difficult to unravel, though I suppose at the end of the day Price expects us to make our own decisions.<br /><br />The best thing about \\"The Bearwood Witch\\" is what other fantasy/horror books lack - a real sense of the uncanny and strange. As a whole, readers are quite \\"desensitised\\" to fantasy elements - most of us take anything from elves to ghosts in our strides, and authors have long since expected us to take the supernatural elements of their books for granted. But \\"The Bearwood Witch\\" has the difference between the real and the unreal as one of its central themes. Due to the meticulously detailed settings and realistic human behaviour, the spooky side of the story really does feel unnatural and intrinsically *wrong*. If you want a \\"real\\" reaction to the supernatural and an unwholesome leaking from *that* world into ours, then this book will set you straight.<br /><br />The story itself is riveting, and Price even has time to poke holes into the popularity of tarot cards and other forms of divination, highlighting the futility and even danger of this particular past time. Toward the second half of the story, things begin to unravel into a more surreal scenario (most readers, myself included, will probably go: \\"whaaat?!\\") and the ending is *extremely* open. I was a little frustrated by the lack of answers that Price ultimately gives, but the ambiguity and mystery it evokes is well in line with the rest of the novel. Susan Price is a top-class writer, and \\"The Bearwood Witch\\" is well worth you're time, and will certainly give you something to think about.ld into ours, then this book will set you straight. <br /> <br />The story itself is riveting, and Price even has time to poke holes into the popularity of tarot cards and other forms of divination, highlighting the futility and even danger of this particular past time.

US	39424751	R13WYW7LCIMXMZ	0140367365	421559823	The Water Babies: A Fairy Tale for a Land-Baby; Abridged (Puffin Classics)	Books	4	62	65	N	N	"My Name is Written in my Eyes..."	\\"The Water-Babies\\" by Charles Kingsley is best described with reference to J. M. Barrie's more famous work \\"Peter Pan\\", both of which belong in the canon of Victorian fairytales. Kingsley's work is poised between two words: the world of Christianity and the whimsical realm of fairies, and the onset of the scientific and historical developments that resulted in the evolution theory, industrial factories and the War. Although certainly not as famous as Barrie's tale of the boy that never grew up, Kingsley's story is equally fascinating, though much more difficult to read.<br /><br />Tom is a young chimney sweep of London, under the brutal care of Mr Grimes who doesn't hesitate in sending him up the filthiest, narrowest chimneys whilst he collects the money from downstairs. Tom himself is quite the little savage, but when his master is employed at Harthover Place, he is in for a surprise. Getting lost on the rooftop and crawling down the wrong chimney, Tom finds himself in a room where three things change his life. The first is a picture of the Crucifixion on the wall. Having no idea who Christ is, Tom is rather intrigued by the picture: \\"Poor man, he looks so kind and quiet. But why should the lady have such a sad picture in her room?\\" The second is the young girl asleep in the bed, beautiful and peaceful. The third is his own reflection in the mirror, which horrifies him - \\"Tom, for the first time in his life, found that he was dirty\\".<br /><br />Accidentally waking the little girl on his way out, Tom sets the entire household upon him - out of the house, across the moorlands and down the valley to meet his \\"death\\" in a nearby creek, and his rebirth as a water-baby. And there his adventures really begin, as he investigates his new form, meets the river-folk and begins his journey to be reunited with the little girl in the white bedroom - Ellie, who has not forgotten the boy who woke her from her sleep.<br /><br />Like Barrie, Kingsley's story is chock full of allegory and moralising, namely concerned with images of baptism and rejuvenation, as seen from Tom's transformation from \\"dirty\\" (figuratively and literally) to the white form of the water baby, to the moral growth that he gains over the course of the story. Presiding over all of Tom's adventures is the Madonna-like figure of Mrs Do-as-you-would-be-done-by; a fairy queen that takes many different forms and names throughout the course of the story. As well as this, there are touches of the Victorian fascination with insect life, as Tom's `evolution' could also be compared with the pupae and larvae stages of the insect life cycle that (with the onset of microscopes) was being explored by biologists of the age.<br /><br />But Kingsley's story falls short in several aspects, namely when he is speaking to an adult audience rather than a child one. Though the story is subtitled \\"a fairytale for a land-baby\\" and the narrator is conversational and chatty throughout (in fact the style reminds me a great deal of C. S. Lewis in the \\"Narnia\\" series) calling the reader \\"little man\\" and often providing legitimate queries that the reader would probably be asking at that time, often he strays away from Tom's story to discuss his own personal opinions and theories on the general mindset of the Victorian world - some of which is amusing, some of which is tedious.<br /><br />For instance, Kingsley perhaps gives us the strongest evidence of the existence of fairies in the world - or at least why experts can never really claim that fairies, water babies and other such creatures do not exist. Only his own words can really do this justice; as the reader says: \\"But there are no such things as water babies,\\" to which he answers with devastating logic: \\"how do you know?

Anna Cotman is a sweet, pretty, vulnerable girl who has just moved to Redmarsh with her grandmother and facing the first trials of a new school, making friends and adjusting to her new life. But luck isn't on her side, and Lindy Miller snaps her up at school: \\"a bossy girl, quick to quarrel and slow to forgive.\\" After running through her own friends, she looks upon newly arrived Anna as a blessing and quickly snaps her up, announcing \\"you're my best friend.\\"<br /><br />Anna is delighted and eager to please, which is how she gets caught up with initiation into the club known as the Society of Masks (or the Som for short). Started by Lindy's brother Jeremy Miller and including all of his school friends, the Som is designed to prevent bullies and provide comradeship, including all the codenames, secret passwords, elaborate rites and junk food feasts that you'd expect from such a club.<br /><br />Of course, Jeremy didn't want his little sister to be a part of it, but his stepfather (who gives him the key to the abandoned factory in which they have their meetings) insists that they all be involved. And so Lindy is allowed, as is one of her friends, and Anna makes the vow of loyalty to the Som. At first she is happy - she's is accepted, she has a friend, and she's under the protection of the popular Jeremy Miller, who wears a golden mask at meetings and is known as the Goldmaster - she's in awe.<br /><br />But a friendship with Lindy has its costs; she is manipulative, jealous, spiteful and extremely difficult to get along with.

More people are initiated into the club - people that aren't school children and who control and bully the younger kids. On top of this, they never take off their masks. The Yellow Lord in particular makes life difficult for Anna, forcing her to do several menial chores about the place. Soon the youngest children are being forced to shoplift and work themselves to exhaustion.

US	39424751	RG8EJ5PS8R5WZ	0064471055	607344832	Prince Caspian	Books	4	1	1	N	N	"This is Magic at Work!"	\\"Prince Caspian\\" is the direct sequel to \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\"; the novel that was published second, but technically comes chronologically fourth in the Narnia series. In \\"The Lion,\\" the four Pevensie children become kings and queen of the magical Narnian realm and reign for many years, but when they return home they find themselves back in their child bodies, on the exact same day that they stepped into the wardrobe many years ago. A year later, the children are waiting at the station for their train to take them back to boarding school when they feel a strange pulling at them - and all of a sudden they are back in Narnia!<br /><br />But something is different - their beautiful castle of Cair Paravel is in ruins, and the land seems ominous and empty. Realising that the time-difference between the two worlds means that a thousand years have passed in Narnia whilst only one has gone by in their own world, the children feel quite lonely and displaced: strangers in a familiar land that has gone on without them. When a mysterious boat carrying a dwarf prisoner pulls up on the nearby river, the children rescue the dwarf and learn the story of what has come to pass since they last ruled the land. After their disappearance life went on, but in recent years the Telmarine (ie human) Miraz the conqueror invaded Narnia and drove the \\"Old Narnians\\" into hiding. The Talking Beasts and the dwarfs have scurried underground, the nymphs and trees have gone into a deep slumber, and Aslan has seemingly abandoned them. But the Narnians have one hope: the Prince Caspian, who was raised on stories of their kind and now leads a revolt against his uncle Miraz for the country's independence. The dwarf's tale links up his story with the children's', realising that the moment of their departure coincided with Caspian blowing Queen Susan's horn - which would summon aid to whoever winded it. Now the group head off for Aslan's How, in order to join with Caspian and defeat Narnia's foes.<br /><br />The story of Caspian is a somewhat patchy one as the viewpoints are continually switching and changing - first from the Pevensies', then from the narration of Trumpkin as he tells Caspian's story, and at one stage even from the point of view of two Telmarine generals. However, Lewis juggles all these narratives delicately, though possibly does a better job in the first half than the second. The trek of the four children to Aslan's How can get a little tedious, even with tantalising glances of Aslan on the way, and the one-on-one duel between Peter and Miraz is a little anti-climactic after some of the other vivid battle sequences that Lewis has described in other books.<br /><br />However, almost as compensation, Lewis gives us several moments of startling beauty and goodness - most prominently the sequence when Aslan returns and leads any willing soul - either Telmarine or Narnian - in a joyous revel through the countryside. There are other little touches like this, such as when Doctor Cornelius describes Caspian's mother as \\"the only Telmarine who was ever kind to me,\\" or Trufflehunter the badger quietly declares: \\"We don't forget. We hold on.\\" Most of all is Caspian's reunion with his old nurse that was sent away from the castle when he was only a young boy - I was ten years old when I first read this book, and I still recall how immensely touched I was at their reunion.<br /><br />More so than any other of the books, with the exception of \\"The Last Battle\\", \\"Prince Caspian\\" is tinged with heavy doses of melancholy and loss. For the children to return so long after their reign in the Golden Age, to a world that regards them as little more than a fairytale brings home C. S. Lewis's themes of loss and the inexorable passage of time. Even though Cair Paravel is restored to its former glory by the end of the story, to find it overgrown and in ruins is as devastating to us as it is to the children. Likewise, the children's eventual departure is also touched with sadness - their reign has past and must be relinquished to Caspian; furthermore Peter and Susan are told that they are now too old to ever return to Narnia.<br /><br />But of course, Aslan is always the same and this is in fact the Christian theme that Lewis injects into this book. Each one deals with a particular Christian allegory or way of life, and \\"Prince Caspian\\" is predominantly concerned with faith. Whether it is the afore mentioned Trufflehunter who holds fast to Aslan and the old stories, or Caspian who would desperately like to believe in the stories, or the sceptical Trumpkin, Lewis deals with the matter of faith from several different levels. Even the children themselves are \\"tested\\", with Aslan only appearing to those that are willing to believe that they are in fact following him - again this alludes to the children gradually growing up. It is easier to believe in something when we are younger than when we get older, and Peter voices the question: \\"why does he hide from us? He never did that last time.\\" The fact of the matter is that he isn't a tame lion, and sometimes all we can do is simply have faith that he is there, even if we cannot see him.re is also touched with sadness - their reign has past and must be relinquished to Caspian; furthermore Peter and Susan are told that they are now too old to ever return to Narnia.  <br /> <br />But of course, Aslan is always the same and this is in fact the Christian theme that Lewis injects into this book.

US	39424751	R25P1BL32H7JEG	0064471063	440200388	The Horse and His Boy	Books	4	6	8	N	N	&quot;He Seems to be at the Back of All the Stories...&quot;	In many ways &quot;The Horse and his Boy&quot; is the odd one out in the context of the Narnia series - unlike the other books, this one is set completely in the fantasy world rather than describing the movements of children from this world into that. Although two children are still used as the main protagonists, the entire tone, setting and atmosphere of this book is a little different - here we are simply meant to take this other-world for granted, rather than journey into it from hum-drum life.<br /><br /> Though written and published as the fifth book, chronologically it is third in the series (or if you want to get really technical second-and-a-bit) considering it takes place whilst Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are kings and queens of Narnia - grownup, but before they return as children to their own world. C. S. Lewis once more brings a wonderful fantasy adventure to children's literature, adding in a touch of Christian allegory and teachings, some unique and beloved characters, and a rather controversial satire on Eastern customs and ideology.<br /><br /> Shasta is a young boy who lives with his father Arsheesh in the proud and cruel empire of Calormen. Despite his simple life as a fisherman, he is captivated with the idea of northern countries, even though his father and most of the rest of the country considers it a haunted and cursed place. One day however, a visiting Tarkaan (a Calorman lord) demands hospitality for the night and Shasta learns that he is not in fact Arsheesh's son - he was found by the old fisherman, and his colouring suggests he is from Narnia and the North!<br /><br /> Immensely excited by this news, he soon finds himself discussing the matters with the Tarkaan's own horse - a talking horse named Bree, who is also from Narnia, though captured as a foal and forced to work as a war-horse. Together they plot their escape, and are soon on the road northwards! On the way they must deal with deserts, lions, ominous tombs, approaching armies, the dangerous city of Tashbaan, and two fellow runaways, the Calorman maiden Aravis and the mare Hwin, who are also attempting to reach the freedom of Narnia. Perhaps the most exciting and interesting part of the book is when the two groups are separated in Tashbaan whilst in disguise, forcing both into finding different ways of escaping the city, with the valuable information that they've both learnt.<br /><br /> C. S. Lewis has often been accused of both sexism and racism, and &quot;The Horse and his Boy&quot; contains the strongest evidence for both sides of the argument. On the one hand, the dark-skinned Calormens that sprout long-winded proverbs and ruthlessly attack with curved blades are obvious parodies of the stereotypical Arab world and its inhabitants, whether it is the gluttonous Tisroc, the lustful Rabadash, or the simpering Vizier. Likewise, the character Lasaraleen, an empty-headed, aristocratic ditz is a portrayal of women that Lewis presents frequently in his works.<br /><br /> But both of these examples are somewhat diminished in light of the character Aravis: she is both Calorman and female, yet she is brave, true, intelligent, Amazonian, and improves for the better after her journey. Though she never uses her sword within the course of the story (except to shear the horses' tails), Queen Lucy joins the archers in the battle against Rabadash's troops (who is &quot;as good as a man, or at any rate as good as a boy.&quot;) Complication piles upon complication - Corin's comment is obviously detrimental to Lucy's capabilities, but one must keep in mind that it is a young boy making this claim. Sometimes it's best to just accept that there are prickly issues to Lewis's writing and just get on with the story.<br /><br /> One thing that is consistent thoughout the books is Lewis's inclusion of Christian meaning, in this case it deals with the reality that behind every occurrence, whether good or bad, is the will of God. In terms of the story, it means that Aslan appears to the characters several times - often in disguise - to guide and drive on the journey in order for it to reach a successful conclusion. It is a comforting presence throughout, and it's fun to look back over the book once it's read to see events that seemed somewhat random suddenly make a lot more sense in light of this truth.<br /><br /> \\"The Horse and his Boy\\" is a great adventure story, and although Shasta's true identity may make some eyes roll, the journey that he must make in order to get there is immensely rewarding. It is definitely the different book in the series, (many who don't like the others find this one to be the best, and visa versa) and the one that you could perhaps get away with not reading without loosing the overall structure and meaning of the entire series.

Lewis wrote in the `Chronicles of Narnia', although chronologically it is placed first in the series, as a prequel to \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\\" This leads to many debates on when and where it is supposed to be read - but really, it doesn't make much of a difference considering that all seven of the books are complete stories within themselves. However, if you take my advice and are new to the world of Narnia, I suggest reading \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" after \\"The Lion,\\" as half the fun of reading it is to piece together the history of Narnia and how it fits into the rest of the books.<br /><br />Digory Kirke is a young boy in London, living with his great aunt and uncle due to the fact that his father is abroad and his mother is deathly ill. Life is not treating him so well at the moment, but all that changes when he meets the next door neighbour Polly Plummer, who is rather curious about Digory and his somewhat mysterious household. The two come up with a plan to creep through the rafters in the attic and thereby reach an empty house at the end of the row of houses. But something goes wrong with their measurements, and they end up in the attic room of Digory's own Uncle Andrew, who is surprisingly pleased to see the children there. Offering Polly one of several rows of lovely yellow rings, she reaches out to touch one, and to Digory's horror completely disappears! Coaxed by the greedy Andrew to follow her, Digory dons his own yellow ring, along with two green ones that will transport him safely back home.<br /><br />The adventures that follow take them to two different extremes: the dying world of Charn and the birth of the world of Narnia, both of which are filled with intrigue, suspense, and Lewis's wonderful way of mingling the magical with the miraculous. The origins of the White Witch, the lamp-post, the wardrobe and the realm of Narnia is all here to discover, and Lewis fits it all in very well with what he has previously established about his world in other books. The introduction to Queen Jadis is done particularly well, and remains one of his strongest characters, capable to leave us in awe of her strength and beauty, and in fear of her power and mercilessness. Uncle Andrew also is presented as a rather milder form of evil, a man whose morale understandings are utterly overshadowed by his desire for fame, glory and the continuation of his experiments.<br /><br />As always, Lewis adds a sense of Biblical allegory into his work, not so much as to overwhelm the plot or to be too preachy, but clearly enough so that readers are pushed in the right direction concerning what they're actually reading. Here, Lewis deals with the themes of temptation, the apple, the fall and the redemption that follows. In the course of the story Digory gives into his curiosity and in doing so brings a great evil into the world - in order to rectify this mistake he is sent on a mission in order to redeem himself, and keep Narnia safe for generations to come.<br /><br />My favourite parts of the books are the small moments of intrigue that are never really explained or explored, and don't need to be either - to do so would destroy the mystery of them. For instance, Jadis describes the fall of Charn due to the war between herself and her sister, and vividly describes the final days in which her sister leads her army to the castle gates and comes so close that they look each other in the eye. What this woman's name is, whether she was as evil as Jadis makes her out to be, and what the Deplorable Word that destroyed her was, we never learn - it remains elusive. Likewise, Andrew recounts the story of how he created the magic rings: with dust that came from the lost city of Atlantis, bequeathed to him by his aunt Lefay who was said to have fairy blood in her veins: another small pocket of fascinating detail and mystery that Lewis touches on and then leaves behind. His work is so fullof ideas that there is enough material for many more books to be written.<br /><br />\\"The Magician's Nephew\\" is an excellent addition to the Chronicles, and has within it all the magic, mystery and meaning that one expects from the Narnia books. Surprisingly, Narnia does not appear in the story till almost halfway through, but there is plenty to make up for it beforehand. Digory goes on to appear as Professor Kirke in other books, and both he and Polly are present in the final book \\"The Last Battle.\\" And of course, there's plenty of Aslan - how on earth could there not be?so full of ideas that there is enough material for many more books to be written. <br /> <br />\\"The Magician's Nephew\\" is an excellent addition to the Chronicles, and has within it all the magic, mystery and meaning that one expects from the Narnia books.

A. Salvatore. The novel based on the previous movie, \\"The Phantom Menace\\" was written by fellow fantasy writer Terry Brooks, and I'm not entirely sure why he was not enlisted to continue creating the books for this on-going saga. Unless he was busy with his own work, it was a big mistake not to have him also write \\"Attack of the Clones\\", not just because of his clear, concise writing style, but simply because when he wrote \\"The Phantom Menace\\" he added little details and hints that I expected him to follow up in the next two books.<br /><br />In his place, Salvatore does an adequate, but hardly exceptional job. Let's face it, neither one could be called a truly great novelist, but Terry Brooks had a simple yet detailed style that perfectly matched the Star Wars genre, exploring several of the ideas (the nature of the Force, the beginnings of Anakin's fall), simplifying the somewhat complicated and politic-driven storylines, and beautifully creating the visual splendour of the movie in his articulate detail. Salvatore does little more than recap what happened in the previous book, add some background scenes that were not present in the movie (such as Shmi Skywalker's kidnap and an episode set at Padme's family home) and transcribe all the dialogue of the movie into written form. There is no personal touch, no deeper insights into what makes these characters tick, and no understanding presented on who all these political parties, diplomats, senators and governments are and what they actually want. The prequels are a lot more complicated than the simple goodie/baddie format of the originals, and whilst Brooks sorted me out on all the opposing groups, Salvatore didn't quite unravel the plot lines satisfactorily.<br /><br />But this isn't to say that I wasn't completely baffled by all that was going on: for the few that don't know \\"Attack of the Clones\\" is set ten years after \\"Phantom Menace.\\" Anakin is now twenty, studying under the mastery of Obi-Wan Kenobi against a backdrop of political turmoil. The Republic is facing a crisis as more and more systems abdicate from its leadership to join a Separatist movement under the belief that the Republic is corrupt. The nervous Republic is now at a milestone: to create an army to defend itself, or to try and keep the tentative peace between the two factions. On the Republic's side is Padme Amidala, no longer Queen of Naboo, but the planet's diplomat to the Senate, and the Jedi Council, both of whom reject the idea of a Republic army and instead support a peaceful resolution.<br /><br />But after an attempt on Padme's life, the two Jedi are once more brought back into her life and assigned to insure her protection: Anakin to accompany her back to her home planet, and Obi-Wan to investigate the scanty clues provided to them via the assassin that narrowly failed in taking Padme's life. Whilst Anakin and Padme explore their own romantic inclinations toward each other, and Anakin grapples with nightmares concerning his mother, Obi-Wan is discovering a clone army that was seemingly ordered by a long-dead Jedi, a bounty hunter that served as the DNA donor, and the heart of the Separatist movement lead by the mysterious Count Dooku that suggests the Dark Side is at work.<br /><br />Just as in the movie, the weakest part of the story is the truly awful love story between the two protagonists. Salvatore had the opportunity to improve the insipid dialogue, but unfortunately we're still left with lines such as \\"I'm haunted by the kiss you never should have given me,\\" and \\"I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.\\" Urgh. On the other end of the scale, the highlight of the movie were the remarkable special effects and battle sequences, which are inevitably more fun to watch on the screen then to read about in the book. Salvatore must realise this too, considering most of the action packed third-act is dealt with swiftly in the book, without much detail or description.<br /><br />As mentioned, there are other sequences of back story that are reasonably interesting, such as the details of Shmi's kidnap, but I couldn't help but feel that in Brook's hands, these would be more poignant and meaningful. In his version of \\"Phantom Menace\\" he would often add in bits of detail that were there either for intrigue alone, or as a small nugget of information that would be mined later on - for instance, he described a scene in Anakin's youth that had him tend to a wounded Tusken raider. Salvatore mentions it in his book (testifying that at least he read the previous installment), but doesn't go any further with it than that. I couldn't help but feel that Brooks had plans for this little sequence - perhaps it would have added to Anakin's fury, or left him vowing never to help untrustworthy strangers. There are other moments of foreshadowing or clarifying in Brooks's story that just isn't captured here.<br /><br />All I can hope for is that they reclaim Terry Brook's to write Episode III, for as it stands, \\"Attack of the Clones\\" is an okay read and clear-cut novelisation, but does nothing to extend the story, universe or saga in any interesting, original way. Maybe I'm being a mean. Salvatore had a job to do, and he did it, making this a good book for young readers to better understand the movie-story.

US	39424751	R33FTZAE205SVN	0698119606	882766987	The Door in the Hedge	Books	1	41	53	N	N	&quot;We Will Look. No One Has Ever Thought to Look Before&quot;	Despite an interesting title and a beguiling title page, I honestly found nothing exceptional about Robin McKinley's collection of four fairytales. Whether her stories are original or retold, they are rather dull, predictable, and written with long-winded language that makes for sluggish reading. All are centred on the interactions between this world and that of Faerieland - or to be more specific, the interactions between young princesses and the inhabitants of Faerieland. None of these girls are individuals, instead they are cast straight from the princess stereotype and all the stories end on a slightly sickly-sweet note with each dilemma that the girls' face wrapped up in a nice little bow. Faerieland is not seen as a wild and elusive place, but as a pretty sparkling land with none of the depth or hidden meaning that fairytales are meant to have. They are sweet, pretty, *pointless* tales have nothing of the ambiguity or beauty that they could.<br /><br />In \\"The Stolen Princess\\", McKinley tells the tale of one of the last kingdoms that border the realm of Faery, and the anxiety that the residents face concerning the possible stealing of their children. This happened to the Queen's twin sister Ellian, and now the same thing has happened to happen to their only child Linadel. The King and Queen take it upon themselves to rescue their daughter, whilst she herself awakens in the Faerie realm to greet its inhabitants. The pacing of the story is extremely slow, the \\"love-at-first-sight\\" scenario is entirely unconvincing, and the descriptions of Faerieland are unimaginative and flat - it sounds like quite a dull place actually.<br /><br />\\"The Princess and the Frog\\" is a retelling of the princess who drops her golden ball and has it returned to her by a frog. Here, the Princess Rana is saved from the malevolent power of an unwelcome suitor's necklace by a talking frog. The ending is utterly preposterous: the frog returns to his human form, and challenges the suitor Aliyander - at this stage Rana runs out of the room, down to the pond, fills a flagon with its water and rushes back to dump the whole lot on Aliyander. Presumably, since no other explanation is given, we are meant to suppose that during this lengthy interlude of running and fetching water, the two foes simply stood looking at each other, since when Rana returns neither one of them has moved. Furthermore, how Rana knows that the pond-water will destroy Aliyander is completely unexplained, and therefore comes across as random and bizzare.<br /><br />\\"The Hunting of the Hind\\" is possibly the only worthwhile read, which tells of Princess Korah, whose kingdom is plauged by the beauty of a golden hind, the very sight of which drives men into madness. When this terrible affliction lands upon her beloved brother, Korah herself goes out in search of the hind to learn its secrets. However, this story too comes to an annoying ending: the hind is under a spell, which can only be broken if a person goes to the wizard who placed the curse and asks him to remove it. But to prevent the wizard from using your inner emotions against you, one must enter his presence completely devoid of any feelings. So Korah leaves her inner emotions in the keeping of the transformed hind (err, how exactly?) and asks the wizard for her freedom. That's it. I was expecting some sort of twist, some sort of test or trick that the young girl must go through, but no - that's it. To top it off, McKinley throws in a brother to the golden hind to act as love-interest for Korah - why must every Princess land herself a hubby in the course of her adventures? Can't she just have the adventure for its own sake?<br /><br />Lastly is the longest story, \\"The Twelve Dancing Princesses\\" which is told from the point of view of a middle-aged soldier, and is made all the better for it - by this stage I was thoroughly tired of McKinley's flat princess-heroines. The soldier takes up the challenge of solving the mystery of thetwelve princesses, whose shoes appear each morning entirely worn out, as if they have been dancing all the night long. If you have read this old fairytale, then there is nothing here that will surprise you - McKinley tells the exact same story, except she takes twice as long to do it. There is a slight shadow of intrigue with the appearance of an old woman who aids the soldier, but it's not enough to warrant the energy I used in dragging myself through this story.<br /><br />As you can see, this is a rather harsh review, and if you happen to be Robin McKinley reading this - no offence! McKinley is a gifted author, and I have enjoyed many of her books, but this collection just left me entirely unsatisfied. I've tried to give legitimate reasons as to why this is simply isn't a worthwhile book, without simply ranting at it, and the truth is that it just felt completely devoid of any real magic or passion.y of the twelve princesses, whose shoes appear each morning entirely worn out, as if they have been dancing all the night long.

In saying this, it only includes one character from its predecessing novel - Nick - and if you haven't read it, it doesn't mean you won't be able to understand \\"The Merlin Conspiracy\\". However, I suggest reading \\"Deep Secret\\", not just because it's a good read for its own sake, but because it will give you a basic understanding of the concepts of the Multiverse and Magids that Jones once again instigates in this latest story.<br />Arianrhod \\"Roddy\\" Hyde is the daughter of two court wizards who travel with the King's Progress, the on-going court progression of the King, the Merlin and his entire court that ensures the wellbeing of the Isles of Blest (a parallel-world version of the Isles of Britain). Her life revolves around rituals, ceremonies, court life and looking after her young friend Grundo, who has a rather nasty mother and sister. This mother Sybil seems to have a secret plan - after the death of the old Merlin and the appointment of the new, and an enchantment that renders everybody except Roddy and Grundo under her spell, Roddy seeks the help of her two grandfathers who might shed some light on the situation.<br />Meanwhile, Nick Mallory (the only returning character from the afore-mentioned \\"Deep Secret\\") lives a rather ordinary life (not surprising since he lives on our Earth) but has big dreams of becoming a Magid and travelling into other worlds. His wish is abruptly granted when he finds himself in another world, mistaken for somebody else, and soon dodging police officers and assassins in order to reach the dark paths - the place that allows for travel between the worlds. After meeting the intensely powerful Romanov, and Roddy who summons his help in Blest, Nick is soon a player in the unfolding tangle of secrets and plots.<br />Their two stories are told in alternating chapters as the Merlin Conspiracy unravels, and has everything one has come to expect from Diana Wynne Jones: magical islands, time manipulation, races through the universe, contemporary myths, quirky characters, imposters, and an elephant! As usual the author comes up with some fascinating ideas such as personified cities and magical, intelligent dinnerware, and a twisting, intricate plot in which every little detail can end up having great importance and ramifications. This indeed seems to be the main theme of the book - that one tiny word or gesture can have life-altering consequences, for either good or bad.<br />Roddy and Nick are both great characters that speak to the reader directly in first-person narrative, and in doing so the reader is able to learn the characters' impressions of each other, making them more three-dimensional figures. After all, a person talking in first-person narrative is hardly qualitified to point out their *own* faults, but Nick and Roddy are more than able to analyse and critise each other! Unfortunately, most of the likeable characters from \\"Deep Secret\\" are not back, but Jones has always been original, and it is to be commended that she can create an entirely different story within the same regulations of her created universe without resorting to repeating herself.<br /><br />There are more nasty villains, in the form of Sybil, Sir James, Alicia and the severely annoying Izzies, and Jones again shows her skill in forming realistic human behaviour and relationships - take for example the prickly meeting that Grandmother Heppy and Roddy share. Furthermore, Jones's trademark use of time-travelling and parallel universes are used in such a way that they make you think, not go cross-eyed with confusion.<br />\\"The Merlin Conspiracy\\" is perhaps geared toward older readers than most of her other books (there is a *huge* cast of characters), but anyone who knows Jones and her books well will concede that although this is not her greatest story, but it still a very entertainingread.ad.	2004-07-14

In the 21st century an invention has finally been perfected: The Time Tube, which allows contemporary scientists, researches and corporate money-makers to travel back into the 16th century and mingle with the locals there. Think of the possibilities! Plentiful supplies of oil, gold and coal, an extraordinary opportunity to study ancient life, and a pollution-free resort for those wealthy enough to make the trip. The corporation FUP has already purchased the troublesome borderlands between 16th century Scotland and England in order to begin development.<br />But there's just one problem: the Sterkarms. This warrior tribe are those that lay claim to the land, and have a reputation that has gained themselves the saying: \\"Never shake hands with a Sterkarm.\\" Since all the Sterkarms are left-handed, it is easy for them to conceal a dagger in their right hands whilst shaking with their left, and as such are utterly untrustworthy. They consider the 21st century people to be the \\"Elves\\" from their folklore, yet despite negotiations and bribes of the Elves \\"wee white pills\\" (that is, aspirin), the Sterkarms have no real interest in giving up their lands and way of life in order for the Elves to move in - in fact their raids upon survey teams have begun to be a nuisance to the 21st-siders.<br />Andrea Mitchell is a young field-researcher, caught directly between the two sides. On the one hand is the needs/wants of her own world, and the demands of her superior Windsor who holds her career in the palm of her hand. On the other is the Sterkarms who have welcomed her into their lives like a guest and whom she has come to greatly respect and admire. On top of this she has developed feelings for the chieftain's son Per, and he for her, which makes her mediating role a *lot* more complicated.<br />Susan Price presents a wonderfully thought-provoking novel that deals with the inevitable discord between two opposing cultures when one wants something from the other. She is (thankfully) very gifted in presenting a case for both sides of the argument and paints rather a lot of grey within the situation. The Sterkarms are not presented as tree-hugging, circle-dancing New-Agers like many books that deal with such people do, but instead as warm, affectionate *loving* people that nevertheless engage in warfare, torture, bloodlust and selective memory whenever it suits them. On the other end of the scale is Windsor, who looks upon Sterkarms as \\"overgrown, rather dim and naughty children\\". This is to his own detriment considering the Sterkarms are more than capable of beheading him and displaying his head should it ever suit them. Both sides are so vividly portrayed that I felt myself switching alliances whenever the narrative moved: when the 21st century thugs were called in to exterminate the Sterkarms I hoped the Sterkarms would give them what was coming to them, but when the self-same men attempted an escape in the night, I was terrified for them that the Sterkarms would discover them.<br />As the story begins, the Sterkarms ride out to retrieve stolen sheep from an enemy tribe rather than allow the 21st-siders to take care of it, and end up returning with a severely injured Per. A distraught Andrea and a conniving Windsor take him through the Tube and into the future, with Windsor plotting to use the beloved son as a hostage for the chieftain Toorkild's good behaviour. From there the crisis escalates as the two sides declare war on each other, with both sides severely underestimating the other, and Andrea caught once more in the middle: should she help the men that the Sterkarms hold captive, knowing that they had come into the past to slaughter them all? Or should she side with the Sterkarms knowing that their way of life might be obliterated with the greed of Windsor and his corporation? And finally comes the ultimate decision: to stay with her love Per in a world of drudgery and peril, or to give him up and stay in the drab and somewhat meaningless world of the 21st century.<br />\\"The Sterkarm Handshake\\" is a dense, immensely complicated book in its themes of intolerance, misunderstanding and inability to communicate: perhaps the main causes of all bloodshed in invasions and colonisation in our history books. Ultimately of course, the conclusion is somewhat melancholy; given that no real solution exists either in the book or in the real world to reconcile such different groups that live in such radically different ways. Price brings these differences to light wonderfully, what with Per's experiences in \\"Elfland\\" and Windsor's growing realisation that the Sterkarms cannot be controlled so easily.<br />Furthermore, the use of the 21st century people as \\"Elves\\" is great to read if you are familiar with the folklore surrounding such beings, and the Sterkarm's interpretation of Andrea and the other's behaviour in terms of their limited knowledge. In fact, all of the Sterkarm's way of life is meticulously presented and realistic. \\"The Sterkarm Handshake\\" is a heavy read, but a rewarding one, and suitable for either gender above the age of ten, with enough ambiguity to keep one thinking for a very long time. Time travelling stories usually leave me cross-eyed, but since the Time Tube actually takes our contemporaries to another dimension, as well as another time, then there are no difficulties in trying to puzzle out the ramifications of such a visitation - ie, Andrea doesn't end up being her own great-great-something-grandmother, or other such confusing elements.ss world of the 21st century.<br />\\"The Sterkarm Handshake\\" is a dense, immensely complicated book in its themes of intolerance, misunderstanding and inability to communicate: perhaps the main causes of all bloodshed in invasions and colonisation in our history books.

Motifs such as the animalistic husband, the vengeful sorceress, an interfering mother who gives dangerous advice, the taboo upon seeing the mystery-man's face, the task that only the \\"true bride\\" can perform, and the young woman's quest to reclaim her husband can be found in everything from the Greek/Roman \\"Cupid and Psyche\\" to France's \\"Beauty and the Beast.\\" Details change in every version, but the core of the tale is the same each time.<br />Edith Pattou uses the Norwegian version as her template, which has the prince changed into a polar bear through the designs of an enamoured troll-queen. In order to break the curse the bear must take a human companion, who is forbidden to see his face for an entire year. Of course, the young heroine Rose breaks this rule; she must do this of course, or else the reader would be deprived of the quest to undo her wrong and save her beloved.<br />Pattou puts her personal slant on the tale by adding in the superstition concerning \\"birth-direction.\\" Rose's mother Eugenia lives strictly in the belief that the direction in which an infant is brought into the world has a bearing on the personality and fate of that child. She plans to have only seven children, one for each direction (beginning at north-east and ending at north-west), and missing out on the final compass point: north. The reason for this is that north-born children are wild and reckless, liable to go wandering far and wide. But when her east-born daughter (east-borns being the most sturdy and reliable characters) dies, Eugenia bears another child to take her place. But you guessed it, Rose is a north-born child and so struck with wanderlust.<br />From here come the typical elements of any fairytale: Rose is a free spirit and comes into contact with a strange white bear, who offers the family wealth in exchange for their youngest daughter. With another child deathly ill and the family set for eviction from their home, Rose takes up the bear's offer and is carried to his underground mountain home. Here she keeps company with the bear and his two strange servants, and each night is visited by an unseen bed-fellow that is gone before the morning light. Curiosity gets the best of her, and with the aid of an ill-favoured gift from her mother, she steals a glance at the person beside her...resulting in him being whisked away by the troll-queen. Needless to say, Rose heads off on a rescue mission.<br />Pattou saves us from a dull, predictable retelling by telling the story through the points of view of several characters. Thus the tale is told in first-person narrative by Rose, the white bear, the troll-queen, Rose's father and Rose's brother Neddy throughout the book, forming a story that must be pieced together from several different lives and viewpoints. Perhaps most interesting of all is Pattou's take on the troll-queen; not just a vicious creature out for power, but someone who genuinely loves the bewitched young man for himself alone. Likewise, her young heroine Rose is a fine example of a strong, realistic protagonist, who has to *work* for her heart's desire.<br />However, there are some elements that simply don't work. Often the narrative is plodding and inevitably predictable, and the fairytale plot element in which Rose and the troll-queen were forced to test their sincerity by attempting to remove a stain from the young man's shirt was handled awkwardly and confusingly. The fate of the troll-queen and the ice-palace was quite abrupt, and if one reads carefully, the turning point of the story (when Rose looks at the young man's face) doesn't make a lot of sense. The conditions of the bear's curse are that he mustn't let anyone see his human face. And since he and Rose are not married (his nocturnal visits are strictlyrated G), then why does he even sleep in the same bed with her in the first place? In the original folktales, the man and woman are wed, and thus have a very good reason to share a bed, but without this rather crucial plot development both the bear's and Rose's actions before and after the event have no reason to them. Pattou's desire to draw out the love-story, with marriage at its end rather than at its middle makes it somewhat unconvincing overall.<br />Yet despite this, \\"East\\" is still a fine example of a well structured and re-interpreted folktale. The old myths and legends of the world are always fascinating, and therefore in the hands of an adept author nothing major can go wrong.tly rated G), then why does he even sleep in the same bed with her in the first place?

As one can possibly guess, it's nearly impossible for someone to begin reading this series at this book - you at *least* have to read Book Three: \\"The Emperor Mage\\", though ideally you should have all three previous books under your belt: \\"Wild Magic\\" and \\"Wolf-Speaker\\" just to have the complete picture of what's going on here.<br />And what's going on is that our sixteen year old heroine and her mentor Numair are constantly on the move as they do their part for the kingdom against the hoards of immortal monsters spilling over the now-destroyed barrier between the mortal and divine realms and are marching against Tortall. Daine is sure that behind all of this is the ex-Emperor Ozorne, whom she toppled from his throne the previous year and is now out for revenge.<br />But there is another force also working against them, and indeed against the very gods themselves: Uusoae, the Goddess of Chaos who is using her newfound alliance with Ozorne to wage war against all the realms. It is in the middle of this tempest that Daine finds herself, but when she and Numair are nearly killed, the gods themselves intervene. Here finally, Daine learns the truth about her parentage, and the identity of her long-absent father.<br />But as happy as she is to be with her mother and father once more, she and Numair are very aware of the plight of their friends back home, and their importance in the coming battle. But the only way to return to the mortal realms is to beseech the help of the dragons, and to get there the two must take a dangerous journey across the Realms of the Gods...<br />Tamora Pierce really outdoes herself in this final installment, and though many may disagree, I feel that this is her best book to date, melding together a range of themes and ideas, with the cosmic battle of the gods contrasted against the human Battle of Port Legann; Daine's parental fear toward Kit the dragonet against the blossoming romance she feels for her long-time friend and mentor. Moments that feel utterly epic are matched against the everyday necessities of life, and throughout it all Daine remains an immensely likeable heroine: trustworthy, courageous, loving, kind and intelligent.<br />For those who have followed Daine's journey throughout the four books, this should be an immensely satisfying conclusion, filled with familiar faces: Tkaa, Kit, the badger, Jonathon and Thayet, and several new and equally fascinating ones: Gainel, the silent god of dreams (who gives Daine some fascinating dreams), Broad Foot, the god of the duck-moles and Weiryn, Daine's very own father. Most importantly for me though was the Stormwing Rikash, whose inclusion in the story completes Daine's self-growth: from a young woman who blindly hated and destroyed that particular race, to a woman who comes to consider one a friend. It is a particularly sublime bit of character development.<br />In fact, if there is one thing wrong with \\"Realms of the Gods\\", it is that there isn't enough of it! It could quite easily have been a novel twice as big, had Pierce taken the time to unfold the story a bit more gradually. The book is a treasure-chest of information and ideas, and I would have enjoyed reading more of it, at a more leisurely pace. However, it's fine just the way it is, and because it's a young-adult book, I can understand why she chose to keep the pace moving along swiftly.<br />I would have liked to have seen more from Kit, Alanna, Onua and Cloud (in particular I was sure that Kit's role had been building up in order to play a major part in this book) but the huge range of other characters compensate. The Daine/Numair romance might take some readers by surprise (she's sixteen, and he's thirty!) but they do make a strong, realistic couple, void of the mushy hearts and flowers of the usual courtly love to be found in fantasy. For those that are interested, we find out the nameof Kit's mother, but strangely the badger remains simply \\"the badger\\". Finally, we are treated to a nice council of the gods at the conclusion of the story, and if you read closely enough, you might catch a cameo-appearance from a certain purple-eyed cat from the \\"Song of the Lioness\\" quartet!of Kit's mother, but strangely the badger remains simply \\"the badger\\".

Forms of entertainment are a funny things these days: first there was literature, and then movies that were either original, or based upon the earlier books. Now it's common to go to the movie theatre in order to watch a movie based on a theme-park ride (\\"Pirates of the Carribean\\") or a computer game (\\"Lara Croft\\"), or read a book based on a television series (titles from the \\"Charmed\\" series). \\"Chaos Bleeds\\" is another bizarre first: a book based on a video game based on a highly popular television series.<br />Even if the words \\"based on the video game\\" wasn't stamped on the cover of this Buffy the Vampire Slayer novelisation, I suspect that most shrewd readers would guess that this was not your average \\"Buffy\\" book, given the sheer amount of action and fighting that takes place in it. In fact the lack of character interaction, the simplistic \\"find-the-body-part\\" narrative and the sense of surrealism that the other dimensions create adds to the atmosphere of the hack-and-slash world of video games.<br />Buffy and the Scooby Gang are drawn into a massive arena of fighting when an old nemesis Ethan Rayne re-appears in Sunnydale and breaks to them some rather appalling news: he has made a deal with the entity known as the First Evil in a bid for power. The deal is that the two adversaries will choose five champions and pit them against each other. Ethan has chosen Buffy, Spike, Willow, Faith and (in the absence of Oz) Xander, who must fetch the five body parts of Cassandra Rayne, Ethan's ancestress who holds the key to destroying the First. But the First has his own champions, and has bent the rules a bit by selecting them from other dimensions, which means that previously defeated foes are now back in action: Kakistos, Adam, Anyanka, Drusilla and more. A little help comes from the wooden-dummy Sid, who apparently didn't get heaven-sent after killing the last demon in Season One's episode \\"The Puppet Show\\", and instead shows up to inform the Slayer about Hope's Dagger, the only weapon that can defeat the First.<br />It is an interesting concept, and a good way to reintroduce popular characters that no longer have a place on the television show (I'm just sorry they didn't include more - what about Angelus? Darla? The Mayor? Snyder?), but it's perfectly obvious that its true format belongs on the Playstation/X-Box/Nintendo/whatever console. Page upon page is packed full of characters fighting: kicking, punching, stabbing, running, elbowing, shooting, head-butting...and needless to say reading action sequences are utterly boring compared to watching them on the T.V. (or in this case *controlling* them on the T.V.).<br />Furthermore, \\"Chaos Bleeds\\" does some serious damage to the continuity of the show: it's set in Season Six (ie, Joyce is dead, Tara's still alive, Spike's chipped), and is seemingly unaware that Buffy goes up against the First once more in Season Seven, where she certainly makes no mention on the show of this particular run-in with the First, nor her triumph over It. Neither does it try to explain how Faith gets back into prison or what actually happens to Ethan (easily one of the show's most popular villians) after all this occurs.<br />Which is a shame, since James A. Moore is otherwise so careful throughout the book not to contradict anything that has previously happened on the show, which is to the book's detriment. He almost seems afraid to gives us any new information on the characters that could have churned up my interest in the book's progression - for instance, he often mentions Faith's first Watcher (all we know about her from the show was that she was female and died messily at the hands of Kakistos), yet he doesn't take the opportunity to tell us anything more about her - not even her name! I've always found this to be an untouched mystery well-worth exploring, but Moore seemed reluctant to give us anything on the character's backgrounds that hadn't already been mentioned on the show (and was thereforealready known to 99% of the readers).<br />Maybe I'm being a bit harsh in my assessment - for all I know Moore was drafted into writing this novelisation, but the fact remains that it is a somewhat confusing and irrelevant addition to the stock of Buffy-inspired books.e already known to 99% of the readers).<br />Maybe I'm being a bit harsh in my assessment - for all I know Moore was drafted into writing this novelisation, but the fact remains that it is a somewhat confusing and irrelevant addition to the stock of Buffy-inspired books.	2004-07-05
US	39424751	R9A7W1CJTRAUW	0670036870	536057395	Waters Luminous and Deep	Books	5	3	3	N	N	"We Shall Go a Voyaging - Call the Boat..."	Meredith Ann Pierce is definitely one of my favourite authors: her style, her narrative voice and her subject matter all appeal to me at the highest level, and after devouring all her other books I was incredibly thankful to find that she'd been published once more. Then I discovered that it was an anthology of short stories: if you've read any of my other reviews you'll know that I am not that fond of short stories: novels are more meaty and interesting to me. But in Pierce's hands, I had nothing to worry about. In \\"Waters Luminous and Deep\\" she presents eight pieces of writing that all surround the element of water, whether it be sea water, rain water, ice, snow, tears, or the still deep water at the bottom of a well. With her rich, beautiful imagery and her ability to take old fairytales and reshape them into something new and original, this anthology is a must-read for anyone who loves fantasy, folklore, legends or just storytelling at its best.<br />\\"Night Voyage\\" is the prelude to the book - a dreamy and quiet fragment that sets the mood and the theme of the rest of the book, of two children's experiences with the sea and moon.<br />\\"The Fall of Ys\\" is Pierce's retelling of the legend of Ys, a kingdom that sunk due to the sorcerous evils of the King's daughter (in some versions called Dahud, but here Myramond) and her father's noble/tragic decision to let her drown. Pierce takes a different slant on the story however, suggesting that King Gralond was the antagonist, his daughter the innocent, and the sea working not as a ravaging force of nature, but as an act of justice. Pierce also melds old tales of drowned suitors in the wave's crests and the Avalon-like priestesses of the sea-isles.<br />\\"Where the Wild Geese Go\\" is based on five pen-and-ink drawings (sadly not included) that touched Pierce's imagination and formed a story. A story reminiscent of Hans Christian Anderson's \\"The Snow Queen\\", given that it concerns a young girl on a quest through a wintry landscape. Truzjka is sent by her grandmother into the wild in order to ease her heart's desire to know where the wild geese fly, and in Pierce's hands the usual fairytale obstacles and characters that Truzjka meets on the way become fresh and original.<br />\\"Icerose\\" fits in the \\"Snow Queen\\" element that was missing from the previous story with the inclusion of a figure known as the Icewitch. In order to return summer to the world Gunther and Demian set forth to retrieve the Icerose from the terrible Icewitch's frigid grip. Pierce melds stunning imagery (a swan frozen in the midst of taking flight) and her eye for detail: as the heroes sit by the fire, tiny black salamanders scuttle through it and into the night. This is one of my favourites, and brilliantly showcases Pierce's ability to tell new stories that *feel* like ancient tales.<br />\\"Rafiddilee\\" was written when Pierce was only fourteen years old: it was the story that told her she was a writer, and tells of a mute dwarf that comes into the service of his beloved queen, and their years together before her mind strays toward the prospect of a husband. Sad, grim and bittersweet, you can tell by the angst and tragedy that a teenager wrote it! Still, it is a remarkable feat for such a young person, and a beautifully told story.<br />\\"The Sea Hag\\" is perhaps the weakest story of the bunch: Pierce herself admits she isn't much of a humorist, and this attempt at comedy doesn't quite mesh. A young man takes to the life of piracy, but when the captain turns on him it would seem his only chance for survival lies with marrying a withered old sea hag. This story seemed stale for me because I was well aware of the myth on which it was based, and apart from a gender-switch, Pierce takes little effort to move away from it: that of the \\"Loathly Lady\\" of Arthurian lore, who demands the answer to a riddle: what is it that women most desire?<br />However, things pick up once more with \\"The Frogskin Slippers\\", which gets back toher more subtle technique of recognisable elements in a new light: this time she takes the idea of the Frog Prince, and here her humour is much more successful and natural. Rose is the daughter of her tyrannical mother, the mistress of Elverston Hall. When she rescues a small frog, she is visited nightly by a handsome prince named Rane, who whisks her away to a faery ball - and with her own fairy godmother and a pair of frogskin slippers, Rose begins to reach for the day when she is free of her stifling world.<br />The book ends with \\"Rampion\\", a novella concerning Alia, a young girl living on a tiny dull island, who discovers her half-sister Sif and the cruelty of her own father. Here Pierce has the time to create a larger world and more complex characters, with a story that stretches over several years and a nice twist at the end.<br />All in all a fantastic collection, and all I can hope for now is that the rest of the stories that Pierce mentions in her introduction are one day published!her more subtle technique of recognisable elements in a new light: this time she takes the idea of the Frog Prince, and here her humour is much more successful and natural.

In previous books they have gained some general knowledge on how to deal with these faeries (which is based on real fairy folklore) thanks to the \\"Field Guide to Faeries\\", written by their great uncle Arthur.<br />The \\"Ironwood Tree\\" delivers on the previous book's promise of dwarfs, with a journey underground and the first appearance of Mulgarath the ogre, mentioned in \\"Lucinda's Secret\\". When the twins accompany their mother to Mallory's fencing meet, Jared notices a young girl rummaging through his sister's bag. Going to investigate, Jared confronts a shape-shifting faerie that immediately turns into a terrified little boy when Jared threatens him with a knife - just in time for the principal to catch him.<br />Despite being faced with suspension, the twins discover that Mallory has been kidnapped by the dwarfs, and must venture into the abandoned quarry in order to rescue her. From there comes encounters with the dwarf king, the hoardes of dwarfin treasure, an enchanted Mallory, a knocker, and finally the terrible Mulgarath, leaving this particular reader longing for book five.<br />After a brief lull in the action in \\"Lucinda's Secret\\" (which was still a good read) Holly Black picks up the action once more, with more faery encounters, captures and escapes, and a rather bloody final chapter. The detail of the dwarf kingdom is wonderful, with a myraid of mechanics and treasures that the dwarfs have created (including the famed Ironwood Tree), and Black effortlessly sprinkles in touches of fascinating faery lore. Some things I didn't quite agree with: the dwarfs prove themselves to be quite stupid, considering - 1. They didn't check to see if they had the real Field Guide, 2. They let the twins escape so easily from their cage, and 3. they actually gave weapons to Mulgarath (and their reasons for allying themselves with him are never explained). I've always quite liked dwarfs in the fantasy genre, but these ones are just too idiotic to be likeable.<br />Also, I was a little disappointed in the children's mother: I would like to think that if my child was accused of threatening a younger child and he pleaded innocent, I would give him the benefit of the doubt and stick up for him. Mrs Grace however is all to ready to believe that her son would do such a thing - shame on her!<br />However, Tony DiTerlizzi's illustrations just keep getting better and better. The shapeshifter in particular is downright creepy - and Mulgarath is just fantastic. He is obviously evil, but the skill of DiTerlizzi's pen makes you appreciate the work that went into creating him: he is huge, magnificent and regal - and therefore looks quite appealing. The dwarfs are fairly unoriginal in their appearence (short, squat, long beards, etc), but their treasure trove and the frog/bug-like knocker is wonderful.<br />Even though there sadly are some characters missing (Thimbletack, Hogsqueal, Byron the griffin), there is a hint as to a mystery character that the goblins have captive, and what the children will have to do in order to win the day. I can't wait for book five: \\"The Wrath of Mulgarath.\\"ns to Mulgarath (and their reasons for allying themselves with him are never explained).

But when I saw the calibre of the authors presented here, I had to have a read: Lloyd Alexander, Garth Nix, Diana Wynne Jones, Meredith Ann Pierce, Patricia McKillip - wow! I adore all these authors, but had never experienced any of them in short story format. Maybe because my expectations were too high, or maybe because of my bias against short stories, reading became a little tedious after a while, and though I never regret reading a book, I doubt I'll be picking up this particular anthology again. However, there are some gems spotted in amongst them, and the skill of the authors involved is to be recommended:<br />\\"Cotillion\\" Delia Sherman - a retelling of the Tam Lin tale in 1960's New York, with a few tweakings and an unfortunate case of love at first sight. Beautiful imagery though.<br />\\"The Baby in the Night Deposit Box\\" Megan Whalen Turner - a comic-fantasy tale of a bank that takes an abandoned baby into its care, and the evil enchantress than turns up many years later to \\"withdraw her niece\\".<br />\\"Beauty\\" Sherwood Smith - a 'sequel' of sorts to \\"Crown Duel\\", which was unbeknownst to me when I began reading it. Ironically enough, I had checked out \\"Crown Duel\\" from the library at the same time as this anthology and now know how the story ends. Sigh.<br />\\"Mariposa\\" Nancy Springer - a nice little story about a young woman searching for her soul, left in the care of the fishes that swim in the stream at her childhood home.<br />\\"Max Mondrosch\\" Lloyd Alexander - don't expect Alexander's usual fantasy-comic fare in this story: it's a dark, disturbing tale of a man who does everything he can to succeed, and *still* fails.<br />\\"The Fall of Ys\\" Meredith Ann Pierce - one of my very favourite authors retells the legend of sunken Ys from a slightly more feminist point of view. Pierce's stories are always worth while, and her name was the main reason why I picked up this book.<br />\\"Medusa\\" Michael Cadnum - a dreamy version of the Medusa myth, more poetry than prose, with a poignant ending.<br />\\"The Black Fox\\" Emma Bull and Charles Vess - the adaptation of an old English ballad into comic book form, in which a hunting party comes across a demonic black fox...or is it?<br />\\"Byndley\\" Patricia A. McKillip - again, another author that doesn't disappoint, weaving her extraordinary language about a wizard trying to find his way back into Faery, to return something that he once stole.<br />\\"The Lady of the Ice Garden\\" Kara Dalkey - try and see how long it takes you to see what European fairytale Dalkey has retold in a Japanese setting. A great idea, though with a rather unexpected ending for her young hero and heroine.<br />\\"Hope Chest\\" Garth Nix - as usual his descriptions are detailed and intricate, but the story (a blend of Western and fantasy) rather baffled me, and left about a thousand questions unanswered. Sorry Nix, I love your \\"Old Kingdom\\" trilogy, but this just wasn't my cup of tea.<br />\\"Chasing the Wind\\" Elizabeth E. Wein - definitely the odd one out, considering that this isn't even a fantasy story. A young girl travels over Africa to join her missionary parents.<br />\\"Little Dot\\" Diana Wynne Jones - quintessential DWJ fare: bizarre magics, mythological gods and creatures brought into the modern world, quirky humour, and lots and lots of cats. J. K. Rowling has *definitely* read DWJ.<br />\\"Remember Me\\" Nancy Farmer - a nice, but kinda forgettable story of a changeling child and her misunderstanding family.<br />\\"Flotsam\\" Nina Kiriki Hoffman - a short story that perhaps tries to squish too much into it: a grieving family, an otherworldly boy, the magical backstory that gives explanation for why he's there, how the family deals with the magics, a high-school crush, and how they get him back home again.<br />\\"The Flying Woman\\" Laurel Winter - outof all the stories, this one has the most potential for being expanded into a book. After being abandoned on a desert island (presumably due to their powers) two children fend for themselves until they find a mysterious winged woman washed up on the shore.<br />The editor is Sharyn November (who I've never heard of before!) and after each story is a comment from the author on the stories that they've presented here. Oh, and just in case you get the wrong idea: none of them are about Firebirds - that's the name of the imprint. Looking over my list, I concur that this *is* a decent series of stories, and for those that enjoy the authors or the format, then its well worth exploring.of all the stories, this one has the most potential for being expanded into a book.

A peace delegation including Alanna the Lioness, the Gareths and other nobles from Tortall have been sent to the hot, swampy Charthak Empire in order to negotiate peace with the war-mongering Emperor Ozorne. With them is Numair, once the Emperor's best friend and now his sworn enemy, Daine, who has been chosen to come in order to heal the Emperor's beloved and sickly birds, and Kitten the baby-dragon, whom the Emperor is intensely curious about.<br />Although the negotiations intensely important to Tortall, considering that war with Charthak is unimaginable (especially since it is believed that it was Ozourne that released the Immortals back into the human realms), everyone is optimistic about the success of restoring peace. So long as nothing untoward happens - but of course Daine specialises in stirring up trouble whether she wants to or not. Before she even sets foot on Charthaki soil she is visited by her Badger-god mentor who scolds her for leaving her homeland and gives her a dire warning: \\"The gods have lost patience with the Emperor.\\"<br />But the delegation has no chance of turning back now, and soon Daine is mingling with Prince Kaddar, the heir to the throne, Lindhall Reed, Numair's old tutor, and the Emperor himself. And yet their is more going on in Charthak - the Stormwing Rikash has returned and seems to have his own agenda with the Emperor and a snappish old slave woman who is certainly not what she seems has a special gift for Daine...<br />The Emperor seems to have neglected the gods and is now misinterpreting their potent signs, a mistake that might lead Numair into terrible danger. Once more Daine is called upon to use her Wild Magic, finding in it a strength and power that is almost unimaginable.<br />\\"The Emperor Mage\\", despite the fact that the previous two books in the series are necessary to understand it, is a truly excellent read. For the first time we go across the inland sea to Charthak, and Pierce constructs the empire with astonishing detail and colour: everything from army regulations to the type of jewellery that the nobles wear is included in such a way that doesn't feel encyclopedic or boring. The palace is especially beautiful, from the magnificent statues, to the Hall of Bones, to the aviary and menagerie.<br />The characters are equally fascinating: the distant threat that was the Emperor in the previous books is now brought up close and personal - and to my surprise he is initially quite charming! Likewise, the Graveyard Hag is a delight, and Zek the pygmy marmoset is so gorgeous, it left me wanting one. Daine and Numair continue to grow into more complex and intriguing characters (look out for the first hints of something *else* going on between them), and although I dearly missed Onua and Cloud, Kitten is beguiling enough to hold her own.<br />There are a few silly one liners (\\"how nice for us - we can have a reunion\\" and \\"that is the greatest understatement I've ever heard in my life\\"), but the fantastic story overcompensates for this. As it is, \\"The Emperor Mage\\" is the first book I've ever read that kept me up until three in the morning, frantically reading under the covers.<br />\\"The Emperor Mage\\", despite the fact that the previous two books in the series are necessary to understand it, is a truly excellent read.

It begins right where the last book ended, several months after Tess and her Switcher-friend Kevin have destroyed the terrible krools, with Kevin alighting at her bedroom window in his last (and now permanent) form: a glorious phoenix. It may be necessary to have read \\"Switchers\\" beforehand, just to sort out the characters, the background history and the abilities of Switching, as it is an important point to know that at the age of fifteen, a Switcher's powers disappear, and whatever form - human or animal - that they choose is theirs for the rest of their life.<br />But Tess's fifteenth birthday is not for a while yet, and instead she is enjoying the exhilaration and endless peacefulness of being a phoenix alongside Kevin. But there is another force at work - Tess's pet rat Algernon is being called forth by an unknown master, to dig alongside hundreds of rats in uncovering a mysterious stone artefact. Investigating in rat-form, Tess discovers a fellow Switcher named Martin, who has very different ideas on how to use his powers than Tess and Kevin ever had. Tess herself is intrigued, even attracted to Martin's interpretation of a Switcher's power, but is just as pulled toward Kevin and his newfound glory.<br />And then the zoo captures Kevin, and the phoenix becomes an instant attraction. People line up for hours in order to glimpse its beauty, rendering them almost drugged by its influence. But with the phoenix set to be sold to an American collector, Tess has only a limited time to release her friend before he's lost forever. With some enigmatic advice from a visiting Lizzie (the old woman who previously helped Tess and Kevin on their trip to the Artic), Tess must find a way to save Kevin and subdue Martin, all the while torn between them and the alternating choices that they embody.<br />\\"Midnight's Choice\\" is a good followup from \\"Switchers\\", though I must admit enjoying the first book a lot more. Kate Thompson continues building on the mythos of the Switchers and of Tess's internal growth, but for me at least all of the characters remain quite detached - I could never feel particularly close or sympathetic toward them, and slow pacing in some areas doesn't help. Tess's parents in particular are confusing; I can't imagine any parents of a young teen letting her get away with half the stuff Tess does.<br />However, Tess is likeable enough, and unlike the krools of the previous book, the enemy she faces here is inside her own self. The duality of the phoenix and Martin is put to good use in examining the light and dark side to Tess herself, as is Tess's final decision on the matter. Although \\"Midnight's Choice\\" is not essential reading, those that do pick it up are likely to be interested enough to continue with \\"Wild Blood\\", the third and final book in the series.Choice\\" is a good followup from \\"Switchers\\", though I must admit enjoying the first book a lot more.

Pierce jumps straight into the story without hardly any background information, so if you are unfamiliar with the fantasy realm of Tortall, I very highly recommend that you don't begin your journey with this book: start with \\"Wild Magic\\", or even better \\"The Lioness Quartet\\", Pierce's first books concerning Tortall.<br />Daine and her mentor Numair have been sent abroad in order to investigate the disappearance of several of the Queen's Riders, and in doing so Daine receives contact from the Long Lake wolf pack - the animals that she once ran wild with when they helped her avenge her murdered family. Their call to her is for help: their home is under threat from humankind's mining and construction that is destroying the natural habitat, and desperate to help her friends, Daine convinces Numair to help them.<br />But by helping the wolves, the two of them uncover even more secrets: the rulers of Dunlath, Lady Yolane and her consort - and Numair's old classmate - Tristan, are plotting to usurp the thrones of King Jonathon and Queen Thayet, by bribing the war-mongering empire of Charthak with the black diamonds they are acquiring through the mining that cause the animals so much trouble. As you may have already guessed, it's up to Daine, her powers, and the animals to put a stop to all of this, resulting in a plan that is sure to excite all readers once they hear of it.<br />In the overall context of the \\"Immortals Quartet\\", \\"Wolf Speaker\\" is the least important - in fact you might be able to get away with not reading it with only minor confusion. But it is a great adventure, despite the somewhat cliched environmental issue at the heart of the book, and it drops little hints throughout as to Daine's parentage, her growing magical powers, her relationship with Numair and the growing threat of Charthak.<br />Pierce's range of characters is huge, from the animal kingdom (Flicker, Scrap, Sunclaw, Blueness, Rebel, Brokefang and the Long Lake pack) to the humans (Tait, Maura, Gissa, Belden) to the immortals (Tkaa, Iakoju, Rikash, and of course the Badger-god and Kitten the dragonet, that Daine rescued at the conclusion of the previous book). Each character is well drawn and realistic in their actions and motivations (though I dearly missed the absent Onua), and Pierce is clever enough to mix in shades of grey to her growing war, with the inclusion of Rikash the Stormwing who holds a brotherly affection for the young lady Maura.<br />The \\"Immortals Quartet\\" are the best books that Tamora Pierce has to offer, so make sure \\"The Emperor Mage\\" is on hand to continue Daine's journey.oughout as to Daine's parentage, her growing magical powers, her relationship with Numair and the growing threat of Charthak.<br />Pierce's range of characters is huge, from the animal kingdom (Flicker, Scrap, Sunclaw, Blueness, Rebel, Brokefang and the Long Lake pack) to the humans (Tait, Maura, Gissa, Belden) to the immortals (Tkaa, Iakoju, Rikash, and of course the Badger-god and Kitten the dragonet, that Daine rescued at the conclusion of the previous book).

Tess is a reasonably distant and lonely child, who takes long walks out into the forest and park lands each day, returning home each evening to somewhat bemused parents. They don't believe anything is seriously wrong with their child despite the fact she has no friends - they just think she's a loner that loves the outdoors. But it just so happens that Tess is *very* different from other teenagers, and harbors a secret that she keeps from every other person on the planet. She has had the ability from a very early age to change into any animal she desires, and her daily walks into the wilderness are due to her transformations and adventures in animal form. It is a wonderful life as a \\"Switcher\\", and she's not lonely - just alone.<br />Until one day, when a boy begins to follow her home from the bus station and utters some terrifying words: \\"I know who you are. I know what you can do...\\" Who is this elusive Kevin and what does he want from Tess? Terrified that the fellow Switcher will reveal her secret, and suspecting that the \\"help\\" that he asks for has something to do with the steadily growing cold front that is moving southwards from the north pole and destroying all human-life in its wake, Tess agrees to accompany him to someone who knows what's going on.<br />This someone is an old lady named Lizzie, a former Switcher who tells the children about krools - monstrous creatures that are slowly pulling the earth back into an ice age. Whilst dodging the police and the government airforces, Kevin and Tess take it upon themselves to use their shapeshifting powers to stop the krools. But a person's Switching abilities cease when one turns fifteen, and Kevin's birthday is steadily approaching...<br />\\"Switchers\\" is a book that was initially is difficult to get into. The idea of people changing into animals is a well-trod path in children's literature, and for a long while it seemed that this was just another rehash of what has gone before. Tess and Kevin are a little difficult to connect with - both are quite distant, and it's rather implausible that Tess would choose to leave her home and her parents in order to follow someone she barely knows to an unknown destination. Lizzie is also a bit of a tired cliche (crazy old lady with lots of cats) and there are a few scenes that are unnecessary or stretch on a bit to long (Tess and Kevin's escapades as goats, for example).<br />But the book drastically improves as time goes on. The \\"Switcher\\" device is put to excellent use as the story continues, with the children instigating their powers to travel swiftly, hide from the police, to bear the terrible Artic cold and to finally defeat the krools and escape human bombing - each transformation is more ingenious than the last. To tell would be spoiling it - half the fun of this book is realising what great plan the children will come up with next.<br />So although you may be dubious at first, stick with it as \\"Switchers\\" and its two sequels \\"Midnight's Choice\\" and \\"Wild Blood\\" are immensely satisfying and rewarding, just below the likes of J. K. Rowling, C. S. Lewis and Lloyd Alexander, but on the shelf next to Tanith Lee, Sherwood Smith, Nancy Springer and other fantasy authors of this calibre.fficult to connect with - both are quite distant, and it's rather implausible that Tess would choose to leave her home and her parents in order to follow someone she barely knows to an unknown destination.

There Kaye's past swiftly catches up to her: as a child she was on familiar terms with the faery creatures of the woods and rivers, and now she finds her life tangled up in their magic as ever before. After rescuing a handsome knight Roiben, and meeting once more with her tiny faery friends Spike and Lutie, Kaye herself finds that she has a part to play in the rivalry between the two faery courts: the Seelie and the Unseelie Court. Caught directly between the two, Kaye realises that her heritage is certainly not what she thought it was, and that due to the circumstances of her birth she is the perfect candidate for the \\"tithe\\" of the title - the sacrifice planned to subdue the Seelie court into submission.<br />Caught between the dark, magical world of the faeries, and the equally dark and dangerous realm of teenage angst, Kaye's story is packed full of interesting ideas, vivid imagery, traditional faerie lore and an intriguing modern edge to all the proceedings.<br />In terms of heroines, Kaye does not quite measure up - sure she's spunky, determined and energetic, but she also smokes, swears, shoplifts and already initiated to the faery world when we first meet her, making her rather foreign most of the teenagers that bother to read books - its difficult to relate to her let alone *like* her very much. In fact, most of the characters in the novel are rather two-dimensional: Roiben is your typical dangerous, tortured-soul black knight, Lutie and Spike are undeveloped and hardly present, Janet is the typical best-friend that falls to the \\"best-friend cliche\\" of all suspense novels, and Kaye's mother Ellen is neglectful to the point of abuse: most of Kaye's thoughts on her mother involve how much she throws up, and she barely blinks an eye when she discovers her daughter shared her room with a strange boy all night.<br /><br />Likewise there is some just plain sloppy writing used in areas - for instance Roiben gives Kaye some vital information in order to save her life...but instead of just telling her what she needs to do, he tells her in the form of a riddle - why?! And as mentioned by the editorial reviewer, some of the descriptions are bad, unnecessary, or both: \\"Corny got up, scratching his balls through once-white briefs.\\" Eww[...] Did we really need to know that?<br /><br />But ultimately, what's good about this book compensates for the bad - the atmosphere and descriptions of the faery world are great, and Black creates its inhabitants with zest and imagination: \\"a long nosed woman with freckles and ears like a jackal's juggled pinecones\\", \\"a goat-footed poetess\\", and \\"a huge creature with bat wings and limbs like stilts sat atop a table and lapped at a beaten copper bowl of cream.\\" Each one of these tiny portraits paints a vivid world - there is a story lurking behind each one, just begging to be explored!<br />A huge plus for me was the portrayal of the faeries as tricky, malevolent, dangerous creatures. Since the Victorian interest in fairies, the beings have since then retained little of their former potency, instead being portrayed as cute, petticoated, rainbow-winged little girls with sparkly wands. But now it seems the darker side is returning thanks to the efforts of Brian Froud, Terri Windling, and now Holly Black. I hope the trend continues and that eventually all memories of Enid Blyton's fairies are forgotten. Black puts ancient faery lore to good use: the raths and hollow hills, the kelpie, the intoxicating faery food, the use of glamour, the changelings, and of course the sinister Tithe itself.<br />A nice touch was that Roiben used 'ye olde language-talke' whilst Kaye spoke like a modern day teen, and the comparison made between the faery realms and the world of the adolescence was great - is the wild and exciting faeryland really that different from the pulsating, neon world of teenage raves and parties? The faeries infiltration of the Halloween party is particularly inspired. A worthwhile read and a good effort for a new novelist, but I am much prefering Holly Black's \\"Spiderwick Chronicles,\\" despite the fact they are written for a younger audience.s and the world of the adolescence was great - is the wild and exciting faeryland really that different from the pulsating, neon world of teenage raves and parties?

Previously, the books were predominantly love stories between humans and Night World members, but \\"Huntress\\" is the book where things begin to get a bit more interesting...<br />Jez Redfern is confident in her abilities and her life - she spends her nights hunting down humans with her gang for fun, and alternatively flirting/fighting with her second-in-command Morgead Blackthorn. But then a vision disrupts this life forever: she is not a full-blooded vampire, but the daughter of a vampiric father and a human mother. As this knowledge endangers her very life, she abandons her gang, joins the benevolent Circle Daybreak and goes to live with her human relatives.<br />Several years later, Jez is leading a double-life: attending school by day with her annoying cousin Clare, and hunting her former allies at night under the instructions of the Circle. On this particular night she arrives home (in trouble with her family once more) to find another member of Circle Daybreak in her room: Hugh Davis. Hugh gives her the most important mission yet: a prophecy has risen that describes four \\"Wild Powers\\" that are destined to stop the coming apocalypse at the turn of the millennium.<br />And why has Jez been chosen to find the first of these Wild Powers? - (whose clue to their identity is used for my review's title) - Because someone has come forward claiming knowledge of the first Wild Power, and it's none other than Morgead. She must return to her gang and reclaim leadership, all the time knowing that if her true identity is found out then her life would be forfeit. And there are other darker powers looking for the Wild Power...<br />\\"Huntress\\" is one of the most rewarding books in the \\"Night World\\" series, concerning a desperate search, family ties, identity issues, Night World politics, and a growing sense of doom as the apocalypse ticks closer. However, don't get too involved in the characters and their situation - L. J. Smith has never published the last book in this series \\"Strange Fate\\" that wraps up the entire story (but as the millenium has come and gone without a hitch, I think we can assume that the good guys were successful).<br />L.

We also get another retelling of the Night World ancient history that fits in nicely to what we already know about Hellewise/Maya/the dragons and all the other eras of history.<br />At times it feels a bit rushed - Jez has found out her secret and moved in with her human family at the end of three very short chapters, and I'm getting increasingly amused at the ages of the vampires: despite the fact that they are immortal, all of her lamia characters just *happen* to be either seventeen or eighteen years old - where are all the grown-ups?!doom as the apocalypse ticks closer.

US	39424751	R2OWFJJ81SR17R	0590680528	306916936	The Names Upon The Harp: Irish Myths And Legends	Books	4	9	9	N	N	"You and I Leave Names Upon the Harp..."	\\"The Names Upon the Harp\\" is a collection of Irish legends from the three main cycles set down by scholars to classify the ancient manuscripts that record the tales: the Mythological Cycle, the Ulster Cycle and the Fenian Cycle. As retold by Marie Heaney, she begins each part with an introduction to that particular cycle and then launches into her favourite stories from that area.<br />The Mythological Cycle concerns the Tuatha Da Danaan, who were some of the early occupants of Ireland who defeated the Fomorians and were later in turn defeated by the Milesians who drove them underground. Heaney thus includes the stories that best describe these two events: \\"Moytura\\" that recounts how the Fomorian Balor of the Evil Eye was killed by his grandson Lugh, and \\"The Children of Lir\\", who were changed into swans by their stepmother and forced to live on until the peal of a bell rang in the new faith.<br />The Ulster Cycle concerns the doings of King Conor Mac Nessa and his court at their home of Emain Macha, including \\"The Birth of Cuchulainn\\", the strongest warrior of all, \\"Bricriu's Feast\\", who attempted to cause competition and strife between the warriors, and \\"Deirdre of the Sorrows\\" who was the Irish version of Blodewynn, Gwynevere and Helen: a beautiful woman caught between the love of two men who eventually causes their downfall.<br />Lastly, the Finn Cycle is of the Fianna Warriors and the bloodline of their leader Finn Mac Cumhaill: \\"Finn and the Salmon of Knowledge\\" tells of his upbringing and the gaining of his wisdom, \\"The Enchanted Deer\\" tells of his love affair with Sadb, a beautiful woman cursed in the form of a deer, and \\"Oisin in the Land of Youth\\", the story of Finn's son who travels to Ti Na N-Og with his beloved, only to return back to Ireland to find many thousands of years have past. The Finn Cycle also includes a poem \\"Summer\\", translated from the Irish by Seamus Heaney.<br />Therefore, the book covers a wide range of the mythology canon of Ireland, but one wishes that there had been more to fill in the blanks between each myth - often fascinating characters and plot points are introduced only to fall by the wayside, and often drastically important stories are left out entirely: Cuchulainn's death for example. Likewise, although Heaney tells the stories adequately, there is no sense of age or importance in her narrative. The people and events are told straightforwardly, but there is no mystery, no poetry, no sense of the *timelessness* of these great stories. One senses that she wrote for the benefit of introducing children to the myths, but it becomes clear early on that these stories are definitely *not* suitable for young children.<br />P. J. Lynch uses watercolours to capture the images of the stories, and here is where the true strength of the book lies. I have always been a huge fan of this artist, and \\"The Names Upon the Harp\\" might just be his best work. The landscapes of Ireland are just what they should be: mysterious and dark, cold and misty, rock-strewn and lake-covered. But the people: Lynch manages to catch all of them - whether strong or weak, cunning or tragic, warriors or poets, each one is realised fully. A few crowning achievements are the bitter sadness of Deirdre as she looks out upon the snow, and the pain on Oisin's face as he embraces his father farewell. As seen in other books, Lynch also enjoys creating giants: here the headless Cu Roi and the monstrous Balor are so vivid that it might be a good idea to censor this book from the little ones. This seems like a good place to say that he isn't stingy about the use of blood and violence either.<br />All in all, this is a rewarding book that for good measure includes a pronunciation guide and a list of sources. If you like Irish myth, then there are no real complaints here, and if you are a fan of P. J. Lynch, or want to see some of his best work (if you like Alan Lee or John Howe, you'll definitely like P. J.) then look no further. \\"The Names Upon the Harp\\" is well worth the search, and definitely worth owning.mes Upon the Harp\\" is well worth the search, and definitely worth owning.	2004-05-17

Because I Loved You the Best"	\\"The Fury\\" is the third book in the \\"Vampire Diaries\\" saga by L. J. Smith, which really should have been the last in the series, but was followed up by an unfortunate and unneccessary sequel. But that belongs in another review, and \\"The Fury\\" is a reasonably satisfying wrap-up of the events begun in \\"The Awakening\\" and \\"The Struggle\\".<br />Elena Gilbert is in love with Stefan Salvatore, a vampire, but is also attracted to his brother Damon. Throughout the course of the first two books she has shared blood with both of them, which means that when she is driven by some unnatural force into the river she rises once more as a vampire after her human body has perished. The brothers hide her at a local house, planning to smuggle her out once the town has quietened down once more, but as soon as she awakens after a week-long slumber, Elena refuses. Now more than ever she is certain that a third Power is present at Fell's Church, endangering the citizens and the vampire brothers.<br />Along with her friends Meredith, Bonnie and Matt (who are privy to the secret of Elena's transformation), they begin investigating, and come up with a range of suspects. But whilst they continue with their detective work, more and more dangerous things are happening in the small town: the domestic pet dogs attack the mourners at Elena's funeral service, and some of the townsfolk have decided to take matters into their own hands - blaming the newcomer Stefan for the supernatural trouble. But the real source lies deep within the vampire's past...<br />L. J. Smith brings together her entire cast to battle the evil, instigating all their talents (ie, Bonnie's psychic abilities, Alaric's vampire lore, Meredith's leadership, Damon's shapeshifting), and then splits them up in order for the teenagers to defend the school students at the prom, protect Elena's family and go up against the third Power in a satisfying conclusion to the story with an unexpected twist and death. The tension that was building up in the first two books is finally paid off, though most readers wishing for a happy ending will be sadly disappointed.<br />L. J. Smith unfortunately leaves several plot threads dangling - she never fully wraps up the motivations behind Robert's actions, nor why it looked as though he knew what was going to happen with the dogs outside the church - presumably it was instinct, but she might have told us that! Furthermore, I was expecting a plot twist in the character of Ms Flowers - in this and the previous book the teenagers see her leaning against the window, refusing to help them when they call, and I suspected that somebody had killed her and propped her body up against the window. Nope. She was apparently just a crazy old lady.<br />There are some devices that L. J. uses that get rather annoying, and which reminded me of R. L. Stine - both of them would end chapters on tense, dramatic sentences, only for them to come to absolutely nothing, rendering them silly and melodramatic. For instance: when Stefan is being attacked, Smith ends the chapter with \\"A white hand reached out of the darkness and knocked the rifle away...Elena had arrived\\". Whoohoo, is she finally about to beat up someone? No, the tension drains away with the arrival of Alaric. Later on, when Elena and the brothers are at the mercy of the Power, it tempts Damon with an alliance: \\"Oh God, no, Elena thought. Please no. Slowly, Damon smiled\\". Oh heck, is Damon going to turn on them? Or perhaps only pretend to in order to get free? Again, the drama is drained away as Damon refuses. After a while these sentences on the chapters end would get annoying as well as disappointing.<br />Oh well, why am I complaining over a book that cost me three dollars in the local bookstore's bargain bin? On the whole, \\"The Fury\\" is the most worthwhile read in L. J. Smith's vampire series, but not in her entire collection of books. If you're searching for a book to give to a pre-teen female, then you can't go wrong with L. J. Smith - the only problem she has an annoying habit on un-necessarily dividing her stories into several volumes, and you'll have to track them all down to get the full picture.with L. J.

You're Evil!"	\\"The Struggle\\" is the second book in L.J. Smith's \\"Vampire Diaries\\" series, and like all middle books, it suffers from a sense of displacement. It begins in the centre of the story and it ends in the centre of the story, and so one needs both the previous book and the following one in order to make sense of it.<br />The premise is hopelessly melodramatic: the beautiful blonde Elena (what, you expected an L. J. Smith heroine that *wasn't* stunning?!) is caught between two vampire brothers, the angelic Stefan and the demonic Damon. Though she loves Stefan she is equally attracted to Damon, and I'm wincing whilst writing this, such is the corniness of the situation. Elena reminds the brothers of a girl they both sought after whilst they were human: the vampiric Katherine who Turned them both, but then killed herself when they wouldn't cease their feud. Now the triangle is replaying itself out once more in contemporary Fell's Church, but with a few differences, namely the presence of another Power wrecking havoc upon the citizens. At first Elena and Stefan think Damon is responsible for the attacks and other strange occurences, but mounting evidence leads them to believe otherwise...<br />The love-story is simply painful to behold, and I'm not sure what's worse: the love-lorn wide-eyed declarations of love between Stefan and Elena (\\"you've stolen my soul\\") or Damon's painful attempts at seducing her (\\"You can become a queen of shadows\\"). Smith is usually quite good at capturing every-day speech, but the dialogue of this book is abysmal.<br />But in the face of the awful love-story, there are other little plot strands to consider that keep \\"Vampire Diaries\\" from being a complete waste of time. Even though \\"The Struggle\\" isn't that important in the context of the entire series, the more mundane occurances hold one's interest. In the previous book, Elena's diary is stolen, which contained several crucial passages about Stefan's involvement in the attacks at Fell's Church. Now little notes are popping up, posting on notice boards, slipped into her bag, that quote Elena's own words back at her. Elena and her two closet friends Bonnie and Meredith suspect their ex-friend Caroline, and dread the fact that she's planning on reading out the diary at the Founding Day celebration.<br />In between hatching a plan to steal back the diary, there is a whole range of other problems that need to be dealt with: the previously attacked Vickie is now acting very strangely at school, a new teacher Alaric Saltzman is asking a lot of suspicious questions, Bonnie's prophesies continue to get more and more ominous and class bully Tyler Smallwood is also causing trouble amongst the students. To top it all off, Damon is prowling around, inviting himself to class functions and even Elena's house in the attempts to stir up trouble between the brothers.<br />It ends, of course, on a big cliffhanger, and I think it's fair to say that on the whole \\"The Vampire Diaries\\" are not L. J. Smith's best work (not that any of her work is high literature). For me personally, I like my vampires evil and dark - but Smith's vampires are technically the good guys, and have no sense of the massive weight of vampiric lore that surrounds the legend; instead they act too much like teenagers. Though the books are backed up by reasonably interesting sub-plots, and one can clearly see from the other reviews that pre-teens swoon over the books and characters, it's only a matter of time before they're looking back and wondering \\"what was I *thinking*?!\\" They're good books to take on holiday - quick, easy, entertaining reads that don't need too much brain-power to read, and are no big loss if they are misplaced.Now little notes are popping up, posting on notice boards, slipped into her bag, that quote Elena's own words back at her.

Like books concerning the King Arthur legends, the Trojan War as a subject for a book is rapidly becoming dull.<br />So it is refreshing to find now and again a book that deals with this subject, and is actually *interesting*, suspenseful and surprisingly good. Such is Caroline B. Cooney's \\"Goddess of Yesterday\\". Although all of the mythological details and events of the War are correct (at least as far as I could see), the author brings new personalities to well-known characters, thoughtful insights on blasphemy and the nature of gods, and a likeable young heroine that blends so easily into the events leading up to the War that one might be surprised not to find her mentioned in ancient sources!<br />Anaxandra is the beloved daughter of a chieftain father in a small rocky isle, taken away from her home and family as a tribute/hostage of King Nicander, who places her in his own household as a companion to his own crippled daughter Princess Callisto. Despite homesickness, Anaxandra adjust to her new life, only to have it shattered once more by pirates who plunder Siphnos. Thanks to an ingenious disguise, Anaxandra is the sole survivor, and when the ship bearing King Menelaus pulls in to investigate, she lies to ensure her future: telling the King of Sparta that she is the Princess Callisto.<br />Under this new identity, she is taken to Sparta where she mingles with the family of the king: his beautiful but dangerous wife Helen, his cheerful daughter Hermione, his two elder sons, and baby Pleisthenes. It is there of course, that the inevitable happens: Prince Paris of Troy arrives in Sparta, and when Menelaus is called away to his grandfather's funeral, Paris and Helen set sail once more for Troy...taking baby Pleisthenes and Anaxandra (again under a false identity in a bid to save Hermione's life) with them...<br />When retelling such a well-known story, it is impossible to change important events in the tale (scholars would get too stroppy), but the personalities of the people involved are always up for grabs. Cooney creates an interesting version of Helen, as a painfully beautiful demi-goddess, utterly cruel, cold, manipulating, and revelling in the blood of the soldiers who die for her sake. It's a shocking change from the usual somewhat reluctant follower of Paris, who would walk the walls in agony over the deaths below her. Hector and Andromache's characterisations I am less fond of: he's too heavy-set and gruff, and she's too frivolous and giggly. Cassandra, however is captured perfectly as the hysterical, but beloved princess in the tower, and Cooney instigates a very clever plot-twist in the details of her curse (that her prophesies are never believed), that caught me completely off-guard!<br />There are a few details that bothered me: Anaxandra often beseeches the deity that gives name to the book: 'the goddess of yesterday', but who this figure actually is and how she fits into the pantheon of Greek gods remains unknown. The same complaint lies with the use of Medusa as a \\"good-luck charm\\", and did anyone else think that Anaxandra's romance with Euneas was a little abrupt? One horse ride and she's in love?<br />Furthermore, there are alot of plot threads left hanging - does Anaxandra meet up with Euneas again? Cassandra hints that her parents are still looking for her - so does she ever meet them again? Does she have her revenge on the pirates of the twisted fish? And for someone who knows absolutely nothing about the Trojan War, they will be left dangling with absolutely no information on what happens to any of the characters - Cooney ends the book, so to speak, just when it seems likeit's beginning. An epilogue fills in these blanks, but I would have liked to hear it from Anaxandra's point of view (plus Cooney forgets to mentions that Aretha is eventually rescued by her grandsons after the sack of Troy).<br />But all in all, Caroline B. Cooney has written a clear, beautifully descriptive story of an engaging young woman caught up in events much larger than herself, as well as a reworking of the traditional myths, and a reasonably accurate depiction of ancient Greek life.

A young woman blossoming into adulthood, a handsome \\"knightly\\" love interest (often seeming too good to be true), a darker, more mysterious bad-boy to balance the 'good boy' that the protagonist is equally attracted to, an angelic best friend, and a beautiful, sensual female villain. In terms of storylines, a supernatural mystery will be mingled in with the usual troubles of adolescence, with a hefty dose of the coming of age narrative, a forbidden romance, a series of murders and other little subplots thrown in for good measure.<br />Yet as repetitive as Smith's books sometimes appear, their popularity and appeal cannot be denied. The author has a good ear for human connections and emotions, and can keep a story rolling along nicely, dropping clues to the mystery as she goes and juggling several threads of narrative without letting any fall to the way side or having any become un-neccessary or boring. And in terms of keeping her regular formula fresh, \\"The Secret Circle\\" is probably the trilogy that does so most effectively: managing to pull together many different plots and ideas into a coherent, interesting whole.<br />Cassie Blake is holidaying with her mother in Cape Cod, putting up with Portia Bainbridge and having a remarkable experience with a young man who she rescues from some local thugs, when her mother breaks her some drastic news: they are not going back home at the end of break, but returning to her mother's hometown New Salem, to live with Cassie's ailing and estranged grandmother. Life in the small town is not to Cassie's advantage: the other students do not simply ignore her, but *avoid* her, nasty surprises are left in her locker, and even the teachers seem to treat her with suspicion. To top it all off, a strange group of teenagers led by the beautiful Faye Chamberlain seem to have it in for our Cassie.<br />Yet it seems that Cassie is somehow linked to this odd club - they all live on the same road, and she is eventually befriended by the benevolent, lovely Diana Meade, cousin to Faye and leader of the group. From here she soon discovers that there are two opposing factions in town: the ordinary, often hostile 'out-siders', and the Club: a group of young witches who are the descendants of the real witches at Salem.<br />And of course, it is here that things get really complicated for young Cassie, with the advent of three major catalysts: the return of Diana's beloved boyfriend, who just happens to be the boy Cassie saved at Cape Cod and has fallen in love with; the discovery of a crystal skull that she suspects holds some evil power, and the death of one of the soon-to-be initiated witches, that leaves a place open in the coven for Cassie...<br />It's hardly strenuous reading, but Smith's myriad of plots and details come together in her most worth-while series of books. Though the main characters are hardly realistic (Faye in particular is a bit over-the-top - see her little performance in English class), they are *interesting*, as are their relationships to each other. Or should I say their *conflicts* with each other, as the struggles between opposing factions of the coven, the coven with the out-siders, the members of the love-triangle, and the entire cast with the malevolent black force are compulsive reading.<br />It does slip a few times, usually when Smith gets too caught up in her own cleverness, for instance, she seems to be very proud of the phrase \\"devastatingly witty remark\\" as she uses it no less than four times! Furthermore, it was painful to read the truly awful poems that Smith describes as \\"good\\". No self respecting author would ever blow their own trumpet over lines such as \\"But you'll die smiling/Then you'll be part of the fire too\\". And as always, her love scenes are just plain silly - are we really supposed to believe that Cassie is in love with Adam after justone meeting?!<br />So basically, Smith's books do have an expiry date for older readers - anyone over the age of fifteen will probably find them silly, but if you're gift-searching for book-loving female \\"tweens\\", then L. J. Smith is a good choice, and \\"The Secret Circle: \\"The Initiation\\" her most entertaining read - including of course \\"The Captive\\" and \\"The Power\\".t one meeting?!<br />So basically, Smith's books do have an expiry date for older readers - anyone over the age of fifteen will probably find them silly, but if you're gift-searching for book-loving female \\"tweens\\", then L.

Despite the horrid sequels and the even worse television series that Michael Ende desperately tried to prevent in the last years of his life, Wolfgang Peterson's first attempt at bringing the book to the big screen was successful and popular. However, fans of the book will know that it only records the first part of the story - though Peterson compensates by telling us in the final segment of the film \\"Bastian had many more adventures before finally returning to the ordinary world. But that's another story...\\"<br />Since it's likely that you've seen the movie but not read the book, I highly recommend that you track down the original story - the movie stands on its own, but the book takes Bastian on a deeper and more dangerous journey into Fantastica and the inner regions of the soul, both adding detail into the movie's progression, and continuing into a larger and more fascinating adventure. Usually I always suggest reading books before watching any movies that they are based on, but in the case of \\"The Neverending Story\\" I make an exception - it is much better to scratch the surface of Ende's imagination in Peterson's very good interpretation of the book's first half, and then immerse yourself in the deeper book-within-a-book that Ende wrote, filled with adventure, intrigue, possibilities, mystery, thought-provoking ideas, beloved characters and probing into the depths of the human psyche.<br />Bastian Balthazar Bux is a rather tubby, unpopular victim of bullying at the school, with a deceased mother and a grieving father. His one consolation in life is books, his absolute passion. This love of stories and the magic they bring is the reason why he runs off with \\"The Neverending Story\\", the large volume he finds in Mr Coreander's old book store. Hiding himself in the attic of his school, he is soon intoxicated by the story that unfolds: a young warrior named Atreyu is chosen to seek out a cure for the deathly ill Child-like Empress, the ruler of the realm of Fantastica. In a quest filled with danger, and joined by the joyful luck-dragon Falkor, Atreyu must also avoid the growing threat of the mysterious \\"Nothing\\" - a force that is slowly eating up his world. What the Nothing truly is, what the elusive cure for the Empress is, as well as the nature of Fantastica and Bastian's role to play in its fate are mysteries gradually unfolded as he finds himself drawn deeper and deeper into the story. As it progresses, he finds himself wondering - could this particular story be *real*?<br />\\"The Neverending Story\\" is a work of true children's literature, and anyone who loves books for their own sakes and appreciates the importance of imagination is sure to find this a favourite. It is filled to the brim with memorable characters - Falkor, Atreyu, Engywook, Grograman, Yikka, and my personal favourite, the sinister, elusive Gmork, and touches on some of the most primitive questions of the human mind: life and death, hope and despair, existence and oblivion, the corruption of power, the basic needs of humanity...I could go on. In terms of sheer imagination and stark visual beauty, Ende rides to the top of the list along with Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, Phillip Pullman and other authors of this calibre.<br />If there is one issue that brings fault, it is that the original manuscript was written in German - therefore the rhyming verses that are prevalant in the text feel rather disjointed, with the translator struggling to convey the content of the German version (which would have been more fluid and rhythmic) whilst forcing rhyme into the English.<br />But this is irrelevant in the bigger picture, for this is a must read, just as Peterson's film is a must-watch. It is nothing less than a tragedy that money-hungry producers were allowed to exploit Ende's book into the appallingly badsequels and series, and I do my best to pretend that they don't exist. But here, fans of Peterson's movie, or those that have never heard of \\"The Neverending Story\\" before, will be well rewarded if they read Ende's book - the width and length that your imagination will expand after reading makes it well worth the effort.sequels and series, and I do my best to pretend that they don't exist.

In the final chapter of \\"Lirael\\", our four travellers Lirael, Sameth, Mogget and the Disreputable Dog have found sanctuary (albeit temporarily) at the Abhorsen's House where further revelations concerning Lirael and Sam's connection are discovered. With the missing pieces of her family's history now set into place, Lirael realises that the burden of Abhorsen-in-Waiting has now been placed on her.<br />Yet there is no time to dwell on that, as their enemies plans are now becoming clearer: the necromancer Hedge, along with his servant Chlorr have been raising two great silver hemispheres out of the earth. Sam's friend Nick is an unknowing accomplice in this activity, being the vessel of a tiny shard of silver from the spheres, a shard that contains within it the spirit of Orannis: the Destroyer. Orannis is the Ninth of the ancient \\"gods\\" (seven of which are remembered in the bells of the necromancers) that once shaped both the world and the benevolent Charter Magic, but as his name suggests he only tore down what the other raised up. And now, if the two hemispheres are joined, he will once more wreak havoc across the world.<br />And of course, it is up to Lirael and Sam to stop him: first by kidnapping Nick, and then in a desperate race to beat Hedge to the Lightening Farm in Ancelstierre, the non-magical kingdom across the border where Touchstone and Sabriel hit by hired assassins.<br />The pace doesn't let up for a moment in Nix's much anticipated conclusion, and if you've already invested a lot into the characters and situations of the first two books then it will be difficult to put down \\"Abhorsen\\" until the last page is read. Where \\"Sabriel\\" was an exciting read, and \\"Lirael\\" was fascinating and meandering, \\"Abhorsen\\" is quite simply explosive. There is barely a page where something drastic isn't happening, where our heroes aren't fighting, crawling, sneaking or running for dear life. It is quite simply an exhaustive read.<br />\\"Abhorsen\\" takes us further than we've ever gone into Death, all the way past the Ninth Gate, and I was pleased at how Nix presented the ultimate nature of Death. I had recently finished reading Phillip Pullmans \\"Amber Spyglass\\" and was rather depressed at his gloomy, despairing view of death, and Nix's realm of hideous zombies and dark rivers weren't really helping to cheer me up. However, without giving too much away, what Lirael finds in the final precinct of death is a place of both peace and future possibilities: nothing to dread at all.<br />Although Sabriel and Touchstone are not as prevalent as I would have liked, readers are treated to a nice reunion between all the major characters at the climax, and Mogget and the Dog's true identities are finally revealed. However, Nix leaves many questions unanswered and subplots left hanging - I (and many others) like to have a decent wrap-up to a book. \\"Abhorsen\\" however ends in the aftermath of the final battle, and I was dying to know what happens next! Where are Mogget and the Dog headed? Do Nick and Lirael fall in love? How does Lirael get on with her new family? What does the future hold? Furthermore, Mogget drops a tantalising little hint that reveals that Chlorr was once an Abhorsen, and yet nothing more is given on this subplot that just begs to be explored. The Old Kingdom itself is one of the most fascinating imaginary worlds I have come across, seeped in magic, mystery and history, and Nix often does little more than whet our imagination. Hopefully the quantity of dangling threads mean that he will eventually write more books on the gold mine that is the Old Kingdom - I hope so, as I'm eager to explore further.ndering, \\"Abhorsen\\" is quite simply explosive.

Set fourteen years after the events of \\"Sabriel\\", this book surrounds the actions of two main characters. Prince Sameth is the capable, but rather unexperienced son of Touchstone and Sabriel, overshadowed by his elder sister and disheartened by the fact that he is the next Abhorsen - the necromancer chosen to put to rest undead legions with the help of seven magical bells. Lirael is an orphan of the Clayr: clairvoyant allies of the Royal Family who live in a vast glacial community. Unlike all of her brethern, Lirael does not possess the Sight, and so spends her days as librarian, sometimes going for months on end without speaking to another human being.<br />But of course, fate has other ideas for these two - evil is once more abroad in the Old Kingdom. A terrible necromancer named Hedge is causing trouble in the West, beginning the first steps of a plan that threatens both the Clayr and the Royal Family - not to mention the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre, the non-magical country across the Wall. When Lirael unleashes and brings to life a mysterious magical dog known as the Disreputable Dog, and Sameth runs away from home in order to find his ignorant Ancelstierrean friend Nick who crosses the Wall, the two are thrown into the path of Hedge and so destined to stop his evil. And there is yet more going on, a secret bond between Sameth and Lirael that they are unaware of, but need to discover if they are to understand what is truly expected of them.<br />Once more Garth Nix has written an amazing book: a rich, mysterious fantasy world, an intriguing, twisting plot, strong and realistic characterisation... Nix really is a master at all of these areas. The Old Kingdom has been added upon, especially in regards to the Clayr, who were just distant allies in \\"Sabriel\\". Now we get to see deep inside their home and customs, including the huge library that is surely every book-lovers dream: not just a place of endless levels of manuscripts but even deeper chambers of monsters, magic, artifacts, underground gardens, buriel chambers...I could have wandered in there with Lirael forever.<br />Lirael and Sameth are very different from Sabriel as protagonists: where Sabriel was confident, strong and focused, Sameth and Lirael are more hesitant about their chosen paths. In doing so, Nix has made them more realistic, but readers may miss the Nancy Drew-like qualities of Sabriel that made her such a popular heroine. I must say I had quite a soft spot for Sameth - unfortunatly some readers have dismissed him as a bit of a wimp, but I completely understood his fear over the huge responsibility that was placed over him, and as another reviewer pointed out, he is one of the few fantasy characters that is not just reluctant about his duties, but downright terrified of them! Either way, I found his fear easier to grasp than Lirael's suicidal decision to chuck herself off the Clayr glacier.<br />The Disreputable Dog and Mogget are the highlights of the story: their meeting was exactly what I expected it to be (throw a cat and a dog together in a boat and watch the fireworks!) and provide most of the comic relief in the story, whilst dropping a few clues that there is more to their identity than meets the eye. Mogget (my favourite) is introduced a little later than I would have liked, but is still the bad tempered, superior white cat that we all remember from \\"Sabriel\\".<br />Of course Touchstone and Sabriel aren't forgotten, and I thought it was a nice touch that their eldest daughter Ellimere was named after one of Sabriel's school friends that died at the end of the first book. However, I did catch one continuity error - in \\"Sabriel\\" Mogget called Sabriel's father 'Emeritus', but here he is named as 'Terciel'. Given that \\"Lirael\\" was written six years after \\"Sabriel\\" was published, its hardly surprising that this tiny detail was missed, but still...<br />Basically, \\"Lirael\\" is one of the best, most original fantasy books you can read, certainly up there with the likes of Rowling, Tolkien, Pullman and Lewis in terms of readablity and popularity. Be sure to read \\"Sabriel\\" first, and you'll definitely be reading for its sequel in a hurry.till...<br />Basically, \\"Lirael\\" is one of the best, most original fantasy books you can read, certainly up there with the likes of Rowling, Tolkien, Pullman and Lewis in terms of readablity and popularity.

Behan narrates in a jaunty-like prose that reminds one immensely of the language usually connected to stories from Ireland, and incorporates many of the usual fairytale components: a tricksy giant, a damsel in distress, enigmatic guides upon the road, a helpful talking animal, a threefold trial and a triad of brothers: two malevolent ones to the virtueous youngest.<br />The King of Ireland hears the sound of \\"heavenly music\\" in his kingdom, and promises half the land to whichever son manages to find its source. The two eldest, Neart and Ceart, take the oppurtunity to get rid of Art, the youngest, by lowering him down the hole from which the music appears to be coming from. Art however, is sincere in his wish to follow the music, and follows the tunnel connected to the dark hole, ushered on by three elderly men, each one older than the previous, each the son of the following one.<br />Art follows their advice to a beautiful garden, where a beautiful, magical stallion carries him through an equally beautiful garden. There he finds the music's source: the daughter of the King of Greece is held captive there, under the power of a huge and evil giant. Captured by the giant, Art agrees to his challenge: for three days the giant will hide, and if Art does not find him, he'll be killed. If by any change he does succeed, then it's Art's turn to hide whilst the giant seeks. Again, should Art fail, it will end in his death.<br />Helped by the Princess and the stallion Art takes up the challenge, leading to the most rewarding part of the book: the ingenius hiding places held by the two opponents. Here P. J. Lynch's always-stunning illustrations come into play. The bold yet delicate watercolours are a feast for the eye, and Lynch seems to be able to paint *anything*, from any angle, whether it be comical facial expressions, the giant's eye view of the world, or the cavernous tunnel where all the actions takes place. In particular, the expression of the Princess gesturing to her ring is priceless! I couldn't help but laugh at the perfect expression she wears of a person desparately trying to convey secret information without the antagonist realising she's doing so. The giant also is a great creation - menacing without being too terrifying.<br />Like most folklore heroes, Art relys more on the advice on helpful guides than his own devices (the stallion is solely responsible for his salvation) and the Princess, in her own words has: \\"been here for a year and a day and I can't get away from this old fellow until someone comes to rescue me.\\" Obviously the idea that such damsels could be their own rescuers had not yet reached fruitition, but Lynch's portrayal of her, with sparkling wit and humour makes her not a total loss as a female role model.<br />Despite some narrative faults, \\"The King of Ireland's Son\\" is a great addition to the bookshelf, especially for those with a love for folklore and fairytales that are brought to life with thoughtful, creative illustrations.thing*, from any angle, whether it be comical facial expressions, the giant's eye view of the world, or the cavernous tunnel where all the actions takes place.

But now he has gone missing, and after recieving his last gift to her (the necromancer's tools: a spelled sword and a bandolier of seven bells) Sabriel sets out into her homeland that she hardly knows in order to find him, and go up against the ancient evil that is steadily snaking over the land...<br />On her quest she comes up against a number of obstacles, both terrifying and fascinating, (but thankfully all serve a purpose and are not just there for their own sakes) and landscapes that are described so vividly they can be seen with perfect clarity in the mind's eye.

A further delight is the character of Mogget - the white cat that accompanies Sabriel, but is in many ways more of a hinderance (not to mention a danger) than a help.

For centuries there were the standard damsels in distress. Then with the wave of feminism came the stronger but still rather insipid \\"I'm spunky and spirited...but I *still* need to be rescued from captivity\\" female figure. But now come the women that have long been dormant - beginning with Tamora Pierce's heroines and Phillip Pullman's Lyra, Sabriel follows in their tradition of being intelligent, resourceful, brave, compassionate and in charge of her situation. It can't be just a coincidence that most of the people she rescues in her travels are male!<br />Though I would love to give \\"Sabriel\\" five stars, I have to take a point off for the instigation of two of the most cliched and over-used fantasy plot developments of all time - that of the \\"misplaced royal heir\\" and the \\"true love\\" senario. When Sabriel rescues Touchstone he claims himself to be one of the guards of the royal family of the Old Kingdom. Don't think I'm spoiling anything for you when I say he *isn't*, as his \\"secret identity\\" is almost painfully obvious. Likewise, the romance between him and Sabriel is sudden to say the least, with them both awkwardly confessing their feelings near the end of the book.

But now come the women that have long been dormant - beginning with Tamora Pierce's heroines and Phillip Pullman's Lyra, Sabriel follows in their tradition of being intelligent, resourceful, brave, compassionate and in charge of her situation. It can't be just a coincidence that most of the people she rescues in her travels are male!<br />Though I would love to give \\"Sabriel\\" five stars, I have to take a point off for the instigation of two of the most cliched and over-used fantasy plot developments of all time - that of the \\"misplaced royal heir\\" and the \\"true love\\" senario. When Sabriel rescues Touchstone he claims himself to be one of the guards of the royal family of the Old Kingdom. Don't think I'm spoiling anything for you when I say he *isn't*, as his \\"secret identity\\" is almost painfully obvious. Likewise, the romance between himand Sabriel is sudden to say the least, with them both awkwardly confessing their feelings near the end of the book. Nix could have gotten away with using one of these plot lines, but both together?...No.<br />Despite this however, \\"Sabriel\\" is intoxicating reading, and very difficult to put down. Combining the genre of fantasy with touches of horror, Nix's \\"Old Kingdom\\" trilogy must be brought, not borrowed! Look out for a sequel that gets even better than this - \\"Lirael\\", followed with the third installment \\"Abhorsen.\\"	2004-03-22

Stockton first wrote \\"The Bee-Man of Orn\\", a strange blend of folktale and original fairy story back in 1964, with illustrations by Maurice Sendak. Although good, Sendak's illustrations were bright and kooky, high-lighting the comic aspects of the story, rather than the deeper more thoughtful elements. On the whole, I prefer this new edition, with new illustrations by P. J. Lynch that create a more realistic and folktale-like setting.<br />The Bee-Man lives in a small hut in the countryside that has been so covered over by the honeycomb of his friends the bees that it resembles more of a hive. He's happy there, but is instantly alarmed by the arrival of a young Sorcerer, who informs him that his strange way of living has come about due to the fact that he's been *transformed*. Transformed from what? The Sorcerer doesn't know, but now the Bee-Man is determined to find out. Gathering a small hive of bees that he wears on his back, he begins his journey to find out what he once was, eventually coming to the mountains that hold the caves of dragons...<br />Meeting up with a Languid Youth who wants to be more energetic, the two enter the caves and find something there that will solve *both* their problems. The story ends on not one but two notes of the laughable actions of Fate and inevitabilty, leaving the story with a satisfying ending and a topic open for more discussion. How many children's books do you know that do *that*?<br />The story is charming and P. J. Lynch's illustrations are fantastic. His watercolours brilliantly convey the glorious green world of Orn and the expressive lined faces of the people within it. The pages of the book are large and glossy - giving his work their best chance to shine, and do so to their full effect in the scenes of open country and lofty caverns. If anyone has seen his illustrations in \\"Catkin\\", they'll know how good he is at underground scenes, and here they're even better: misty depths, fiery walls and rocky textures all seen real enough to touch.<br />Although the Languid Youth looks a bit too droopy to me, the Bee-Man is perfect in both his incarnations, and on the whole, Lynch's work better matches the text. Together, the story and the illustrations have an almost Tolkien flavour to them: the story could easily belong to \\"Tales from the Perilous Realm\\" or one of Middle-Earth's folktales, and I always recommend people to P. J. Lynch if they like the art of Alan Lee and John Howe.

I'm Going to Tell You Everything"	Finally, after what seems like centuries of waiting, \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\" is available! And was it worth the wait? The answer is a resounding YES! With everything one has come to expect from J. K. Rowling, the wizarding world is expanded and the tension heightens as Harry Potter and his friends face new and even more difficult challenges in what is the darkest book yet in the series.<br />After a nearly an entire summer of waiting, Harry is frustrated and nearly frantic with the lack of news that has come forth in regard to the newly risen Lord Voldemort, and it is soon apparent that \\"The Order of the Phoenix\\" has a very different tone than the previous books. There is no mischief making at the Dursleys, no shopping sprees in Diagon Alley, no joyful reunion with his friends - everything here has a sense of tension bordering on desparation as Harry is whisked away from the Dursleys to his godfather Sirius's house after an attack on himself and his cousin by two grim Dementors.<br />The darkening of the plot line continues even into the personality of Harry himself, as Rowling highlights his shortcomings and his potential for failure with his steadily growing frustration, impatience, resentment toward his friends and even a few touches of arrogance - after all, hasn't it been *he* who has saved the day so often in the past? And yet on top of all this, he must still make room for the less magical components of his life - his missing out on becoming a Prefect, the dreaded end of year exams, and the terror of coming face to face with your crush. And what do his new dreams mean - of walking down an empty corridor toward a multitude of doors at its end?<br />In a change that some readers may not have been expecting after the conclusion of \\"the Goblet of Fire\\", the main enemy of \\"the Order of the Phoenix\\" is not Voldemort at all, but the Ministry of Magic, staunch in its belief that Voldemort has not returned and that Harry is simply an hallucinating attention-seeker. Led by Cornelius Fudge, believing that Dumbledore is a threat to his position, and helped by an estranged Percy Weasley, the Ministry is determined to make things as difficult as possible for the Order of the Phoenix by positioning a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher amoung the ranks at Hogwarts: one Dolores Umbridge. Using all the wiles of propaganda, manipulation, corporeal punishment and backing from a stronger source, this infuriating woman imposes a strict, regimented regime on staff and students alike, turning Hogwarts into the worst of dictatorships. It is an incredibly well-written allegory on the workings of tyranny, dictatorship and control in our own world, both past and present, and of the evils of a number of social afflictions: prejudice, segregation, fixed justice systems, media frenzy, secret police, withholding of information - everything that could go wrong with a government or administration of any sort is incapsulated here in the Ministry of Magic's attitude.<br />As you may have already guessed, Harry, Ron and Hermione are not going to take this sort of restrictions on their beloved Hogwarts sitting down, and soon are fighting fire with fire, whether it be the the formation of \\"Dumbledore's Army\\", the blackmailing of ex-reporter Rita Skeeter to get Harry's story into the open, the maliciousness of Peeves put to good use, or the heightened and increasingly elaborate pranks of Fred and George Weasley. When the students decide to take back the school, it results in some of the funniest comic sequences I have ever read - J. K. Rowling's sense of humour is hilarious!<br />Female readers are now in for a treat - if there has been one critism posed at the Harry Potter books, it is the lack of strong females characters. Though there are some disagreements to this, it must be noted that with the expection of Hermione and McGonagall, all the major players in the books are male: Dumbledore, Harry, Ron, Sirius, Snape, Lupin, Dobby,Hagrid, Malfoy...but now a new range of females have been ushered forward. Older characters such as Mrs Weasley, Ginny, Cho Chang and McGonagall play larger roles than previously, while new females from all walks of life make their first appearences - Nymphalia Tonks, the shape-shifting Order member, Bellatrix Lestrange, the evil Death Eater, and of course the Ministry member Dolores Umbride, a character so infuriating you'll be wanting to throttle your book.<br />In many ways \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" is vastly different from its predecessors: Hogwarts is no longer the centre of the action, as the Order members are 'out there' doing battle with Voldemort, the tone and content is much darker and complex, and there is a lot less involvement in the plot from major characters - Dumbledore, Hagrid, Malfoy and Dobby do not appear as often as they usually have. Likewise, there is no \\"whodunnit\\" or mystery to unravel as in previous installations; whereas they all stand on their own as separate stories, \\"OotP\\" really needs the other books in order to be understood and ultimately feels like a \\"bridge\\" from \\"Goblet of Fire\\" to the upcoming 6th book.<br />But Rowling does bring us what she promised - a deeper look into the wizarding world (in particular the Ministry of Magic headquarters and St Mungo Hospital) and the re-arrival of many familiar faces - Lupin, Firenze, Mad-Eye Moody, and more.

US	39424751	R1IDUM70S3WYUU	0027927652	699884399	Oscar Wilde Stories for Children	Books	3	23	25	N	N	"Death is a Great Price to Pay for a Red Rose"	Basically, this collection of Oscar Wilde stories is a reasonably good collection of the man's fairytales, mixing a few old favourites with some new (or at least reasonably unknown) stories; some excellent, some strange, and some, well...not so good. P. J. Lynch is the illustrator, who in my opinion is a man who can do no wrong. Some of his best are not in fact the full page illustrations, but the small pictures at the beginning and end of each stories, beautifully simple and framed only by the white of the page.<br />\\"The Selfish Giant\\" is probably the most famous of all Wilde's children's stories, of the giant who forbade children to play in his beautiful garden, resulting in winter claiming it all year round. Only when he tears down his walls and permits the children to play does he find happiness, especially in the discovery of a particular little boy who one day comes to claim him for his own garden...<br />\\"The Nightingale and the Rose\\" is a beautiful, haunting poetic tale that doesn't really come across as a children's story in content and form. A small nightingale hears the sadness of a lovelorn student, whose beloved has promised to dance with him if he brings her a red rose. Since none are in the garden, the Nightingale sacrifices herself in order to present him with one, singing of love in the moonlight whilst pressing herself up against the barren rosetree's thorn. No where is Wilde's stunning prose more obvious than here, as the Nightingale sings: \\"Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by Death,<br />of the Love that dies not in the tomb.\\" Just beautiful, and Lynch's garden scenes are striking - especially that of the Nightingale pressing her breast up against the thorn.<br />\\"The Devoted Friend\\" is an odd story-within-a-story as a Linnet tells a grouchy Water-rat about the friendship between an honest man named little Hans and a wealthy Miller: a friendship that is decidedly one-sided. Again, it is not entirely a cheerful children's story, as it ends with Hans' death and the Water-rat's complete inability to understand the moral. Overly long, the moral will probably also be lost on most readers, as its a strange ending to say the least. Illustrations are mainly pastoral scenes, but unfortunately don't compensate enough for the dull narrative.<br />\\"The Happy Prince\\" is the other of Wilde's most popular stories, and my definite favourite. The golden statue of the prince in the town is baffled by the reality of poverty in his city, and so employs a swallow to prolong its flying south for the winter in order to pick his jewels and gold plating and take it to those in need. Poignant, tragic and beautiful, I read this story when I was a child and it's stayed with me ever since. Lynch's illustrations are the best here, with aerial scenes that are from (literally) bird's eye-view.<br />\\"The Remarkable Rocket\\" is not however, one of the most memorable...in fact its downright boring. At the Prince's wedding a box of rockets are let off, including one arrogant one that is completely wrapped up in its own importance. That's about it, and yet it stretches over 17 pages. No one will blame you if you skip this one, and even Lynch seems a bit confused at how to present this story, creating cartoonish-like fireworks that don't fit in with the rest of the book.<br />Finally, \\"The Young King\\" is also quite long (one sentence has 125 words in it!), but compensates by fascinating imagery and beautiful, mysterious language. No other story shows Wilde's Christianity than here, but it is saved from being to preachy and moralising by the very real sense of the higher powers at work upon the Prince who adores beauty above all things, but is given several dreams (both beautiful and disturbing) that show him how this beauty is acquired. Again Lynch works wonders with his precise water-colours, though be warned there are a few rather dated assumptions of ethnicity, including the words \\"Negroes\\" and \\"Moors\\" in a negative light.<br />With the rest of the mysticism and violence of other stories, and the sparseness of Lynch's illustrations such language further implies that the title \\"Stories for Children\\" is misleading - surely these words could have been changed for that suited audience. This is more of an anthology for adult collectors, but such people may want to look for a more complete version - only those who adore the work of P. J. Lynch may want to purchase this book.

US	39424751	RDJWLOL1AL2NU	0345434110	241741985	Star Wars, Episode I: The Phantom Menace	Books	3	1	1	N	N	&quot;Clouded This Boy's Future Remains...&quot;	Terry Brook's most famous contribution to bookstores is his &quot;Shannara&quot; series, which I personally found a bit too close to the Tolkien formula to find particularly interesting, much preferring his more original &quot;Running With the Demon&quot; saga. But in novelizing George Lucas's screenplay &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, Brooks has found the perfect arena to instigate his clear, graceful style of writing.<br />It seems pointless in relating the plot, since I can't imagine anyone reading this book who isn't a Star Wars fan and hasn't already seen the movie (perhaps several times), but just in case, &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; begins the Star Wars saga against a backdrop of political manouvering. The planet of Naboo has been invaded by the greedy Trade Federation, but Queen Amidala is able to reach the Republic and its Senate under the protection of two Jedi: Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi in order to seek aid for her home planet. On route to the Republic's base in Coruscant however, the company must make a stop on the desert-planet Tatooine, where they meet with Anakin Skywalker, a young slave with enigmatic origins, the makings of a great Jedi, and an uncertain future. This fateful meeting sows the seeds of all that is to pass...<br />As mentioned, Terry Brook's style is perfect in order to present the sometimes-complicated subject matter clearly and concisely. Whilst watching the movie for the first time I was often confused at the fast-paced unfolding of events that occured, but on reading Brook's narrative the screenplay became clearer. Likewise, his depictions of the characters are very true to what unfolded on the screen and we can finally get a look inside their heads and see what truly makes them tick. This is especially true of Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan and Brook's commentary on their opposition concerning their interpretations of the Force: Qui-Gon is more attuned to the &quot;living-Force&quot; that stresses the importance of each individual, whilst Obi-Wan holds to the &quot;unifying-Force&quot;, that tends to look at the bigger picture. It is the two Jedi that benefit the most from Brook's narrative and thus come across as the main protagonists. Unfortunately, Anakin does not fare quite as well, with many similar sections of character insight devoted to boyhood dreaming, and Brooks seemed so determined to keep Amidala's true identity a secret that we never get inside her head at all.<br />Throughout, Brooks takes the opportunity to add little scenes that weren't on the big screen: either intended and deleted scenes, or from the author's own imagination, it doesn't matter, as they serve to flesh out the story a bit more and slow the pace. Thus the story opens with Anakin in the desert and continues adding little scenes of his life before he meets Qui-Gon (otherwise the reader would not have come across him until chapter nine). One particularly evocative scene that bears more weight after watching Episode II involves Anakin helping an injured Tuskan raider. Recalling Anakin's later involvement with this species in the following movie leads me to believe that Brooks may have had knowledge Lucas's entire story, and so it pays to watch out for other bits of foreshadowing that Brooks sprinkles throughout, such as: Anakin's dream of Padme leading an army, Yoda's doubt at Obi-Wan's ability to properly train Anakin, and a secret smile on a politician that hints he may have a secret adjenda going on *cough*Palpatine*cough*.<br />Brook's descriptions of scenery, machinery and characters are beautifully done, and since only example can convince you, take a read of: Qui-Gon - &quot;a tall, powerfully built man with prominent, leonine features. His beard and mustache were close cropped and his hair was worn long and tied back.&quot; Or of the Jedi Council room: &quot;The room was circular and domed, supported by graceful pillars spaced between broad windows open to the city and the light.&quot; See what I mean? It is all very brief, but clearly and simply told. The only weak areas are the action sequences, but whether it's Lucas Jedi matches or Rowling Quidditch games, such things will always be more exciting to watch than to read, and I must confess I skipped over the pages concerning the Pod-Race.<br />Though it's hardly essential reading, Terry Brook's adaptation is an excellent literary version of the movie, that keeps in the spirit of the Star Wars saga, whilst adding little touches of its own. If you were confused by some of the drama on the screen, this will sort you out, and for veterans there's enough originality to keep you interested: the history of the Sith, the background of the main characters and a look into the workings of the Force that suggest it is more complex than simply a Light and Dark Side.hat I mean?

Unfortunatly we do not see their meeting, but instead join the story half-way through the summer, by which time the two are already best friends.<br />As always, the mysterious Green Knowe is filled with ancient and semi-magical artefacts (all of which are actually real relics that belong in the author's home on which she based the books) and Grandmother Oldknow tells the children stories concerning the past inhabitants of the house. Now for the first time, she tells them a story that holds a more sinister edge to it. In the 17th century a young boy had a tutor that was said to dabble in alchemical practices, and have a number of magical books with which he created his spells. An author with astonishing vision for her time, Boston highlights the unfairness of such a man being thought of as noble and intelligent for following such a practice, whilst harmless women were often prosecuted for dabbling in herblore. Grandmother Oldknow tells the children that Doctor Vogel eventually burnt all his equipment with the help of the local minister (whose testimony was found in \\"The River of Green Knowe\\", but only now translated), but it is rumoured that one book of dark spells may have escaped the flames.<br />In typical Green Knowe fashion, in which the past regularly surges up to greet the present, it is not just a coincidence that directly after this storytelling a new neighbour comes to call: Melanie Powers, whose interest in the house and in the legend of Dr Vogel hints at her true intentions. She is after the missing book, and begins a systematic assault on Green Knowe as its first truly evil antagonist, whereas up until now the worst the children have faced is meddling adults. Like the Twelve Plagues of Eygpt, Ms Powers sends nasties crawling into the Green Knowe: maggots, snakes and bird-snatching cats.<br />But of course, Tolly and Ping have their own spells and allies, and with this comes wonderful reappearences from previous characters, including the spirit of the gorilla Hanno and the ghostly past-resident Susan. Even the starlings, who have been pests in previous books, prove their worth. It is stirring stuff to see the children fight passionatly for the home they love and attempt to reach the book before Powers does. I only wish Boston had taken the opportunity to include more characters: what about Ida and Oskar? Toby, Alexander and Linnet? Boggis and Feste the horse?<br />It is the first Green Knowe book to instigate a good against evil theme, and for that reason is sure to be a favourite among most readers since all the other books make more meandering and whimsical reading. In fact, one should be warned that this installment can get a little scary at times, and even gruesome, as in the case of Powers hanging dead birds on a clothesline or the sight of a horned ritual stick, which was described so evocatively that it sent shivers down my spine: \\"they recognized it at once as absolutely evil.\\" I should also warn New-Agers and modern day \\"witches\\" that Ms Powers is a witch in the medieval description of the word - with black magic and links to Satan.<br />A great addition to the \\"Green Knowe\\" books, though often mistaken for the final installment. This is false, as there are six books in the series, and the last title is \\"The Stones of Green Knowe\\", an essential part of the collection. Boston claims that she wrote these books for her own amusement, and that has never been more apparent than in \\"An Enemy at Green Knowe\\" since many questions are left unanswered concerning the background of Mr Powers and the real intentions of Dr Vogel, yet despite that, this book is one of my favourites.<br />And as always, Peter Boston's illustrations are excellent, and I love Brett Helquist's new covers; let's face it, these books were in need of a face-lift.'s face it, these books were in need of a face-lift.	2004-02-18

Toby and Jo are two brothers on holiday with their parents. They've made friends with the lobster man who sells polished shells for extra money. At the beginning of this story he shows them his latest find - a smooth perfectly egg-shaped stone that the two boys instantly feel they have to own.<br />With the stone purchased, they take it away to their secret rock pool and sure enough, the next day whilst seal-watching, they see what looks like a young boy amongst the seals - a young boy with fish tails! From there comes a slow easy narrative about the visits the boys spend with the triton - a sunny day at the rock pools, shell-collecting on a small island and an evocative moonlight swim, before storms on the shore force the family inland - but not without one final call from their triton friend.<br />Like all Boston books the narrative is strange: more interested in being poetic and deep than creating a morale or in character development. However, if you are already familiar with Boston's books, then there's no surprises here. Her language is utterly beautiful in creating the many moods and tones of the ocean, and the moonlight swim in particular reads like verse.<br />The triton's origins are clear: in Boston's home there was (and I presume, still is) a Roman bust of a young boy titled &quot;triton&quot;, and appeared in another of her books &quot;Guardians of the House&quot;. He is clearly the star of the story, and his mischievious smile and playful antics are exactly what one would suspect from a sea-creature. Despite Toby seeming a bit more imaginative than Jo, the boys are basically clones of each other, but with surprisingly sympathetic parents for a fantasy novel (usually in this genre all grown-ups are antagonists). However, she is spot-on with some of the things the boys get up to - watch out especially for the scene when they con money out of their parents and when they sneak home in the middle of the night right under their babysitter's nose - they're hilarious!<br />All in all &quot;The Sea Egg&quot; is a rather strange book, with a dreamy story and a somewhat abrupt end. Boston's beautiful prose prevents it from becoming an Enid Blyton-type 'boys-meet-magical-creature' story, and as usual her son Peter Boston's illustrations (that use sillhouettes and cross-hatching to suggest light, beings and water) are mysterious to behold.he boys get up to - watch out especially for the scene when they con money out of their parents and when they sneak home in the middle of the night right under their babysitter's nose - they're hilarious!<br />All in all &quot;The Sea Egg&quot; is a rather strange book, with a dreamy story and a somewhat abrupt end.

There is no Tolly or Grandmother Oldknow and their discoveries of past inhabitants of the house, but rather two elderly women who rent the house and send away for a niece and two children from \\"the Society for the Promotion of Summer Holidays for Displaced Children.\\"<br />Thus \\"The River at Green Knowe\\" is definitely moving in a different direction from the previous books, and continues with Boston's decision to set most of the scenes upon the river, as Ida, Oskar and Ping explore the flooded areas and the islands around the ancient house, often meeting strangers who are just as Displaced as they are. The adventures that they experience are dreamy and mysterious within the shrouded waters and woodlands, and one is never quite sure whether they are dreams or reality save that all three of them experience them.<br />These exertions are also different from Tolly's adventures in that they are more magical experiences rather than ghostly, and therefore need readers to suspend disbelief a little further. The fact that the children's experiences are all quite separated from each other and episodic also makes them a tad uneven. Some are based more on naturalistic themes, such as an overgrown river-side house, witnessing a pagan-festival in a time-travelling moment and meeting a busman who wandered into the woods and decided to remain there always, whilst others are of the extraordinary type: an island of winged horses, a giant who doesn't know what laughter is but eventually joins the circus, and one of the children shrinking down to mouse-size. Needless to say, Boston's style is suited best to the more natural occurences that just border on the supernatural. To me at least, the others come across as a little *too* odd.<br />However, there is a theme that hasn't been addressed before that pushes through: that of adult disbelief in Green Knowe's magic. Beforehand, all strange events were simply taken in their stride by Tolly and Grandmother Oldknow, whilst here Boston explores the idea of grown-ups not being able to see what the children can. Green Knowe is contrasted against the reality of adult ignorance, whether it be through a frightened, confused message in a bottle, or through Boston's first two comic figures Maud Biggin and Sybilla Bun, who cannot see the truth in front of them even when they've been searching for it.<br />It all goes hand in hand with Oskar's comments on thoughts being real, and Terak telling the children he is so big that no one sees him. Boston weaves these ideas through her narrative with ease, and as always her poetic language is utterly beautiful. I don't think Oskar or Ida were quite as well defined as Tolly or as Ping becomes in later books, which is a shame as they had the potential to be fascinating - and they don't appear in any later books. However, keep a look out for a dark figure examining the the house that *does*.asn't been addressed before that pushes through: that of adult disbelief in Green Knowe's magic. Beforehand, all strange events were simply taken in their stride by Tolly and Grandmother Oldknow, whilst here Boston explores the idea of grown-ups not being able to see what the children can. Green Knowe is contrasted against the reality of adult ignorance, whether it be through a frightened, confused message in a bottle, or through Boston's first two comic figures Maud Biggin and Sybilla Bun, who cannot see the truth in front of them even when they've been searching for it.<br />It all goes hand in hand with Oskar's comments on thoughts being real, and Terak telling the children he is so big that no one sees him. Boston weaves these ideas through her narrative with ease, and as always her poetic language is utterly beautiful. I don't think Oskar or Ida were quite as well defined as Tolly or as Ping becomes in later books, which is a shame as they had the potential to be fascinating - and they don't appear in any later books.

Much of Jane Langton's classic Hall Family Chronicles is based on her obvious love for Concord, Massachusetts and its rich literary heritage and historical importance; in particular Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thereau and Louisa May Alcott, all of whom appear in \\"The Diamond in the Window\\" in one way or another. Langton was seemingly so greatly inspired by them, it may be a good idea if children reading this book are given a short introduction to exactly who these people are beforehand, to save them being rather puzzled as to who the philosopher, the naturalist and the author actually are.<br />Edward and Eleanor Hall live in a strange old house with their aunt Lily and their somewhat crazy uncle Freddy, all of whom are put under threat by the grumpy Mr Preek the bank manager, who promises to evict them should Lily not be able to pay her proper dues in time. Meanwhile, the children discover a secret room with a key-hole window at the very top of the house that seems to be just waiting for two children. As it turns out, the room once belonged to children their ages - Nora and Ned, who disappeared into thin air many years ago. Along with the children was Prince Krishna of India, who had stayed with the family and was very great friends with the children and the fiancee of aunt Lily. After Ned and Nora disappeared however, it was only a matter of days before he too was gone.<br />Beguiled by this strange adventure, Edward and Eleanor decide to investigate further, especially into the part of the story that told of Krishna lavishing expensive gifts upon the children - if they can find the treasure, they can save their home! Following the clues of the poem Krishna etched on the key-hole window for the amusement of Ned and Nora, the two present children find themselves drawn deeper and deeper into the game that the Eastern Prince devised so long ago. With each dream they experience in the attic room they are delighted by magical adventures and lessons to be learnt about the true nature of \\"treasure\\", though there is a hint of danger: nightmarish components creep into the game till they fear that their very lives are in danger - and they seem no closer to finding the elusive Ned and Nora.<br />\\"The Diamond in the Window\\" is a rather difficult book to class - part fantasy, part history and part domestic life, it combines all three in an unusual mix that is mostly made up of the children experiencing a strange dream, and waking up with further insights into their self-growth. A word of caution: some of these adventures can get a bit extreme - the children face drowning, a homocidal jack-in-the-box and at one stage Edward gets badly physically hurt. These events are nothing that most kids can't handle, but the seriousness with which they are treated with was a little unexpected for a children's book.<br />The dream sequences are brought to life very imaginatively, from experiences as mice, to exploring a conch shell, to floating about in giant bubbles and the mounting tension as the children get closer and closer to their goal is well drawn out. The villain of the piece isn't that interesting, as he isn't even identified until *after* he's defeated, but the mystery surrounding Prince Krishna compensates for this.<br />The patriotic nature of Langton's book mean Americans will get the most out of reading it (not that that's a bad thing), though in terms of gender equality, it is beginning to date a little. For instance, when the children find themselves in a hall of mirrors reflecting their possible future selves, Edward sees himself as a scientist, a mathematician, a professor, a lawyer, an explorer and the President. Eleanor however gets the choice of artist, mother, teacher or \\"lady-doctor\\".

Each book is based on a basic premise: a young child with the usual kid problems (home trouble, bullies, crushes, angry teachers, etc) stumble across Mr Elives' Magic Shop, and leave with an unusual purchase that creates more trouble for them, but ultimately teaches them important lessons.<br />In this case, Jeremy Thatcher escapes two bullies, the resentful nature of his art teacher and the unwanted affections of Mary Lou by ducking into the Magic Shop, where Mr Elives gruffly allows him to take home a strange glistening sphere with a sheet of mysterious instructions - it would seem Jeremy is about to hatch a dragon's egg! With the tiny dragonlet Tiamat born, but growing steadily by the day, Jeremy gains more confidence against the problems in his life, as well as more creative flair with the inspiration that Tiamat magically places in his mind's eye.<br />Obviously, a baby dragon in the house is not as easy as it sounds, and even though only Jeremy can see her, Tiamat is still able to manipulate circumstances around her with her fiery breath. But Tiamat must eventually return home to her own world, and along with the mysterious, beautiful Miss Priest and Mr Elives, Jeremy participates in the ritual to send her to the \\"dragon-world\\". Despite the loss however, Jeremy has found a new outlook on life, had old friendships tested and new ones forged, and come to understand a spiteful teacher better.<br />With little dashes of real dragon lore mingled in with his own creative liberties, Coville makes the world natural enough for belief to be suspended, although as an older reader, I would dearly like to know more about the Shop, its owner and its associate Miss Priest. Who are they really? How do they pick the children they give gifts to? How does the Shop move around? If he wished, Coville could make these short but sweet stories into something much more deep and interesting.<br />As I said, the Magic Shop books are great for younger readers, with enough of the every-day troubles to relate to, and enough of the fantasy elements to fire their own imaginations.<br />Its also worth mentioning that if you're a part of a country that recieves the Great Britain copies of these books, there are some wonderful new covers to behold by the artist Tony Diterlizzi, best know for his illustrations in the \\"Spiderwick Chronicles\\", that beautifully capture the children's personalities and their magical companions.le could make these short but sweet stories into something much more deep and interesting.<br />As I said, the Magic Shop books are great for younger readers, with enough of the every-day troubles to relate to, and enough of the fantasy elements to fire their own imaginations. <br />Its also worth mentioning that if you're a part of a country that recieves the Great Britain copies of these books, there are some wonderful new covers to behold by the artist Tony Diterlizzi, best know for his illustrations in the \\"Spiderwick Chronicles\\", that beautifully capture the children's personalities and their magical companions.	2004-02-03

The author who is most famous for the &quot;Green Knowe&quot; series lived during her lifetime in an ancient manor at Hemingford Grey, and devoted much of her life in restoring the house and grounds, which is now open for visitors. In this case, it is the house rather than the gardens that recieves the most attention, and though I have never been to Boston's home myself, the blurb tells me that several of the faces within the book are real items within the manor.<br />Like almost all her books, Boston begins with the usual senario - a young boy (in this case Tom) is drawn to an old house lived in by an elderly woman. When he is sure she has left, he creeps in to explore (the moral implications of this aren't touched on, but the dream-like narrative compensates for this trespassing). Surrounded by disembodied voices and strange masks, Tom embarks on a series of strange adventures with several of the faces dotted around the house: a donkey's head made of straw, a Roman triton's bust, an Eastern goddess idol, and an Indian face. Each face magically transports him to another place and time, whether it be a jungle, an undersea city, or a temple in the desert, all of which are both magical and dangerous, till finally he is overly frightened, and leaves the house.<br />Needless to say, it is a rather bizarre book, that comes across almost as a writing exercise or prose-poetry reading that was accidently published. Whatever the case, it is clearly a pet-project of Boston's, what with the features of her own house being brought to the page. Yet despite this there is something oddly fascinating about it. There is not much of a story, and Tom is hardly a well-developed character, but Boston's beautiful writing style makes this a hypnotic read - but perhaps not for children. Several of the adventures contain rather frightening imagery, including a tiger attacking a man, and a disembodied mackintosh chasing Tom - not to mention the fact that the story does not really have a beginning, middle or end: I predict children would be quite baffled at this.<br />Instead, if you are an adult fan of Boston or a collector, then &quot;The Guardians of the House&quot; might interest you. I believe that it is the book that was closet to Boston's heart given the fact that artefacts from her own home feature in the story, and I don't find it hard to imagine that the entire book was a daydream of hers surrounding her house-hold faces and what they would do to protect her house if a Tom *did* actually intrude. Reading &quot;Guardians&quot; in that way, is a bit like wandering into someone else's dream: it's surreal, it's mysterious, it's oddly spiritual, and it's ultimately ingrossing. If you've ever fancied the idea of visiting Boston's home based on your readings of the &quot;Green Knowe&quot; books, then this is the book that will make up your mind.<br />By the way, Peter Boston (Lucy's son) also illustrates &quot;Guardians&quot;, and I think they're the best I've seen (perhaps because he had the real faces to sketch?)r attacking a man, and a disembodied mackintosh chasing Tom - not to mention the fact that the story does not really have a beginning, middle or end: I predict children would be quite baffled at this.<br />Instead, if you are an adult fan of Boston or a collector, then &quot;The Guardians of the House&quot; might interest you.

US	39424751	R1I0KCVBLQ00T7	0152149112	475888400	The Castle of Yew	Books	2	10	11	N	N	&quot;This Garden is like a Long Book.&quot;	Lucy Boston is best known for her &quot;Green Knowe&quot; books, suited for a reading age of seven and up, but in 1965 she tested the waters of writing for younger readers, and came up with &quot;The Castle of Yew&quot;. Anyone who is familiar with the Green Knowe stories will instantly feel at home here: a young boy (Joseph) is fascinated by an old house and its mysterious garden, and so under orders from the postman to deliver the old lady's letters, he takes the opportunity to look around.<br />But of course, magic is alive in the garden, and on finding a lawn created like a chess board with pansy-and-turf squares and yew cut into the shapes of the chess pieces, Joseph finds himself naturally small enough to fit into the rook hedge-sculpture - the yew castle of the title. Joined by an older boy named Robin, who rides the knight-piece like a horse, the two boys explore their new surroundings as tiny beings, and face the dangers of pecking moorhens, hungry cats and huge dogs, whilst at the same time furnishing their home with bits and pieces they find around the garden.<br />It is a basic premise, and unfortunatly one that has been done to death: everyone one at some point reads of people shrinking and growing and the dangers they face, with Lewis Carroll (&quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;) as the obvious example. Despite Boston's beautiful, mysterious prose that is the trademark of all her works, and her uncanny ability to clearly create landscapes, there is not much in &quot;The Castle of Yew&quot; to recommend it. It is not long enough to create any sort of mystery or story-line to keep older readers interested, but is too experimental and poetic to spark the basic imaginations of younger ones.<br />Lucy Boston is a talented writer, and I *highly* recommend the &quot;Green Knowe&quot; books, but &quot;Castle of Yew&quot; seemed to come across as an idea left over from her more popular books. If you are interested in Boston's writing career or a collector, then by all means read it, but I found it ironic that the old woman described her garden as being &quot;like a long book - you never know what you will find on the other side of the page&quot; - a most unsuited comparison for the garden *and* the book.<br />As a matter of interest, the illustrator is Margery Gill, more famously known for her illustrations in Susan Cooper's Dark is Rising series. Usually Peter Boston, Lucy's son illustrates her books, but Gill does a nice job in his place.all means read it, but I found it ironic that the old woman described her garden as being &quot;like a long book - you never know what you will find on the other side of the page&quot; - a most unsuited comparison for the garden *and* the book.<br />As a matter of interest, the illustrator is Margery Gill, more famously known for her illustrations in Susan Cooper's Dark is Rising series.

In fact, the two series are so similar in their quirky humour and fantasy elements, that I wouldn't be surprised if J. K. Rowling has had a read of these books.<br />Like all the children in this series, Jeremy Thatcher is facing all the usual problems of a young boy: there is an art teacher that hates him, a pair of bullies that torment him, and a girl with a mighty big crush on him. After a particularly bad day of facing these three problems, Jeremy escapes into Mr Elives Magic Shop, where he ends up buying a mysterious sphere of dreamy colours. On taking it home, he reads the instructions that Mr Elives included in the package...instructions for hatching a dragon's egg!<br />Sure enough, after a small ceremony on the front lawn, the egg begins to break - revealing a tiny red dragon inside. Rather frantic, Jeremy begins the process of looking after her: feeding, hiding and generally caring for the dragonlet he names Tiamat. In return, Tiamat helps him out with a few of his own problems, and fills his head with colours and images that set his fingers itching to draw.<br />Finally though, it seems that it's time for Tiamat to return to her own world. With information gathered from the book that the mysterious Miss Priest gives him, Jeremy realises he can no longer keep Tiamat around - especially since she's getting bigger and bigger! So it's one more trip to the Magic Shop, to open a portal between this world and that of the dragons...<br />Reasonably short and sweet, \\"Dragon Hatcher\\" is a book that most young fantasy lovers will enjoy, with enough little tidbits on dragon lore to lend a sense of authenticity to Tiamat's existence. It would be nice to add a bit of meat to Mr Elive's role within the stories, as his motivations are a little unclear: does he purposely draw children into his shop? What is the function of his shop? Who are his usual customers? Does he plan to give out magical items? And what about Miss Priest? What's her story? Although kids won't care, I felt as an older reader the book would have benefited alot by having a little background on the magical aspects explained a bit more. On the whole, a nice blend of the magical with real life senarios, and though a couple of loose ends aren't tied up (what happened to Mr Kravitz? Do Jeremy and Mary Lou remain friends?), a sad but satisfying ending.	2004-01-29

Symbols, circumstances and meanings can be interpreted on any number of deeper levels, making her books ones to be savoured and re-read. If you are a lover of eloquent poetry and subtle imagery, then let \\"Ombria in Shadow\\" be the first of McKillip's range of stories to let you drift away on language that must have been meticulously chosen in order to create a sense of faery and dreaming.<br />The royal prince of Ombria is dead, leaving a child-heir, a grieving mistress and a confused bastard nephew at the mercy of Domina Pearl ('The Black Pearl'), the regent of the city, who is seemingly immortal and has her own dark plans for the ruling of the oldest city in the world. Casting the young mistress Lydea onto the streets and poisoning the young prince Kyel into a state of deep depression is just the beginning. The bastard-son Ducon is drawn almost against his will into the designs of the noble conspirators, when all he wishes to do is attempt to fulfil his passion for drawing doorways, windowsills and other openings - searching for something in his pictures that he doesn't understand.<br />Meanwhile, the mysterious sorceress Faey dwells in the shadows beneath the city, doing whatever magical task the highest bidder pays her for, along with her magical \\"waxling\\" Mag. A creature of magic is what Mag has been led to believe she is, but after accidentally swallowing a heart-spell of Faey's, she begins to feel rather human emotions that bring her tangled into the conspiracy of the crown, with her own part to play...<br />Perhaps the inclusion of all these characters without a clear protagonist is a slight fault of the novel, but in a way I think that is a technique that McKillip sought to take, in the way of puttin Ombria itself in the title role, with all her characters fitting together like a jig-saw puzzle in order to save it. Certainly out of everything, Ombria is her most fascinating creation. Below the sunny streets lies another Ombria, a shadow Ombria: the city's own past. Ghosts and magic dwell there, and the entrances are through abandoned doors and shadows. It is almost as if time itself runs differently in the city - it runs not horizontally, from left to right, but vertically, with the city's past gradually sinking downwards into the underworld (an idea helped along greatly by the imagery presented in the great underground river, lined with empty houses and its black surface lit by lamps). I was utterly intoxicated by such an idea, and the language with which it was used suited it perfectly.<br />As it is, I wasn't entirely satisfied by the conclusion; it was suitably ambiguous, but still didn't answer all my questions, especially concerning the relationship and the real nature of Faey and the Black Pearl.

I'm a little concerned that the previous five books in the \\"Green Knowe\\" series all seem to be back in print whilst \\"The Stones of Green Knowe\\", the sixth and final book (an essential part of the collection) has apparently been neglected. If you are tracking down Lucy Boston's fantastic series of books, then don't stop at \\"A Stranger at Green Knowe\\" - there is one more book to be read, though it is obviously not as well-known as the others.<br />\\"The Stones of Green Knowe\\" completes Boston's series, and aptly takes us right back to the beginning of Green Knowe: to its original construction in 1120 A.D. The very first of the Green Knowe children is Roger, the grandson of a Norman Earl, who is excited beyond words at the building of a two-storied stone house, complete with windows. Roger's days are spent watching the flocks and exploring the construction site, with as much attention given to historical accuracy and detail as one would expect from Rosemary Sutcliffe. Like all the previous young protagonists, he is surrounded both by semi-mysterious characters sympathetic to his situation (such as the Viking Olaf Olafson, who gifts him with a magical knife, and another kindly grandmother reminiscent of the not-yet-born Grandmother Oldknow), and characters that make his life a little bit more difficult - such as a snobbish mother, not the first one to appear in Boston's books, leading me to believe that the author knew one personally.<br />Yet despite being surrounded by all this excitement, Roger becomes captivated by the talk of the workers, who mention among themselves two mysterious stones out on the hills: \\"Surely you've heard of them? Very old, they were. Two of them standing out alone on a grassy hill at twilight, it gave you the jumps to see them.\\" Roger, along with his horse Viking and his dog Watchet, seek them out, and by clearing away some brush, discovers the King and Queen Stones: the source of the magic of Green Knowe.<br />From there the real adventures begin, as Roger discovers what later generations have yet to do: time travel back and forth to discover the other children of Green Knowe, and the fate of his beloved home. In true Lucy Boston style, there is added in little notes of Roger's discomfort at the environmental destruction of the forest, but it never overshadows what we are really interested in: his meetings with Toby, Alexander and Linnet, with Susan and Jacob, and with Tolly, all living in the same house at different times. Marvelling at the differences they all face, the reader is eventually rewarded with a beautiful scene of all the children gathered together under the beech tree...joined by yet another unexpected child, who gives Roger a special keepsake.<br />After six books in the series, I was very sad to see its end, as with all great literature, I had grown quite attacted to Green Knowe and its inhabitants. It was a touch of genius to have the final book take place at 'the beginning' as it were, as we finally can understand where St Christopher came from, how Green Knowe got its name, and how the time travelling was made possible in the first place: through the Stones, whose origins remain an eternal mystery. If there was one fault, it was that Ping, Ida and Oskar were completely absent - in the final book, surely it would have been the right time to bring ALL the children together, but it seems Boston wanted to keep only the children of Roger's bloodline in for simplicity's sake.<br />\\"The Stones of Green Knowe\\" is the perfect ending to a stunning series of somewhat unknown books, leaving us with the major theme of the books: the ongoing battle to protect that which is natural and beautiful. I found it extremely fitting that the book ended with one last enigma concerning the fate of the Stones, and what appears to be the end of the time-travelling, for the last sentence of this last book took my breath away in its sadness and potency.egin, as Roger discovers what later generations have yet to do: time travel back and forth to discover the other children of Green Knowe, and the fate of his beloved home.

Young Adam O' the Cogs lives a happy enough existence on Malmes-Wutton Estate, a young apprentice of the kindly Edwin Dritchley, and skilled in the mechanics of the robotic animals of the island. Along with his friends Henry Wattle and Jack Flye, Adam lives a simple enough life, until a number of unexpected guests arrive at the poor and isolated estate of Lord Richard Wutton.<br />The first is the Queen's spymaster Walsingham and the astrologer Doctor Dee, who have come for reasons concerning the impending war between England and Catholic France/Spain. The second is an Iribian, who literally crash-lands on the estate (leading many to believe he is an angel) and who tastes the smells around him like we would sample food. But there is a secret hovering around this angelic visitor, and when he is summoned to London to see the Queen, Adam and Henry follow, unaware they are going to be forced into discovering just what it is...<br />Robin Jarvis creates a fantastic world of historical figures (such as Robert Dudley and Francis Walsingham) and extraordinary surroundings, including glass-domed cities, collosal night barges, mechanical wonders and alien creatures. To this colourful backdrop is a story of political intrigue, strained friendships, dangerous conspiracies and uncovered secrets. With something happening on every page, both newcomers and fans of Robin Jarvis will not be disappointed with this offering.<br />Perhaps there is a few flaws that should have been dwelt with - the historical background of the &quot;special ambassadors&quot;, as well as the geographical layout of England were rather confusing: without any real exposition explaining both subjects, I was often lost when the characters began talking about either topic. Likewise, the prolouge didn't really seem to mean much in the context of the rest of the stories, but I'm assuming it will come back into play in the rest of the planned future books.<br />Furthermore, the continuing switching points of view from character to character got a bit mind-boggling: in one paragraph you can hear the inner voices of up to three characters. Why not just keep Adam as the narrator for simplicity's sake?<br />But with his usual skill at creating interesting ideas and matching them with his beautiful and realistic illustrations, Robin Jarvis has written yet another ingrossing book.explaining both subjects, I was often lost when the characters began talking about either topic.

Boston's Green Knowe series is a step away from the usual formula. Tolly is absent once more, though luckily Mrs Oldknow has returned in time to receive a letter from young Ida, (from \\"The River at Green Knowe\\") asking her if her friend Ping might stay with her in her mysterious, magically inclined house. Missing Tolly, Mrs Oldknow agrees, and soon Ping, a young Burmese orphan and refugee, is happily exploring Toseland Thicket at Green Knowe.<br />But the story begins long before this, in the Congo, where a young gorilla is separated from his family and captured in order to make the long journey from his tropical home to the concrete realm of the Zoo. In one of the most evocative descriptions of gorilla life and enviroments I've ever read, Boston sets the scene for the story to come with descriptions such as: \\"even at noon the jungle is like a heavily curtained room\\", and \\"thunderstorms worthy of the beginning of the world\\". If you have discovered Boston's incredible use of language in her previous books, then this one won't fail to disappoint.<br />When Ping and Hanno the gorilla first meet at the Zoo, there is an instant connection bordering on the spiritual. It therefore seems almost fate that when Hanno goes missing from the Zoo (escaping via a clumsily locked door) it is at Toseland Thicket that Ping finds him. Drawing on what must have been carefully researched facts about gorillas and their lives (not suprising since the book was written when gorillas were first being seriously studied), Boston creates an utterly realistic bond between boy and gorilla.<br />But an escaped gorilla is big news, and the authorities cannot be drawn away for long, despite Ping's best efforts. With the police and Hanno's Keeper moving in, it is finally up to Hanno to make a choice: captivity or freedom?<br />\\"A Stranger at Green Knowe\\" is often considered the best of the Green Knowe books because of the sensitive and detailed way in which the gorilla's circumstances are brought to life (there's no sappy Disney \\"Mighty Joe Young\\" here!) Her descriptions on his way of life, his powerful disposition and the tragedy of his being are nothing less than sublime. Like she did with the blind Susan and West Indian Jacob of \\"Treasure of Green Knowe\\", Boston shows a wisdom before her time.<br />However, some people may miss Tolly and the magical elements of the mansion, as this book is focused solely on the real life mystery of the gorillas. Rest assured though, in the next book \\"A Stranger at Green Knowe\\", both Tolly and the magic are brought back in full force. If you are into gorilla stories, I can suggest some movies that you may enjoy: Rene Russo's \\"Buddy\\", \\"Back to the Wild\\" concerning a gorilla taught sign language, and of course \\"Gorillas in the Mist\\".umstances are brought to life (there's no sappy Disney \\"Mighty Joe Young\\" here!)

Tolly has returned to Green Knowe and his Grandmother full of excitement at being there once more, but an unhappy surprise lies in wait for him: the portrait of the children Toby, Alexander and Linnet is missing from the wall. It would seem a small loss but for the fact that its absence means that the children's spirits are also not present in the house.<br />Grandmother Oldknow explains the painting's loss due to poor finances, though soon sparks hope in Tolly for its return due to the tale of the missing treasure of Green Knowe (which he vows to find), and stories of another family ancestor: Susan Oldknow. Born to a vain mother, a kind but absent father, a spoilt older brother Sefton, and an overly pious grandmother, Susan knows her blindness is a terrible blow to the family's pride: \\"I can't take her into society, she'll never be married, and I'll have her *always*!\\" her mother laments when the sad truth is revealed.<br />Smothered by a good-hearted but utterly disillusioned Nanny, Susan is not allowed to do a thing on her own, till her Captain father brings back a gift from his travels that shocks the entire family: a West Indian boy named Jacob to keep her company. Their extraordinary friendship can only be describe through L. M. Boston's beautiful prose, as when the two meet:<br />\\"'Who is it Papa?' Susan asked. Jacob answered for himself, in a voice whose smallest half-utterance she was never afterwards to mistake for any other. 'It's me, Missy.'\\"<br />As with Tolly's previous summer in the house, the line between past and present blurs, and he once again interacts with the older inhabitants of the house, though this time in a far more influential manner, going so far as to actively participate in the stories his Grandmother tells him each night. While other time-travelling stories leave me completely cross-eyed, the \\"Green Knowe\\" stories treat it as something utterly natural, and thus so do the readers.<br />As a sequel to \\"Children of Green Knowe\\", this second part (also published as \\"Chimneys of Green Knowe\\") is undoubtably superior to its predecessor. Though I missed Toby, Alexander and Linnet, their part in the first story was as whimsical spirits - Susan and Jacob have a definite story assigned to them, and interact with Tolly in a more important way, stirring events into being on both sides of the centuries.<br />Lucy Boston creates a sophisticated commentary on prejudice that still rings true today in her use of blind Susan and West Indian Jacob. As she comments, blind people were either poor and beggars, or rich and had servants to live for them, and Susan was certainly of the latter group. As such, the poor girl often finds herself strapped to a chair with her doll tied to its arm, disliked by her grandmother who thinks her condition a judgement for her mother's vain lifestyle, and punished for fingering things. Boston's descriptions of blindness in both Susan's life: \\"things stuck out of space like icebergs out of the sea\\", and Tolly's experiments (he discovers feet are more useful than hands in such an instance) are evocatively written, and so imaginatively told that it won't simply be children so have their minds expanded.<br /><br />Second is Jacob, whose place in the story is still whilst England allowed slavery. This book was first published in 1958, and I was both impressed by Boston's distaste for slavery, and refreshed by the lack of extreme political correctness that so often clogs books on the subject written today. Boston presents the Slave Trade as a simple factuality, that could be neither explained nor excused, but simply a reality.<br /><br />Truly, the \\"Green Knowe\\" stories are among the lost masterpieces of children's literature. Do everyone in your family a favour and read them - the house, the characters, the situations, and the sublime use of language that Lucy Boston uses is unforgettable.ond part (also published as \\"Chimneys of Green Knowe\\") is undoubtably superior to its predecessor.

When the seventh daughter of King Hulderbrand and Queen Rodehesia is born, the kingdom of Phantasmorania is in a state of extreme excitement. The birth of the seventh in a line of beautiful, blonde, angelic princesses, all named after precious jewels, is a special occasion. Baby Princess Amethyst is set to receive several virtues from the good fairies of the land, despite her father's misgivings, and the entire kingdom is celebrating.<br />But things do not always go as planned, as one fairy in particular is in a bit of a grumpy mood, and not at all eagar to dish out any more Wit, Charm, Courage, Health, Wisdom or Grace - instead she bestows the infant with Ordinariness, and at once Amethyst's golden curls are mousey, her perfect nose is covered in freckles, and her previously cooing baby-talk changes into a very loud scream. As she grows, the stately name of Amethyst drops to the simple \\"Amy\\", and her days are not filled with embroidery and harp-playing, but exersions into the Forest of Faraway.<br />Yet each of her sisters is eventually married off, and soon her parents despair of doing the same to her. A plot is hatched: to hire a dragon to ravage the land in the hopes that a Prince will come to rescue Amy, trapped in a high tower. Amy is disguisted at such a plan, and takes off for the forest, where she begins her own adventures...<br />M. M. Kaye's \\"The Ordinary Princess\\" is without a doubt a charming book, made all the more so by her simple, realistic, and often whimsical illustrations. The creation of an ordinary princess is a welcome to the world of literature in which beauty is predominant among descriptions of heroes and princesses, and it was one of the first of many similar journeys into \\"ugliness\\" as a virtue (the most well known being \\"Shrek\\"). Amy is a good-natured, intelligent, polite girl, and her love story is natural and realistic (well, as realistic as a love story set in a fairytale kingdom can be).<br />However, though the story will appeal very much to young girls, older readers might find the sheer simplicity of the story a little too easy for them. For them, the true identity of Peregrin the man-of-all-work is almost painfully obvious from the word go, and the somewhat cliched descriptions of palaces (marble, diamonds, chandeliers) may be a little well-used. Furthermore, Amy's \\"adventures\\" are not exactly adventurous - there is no dragon-slaying or evil-fighting, she simply spends time in the forest with her animal friends, before seeking out work in another kingdom and meeting her true love. Though M. M. Kaye made the first step back in 1980 in creating a strong female character without the vice of beauty upon her, there was still a fair way to go before women's quests in literature were not defined solely by finding their true love.<br />Yes, I feel a bit mean critising such a sweet, harmless story, but blame my English lecturers and their lectures on the history of feminity in literature - they've made me analyse everything I read! On the whole, there's not a lot to truly dislike about this classic fairy tale, but for those who want to go a bit deeper into the issues raised in \\"The Ordinary Princess\\", try: \\"Ella Enchanted\\" by Gail Carson Levine (which will appeal more to the older readers I mentioned earlier), \\"The Lioness\\" Quartet by Tamora Pierce, for even older ones, \\"A Frog Prince\\" by Alix Berenzy, a new take on the old fairytale, \\"Which Witch?\\" by Eva Ibbotson, who shares a similar sense of humour as M.

Usually these are reserved for the ones that are experienced in childhood and carried through into adulthood, but every now and then one arrives that touch one on so deep a level that one feels they've always known them. \\"The Children of Green Knowe\\" is one such book.<br /><br />This is the perfect book for anyone that has a love of old homes, and especially for those who have very little chances of exploring them, much less living in them. Since Lucy Boston wrote the Green Knowe series based on her own house and garden that was built nearly nine hundred years ago, the descriptions of the house and grounds are painstakingly created and thus utterly realistic. As her young protagonist explores them, so too does the reader, and her poetic imagery concerning all the marvels that he finds are vivid, mysterious and beautiful all at once.<br /><br />The story itself is slow and dreamlike; it can hardly be called a story, rather it is better described as the record of a young boy and his semi-magical experiences throughout his winter at Green Knowe. Seven year old Toseland is sent to live with his great-grandmother during the school break whilst his parents are in Burma, and despite some initial fears concerning Mrs Oldknow and her strange existence in the flooded waters of the property, Toseland (or \\"Tolly\\" as she calls him) soon finds himself quite at home among the welcoming atmosphere of the house, the variety of friendly animals, and the myraid of interesting relics to be found. Outside, the wintery landscape goes through many changes, from a flooded lake to snow-covered hillocks, all watched over by the statue of St Christopher against the wall.<br /><br />But there are other components at work that Mrs Oldknow and her manservant Boggis seem reluctant to talk about - the spirits of children that lived in the house over three hundred years ago still seem to be dwelling within the house: Alexander, Toby and Linnet. Tolly is eagar to get to know them, especially if it means seeing Toby's old horse Feste, and through several designs of his own, Tolly just might get his wish. The visitations with the \\"ghosts\\" come across as perfectly natural and not at all sinister, through there is just the right amount of mystery about them that keeps the normality of the house just forever verging on the magical.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Lucy Boston's Catholicism is made clear, through her use of St Christopher and the descriptions of finely decorated cathedrals as opposed to the less-elabourate Protestant churches, and so with Catholic favour comes the barest touch of Paganism that (probably unintentionally) lies behind the animal hedge-sculptures that seem to come to life, the ghostly occurances and the personification of inanimate objects. There is even a touch of the sinister in Green Noah, the evil humped tree that lies as a curse upon the family...<br /><br />For anyone who likes dreamy, meandering stories but have no idea where to find them, look no further than \\"The Children of Green Knowe\\". There's enough charm and mystery for any child or adult who long for such a place to live in, and Mrs Oldknow's stories-within-the-story, Tolly's wonderment at his home, and the many strange events that happen make this a hidden gem in children's literature.of children that lived in the house over three hundred years ago still seem to be dwelling within the house: Alexander, Toby and Linnet.

At the end of the last book, Dido left Nantucket with Captain Hughes, who since then has become rather ill. When the carriage they're riding in overtips thanks to a dodgy cabby-driver, Dido goes for help and soon finds herself in the company of more weird and wonderful acquantices - so many in fact, that they add up to more than all of the previous books put together!<br />Finding shelter for Captain Hughes thanks to the Tegleaze Manor House and its inhabitants (the spoilt young heir Tobis, the matriarchal and domineering Lady Tegleaze and the strange, creepy Tante Sannie) Dido soon suspects the makings of another Hanoverian plot to usurp the British throne and wreck King Richard the Fourth's coronation. But many factions are at work within the plot: the illusive Mr Mystery and his bizarre, life-like puppets, the witch Mrs Lubagge whose dislike for Dido could prove dangerous, Tante Sannie and her Joobie nuts, and even her own father - the self-important Mr Twite, last seen in \\"Black Hearts in Battersea\\"!<br />But Dido is not entirely alone; there is the blind, but kindly Tom Firkin, the terrified Cris and his mysterious \\"Aswell\\", Yan and his band of smuggling \\"Gentlemen\\" and of course Lord Sope and his bun-loving elephant Rachel. But into these friends and allies Aiken still places a sense of displacement for young Dido, a feeling of being a cuckoo in a nest that does not belong to her, though at the conclusion of the story one gets the hope that this will not always be so, as a past friend comes in search of her...<br />In many ways \\"The Cuckoo Tree\\" is quite different from the previous books in the series, despite the traditional story of the Hanoverian plot and its increasingly dubious means of putting Prince George on the throne (if you thought the giant gun was extreme, wait till you've seen what they've cooked up here!) But the cast of characters in \\"The Cuckoo Tree\\" is much more vast than usual, to the point where it got difficult to keep track of them all, and certain parts a little darker than usual, with the use of witchcraft and attempted murder. Furthermore, some ideas, such as Aswell, Tante's eventual fate, and Dido's increasing loneliness are more suited to an older audience than the light-heartedness of the former books. But for me anyway, these deeper levels only make the books more fascinating, and I hope the trend continues in further books in the series.as extreme, wait till you've seen what they've cooked up here!)

And the biggest Traction City of them all is London, on the move for larger hunting grounds and more resources.<br />Living in London are two very different young people - Tom, a Third Class Apprentice in the History Guild, and Katherine, an upper class noble daughter of the famed archeologist Thaddeus Valentine, whom both of them adore for his bravery and exciting exploits. Yet after London destroys the small town of Salthook whilst the three of them are touring the Gut (the engineering belly of London), one of the refugees attacks Mr Valentine in a furious rage, and is only just stopped by Tom's intervention. Chasing her up the levels of the Gut, Tom corners her before a chute that leads to the desolate Out-Country, and is horrified beyond comprehension when Mr Valentine pushes the both of them down it. Now stranded in the Out-Country with the young lady named Hester Shaw, with the hideously disfigured face, Tom is pushed into a series of adventures including aviators, pirates, slave-traders and Static towns, during which he begins to realise: things do not exist as he has understood them. And all the while, they are being hunted by a tragic and fatal being known as Shrike...<br />Meanwhile, back in London, Katherine is doing some investigating of her own concerning the disappearence of Tom and the assassin. Once her father leaves on a mission which purpose he conceals even from her, she begins to find pieces of the puzzle concerning an Ancient piece of Old-Tech that is somehow wrapped up in Hester Shaw and her father's unspoken past. Together with a witness to Tom's fall, a lowly worker named Bevis Pod, Katherine learns the truth about her father, and the catastrophic plans the Mayor of London has in store for the device known as the MEDUSA.<br />The real enjoyment of this book comes from Philip Reeve's wonderful creation of an interesting and detailed (but without becoming too encyclopedic) world, set in a post-apocalyptic world where collosal cities trundle desolate plains, filled with relics of the Old World - the world as we know it today. Usually descriptions of machinery or other technicalities bore and confuse me, but Reeve writes with such clarity, that the city of London and its layered Tiers is brought to complete and convincing life. Likewise, the cultures found outside the cities are unique and interesting, and once Tom and Hester start out on their journey, its very likely one will be unable to resist exploring with them.<br />Storywise, the plot is simple, but with just enough twists to keep one interested. All the characters, even villians that at first glance appear one-dimensional have hidden motives to their actions, and the conflict between them and the cultures that they represent is believable, and morally complex. Only the ending disappointed me somewhat - Reeve seemed determined to kill off as many of his characters as possible, leaving me a little immune to the tragedy of death, and the conclusion ends more on a note of despair than hope for the future, given the sheer amount of death and destruction that the survivors leave in their wake.<br />Of all the major protagonists, the females end up being more interesting than the males, though in fact Tom is given the most attention. This is unfortunate, as I found myself disliking Tom for much of the story - he is a character like Lloyd Alexander's Taran in the Chronicles of Prydain, in that he dreams of glory, thinks highly of the wrong people, and holds tight to beliefs that the reader can see are false from the very beginning of the book. Unlike Taran however, it takes a long time for Tom to find self-realisation, and as such the reader feels on-going frustration for his ignorance and on-going commitment to make the wrong choices. However, he *does* eventually grow (albeit in a rather patchy manner), and through him Reeve addresses the important questions of life. Reeve's other hero, Bevin Pod is endearingly shy and uncertain of himself, showing immense bravery when he is aware of the horrors he would face in the Deep Gut should he be caught, and dotingly loyal to Katherine.<br />It is the girls that I found more likeable - Hester Shaw, an imbittered, independant young woman whose hideous face is an ongoing pain for one who loves and appreciates beauty, and lives only to bring death to the one who inflicted this upon her. Katherine at first glance appears as a \\"poor little rich girl\\", but is intelligent, resourceful, and has a clear idea in her mind of the differences between right and wrong.<br />\\"Mortal Engines\\" is ultimately a well-crafted book, along the lines of Phillip Pullman's \\"Northern Lights\\" and Garth Nix's \\"Sabriel/Lirael/Abhorsen\\" trilogy. If you liked the atmosphere and flavour of those two books, I strongly suggest \\"Mortal Engines\\" a go, and keep your eyes open for the sequel.ing of the book.

But Devon is not as afraid of his future as others in his shoes would be: he knows he is gifted with a special power, a power that protected him from the very real demons and monsters that he had dwelling in his cupboard and under his bed as a child. Now, he seeks to find who he is, and why such things happen to him, for on his death bed, his father claimed he was not his biological father. Guided by the calm and powerful Voice in his head, that grants to him his own brand of magic, Devon is eagar to begin his investigation.<br />At Ravenscliff are a host of intriguing characters waiting for him - the glamourous Mrs Crandall, his new guardian, who undoubtably knows more than she's saying, and her daughter Cecily, in whom Devon hopes to find a friend. As well as this is the unfriendly manservant Simon and Mrs Crandell's nephew Alexander - a violent and disfunctional boy who spends all his time watching a replusive clown on the television and seems to both hate and like Devon. And on top of all this is Old Mrs Crandell, the somewhat senile old woman who's spent several years in her bedroom, seeing no one but her daughter.<br />And outside the grim seaside mansion is the elusive figure of Rolfe Montaigne, who has a connection to the house's secrets and the death of two young people several years before. Mystery piles up upon mystery as Devon learns of the many ghosts of the house - the weeping Emily Muir, the sad and tragic Horatio Muir, and the wicked Jackson Muir, whom Devon begins to suspect has a hold over the eight year old Alexander, who at times certainly seems like a boy possessed. And then some of the truth concerning his own destiny arises - he is part of the Order of the Nightwing, a powerful sect of sorcerers, a group of people chosen to be guardians over Hellholes: gateways from our world into hell. It is this newfound heritage that Devon will have to learn to master if he's to triumph over the hold Jackson Muir now has over the house...<br />Though many other reviewers have pointed out the similarities between \\"Nightwing\\" and \\"Harry Potter\\" (ie, a young boy with a great destiny, deceased parents, remarkable powers, and so on) I found it to be more along the lines of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", especially in the use of the Hellholes, which basically translate into \\"Buffy\\"'s Hellmouth. However, readers who like either one of these series will probably like \\"Nightwing\\", if they are prepared for a darker, more Gothic look into the world of magic and heroics. There were a couple of things that I didn't quite like - Devon felt more like a seventeen year old than a fourteen year old, and often supporting characters didn't feel quite consistent in their motivations and personalities.

I felt like yelling: \\"I get it! It's mysterious! Move on, already!\\"<br />However, it sustained my interest well enough to be enthusiastic about further exploration into Devon's past and the uncovering of the several secrets left unresolved (such as his parentage, the gravestones, the pentagram on Marcus's forehead, Emily Muir's role, and the history of the Nightwings), and Geoffrey Huntington has a master stroke at representing youth and relationships realistically. Despite the somewhat cliched setting of a dark-and-spooky-manor-with-thunderstorms-outside, Huntington manages to pull it off through his elegant writing, making it seem like a real place, fill of its own history.

It is this newfound heritage that Devon will have to learn to master if he's to triumph over the hold Jackson Muir now has over the house...<br />Though many other reviewers have pointed out the similarities between \\"Nightwing\\" and \\"Harry Potter\\" (ie, a young boy with a great destiny, deceased parents, remarkable powers, and so on) I found it to be more along the lines of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", especially in the use of the Hellholes, which basically translate into \\"Buffy\\"'s Hellmouth. However, readers who like either one of these series will probably like \\"Nightwing\\", if they are prepared for a darker, more Gothic look into the world of magic and heroics. There were a couple of things that I didn't quite like - Devon felt more like a seventeen year old than a fourteen year old, and often supporting characters didn't feel quite consistent in their motivations and personalities.

Whilst the two boys were forced to go on without her (eventually preventing an assasination attempt on the Duke of Battersea), Dido's fate remained a mystery, that Joan Aiken now resolves for expectant readers in the third book in her \\"Wolves Saga\\".<br />After a ten month long sleep, Dido awakes on board a whaler in the middle of the Artic sea, on a boat completely covered in icicles and frost. There she meets young Nate, a ship's hand, who informs her of her surroundings, of how far she is from home. Also on board is the fox-like and slimy Mr Slighcarp and the moony Captain Casket, who is determined to chase and catch the magnificent pink whale. He informs Dido that his young daughter Dutiful Penitence Casket is also on board, but who has locked herself away in a cupboard in mortal terror of the sea. He requests that Dido attempt to coax her out, and then accompany her to her Aunt Tribulation on the island of Nantucket before she tries to head back to England. Dido, taking it into her responsiblity to teach Penitence not to be so timid, agrees despite her homesickness.<br />But there are other mysteries about, such as the fierce stowaway that Dido finds hiding in the hold, and the suspicious actions of Mr Slighcarp that aren't solved by the time Penitence and Dido reach the domineering and threatening Aunt Tribulation. The two girls eventually realise there's a Hanoverian plot in the making that involves a giant gun being fired from Nantucket to London, which will not only succeed in destroying the palace, but with blowing Nantucket backwards into New York harbour! With pink whales, German inventors, hidden woods and a familiar villainess from \\"The Wolves of Willoughby Chase\\", Joan Aiken once more dishes up excitement and intrigue set in her continually-growing parallel world, where history mingles with fiction, and characters engage in some rather incredible situations!<br />To a point, \\"Nightbirds in Nantucket\\" was not quite up to the standards of \\"The Wolves of Willoughby Chase\\" and \\"Black Hearts in Battersea\\", as the duo of the strong-willed Dido and the meek little Penitence reminded me a little too much of Bonnie and Sylvia of \\"Wolves\\", (especially in \\"Aunt Tribulation\\"'s treatment of them), and the Hanoverian plot of conquering King James III was basically the same threat that was faced in \\"Black Hearts\\". However, Joan Aiken's imagination is amazing, whether she be creating the icy whaling ship sailing through the Artic Sea, or the warm sunny moorlands of Nantucket with its white-washed cottages. Her melodramatic plot twists and devices are always humourous and adventuresome (despite their unlikeliness), and the story ends on a note of further adventure for the irrepressable Dido Twite.history mingles with fiction, and characters engage in some rather incredible situations!<br />To a point, \\"Nightbirds in Nantucket\\" was not quite up to the standards of \\"The Wolves of Willoughby Chase\\" and \\"Black Hearts in Battersea\\", as the duo of the strong-willed Dido and the meek little Penitence reminded me a little too much of Bonnie and Sylvia of \\"Wolves\\", (especially in \\"Aunt Tribulation\\"'s treatment of them), and the Hanoverian plot of conquering King James III was basically the same threat that was faced in \\"Black Hearts\\".

US	39424751	R10ZKINLIYREYO	0823405524	977254322	The Water of Life: A Tale from the Brothers Grimm	Books	5	12	13	N	N	Do Not Hesitate: Buy this Book	Without hesitation I can assure you that \\"The Water of Life\\" is one of the most beautiful and intricate fairytales and picture books I have ever come across in my life. If you are a folk-lore scholar, a lover of beautiful illustrations, or a parent who believes that children are capable of absorbing the deeper side of fairytales rather than brainlessly watching the sugary-sweet rubbish that the T.V. spoonfeeds them today, then here is the picture book for you. Retold by Barbara Rogasky and illustrated by the fantastic Trina Schart Hyman, this story is a perfect blending of art and literature, and will stay with you for a very long time.<br />Don't believe me? Well, when I was no more than five years old my father got this book out of the library, but nine years later, all I could remember was a certain illustration that depicted the prince escaping from the enchanted courtyard. It was such a narrow escape as the gates closed on him, that his heel was torn off. This picture and the narrative stayed with me all those years, till I picked up another Trina Schart Hyman book, whose style of illustrations seemed vaugely familiar... After some typing on the public library's search engine \\"The Water of Life\\" was refound, and I stood in the library parking lot staring in amazement at the illustration that had stayed in my head for over nine years.<br />Well enough reminising, I'll get to the plot of the story. It is based on the Brother Grimm story, but unlike other retellings of their tales which \\"shear\\" certain components of their narratives, Barbara Rogasky keeps in all the details and subquests that make the story so intricate. If you've ever read Brothers Grimm you'll know that the pretty little stories you usually see nowadays are very unlike their original counterparts. Often the Grimm Brothers would go off into tangents in their storytellings, adding unexplained or irrelevent people and events, which made them slightly confusing, but all the more colourful and fascinating. \\"The Water of Life\\" tells the story of three brothers whose father was very ill. After the two eldest brothers go, are rude to a small dwarf traveller and therefore trapped in a ravine between two mountains, the youngest son rides out to find the Water of Life and cure his father. He is not so coarse to the dwarf and so gathers some useful advice: that the Water is held in the fountain of a courtyard in an enchanted castle, guarded by iron gates and fierce lions. The Prince enters this place and there meets a beautiful Princess. You guessed it, it's love at first sight, and the Prince gathers the Water for his father, promising that he'll return to wed the Princess in a year's time. But his treacherous brothers have other plans - to have their brother destroyed and claim the Princess for themselves.<br />It has all the components of a traditional fairytale: an ill king, three feuding brothers, a castle under a spell, a dwarfin companion and a beautiful princess, but here appear like brand new under Barbara Rogersky's working of the mysterious narrative. There are passages of intrigue and detail galore: the table of enchanted princes, the youngest son's travels with the magic bread and sword, the huntsman sent to kill him, and the wise Princess's own plan to secure her true love. Yet despite the darker tones of the tale, the morale shines through: that of honesty, love and truth always coming through in the end.<br />And then of course, there's Trina Schart Hyman's illustrations. They evoke a beautiful and deep medieval/fairytale world, and perfectly echo the story, as well as creating an extra depth of their own. Long after the dwarf disappears from the narrative, he features in the illustrations, peeking from behind trees and watching the action from high bluffs. Likewise, the lions that guard the gates of the castle appear in the narrative only as \\"watch-dogs\\", but continue to appear at the Princess's side like overgrown house cats. There are stories withinstories, as the tapestries in the king's bed chamber seem to tell an unknown but fascinating woodland tale, and there is no picture more intriging than the table of enchanted princes: one with butterfly wings, one with stag's horns, one with a unicorn horn, another with a bird's head... Likewise, the sight of the two elder brothers wedged between two mountains on horseback is comic, claustrophobic, inventive and completely realistic. Finally, everyone may groan at the \\"love at first sight\\" passage, but Hyman's incredible details create love and adoration between two figures that *make* you believe in it. Her details and use of colour are perfection, and out of all her works, \\"The Water of Life\\" is one of the best.<br />Children are some of the most underestimated creatures in the world, and they deserve to have this wonderful story read to them. Turn off the T.V. and open \\"The Water of Life\\". Hopefully Amazon will place a picture of the product on this webpage so that everyone can see for themselves and not just take my word for it just how beautiful this book is.stories, as the tapestries in the king's bed chamber seem to tell an unknown but fascinating woodland tale, and there is no picture more intriging than the table of enchanted princes: one with butterfly wings, one with stag's horns, one with a unicorn horn, another with a bird's head...

It is this world that the Grace children are gradually getting to know, and already they have a couple of brownie/boggart and hobgoblin friends and an injured griffin in the barn. But it just so happens that after centuries of abuse and destruction, the faeries aren't so keen on humans learning about their world once more, and so are out to stop them by any means possible. Mallory and Simon are rather keen on ridding themselves of the Guidebook and thereby getting themselves out of trouble, but Jared, who feels the study of faeries is the only thing he's been really good at refuses, and instead suggest visiting great-aunt Lucinda, the daughter of Arthur Spiderwick, who might have some answers to their questions.<br />From the visit at the old person's home to the discovery of an old map in Arthur's libary, the three children decide to set out and discover what actually happened to Arthur. This leads them to the riddle-speaking Phooka (one of the book's best characters yet!) and the court of the noble, beautiful, but extremely suspicious elves, who are the guardians of the realm of faery, and not at all pleased that humans have breached their domain...<br />I am loving the Spiderwick Chronicles, and personally can't wait until the next installment \\"The Ironwood Tree\\" is published, as it promises even more faeries, including dwarfs! As the poem at the back of \\"Lucinda's Secret\\" says: \\"And beneath the old quarry, just outside of town, lives a king with a kingdom, but who wears the crown?\\" It is almost cruel that publishers make us wait so long.<br />To a point, \\"Lucinda's Secret\\" was not quite up to the success of the two previous books, as the story was quite clearly split into two: the visit to the nursing home, and the trek into the faery realms. Perhaps if they had found the map earlier, and shown it to Lucinda, the book would have felt more fluid. As such, I'm getting a tad concerned at the outcome of this series - its been established that there's only five books in the series, but so far more and more characters and situations are being introduced, with nothing really getting resolved. On top of the theme of the children inflicting on the secret world of the faeries (a theme I thought was more than enough to carry the series along) there were hints here that a good and evil plot strand is arriving soon, with mention of one Mulgarath the ogre gathering malevolent forces to him. Of course, its rather useless worrying about it yet, but I'd hate to be disappointed in this great series, and the sheer shortness of the books (I read \\"Lucinda's Secret in half an hour) means that there's a lot of ground to cover in the remaining two books, and I'd hate to see Thimbletack, Hogsqueal, Byron or the Phooka shortchanged in wrapping up the story.<br />Likewise, the promised \\"Lucinda's Secret\\" wasn't so much of a startling revelation than simply a little background to the Spiderwick family and reassurting what the children already know - not much of a secret! However, the faery lore that Holly Black places within the context of the story is truly wonderful - any long time scholars of faeries will delight in seeing the dangers of faery food, the technique of wearing one's clothes worn inside out, the faery use of stray sods and the power imbued in a name put to good use. And Tony DiTerlizzi's illustrations are an absolute delight. The beautifully clear and intricate pictures perfectly capture what the textdescribes, and creates what I consider the *real* nature of faery - not a silly, pretty little world, but quirky, intricate, and a little dangerous. Any fans of Brian Froud will adore Tony DiTerlizzi's drawings, and I myself almost wept with delight at his depiction of the unicorn - no sweet little pony, but small and stunted, with lion's paws and tail and a goat's beard: exactly how the original unicorns were depicted.<br />Finally, the presentation of the book is stunning, especially in regard to the way the author creates it as a 'real story', with the children of the story actually writing to the authors with their story (and their letter is included!) The Spiderwick Chronicles are perfect for bringing lore of faery to a new generation, and I can't wait for the next book!xt describes, and creates what I consider the *real* nature of faery - not a silly, pretty little world, but quirky, intricate, and a little dangerous.

US	39424751	RD94FFAQLR8LB	0395971284	293418248	Black Hearts in Battersea	Books	4	28	28	N	N	The Next Installment in a Fantastic Adventure	\\"Black Hearts in Battersea\\" is the second book in Joan Aiken's beloved \\"Wolves\\" saga, beginning with \\"The Wolves of Willoughby Chase\\" and continuing in \\"Nightbirds in Nantucket\\". Each book can be read separately and out of order (ie, each is a separate story, not one big story broken into several parts), linked by re-appearing characters, plot lines and locations. Each is set in a cleverly devised \\"parallel universe\\" where historical figures and events are changed from what we would recognise in our own history books. In this case, the action takes place in London, where Britain is ruled by good King James III and plauged by maurauding wolves immigrating from Russia, with other little snippets of an alternative history slipped in to give the book a whimsical, but authentic air. Anyone who has read Diana Wynne Jones's \\"Chrestomanci\\" books, or Phillip Pullman's \\"Northern Lights\\" will have no trouble adapting to this new environment, but those who haven't might be in for a pleasent surprise when they discover some of the little gems Aiken throws in: next to the familiar sights of Hyde Park and St Paul's Cathedral are places such as Battersea Castle on the Thames, made of pinkish stone, and made 'to look like a great half-open rose.' With such a fascinating world to explore, it hardly seems to matter whether there's a story or not.<br />But of course there is, and it perfectly combines with the backdrop Aiken sets for it. Young Simon the half-wild goose-boy, last seen being offered a painting career by Dr Field in \\"The Wolves of Willoughby Chase\\" arrives in London to begin his education at the Art Academy in Chelsea. But things are set to go wrong from the very beginning. On reaching Dr Field's described boarding house, there is no sign of him, and the family Twite insists that they've never heard of him. Befriending their youngest daughter, the rude, filthy, brattish Dido Twite, Simon gradually begins to make his way around in London and at the Art Academy - discovering some very suspicious things concerning the Twites in the meanwhile.<br />He meets up with his old friend from the Poor Farm where he grew up: the lovely Sophie, who is now the handmaiden of the Duchess of Battersea, and with the young Duke-to-be Justin, a somewhat miserable and pathetic boy. In his ever-growing adventures, including visits with the eccentric Duke of Battersea, strange occurances at the Twites, and a highly enjoyable visit to the Fair, Simon comes to uncover a terrible Hanoverian plot to overthrow the king, and the secret to his own mysterious past. With plenty of wolves, fireworks, shipwrecks, kidnappings, suberfuges, maroonings, hot air balloons, explosions, false identities, lucky escapes and poisoned mince pies, \\"Black Hearts in Battersea\\" is a great read, and even better if it's read aloud, either to your own kids or a classroom (the lower classes's Cockney accents in particular are wonderfully created in Aiken's language).<br />Of course, it is unashamedly filled with quirks, coincidences and long stretches of credibilty that will have anyone over the age of eight that enjoy nice, sensible stories raising an eyebrow in skepticism. To read the book critically would destroy any enjoyment one might have of it, as it is most certainly not to be taken too seriously. How could you when you have lines like: \\"My own dear husband's dead brother's long-lost child!\\" Just sit back and enjoy the story, complete with its exaggerations and unlikelihoods, as it harks back to another era where such occurances were taken dead-seriously.<br />The \\"Wolves Saga\\" is a little known, but fantastic series, and I'm sure the previously-mentioned authors (Diana Wynne Jones and Phillip Pullman) owe a lot to Aiken's methods of alternative-history, as she is the first \\"modern\\" writer to the best of my knowledge to instigate such a device. Her characters are great fun (though Bonnie and Sylvia of \\"Wolves of Willoughby Chase\\" were sadly missed) and her stories filled with non-stop excitement and discovery.non-stop excitement and discovery.	2003-11-01

Usbourne no doubt caught onto this popularity, and released the Usbourne Spinechillers, a series of six that delved into the world of ghosts and past mysteries. Among them was \\"Ghost Train to Nowhere\\", one of my favourites.<br />Alf and Chrissy are spending a holiday with their uncle Jack and his cat Salmon in Seabry, an old railway town. Jack himself lives in what used to be the old station, with its old relics still in place: the ticket office, the tiny kitchen, and the shelves of uncollected luggage. But despite the cheerfulness of the place, the twins feel oddly disjointed there, and come to the conclusion that it has something to do with the old railway engine that was closed down many years ago. After strange hooting noises that they take to be an owl, and smoke appearing above the treeline in the woods, they go exploring and run into hte elderly Harold Masters, who tells them the eerie tale of the \\"Gypsy Bell\\" - the train that plummeted over the washed out bridge during a terrible storm, taking with it Harold's twin brother.<br />But apparently that's not the end of the story, as locals have claimed to experience the same phenomena that the twins have - the hooting of whistles and the chugging of steam, even the ghost train itself hurtling down the old track! It seems that somehow the twins are linked to the train, and are the only ones who can possibly hope to right the past wrong, and the journey takes them to the old train tunnel deep in the woods, the abandoned mine, and into their own minds as they come to grips with their own powers.<br />\\"Ghost Train\\" was lucky enough to have excellent illustrations to match the mood of the story, whether it be the warmth of the station-house, the sunny woods with a hint of otherworldliness to them, or the dark mysteriousness of the mines they explore. Human expressions are always very clear, and like in all Usbourne books in this series, little clues and red herrings are scattered throughout the illustrations - if you look hard enough, you can keep one step ahead!<br />Phil Roxbee Cox also created two other books in the Spinechillers series: \\"The Haunting of Dungeon Creek\\" and \\"Nightmare at Mystery Mansion\\", and incorporates some great ideas into \\"Ghost Train\\", such as a crack that slowly and mysteriously winds its way up a window pane, a silver train whistle that goes from shining new to rusted in minutes, and a huge black cat with glowing yellow eyes. The spookiness of the tale is perfectly for young readers, and I also highly recommend the other books in the the Spinechiller series \\"The Midnight Ghosts\\", \\"House of Shadows\\", and \\"Stage Fright\\".s of the mines they explore.

Having recently moved from New York to California to live with her mum's new husband, Suze has had to learn to cope with a new Catholic school and putting up with three new stepbrothers as well as the supernatural antics of the ghosts she has to control.<br />The only people who know her secrets are the kindly Principal Father Dominic and her best friend Gina from New York, who is present throughout this book, and of course Jesse, the incredibly gorgeous ghost that inhabits her room, that Suze has a mighty big crush on. For the moment however, she's happy to hang out with Gina on the beach and enjoy her company whilst it lasts. But that all changes when she spots the four spirits of teenagers that were killed in a car accident on the night of their school prom, who seem eagar to dish out revenge on who they belief was responsible for their deaths: Michal Meducci. This somewhat geeky (but as it turns out, very cute) young man seems to be very accident prone, whether it's giant puppets falling on him at the mall or jellyfish strangling him in the ocean. But Suze knows the truth: the ghosts are out to avenge their deaths, and its up to her to stop them.<br />The core of all of these books is the character of Suze, whom you can't help but like. With her in-your-face attitude concerning the often-violent spirits she comes across, and in the snappy first-person text that Carroll uses to narrate her own stories, she keeps the story bounding along nicely.  And in this case, her voice is needed in order to smooth out an otherwise shaky storyline. There are plot holes galore if you look hard enough (if the car was rammed over the cliff surely the police would have noticed a damaged back-fender) and some rather odd statements that seem to have no place within the context of this kind of story, such as Suze commenting on the traditional covering of Catholic images with black cloth before Easter: \\"Religion. That is some wacky stuff I tell you,\\" and on a school assignment concerning the arms race: \\"We *should* care. Because as the charts Kelly's group was holding up revealed, there were some countries who had way more bombs and stuff than we did.\\" Maybe I'm over-reacting, but a teenage thriller-ghost story doesn't really seem the appropriate place to flaunt one's religious and political ideas, especially when both of them are somewhat offensive.<br />Likewise, the story is hopelessly predictable - as in the previous books a murder takes place that Suze must investigate, which leads her into the clutches of the murderer, who is obvious from the word go due to his/her good looks and insane personality. Ah well, it kept me entertained for three hours, and Suze is definitely quite a character. Her role as Mediator (sort of a blend between Ghostbuster and Vampire Slayer) needs some more meat to it - such as how many are there? Is there an organisation of them? Who/what chooses them? - and then this series could really take off.<br />And could someone please explain why it's called \\"Reunion\\"?

All of them are separated by thousands of years, yet all of them are descendants of each other. They are each called toward the great stone circle in their separate times and greeted by the wizard Urkar who presents them with a task only they can preform: to prevent the chaotic storm of destruction from destroying the world, they must find and return to him three magical staffs that can stabilise the worlds. These staffs represent the three elements of life: water, with a fish head on its knob, earth, with a horse head, and air, with a bird head (what about fire?) With this basic quest outlined, what follows is a fairly predictable storyline - the three children visit each time (past, present and future), find the staff, get into some trouble, and return to the stone circle. The final coming together of the three staffs is hardly a climax, as Urkar's destruction of the storm is told in one single paragraph, and the story is wrapped up hurridly with the children returning to their own times without even so much as a goodbye.<br />The opposite is true of the beginning of the story, as I felt Jamie's longing to see a ghost and thus photographing parts of the old homestead was rather needless in the context of the story, and slowed it down considerably. It is only when the three actually get into the time travelling that things get interesting: Pamela F. Service creates an historically correct (or so I assume) Viking village, a typical Scottish present-day countryside, and an interesting account of future times, where many species collectively live on a somewhat wasted earth. In each of these times the children act realistically toward circumstances, and each other, and their growing awareness of magic, whether its the magic-seeking Arni, skeptical and arrogant Tyaak or Jamie, who lies somewhere between the two.<br />However, I have one last complaint, and that's the role of the bad guys in the story - in each world the kids are meet by antagonists that seem to be aware of what the staffs mean and why they're important, but who these people are, who they're working for and what their intentions were, are kept a mystery. This frustrating lack of answers make them seem two-dimensional and weak, without much potential of being a threat at all.<br />It is a rather slack story based on a good idea, which unfortunately did not quite deliver. Though many components are well imagined and written, and the blend of fantasy/sci-fi and time-slip adventuring was intriguing, the basic plot was too formulaic, the bad guys to simplistic, and the ending too short changed to really make an effort to track this book down. Some parts reminded me a bit of \\"The Dark is Rising\\" by Susan Cooper, so if you enjoy her work, you might want to give this a try, as well as other books by Pamela F.

While those with no knowledge of what comes later in this gifted author's realm of witches, wizards and magic will find this book a pleasant read, those who are already initiated and know what the word \\"Chrestomanci\\" means and how a Castle manages to move about a countryside might be a tad disappointed.<br />Short on pocket money, Frank and Jess decide to open a business known as Own Back, in which they seek revenge on past wrongs for their clients. Secretly they hope to find a way to punish the neighbourhood bully Buster Knell, and so it is a grim task when they find he is their first client. His demand? That they remove a tooth from Vernon Wilkins, the large boy that did the same to him. But this job goes horribly wrong when a simple tooth creates more unwelcome employment for them: two strange little girls who want their house back, Buster Knell's entire gang, and even the strange Biddy Iremonger, who is certainly a witch!<br />Components of Wynne Jones's style is still intact - her quirky way of speaking (newcomers might be confused at the quite literal 'colouful language' that Buster uses) and her intricate melding of several plots and people. But I feel that had she written it today, there would have been deeper reasoning behind Biddy's revenge tactics, more Own Back business for Frank and Jess, an explanation behind the \\"good eyes\\" that Jess is given, and a more sophisicated plot for finally getting rid of the evil witch. However, \\"Witch's Business\\" is humourous, interesting, and serious enough for Wynne Jones fans to enjoy and compare with her later books (I saw touches of \\"Time of the Ghost\\" and \\"Black Maria\\" in the plot) and just as good for new readers to find a new favourite author. They're the lucky ones, gifted with the knowledge that from here, Wynne Jones's work just gets better!	2003-10-13

In this altered history a large number of wolves migrate from the bitter cold of Europe and Russia into Britain via the Channel Tunnel, and terrorise the inhabitants in their continuing hunting.<br />The story is set at Willoughby Chase, the grand home of Lord Willoughby and Lady Green and their daughter Bonnie. Due to Lady Green's wasting illness, Bonnie's parents are taking a holiday in warmer climates and leaving her in the care of the Lord's newly-arrived distant cousin Letitia Slighcarp. Also due to arrive is Bonnie's orphan cousin Sylvia who lived in London with Lord Willoughby's poorer sister Aunt Jane, coming to keep her cousin company in her parent's absence. Sylvia is nervous about the train ride into the vast and wolf-ridden countryside, but the cousins become instant friends on her arrival, with an entire life of playing, skating and adventures together.<br />Yet the blissful life is not to last. In her parent's absence, Mrs Slighcarp takes over the household, dismissing the household servents, wearing Lady Green's gowns, and tampering with Lord Willoughby's legal papers with the help of Mr Grimshaw, the man who was supposedly knocked unconscious on Sylvia's train and taken into the care of Willoughby Chase. Despite the best efforts of James the clever footman, Pattern the girl's beloved maid and Simon, the goose-boy living half wild in the woods, the girl's plans to fetch back their parents goes astray, and Mrs Slighcarp sends them to a dismal orphanage after the news that Bonnie's parents have died.<br />Bonnie and Sylvia quickly weaken under the strain of the difficult living conditions, and Bonnie realises they must find a way to escape due to Sylvia's worsening health. Hope arrives however in the form of Simon the goose-boy, and together they plot a way to escape and reclaim Bonnie's inheritance...<br />I can't imagine a single child that wouldn't find this story appealing. With enough wolves, riches, villains, plotting and child independance to keep them satisfied for a long time, this book is sure to become a favourite, as are the others in the series. Bonnie and Sylvia are wonderful young protagonists, with Bonnie as the confident, ever-optimistic young tomboy, and Sylvia as the more timid, but never annoying, young lady. If you're concerned that boys may not be interested in female protagonists, Simon the young goose-boy should please them, as there's always a fascination for independent children living wild in the forests. Mrs Slighcarp, Mr Grimsby and Mrs Brisket (the *real* wolves of Willoughby Chase) are nasty villains, and therefore good ones, which everyone will love to see get their just desserts at the conclusion.<br />The scenery is beautifully created through Aiken's language, whether it be Sylvia's night time train ride, the opulence of the Willoughby house, or the children's summery travels in the countryside, and the pacing never slows or dwindles on any needless details. One scene in particular, when the girls are being hunted down by wolves on the estate's grounds is particularly gripping.<br />However, some older readers may be skeptical at the actual story itself. It seems to hold every cliche that a Victorian Children's Romance could have: a riches-to-rags-to-riches story, a villainous governess, a forged will, a cruel orphanage, a false death and a great escape, where every possible mishap is conclused with a happy ending - even if it's outrageously implausible (such as Bonnie's parents miraculous escape). Yet despite all this, somehow Aiken seems to make it all seem real and natural through her strong and descriptive writing.

Everyone knows the story of the Frog Prince, and the idea of \\"kissing a frog to make a prince\\" is a well-loved verse around the world. But did you ever think that the spoilt Princess, who first broke her promise to the frog who rescued her ball and then threw him across the room in disgust before he changed into a prince was a little undeserving of her happily ever after? (Some versions of the story have the princess kissing the frog to change him back, but the throwing against the wall is the original and correct tale).<br />Alix Berenzy thought so, and resolved to retell and reillustrate the traditional tale from the frog's point of view. Sure enough, it starts on familiar territory: the Princess drops her golden ball into the pond and the frog retrieves it for her, on the condition that the Princess let him go with her into her palace and remain her companion. The ball is fetched, but the Princess regrets her decision to have the frog as a house guest, and only goes through with her promise on the instruction of her father.<br />But here is where the tale changes - hearing a riddle from the singing moon, the frog decides to go on a quest to find a *true* princess - one that will love him for his inner beauty. The king obliges, shamed by his daughter's ingratitude, and grants him royal clothes and a white pony. Following the sun by day and the moon by night, the frog begins his quest, traversing dangerous trolls, wicked witches, tangled woods and misty oceans to reach the End of the World and the Princess that awaits. Alix Berenzy creates a great twist in the tale by describing the beauty of the Princess in the castle, but making the reader turn the page to see her appearence on the following page - and that appearence is not what you'd expect!<br />The story is a lovely retelling of the traditional tale, undated somewhat for today's standards of teaching kids to look beyond a person's appearence to the soul within. This sentiment is the theme of the entire book, but with side plots of escapes and quests, Alix Berenzy thankfully does not jam it down our throats, and it is shared without overly dramatising it. The illustrations are of course stunning. As a children's illustrator Alix Berenzy is right up there with the masters: K. Y. Craft, Ruth Sanderson and Alan Lee - her paintings especially have a brightness and vividness to them that make them seem to leap out of the pages. She is a master at creating light - whether it be the light filtering through the woods, creating a path way of light, or the beautiful orange colours of the setting sun on the ocean as the frog prince crosses it on the back of a turtle. This is definitely a must have children's book, especially if you're a fan of the frog prince tale (try the Canon Movietale \\"The Frog Prince\\" starring Helen Hunt and Aileen Quinn) or moralistic stories of finding love below the surface (there are lots of similiarities here to the movie \\"Shrek\\" - even the colour green!) Highly recommended.<br />\\"Little green frog alone at night,<br />Beauty is in the beholder's sight.<br />Follow the sun, then follow me,<br />To lands beyond, across the sea.<br />In another kingdom you shall find,<br />A true princess, of a different mind.\\"but with side plots of escapes and quests, Alix Berenzy thankfully does not jam it down our throats, and it is shared without overly dramatising it.

After hearing of a game called \\"The Letter Game\\", Patricia Wrede and Caroline Stevermer decided to have a go - each took on the persona of two young women in a more magically favoured 1800's, and wrote to each other concerning their activities. Patrica Wrede plays the role of Cecelia Rushton, living in the country and somewhat envious of her cousin Kate Talgarth (Caroline Stevermer) who is being presented to Society in London. And so the correspondance began, each woman drawing on the magical angle of their created world as well as a 'Jane Austen' flavour, so tell each other of the gradually more dangerous escapades that they both get up to.<br />Kate in London is well into the process of socialising and mingling, despite being overshadowed by her far more beautiful sister Georgy. But whilst watching a neighbourhood wizard Sir Hilary being installed at the Royal College of Wizards, she comes across a little door in the building that leds to a cloistered garden, where a woman named Miranda Griscombe tries to kill her via chocolate poured from a bright blue chocolate pot! It becomes increasingly difficult when her cousin (Cecy's brother) Oliver disappears while at a night time function, and everywhere she goes she seems to run into the odious 'Mysterious Marquis', a one Thomas Schofield, whom seems to be the target of Miranda's malice.<br />Cecelia meanwhile has come into contract with Dorothea Griscombe (any relation to Miranda?) who unintentionally seems to attract men to her like flies to honey, in particular James Tarleton, who prowls around behind bushes and under trees with very little skill at such activities. Finding herself quite accomplished at the magical arts, despite her Aunt Elizabeth's hearty disapproval, Cecelia begins to take lessons, 'borrowing' several books from Sir Hilary's library which may lend clues to Kate's situation in London...<br />Such does the story go, expanding with each letter, with each girl helping the other along, though in the entire course of the tale neither of them come face to face. It is a highly original way of telling a story, and for the most part works very well in presenting a tale. If there is one trouble, it is that we are never in any concern over the girls' safety in their escapades, as we know that they remain intact in order to write the letters chronicling their dangers. Furthermore its difficult to keep track of the myraid of characters that keep pouring into the storyline and their relationships with one another - three-quarters of the way through the book I gave up and began again from the start!<br />But \\"Socery and Cecelia\\" (why Kate is excluded from the title is a mystery since I found her story and attitude far more enjoyable than Cecelia's) is a funny, witty, exciting read, filled with magic, interfering aunts, enchanted chocolate pots, romance, adventure and a certain tone that reminds us continually that it is real letters that we are reading - we never really find out what the story was behind that goat that the girls are continually alluding to!Sir Hilary's library which may lend clues to Kate's situation in London...<br />Such does the story go, expanding with each letter, with each girl helping the other along, though in the entire course of the tale neither of them come face to face.

It is gradually becoming clear in the general world of literature that fairytales in their original form were not at all intended for children, and the advent of sweet little fairytales, beginning with the Brothers Grimm and accumulating in the works of Enid Blyton, are gradually heading back to what they were originally used for - deep insights into the minds and souls of human beings as a whole. With that in mind, Francesca Lia Block perfectly captures their essence and meaning.<br />The cover art also captures this regard for fairytales - the front shows a beautiful young woman - but to turn the book around and see her lower half, one can see her hands are talons. Needless to say, this book is *not* for children.<br />There are nine tales in this volume, four of which are set in an entirely fairytale world, separate from our own, (Snow, Glass, Rose, Beast) and five of which are 'misplaced' fairytales, being played out in our contemporary world (Tiny, Charm, Wolf, Bones, Ice).<br />Snow is a retelling of Snow White, which highlights a new angle on the tale - bringing forth not the love of Snow White's mother or her lover, but that which the old stories always forget to mention - that of the affection between Snow and the seven dwarfs. My favourite quotes, first when the dwarfs look upon her as a baby \\"they knew then that she was the love they had been seeking in every face forever before this\\", and when it is pointed out \\"She loved them. This is what no one tells. She loved them.\\"<br />Tiny is a reworking of Thumbelina. A mother looses eight children to death, but her ninth child is the size of her thumb, though \\"there was a perfectly normal heartbeat flickering on the screen like a miniature star\\". Tiny grows, unaware of her difference, till she sees her first male - a young man, searching for his Muse. Falling in love, Tiny appoints herself a Hero, and goes after him...<br />Glass is a stunning retelling of Cinderella, in which our heroine is caught between the safety and predictability of her sisters, and the love she finds with her own Prince Charming. A natural storyteller, she is unawares of how easy she is to love, of her gift to transform, and of how she can change herself from sand into something clear and pure - like glass.<br />Charm is the dark and disturbing tale based on Sleeping Beauty, in which the spindle is a heroin needle, and thrown into a world of drugs, photographs and glamour. But in this case, Sleeping Beauty *cannot* sleep, and only one person in the world can help her find rest, and awaken her from her nightmare.<br />Wolf is Little Red Riding Hood, where a Stepfather takes the place of a wolf, and threatens the lives of a young girl and her mother. Running for the desert and her grandmother, the heroine finds that she has to face her greatest fear, when he turns up at her one place of sanctuary.<br />Rose is the tale of Rose White and Rose Red, the dearest of friends, and the inevitable breaking of their friendship when one of them falls in love. It is simple, heartbreaking and yet utterly true in its message - the everchanging role of love and connections with other people. If you are familiar with the story, you may be saddened by the loss of the character of the dwarf that hinders the girls so badly, but the great black bear is still intact.<br />Bones is perhaps the most ambigious of the stories simply because it is based on \\"Bluebeard\\", a tale that many may not know. The old story goes that a young woman marries Bluebeard who tells her she can go anywhere in the house expect in a particular room. Needless to say, the instant he leaves the house she open the door...and finds the bodies of his previous wives. In this case, Bluebeard is Derrick Blue, a talent scout who lures young women to his home in order to do what the original Bluebeard did. For a girl who begins wishing she was in a fairytale as \\"at least the girls in the stories were alive before they died\\", she ends vowing to listen to the tales of the 'bones' of the previous victims, and let their stories be known.<br />Beast is another favourite of mine, with the fascinating angle of having Beauty prefer the beast to the man he changes into. The imagery in this one is also beautiful, as Beauty becomes more and more wild and \\"tries to retrain herself from licking her hand as if it were a paw.\\"<br />But Francesca saves the best for last. In Ice, based on the Snow Queen, we meet two lovers utterly enveloped in each other, until K. is lured away by the perfect beauty of the Snow Queen. Francesca excells herself here with the potency of her words - a girl too afraid to fight for her love as she is convinced something as perfect as their love cannot possibily last, a boy trapped between two women, and of course, the regal Ice Queen that we've all met in our own lives at one time or another, and her ability to make us see the worst in ourselves.

Foremost is the love-tangle between the virtually indistinguishable Helena, Lysander, Hermia and Demetrius. When Hermia and Demetrius decide to elope, racing away into the woods, Lynsander follows (who has been promised Hermia by her father), and chasing after him is the spurned Helena, desparately (and pathetically) in love with him.<br />Meanwhile, the King and Queen of Fairies, Oberon and Titania are having what can only be called a domestic over a young changeling boy that Oberon wants to join his service, but who Titania is determined to keep in remembrance of his mother, her devoted friend. To punish his Queen, Oberon sends his servent, the hobgoblin Puck, to fetch a flower capable of making anyone under its spell fall in love with whatever creature they behold.<br />Finally, the group of players led by Peter Quince and joined by Francis Flute and the famous Nick Bottom journey into the forest to practice their play to perform on the Duke's wedding day, and fall the victims of Puck's prankish nature, when he transforms the head of Bottom into that of an ass. Of course, it is he that Titania first spies when she awakens from her slumber...<br />It is a complicated and intricate play, full of mayhem and havoc in which everybody falls in love with everybody else, but Coville handles it well and keeps it simple to the point of abridging much of the final act in which Bottom and the players finally get to perform. However, such a scene is somewhat un-neccessary in the \\"storybook\\" context of this retelling, and its removal was probably a good idea. The themes of wayward love and its fickleness is still in place, whether it be the mis-matching of the young lovers, the quarrels between husband and wife, or the ridiculousness of the romantic, suicidal couple that the actors play \\"Pyramus and Thisby\\" (on which Shakespeare based \\"Romeo and Juliet\\").<br />The illustrations fit the story well. Though some might hope for intricate, highly detailed work that we usually see in fairy-books these days (such as the work of Brian Froud or K. Y. Craft), here the watercolours are in soft pastels, very clearly and simply planned and rendered. To help the reader along, there is an introductory page of the main character's busts, and the four lovers can be easily identified by their colour-coding (just remember - the blonde girl goes with the blonde boy and the dark-haired girl goes with the dark-haired boy). Bottom is hilarious with or without his ass-head, and you can tell just from his expression that he's a complete buffon.<br />Most of the fairies are as they are usually portrayed - small, winged, barefooted and delicate, but their impish faces and spindly bodies save them from appearing as those silly, cute, adorable little fairies that you might expect in Enid Blyton. To my mind, fairies must have a little of the mysterious and potential for malevolence about them. The potrayal of Oberon and Titania is somewhat odd - Titania appears as a full grown woman (though in a couple of pictures horribly stick-like, almost anorexic) but Oberon seems almost child-like, as if he's a boy in an over-sized sheet. Like the four lovers, many of the characters are portrayed as incredibly young, a theme that runs through into Puck.<br />It isPuck who is the centrepiece of this retelling, both in the narrative and in the pictures. With tangled hair and a fuzzy loincloth, the cheeky toddler whizzes about the air, sometimes the very picture of innocence, other times with a devilish grin. He can't help but make you smile when you see him.<br />Altogether, a good start to introduce young readers to the play, with nice clear pictures just this side of an art and/or fairy-lovers collection.Puck who is the centrepiece of this retelling, both in the narrative and in the pictures.

In &quot;Windrider&quot; we learnt of the chance Betony was offered by the dragon Windrider to &quot;put down roots&quot; and become a dryad herself, and her friend's and family's efforts to bring her back into their world. Finally, in &quot;The Centre of Magic&quot; we are introduced to the wizard Colchis, who has been expelled from the Wizard's Guild in the next kingdom from Floramunde, and his search for power and revenge. Knowing that Floramunde is filled with Wild Magic rather than the less potent Human Magic, he crosses over in order to tap into its source and restrain it for himself.<br />To do so requires him to find the Centre of Magic in Floramunde - an ancient comet that crashed to the earth and became the founding of Floramunde's power. With this he adds two young dryad trees - mercilessly pulling them from their forest homes, and the power of necromancy to pull Wild Magic into his control. But the Centre of Magic is on the land of a farmer and his wife, and their children are quite curious as to what Colchis is getting up to - and so his experiment is interrupted at a crucial point, and the Wild Magic spills out over the land...<br />Meanwhile, the inhabitants of the palace are well aware of some of the mischief that Colchis has been up to. With the ability to hear and speak to the wind Betony, Salixia and their fairy godmother-and-gardener Rosie know that two dryads have been pulled from the soil and that trouble is brewing. Betony and her husband Basil set off to search for the uprooted trees, followed by Rosie's assistant Jo who has her own aspirations to conquer her fear and display heroics. But with the unleashing of Wild Magic upon the earth, there are some very unexpected side effects occuring - people are transforming into their true selves, whether it be a weasel, a centaur, a cat or a griffin. And most seem to be enjoying it - so what should the final decision of the three adventurers be? To reverse the magic, or to let people remain as they are? Perhaps Jo has the answer...<br />I will always be thankful I picked up &quot;The Willow Tree's Daughter&quot; at the library, as it swiftly became a favourite of mine with its clear, inventive stories, comic moments, and its ability to make astonishingly profound comments for what is considered 'children's books'. This trend continued into 'Windrider', but unfortunatly, though I still enjoyed it, I did not quite think 'The Centre of Magic' lived up to the first two books. Some characters did not appear as much as they did previously, such as Windrider, Ralph and Cassandra, and Clover did not appear at all! Furthermore, since the story was told from the point of view of Jo rather than Betony, the story seemed to be taking a different direction than normal.<br />However, the 'Floramunde' books are a rare treasure, and also they are not as sophisticated as Harry Potter, I loved their whimsey and the deep meanings to be found under the simplicity. Please, please, do yourself a favour and track these books down.e some very unexpected side effects occuring - people are transforming into their true selves, whether it be a weasel, a centaur, a cat or a griffin.

But Napoli presents the Grecian Sirens as mermaids - half-women, half-fish, a hybrid creature who are just as cursed as the men they destroy. Due to a spiteful nymph's curse, the mermaids are mortal until they can cause a man to fall in love with them and be their mate, thereby securing immortality for themselves (quite a change from the usual stories when falling in love means a heroine must *give up* her immortality). Thus, the heroine Sirena and her nine sisters spend each day on the lookout for ships, carrying precious men.<br />But when their plan of inticing the men to love them goes terribly wrong, and Sirena's younger sister is killed, she vows never to harm a human life in order to gain immortality and swims from her family and all that she's ever known, to the deserted island of Lemnos to live out her mortal life. But Fate it would seem has different ideas for Sirena, and when the Greek soldiers heading for the Trojan War abandon one of their men on the shores of Lemnos, the inevitable happens...<br />Philoctetes is a handsome young warrior, but the festering serpent wound upon his ankle has caused his fellow companions to discard him. Sirena cares for him, and Philoctetes is enchanted by the marvellous creature. But when warding off a dangerous she-bear with her song, Philoctetes overhears, and Sirena fears that their new-found love is based on nothing more than enchantment on his behalf. Throughout the years of the Trojan War the two live peacefully together, intellectually debating issues such as honour and glory, and sharing many stories together of well-placed Greek mythology. Yet Sirena mourns - Philoctetes love has made her immortal, yet he is not, and she can see the signs of age appear on his day by day. And it would seem he and his poisonous arrows still have a part to play in the far-off raging Trojan War...<br />It's hard to imagine any fans of Donna Jo Napoli not enjoying this accompaniment to her steadily growing collection of re-told tales. Calling on Greek mythology that she adds in throughout the story, and much of her own ideas, such as the gaining of mermaid mortality, Napoli creates a familiar yet fresh presentation of old ideas. Her language, told in first-person narrative through Sirena's eyes is vivid and atmospheric - her creation of life in the sea, and Sirena's explorations up in the rivers of the island are especially enjoyable. Anyone with fore-knowledge about the Trojan War and Philoctetes' part to play within it may already know how the story ends, and may be already shedding a tear, but either way, this is a powerful, beautiful, tragic story about the giving and receiving of love, life and sacrifice.Philoctetes love has made her immortal, yet he is not, and she can see the signs of age appear on his day by day.

In \\"Willow's Daughter\\" the reader learnt of the love between the High King Max and his wife Salixia. Once a dryad, Max's love for Salixia saved her when her tree was destroyed, and together they had a daughter named Betony. Betony had the heritage of a dryad within her, and after a visit from the dragon Windrider, she learnt that one day she might have the opportunity to \\"put down roots\\" and fully become a tree spirit. But with her engagement to her beloved friend Basil the gardener's boy, all thoughts of that seemed lost...<br />Until now. In \\"Windrider\\", the magnificent dragon comes once more to the kingdom of Floramonde, to once again offer Betony the choice of rulership or of freedom in the high country. Realising her ties to her family and friends, Betony declines, but then her father meets the fatal gaze of the dragon's eye... To look directly into the eye of the dragon has an odd effect on a human being - they become a part of the Wild Magic, forgetting their name, stealing away their hearts, and having only a desire to be free from human restraints. Such is what happens to King Max, and it is now up to Betony to go in search of Windrider to release her father and save her mother, for without the life-giving love of Max, and with her tree destroyed, Salixia can find no reason to live, and begins to waste away.<br />So begins the quest - Betony must pass through the Dark Forest of Nevermore in search of Windrider, but finds along the way the dryad Ulmus, who offers to teach her the secrets of her forest-heritage: how to talk to the wind and the trees. Soon Betony finds that her gifts with Wild Magic are quite wonderful things - perhaps she *does* want to become a dryad after all. Mindful of such worries, her betrothed Basil and her best friend the witch-in-training Clover have followed her into the woods, but they'll have to face dangers of their own (such as a shape-changing troll and a dying oak tree) if they want to reach Betony in time before she's lost to them forever.<br />Amoung new characters are our old favourites - Ralph, Rosie, Cassandra, as well as new creatures: the Chimera, the hill men, Corvus and more, all mingling together in this simple but beautiful book. Be sure to follow up with the remaining installment \\"The Centre of Magic\\".<br />In the wake of the Harry Potter books, many other fantasy books are either being gobbled up by young readers or completely ignored - such is the blessing or curse of being an author writing in the shadow of a hugely popular success. As much as I do like the Harry Potter books, I don't think its wise to completely refrain yourself from reading only them and no others. If you like fantasy, but are looking for a swifter, lighter, fresher read, then please try the Floramunde books. The writing is elegant and poetic, and though they are nowhere as complex as the Harry Potter books, they carry the same messages of love, courage and friendship, as well as deeper shades of the mysterious and the profound (to be found in the last pages of \\"Windrider\\").son to live, and begins to waste away.<br />So begins the quest - Betony must pass through the Dark Forest of Nevermore in search of Windrider, but finds along the way the dryad Ulmus, who offers to teach her the secrets of her forest-heritage: how to talk to the wind and the trees.

Finally, after what seems like centuries of waiting, \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\" is available! And was it worth the wait? The answer is a resounding YES! With everything one has come to expect from J. K. Rowling, the wizarding world is expanded and the tension heightens as Harry Potter and his friends face new and even more difficult challenges in what is the darkest book yet in the series.<br />After a nearly an entire summer of waiting, Harry is frustrated and nearly frantic with the lack of news that has come forth in regard to the newly risen Lord Voldemort, and it is soon apparent that \\"The Order of the Phoenix\\" has a very different tone than the previous books. There is no mischief making at the Dursleys, no shopping sprees in Diagon Alley, no joyful reunion with his friends - everything here has a sense of tension bordering on desparation as Harry is whisked away from the Dursleys to his godfather Sirius's house after an attack on himself and his cousin by two grim Dementors.<br />The darkening of the plot line continues even into the personality of Harry himself, as Rowling highlights his shortcomings and his potential for failure with his steadily growing frustration, impatience, resentment toward his friends and even a few touches of arrogance - after all, hasn't it been *he* who has saved the day so often in the past? And yet on top of all this, he must still make room for the less magical components of his life - his missing out on becoming a Prefect, the dreaded end of year exams, and the terror of coming face to face with your crush. And what do his new dreams mean - of walking down an empty corridor toward a multitude of doors at its end?<br />In a change that some readers may not have been expecting after the conclusion of \\"the Goblet of Fire\\", the main enemy of \\"the Order of the Phoenix\\" is not Voldemort at all, but the Ministry of Magic, staunch in its belief that Voldemort has not returned and that Harry is simply an hallucinatingattention-seeker. Led by Cornelius Fudge, believing that Dumbledore is a threat to his position, and helped by an estranged Percy Weasley, the Ministry is determined to make things as difficult as possible for the Order of the Phoenix by positioning a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher amoung the ranks at Hogwarts: one Dolores Umbridge. Using all the wiles of propaganda, manipulation, corporeal punishment and backing from a stronger source, this infuriating woman imposes a strict, regimented regime on staff and students alike, turning Hogwarts into the worst of dictatorships. It is an incredibly well-written allegory on the workings of tyranny, dictatorship and control in our own world, both past and present, and of the evils of a number of social afflictions: prejudice, segregation, fixed justice systems, media frenzy, secret police, withholding of information - everything that could go wrong with a government or administration of any sort is incapsulated here in the Ministry of Magic's attitude.<br />As you may have already guessed, Harry, Ron and Hermione are not going to take this sort of restrictions on their beloved Hogwarts sitting down, and soon are fighting fire with fire, whether it be the the formation of \\"Dumbledore's Army\\", the blackmailing of ex-reporter Rita Skeeter to get Harry's story into the open, the maliciousness of Peeves put to good use, or the heightened and increasingly elaborate pranks of Fred and George Weasley. When the students decide to take back the school, it results in some of the funniest comic sequences I have ever read - J. K. Rowling's sense of humour is hilarious!<br />Female readers are now in for a treat - if there has been one critism posed at the Harry Potter books, it is the lack of females characters. Though there are some disagreements to this, it must be noted that with the expection of Hermione and McGonagall, all the major players in the books are male: Dumbledore, Harry, Ron, Sirius, Snape, Lupin, Dobby, Hagrid, Malfoy...but now a new range of females have been ushered forward. Older characters such as Mrs Weasley, Ginny, Cho Chang and McGonagall play larger roles than previously, while new females from all walks of life make their first appearences - Nymphalia Tonks, the shape-shifting Order member, Bellatrix Lestrange, the evil Death Eater, and of course the Ministry member Dolores Umbride, a character so infuriating you'll be wanting to throttle your book.<br />In many ways \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" is vastly different from its predecessors: Hogwarts is no longer the centre of the action, as the Order members are 'out there' doing battle with Voldemort, the tone and content is much darker and complex, and there is a lot less involvement in the plot from major characters - Dumbledore, Hagrid, Malfoy and Dobby do not appear as often as they usually have. But Rowling does bring us what she promised - a deeper look into the wizarding world (in particular the Ministry of Magic headquarters and St Mungo Hospital) and the re-arrival of many familiar faces - Lupin, Firenze, Mad-Eye Moody, and more. No Harry Potter fan should be disappointed with the latest installment in his story, the only problem is facing yet another long wait until #6!	2003-06-23

Though I don't fit into that age group anymore, the books in the Dark Enchantment series are nice, quick reads, perfect for cold wintry nights by the fire, just complex enough to hold my interest.<br />In &quot;The Hounds of Winter&quot;, young Jansie is heartbroken when her older sister Tavia marries Silvan, partly because her beloved sister will now be living miles away, and partly because Jansie herself is in love with the dashing, prince-like Silvan. But after the Winter Solstice, Jansie is invited to Silvan's huge and isolated house to keep her sister company while he is away on business, and she is shocked by her sister's hollow and frail appearence. When questioning Gilmer, the charming and cheerful stewart, he tells her somewhat reluctantly that she has been suffering nightmares recently, awakening from sleep screaming of a terrible hound. And soon Jansie experiences them for herself - was it just her imagination, or did she hear a strange shuffling noise like an animal outside her door? And the howling about the house - what is that?<br />Gilmer tells her the tale of the ghostly pack of hounds that is said to haunt the woods, a dozen or so pure white dogs, with a leader of pitch black. Together, they are called the Hounds of Winter, and most of the village is terrified of them. And then even odder things start happening - messages pleading for help are etched in the snow, Tavia and Silvan are bickering, and a feeling of foreboding falls all upon the house.<br />Mystery upon mystery piles up - what is the meaning of the inscription on the bronze sword? And of the painting in the tower? What are the strange white hounds? What is Silvan's terrible secret?<br />A simple yet intriging story, good for reluctant readers, and with a somewhat sad, but vital message at its end. With a spooky atmosphere and range of mysterious events, most will keep on reading right till the very last page. &quot;The Hounds of Winter&quot; is probably the best of the &quot;Dark Enchantment&quot; series, and is also published under the title &quot;Heart of Ice&quot;. If you like the moody, tone, content and surroundings of this book, I'd also suggest &quot;The Darkangel&quot; by Meredith Ann Pierce, and the television production of &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; based on the book by Arthur Conan Doyle and starring Richard Roxburgh.message at its end.

As told in \\"The Dark Angel\\", the story is of Aerial, a simple slave in a wealthy household whose mistress Eoduin was captured by one of the dreaded winged vampyres, who drink the blood and steals the souls of women. Aerial followed her mistress, becoming a servent in the Irrylath's house, and to her horror, eventually being chosen to be his last bride. But with the help of the dwarf-like duarough Talb and a magical drought, she restored the darkangel to humanity by literally exchanging hearts with him, and returned him to his mother's house.<br />And now Aerial is appointed another task set to her by the deceased spirits of the brides: to seek out the missing lons, the powerful animal-like wardens of the land who have long been missing, most likely due to the designs of the White Witch, the maker of the darkangels, who still haunts Irrylath's dreams. Despairing of her husband's inability to love her, Aerial takes up the task and sets off on a journey to the temple of the sibyl in her own homeland to unravel the mystery of an ancient riddle that will help her find the missing lons. Armed with a dark staff with a heron passenger, she not only seeks the lons, but unknowingly finds the secrets of her own past, and her role in the destiny that follows in the war against the Witch.<br />Unlike \\"The Darkangel\\", which was created in more of a circular narrative in the fairytale motifs of capture, trial and restoration (much like in 'Sleeping Beauty' or 'Snow White'), \\"A Gathering of Gargoyles\\" is a voyaging novel, with an ultimate goal hindered by several obstacles. And these obstacles, far from dragging the story on, are fascinating: a sail across a Sea-of-Dust, hidden danger in a City of Thieves, a chase through a dark forest filled with night-haunts, the rescue of a rather unusual maiden sacrifice, a time of being held in captivity by a man who has sold his own name, the relighting of a great lighthouse, and finally, with the meeting of two familiar characters from the first book - one good and one evil - the climax of the quest.<br />Although the premise may look silly written down, perhaps seeming to belong to a trashy vampiric-romance paperback, I assure you it is *not*. Meredith Pierce creates a world with depth and resonance, perfectly mingling together elements of many cultures - the German loreleis, the European gargoyles, the Grecian sphinx - into a familiar, yet totally unique blend. Unlike many fantasy authors -and Tolkien imitators- these days, who feel as if they must cram detail upon detail into their books in order to make it seem realistic (but only succeeding in making them encyclopedic), Pierce creates exotic worlds and its wildlife with barely any effort; a different way of keeping time, a new range of foods and plants (including 'hungerspice', 'nightfruit', and 'winesheath') and vivid descriptions of scenery that do not inflict directly on the story or slow it down, but simply serve to convincingly create an entire world separate from this one. Likewise, she keeps in mind the separate sects of her land, as in different countries the terrain and communities change, as does the language - in one place a darkangel is called an 'icarus', and in another it is called a 'seraph'. All is told in an elegant and simple tone, as if Pierce is retelling a story, giving the book an air of being an ancient folklore retold.<br />Much of the charm of the books is the heroine, Aerial herself. In a 'polically correct' world where authors feel as if female protagonists must be able to swing a sword in order to be considered 'strong female characters' equal to males, it is wonderful to discover a resourceful, intelligent, compassionate, strong-willed female who experiences hardship and triumphs over the odds without once resorting to violence (expect a couple of self-defensive manuveurs with a staff). Such heroines are increasingly getting harder to come by, but are always more realistic and interesting to female *and* male readers. I for one would have absolutely no clue what to do if someone handed me a sword, and Aerial, with her faults and virtues is a pleasure to read of.<br />The entire story reads like an old, dark fairytale, with traditional elements given new life - an invisibility cloak, magic fruit, a damsel to be sacrificed, a sacrificial stone - all sound like utter cliches, but are deliberatly presented here in such originality that it is if you are reading of them for the first time. These books have my highest recommendation - everything about them appealed to me, from the content to the underlying themes to the style of the writing. Why these books remain largely unknown is a mystery to me, as Meredith Ann Pierce's talent as a storyteller is right up there with the masters of the fantasy genre.female who experiences hardship and triumphs over the odds without once resorting to violence (expect a couple of self-defensive manuveurs with a staff).

US	39424751	RV2DU60OEQ2P1	0884896692	9003311	Malkin (StarMaker Books)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	A Princess in Rags, a Dress of Feathers, a Tale Retold...	\\"Malkin\\" (also published as \\"Cold Iron\\") would seem on the surface to have the rag-and-tatter clad Princess as its protagonist, shut away from her grieving grandfather's sight due to his beloved daughter's death at her birth. But it soon becomes clear, that the centre stage does not belong to the Lady Susanna (nicknamed Tattercoats because of her garb), but to her servent and friend Malkin, who would seem to be a mere serving maid in the house of the Baron. The story is told from her point of view, and as the tale progresses, we see that her own unique gifts and mysterious heritage is even more fascinating than the mistreated Tattercoats.<br />But Tattercoats is the key figure in motivating Malkin and the adventure that follows - when the forgotten Princess is invited to Queen Elizabeth's godson's birthday celebration Malkin and the gooseherd Pug are determined that she should inherit her birthright, and perhaps catch the eye of the young Earl of Malmsey. Pug directs Malkin in the fetching of a glorious bundle buried in the garden - a dress of feathers, a cap of moss, and two shoes of pleated grass. The trio set off towards court, gathering on the way the ministrel Gallimaufry, the drummer Tabor and the apothecary Pennyroyal.<br />But other forces are also on the move - the sinister, peacock-like Italian magician Oscuro who is the latest employee of the Baron to find his lost daughter, and who gives Malkin the chills, the glamour and strange workings of the gooseherd Pug, and even deeper magics in the form of the 'Other Country', and the creatures that dwell within it.<br />Sophie Masson mingles the old English fairytale \\"Tattercoats\\" (retold at the end of the book in her own words), the Shakespearean play \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\", and a bit of real English history to create a lovely story that is both new and familiar, touching on age old themes and ideas. Her poetic prose is beautiful to read, capturing every aspect from descriptions of scenery to human emotions elegantly and realistically. In Malkin, she has a strong, captivating heroine, gradually discovering the secrets to her past, and interacting well with those around her.<br />Although Pug (does that name ring a bell? - you've probably already guessed who he is with the mention of a Midsummer Night's Dream) is a nice, enigmatic character, Tattercoats is a little *too* good to be true, and didn't really hold my interest. She sighs in her unhappiness, giggles innocently in her joy and plays the damsel in distress one too many times for her to have any sort of character depth. I much prefer the less-perfect Malkin who has her moments of doubt, jealousy and frustration. Likewise, I could not really see the point of the trio's travelling companions Gallimaufry, Tabor or Pennyroyal - whenever they were in the action the pace tended to slow considerably, and they served no particular function so far as I could see, but to tag along (and their lack of reaction to the magical glamour around them was rather mind-boggling).

Again, I was more eager to get back to Malkin, and Sophie Masson could have gotten on much better with her original trio of travellers.<br />However, this is a great little book, beautifully written and created, filled with both old and new ideas, that Massonn shares with the reader in her 'Afterword' at the back of the book. Teachers or parents might be interested in using this book to introduce the Shakespeare play, or perhaps touch on Elizabethan history, but readers who love re-shaped or mingled fairytales will find little to complain about here. If you like this, I definitly recommend \\"The Perilous Gard\\", which is in much the same vein as \\"Malkin\\".s elegantly and realistically. In Malkin, she has a strong, captivating heroine, gradually discovering the secrets to her past, and interacting well with those around her.<br />Although Pug (does that name ring a bell? - you've probably already guessed who he is with the mention of a Midsummer Night's Dream) is a nice, enigmatic character, Tattercoats is a little *too* good to be true, and didn't really hold my interest. She sighs in her unhappiness, giggles innocently in her joy and plays the damsel in distress one too many times for her to have any sort of character depth. I much prefer the less-perfect Malkin who has her moments of doubt, jealousy and frustration. Likewise, I could not really see the point of the trio's travelling companions Gallimaufry, Tabor or Pennyroyal - whenever they were in the action the pace tended to slow considerably, and they served no particular function so far as I could see, but to tag along (and their lack of reaction to the magical glamour around them was rather mind-boggling).

US	39424751	R11ELUP1RUE4Y8	0027858618	478988734	Heart of Valor	Books	3	2	3	N	N	"I Don't Think Things Can Ever Go Back to the Way They Were..."	\\"Heart of Valor\\" is set a year and a half after the events of [[ASIN:1416998403 The Night of the Solstice]], in which four siblings helped the sorceress Morgana Shee prevent an evil sorcerer from invading the world through her house of magic mirrors. At the conclusion of the book, the doorways to the Wildworld were closed, the sorcerer was destroyed, and his ally Thia Pendriel managed to escape with the immensely powerful Heart of Valor, a magical gemstone.<br /><br />All has been quiet since then, with the quirky Janie studying magic under Morgana's guidance, shy Claudia enjoying her newfound gift to speak to animals, and Alys and Charles simply getting on with their lives. But after what seems like a typical Californian earthquake, the children and the sorceress begin to suspect that Thia is up to something; perhaps trying to re-open the portal between the Wildworld and the Stillworld. Morgana hurries north in order to find her, whilst the children face dangers of their own. The park is filled with strange creatures, bizarre signs can be seen in the sky, and their house is attacked by groups of strange elementals.<br /><br />With the sword Caliborn in her possession, giving Alys dreams of ancient Arthurian lore, she and her siblings hurry to find Morgana and help prevent Thia from whatever she's planning next...<br /><br />This book and its predecessor were the first novels written by L.J. Smith, now best known for [[ASIN:0061963860 The Vampire Diaries]] and the [[ASIN:1416974504 Night World]] series, after she moved from fantasy to the supernatural-romance genre. Though it makes for an interesting read, it's clear that this is a first-time effort from a newbie author, especially when compared with her later, more polished, works. The most glaring problem is the narrative of the book; quite simply, it's a confusingly told story that's hard to keep track of. Despite pages and pages of exposition, we never seem to have a clear idea of what's going on or why, with a lot of capitalized terms thrown about that are virtually meaningless (including the Elixir of Days, the Mirror of Heaven, the Forgotten Gems, the Chaotic Zones, Gold Staffs, White Staffs, Black Staffs, the Weerul Council, the Golden Age of Findahl - the list goes on).<br /><br />After conveniently disposing of the children's parents via an overseas voyage, the children do not participate in much of the action till over halfway through the book when they go after Morgana, and the events occurring in the Wildworld (when things should get *really* interesting) are jammed into the last few chapters of the book. The world-building is rather clumsy, with concepts and plot devices popping out of nowhere, and nothing properly explained. Perhaps a reader will be on more stable ground if they've recently read [[ASIN:1416998403 The Night of the Solstice]], but ultimately `Heart of Valor' reads a bit like alphabet soup: muddled.<br /><br />There was a good story here, but L.J. Smith wasn't quite accomplished enough to tell it properly. The recent resurgence of interest in her work means the republication of her older books, but it's a pity she wasn't given the opportunity to rewrite them a little as well to iron out some of the glitches. Still, fans of her later books may enjoy recognizing several ideas that she recycles in her other books, such as a dog attack that resembles the one in [[ASIN:0061963860 The Vampire Diaries]], Claudia's ability to talk to animals being reminiscent of Anna Whiteraven's gift in [[ASIN:B004TE793Y Dark Visions]], and the use of the name Thia in [[ASIN:1416974504 Night World]] (though with different spelling).<br /><br />If in the last book you thought the name \\"Morgana Shee\\" rang a bell, your suspicions will be put to rest here. In the Arthurian legends that L. J. Smith mixes into this book, Morgana plays the part of Morgan LeFay *and* the Lady of Lake, set against the tricky and somewhat malevolent Merlin. It's an interesting re-working of the oldmyths, one that she successfully ties in with her own mythos.<br /><br />On their own terms this book and its predecessor as rather sub-par fantasy stories, but for fans of Smith who hold an interest in the evolution of her writing, they make for novelty reading. She's obviously come a long way since these early days, and I enjoyed having a taste of how she began her writing career.h her own mythos.

Beginning with 'Prophesies', and moving through 'Dark Times' and 'The Vampire King' Golden gives himself the freedom to do what he likes with the characters (including killing them) by instigating a plot device that has nineteen year old Buffy hurtled into the future to her twenty-five year old body, fighting in an post-apocalyptic Sunnydale ruled over by Giles, the Vampire King. All this is due to a fatal mistake she made in her college years, and the course of 'Original Sins' can be divided into two: Buffy going up against Giles, and Buffy attempting to rectify her long-ago mistake.<br />Also on the scene are her former friends - the powerful sorceress Willow (who plays the largest part in the story after Buffy herself), the hardened warrior Xander, and the werewolf Oz hovering between humanity and animalistic tendencies. Along with the Watcher's Council and the latest Slayer Anna Keui (who doesn't play any sort of meaningful part in the action) they go up against Giles and the demon-god Camazotz, previously a dangerous foe, now just a battery for the Kakchiquels (vampires that fed on his mystical energy). Despite a rather potent scene that has Buffy fighting between what Golden describes as &quot;the two men she loved most&quot; - the vampiric Giles and a trapped Angel, the final showdown with her former Watcher is somewhat anti-climatic, and all that follows with Willow and former-Slayer Lucy Hanover sending Buffy back into the past has absolutely no edge to it, simply because everybody *knows* that things will get back to normal. Such is the problem with writing a book set in an already-established plot line - you can't develop anybody or anything.<br />&quot;The Lost Slayer&quot; was a vaugely entertaining read, but after volume one, there was no way you could read them out of order without becoming utterly lost. I suggest the publication that has all four books in one volume so that one doesn't have to hunt all over the place for the next installment in the series (one of the things I hate about any kind of book that isn't self-contained). There's an interesting look in the future of what *could* one day happen, but nothing we haven't seen in episodes in television such as &quot;The Wish&quot; in Season Three, and eventually Golden's killing off of practically every character for no other reason but simply because he *could* got tiring. By the end, I was skim reading in order to get to the finish. By all means, give it a try, but don't feel bad if you have to return it to the library before you're done.ing utterly lost.

After a slow but promising start in \\"Prophesies\\" and a fast-paced, exciting second installment \\"Dark Times\\", the third part of Christopher Golden's Lost Slayer serial begins to drift away from any coherent plot, becoming no better or worse than the myraid of fan fiction out there based on Buffy the Vampire Slayer (except the fan fiction is free).<br />Due to the designs of the demon-goddess Zotzilaha, Buffy has been catapulted five years into the future where her past and future souls merge in the body into her twenty-five year old self who has escaped from the high-facility prison in which she was kept and found Sunnydale to be ruled by vampires. Forced to kill the second Slayer August (Faith's successor) Buffy is reunited with her friends who have also been changed in the five years she's been held prisoner. Here Golden makes some rather remarkable predictions about the character's future personalities: Willow's incredible power as a witch, Oz's inability to fully surpress his werewolfry, Wesley's new kick-butt attitude, Faith's redemption - these are but a few of the accurate soon-to-be fates of the Scooby gang on the television show.<br />But despite these interesting points, the plot soon begins to waver. Buffy learns that due to the mistake she made over five years ago concerning the bat-god Camazotz and her Watcher Giles, she herself is responsible for all that has come to pass. Giles is now a vampire himself, sporting the rather ridiculous title of 'King of the Vampires', and his goal is to turn Buffy herself into a vampire. Also on the scene is the new Vampire Slayer, Anna Kuei, who serves no real purpose in the story that I can see, and Spike whose death is equally pointless, especially since he rather stupidly walks into the Watcher's compound to give them information they already knew. And what exactly was his escape plan...?<br />The basis of the story is Buffy joining forces with the Watcher's Council and her old friends to go up against Giles and his minions. The whole 'two souls in one body' nicely contrasts the theme of the former books in which Buffy-the-person tries to separate herself from Buffy-the-Slayer, but all tension over this is lost, as Golden continually informs us that the rightful soul will eventually return to the nineteen year old Buffy. There's a nifty Buffy physic dream and a pretty cool twist involving a priest and fire sprinklers in the ceiling, but other times the story falls short of expectations - a fighter named Yancy is introduced as a somewhat irratic killer (aha! I thought, there's the turncoat!) but is needlessly killed off before he plays any sort of impact in the story.<br />Basically, a quick, mildly entertaining read, but with too much descriptions on endless fighting and unlikely what-if senarios to be taken seriously.minions.

He is only one of a huge group of Magids situated in the entire Multiverse, which is set in a figure-eight pattern, half of which is low on magic (situated Naywards from the centre), and half of which is populated by all sorts of magical creatures (Ayewards). The centre of the Multiverse is the Empire of Koryfos, the govenment system that everyone - especially Rupert - loves to hate. However, when an assassin's bomb goes off, killing the emperor and most of his court, Koryfos is thrown into civil war. The emperer left barely any clues as to who his children and heirs were, and with the gradual realisation that a conspiracy is afoot, Rupert is called in to help track these heirs.<br />But Rupert has problems of his own; he's bogged down trying to track down five potential Magids to take on as a student after the death of his own mentor Stan. After spending days looking for one infuriating potential Maree Mallory, he's fed up, and tangles with the fatelines of the other four to bring them to the Babylon hotel in Wantchester to participate in a Science Fiction Convention. Needless to say, when these two plot lines collide, chaos of every kind explodes across the pages.<br />Told in first-person narrative through either Rupurt or Maree, Wynne Jones gives us her usual, but always welcome components found in practically all of her books. Her heroes are always a delight; there are never any charming, attractive, innately 'good' figures here, our protagonists are a short-tempered, harried man whose career choice could translate basically in a magical govenment official, and a dumpy, half-blind, gloomy university student. The two of them bounce wonderfully off each other, and their wry, matter-of-fact, (and sometimes melodramatic) views on the world are blissfully refreshing.<br />In typical Diana Wynne Jones fashion she treats the fantasy world as nothing out of the ordinary, which can often be quite confusing for first time readers of her style, and it is sometimes her downfall that she jumps straight into the story with little or no background - readers have to pick up the pieces of the story as they go along, and in this case the beginning few chapters are a bit sluggish. It does not get *really* interesting until the convention, and all the previous talk on the Empire and Rupert's computer hacking slows down the pace considerably.<br />I've never actually been to a convention of any kind, much less a science-fiction one, so I can only assume that her parady on names, activities and confusion that takes place there is dead on the button. What struck me more deeply was her digs at some 'professional' writers who see books as machines - you know, those authors that chug out book after book without any imagination or creativity, and without any real differences in their publications.<br />To a point, it sometimes felt as if Wynne Jones herself had unknowingly fallen into this trap. As a long-time reader of her work, I couldn't help but feel as if I'd read this book before. All her usual strategies (parallel worlds, magical manipulation, etc) were in place, and did anyone who's read her most famous works - the 'Chrestomanci' series for kids - pick up a certain resemblance between the Magids and the Chrestomanci? Perhaps she was betting on the fact that her new adult readers haven't read these particular books, but the two are very similar in occupation, in which they use magical means to keep the world in line. *And* I was very surprised in her revelation concerning who the Emperer's main successor to the Koryfos throne was - simply because it was so predictable! 'The missing heir to the throne' plot device is something she herself has mocked in her 'Tough Guide to Fantasyland' parady on the fantasy genre, and yet she actually uses it here!<br />But all in all, a fun, entertaining read; certainly not her best work, and not entirely different from many of her children's books (expect with a few more adult jokes, and a massacre that certainly *doesn't* fit in with the light-hearted story she was previously telling), but anyone who is a fan of hers should be satisfied. Have the sequel \\"The Merlin Conspiracy\\" close by.ssing heir to the throne' plot device is something she herself has mocked in her 'Tough Guide to Fantasyland' parady on the fantasy genre, and yet she actually uses it here!<br />But all in all, a fun, entertaining read; certainly not her best work, and not entirely different from many of her children's books (expect with a few more adult jokes, and a massacre that certainly *doesn't* fit in with the light-hearted story she was previously telling), but anyone who is a fan of hers should be satisfied.

Aiken provides the story, based in old legends and folklore, and Lee works magic with his watercolours to create a deep and evocative atmosphere, while at the same time keeping a sense of realism to the tale.<br />Seppy is the seventh son of a seventh son in a family that makes carriages - but his only wish is to become a wonderful violinist like his grandfather. To find out how to succeed in this path, he goes one night to an abandoned house where bodiless voices are said to whisper to one another, and ask for their advice. They tell him that all he needs to do is throw a shoe at the moon each night for a week. Baffled, Seppy obeys, but finds that after marring the moon's beautiful white face with the marks of his shoes, it imposes on him a terrible revenge: in return for success as a fiddler, he must go barefoot for seven years, his sister will never speak a word, and he and his family will be in terrible danger.<br />Sure enough, any shoe that is placed on Seppy's feet instantly falls apart, his new-born sister Octavia never utters a word, and the portents begin brewing that something terrible is on its way... But throughout all this Seppy's talent as a violinist grows to magical proportions, and his skill with his new violin (given to him through ghostly means) may just hold the key to protecting not only his family, but the entire seaport he lives in.<br />If there is a fault in this tale, it is that Joan Aiken emcompasses too many strands of plot into what should be a more simple folktale. As it is, one is never quite clear what is the main story line - is it the Moon's curse? Seppy's musical development? The threat of the sea monster? As well as this, several small enigmas presented in the story are never completely unwound, and though some - like the formless voices in the abandoned house - are best left mysteries, other just make it seem as if the book has drifted to an incomplete ending. For instance, how and why does Octavia begin to speak? Why does the monster shrink? How do the shoes get back in the clock?<br />But despite these confusions, the stunning illustrations of Alan Lee more than make up for them; he is the only artist to my knowledge that can make a dancing sea serpent in giant shoes look completely realistic. He invokes the moorlands and the seaport perfectly, either by day or under the ghostly light of the moon, and any complaints over the story are swept away by the mysterious mood of the watercolours - ghostly kings, crashing waves, mist-shrouded beaches, craggy rocks, and of course the seaweed covered sea serpent are all completely convincing and provocative. Lee captures movement, scenery, action, stillness and otherworldliness perfectly, and any fans of his work will not be disappointed with his illustrations here.<br />So even though the move from the haunting, murky atmosphere of the first half of the book doesn't quite match the cartoonish feel of a dancing sea monster at its conclusion, the prose is strong enough, and the illustrations beautiful enough, to make this book a treasure for the bookshelf.ries, other just make it seem as if the book has drifted to an incomplete ending.

She's there under the power of the Kakchiquels, the energy-sucking vampires that serve the demon-god Camazotz, and they're about to change her grim existence: into her cell is thrown August the Vampire Slayer, Faith's successor to the Slayer line. August decides that their only choice is to kill one another so that another Slayer might be called out in the world, but Buffy is more concerned with escaping her jail. After a fight (and I won't give away the results), Buffy flees the compound into a grim world she could never have comprehended. Sunnydale is a ruined city, with the vampires performing not like animals, but as an organised group, and some humans as their willing slaves. But who could have such power and charisma to hold sway over what are essentially individualistic creatures?<br />Meanwhile, back in the present Willow, Xander, Anya and Oz are torn between going to save the captured Giles (taken by Camazotz's henchmen in the previous book) or going after the unidentified Prophet, who has taken over Buffy's body and has a secret adjenda of her own.<br />You could probably get away with understanding this book without reading its predecessor \\"Prophesies\\", as most details are repeated here, and most of it is pretty straightforward anyway. It is definitly an improvement on \\"Prophesies\\", fast-paced and action-packed, with another large twist at the end that shakes the situation up a bit. There are more cute cameo roles, predominantly that of Parker Abrams, but I found the inclusion of Spike (pre-chipped and pre-souled) and Drusilla to be rather pointless, it feels as if Golden simply put them as they're  popular, and I personally felt that their decision to be a part of the regimented vampire world was way out of character for both of them.<br />The time-travelling/parallel time stream idea confused me (but those types of things always do), and I get the grim feeling that Golden's going to pull a 'deux ex machina' in order to put things back the way they were, something that is *never* good - kind of like when a character puts themselves in a bad position only to wake up and find it was all a dream.<br />Finally there were a few glitches that really annoyed me - August's decision she has to kill Buffy in order to activate a new Slayer was completely useless. If you are a long-time fan of the show you'll know that when Buffy died by drowning at the end of Season One, her temporary death caused Kendra to be called into the role of Slayer. After Kendra's death Faith was called. Buffy could die and be resurrected a thousand times to no effect - *the Slayer line lies with Faith*. True, it's possible that August didn't realise this, but Buffy certainly did, and she does not even attempt to explain August's folly to her.<br />Furthermore, when Buffy is driving towards her pick-up point, she serves to miss two vampires and sees them giving her obscene gestures in the rear-vision mirror - since when did vampires have reflections? I can't believe that particular flaw slipped through!<br />All in all, a light, interesting read, but no better or worse than some of the fan-fiction out there that can be read for free.ecision to be a part of the regimented vampire world was way out of character for both of them.<br />The time-travelling/parallel time stream idea confused me (but those types of things always do), and I get the grim feeling that Golden's going to pull a 'deux ex machina' in order to put things back the way they were, something that is *never* good - kind of like when a character puts themselves in a bad position only to wake up and find it was all a dream. <br />Finally there were a few glitches that really annoyed me - August's decision she has to kill Buffy in order to activate a new Slayer was completely useless.

For those who take the time to read more luxeriously and deeply, they will find layer upon layer of meaning, symbolism, motivations and psychological breakdown that is simply intoxicating to discover. Underlying all of this is the concept of deep and powerful love, and its conflicting abilities to both nourish and destroy.<br />Set in the mountains of Switzerland in the mid-1500s, Rapunzel \\"Zel\\" lives an isolated and innocent existence with her mother in their small farm, finding joy in such simple pleasures as visits into town and her birthday celebrations. But when her mother leaves her at the smithy, Zel comes into contact with her first male influence - the Prince Konrad who is immediatly captivated by her golden hair and pretty face. But if there is one thing that her mother will never allow it is for her most beloved daughter to be taken away from her. As Konrad anguishes away in a hopeless search for his heart's desire, Zel is whisked away from all contact from the human world - to a stone tower deep in the forest, with no way of escape.<br />The story is told through three viewpoints, that of Rapunzel and the Prince (told in third-person narrative) and of Zel's mother, made more intimate through her speaking directly to the reader. The three stories intertwine in a braid as tight as Rapunzel's hair as they struggle against their own personal desires and the conflicting emotions of those closet to them, and Donna Jo Napoli lays bare the original tale remarkably loyally, while delving deeper into the depths of what makes the three protagonists tick: Konrad's helpless obession with Zel, Zel's desire to please her mother yet follow her own path, and (most fascinating and frightening of all) Zel's mother's terror of loosing that which she loved most, and indeed gave up her very soul for. All the questions that you had when you first heard the 'Rapunzel' fairytale are answered: (how did Rapunzel's hair get so long? Why did the witch lock Rapunzel away? What were the witch's real motivations?), and at the same time we get a deeper look at the tale that we do not expect. I was not entirely fond of the fact that the book was written in present tense (ie - \\"she goes to the well\\" instead of \\"she went to the well\\"), but I concede it is necessary to pull one right up close to the characters and the decisions/actions they make.<br />Donna Jo Napoli is a remarkable author, enriching and illuminating this particular fairytale, making each fantasy element seem not quite as impossible as one might think. The glimpses into the nature of love, the abuse of children, the gift of free spirit and the reality of faith are thought-provoking and set off all kinds of discussions. I would also recommend Paul Zelinsky's picture book of \\"Rapunzel\\" as a wonderful accomplice to this book - although his is set in Italy, it too creates a deep and beautiful retelling of \\"Rapunzel\\" that we have not heard before.ed most, and indeed gave up her very soul for.

I would also recommend Paul Zelinsky's picture book of \\"Rapunzel\\" as a wonderful accomplice to this book - although his is set in Italy, it too creates a deep and beautiful retelling of \\"Rapunzel\\" that we have not heard before.	2003-05-27

Convincing Claudia to bring her brother and sisters to the house, the vixen soon inlists all three of them to help her in her quest.<br />She explains that the house is called Fell Andred - the House of Mirrors, and that it serves as a gateway between this world, known as the Stillworld, and the Wildworld. Each mirror within the house leads to the Wildworld, and it is through these mirrors that Morgana's kidnapper, the twisted and evil sorcerer Cadal Forge, plans to journey through on the Night of the Solstice to exact revenge on the world that once betrayed him.<br />But when the vixen diappears, the children are left on their own, with only two weeks before the Solstice, to master the mirrors, rescue Morgana and prevent Cadal Forge and his sorcerei from entering their world.<br />Its seems a magical premise, but often L. J. Smith's writing style falls short of the narrative. She is best at human nature: relationships between people, responses to the supernatural, the meeting of challenges - all this she handles with ease. However, in the context of the fantasy world she presents exposition of how the Wildworld runs in large, confusing chunks, (usually through someone talking or reminising) instead of a gradual unwinding of figures and facts, and often dwindles on the wrong situations - rather than conveying the potentially fascinating history and information of her world in an interesting manner, she gives us Janie overhearing a catty conversion between two school friends that really lends nothing to the story. This is unfortunatly a constant trend in the novel: skipping over what could be the most interesting scenes and giving them to us in hindsight (such as Charles luring Elwyn, the creation of the Heart of Valor, and the trio of children [minus Janie] being confronted by the sorcerei).<br />The pacing is exhausting - the conflicts and problems flit by in rapid succession, jumping from scene to scene with no respite in between from one crisis to the next. Some may consider constantly moving action a good thing (one is never in need of excitement during the course of the story), but sometimes the pacing needs a little rest: it is in restful moments were we get to know the characters a little better, and let them reflect on their thoughts and circumstances.<br />Solutions to problems often fall into the children's heads out of nowhere, or at least from very unlikely drawn conclusions: (Claudia for example identifies an imposter by the size of her feet as compared to barely-glimpsed footprints in the dust, and Charles sudden awareness of how to combat the Groundsler by its scantily-revealed clues seems out of the blue) and for the most part the narrative goes nowhere - the children travel through the mirror, triumph over a certain obstacle and then return, often with little or no progress in their overall quest.<br />However, despite my critism, young fantasy fans *will* enjoy this: it's exciting, suspenceful and inventive, and L. J. Smith paints vivid pictures of family relations and child perceptions. The comparisons between our sunlit world and the shadowy, night-time Wildworld is delightful, with Morgana's house as a clever gateway between the two.

Or at least Buffy Summers, the Vampire Slayer, is trying to settle into college - after three disasterous years at Sunnydale High, she's determined to juggle her responsibilities as the Slayer and the daily life of Buffy Summers perfectly. But raising such standards upon herself can only end in tears as her stress level rises what with angry lecturers, late assignments, nightly vampire patrols and added tension between herself and best friend Willow Rosenburg.<br />But things really begin to get complicated when two new forces present themselves: a highly organised group of vampires that seem to suck not just blood, but energy from their prey, and the spirit of a past Slayer - the legendary Lucy Hanover, a Slayer of the 1800's. From Lucy comes a message from an otherworldly Prophet: that a great evil is one its way due to a mistake that Buffy herself has made; and from the bat-tattooed vampires comes a link to the Mayan bat-god Camazotz.<br />But things go from bad to worse when a stake-out at the habormaster's office turns sour, and the gang summon the Prophet to gain more information. But with this action, Buffy is catapulted forward in time, from a nineteen year old to a twenty-five year old, in an entirely new world from what she has ever known...<br />And there is ends. As one might expect, it finishes right when it begins to get exciting, and the frustration begins when you realise you're going to have to track down three more books in order to finish the story. For this reason, I strongly suggest getting hold of the four-book set published in one volumne to eliminate this problem. By itself, \\"Prophesies\\" is a promising, but rather slow start. Though the main components of the new sect of vampires, the spirit visits and the comparison between Buffy-the-Slayer and Buffy-the-Person are interesting, the continual fight and research scenes between them are a little sluggish. The \\"fight\\" between Buffy and Willow seems rather forced, but I enjoyed the role of Lucy Hanover - a character never seen in the television series, but who appears regularly in novelisations: (see \\"The Gatehouse Keeper trilogy\\" and \\"Immortal\\") The Slayer past that she represents is fascinating, as well as virtually unknown - because of this it is one of the open avenues that writers can explore more freely in the books.<br />The problems with novelisations based on existing material is that the author can't really extend the situations and the characters at the risk of contradicting past or future episodes on T.V. For that reason all the Buffy books seem to exist in a static world all of their own - you know before you start reading that none of the main characters are going to perish, and that the author has to get the all situations back to how it started in order to remain within the context of the T.V. series.<br />But all in all, it is a quick, entertaining read. All the characters are true to their portrayal in the television series, and readers will always enjoy the cute little references to things like Amy the rat and Olivia's plane-visits. Though it takes a while getting there, it sets up an interesting enough premise to make you head for the next installment: \\"Dark Times\\".e interesting, the continual fight and research scenes between them are a little sluggish.

This friend Molly Bover is kind enough, but Strang itself immediatly has a negative effect on all three of the children. It is clammy, uncomfortable and gloomy, and Prill in particular is disturbed by the yearly village play which features the skull of an old horse being waved about on a stick. Oliver meanwhile, learns from several old sources that there is supposedly a curse on the village, set upon it by an old beggar who was turned away from the gate and flooded the old village that legend tells now lies at the bottom of Blake's Pit. Lastly, Colin discovers the horrible Edge family that seems to dominate the entire place, who boast lineage from this old beggar and seem to bring accidents and chaos where-ever they go.<br />Ann Cheetham's writing gifts are two-fold. First of all, her love of history and folklore shines through in her writing - in her book she mentions the true customs of the Mumming play, a pagan rite to ensure the theme of death and rebirth, the eating of 'Soul Cakes' in which the living essentially eat the spirits of the dead, the use of 'Old Hob', the macabre hobby-horse made from the skull of a dead horse, and the many legends in Britian of the cursed village at the bottom of lakes that appear whenever trouble lies ahead. In testimony to these, she quotes 'The Ballad of Semerwater' by Willian Watson as her prolouge, and has an afterword in which she explains the traditions and beliefs of all the above strange customs.<br />Her second technique is both her trademark and her downfall. She is wonderful at creating spooky and otherworldly events, but in order to keep the atmosphere of strange occurances happening just beyond the limits of human understanding she is forced to keep the reader firmly on the outside looking in. This succeeds in making the horrible events within Strang creepy, but fails in the respect that often the reader has no idea what's going on. I've read the book twice now, and though I am always struck by the disappearence of Posie Massey, the boiling of William's head, the poodle locked in the heated kiln, and especially Prill and Colin's nightmares, which are marvellously created by Cheatham's use of words, I'm equally frustrated by what she *doesn't* tell us. By the end of the book, I'm never sure what truly happened in Strang, nor how Oliver managed to expell the beggar's curse - it all remains locked in the young boy's head. Yet perhaps this is what Cheatham was going for, as she says in her last sentence that nobody else had any real idea of what had truly happened in those few weeks.<br />So it is a difficult read, but one that you might find rewarding. Its elusive themes and nightmarish visions cannot help but chill your spine, and all threads are brought together in a web that human perception can only barely see - it seems to be part of a bigger picture that only a special few (like Oliver) can understand.

Where are the princesses going and how are they getting out? Many men are sent to guard the princesses with the promise that if they solve the mystery they may gain one of their hands in marriage, but all the young princes disappear by morning. But one day Michael comes to the castle as a helper to the gardener with the magical gift of an invisibility cloak given to him by an old woman on the road. Instantly smitten with the youngest princess Lina, Michael hides in the girls' bedroom under his cloak and watches them creep through a secret trapdoor, through glittering woods and across a vast lake to a castle... but how is a mere commoner supposed to inform the king of this and secure the love of his youngest daughter?<br />Ruth Sanderson once again brings to life a beautiful fairytale with her glorious oil paintings, making this a must for any bookshelf, or lovers of fairytales or fine art. Despite the fact there are twelve princesses, the illustrations are never cluttered, and Sanderson captures water, material, hair and even glances between one figure to another realistically, yet with a whimsical and fantasy touch. If there is one slight flaw, her colours are less bright than in other books - they are mostly pale yellows, blues or greens that give them a slightly washed out look when compared to the vividness of her other books such as 'The Golden Mare, the Firebird and the Magic Ring' and 'The Crystal Mountain', but this is most definitely one of her best narrative retellings. 'The Enchanted Wood' in my opinion still contains her best illustrations, but the story is rather weak. 'The Twelve Dancing Princesses' is the best choice for a melding of both art and storytelling skills.<br />Basically, girls will adore this, parents will love reading it, and if you take the time to persuade boys that is isn't a 'girly' book, then I'm certain they'll be intrigued enough by the mysterious midnight travels through the woods and the cunning of Michael to enjoy it too!ations, but the story is rather weak.

It's hard to imagine a kid who wouldn't enjoy these books, and the interesting stories and bright illustrations are something even the adults will enjoy!<br />'Search for the Sunken City' is the nautical adventure of Professor Ollie, the famous marine archeologist and his nephew and niece Toby and Flic. He is on the verge of a great discovery - the wreck of an old galleon that he believed was the ship of the great explorer San Miguel Da Silva. The kids join their uncle, but events are already on the move - someone has stolen a parchment from the artefacts already lifted from the wreck, and the pages left behind reveal it is a diary revealing the location of the mythical city Mare Vellos.

This book (and all of the others in this series) promotes problem-solving and lateral thinking, combined within a story that is suitably atmospheric and spooky.<br />Jay and Ben are staying with their Aunt Hetty in the village of Little Snoozing, a place little more than a hamlet, but surrounded by all that a mystery-lover would expect: solitary standing stones, misty moors, deserted manor houses and ruined castles - just describing it makes me want to go and read it! When the two go exploring one day, they find themselves hopelessly lost in the mist, but stumble down into a strangely old-fashioned village that is not marked on their map. Finding a cozy inn and feeling welcomed by the innkeeper and his boy Thomas, the two decide to stay the night - but the following day they awake to find themselves asleep on the ground of the moor.<br />Their story quickly travels about Little Snoozing, and Ben and Jay are drawn into a mystery surrounding their vanishing village - there *was* once a village in the valley, but why has it disappeared? Why can't anyone get back in? And how can the two release it from its 'time-slip' imprisonment?<br />The illustrations by Brenda Haw should entice both kids and adults - she uses bright, cheerful colours for Little Snoozing, dark, dismal browns and greys for Creville Manor, and indigos and purples to wonderfully capture the other-worldliness of the vanishing village. Even the standing stones in the bright light of day seem strange and mysterious.<br />All in all, I would recommend this for those who have to be coaxed into a love of books - the simple yet spooky story, the great cartoonish illustrations and the interactive nature of the puzzles make this a great treat. Parents and kids can easily work through it together, with a pen and paper to work out the clues, and hopefully it will become to you what it is for me - an old favourite.a love of books - the simple yet spooky story, the great cartoonish illustrations and the interactive nature of the puzzles make this a great treat.

However, if you're like me and are a big fan of Ruth Sanderson's illustrations, it doesn't take much to easily see that this is simply *not* her best work. Newcomers to Sanderson will see only colourful, elaborate paintings; fans will see the wide, obvious brushstrokes that she usually manages to conceal, the hasty composition of the paintings, and the frequent distortions of character's faces (many times Cinderella's nose shape changes from rounded to pointy, and her features often appear rather squished). The detail is also not as refined as in her other books, and within the context of the story Cinderella wears two dresses - one is written as being gold, but appears a rather ugly brown-yellow colour, and the other (that you can see on the title page) is so elabourate and wide it looks a bit garish.<br />But as I said before, a person will only notice these faults if they are experienced with Sanderson's work, and know that she has done a lot better in the past. For me, it feels as if she needed a quick paycheck, and so hurriedly slapped this book together. However, if this is your first Sanderson book, then your're in luck, because everything from this one is a step up!<br />In terms of the narrative, there are a few variations on the story, but overall it's your traditional tale. Like she did in her books 'The Crystal Mountain' and 'The Golden Mare, the Firebird and the Magic Ring', Sanderson mixes up two stories to make one (or in this case two *versions* of the same story) taking elements on the classic French version by Charles Perrault and the Brothers Grimm. This creates a fresh twist on the most well-known of tales - here Cinderella's father doesn't die, but is in fact held firmly under the reign of his new wife, and only comes to his daughter's defence at the end of the book. It also tells of Cinderella's planting of a hazel twig which grows within minutes to a tree and has a white bird land upon it (which is subtly implied to be her mother's spirit). This white bird (also seen on the title page, landing on Cinderella's hand) helps her with her chores, as do all the other birds of the garden, and at the conclusion attacks the stepmother and her daughters, never letting them exit the house (a little odd since Cinderella had just forgiven them all).<br />All in all, a good enough book, but I would recommend for parents searching for a 'Cinderella' tale for their children to choose instead the version by K. Y. Craft, which has much more detailed paintings. For a real look at Sanderson's skill with a paintbrush, I'd suggest 'The Enchanted Woods', which in my opinion is her best work.f Cinderella's planting of a hazel twig which grows within minutes to a tree and has a white bird land upon it (which is subtly implied to be her mother's spirit).

Why, oh why is it that such wonderful books are so often void of any reviews when they should be praised for the skies for their beauty, power and strength? 'Never Let Go' is one of the most heart-rending, beautiful stories there are, and I can say without exaggeration or embarrassment (well, maybe a little embarrassment) that when I opened it at the bookshop and began flicking through it I found that tears were welling up in my eyes.<br />This tale is the age-old story of Tamlin and his bride-to-be Janet, who is a rather plain girl when compared to the handsome Tamlin, who is the toast of every young lady's eye. But when he is kidnapped by the Queen of the Fairies on Midsummer Eve and made a part of her train, then there is nothing left to do but for Janet to go in search of him, through all kinds of danger upon the advice of the double stemmed rose - two roses on one stem.<br />Finally she reaches the crossroads on Halloween Night, and on the Witching Hour the Fairy-Queen's passage begins, carrying behind her all the young men she has captured. Janet grabs the cloak of Tamlin as he passes and holds on tight - &quot;Tamlin, I have you, and I will never let go!&quot;<br />The Queen mocks her for her efforts, and is determined never to allow her most handsome consort return to the human world, and with her magics changes Tamlin from lizard to snake, from bear to lion, from horse to wolf... But Janet only holds on tighter and cries: &quot;You may change, but I am true. You are my Tamlin, and I will never let you go!&quot;<br />As all through the night Janet holds fast to her love, finally the Queen turns to her most cruellest test: Tamlin becomes a bar of iron that sings with heat. But to this Janet only says: &quot;You may burn hot, but my love burns hotter, and I will *never* let you go&quot;...<br />If you're anything like me, you're already sobbing. This is quite simply one of the most beautiful stories I've ever read, and Geraldine McCaughrean brings new wonders to an ancient story with her imaginative writing, vividly creating the horrors and torments that Janet must suffer, the dark mysteriousness of Fairyland where the rivers run red with the blood of mankind's wars, and the final outcome and resolution of the story.<br />Much credit must also go to the fantastic illustrations of Jason Cockcroft and his unique, almost mosaic-like paintwork that creates fluid and realistic figures made up of thousands of tiny, multicoloured dots. His faces are exquisite - all the shades of pain, fear, sadness and unshakeable love upon Janet's features are gloriously realised. And the very last small circular painting...well I'm just going to make you track down this book if you want to know what it is and why it creates those darn tears.<br />What more can I say? 'Never Let Go' is a lost triumph, that says in fewer words, but with far more sincerity, that love conquers all.s to an ancient story with her imaginative writing, vividly creating the horrors and torments that Janet must suffer, the dark mysteriousness of Fairyland where the rivers run red with the blood of mankind's wars, and the final outcome and resolution of the story.<BR>Much credit must also go to the fantastic illustrations of Jason Cockcroft and his unique, almost mosaic-like paintwork that creates fluid and realistic figures made up of thousands of tiny, multicoloured dots.

US	39424751	R32YKT2T85LZHU	0688145973	735937695	Enchantment in the Garden	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Ignore the Editorial Reviews!	Okay, okay, to a point I agree with the above editorial reviews that rather unkindly ground this book into the dirt, as Shirley Hughes's 'Enchantment in the Garden' *is* a little clumsy. Most fans of her work are used to her famous 'Alfie and Annie Rose' books, where the small delights of childhood are emplified through her warm, inviting paintings. Therefore some people might be disconcerted that her trademark chubby, rosy-cheeked toddlers are replaced by two young people on the verge of adolesence, with touches of a premature romance between them. However, that should not stop the true beauty or fairytale lover, and if given half a chance, I believe this poignant tale has all the makings of a beloved classic.<br />Valerie is a young girl who is drastically lonely - she has no friends, her father (who we never see in the book and is only mentioned once) works in the hotel business, and her mother is a 'beautiful American... who breakfasted late, then drove out to meet her friends'. Therefore, on one of her regular walks through the park with her governess, she declares her love and friendship to her favourite stone statue - a youth riding a dolphin - and names him Cherubino. The following day, the statue is gone, leaving only the stone dolphin, but on running away through the hedge garden, Valerie finds none other than a flesh-and-blood Cherubino before her!<br />After she rescues him from the dark, stale orphanage, Cherubino takes up residence in the gardener's home, where the two children meet by night to discuss all manner of things. Here is when Cherubino reveals he is the son of a sea god, who had been a stone statue for many hundreds of years (unfortunatly, we never learn how this occured or why) before being freed by Valerie. Accompaning Valerie and her family on a visit to the seaside Cherubino is angered by the use of the beach - hotels and villas and automobiles and runs away.<br />Valerie despairs of ever seeing him again, till by night he returns once more, explaining to her he is going to return to his homeland, making it green and fertile once more, but leaving her with some beautiful parting words: \\"Sea gods can love humans sometimes, you know...And when we do, we have very long memories.\\" With the promise of one day being together once more, Valerie finds the stone dolphin (now desposited in the untended gardens of the park) and together, they await Cherubino's return.<br />As you can see, the story is not filled with climaxes and surprises - I did not mean to write out the entire summary in this review, but found I had to because there are no dramatic points to leave the reader hanging with. It is mellow, calm and meandering - a book to be read on a lazy summer day, not as a bed time story. In some way, it is like a fine wine - it grows richer each time you read it, resonancing deeper each time - I myself get more moved at Cherubino's parting with Valerie and his promise for the future. This is the positive way of looking at the story - some may feel frustrated at its pace, the not-quite-realised relationship between between the two children (Hughes leaves their bond mostly unspoken) and I know I did get a little tired of the continual pattern of Cherubino running away or getting taken away - it happens four times!<br />However, I severely disagree with the editorial reviews that claim Shirley Hughes's illustrations don't match the story - I think they do beautifully. She has spent summers painting in Italy, and everything from her gardens to her beaches, her estates to her oceans, by day or by night evoke all kinds of feelings and atmospheres. I especially love her formal-yet-somehow-wild gardens and the Greek statues whose eyes seem to watch Valerie where-ever she goes, and her vast, moody oceans in which humans seem hopelessly insignificent by comparison.<br />Basically, the verdict is this: if you read this book critically, it will disappoint, but if you take the wiser approach and read it without bias orstrictness - simply letting yourself drift through the words and pictures - you and your kids will love it.r strictness - simply letting yourself drift through the words and pictures - you and your kids will love it.	2003-03-15

This is a children's picture book confusingly by the same name - an original fairytale by author and illustrator Ruth Sanderson, also know for her works 'The Crystal Mountain', 'Cinderella' and 'The Golden Mare, the Firebird and the Magic Ring'.<br />That said, this book is an interesting mix of truly beautiful paintings (its a pity there isn't a picture of the cover on this webpage, as that always puts people off buying products) and a traditional, predicable story.<br />After a beautiful kingdom becomes plauged by a drought the king sends his three sons Edmund, Owen and Galen to find the Heart of the World that lies within the Enchanted Wood to restore the kingdom - in finding it their purpose will be magically achieved. Successively the three head off, and individually come to a cottage on the verge of the forest, where an old woman warns them not to wander off the path no matter what. Well, you don't really need to be told any more to know exactly what happens. The two older sons succumb to temptation, while the youngest remains true to his quest and succeeds, inheriting the kingdom and marrying the old woman's beautiful daughter Rose who accompanied him through the forest (for both mother and daughter had been unwilling gatekeepers of the forest, though eventually liberated by Galen's nobility). It is an old formula, encompassing all the cliches of a beautiful maiden, the threefold trial, the cursed kingdom, the virtueous youngest brother... Even though children will certainly not be bothered by this, seasoned fairytale lovers will know the tune oh-so-well and be frustrated at its predictability. Thus the title 'original fairytale' is somewhat misused.<br />On the other end of the scale however, some points of the story are quite confusing. It is unclear why finding the Heart of the World restores the land to its former glory, nor how it actually manages to achieve this. Furthermore, though Edmund and Owen's submissions to temptation (respectively to hunt a white stag and engage in battle with a Black Knight) are indeed vices, we are never really certain whether Galen did the right thing in turning his back on his own brothers when witnessing them in peril. Lastly, the meaning of the silver key that Rose drops into the Heart's waters and the 'ceremony' that she performs is unclear in its meaning and point.<br />However, *please* don't let my grousing over this feature stop you from finding this book as they pale in comparison to Sanderson's exquisite oil paintings, and are in fact (in my opinion) her best. In no other book of hers has she reached the level of detail and realism that she does in 'The Enchanted Wood'. She captures motion perfectly, her animals (deer and horses) are beautiful, and all little girls be satisfied that the heroine Rose is stunning. The best part however is Sanderson's illustrations of the forest - their misty, mysterious, shrouded depths are gorgeously created, from their forbidding entrance at the iron gates to the Heart of the World - three treetrunks intertwinging to make one.<br />The illustrations more than make up for the story and make this book a must-have for all lovers of great art, children's books, fairytales or beauty in general.<br />It is unfortunate that it has such a well-used title, as I know of two other books by the same name (Enid Blyton's, and another 'Enchanted Wood' by the Australian writer and illustrator Shirley Barber) but the illustrations *are* worth the effort to tracks this book down, either from Amazon or your library.the land to its former glory, nor how it actually manages to achieve this.

US	39424751	R21MAFS8G5NJFP	0064404455	547529228	Tom's Midnight Garden	Books	5	12	13	N	N	A True Children's Classic	'Tom's Midnight Garden' is Phillipa Pearce's award-winning novel, as well as her best work - all her other writings are measured by this, and so far none have quite reached its peak. It is a time-slip story, which means I was somewhat cross-eyed by the end of it (I usually avoid time-travelling adventures like the plauge on account of the 'confusing ordering' of them all), but Pearce keeps to all the laws of physics that would apply if one actually *could* time-travel. The real beauty of the story is not the time-travelling at all, but the realism of all the characters, the profound themes concerning the passage of time and growing up, the simple but true friendship between Tom and Hatty, and the idea of a secret garden, not separated from the rest of the world by a mere wall like in [...], but by Space and Time themselves.<br />Tom Long is being sent from his home and the promise of a long, lazy summer to his Uncle Alan and Aunt Gwen's dreary, boring flat, as his brother Peter has the measles. Frustrated and rude to begin with, he lives a confined and utterly restricted half-life within their cold and unwelcoming home. In fact, the only thing that proves that time is indeed moving at its normal pace is the ticking of the ancient grandfather clock belonging to old Mrs Bartholemew, the land-lady who lives upstairs. The clock keeps strange time however, often it gives more or less chimes than it's supposed to, and one night Tom is sure that he hears it chime the hour thirteen. Creeping downstairs to investigate, he discovers instead that the backdoor opens out into a beautiful, silent, vast garden. He soon becomes a regular visitor, but only by night, for in the daytime the door instead opens out onto a grimy yard. But in the garden he meets Hatty, a lonely little girl under the tyranny of her unkind aunt and three cousins, and the only being that can actually see him! After the friendship is made, the real adventures start, but threading through all of this is the continual mystery - how did the garden get there? Who is Hatty? Where did she and the garden come from? Are they ghosts or merely images from the past? *Why* is the garden there in the first place?<br />Pearce treats what is essentially her main character - the garden itself - not as a strange, utterly abnormal event, nor as a comfitable, familiar occurance, but as a ghostly, yet steady place. Tom's reactions to it, from his initial awe, to fright, to intoxication with it is vividly and realistically portrayed so that we too honestly share in these emotions.<br />It is fascinating to read of Tom's explorations of the garden and the twofold freedom he experiences - first that he is away from the regulations of his aunt and uncle, and second that of his invisibility to the denizens of the garden. Pearce creates beautiful descriptive passages of the garden and surrounding grounds, but marks them with intriguing sentences such as: 'Tom often had the feeling of people having just gone, and an uncomfortable feeling of someone who had *not* gone; someone who, unobserved, observed him. Pearce builds up the tension and in this story magnificently, as Tom gradually builds up his knowledge of the garden and slowly begins to traverse its borders.<br />Furthermore, Tom's decision to quit the real world to dwell forever within the 'garden-world' is a thought-provoking one, and coupled achingly well with Hatty's growth, movement into 'grown-up' things, and steady forgetting of Tom. The feelings of change and aging reminds me very much of stories concerning Peter Pan and Wendy, however in Barrie's book, where we predominatly see through Wendy's eyes, here we can see how Peter probably felt as an elusive and 'unreal' figure, loosing someone not through death or place but through the simple inevitability of growing up.<br />Thus the story is definitly not just for kids, as the major message of the book is a bittersweet one - that we must all someday leave our childhoods behind for thebigger realm of adulthood beyond our own backgardens. Yet we need never forget those times, nor loose the friendships we forged within them. Certainly Tom and Hatty didn't.igger realm of adulthood beyond our own backgardens.

Reading it was quite a different experience for me, but people who aren't prepared for the style of writing like I was might be disappointed, confused or scorning of the slow, dream-like pace, archetype characters and poetical language. This might be especially true of fans of typical 'fantasy' genre books (authors such as David Eddings or Terry Brooks) where a fantasy universe is deemed to be good only if it has a solid backing and an exhaustive array of facts and figures to add realism to the stories. Lord Dusany however, expects the reader to take for granted the existence of Elfland, trolls, elves and will o' the wisps, without trying to explain them. 'The King of Elfland's Daughter' is refreshingly free of geographies, biologies, cultures, or other infinite details that are so prevailent in other fantasy cult books.<br />The story goes that the Parliament of Erl approaches their king, eager for their small country to be known throughout the lands. The solution is for it to somehow imbue magic into its royalty, and to achieve this the king sends his son Alveric into Elfland to make the King of Elfland's daughter his wife. Alveric is successful in this, and brings the beautiful Lirazel back to Erl, where they have a child Orien. The King of Elfland however desparatly wants his daughter returned to him, and by use of three powerful runes, contrives to bring her back to her home.<br />Dunsany delves into several themes throughout the book, all framed by the contrasts of Erl and Elfland. Within this, he explores the differences between Paganism and Christianity, freedom and restrictions, the passage of times, mortality and immortality, male and female, parent and child - the list goes on. Running through these is the main story thread that makes clear that everyone desires what they cannot have, and although by the end of the novel their desires come to furfillment, it is in an ironic resolution that no one (including this reviewer) could have ever wished for. The ending is thus happy, but contains a certain sense of something bittersweet, like a lost childhood that Dusany continually likens Elfland to.<br />It was acknowledged by many later fantasy writers that they were inspired by Dunsany, including (obviously) Tolkien. It is no coincidence that Alveric and Lirazel have a certain resemblance to Aragorn and Arwen in way of their courtly love and somewhat 'forbidden' romance. However, I feel that Dunsany hits upon notes of inevitable dischord between the two that Tolkien neglects. I wonder for example if Arwen ever felt: 'the years that assail beauty, and the harshness that vex the spirit that were already about her, and the doom of all mortals hung over her head.' It is something for devoted Tolkien fans to think about, as well as potent storytelling. (That wasn't a dig at Tolkien by any means, just a thought to dwell on).<br />On the actual styles of storytelling, many people might feel frustrated at the continued use of 'the fields we know' to describe earth, and faery as a place 'only told of in song'. However, as I went through the story, I found the repetition to become quite familiar and comfiting, like a steady rhythm or heartbeat, and the final sentence making use of this repeated phrase made me take a deep sigh of contentment. Lord Dunsany's other gift is his use of metaphor and imagery. For instance, his use of the priest likening Lirazel to a mermaid, and then later echoing this thought with 'there was something in [the priest's] voice as he spoke, a little distant from her, and [Lirazel] knew that he spoke as one that walked safe upon the shore, calling far to a mermaid in a dangerous sea,' makes this not a book, but literature. Dunsany's soft, poetical, vivid, mellow language is what makes this book so appealing, and used to unforgetable descriptions of Elfland, twilight, the countryside, and beauty in all its forms.<br />A couple of times he faulters when he slips into what I've described above - trying to make story *real*. References to Tennyson and the infamous unicorn horn of Rome are jarring, and pull one out of the dreamy atmosphere. The archetypes are expected and unsurprising - the mighty king of Elfland, the elusive witch-upon-the-hill, the elfin beauty, the warrior-king, the hunter-prince, the trickster fey - we've encounted them countless times in one form or another.<br />But overall, this book has my recommendation, for a novelty to see how the fantasy-writers wrote before Tolkien, and for a wonderful escape into a glorious world. Plus, you can learn some little bits of trivia that you may of not known before, for instance - did you know that faeries hate dogs? That they cause clocks to stop? That their infants can talk?light, the countryside, and beauty in all its forms.<br />A couple of times he faulters when he slips into what I've described above - trying to make story *real*.

US	39424751	RY8MIAYIPT4SH	0789425556	633777082	The Lion And The Unicorn	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Poignant and Heartbreaking	Shirley Hughes is best known for her famous 'Alfie' books in which she takes ordinary urban life, and through her warm prose and beautiful illustrations, changes it into something magical. In 'The Lion and the Unicorn' she goes in a slightly different direction, making a slightly older boy her protagonist, setting it against a backdrop of World War Two, and having her narrative flow along to heighten all of Lenny's experiences of fear and anxiety in the war rather than pinpoint one particular event or circumstance. Although the book is not specific about how much time it emcompasses, one could easily imagine that it takes place over several years.<br />Lenny is a young boy living in war-time London, where the nights are regularly filled with the sounds of bombs and airplanes. His father is already at the war, sending him letters filled with pictures (one in particular has a pencil-drawn unicorn) and leaving him as the keeper of a medallion with a fighting lion and unicorn upon it. When a home nearby is destroyed, Lenny's mother takes him to the train station to be evacuted, leading to a confused and heartbreaking separation. Lenny is taken to a large old house in the country (and Hughes's illustrations magnifiently capture its grandeur and beauty by day and its gloominess and vastness by night) where he is faced with sleeping by himself in a strange room, being bullied by children at school because of his bedwetting, and his refusal to eat bacon/pork as served by the head maid.<br />From here things move both up and down. His bed wetting (with help from a kindly young maid) improves, only to get worse when letters from his mother stop coming. The taunts at school intensify, and the other girls at the house are malicious. Only one thing seems to give him any comfit - the discovery of a walled garden (and here Hughes's love of the Secret Garden [she has illustrated an edition], shines through) with the graceful statue of a unicorn inside. There he also meets a strange and quiet one-legged man who speaks to him about the deeper meanings of courage, and how one is able to grasp it.<br />The two images of the lion and the unicorn are prevailent throughout the book, in a way they symbolise the battle between fear and bravery, but also the two *types* of bravery: the lion as the raging courage soldiers must have as they go into battle, the unicorn as the more passive, quiet courage that Lenny is desparately trying to achieve.<br />Shirley Hughes once more delievers a beautiful and poignant book (though many may not be used to anything but her Alfie collection) that captures the intensity and real fear that children possess, and the difficult circumstances in which courage was won. Younger children may be a little confused at the winding pace and style of the story (they expect a clear-cut beginning, middle and ending resolution), but Hughes's illustrations successfully bring the life and times of the second World War to today, nostalgically and relevently.and quiet one-legged man who speaks to him about the deeper meanings of courage, and how one is able to grasp it. <br />The two images of the lion and the unicorn are prevailent throughout the book, in a way they symbolise the battle between fear and bravery, but also the two *types* of bravery: the lion as the raging courage soldiers must have as they go into battle, the unicorn as the more passive, quiet courage that Lenny is desparately trying to achieve.<br />Shirley Hughes once more delievers a beautiful and poignant book (though many may not be used to anything but her Alfie collection) that captures the intensity and real fear that children possess, and the difficult circumstances in which courage was won.

She takes him to the home of a farmer and his wife to watch over their new-born daughter Carrie, but little does anyone know how great this tiny cat will soon become.<br />Carrie and Catkin are inseparable until one day Catkin is distracted by a butterfly and leaves the baby to her sleep, and in his absence the child is taken away by the Lord and Lady of the Little People and their followers, leaving a changeling in her place. The farmer and his wife are devastated, and the Wise Woman sends Catkin to the underground world of the Little People to win the child back, giving him some valuable advice - never reveal his name to the fairies, for with the knowledge of his name they could bind him to them forever.<br />The real beauty of this exceptional story is twofold: first, that although it reads like a traditional fairytale, it is completely original. Yet despite this, it turns to real folktale elements and styles to blend into the narrative, making it vaugely familiar - ideas such as the hollow hills of the fairies, the changeling baby, the power of a simple name, the threefold riddle competition, and the nature of the waters of the two powerful trees - the willow for forgetfulness, and the hazel for wisdom. Added to this is the perfect melding of all these components, for instance the Wise Woman advices Catkin to drink only from the hazel tree waters to obtain great wisdom, whilst Carrie has already drunk from the willow waters and forgotten her home. These two elements are echoed as the answers to the the first two riddles that the Lord asks of Catkin, and Catkin's own name as the answer to the third, tying in the warning that the kitten must never utter his own name. I'm explaining this very clumsily, but my point is that all themes and story lines come full circle, creating a perfect whole. It is simply beautifully crafted storytelling.<br />The second part that makes this story so wonderful is P. J. Lynch's exceptional watercolours. If you are a fan of Alan Lee (best known for his Tolkien illustrations) than nothing will delight more than Lynch's images of green hill and dark cave, the sun-lit visions of Carrie and Catkin, and the green tinted shades of the Lord and Lady of the Little People. Only two small quibbles come to mind - when the faerys first appear the text describes the Lord as riding on a pony, but the picture shows him walking hand in hand with the Lady, and in one scene baby Carrie's head looks far too big for her body. But don't take any notice of these, for the painting and skill are exceptional - make sure you look out for this artist's other books.<br />My highest recommendation - all ages and both genders will adore this story and its ideals of courage, sacrifice and love. The pictures delight, and the echoes of it stay with you for a very long time.ed storytelling.<br />The second part that makes this story so wonderful is P. J. Lynch's exceptional watercolours.

US	39424751	R2HSL2T5XN3OWA	0590972189	721605233	Book of Enchantments (Point Fantasy)	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Truly a book of enchantment	As one who has never been a big fan of short stories, as well as one that has never read a Patricia Wrede book before in her life, it was some wonder when I found myself picking up this book at the library and reading the blurb, that promised \\"a black sword of cruel potency, a plumed serpent drawn from stone, a harp made of bone that sings of murder...\\" I was hooked.<br />Each story is clearly and precisely written, and range from comedy to tragedy, from happily-ever-after fairytales to somewhat fractured traditional tales, and each one is a gem. Usually in anthologies there are a few clunkers, but here each one is original, witty and beautifully written. Whether you are a fan of Patricia Wrede's 'Enchanted Forest' books or not, this collection will delight any age group, and is essential to any fairytale lover. Many stories are excellent for reading aloud, and just as many are perfect for curling up under the covers with a torch late at night. This book has my highest recommendation.<br />To describe each and every story would have me exceeding the word limit on this review, so here are summaries of a few of my favourites, in no particular order-<br />'The Princess, the Cat and the Unicorn' has all the trademarks of what I quickly became familiar with as Wrede's technique for twisting traditional fairytale stereotypes on their head. Princess Elyssa is the middle sister of three, but she isn't jealous of them, her stepmother isn't trying to kill her, and she is perfectly able to out on adventures of her own. The unicorn in this tale is a welcome relief (as well as a parady) to the myraid of stories out there with gushy, sickly-sweet unicorns out there.<br />'Earthwitch' is the darker tale of divided lovers who come together once more - the earthwitch Mariel and the lord Evan Rydingsword who comes to her for help against the troops devastating his land. The tension between them rises, but she agrees to help, calling on the earth itself for power. But the costs of such power is a great one, as the two will soon find out.<br />'The Lorelei' is the German version of the Greek Sirens and said to haunt the Rhine River, luring people to their deaths with her beautiful voice. When Janet and a busload of her mostly unpleasant classmates visit the river they are forced to stay there when their bus breaks down. All seems quiet, but then Janet notices: there seems to be a boy missing...<br />'Stronger than time' is a strange and beautiful story of lost love, and what would of happened if the prince had never come to awaken Sleeping Beauty. The elderly woodsman Arven, still pining over the death of his wife, is surprised one day by the arrival of a young stranger, desparate to get into the abandoned castle before morning. Fill of beautiful language and poignant storytelling, this one's one of my favourites.<br />'The Cruel Sisters' is my favourite overall, strange since it isn't actually a happy ending. Based on an old ballad, this story is lyrical, bittersweet, macabre, and beautifully told. With elements of tragedy, betrayal, mystery and horror, it includes a false lover, a harp of bone, a dress in a thorn bush... this one kept me thinking for a long time.<br />Finally, 'Utensile Strength' is probably what will attract most fans to this anthology as it is set once more in Wrede's 'Enchanted Wood' theme, with all the familiar characters, including Mendanbar, Cimorene and Daystar, dealing with the formidable problem of: the Frying Pan of Doom.<br />All in all, a great, varied collection - but make sure you read the authors notes at the end, as they feature all her inspiration and resources, whether they be from old ballets or Biblical stories - it's quite interesting. And of course, the famous recipe for the Quick After-Battle Triple Chocolate Cake!power is a great one, as the two will soon find out.<br />'The Lorelei' is the German version of the Greek Sirens and said to haunt the Rhine River, luring people to their deaths with her beautiful voice.

The Eagles of Roman Legions were of uptmost importance to the soldiers within them, as the eagle symbolised their strength, their union and Rome itself. In the wrong hands it could spell disgrace or loss of moral should it ever be marched against Rome. For this reason Romans went to great lengths to protect the Eagle, even at the cost of their lives, and often an 'eagle-bearer' would march with the troops in order to protect and care for the precious token.<br />\\"The hunting ground is a wide one, and who knows into what strange covers the hunt may led us.\\"<br />So says Centurion Marcus Flavius Aquila and his freed slave Esca at the start of their journey. Marcus's father was the leader of the Ninth Legion, and Marcus takes up the chance to find out exactly what did happen to him and the lost Ninth Legion that he had led, by crossing the safety of the Hadrian Wall and following the rumours of a Celtic tribe said to hold a strange Roman artefact of war. Wounded in battle and so stripped of his dream to become a First Cohort like his father, Marcus applies himself fully to restoring the honour of his father's Legion and prevent the Eagle from becoming a weapon of propaganda.<br />The two cross into dangerous territory, first disguised as a medicene man and his spear-bearer, and then as fugitives as they hurry back towards the Wall. Although the long first chapters that relay Marcus's first command and leg injury are rather long and probably unnessarsary (the quest doesn't actually begins until chapter eleven), those that hang in there will be rewarded with a nail-biting theft of the Eagle and a riveting final chase to safety.<br />Sutcliff creates a sympathetic character in Marcus, readers of this day and age will nod in approval at his treatment of his 'slave' Esca, but he has a touch of arrogance that will make scholars of Roman History smile. Backing up this protagonist is the fascinating character of Esca, who is often identified with the wild wolf that Marcus raises as a tame animal, Marcus's jovial uncle Aquila, and the frustrated 'girl-next-door' Cottia. All are interesting and genuine people, and all their relationships are handled well - there is no sappy romance, easy friendships or mushy uncle/nephew bond here; it is, to put it simply: real.<br />Like all her books, Sutcliff's writing is infused with potent imagery (the olive wood bird, the Celtic shield and 'Roman' dagger, and the Eagle itself) and poetic language that is blissful to read. Sutcliff had a gift in provoking images of landscape and imagery, and again she never distances the reader from the characters even when teaching them something about history - I was especially interested by the Feast of Spears in chapter fourteen. She juggles melancoly and despair perfectly with hope and renewal, and anyone who does make it through those first few chapters (which unfortunatly really do bring the rating down) might find themselves enjoying this unique story.ssarsary (the quest doesn't actually begins until chapter eleven), those that hang in there will be rewarded with a nail-biting theft of the Eagle and a riveting final chase to safety.<br />Sutcliff creates a sympathetic character in Marcus, readers of this day and age will nod in approval at his treatment of his 'slave' Esca, but he has a touch of arrogance that will make scholars of Roman History smile.

US	39424751	R10XRNZ402EQBX	0786807083	646904924	Night Shade (Daughters of the Moon)	Books	1	14	20	N	N	Not Recommended	I'll put it bluntly: I don't recommend this series. Granted, I'm no longer in the demographic that \\"Daughters of the Moon\\" is targeted toward, but I was when I first read \\"Nightshade\\" and I wasn't impressed even then.<br /><br />The premise of Daughters of the Moon is that young girls who are delivered by the goddess Diana are infused with magical powers that they must use against the ancient evil Atrox and his various minions. It's the girl-power meets evil-bashing type of book, a ploy that usually works, but to be honest - there's better stuff out there that cover the same ground.<br /><br />The \\"goddesses\\" themselves are typical stereotypes: Serena is the leader, Jimena is the bad girl, Catty is the shy one, and Vanessa is the...extra? Each book is written from a particular girl's point of view, and in this case the protagonist Jimena is awfully dense. When her boyfriend Veto turns up, she never once questions the fact that he's back from the dead and suspicions as to any possible misdeeds aren't even considered, even when he breaks into her apartment in the middle of the night.<br /><br />Most characterization seems to be based on clothing. In fact, a LOT of the exposition of the book is based on clothing. So, here goes:<br /><br />Minions of Evil will be modeling \\"a stretchy black capris with a low-cut black tank top and too much silver jewelry\\" or \\"a skimpy black dress and shiny black boots.\\"<br /><br />I guess you can tell they're evil because they have no fashion sense.<br /><br />Forces of Good however, go for the brighter look, such as: \\"red cowboy boots and a lacy sundress,\\" or \\"a pink slip dress and beaded slides\\" or \\"a split tube top that showed off the piercing in her belly button and a pink hip-hugging skirt with an asymmetrical hem.\\"<br /><br />Actually never mind, the good guys don't seem to have much fashion sense either.<br /><br />No one ever said these books were high-class literature, but some of these quotes reveal the level of style at work:<br /><br />\\"She yearned for the sweet kind of love she had known with him.\\"<br /><br />\\"He reminded her of a lizard, the way his beady eyes darted up and down her body with frank sexual interest.\\"<br /><br />\\"If this is true, it is very bad for us because it means that she has come up with an evil plan.\\"<br /><br />Just...no.him.\\"    \\"He reminded her of a lizard, the way his beady eyes darted up and down her body with frank sexual interest.\\"    \\"If this is true, it is very bad for us because it means that she has come up with an evil plan.\\"    Just...no.	2003-01-25
US	39424751	R18ONM3DWVDPPA	067155137X	992503620	The Chosen (Night World)	Books	4	9	12	N	N	One of the Better Ones	As the fifth book in the Night World series, 'The Chosen' improves on all four of the previous books, drawing on deeper themes and ideas than the rest, and setting the scene for this continuing trend in the next book 'Soulmate'.<br />Rashel Jordan is only five years old when she witnesses her mother being killed and her younger brother Timmy being drunken from by a vampire. Because she's seen the killer and is telling others about what happened he comes after her when she stays at her Aunt Corinne's house, burning it to the ground. Rashel is alone in the world.<br />At seventeen years old, she is the bane of vampire-kind. Calling herself 'the Cat' she hunts and kills their kind in all of the major cities, and there is a large bounty on her head. At the time this story takes place Rashel goes to the Lancers, a human organisation for killing vampires and joins in with a small group who're watching a warehouse that has been lately occupied by vampires. Their goal is to catch a vampire and discover its reasons for being there - through torture if need be. Among the group is a young girl named Nyala whose sister was killed by a vampire. Yet when the vampire is caught and the others go to scout around, Rashel finds that to her horror she and the vampire - Quinn (last seen in Daughters of Darkness) are soulmates. Letting him go, Rashel finds that she is suddenly wanted by both sides of the fight - the vampires still have a bounty on her head, and the Lancers think she has defected to the other side.<br />And it doesn't end there. While on the run from both of them Rashel literally runs into a young girl Daphne Childs, who is one of the missing young girls of late. With her in tow Rashel has access to exactly what the vampires are up to. For unknown reasons - though Rashel suspects its the slave trade - girls are being abucted from a club known as the Black Iris by none other than Quinn himself. Rashel's mission is clear - get into the club, become one of these 'chosen' and thus get herself to one of the secret and hidden vampire enclaves. And she'll have to do it by herself...<br />As you can see, the premise is a fascinating one, and there is no shortage of interesting characters and ideas. Not all vampires are bad, not all humans are good so it would seem, and there are enough twists and turns, suspence and excitement to keep most people interested. It draws on things mentioned from the other books - the enclave is probably much like the ones Rowan, Kestrel and Jade escaped from in Daughters of Darkness, and the password that Rashel uses with the Lancers 'the night has a thousand eyes/and the day only one' is re-used in the prophesy in book seven. L. J. Smith extends more on her idea and the nature of the Night World than previously seen, and several characters pop up that will have appearences in other books - namely Hunter and Lily Redfern.<br />The 'mission' plot strand gives the book some focus (too often L. J. Smith's work rambles, changes, backtracks or doesn't know where its going) and the pace is fast and never dwindles.<br />However, there are a few flaws, the nature of which keeps this book from being a 'five-star' novel. The character of Nyala was a complicated and intriguing one - a girl who was slightly mentally unstable. I don't want to give too much away, but for those who have read the books, I felt that she should have perished in the fire. Okay, that's not very nice of me, but a good author should know when to destroy a character for greater impact in the book's progression. But no, L.J. Smith simply *had* to save her, didn't she. She just *had* to have yet another happy, cliche-ridden ending that is so prevailent in so many of her books. To have Nyala has a tragic figure would have been both poignant and heartbreaking - *that's* what we should have come away from the book feeling.<br />Secondly, Daphne Child's part in the book is pretty implausible. Let me get this straight - she manages to escape from the jaws of certain death and is saves by pure chance by Rashel. And when she is faced with what she got away with, she wants to...do it again? Huh? Yes, yes, she's very brave about going back to the Night Club and letting herself get kidnapped, but come on! - it was just plain stupid. No one in real life would ever do this to themselves. It was the same when Rashel was at the docks and she turned around to find all the girls still there - face it, they would have run like deer.<br />It also ended very abruptly - we don't know what is to become of Timmy, of the girls, of the enclave...it ends with simply the boat sailing back to the shore. I for one had many unanswered questions, and since each book tells of a totally different couple, they weren't to be found in the next book.<br />Finally, the use of the name 'Timmy', brought back Lassie flashbacks: 'Oh no, Timmy's down the well!' Unfortunatly this meant whenever Timmy turned up I was plauged by visions of him floudering in water.<br />All in all however, a good read. One of L.J.'s more suspenseful, darker works. Highly recommended in the context of the Night World series.<br />But 'Timmy'?...death and is saves by pure chance by Rashel.

US	39424751	R1VAWY01BRL110	0684855593	420806145	A Midsummer Night's Faery Tale	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Definitely a Keeper!	A collaboration between famous doll-maker Wendy Froud and award-winning author/editor Terri Windling - could you ever ask for a better team? In this beautifully created book the two present the story of the faery Sneezle - small, helpless and over-looked, who is desparate to make a difference on this particular Midsummer Night, the night where all manner of faery creatures join to together in celebrations unknown to Sneezle - he's always sleeped through them! He is determined though that tonight will be different, and immediately goes out in search of something to do to help, though often his attempts cause more harm than good. Finally though he is given a task by Lord Oberon himself, a task so important however that Sneezle doubts his chances to successfully achieve it. With Queen Titania under a strange spell of sleep, Oberon orders Sneezle to fetch her crown from the Heart of the Wood - but a beautiful-yet-dangerous enchantress is out to fetch the crown also, to become Oberon's new queen.<br />If there is something wrong with this book, it is perhaps that the narrative is too complicated. I get the distinct impression that this book will most likely reach the bookshelves of more adults than children, but nevertheless the story often branches out into several tangents that do not quite flow. Though the story starts with Sneezle's quest to find something useful to do and a few encounters with various faery folk, he soon comes across the sleeping Titania. He then goes in search of Oberon, who sends him off to fetch the crown. Then there is Twig, the young faery who (and this I really disliked) wanted time to perfect her appearance before going on a life-or-death quest to fetch the crown. Then there's the matter of the sword and Titania's missing and transformed handmaidens, and of Rianna's several appearances and her adjenda that conflicts with Sneezle's own. Perhaps the intricate, many stranded plot was what Windling was going for, but it doesn't quite come across as the simple `faery tale' that is in the title of the book. I'm not saying that Windling should have made a simple story line that only children would have found enjoyable, nor that I particulary disliked it - just that a few creases in the structure could have been ironed out to make it a more fluid storytelling effort, rather than a rushed and jumbled story. On the other hand, the story is charming, not too sugary (like many other `fairy' tales) and has a good underlining message to just be yourself. This is just a little quibble of mine - nitpicking in the face of an otherwise perfect and beautiful book.<br />Wendy Froud's exquistie dolls are the real reason for purchasing this book. Whether they are the tiny sylph-like faerys or the larger, more solid, graceful humanoid dolls, the distorted and somewhat macabre gnomes and imps or the merticulously crafted unicorns, each one is unquie, beautiful and inspiring. Each one has its own personality, its own individuality and a beautiful costume. Yet although these dolls are positioned within beautifully created sets of woodland scenery and lighted softly and mysteriously, I would not re-hire the photographer they used as he sometimes shoots the dolls from some rather awkward angles. The most obvious example is that of the faery Rianna in the picture where she is leaning forward, her hand extended. The doll herself is utterly perfect, but the actual photograph is off-centre, so that she is positioned well on the left side of the page and her fingers are almost lost in the binding of the book. I assume this was done to keep all of her wings within the picture, but all that needed to be down was photograph her at a different angle. As it is, the photograph almost appears to be part of a much bigger photo that was roughly chopped to fit into the book. Another example is that of Oberon and Titania on the unicorns at the conclusions of the book - Oberon's black unicorn is not only difficult to see, but again nearly lost inthe binding, such is its positioning on the far left side of the page.<br />Yet again, this is another small flaw and never takes away from the beauty of the dolls and the charm of Windling's intricate story. Make sure you get your hands on the next edition - The Winter's Child, and cross your fingers for a third installment in Sneezle's adventures.the binding, such is its positioning on the far left side of the page.<br />Yet again, this is another small flaw and never takes away from the beauty of the dolls and the charm of Windling's intricate story.

US	39424751	R10PH4JKXUJ1XA	0743410017	162515751	The Steps up the Chimney (Maghousquar Series Number 1)	Books	2	3	5	N	N	A Mixed Bag of Magic and Flatness	The Steps up the Chimney is the first in four books that accumulate into the Magician's House Quartet, revolving around three children who come to stay at their uncle's strange house, and Stephen Tyler, a time-travelling wizard who befriends the children on their stay at Golden Valley.<br />In the `Steps Up The Chimney' the children arrive at the house after already experiencing some strange events - Will has meet a stranger at Druce Coven station who mysteriously disappeared and a fox seems to popping up everywhere they look. Within the house and grounds however, things become even more strange - Alice finds footprints in the snow that end abruptly in the middle of a clearing and Mary notices an extra window in the house that shouldn't be there. By researching the house's near-ancient origins and searching high and low, the children eventually come across an amazing discovery - that there are steps up the chimney...<br />These books are highly original - I am a big fantasy reader and there was little in these books that I had run across before in other novels. Among other things the books include time travelling, alchemy, animals that can communicate with the children and the more mundane occurrences of the children's relationship with their uncle and his pregnant girlfriend Phoebe. Although the entire story is set within the valley, the story draws on larger themes that are not only world-wide, but stretch throughout Tyler's time to the present day, the main one being the nature of greed and its evils.<br />William Corlett shows a good knowledge and interest in English history, and is always adding in tidbits of information when describing the building or architecture of the house or grounds, which he no doubt planned and mapped in great detail.<br />Characterisation is, on the whole, very good whether it be the somewhat dithery vegetarian Phoebe, the talkative historian Mrs Prewett or the wide variety of animals that roam the ground such as the fox Cinnabar, the owl Jasper or the dog Sirius (or as Alice calls him - Spot). The wizard however, far from being a main character flits in and out of the story very briefly - his role is firmly restrictive to that of teacher, and a distant teacher at that - there is no real warmth in the relationship between him and the children.<br />Although the title of the book is captivating, many times the story itself falls slightly short of my expectations - often the narrative falls into meaningless history lessons or long-winded descriptions of the nature of alchemy, and much of the story structure relies on the reader having a good visual picture of the house and its features within their head. A map of the house and grounds can be found in each book, but a good idea would have been to include illustrations of many of the diagrams Corlett describes within the book and a family tree to keep track of all the Crawdens, Lewises, Mordens and Tylers that are so often mentioned throughout all four books.<br /><br />Likewise, I could find very little to like with Corlett's protagonists William, Mary and Alice. If Corlett set out to make them - especially Alice - irritable, annoying, whiny, bickersome children, then he succeeded. If he wanted them to be enjoyable, realistic characters than he failed. To illustrate my point, read the passage where the children are getting into Jack's car for the first ride back to Golden House - it spans only two pages but within it Alice and Will fight over the front seat, Will sits on Alice and Alice moans about not getting her way; Alice says to Mary: 'Oh Mary, the last thing we want is one of your history lessons. They're so boring.' and Mary says: 'They're always squabbling. And that's really boring.' Once inside the car Mary talks with Jack about the length of her hair and Alice says: 'Ugh! Stop flirting, Mary. Be careful, Uncle Jack. She's man-mad!'<br />Mary: Honestly, you're such a baby, Alice.<br />Alice: You're blushing! Mary's blushing!<br />Mary: Shutup Alice!<br />See what I mean? If I was Uncle Jack I would have stopped the car and left the little brats to camp out on the train tracks. How we are supposed to find the three of them sympathetic, much less likeable characters I have no idea, and they get even worse as the story progresses.<br />These thoroughly horrible children aside, the books are thoughtful and original - though not the best of their genre, any fantasy reader should be interested enough by this opening novel to continue the story in the next book `The Door in the Tree'.!<br />See what I mean?

US	39424751	R1L6P8NIUEUC3H	0743410025	547599751	The Door In The Tree (The Magician's House Quartet, 2)	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Two Stars equals "Fair"	This is the second book in the `Magician's House Quartet' and sees the three children of the previous novel (`The Steps Up The Chimney') return to their uncle Jack's Golden House, where the year before they had meet a time-travelling wizard called Stephen Tyler, befriended a number of wild animals and mastered the magical art of sharing their bodies, and helped deliver their uncle's girlfriend's baby when the wizard's assistant Morden had attempted to sabotage the birth.<br />The children William, Mary and the youngest Alice are delighted to be back during the short spring break, eager to begin living more of the magic, but are slightly disconcerted to find that nothing out of the ordinary occurs. Just as William begins to doubt the reality of the magic of however, Alice once more joins minds with the dog Spot, who leads her to the Door in the Tree...<br />In this story, the badger sett of the valley is under attack from badger-baiters - a fact the children learn from their new friend, the elderly woman Meg Lewis, who lived by herself in Four Fields where she has appointed herself a guardian of the wildlife in the area - in particular the badgers. When the children discover a dead badger upon the path that Spot calls `The Dark and Dreadful Path', and find several ominous messages signed `the Fang', they realise that something indeed is amiss within the Golden Valley, and once more it's up to them to restore balance.<br />`The Door in the Tree' is a step up from its predecessor `The Steps Up the Chimney' - it takes the children further into the woods and grounds of Golden House to discover further beauties -and harsh truths - of the natural world, a pattern that is continued in the next book `The Tunnel Behind the Waterfall' where the children trek even further to find the lake known as Goldenwater. In this second book the children also find new acquaintances - not just Meg, but animals such as Falco the kestrel, Bawson the badger, Merula the blackbird, and re-appearances from Cinnabar the fox and Jasper the owl.<br />The story is more focussed and to the point - in the previous book suspense is built up only for nothing to happen, but here there are several exciting and interesting occurrences of the children's adventures - especially those that occur during the night. Although disappointingly the door in the tree actually plays a very little part in the story (you never actually learn where it came from), other happenings slowly begin to build up and create tension till the children are once more separated and relying only on their individual talents to resolve the problem. Corlett's descriptions of the children entering the animal's bodies are especially vivid, and his greatest strength is action-sequences (seen used to best effect in the final volume `The Bridge in the Clouds'). Also worth re-reading is the lovely description of Four Fields, Meg's home.<br />However, as it was in the first book, the magician and his evil assistant Morden have very little to do in the main plot strand of the book. Morden appears only as a lurking threat at the back of their minds, and the magician himself Stephen Tyler arrives without warning to spout ideas of philosophy, alchemy and human nature that young readers may find confusing and are perhaps better suited to books of a higher age group than these are intended.<br />There is some more information on the history of the house as told from Meg's point of view - its interesting, but a little hard to piece altogether, especially if you can't quite remember little tidbits of history that were first told in the first book. A timeline or family tree would have been appropriate to chronicle the families that lived in the house - the Crawdens, the Tylers, the Mordens, the Lewises and now the Taylors/Greens.<br />Luckily the children improve - in the first book I could barely stand them due to their quarrelling and rudeness, but here there is a slight improvement on their manners, though Alice still needs a lot of work to make her even remotely likeable - the fuss she makes over Phoebe breastfeeding her baby is vulgar as well poorly written. Parents might not enjoy reading such passages out loud (Alice shrieks out - \\"Boobs! Boobs! Will's got a thing about boobs!). Like the plot strand of Jack and Phoebe's living together without being married, it is too crudely and awkwardly written to belong in a children's book. Other authors have tackled such subject matter with far more sensitivity than Corlett does here.<br />All in all, its an enjoyable enough book, a good continuation of the `Steps Up the Chimney', but nothing overly special, with a few moments that unfortunately drag this series down from what it could have been.eds a lot of work to make her even remotely likeable - the fuss she makes over Phoebe breastfeeding her baby is vulgar as well poorly written.

In fact, the story actually starts years before her birth when the Crown Prince Max, searching for an adventure comes across the dryad Salixia and falls in love with her. Their love story reminded me a bit of 'Aragorn-and-Arwen' or 'Romeo-and-Juliet' for children, as they too are star-crossed lovers: Max is trapped within the confines of his royal duties, just as Salixia is confined to the life of her willow tree and the rules of 'Wild Magic' that condones love between a mortal and a magical creature. But their love is stronger than rules, even when Salixia's tree is destroyed, and a birth of a child seals their bond - a daughter named Betony.<br />Also on the scene within the royal court are the delightful characters Ralph the wizard, who gives a mysterious prophesy over Betony's crib, the wizard-in-training Clover who despises the pink her family makes her wear, Basil the gardener's boy who falls in love with the unabtainable princess, and Rosie, Betony's dear godmother, who may just be a *fairy* godmother!<br />As I mentioned earlier, each chapter tells the tale of an adventure that befalls Betony and her friends and each one is original, imaginative and unconnected to the rest - it reads like a series of short stories, and you can read them out of order. If you read this to children they'll no doubt find a favourite chapter they'll want you to read out over and over again - whether it's Betony discovering her long-lost grandmother Queen Cassandra, King Max frantically hunting down the hobgoblin that gets loose on the ground, Clover learning the secret to unselfish magic, Basil becoming entranced by a treachourous water sprite, Queen Salixia resisting temptation to return to her magical ways by the dragon Windrider or the final love story between Betony and Basil. My personal favourite however, is the encounter between Betony and the unicorn in the chapter \\"Unicorn Dawn\\". There is no silly, sickly-sweet narrative here that is found so commonly in other children's stories about unicorns and young girls who ride them like horses. The author's narrative here is poignant, joyful and bittersweet: it really is the lovelist version of a unicorn tale I have ever read.<br />So I very highly recommend this little gem, and the other 'Floramunde' books - you won't be sorry you picked up this delightful series of tales!unselfish magic, Basil becoming entranced by a treachourous water sprite, Queen Salixia resisting temptation to return to her magical ways by the dragon Windrider or the final love story between Betony and Basil.

Smith's 'Dark Visions' trilogy that began with 'The Strange Power' which introduced us to five teenagers brought to the Zetes Institute to enhance their psychic abilities only to find that the man in charge has plans to change them into a psychic 'swat team'. The trilogy continued with 'The Possessed' in which the five of them (Kaitlyn, Gabriel, Rob, Lewis and Anna) were on the run from Mr Zetes in their search to find a mysterious house from their dreams where the Fellowship lived, a passive Utopian society rich in psychic powers thanks to the power of a large perfect crystal. However, their strict rules of conduct meant that one of their numbers - Gabriel - was forbidden to enter their dwelling-place. Blinded by their goodness and ridgid purity Gabriel summoned Mr Zetes and his band of 'dark psychics' that had dogged the teens on their road trip across the country, and together they destroyed the great crystal, leaving only a shard that was placed in Kaitlyn's care. With the Fellowship disbanded and Gabriel reverted to the 'bad guys', the teenagers only hope seemed to be to destroy the Institute from the inside - by using their crystal shard to destroy Mr Zetes own crystal.<br />As you can see it is impossible to read any of the books out of order as 'The Passion' starts right where the last one ended. Kaitlyn decides to abandon her boyfriend Rob and best friends Anna and Lewis to return to the Institute, in the attempt to both convert Gabriel back to the white hats and find the dark crystal in order to destroy it. She successfully infilterates the Institute and finds herself surrounded by enemies - not only is Gabriel a tad suspicious of her, but there is also her ex-mentor Joyce Piper who betrayed them, Mr Zetes's daughter Lydia, and the malevolent Mr Zetes himself. As well as this are the 'dark psychics' of Mr Zetes former group: John 'Jackal Mac' MacCorkendale, Laurie Frost, Paul 'Renny' Renfrew and Sabrina 'Bri' Jessica Gallo (where does she get these names?!) Along with the new faces comes a new range of psychic abilities such as astral projection, psychometry and dowsing.<br />Other plot strands include the love triangle between Kaitlyn, Rob and Gabriel; the continuing destruction of the Fellowship; Rob, Anna and Lewis's quest to help both Kaitlyn and the comatosed Marisol of book one; Kaitlyn's struggle to find acceptance among the dark psychics; the dark psychic's deadly missions, and of finding Mr Zetes's very first students...<br />A fault however, is that L. J. is far too preoccupied with looks - so much so that it begins to get ridiculous, as are her long-winded descriptions on how beautiful Kaitlyn is; silly descriptions such as \\"a medieval witch princess against the dawn\\" and \\"eyes that people called witchy, smoky blue with darker blue rings in them\\". At one point Kaitlyn actually stands in front of the mirror and thinks to herself - \\"I look extremely witchy. Like someone who might go walking down the street like this, barefoot, hair wild in the breeze, singing strange songs.\\" Please! It's a bit much. Likewise the simile for Rob as a 'golden, avenging angel' is too overused.<br />All in all, fans of L. J. Smith should be satisfied with this concluding novel to the trilogy. Unlike her other books it does not deal as much with supernatural qualities (such as vampires and witches) but many of her trademark features are there such as her famous love triangles. For once her heroine chooses the 'bad boy' - quite unprecedented in L. J.'s history (Cassie chooses Adam over Nick, Elena chooses Stefan over Damon and Jenny chooses Tom over Julian). The dark psychics were interesting despite their wackiness - I hope everybody noticed they were symbolic opposites of the original five (two boys, two girls in each group with Gabriel as the fifth member of both). The story wraps up quite quickly for a swift happy ending, but all loose ends are tied up and readers get the standard happily ever after they were hoping for.ly ever after they were hoping for.	2002-10-14

Smith Collection	She's done vampires, witches and shadow-creatures, and in this trilogy L. J. Smith tackles psychics, namely five psychics in particular - Kaitlyn Fairchild, Rob Kessler, Gabriel Wolfe, Anna Whiteraven and Lewis Chao (where does she get these names?)<br />In the first book 'The Strange Power' the five teenagers were united by Emmanuel Zetes and his lackey Joyce Piper under the pretence of helping them control and understand their individual psychic abilities whilst also educating them and supplying them with scholarships for university. However, the teens found out eventually that this was not the case - what Mr Zetes was really up to was to change them into a 'psychic swat-team' and sell their psychic services off to the highest bidder. Horrified, the teens flee the house, which is where 'The Possession' picks up, but with a few differences: all five of them are telepathically linked with each other, and one of their members - Gabriel - is now forced to feed off other people's energy in order to survive.<br />So where 'The Strange Power' was an introduction to the teens and their powers (which include healing abilities, animal communication, telepathy, future divination and telekinesis) and 'The Passion' is Kaitlyn's infilteration back into the Zetes Institute, 'The Possession' is the journey of the five runaways to find the mysterious house that they have all dreamt of - a white house over a strech of water where voices call out to them.<br />On their road-trip however, they have to deal with the continuous presence of each other in their minds, the police, their parents, the mysterious location of their white house, Gabriel's need for human substanence, a new arrival, and an onslaught of attacks from Mr Zetes and his 'dark psychics' - those students who had come before them under Mr Zetes's tutorledge. However they are not without their own resources - their own powers guide and substain them, and they find allies in Anna's parents, Tony - the brother of Marisol (who had been a helper at the Zetes Institute and purposely put in a coma by Mr Zetes), an intriguing newcomer by the name of Lydia, and of course the mysterious beings of the white house - a climax that does not disappoint.<br />L. J. Smith again creates good, solid, interesting characters - especially those of the psychics and their individual talents - and she is a master of creating the 'bad boy', in this case Gabriel Wolfe. You only need to have a look at some of the other reviews to see how he effects pre-teens. Likewise Kaitlyn is a strong heroine, though L. J. spends a bit too much time describing her appearance and how beautiful she is (just once I'd like to see an unattractive L. J. Smith heroine!) and backup characters are likewise interesting and realistic. I especially appreciated the 'shades of grey' L. J. places within the books - there are not simply black and white/good and evil characters but rather those that hover on the boundries such as Lydia, Gabriel, and even to some extent Kaitlyn herself. Gabriel's revelation at the climax of the books when he is faced with pure (though ridgid) goodness and realises he can never become part of it is especially thought-provoking.<br />There are a few faults however - all her descriptions of psychic phenomena (such the feelings the psychics experience, the power of the crystal, the psychic attacks, the 'third eye' business and the transfering of people's energy into Gabriel) are rather difficult to grasp. Gabriel's description as a 'psychic vampire' I felt was a bit much, especially since L. J. Smith conveniantly makes the neck the best transfer place for energy and it was only young women that Gabriel 'feasted' on - it got a little too vampiric for me, and I thought these books were to be about *psychics*, not drawing out ideas from her previous books.<br />Likewise, the teenagers never seem to actually *use* their psychic abilities - Kaitlyn draws pictures, but essentially her premonitions are useless as shecan never stop what they show her is to pass. On the other hand Lewis and Anna seem to have extrodinarily useful powers, but they use them only once each on the entire journey.<br />But anyway, if you are an L. J. Smith fan, then these books shouldn't disappoint. As usual, you have to get all three of them and read them in order to get the full benefit of them, but once again L. J. delievers what she promises with her token mystery, suspence, love triangle, teenage protaginists, 'bad boy' and touches of the supernatural.n never stop what they show her is to pass.

US	39424751	R2YK37XI1HXGOQ	0316770922	122495920	The Crystal Mountain	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Just Lovely!	If it were up to me, I'd make sure every single children's bookshelf had at least one of Ruth Sanderson's wonderful books. Her stories are simple, sweet, and yet thought-provoking, and her illustrations are clear, uncluttered and utterly beautiful. 'The Crystal Mountain' is no exception, and definitely up there as one of her best works.<br />As she did with 'The Golden Mare, the Firebird and the Magic Ring', Sanderson ingeniusly combines more than one fairy or folk tale to create a story that is both new and familiar. In this case she borrows from the Chinese story - 'The Magic Brocade' and the traditional Norwegian tale of 'The Princess on the Glass Hill', to tell the tale of Anna, a famous seamstress who has a dream that she is determined to create on her loom. When the beautiful tapestry of her Eden-like house and garden is complete, it is unfortunatly stolen away by the fairies so that they might make a copy. Anna is desparate to have her precious tapestry back and so sends her three sons Leon, Blaine and Perrin out after it. Though Leon and Blaine soon give up on their quests, Perrin journeys on with the aid of three magical horses till he reaches the Crystal Mountain, and the fairies within...<br />As the editorial review noted, it is not simply a mere 'happily ever after' finish, but ends on a note that lets one's mind drift on the possibilites, and for a nice change it is the female who decides her own fate (ie the Fairy of Red *chooses* to stay with Perrin, rather than him just carry her off) and the two elder brothers aren't punished for their sloth, but rather are forgiven.<br />Overall, this book is a must for fairytale lovers, a wonderful addition to a children's library and delight for those who love beautiful picture books.	2002-10-06

Apart from adding it to their collection, I can't see any seasoned Tolkien-fans finding any new information in his book, especially if they've been tracking the progress of the movies on television documentaries or in magazines.<br />The book is divided into sections, starting with a brief history of the One Ring and the Last Alliance, and continuing with the species of Middle Earth, followed by characters of this particular race and the places in which they live. For example, Chapter Three begins with a brief introduction to Elves, then follows with biographies of Elrond, Arwen, Legolas and Galadriel, with Lothlorien added in. The last segment is dedicated to 'The Dark Powers', in particular the Ringwraiths and the various types of orcs.<br />Jude Fisher obviously knows her stuff, and somehow manages to stay true to both the movie and the books without contradicting one or the other. She adds in small details and features of the places and characters that were not (and presumably will never) be mentioned in the movies, such as Sam's father's name, the nature of the Istari, Elrond's ancestry and the symbolic nature of the Evenstar, and how it is also Arwen's second alias. There are also many insights into the character's personalities that may not have been entirely obvious to the average movie-goer, such as Elrond being Arwen's father (believe it or not their relationship was never specified fully in the movie - though Arwen mentions 'my father', she does not name him) and Pippen's innocent nature as the youngest of the hobbits. Also, weapons of each characters and their different attributes and strengths lent to the quest are described.<br />Furthermore, there are several quotes scattered throughout the book in italics, some directly from the movie and some from the books (although these ones may have come from deleted scenes).<br />The real reason for getting this book however, is for the photographs. Most (not all) are entirely crisp, clear beautiful movie stills or publicity shots of the characters and locations that cover either a whole page, are spread over two pages, or are clips added within the text. Features such as make-up, set design and costuming become even more awe-inspiring when seen up close. However, some are a little fuzzy - mostly the screen shots that cover two pages, and the one of Lothlorien (in my edition at least) has a strange violet print in the lower right hand corner. It doesn't effect any important details, but it still shouldn't be there.<br />Finally, there is a fold out map in the centre of the book, which is a little difficult to fold back into the book since the edges of the map must be carefully slipped into the spine lest the pages fold. However, the map is useful and the pictures lovely.<br />Just for interest's sake, owners of this book might want to turn to page 29 and the picture of Boromir. He is clearly wearing a different outfit from the one he wore throughout the entire 'Fellowship' movie - is this perhaps a picture from the Two Towers when he features in a flashback?

US	39424751	R3DDF4CVZ7VSS8	0152016570	798446971	Here There Be Witches	Books	3	2	2	N	N	An Interesting Anthology of Witches	Jane Yolen's latest anthology (preceeded by 'Here There Be Dragons' and 'Here There Be Unicorns') is centred around the topic of witches and holds a wide range of writing styles, whether it be poetry, short stories, retelling of legends or dialouge. This variety of these stories and their tones sometimes makes a rather mish-mashed collection; the serious stories don't quite fit with the light-hearted ones and you feel as if they should be in separate books. On the other hand, the range means that there's something for everyone and one gets to see the many sides of witches and their crafts. David Wilgus' black-and-white illustrations are greatly responsible for my enjoyment of this book - he is able to create beauty and realism in each one, no matter how fantasic the subject matter is. I especially like the front and back cover - an old woman on the front, but a beautiful youthful one on the back - but the same snake-ring they were is testimony that they're the same person!<br />Yolen starts each piece of writing with a short, conversation-like introduction telling the reader how she got the inspiration for each story, what they're about and how she went about writing them, which adds further interest to the stories themselves.<br />There are seventeen pieces of work altogether. The poems are: 'The Magic House' - a poem about the famous Gingerbread House, 'Witch's Cat' - about the witch's best-known familiar, 'A Conversation Amoung Witches' a rhyming chant of the witches, 'Pythagoras' about the famous wizard philosopher, 'Weird Sisters' a rather dark poem that uses witches as metaphors for a young girl's life, 'When Love Came to Witch Alfre' a lighter poem about a witch who falls in love, and 'Witch Call' about famous witches in history.<br />Also in the book are stories suited for more grown-up readers such as 'Boris Chernevsky's Hands' a science-fiction type story that stars the famous witch Baga Yaga who helps out a young man dissatisfied with his clumsy hands, and 'Circles' about a young woman living in an abusive home who learns the secrets of casting witch circles and wishing on them.<br />Humourous stories include 'The Passing of the Eye' about a politically correct knight who comes across three witches and 'When I Grow Up, by Michael Dee' the essay of a boy who is about to be initiationed into the family business of becoming a warlock. As well as this there is 'Witchfinder', the story of a woman accused of witchcraft from many different viewpoints.<br />My favourites however, and in my opinion Yolen's best, are her re-tellings of old fairytales and her creation of new ones. These are 'The Face in the Cloth', the story of a young Princess struggling to become her own person despite her having her mother's face stitched onto the hood of her cloak, and 'The Promise' about two young people, Kay and Kaya, who are given a promise that they will marry only to be separated by an evil sorcerer when Kay is turned into a fish and lives (unknown to Kaya) in her fishpond. This one's probably my favourite, along with 'The Witch's Ride' about a man who marries the town's beauty only to wake up every morning to find himself more tired than he was the night before. His mother investigates and discovers rather startling truths about his bride...<br />Then there is 'The Woman Who Loved a Bear' the retelling of an old Native-American story about a Cheyenne woman who meets and is protected by a large bear.<br />Lastly there is a the rather long story concerning Yolane's favourite subject - Arthurian legend. In this one she distorts the tale of the Sword in the Stone a little by having 'Merlinnus' create the stone and the sword *after* Arthur is considered king. And it's not exactly Arthur who pulls out the sword...This one isn't exactly my favourite, but Yolane's love of the old legends shines through with every word.<br />All in all, though some stories didn't quite strike my fancy, and others were obviously borrowed from other sources (although she does try to explain herself!) this is a quite good collection of witchy stories that is sure to set off some ideas of your own, and will keep witch-loving kids occupied for some time.hough she does try to explain herself!) this is a quite good collection of witchy stories that is sure to set off some ideas of your own, and will keep witch-loving kids occupied for some time.	2002-09-20

Now that I'm eighteen I still love these books, not so much for the riddles but for the amazing and merticulous photographs, some of which just *beg* to have a story written about them (such as 'The Ghost in the Attic' photograph on pages 14-15). Each photograph has some sort of an enigma or mystery involved in it, whether it be messages written in the letters on building blocks, lost puzzle pieces or clues to a secret birthday party.<br />A complaint was made that 'I Spy Mystery' has no story to it. This is because this book was one of Wick/Marzollo's earlier editions, and it is only with their latest books - 'I Spy Spooky House' and 'I Spy Treasure Hunt' that they add a plot thread. But there is a theme in the other books, and this one is obviously 'mystery'. Each photograph is intriguing, and each riddle has a specific object to find that harks back to many old mystery and adventure books that you may have read as a child, whether it be 'the missing key to the chest', 'proof that the cat knocked over the can', 'the stolen diamond ring' or 'the pirate's X'. These types of clues add an extra dimension to the pictures and children will be more drawn into the hunt for the objects in the pictures, and as I mentioned before there is no end to the inspiration the photographs create - these are the perfect books to use to kindle a child's imagination.<br />It isn't just the riddles at the bottom of each page that will keep you occupied, there are more mysteries to be found at the back of the book: riddles that have to be matched to the photos, a charm bracelet that had its charms scattered throughout the pages, a cat that can be found in every page and a heart shaped box that's lost all its contents - these too are concealed throughout the book.<br />All in all, this is one of the better 'I Spy' books - in particular the photographs 'The Birthday Hunt', 'The Golden Cage', 'The Ghost in the Attic' 'The Secret Note' and 'Chain Reaction' are particularly well made.<br />P.S. (spoiler) To the reviewer who had trouble finding the 'dolphin' in the photograph 'The Naughty Kittens', it can be found on page 24 in the large tree. Look closely at the green on the right-hand side and you can see that it frames the blue shape of a dolphin against the blue background.his is one of the better 'I Spy' books - in particular the photographs 'The Birthday Hunt', 'The Golden Cage', 'The Ghost in the Attic' 'The Secret Note' and 'Chain Reaction' are particularly well made. <br />P.S.

US	39424751	R663SS3IJBWZD	0020427859	400011174	Over Sea, Under Stone	Books	5	3	3	N	N	My Personal Favourite in the Series	'Over Sea, Under Stone' is the first book in Susan Cooper's series 'The Dark is Rising' and the title refers to the location of the legendary Holy Grail. The siblings Simon, Jane and Barney Drew come to stay with their elusive Great-Uncle Merry during the summer holidays in Cornwall and during a rainy afternoon that they discover an old map that Merry tells them will direct them towards the hiding place of the Grail. Though it may sound like just another holiday-adventure story, other occurances are already on the move to suggest that other beings are also on the hunt for the Grail - and not entirely natural beings either. With each day that passes the stakes are raised higher and higher, and the race becomes more and more desparate as the two side struggle to be the first to reach the treasure.<br />The three main protagnists are used very well in putting together the pieces of the story - Susan Cooper makes it clear in her use of their individual strengths and weaknesses that they had to work together, each pulling their own weight, in order to reach a successful conclusion. They each have little adventures of their own that contribute to the storyline and reflect their personalities - eldest child Simon *tries* takes the role of responsible leader, Jane is sensitive and practical, and Barney the youngest is typically devil-may-care, but yet also oddly spiritual. The author carefully balances these positives with negatives - Simon can get arrogant, Jane is a worrier, and Barney often acts implusively: all of which help the reader see the three of them not only as real characters, but as individuals.<br />She also creates quite strong supporting characters, the main one being Great-Uncle Merry, who obviously knows more than what he's saying, and is more than what he seems. The agents of the Dark are also intriguing, whether it be the tall-dark-and-sinister (and very scary) Mr Hastings, the Wither siblings who hide behind their smiles, or the bulky, sullen Bill Hoover.<br />For many reasons, 'Over Sea, Under Stone' is my favourite book in the series, whereas other readers seem to think it is the weakest book. The basis for this judgement would appear to be a lack of fantasy and supernatural elements (especially when compared to the other books), as well as a lack of understanding in the Drew children as to what they are truly up against. This however, is *precisely* why this book is my favourite! The children are naieve for much of the novel's progression, and though the reader can bask in the knowledge that not all is what is seems, they too are kept in the dark as to the 'baddies' true nature, giving a remarkable edge to the book. Upmost satisfaction is to be had as the children experience light touches of supernatural occurances (the prime example being the dog Rufus's eerie howl at the exactly the right moment...but I won't give it away) and the entire atmosphere of the book can be summed up in Jane's realisation - \\"it was though they were not fighting people, but a dark force that used people as their tools\\". This passage sent shivers up my spine, and is indeed the entire tone of the novel - a sunny holiday and adventure story with the children dealing with forces just beyond their understanding. This is a very subtle and clever way of telling a story.<br />The gradual building up of tension and desparation was such a major factor in my enjoyment of the book that I was rather alarmed when I came to read the second book 'The Dark is Rising' and was launched immediatly into a fanatistical story involving time-travelling, magic and a more clear-cut version of the two sides - the Light and the Dark. It took a while to get used to this sudden change in story-telling technique, though still enjoyed the book overall.<br />Lastly, there was a complaint that the children said 'jolly-good' and 'smashing' a few too many times. The book was first printed in 1961, of course they're going to talk like that! If anything, the language adds to the time period the book is set in, and no doubt our children's children will be scoffing at Ron Weasley's use of the word 'Wicked!' when they read the Harry Potter books.to the time period the book is set in, and no doubt our children's children will be scoffing at Ron Weasley's use of the word 'Wicked!' when they read the Harry Potter books.	2002-09-18

It is obviously a darker novel than all previous novels of L. M. Montgomery based around the Blythe family, and I consider it more of a 'spinoff' from her previous books than a continuation despite what the cover of the book says, calling it 'Anne of Green Gables Novel #8'. In fact, if a new-comer to Montgomery's novels were to read this and then her previous books they would find the tone and content so different one might suspect a different author. There is no light-hearted mischief-making here, no long poetic passages describing the beauty of the countryside expect in a bittersweet sense, and hardly any introductions of new, quirky characters (in fact any old, quirky characters are in short supply!)<br />The novel is centred entirely around the war, and of Rilla's experiences through it, and in this context it is a well written war story - the divided feelings of glorious battle and will to fight for one's country and the dread of facing the horrors of war, and the neverending frustration and helplessness of the women left at home. When tragedy strikes the Blythe family one feels it has painfully as they do, and the four-year vigil of Dog Monday at the train station for his master's return is incredibly poignant. But taking up most of Rilla's time is her sweet (but rather uneventful when compared with the courtship of Anne and Gilbert) romance with Kenneth Ford and her 'adoption' of infant 'Jims' from the Anderson house who she brings home in a soup tureen and who forces her into premature adulthood. However, I would warn one not to get too interested in this 'baby plot' as it is handled rather badly. For a long amount of time she doesn't even *like* the baby, the relationship is never fully explored, and the departure of Jims into his father's care is related to us in hindsight. The baby exists only as a rather needless plot point and even Rilla's growth as a person is only partly due to Jim's presence. However, Montgomery succeeds in creating a powerful war drama, and one that leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, especially with the knowledge that it is only a matter of years before World War Two rolls around.<br />As an 'Anne of Green Gables' story, it doesn't quite work, and fans reading this book as the end and climax of the saga may be sorely disappointed. Rilla, Walter and Susan take the spotlight in this novel, and Anne is reduced to a secondary - perhaps even a minor character. She is always refered to as 'Mrs Blythe' or 'Mrs Doctor, dear' and none of her experiences or feelings are expressed to the reader. Many characters are ommitted entirely, leaving one wondering how they managed during the war (such as Owen and Leslie, Diana, and the hundreds of other characters that Anne (and we) came to know and love in the previous books). Even Nan, Shirley, Faith, Carl, Jerry, Di and Una are barely mentioned, making one wonder why Montgomery bothered setting up their characters and personalities in 'Rainbow Valley' if she was simply going to ignore them in the last book. Furthermore, if 'Rilla of Ingleside' is read as the last novel in the series, it suddenly makes all the other books seem unbearably sad. When one reads of Anne and Gilbert's youth, or the childhoods of their children, one is always aware of the shadow looming over them, not just of the war, but of the inescapable truth that the children must grow up, and beloved Anne must grow elderly.<br />Take my advice and try to detach yourself from all the previous books in the series when reading 'Rilla', and think to yourselves that Anne's story ended happily in 'Anne of Ingleside'. 'Rainbow Valley' and 'Rilla's drastic tone and plot tangents from the previous novels make this easy to do so.'Rilla's drastic tone and plot tangents from the previous novels make this easy to do so.	2002-09-15
US	39424751	R3A8PQ8DYLD51P	043906628X	316743855	A Glory Of Unicorns	Books	3	24	31	N	N	Not quite what the introduction promises	Bruce Coville (the complier and editor of this anthology) promised in his introduction no sappy unicorns, tells us that unicorn love is hard and demanding, and unicorns themselves neither safe nor sweet. However, four stories into this book I found that was exactly what the book was delievering - sweet, dreamy, dear little unicorns. Contradicting his own words Coville brings us the story of 'The Guardian of Memory' in which unicorns have names such as 'Arabella Skydancer' and 'Manda Seafoam' and are entirely domesticated, speaking unicorns. Likewise, nearly every other author in this book seems to have no knowledge of true unicorn lore - that these incredibly shy creatures, who dwelt in the Garden of Eden, could only possibly be approached by a pure virgin maiden and even then *never* ridden. Many of the stories have unicorns as tame, human-loving creatures, and one only need read the poem 'The Dream-Child' to get the general attitude towards unicorns in this collection: lines like \\"starlight spinning down your spiraled horn/the dream-child, the cloud-maned\\". *Sigh*.<br />However, I am being rather harsh in this assessment, as this book is obviously meant for young girls, and my expectations were no doubt far too high. Young unicorn lovers, who are quite happy to view unicorns as magical horses will be quite content with such a collection and some of the stories aren't so sickly-sweet that parents won't find enjoyment in reading them aloud.<br />A few that rise above the par are 'Tearing Down the Unicorns', the only story that addresses the issue of today's views on unicorns being adorable little ponies; 'Child of Faerie', a nicely written and conceived story of Afton, a faerie child who chose to live for a while in the human world, but is now being called back to her true home when her human family needs her most; and 'The Ugly Unicorn', the creation of an Oriental myth of a young blind girl mistakingly believing that the ugly Liu-mu is the beautiful Poh unicorn.<br />Girls already initiated into Coville's 'Luster' series will no doubt love his 'Guardian of Memory' story, set in the same world, and parents as well as children should like 'The Healing Truth', the story of a complusive liar that finds a unicorn in a supply closet; 'A Song for Croaker Nordge' of an old man who places his hopes of finding a unicorn on his grand-daughter and 'Story Hour', the tale of an old woman teaching her grand-daughter the secrets of finding a unicorn but keeping it secret by telling her the story of the Goblin King.<br />Other stories destined to be less popular because of their ambiguity are 'Beyond the Fringe,' in which an old woman weaves a carpet for her family as bandits raid their village, 'The Unicorns of Kabustan' in which a boy hiding from war releases a series of unicorns that try to put an end to the fighting, 'Stealing Dreams', of a boy who finds a unicorn in his wallpaper and 'The New Girl', a short tale of a unicorn caretaker desparate to leave the confines of her small village. And of course, the sugary-sickness of the poem 'The Dream-Child.'<br />Another saving grace is Alix Berenzy's lovely black-and-white illustrations.<br />Read this book at your own enjoyment, but be aware that you are not reading about 'real' unicorns - only the idealised, modernised unicorns by authors who have forgotten what a unicorn really is./>Girls already initiated into Coville's 'Luster' series will no doubt love his 'Guardian of Memory' story, set in the same world, and parents as well as children should like 'The Healing Truth', the story of a complusive liar that finds a unicorn in a supply closet; 'A Song for Croaker Nordge' of an old man who places his hopes of finding a unicorn on his grand-daughter and 'Story Hour', the tale of an old woman teaching her grand-daughter the secrets of finding a unicorn but keeping it secret by telling her the story of the Goblin King.<br />Other stories destined to be less popular because of their ambiguity are 'Beyond the Fringe,' in which an old woman weaves a carpet for her family as bandits raid their village, 'The Unicorns of Kabustan' in which a boy hiding from war releases a series of unicorns that try to put an end to the fighting, 'Stealing Dreams', of a boy who finds a unicorn in his wallpaper and 'The New Girl', a short tale of a unicorn caretaker desparate to leave the confines of her small village.

US	39424751	R37QEEOWQWRZOK	0670892475	811702170	Treasure at the Heart of the Tanglewood (Action Packs)	Books	3	5	5	N	N	A Mute Fox, a Mysterious Forest, and a Flower-headed Girl	'Treasure at the Heart of the Tanglewood' can be best described as a story set out in three distinct parts. The first (and most interesting) introduces us to Hannah - a young girl who lives in the Tanglewood with flowers and vines growing in her hair who must be plucked out regularly to make a drought for the Wizard that lives in the forest's heart. Apart from him, the folks of a nearby village, and her talking animal friends, the only people she comes across are the namy nameless knights that go into the Tanglewood, searching for it's mythological treasure. With one particular knight however, Hannah falls in love. She names him Foxkith, and tries to keep him from the death that inevitably awaits him.<br />Part Two tells of Hannah's journey into the world, trying to find Foxkith's sorcerer-queen. On the way, Hannah's hair and clothes change in colour and form, as the seasons change around her. It is here that the story begins to slow, as we become aware of the truth of things long before Hannah and her comrades do.<br />By Part Three, when Hannah reaches Foxkith's island home and the wind-up begins, we already know everything the 'sorcerer-queen' has to say. Consequently, it isn't that interesting.<br />The fairy tale elements of the story bear a great resemblance to the Greek myth of Persephone - when this goddess walked the world it was spring and summer, when she returned to her husband in the underworld, it became autumn and winter. Another familiar motif present us the triad of goddesses of many ancient religions - Crone, Mother and Maiden, although in this story it becomes Mother, Matron and Maiden. Along with these three titles to describe Hannah and her mother, Hannah is also refered to, not only as Brown, Green, Golden or Russet Hannah, but as the Spring Maid, the Summer Girl, the Autumn Lass or the Winter Damsel. Needless to say, all the titles can get a bit confusing.<br />This is not Pierce's best work, (disappointing after a five year absence) especially when compared to the brilliance of the Darkangel trilogy, but it *is* a worthwhile read. Meredith Ann Pierce is a masterful storyteller, and all of her works are unique. Despite the faults, the story is intriguing, drawing on ancient stories and giving them a new look, setting them in a believable fantasy world. It reads like a fleshed-out fairytale, and the though the ending is predictable, the beginning draws you in in far enough that you are compelled to keep on reading.hen compared to the brilliance of the Darkangel trilogy, but it *is* a worthwhile read.

Despite still coming to terms with her mother's sudden and enigmatic death, Lauren is delighted to be back at her godmother's house where she spent her childhood summers. But things have changed for her godmother Jules and her two children: Nora is disturbed and unstable, Holly moves between friendliness and jealously, and Jule seems to think the best course of action is to ignore them both. As well as this there's Nick, a friend from Lauren's youth who's grown into a charming handsome young man. Lauren falls for him instantly, but Holly informs her that the two of them are dating. Then strange things begin to happen - Lauren finds mysterious knots in necklaces, plants, ropes, cords and clothing that appear as if by magic, and Nora claims that Lauren's mother is in the boathouse - hiding there by day and swimming in the ocean by night to search for her little girl. When Lauren is thrown into several dangerous situations - small at first, but gradually more and more deadly - she begins to fear that someone is out to claim her life. No one will believe her accusations against Nora, and the only thing Lauren does know is that the series of events are linked somehow to her mother's death, and her own re-appearance in Wisteria.<br />Overall, this is an enjoyable book - it's pacing is quick and fluid and though it takes it's time with details of the prom and the beach party, it never moves too faraway from the mystery surrounding Lauren and her deceased mother. The writing is clear and solid, the plot coherent and the characters interesting. Lauren is overall a likeable heroine that one can relate to, though she has some strange reactions to events - I would have freaked out had I gone into my room to find everything tied in knots - however, Lauren is quite calm even after it happens *twice*. It is also difficult to understand Lauren's affection for Jules, Holly and Nora when they are written as being not very nice people. However, the romance is unique and therefore refreshing - Nick is a bit of a womaniser while Lauren is more naieve, and their first kiss takes place in the pouring rain with a shower curtain draped over their heads for shelter!The wind-up was a little rushed, with two rather life-changing truths being revealed in quick succession, with no time for reactions to either one, let alone adjustments to them.<br />I'm puzzled as to why this book is in a series, as the only similarities to 'Dark Secrets: A Legacy of Lies' is the location - Wisteria - and a few passing comments to the Scarboroughs and Mrs Lydia. Other than that the two don't link at all, and I don't see why they aren't isolated novels.<br />Though this is not a memorable book, it is enjoyable, with an intriging plot, realistic characters, funny moments and a big twist. This would be a good book to take on a trip - an entertaining way to pass the time without straining too many brain cells.cult to understand Lauren's affection for Jules, Holly and Nora when they are written as being not very nice people.

Smith fans swooning in the aisles.<br />It is an interesting premise, and things start to heat up when the girls arrive at their great-aunt Opal Burdock's house in Briar Creek only to find her staked through the heart. Panicking, they bury the body in the garden outside, but are witnessed by Mary-Lynette who's watching the stars on the hill overlooking the house. Doubtful that Mrs Burdock is really dead, Mary-Lynette and her brother nevertheless investigate, and come across the vampire sisters hunting in the wood...<br />However, because Mark and Jade fall pretty fast for each other a truce is made and the sisters share their fears with the two siblings - something is out there, something that's killing things, and all of them work their dectective skills to figure out who it is ... Ash? Bunny Marten, the shop attendant with the lamia name? Jeremy, the garage worker with a deep, dark secret? A vampire hunter?<br />And then Ash turns up, and to his and Mary-Lynette's horror, they find they are soulmates, destined to be together even though Ash is not a very nice guy.<br />The story is pretty interesting, and it's fun to guess whodunnit, though I admit I was a *little* disappointed as to the murderer's motives. L.J. Smith obviously had fun designing the three sisters, all with different personalities and features. For once there wasn't a contrived happy ending that is so popular in L.J. Smith's books, and the atmosphere of the book was very well done too - the desert-like Briar Creek gave a sense of being trapped in the middle of nowhere with a wild beast on the loose, and chemistry between all the characters was realistic, poignent, and sometimes funny. (Watch out for Ash giving Jeremy a hard time).<br />All in all, this was a much better book than the first 'Secret Vampire', which extented the Night World a bit, and mingled together characters that have been in previous books (Ash) and characters who'll appear in future ones (Quinn).y between all the characters was realistic, poignent, and sometimes funny.

US	39424751	R1C9B8P64ODY5X	0688154921	935348000	The Time of the Ghost	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Clever, but Complicated	The title of this book - 'The Time of the Ghost' is a definite clue as to what themes to expect in this novel - 'time' and 'ghosts'. It begins with an unidentified 'ghost' who has an overwhelming feeling that a terrible accident has occured, though she cannot remember any details. As she travels through a boys boarding school, little bits and pieces of memory come back to her - she suspects she is one of four sisters - Imogen, Sally, Charlotte or Fenella, who through a game they called 'The Worship of Monigan', have brought to life a terrible goddess. The sisters begin to believe that they are being haunted and seek out the ghost's knowledge, while one of the school students Julian Addiman, has a secret adjenda with Monigan himself. The ghost continues to piece together her past, but all the time wondering - who is she? Where is she from? Why is she here? What should she do?<br />If you want the answers to the questions then don't expect to find them at the beginning/middle of the story - you'll have to hang in there till the end. Like all Wynne Jones's stories nothing is what it seems, not even the premise of the story - you may assume that the 'ghost' is a ghost, and that events run in chronological order, but don't be fooled. Reality and assumptions turn themselves upside and round-about on more than one occasion. Whether you like this book or not, you'll have to appreciate the cleverness and complexity of the story that takes a very unique imagination to design.<br />However, this story lacks any explanitory narrative, which deeply confuses the reader, and leaves them confused till the end of the story, or perhaps even until a second read of the book. It would have been so much simpler to have a few 'eye-of-god' paragraphs to just explain to the audience what is going on in a few situations. However this is made impossible, as the viewpoint of this novel is strictly that of the ghost's. The closet we get to explanations are dialouges by other characters as the plot catapults along.<br />This is the typical style of all Diana Wynne Jones's novels, and in my opinion, her downfall. The lack of black and white, clear-cut explanations as to what is going on confuses most readers and prevents her from getting into the league of other fanatasy writers such as J.K. Rowling.<br />This book is a good, memorable one with a clever, well thought out plot. The only problem is that is Wynne Jones gives us no way to appreciate this as we go along, but makes us wait till the very end of the book to explain what was happening the whole time. Therefore, 'The Time of the Ghost' reads like a guessing-game, and you have to piece together the plot as you go, without really knowing whether your holding the right pieces.plot catapults along.<BR>This is the typical style of all Diana Wynne Jones's novels, and in my opinion, her downfall.

I can't see anyone who doesn't watch the show reading one of the novelisations, but in case you *do* fall into this catagory, here's the lowdown: Prue, Piper and Phoebe are the Charmed Ones, three of the most powerful witches in the world, each blessed with special powers: Prue is telekinetic and has recently acquired the power of astral projection, Piper can 'freeze time' - anything caught in her power freezes immediatly, like when you press the 'pause' button on T.V., and Phoebe has psychic visions, usually of people in trouble or of impending danger. Their task is to protect the innocent against warlocks, demons and other nasties.<br />'The Legacy of Merlin' seems to take place mid-way through the second season - Prue still works at Bucklands and has the power of astral projection, and Piper is re-assessing her relationship with Leo (Dan does not seem to be on the scene yet). It begins with Prue travelling to England to track down some old and rare books for collectors back in San Francisco, and Piper and Phoebe trag along for the holiday. Phoebe, who is eagar to explore the land of Camelot and King Arthur begins searching the old bookstores where she mets a handsome stranger - Niell Oldman, and is immediatly struck by a vision: Niell holding a baby on a windy moor, mixed with a feeling of love and sadness. Niell is a strange character - he is rather startled by technology in all forms, and speaks of magic and legends as if he truely believed in them. Phoebe falls for him pretty fast, but Prue, who sees him with a striking woman named Diana in the village, is more suspicious. Things start to get more mysterious as Piper comes across a gathering of Druids, with Diana and Niell in the centre of their ritual. Niell explains - he is Merlin's son, who Diana summoned from ancient Camelot in order to have a child with her, who she assumes will be very powerful. To send Niell home, Piper and Prue time-travel to ancient Camelot to find Merlin and a spell that will send Niell back, while Phoebe and Niell try to combat Diana and save Mrs Jeffries, an elderly woman that Diana plans to sacrifice.<br />Some things don't make sense - for instance, Niell tells the sisters that Diana doesn't have much power, which is why she wants a baby with him, but I assume summoning someone from four hundred years ago isn't an easy feat. And why did Niell go along with her? He didn't know the meaning of the word fight? Furthermore, assuming that her baby with Niell would be all-powerful, and the way she filled up Niell's mind with a history of the world are rather implausible.<br />As well as this, the book is obviously intented for young people, not adults, and the font and writing style makes it ideal for people 10-14. Adults who enjoy the show will get no pleasure from these juvenile books, which is unfortunate because (at least where I live) 'Charmed' is rated adults only on television.<br />The intended audience however will enjoy, and no doubt be able to skim over the cliches, tacky love story, plot holes and Piper's subplot of creating a love potion that backfires, which I think is supposed to be humerous.a summoned from ancient Camelot in order to have a child with her, who she assumes will be very powerful.

I was still up at three in the morning trying to finish it; it was that captivating. It has all the components of a fairytale, and yet is worked into a fantasy novel that includes vampires, gargoyles and other strange and macabre creatures. Don't be put off by the word 'vampire' though, this book isn't yet another vampire book of that most over-used genre, but an incredible story with a huge scope and scale that stretches from a small village, to the vampire's forbidden castle, to a seemingly endless desert. It begins when a young Aerial's mistress is kidnapped upon the hills by a dark angel, or a vampire. Taking it upon herself to rescue her, she sets off on a wonderful journey that includes characters you've only ever seen in myths and legends. With her bravery, kindness and story-telling abilities Aerial gradually begins to lighten the darkangel's world and teach him of his own dark heritage.<br />I read this book when I was thirteen, but when I went back to the library to get it out again, it was gone! But ... I've finally found it again, and I'm just about to go down to the public library to order it. I've never read the third book in this trilogy - 'The Pearl of the Soul of the World', but upon looking at reviews, I see there is a character called Ravenna in it! What a fluke, as my nickname was Ravenna long before I even remembered any of these books. I'll be reading that one as soon as I can, hopefully to find that the character who shares my name is a good one.	2002-04-14

Abandoned by her mother and considered a freak of nature in her foster homes because of her abilities, she is finally adopted by Circle Daybreak where she grows to become the leader of an elite swat team. Her latest mission is to protect the latest identified Wild Power - a clueless, ditzy blonde whom everyone seems to love and has everything Keller never did. And when for the first time she begins to have feelings for someone, she discovers that their love is not only impossible, but could destroy the world.<br />ILIANA DOMINICK - A descendant of the twin siblings of the Crone of all the Witches; the third discovered Wild Power, and the legendary Witch Child. Needless to say, the big-hearted and immensely popular teenager does not take this too well. Finding out in one day that she is a 'lost witch', has a magical blue fire within her that is required to save the world, and that as the Witch Child she is obligated to marry the heir to the First House of Shapeshifters to form an unbreakable alliance between the two races, she is understandably a little reluctant to furfill her duties.<br />GALEN DRACHE - the sheltered and naieve heir to the Drache Family - the First House of Shapeshifters, who is required to marry the Witch Child, mets Keller when he mistakenly interrupts her mission in an attempt to save her life. Desparate to do some good in his life, he joins her team, only to find himself falling in love with her. But the alliance of the witches and shapeshifters lies with him - without it the divided races are weakened.<br />AZHDEHA - the awakened dragon, buried underground in medieval times, who's causing havoc for Circle Daybreak. As an incredibly powerful shapeshifter, he can take any shape he choses, and the Circle has the near-impossible task of figuring out who he is masquerading as. Keller almost manages to kill him in his weakened state, but having twice as many horns as is usual, he is more powerful than any of them can comprehend.<br />WINFRITH 'WINNIE' ARLIN - the red-haired, sensitive witch member of Keller's team was expecting a bit more from the Witch Child than what she got. She appoints herself as Iliana's mentor anyway, but it will take all her patience to teach the lost witch spells, not to mention tapping into the incredible power of the blue fire in her blood.<br />NISSA JOHNSON - the final member of Keller's team, a beautiful vampire that is not only an excellent driver, but a formidable fighter.<br />JAIME ASTON-HUGHES - Iliana's best friend. Not only is she deaf, but has been targetted for a hit-and-run car accident, organised by a group of shapeshifters.<br />BRETT ASTON-HUGHES - Jaime's obnoxious brother, who Iliana has a crush on, and who is hosting the year's biggest party in Aston-Hughes estate. Going to it would directly jepardise Iliana's safety, but she is determined to go.<br />ANNA AND ALEX DOMINICK - Iliana's mother and baby brother, who have no idea of their family member's true identity. But as 'lost witches' themselves, they are not totally immune to the forces at work around them.<br />EDGITH HARMAN - the Crone of all the Witches, and the head of Circle Daybreak.

US	39424751	RQ8QJ27MDK199	0671014765	974792663	Black Dawn Night World	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Best of the Lot	In my opinion, this is the best book in the Night World series and it's all because of a detailed, layered plot, and Maggie Neely. L.J. Smith finally gives us a heroine who is brave and heroic, but also a *real* person. All her other heroines are grouped into three catagories - the tough girls (Rashel, Jez and Keller) who don't really have much personality and are magically cured of their pessimissim at the end of the books; the wise, docile, tree-hugging girls (Hannah, Mary-Lynette and Thea) who are the standard damsels in distress, and the downright irritating girls (Poppy and Gillian) who flounce around without any idea of what their doing. But Maggie is a successful break-away from these stero-types, simply because she is a mix of all three - she is strong, determined and willing to put up a good fight (thus her nickname Steely Neely), kind and compassionate, as we see when she refuses to abandon 'Cady' but still is realistically unsure and scared when it comes to some of the decisions she has to make. All this makes her a realistic and enjoyable heroine, someone to relate to, as well as someone to admire.<BR>The second thing that makes this the best book is the number of sub-plots and characters that are ultimately all linked. Within the Night World there is a kingdom in the mountains called the Dark Kingdom where Night People reside, served by human slaves, and relatively un-touched by the outside world. They are so un-touched that they are all still living in a castle known as Black Dawn, and have their own monarchy (L.J. obviously wanted to go medievial). But this kingdom is soon to be over-run by many different characters, each with their own adjendas. Delos the Prince, is the second Wild Power, and struggling to know who he can trust, and what he should use his power for. Hunter Redfern has just found the kingdom, and eagar to exercise dominance over his great grandson in a subtle but cruel mind-game. Jeanne McCartney and P.J. Penobscot are two young slaves, desparate to escape captivity, and Aradia, the Maiden of all the Witches is on a diplomatic mission to the kingdom when disaster strikes. Maggie herself, is brought to the kingdom against her will by her brother's girlfriend, Sylvia Weald who claims her brother Miles is dead. Maggie doesn't believe her, and is desparately searching for him, but before she can get far, she is kidnapped by the Night People. All of these plotlines are weaved up, along with the elements of political upheaval in the Night World when the witches leave the Joint Council, a prophesy concerning Maggie as the Deliverer of the slaves, and the impending battle between the forces of good and evil. <BR>Black Dawn leaves the rest of the Night World books in the dust, so make sure you read this one!	2002-04-07

Hannah Snow is a sixteen year old who is finding strange notes to herself, as well as having strange dreams of the apocalypse. To find out what's going on she visits Paul Winfield, a psychiatrist that uses hypnosis to figure out what's going on in her mind. But instead of finding answers, she begins to remember things from her past - things from her past lives that is.<br />We learn of her life as Hana, and of her soulmate, the second vampire ever created - Theorn who needs blood to survive. We revisit the story of the sisters Maya and Hellewise who we first heard of in Enchantress/Spellbinder, and of Maya's obessesion with Theorn. However, these three characters are soon met with diaster - Hana is killed, but because she is an Old Soul, her soul is re-carnated into another body. Throughout the ages Theorn (who re-names himself Thierry Descoudres) and Maya chase after Hannah after each re-birth- Thierry because she is his soulmate, and Maya because she cannot stand to see the two of them happy together.<br />Although it it set mostly in the present day there are several interesting flashbacks, as well as a large reunion from all the soulmates from the previous books. However, there are some pretty big plot-holes, mostly involving Maya. If she was the first vampire you'd think she'd be all-powerful, with a pretty big army behind her, as well as being mentioned a lot more in the previous books, especially since Thierry seems to have the Night World at his fingertips. Also, it seems a little implausible that throughout the centuries Maya manages to kill Hannah so many times without her or Thierry catching on as to what she's doing. And although the chemistry between Thierry and Maya is interesting, Thierry's little speech to her at the end - \\"she'll still be alive, in me\\" -doesn't make that much sense (you'll know what I'm talking about when you read it).<br />There are also some plot lines that weren't really fully explained, such as the voices Hannah heard in her head, her dreams, and how the notes were actually being written - were the messages in her subconscience or was Maya influencing her to write them?<br />If you can ignore the Maya-plot holes and these inconsistencies, then you'll enjoy this book, as it is quite an important one in the Night World series, drawing on more themes than just the usual boy-mets-girl soulmates getting-into-trouble plot.re are also some plot lines that weren't really fully explained, such as the voices Hannah heard in her head, her dreams, and how the notes were actually being written - were the messages in her subconscience or was Maya influencing her to write them?<BR>If you can ignore the Maya-plot holes and these inconsistencies, then you'll enjoy this book, as it is quite an important one in the Night World series, drawing on more themes than just the usual boy-mets-girl soulmates getting-into-trouble plot.	2002-04-07

Somehow the author manages to turn the typical beautiful-and-popular heroine meeting the dark-and-brooding-mysterious-stranger formula into something that wasn't quite as yawn-some as I thought it would be. The reason that this book works better than fellow novels in this genre is it's atmosphere - the craggy and cold coast of Oregon and the ancient forest that borders the small town. The mysteries and legends of the Native American culture is churned in for some extra intrigue. 'The Seduction' is the second part of a trilogy but I've never read the first half and followed along fine, so don't feel that you have to track it down. I learnt the scoop of what happened in the first book pretty quickly and I don't feel as if I missed much.<br />The story itself is of Miranda, the popular young girl who falls in love with Garth - who happens to be under the terrible curse of the werewolf, forced to shapeshift under the light of the full moon, and plauged by strange visions. Miranda vows to unravel the secrets of his past, but evil forces are closing in, and they've targetted Miranda. Now it's up to her whether she wants to resist them, or give in and experience the power of becoming a werewolf herself.	2002-04-06

Gillian Lennox is a bit of a drip who spends her life dreaming about David Blackburn and of being popular when one day she wanders off the road after the sound of a child crying. It is there in the snow that she...well...dies. After a few confusing chapters of tunnels of light, grass meadows and doorways, she somehow manages to find herself back in the snow, shivering and stiff. But there is a difference - she is now accompanied by a strange boy named Angel who only she can hear and sometimes see. The very next day Angel begins whispering to her the 'secrets' of popularity which makes her a shining star in her high school, gaining the attention of her darling David.<br />Here is the first mistake of this novel - it chases after the ever-elusive mystery of popularity. This plot is so over-used that I could have written several chapters myself.<br />Anyway, Gillian laps up the new attention as Angel guides her through the ups and downs of being cool, in some situations that are just not plausible enough to work properly. Eventually, Gillian turns out to be a 'lost witch', one of the grand-children of the twins Elspeth and Emmeth Harman, the siblings of the Crone of all the Witches - Edgith Harman. Angel guides her in the crafting of spells and into the Night World briefly (and I emphasise BRIEFLY) where Ash Redfern makes a cameo appearence.<br />When Angel gradually begins making stranger and stranger requests of her she finally turns to David to help her sort it out.<br />This book simply isn't interesting enough to hold a person's attention for very long, there's barely any Night World and the supernatural elements are based on a life-after-death senario instead of the usual vampires, werewolves, shapeshifters and 'found' witches. Even if it was a novel by itself, it wouldn't of been a very good one. A few chapters are too long and ramble too much, the entire plot has been done before and thus is very predictable, the romance is nothing special, and in the context of the Night World series it sticks out like a sore thumb. There are a few references to books past and present, but on the whole you can easily skip this book and move onto the next, as it doesn't do anything for the steadily growing back-story in the Night World series.much, the entire plot has been done before and thus is very predictable, the romance is nothing special, and in the context of the Night World series it sticks out like a sore thumb.

US	39424751	R1SEBUEHD0ZSDQ	0064472973	930837723	Circle of Three #7: Blue Moon	Books	2	4	5	N	N	A Lesson in Wiccan	The Circle of Three series is about three teenagers - Kate, Cooper and Annie who are practicing the Wiccan religion. The difference in this series (and perhaps the problem) is that each book does not have a beginning, middle and end, but is rather the continuing story of three girl's lives. Reading one out of sequence is confusing as it picks up right where the last one left off, and the events that take place are more like a sequence of events, rather than a structured plot with character building, suspense and a climax. For that reason it is hard to review just one book separately, as each one should be considered as one big novel divided into separate books.<br />However, the books do have their merits - they successfully jump onto the Wiccan/witchcraft/pagan bandwagon that everyone seems to be so obessed with lately, and provides an unbiased and realistic view of this religion as it appears today. Whether you believe in it or not, the books serve to shatter several damaging stero-types.<br />In this case, one of the main heroines, the slightly shy, bookish Annie invokes the goddess Freya to uplift her self-esteem in a ritual known as 'aspecting'. Gaining some of the goddess's characteristics such as confidence and assertion, Annie struts her new life-style, causing minor damage on the way. But it is only minor damage, and when her friends tell her how she's behaving, she reverses the 'spell' and regains her normal personality. See what I mean about no climax?<br />But I'm being unfair, because these books aren't written for riveting reading. They are written for a open-minded, realistic view at the Wiccan religion seen through the eyes of three young people, and in doing that it succeeds.	2002-03-23

However, this does not go down well with her environment at school, and eventually her determination to wear a symbol of her religion leds her into serious trouble. This is a very important book in the series dealing with free-will, religious rights and personal expression, and thankfully the author gives a good account of BOTH sides of the arguement. As much as Wiccans hate it, the pentagram is also a symbol used by Satanists and people will continue to identify the pentagram with them. However, this book helps teach the ignorant that the importance is not the symbol itself, but what it means to the person who is wearing it.<br />Unfortunatly the entire premise is based on the possibility that wearing a pentagram symbol will led to outrage, violence, court-cases, newspaper articles and un-founded prejudice. I won't deny that there is prejudice against all religions in the world, but I found it hard to believe that all the negative events that occured in the book were simply because one high-schooler wore a pentagram necklace.	2002-03-23
