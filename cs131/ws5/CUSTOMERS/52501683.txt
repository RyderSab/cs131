So much that I'm having a hard time believing this is a novel of his.  He was such a master of the game (hint).  Over the years I've enjoyed his novels mainly because of his beautiful writing and portrayal of strong women.  The two women in this novel weren't the least bit interesting.  I never came to care whether or not they made it through their predicament.  I just didn't care.  I'm always willing to suspend my imagination in just about any given situation, but most of the scenarios here were so simplistic and implausible that it was laughable.   So disappointing.  To give this harsh a review isn't easy, but I take my reading serious and usually expect much better from someone who's listed on \\"My Favorite Authors\\" list.  Even if they've been around a long time.	2005-02-16

And having Harry Bosch involved is always a major plus for me.  Bosch has been my favorite fictional character for quite a while now.  This story shows why it's always so enjoyble when he's involved.  His detecting mind is always so entertaining.  I'll admit to being slightly disappointed in the way it ended for Backus, but it was exciting getting there because of Bosch.<br />I'm glad to see him return to the force because that's when he's at his best.  And I'm certainly looking forward to him putting his excellent detecting skills to use again.  <br />This book was very entertaining...great job Mr Connelly.	2004-06-29

Parrish has once again written a great Louis Kincaid mystery/thriller.  I've been hooked on Louis' story from the beginning and just continue to enjoy with each novel.  He's such a fascinating, likable character, whom I enjoy reading about through each adventure.  His relationship with Landetta, while at first was a bit tough going turned out to be something good for both of them.  I certainly hope they come together again in future novels to solve cases.  As for the story of the family on the island, after a while I kind of figured some things out, but not the &quot;why&quot;.  I never saw the &quot;why&quot; coming.  It was so compelling and in many ways sad, but a very interesting plot twist.<br />For me, this isn't the best from P.J. Parrish, but it's definitely a great addition to the Louis Kincaid series.  I look forward to more...hopefully soon.<br />Island of Bones is a winner.	2004-03-19

I love the way he digs in and becomes determined to solve a case. With his caring and determination, you're pulled into his expertise for detecting. I was glued to every page and loved going along as he solved the crimes. His reasoning behind Angella's hands placement confirmed for me that I was settling in for pure reading enjoyment.

Twist and turns always hold my interest if done right and here it definitely was.  All the characters were interesting and made you want to know who and why.  Jack, I love reading about anytime and hope there's more to come from him in the future.  I never did like Jessie, simply because of her cold treatment of Jack.  And the killer(s), scary.

Once again, we get Louis Kincaid at his best.  The story was intriguing and moved at an excellent pace.  I don't recall reading a novel that had so many twist, which is one of the  main reasons it holds your attention.  Louis does an excellent job again and I think PI suits him well.  I just love how his mind works and he puts all the puzzle pieces together.  He may have come to the wrong conclusions at times, but he never stops seeking answers.  I love that about him.  Very sad when you learn Kitty's story, such an innocent.  I really admired Louis' dogged determination to see justice done and allow her to rest in peace.

Not that the story was gripping, but I always enjoy the camaraderie between Angel and friends.  Especially when it's tense and strained as displayed in this novel.	2003-02-23

This novel was so entertaining that I was able to finish in 2 days.  Would have finished sooner, but life interrupted.  Alex Cross and Sampson were superb in this grippng outing.  I would have liked the killers to stand accused, but wasn't disappointed with what happened.  Looking forward to the next installment, and I definitely recommend this one.	2003-01-04

I've read stories with creepier villains, but he was disturbing nonetheless.  Wick, Rennie and Oren were characters that you come to care about and root for.  Wouldn't mind hearing from them in future novels.  Eventhough I've read much better from Ms Brown, I still enjoyed.	2002-11-22

I was prepared to not like this book after reading all the negative reviews, but I'm glad I didn't let that deter me.  This isn't Mr Patterson's best, but still I thought it was pretty good.  The story was, IMO, an attention getter.  Some of the characters were really shallow and not well developed, but I liked the concept of the story.  The pace was good and I really liked the short chapters.  Also, I always enjoy seeing so called untouchables get their comeuppance.  I enjoyed this novel.	2002-10-14

US	52501683	R2XZE4LYA7DG5W	0399148639	786303546	Mortal Prey	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Excellent Police Procedural!	Lucas Davenport at his best, again.  I'm a huge fan of the &quot;prey&quot; series, and this one did not disappoint.  Bringing back Clara Rinker was an excellent idea of Mr Sandford.  I anxiously moved through the pages racing to see what Rinker would do next, and how Lucas and company were going to solve.  I'm almost ashamed to admit that I felt sorry for her, especially with her being a cold-blooded methodical killer.  Regardless of my sorrow, the ending couldn't have gone any other way.  <br />Can't wait to read the next novel featuring Lucas Davenport, especially with him moving in different circles.<br />I recommend this novel, especially to fans of the &quot;prey&quot; series.	2002-08-31

This was an excellent read.  Moved at a steady pace and was so hard to put down.  Very compelling.  The ending kind of slowed down but was no less compelling.  Loved the meaning of the term &quot;law of gravity&quot;.  Very fitting for the villian.  Would definitely love to read another story featuring Phillip Barkley.  He was a very likable character.  I highly recommend this novel.  Can't wait to see what Mr Horn gives us next.	2002-08-22

It was hard to put down because I desperately wanted to see how Troy was going to pay.  I think he deserved worse, but the novel was still satisfying.

I loved the tortured Angel when he tried to keep control of his conscience, defying \\"the hand\\".  Such emotion.  The action was really good, along with some weird yet exciting fighting.  It was hard getting my imagination to conjure up the fighting and the creatures, but I enjoyed nonetheless.  Looking forward to the next novel.	2002-08-11

I've read all of Mr Palmer's medical suspense novels, and eventhough I think he's done better, I still enjoyed.  I thought the ending, while interesting, fell a little flat.  I think I enjoyed the camaraderie between Matt and the Slocumbs almost as much as anything else.  All in all an enjoyable read.	2002-07-29

The story was interesting, but I kept waiting for it to grab me.  It never did.  I lost interest abd only kept reading because I wanted to know who was behind it all.  Must say I was not surprised.  Eventhough I didn't care for this novel as much, I'd still read the next.	2002-07-22

The plight of Gabriel and Jacob was heartwrenching, especially the ending.  It brought me to tears.  You have to totally suspend your imagination.  Which shouldn't be hard if you're already a fan of the T.V. show.  Angel and the gang were fantastic.  I highly recommend this novel.	2002-07-13

I've read all his novels featuring Jack Reacher and continue to be intrigue.  Reacher gets better with every book.  I love reading how his analytical mind works and how his confidence in himself and his cohorts never waivers.  This is one political thriller that holds you and makes you curious to see what comes next.  This book is highly entertaining and is highly recommended.  Loved the suspense.	2002-07-02

The story was interesting, eventhough I thought the character \\"Angel\\" was written a little different than usual.  He was kind of indifferent towards Doyle and Cordelia, close to being rude.  That's not the \\"Angel\\" I've come to know.  Great novel for fans of \\"Doyle\\".  Not the best of the novels I've read so far, but still interesting enough to hold your attention, especially if you're a fan of the TV show.	2002-06-28

This didn't seem like the Jack I've grown to love reading about.

My heart was racing through some of the dialogue.  Web London was the best.  All the supporting characters were so believable, including the bad guys.  This book was hard to put down.  It kept you interested, even though in some cases I thought there was too much detail.  It still didn't detract from the story.  I highly recommend.  Thank you Mr Baldacci for such a compelling read.  Bring on the next (hopefully Wed London) novel.	2001-12-16

I've read all the Jack Reacher novels and they just get better and better.  This story is suspenseful and keeps you guessing.  Reacher is his usual fearless self, someone you definitely want on your side.  I love the way his mine works.  And Mr Child is one heck of a writer.  My heart was racing through some of the scenes, making me feel like I was there.  That's good writing.  I highly recommend this book, and strongly suggest you go back and read the other novels featuring Jack Reacher.  They are all good.  That way you will gain some insight into the person Reacher is.  Sit back and enjoy because you will not want to put this book down.  I can't wait for the next Reacher novel.	2001-06-23

And for years she was one of my favorite authors.  I've never given a novel this unfavorable of a review, and hope to never do this again.	2001-06-12

This is a very good novel, that's sure to tug at your heart.  The characters were well drawn out and the story was told in a way that kept your interest.  It  was hard to put down.  Now I must go back and see what else she has written.  I recommend this book.	2001-06-12

Mr Horn is definitely someone to watch.  I've already added him to my &quot;favorite authors&quot; list.  All the characters were interesting, especially Frank.  He's the type of lawyer you'd want defending you.  The investigating procedures were so enlightening.  I kept wondering how everything was going to turn out and I was not disappointed.  I can't believe some of the negative reviews this novel received.  Mr Horn gave you everything you'd want in a legal procedural and more.  He's an awesome writer.  I hope there are more novels coming featuring Frank O'Conell and company.  But for now, I highly recommend this one.	2001-06-06

It wasn't as gripping as some of his previous novels, but still I enjoyed the story.  Nick was such a likeable guy.  You couldn't help but root for his success.  The deplorable conditions in which the captives were held was unimaginable.  I've read all of Mr Grippando's novels, and have yet to be disappointed.  Recommended reading.	2001-06-03

Thank God I didn't listen.  This was a good book.  Some of the things happening may have been implausible, but who cares when you are being entertained the way Mr Mills did in this novel.  Quinn and Eric were great.  Mr Mills pulls you in and has you caring about them.  Marin was as sadistic as they come.  You just beg for him to have a horrible demise.  Him and all the other supporting disgusting characters.  I am a big Mark Beamon fan, so I would have loved his presence to be more prominent.  Hopefully the next novel WILL feature him.  I wouldn't mine reading more on Quinn and Eric though.  I highly recommend this book.  Take the editorial reviews light and decide for youself.  I really don't think you'll be disappointed.	2001-05-19

I've read every Ben Kincaid and crew novel and they get better everytime.  The courtroom scenes were really good.  Especially Christina.  Ben was his usual brilliant self.  Even though the stroy went in the direction I thought it would I still enjoyed and I definitely recommend.  Keep up the good work Mr Bernhardt, and hurry up with the next Kincaid legal thriller.	2001-05-15

None of the characters were interesting, including the main character.  After Becker, no one compares.  It's hard to believe that after such a long wait, this is what Mr Wiltse gives his fans.  I won't give up though.  I'll see what he does next.  Recommend he bring back Becker.	2001-05-11

Beaumont mystery and feel this is the most disappointing.  &quot;Beau&quot; was his usual likable self but the surrounding characters were lacking.  And the story was just too flat along with the conclusion.  Because Ms Jance is one of my favorite authors, I still look forward to her next &quot;J.P. Beaumont&quot; mystery.  If it comes close to &quot;Breach of Duty&quot;, it should be a winner.	2001-04-15

Has some entertainment value, but I think it could have been better.  It kept my interest, but mainly because I had to see how it would end.  I think his best writing was &quot;Along Came A Spider.&quot;  That said, I'll still read what he brings out next, because most of the time I'm glued to his pages, and he entertains more that he disappoints.  If this is the beginning of a new series featuring &quot;The Murder Club&quot;, it will probably only get better.	2001-04-11
US	52501683	R2JJOLYWN3GA67	0671032992	427650271	Heartbreaker	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Awesome!!!	This is the first time I've read this author because I don't read historical romances.  But once she ventured in to one of my favorite areas, romantic suspense, she hooked me.  She did a wonderful job...this book is really good.  I couldn't stop reading and did not want it to end. I love the bits of humor she interjected now and then.  Her characters were so likable, with the exception of the killer of course.  She did a good job of making him scary.  My favorite was Nick.  You could feel his strength and vulnerability at the same time.   I would love to read a sequel.  Maybe one centered around Noah, and give us an update on veryone from this novel.  I'm sure if you are a fan of Ms Garwood, you will not be disappointed with this novel.  If she continues to write contemporary romantic suspense, she has a fan in me.  I highly recommend &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;.	2001-04-07

I had already figured out one thing about one of the characters, but the revelation of the killer was a surprise to me.  I didn't see that coming.  I thought that was really good.  Overall I enjoyed, which is why I give it 5 stars, but I think Ms Spindler she has written on a more compelling level before now.	2001-03-18

This was in my opinion not a great romantic suspense as stated by yet another reviewer.  Where was the warmth and romance between Michael and Ellie?  The concept was interesting, but the suspense was lacking.  At some points the book did peek my interest only to loose me shortly after.  Overall I was disappointed.	2001-03-11

I've ready all his books and have yet to be disappointed.  I just wish this book had more Bosch in it than McCaleb.  Harry Bosch is one of the best characters of Connelly's novels.  He solves crimes like no other.  I won't give away any of the plot, but I definitely recommend.  Can't wait for his next novel.	2001-03-02

The story concept was good, but the characters were so plastic.  The sex wasn't romantic, just plain sleazy.  And it wasn't hard to figure out what the secret was.  The writing was simply amateurish.  I recommend you read Tami Hoag, Sandra Brown, Nora Roberts, or Karen Robards instead.	2001-02-24
US	52501683	R681D53PXBH6J	0786011890	44207700	Dead of Winter	Books	5	1	3	N	N	A Winner!!	This was an excellent police procedural and an incredible story.  You will be glued to the pages.  The characters were really drawn out.  That Gibralter was, what can I say, beyond words.  To live so nonchalantly after the incident with those kids.  The man was sick.  Jesse was a troubled soul who you couldn't help but feel sorry for.  But no bad deed goes unpunished.  As always, Louis Kincaid was wonderful.  As I mentioned before regarding the other novel featuring Louis, you can't help but get behind him.  I admire his honesty, integrity, sense of honor, and his thought process while trying to solve a case.  I can't wait to see where he ends up next.  Hopefully, his next crime to solve is coming up soon.  There is no doubt in my mine it will be as good as the first two.  I highly recommend &quot;Dead of Winter&quot;.	2001-02-11

The story is so engaging, you can hardly wait to see how it ends.  It ended just right.  Mac is such a likable person, you hope for a good ending for him, in spite of his lapse in judgement.  Two secrets that were revealed I'd already figured out, but it did not deter me in the least.  Get comfortable before you start this book.  It's a good one.  I can't wait for Mr Kaiser's next novel.

This was a really good story, and I think it needs a follow-up featuring these unforgettable characters.  The interaction between Shane and Chooch was heartwarming.  They are what each other need.  And the ending couldn't have been better.  The chemistry between Shane and Alexa wasn't bad either.  The tension mounts which keeps you wondering what's next.  I found it hard to put down.  I can't wait to see how he entertains us next.  Keep up the wonderful writing Mr Cannell.  You do not disappoint.  I definitely recommend this book.  Enjoy!!	2001-01-22

The story was totally compelling.  I loved it.  David Morrell is one of the best authors out there when it comes to non-stop action.  Especially with all his older books.  The ones of today are lacking.  Try this book, especially if you're in to action and a little romance.  You won't be disappointed.	2001-01-16

This was a wonderful book.  I loved every minute of it.  The Stanfield's clan was so twisted.  But it made for exciting reading.  I fell in love with little Rafi.  He was so adorable.  The love between Logan and Kelly was so touching.  Tears streamed down my eyes several times.  Logan really does sound like a man to die for.  The things he went through during his childhood just broke my heart.  I'd love to read more about Logan, Kelly, Pops, and Rafi.  This was my first time reading Meryl Sawyer and now I must read more.  This is one romantic suspense that I highly recommend.  There is absolutely no way you could be disappointed.  Go slow, because you will not want it to end.  Enjoy.	2000-12-01

Out of all 3 books, I think the first was best.  It was good finally getting to know Noah Bishop's story.  I think he was really special.  All the characters were interesting, but I think he was more than others.  The story was a little too drawn out for my taste, but I had to keep reading to see how it would all end.

We should all be so lucky.  I feel the story line could have been more compelling and more convincing especially when it came to Bobby Lee and his mother.

Get comfortable before you start reading  &quot;Storming Heaven&quot;, and be warned, you will not be able to put it  down.  I just loved all the good guys.  They all contributed to a wonderful  story.  Mark Beamon is now another one of my fictional heroes.  I can't  wait to read &quot;Free Fall&quot;.  Keep up the good writing Mr Mills.	2000-04-30

Very suspenseful.  I will have to admit I'd figured out who the killer was.  Once revealed I wish the author had gone back and  showed more people's reactions.  But, I still enjoyed.	2000-04-09

The author captures your attention and never lets go.  The suspense never lets up.  I think suspense readers will definitely love this book.  The tragic incident was  heart wrenching.  And you couldn't help but find yourself getting behind  Louis.  He is a very likable character.  I wish the book could have been  longer.  I will definitely add to my &quot;authors to look for list&quot;.   I can't wait to read the next Louis Kincaid novel.	2000-02-05

US	52501683	R3UPGX6XGMGGFH	0553574965	216306866	The Last Family	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Action, Action, and more Action!	A great debut novel.  It was hard to put dowm.  Mr Miller has written a very entertaining, action-packed, fast-paced, compelling book.  The characters were great, the villain was incredibly scary and believable and  Paul Masterson was great, flaws and all.  I can't wait to read his next  novel.  A sequel would be great.  I highly recommend this book if you like  fast-paced action.  But beware if you're squeamish.	1999-05-23

I love a story of revelations and redemption and this one deals with it well, showcasing the power of love between a father and his son.  This book also shows you that you can right  a good police procedural without a lot of graphic violence and sex.  Great  job Mr Kenney.  I'd love to read more stories involving Jack Devlin.  I  highly recommend this book.	1999-04-12

I just finished reading this book and it was awesome, compelling and suspenseful with just the right amount of non-stop action.  The characters were well drawn out and you start to care for them to the point where it  was so disappointing when they were killed.  What can you say about  Hunter...I liked him and his wolf.  I'd love for Mr Huggins to bring him  back again in another novel.  This was the firt time I read this author so  now I'm going to go back and read his others.  I recommend this book to any  action fan.  I really don't think you'll be disappointed.	1999-04-07

It's been a while since we read the latest on Beau, and it was well worth the wait.  I really enjoyed this book.  I was shocked and saddened with some things.  But still I enjoyed.  I really hope Ms. Jance doesn't take  this long with the next Beaumont installment.  I recommend to all J.P.  Beaumont fans.  I really don't think you'll be disappointed.	1999-02-27

I bought this book today at 10:30a, started reading it around 1:30p and just finished at 8:30p, and would have finished sooner, if not for a few minor interruptions.   This is one of the best romantic suspenses I've ever  read.  So suspenseful, heartwarming and sad at the same time.  This is the  very first time I've read this author and now I'm going to go and find the  one called \\"Sweet Baby\\".  I just passed Reunion to my mom and  couldn't stop telling her how good it was.  Ms Sala goes on my list of  favorite authors.  I can't wait to read her others.  Find this book as soon  as you can and sit back and enjoy a wonderful read. I advise you to clear  your schedule because once you start this book you will not be able to put  it down.	1999-01-31

I've read every one of his books, and he doesn't disappoint.  I recommend his Harry Bosch series to anyone looking for great police procedurals.  I can hardly  wait for the next Bosch story.
