As a mother of a seven-year-old I wanted to find out just what I might not know in the future.<br />I opened the book and fell into the complex life of a young teenager today. Sophie is adorable, she is great and she thinks for herself.<br />What I enjoyed most about this book is that the poems portray Sophie's diversity of relationships with those around her - the relationship with her father, mother, two best friends, boyfriends and even her on-line obsession.<br />My favorite part is the end which I re-read a few times before I sent the book to my best friend.<br />This book did not give me ammunition for the future when my daughters are teenagers. It was even better than that - it took me back in time to when I was young. It was a great read.	2004-01-07

She then paints the picture from that time to 1943. <br />This book actually tells two stories - first the account of Rosetta's life during that period of time and second the historical facts of the time. <BR>The entire book impressed me, but two things about this book absolutely AMAZED me. <br />1. Roessetta Loy's voice. On the first page she is a young girl tended by a nanny, the reader is treated with the perspective of life at this point in time from the unusual view of a curious and intelligent child. As the book progresses and Rossetta ages the story changes in vocabulary and scope. <BR>2. Ms. Loy presents the key points of political and legal changes in her church, city and country with simply clarity. This is the first book that I have read on the subject that didn't attempt go overboard on explanations, excuses or &quot;what ifs&quot;. Ms. Loy states the facts of legal changes and racial politics of Italy at the time without attempting to question `how', `why', `to what end' and `what if'.  Instead the reader will hear these questions echo in their own mind. <br />This is a powerful book. It is written in simple style and easy to read. It could be read in a day or two, but if you are like me when you get to the end you will want to read it again.	2004-01-04

The authors state in their introduction that when they first started posting a 'position a day' on nerve.com they didn't think their readers would try the positions at home. <br />Some of the positions seem to defy the laws of physics, but something about seeing the drawing and reading the funny captions makes you want to believe - it just makes you want to try it anyway ... just to see.... what may happen... because... well you never know. <br />Many of the positions are basic (I mean come on - everyone has done that a few dozen time) others are creative and many are outrageous. <br />You can tell I really like this book because I've read absorbed it enough to recognize there are at least two duplications and a few positions that are variations on the same theme. Still with over 300 to choose from why complain about such a small detail?<br />Pass this book around at a party and you will learn more about your friends than you ever wanted to know. Just today I heard tales of a collapsing bed, escapades on a billiard table and a few people commented that the authors left out water sports and nature trails. <br />This book also comes in a calendar version for 2004. I recommend buying the book version instead so you can refer to it year after year.<br />I love the book. I just received it today and I'm going out tomorrow to buy a great big rocking chair and a bunch of extra pillows.	2003-12-29

In my opinion it is translated well as the words are rich and descriptive and there is a satisfying pace to the story throughout. The introduction itself is nearly as moving as the tale that follows. Sendak's illustrations magically combine reality with imagination and the double page spreads grow out from the page and allow you to fall into them. <BR>The setting and scene changes are enough to tug your emotions. This story's scene sequence is as follows: a quiet country village, a village in panic at the threat of invasion, a child wandering alone in the woods, a child in the comforting care of St. Joseph, back to the village which has now changed.<br />The subject matter is not light in this tale about love and two hearts coming together. A tale like this could not be as well told if one were to attempt to tell it lightly.	2003-12-28

Two of the stories (Mother Holle and The Old Woman who was not afraid) we had heard from other story collections. This collection is interesting because it combines stories from east and west while most collections are from a specific region.<br />I especially like the first story about a midwife, because it portrays the gift patience and understanding of the profession. There is also a story about a lady on the moon, since reading this story we no longer just look for the 'man on the moon' in our moon gazing, my daughters and I look for the `lady on the moon' as well.<br />All in all this is an expensive book for only 8 stories.

I purchased this book when my oldest daughter was only two years old after watching my teenage nieces and nephews struggle with money management. We follow many of the suggestions in this book and my oldest daughter now 7 is able to manage her money and understands the consequences of spending it all at once. She also learned a very important lesson when a clerk tried to talk her into buying more and putting it on lay-a-way. (She had save 70 Euro (like 84 US dollars) for a doll and the clerk suggested putting it on lay-a-way along with the accessories). I forbid it as this went against the whole idea of \\"saving.\\" The next week the store went out of business. If she had caved in to her desires she would no longer have her favorite doll! Also after I purchase her initial school clothes, ballet clothes, winter gear etc... she pays for anything else she desires - so if she climbs trees and gets holes in her tights, looses a glove - she pays to replace them. This has been a great stress relief in our relationship - as this little tomboy likes to dress like a princess and ruin her fancy clothes. Now the ball is in her court and she's handling it well.	2003-12-18

The illustrations are great. Filled with animals and each one has a personality, as does the main character (she becomes more and more frustrated as the story moves along and her home is filled with animals who take over her house). There are so many cute details in the illustrations you children will find more things to discover with many repetitions of the book. You will read this book many times if you own it.

I sought this book for handwork ideas with the items my girls collect on their nature walks. I could not put this book down!<br />Beautiful stuff outlines the projects developed with found materials at the pre-school in Reggio Emilia, Italy. It starts at the beginning with the ideas of the teachers, the method of including parents and increasing children's awareness of everyday objects. (This book is full of details - they mention how the teachers scan materials and remove inappropriate / dangerous materials).<br />The book is filled with photographs from beginning to end. The photographs themselves show the story. I especially like the different approaches to sorting suggested in this book and the amount of time the children were permitting to sort, touch, feel, enjoy, and organize the materials. I also liked the three-dimensional project where the children first drew what they were going to build.<br />The children are quoted throughout the book. The quotes are memorable and sweet and show the children's enjoyment of this entire project.<br />I would recommend this book to pre-school teachers, day care centers, people who baby-sit in their home or parents looking for ideas for found objects. I loved it!	2003-12-12

This book features a detailed introduction including a biography of Chekhov's life filled with some of his memorable quotes. The last section of the book offers a collection of Chekhov's personal letters. I enjoyed these aspects of the book almost as much as the stories, or perhaps I enjoyed them because I so enjoyed the stories. Some may feel that the entire of Chekhov's work cannot be adequately edited due to enormity of the task. In the introduction, the editor has this to say about the task, \\"He was an uneven writer, and many pieces were omitted from the present volume without regret.\\" I couldn't agree more, the stories in this book total 594 pages the letters add nearly 40 more.

I found this book amazing in many ways. First it is a true story covering three generations - three radically different times in Chinese history. Second it is told with a brutal honesty. Most amazing still is Jung Chang's writing style she has the ability to paint a picture describe a scene and you are there. Her words give you enough detail to be in that place and feel the emotions of the situation. You will not get lost in endless descriptions of the background and the weather as in some historical tales. Nor does she delve into a philosophical debates and explanations of political decision making processes at high government levels. (This would have been very tempting to include). There is a great deal of political information in the book. There are details of the political life of Party Members but throughout the book Jun Chang keeps the details wound tightly around the main characters - her grandmother, her mother, her father and herself. Her honest descriptions of the student led cultural revolution are as heartbreaking as they are terrifying. If you have any interest at all in the history of China or of social behavior you will not be disappointed in this book.	2003-12-10

Just one short tale of her life, but it is enough to give you a sense of her home, school, friends and feelings. The rest of the book is primarily set in a new &quot;special economic zone&quot; in the south of china at the time when these zones were newly created. The book focuses on the experiences of young people during this transition period in China. Mian paints a picture of hope and desire stirring within the hearts of her young characters while caution and uncertainty ruled their actions. This is a story about music, self-expression, coming of age and falling in love. <br />Best of all is Main's poetic style. It must be said that Lingenfelter did a wonderful job in the translation, as the prose is sultry and descriptive. Mian does not immediately detail who the speaker is in each section. The story moves from first to third person - from the south back to Shanghai and introduces characters without setting them up. I appreciated this style. To me it reflected the chaotic life of the main characters. If you enjoy detailed explanations of characters and character motivations in a story or prefer that dialogue to be neatly arranged in quotes identifying every speaker you will have a difficult time following this book. However, if you enjoy poetic prose with a few rock-n-roll lyrics thrown in and changing voices filled with description and emotion you will find Candy a memorable read.<br />Mian hints that the book is semi-autobiographical. Readers will wonder which of her characters contain her experiences. Not to worry, she has already expressed her desire to write \\"nakedly\\" of her own life. I'll certainly read it when she does.	2003-12-10

It is the kind of book that grandparents by for their grandchildren with the thought that they are giving a lasting keepsake storybook. <br />Grandparents, parents open the book and read one of the stories, just one before you buy it. <br />In this book Disney took some of its best-loved characters and haphazardly created meaningless Christmas stories for them. None of the authors of these stories are acknowledged and if I helped write them I wouldn't have my name on it either.<BR> <BR>In the first story the 101 Dalmatian puppies get an explanation of Christmas \\"people give gifts to those they love.\\" When the Dalmatian puppies see gifts Christmas morning they exclaim, \\"We are loved.\\" In the Cinderella story she misses the \\"mess\\" of \\"Christmas\\". The plot of Oliver and Company is also focused on shopping and gift giving. <br />These content for all stories feature long sentences and make the mistake of \\"telling\\" instead of \\"showing\\" throughout the entire book. For example, \\"Ariel felt her heart glow with hope\\" and other such nonsense. <br />I read the entire book looking for something positive to say about at least one of the stories. All I can say is that if a fifth grader wrote the stories I would encourage him/her to keep writing and offer praise and gentle guidance. These stories do not have any values that I would want to share with my children and I won't be reading this book to them. <br />If you want to read to your child about \\"giving and receiving\\" I suggest \\"Apple cake\\" or the \\"little house Christmas\\" which is a collection of true Christmas stories from the Little House series.	2003-12-10

I wouldn't recommend you buy this book without reading it first. If you are looking for a book to read to your child, you should consider another book. There are many successful children's stories told in rhyming verse, there are also a few fun mysteries geared to younger children, perhaps there are even other books dealing with mobsters and thieves full of lust and murderess intent aimed at children, but I don't know of any.<br />If you child is curious they will want explanations of the phrases in the book. In this case don't buy this book unless you feel comfortable explaining the following terms and phrases:<BR>\\"a two-bit hood\\", \\"a local thug\\", \\"local fence\\", \\"the underworld\\", or  my favorite \\"dat roach made bug-eyes at my goil, but I dint take him down.\\" <br />I would also hate to have to explain the ending - and still wonder myself it was feminine virtue, self-defense or sexual harassment that led to the \\"case of near insecticide.\\"<br />This mobster tale has a great format with real protruding bug eyes on the front cover that match the illustrations. The illustrations them selves are dark and seedy like the mob bugs they portray. Though the expressions are well done, the scale of bugs to other objects in the story is odd and the color scheme is purple and black and dark green.<br />All that being said the book does get one star for the cool bug eyes and the list of bugs in the back. The book could possibly appeal to an immature twelve-year-old with an interest in poetry. If you already own this book I recommend you cut out the back two pages for reference and donate the book to some organization that sends children books to third would countries. They already think America is a bunch of murdering thieves anyway so it won't effect our reputation. If you don't own this book and you have nothing at all to read to your children I suggest the back of a cereal box or the local bus schedule instead.	2003-12-10

After the first essay I was blown away with the descriptions. McInerney doesn't talk about wine like the rest of them. I thought, &quot;this guy writes so well, this is like reading a novel.&quot; Then referring to the dust jacket again I discovered he um well has experience in that area too. Despite being fun to read, McInerney packs a lot of information into each essay.

It is a portrait of how through the timeline of our lives we want different things. As the boy grows he looses his desire to play (it seems he looses his love for the tree as well)Yet the tree continues to love the boy and continues to provide the boy with what he wants - apples to sell for money - wood to build a home etc.... This story may appeal to many parents, but children will totally miss the point.	2003-12-07

Faced with illness in the orphanage they try to make it out on the streets - it isn't easy each day they are hungry cold tired and afraid. The girls never give up their determination to stay together and remember happy times. They also show the true spirit of Christmas is giving. This story is well written and beautifuly told. It is recommended for children 9 - 12 but my daughter enjoyed having it read to her at age six. I think the story would even appeal to children older than 12.	2003-12-07

The first time we read it we were nearly in tears.<br />In the story the mother has a new baby and sings to him a beautiful song about her love. Then as the child grows during the day he gets into typical mischief in accordance with his age - 2 years old, young boy, teenager. Still, at night while he is sleeping she sings her lovely song.<br />The boy grows like all boys do and moves away. Still the mother loves him (in the book this is demonstrated by her continuing to sing to him at night) - apparently some reviews don't know the meaning of the word \\"metaphor\\". Nonetheless the mother's love is with her son wherever he goes.<br />As time passes the mother grows old and her son demonstrates his love with his version of the same song. <br />The last part of the book is even more touching as it demonstrates how the mother's love of her son is then passed down from him to the next generation.<br />I sing all the verses in this book when I read it to my children. They seem to like this book most between the ages of 2 and 4.  However adults and even teenagers have told me \\"the way you read that makes me want to cry.\\" I assure you it is not my voicing of the words, but the words themselves that are full of emotion.<br />When I give this book to a parent I advise them to \\"sing\\" the parts written as song. I've yet to meet anyone who didn't love this book.	2003-12-07

Dad just can't make up his mind, as more babies are added to the family it is becoming more difficult for him to sleep - he builds the bed bigger and bigger and bigger. The results of having the biggest bed in the world are amusing. Then Dad is hard at work again, bunking the kids in another room only to find it difficult to sleep without them.

It has accompanied me to Asia and Europe. Though my children are typically healthy Avia's advice and recommendations have helped on numerous occasions and two emergency situations. I especially like that each section has advice on \\"when to seek medical care.\\" It is refreshing to read a natural health reference that does not bash the medical model of treatment but instead recognizes the approaches though different can be compatible. I have also applied the advice in this book to adults with good results.	2003-12-07

I immediately registered my complaint with his mother who told me, \\"He couldn't sit still to listen to a book -ever.\\" But then my husband told me of his favorite book \\"where the wild things are\\" a book I didn't know existed. We found a copy of the book and enjoyed it for years before our children were born. This book is a favorite of our children and mine and still remains 'Daddy's favorite book.'	2003-12-07

The book has a lot of action and though some of the concepts are above the age level of the children this book would appeal to (\\"going on strike\\" and \\"duck was a neutral party\\")it does not detract from the story at all. The tension builds in the book as the cows (now joined by the chickens) make their demands and the farmer issues an ultimatum. It gets to a point where readers will wonder if the conflict can be resolved at all. But it is resolved in a very creative way and the surprise ending adds another comic element to the story.	2003-12-07

This story spans four generations as we first meet Alice as a young girl who helps her grandfather. As a girl she proclaims, \\"I too will travel the world and come home to live by the sea.\\" Her grandfather informs her that there is a third thing she must do, \\"something to make the world more beautiful.\\" After a time of being \\"grown up\\" it hits Alice (Miss Rumphius) that she has not yet seen the world and she sets off at once. (I love this part - as that is exactly what happened to me and other 'world travelers' I know). She then returns home to live by the sea and next she must think of a way to make the world more beautiful. The story is narrated by the great-neice of Miss Rumpius so told from a child's perspective. This book has multiple beautiful messages for people of all ages. I have even given copies to freinds who are adults.	2003-12-07

The story is a rhyming verse of a mouse crashing in on a child's birthday party. As the party continues, the mouse moves from room to room. Children enjoy finding the mouse on every page. The mouse is cleaverly hidden and mixed in amongst other \\"mouse like\\" items. This is a fun book to read as well as enjoy the detailed creative photos. A simpler variation of the \\"I Spy Books\\" with a delightful suspensful poem to carry the action along.	2003-12-07

The little old woman has a little cat and a little cow - she also has some milk. This is a story my daughter heard at pre-school.  She loved the story as did her classmates. After reading it to her, I could see why. This tale is easily adapted to puppet show or storytelling with props. I've told it in countless pre-school, early elementary and special education classrooms. I've found that the time provided usually allows me to tell it twice and by the second time, children are speaking the words with me. A very rewarding experience!	2003-12-06

The subtle introduction of days of the week and ascending counting scheme make it a nice choice for pre-school and early grade classrooms. For these reasons and naming of foods make it a perfect book for new ESL students.  Reading this book FEELS GOOD - in typical \\"Carle fashion\\" the pages increase in size as the caterpillar eats more and increases in size.  The ending is a beautiful (and educational) transformation.	2003-12-06

This book is the beautiful story of a dad who goes to all lengths for his daughter - he actually gets the moon for her!<BR>In typical \\"Carle fashion\\" this book expands (as the moon appears to do), the pages ascend ever higher (as the moon ascends in the sky).  As with Carle's other stories you don't just hear them and see them - you FEEL them.  I love the motion in this book. The tenderness of the gift from father to daughter and the representaion of the child's joy in playing with the moon. This story has a wonderful opening, fantastic struggle and beautiful ending. I especially enjoy how the moon itself is a character in the book.	2003-12-06

It carries children away, (my daughter age 1.5 \\"I want to get very very very small and go ride that horsey').  The cadence of the book is soothing and exciting.  I have so much fun reading this book that I usually improvise some jazzy notes after the brass band verse and I always lift my voice in a resounding \\"BOOM\\" durning the last verse. This is not a book about berries - it is a trip into the imagination of a little boy - and what a beautiful journey Bruce Degen has created for us to enjoy.	2003-12-06

After an unfortunate accident, Walter finds himself on the wrong side of his Duke and is faced with possible banishment! Walter uses all his talents in the kitchen and with a bit of good fortune he is able to satisfy the Duke's challenge and create a new treat for the entire world to enjoy. We received this book as a gift before moving to Germany. My children were 1 and 5 at the time and both loved it. Even my restless one year old could sit though the whole story. Collage pictures (a Carle trademark) are more detailed in this book than in Carle's more elementary stories. Here we have background - a kingdom, people standing in line outside the bakery, a large group of horses and dogs in a scene. The pictures alone entertained my girls for hours as they choose their favorite horse, dog and pretzel in the pictures and made up their own stories of the other characters pictured. This is a great book for anyone who likes a make believe tale of how things could have been invented. It is a nice story about working hard to solve a problem even when it is seems \\"unfair\\". It is a great book for reading in Germany with bakeries on every corner and so many pretzels to choose from!	2003-12-06

The character of the mouse is depicted so very well in the drawings - though afraid of the big hungry bear he shows us he is a clever little mouse.<BR>I love all of Don and Audrey Woods books -this is one of my favorites.  I like the large hardcover edition best - the pictures are big enough for little ones and their parents to become happily lost within.	2003-12-06

The drawings portray the seasons and the personalities of the characters pictured - down to the very last little plant. This is a perfect book for education - seasons, months, weather for younger children and flower naming, words and prose for older children. This book is a collection of poems, not a story book.

Pelle helps his grandmothers, his neighbor, his mother and the tailor.  With their assitance and some work of his own Pelle is the proud owner of a new suit. This is a beautiful story of cooperation set in a time and place when such tasks as sheering your sheep and rowing your boat to shore for supplies are commonplace.

Children will especially enjoy the 'stories within the story' as part of the festival is a storytelling contest. The illustrations in this book are beyond compare. Elsa Beskow has an amazing ability to bring out the personality of the flowers and plants in her drawings and words. An impatient two year old may not be able to sit queitly on your lap for this long tale, but just hearing this story read to older children while palying in the same room, has a calming effect on my \\"spirited\\" two-year-old. This book has a place on the top shelf of the children's book section in our home - next to other treasures and in sight, but out of reach of little hands.	2003-12-06
