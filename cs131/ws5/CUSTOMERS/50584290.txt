The only thing better than reading this book is listening to it on CD as Sedaris himself reads from the pages. His comical high pitched voice and impeccable sense of comedic timing works on so many levels, you gotta hear him deliver the lines himself. I would give the audio version 5 stars because it is funnier to hear it rather than read it but still this book delivers! Read it and laugh (...)!	2004-09-17

I read this book on a short plane ride.My husband had received it at his job like so many others had. It took me about an hour to read, only because I had trouble staying awake. Maybe I missed something but if anyone thought this book was innovative or unique in any way then they just don't read a lot. Two words I would use to describe this book would be trite and boring. Did anyone learn anything from this book that has not been told and said over and over again at least a million times before, and in a more engaging and thoughtful way? Not likely. Still after I saw the success this book had (weeks on the bestseller list, go figure) it made me wish I had written the book since by now I could have been happily retired in Hawaii somewhere.	2004-08-28

This follow up doesn't quite live up to the original but it is interesting to see where the first book left off and what happened the year after the year by the sea. I recently met Joan Anderson at one of her wonderful weekend by the sea retreats and she told us that she had been asked why she and her husband got back together after a year apart, and she said it is because he is my best friend. As simple as that. This book does show the love and tenderness that Joan and Robin have for each other especially after Joan breaks her ankle and has to completely depend on her husband for everything. After an awkward start, he becomes an expert in domestic duties much to Joan's delight. Who knew? Given half a chance, men can take care of a household as well as a woman if he is willing to try. And their two weeks at the dune cottage while their house was being renovated was a kind of a whimsical adventure. With no electricity, running water or telephones what can you possible have to do for two whole weeks? Well, they managed to do a lot of discovery about themselves and their surroundings during that time. Everyone should have such an opportunity to get away from the rat race once in a while. I recommend the book but only after reading A Year by the Sea first if you haven't already because otherwise you won't get it.	2002-06-17

I am not a Left Behind junkie like so many others have become. In fact, I have only recently read the first book. What are there like 9 or 10 more of these to go? I am not sure I want to invest my time reading all those books when there are so many better written novels out there to be read. I gave this book 3 stars because I do have to commend the authors for the clever way they used the Book of Revelations to make a sort of entertaining novel, kind of a combination sci-fi and suspense novel. I hope no one is reading these books to get a religious lesson because these books are pure fabrication, a kind of what if this were to happen. Again, I do not think the language of the book was particularly good, but the idea itself is interesting. Maybe they should consider getting a ghost writer for the new books. I am not sure what the author's intentions are here. Perhaps it is to get the message out to the masses of people that have not read the Bible but to me this is a fictional novel and a mediocre one at best.	2002-03-27

I still have a lot of unresolved issues surrounding my father's death and it has impacted me in a very negative way. I thought this book would provide me some insight into why I am still having problems with my dad's death. I related to some of the book, but not all of it. The author's circumstances were very different from mine but she does include interviews with many other women, some of whom I could relate to and some that I couldn't. I am not really sure if it has given me the additional insight I had hoped for but it a well researched and well written book and is worth reading. It seemed more of a personal journal of the author's life and her father's death rather than a psychological study of how our fathers' death affects us, but I am glad I read it anyway.	2002-01-18
US	50584290	R11P2O1CWMKUUN	0312195516	226874686	The Red Tent	Books	4	4	6	N	Y	An unusual read	This novel is based on the story of Jacob in the Bible, but it is written from a woman's point of view. The story is told by Dinah, daughter of Jacob and his four wives. The Red Tent is where the women go when having their periods or giving birth, so five days out of the month they are in the tent. Not a bad idea if you get bad PMS! Maybe we should bring it back!<br />Anyway, if you are not familiar with the Old Testament of the Bible, you may want to read the story of Jacob first before you read this novel as it will help to make more sense to you. If you are familiar with the Old testament, you will probably enjoy the story more than your typical religious lesson would allow. It is a good way to learn more about the Bible if you find reading the Bible too dry. The author tends to personalize the characters very well which makes them easier to identify with--she makes them more human and realistic. I enjoyed this book!	2001-12-05

There are two things I like about this book; one, the title is terrific if not realistic for most of us; and two, this book gives many alternative exercises for weight machines so you don't have to go into the weight room if you feel funny about it.<br />You will not get big bulky muscles if you follow this workout because you do not use very heavy weights. Instead you will get leaned, toned muscles which is what most women want and it targets the trouble zones, the abs, butt, and thighs. He also talks about the importance of diet (not dieting) and consistancy (it doesn't happen overnight, you have to keep at it).<br />My biggest criticism of this book is that he does not include exercises for the upper body, though he does mention that it is important to work the upper body as well as the lower body. Therefore, I find it to be incomplete for an overall training manual, but I do think it is a good place to start. Just don't forget to work your upper body every other day as well.	2001-10-17

The story begins when Nathan Price, a missionary, drags his wife and four daughters to the Belgian Congo in order to &quot;save&quot; the natives from eternal damnation by baptizing them in the river. The problem is, they do not want to be saved and even fear the river due to the crocodile situation. Meanwhile, the story is narrated by five different characters, the wife and each of her four daughters. The amazing thing about the book is that it works at all. You would think it would be tough to follow and confusing since it involves five different points of view, but Ms. Kingsolver pulls it off beautifully. The story flows almost effortlessly from one character to another without a break in the telling of the plot. She always seems to choose the right words to make the story work.<br />I also must praise the research done on this novel in order to get the historical facts about the history of the Congo so right on the money. This is like a history lesson on the Congo except it is not revisionist history. It tells the truth and it is not always so flattering to the US. This novel took a lot of courage to write and publish, thanks to the First Amendment.	2001-10-13

I was really looking forward to reading this book for my monthy book club discussion and I was not disappointed. This book has had a profound influence on me. There are so many issues which the author addresses in this book that I could relate to in many ways. Many of her life's events mirror my own. There are many times I said to myself while reading this book that I could have written the passage I had just read and I wished that I had. This book really spoke to me. It finally acknowledges the fact that woman suffer through mid life crisis as well as men and it is not just hormonal! The journey that Joan Anderson made to find herself again is one that I won't soon forget!<br />In the back of the book, there are discussion questions for use with book groups. I found these to be especially helpful in formulating answers to discussion groups questions when the book was discussed.	2001-07-09

I have done my share of dieting and weight loss plans, Weight Watchers, shakes, calorie counting,deal a meal etc. but this is the easiest plan I ever followed. It is all spelled out for you, all the grams are calculated for you so you don't have to be a math major to figure out what to eat. The food is good and the preparation is not so hard if you do the shopping and plan each day's meals ahead of time. And you can eat out, they give you a list of fast foods that you can have and there are a lot of them to pick from so you are not deprived. They also give you a list of prepackaged meals that you can have which are for the microwave if you are in a hurry to eat. The only big thing is you have to buy whey protein powder which is pure protein, but they even give you a phone number of where you can order it if you can't find it. So everything is covered for you. No excuses! I just started the program a few weeks ago and I quickly lost 5 pounds and my body fat is reducing already because people have noticed the difference. The best thing about this plan is that I know I can stay on this for the rest of my life. No more yo-yo dieting. What a relief!	2001-06-21

The characters were interesting and the plot was cleverly interwoven to include all the main characters eventually but the book just kind of ends, leaving me hanging and wanting more. I guess it is a sign that a book is good if you want to read more, but it tends to leave me feeling unsatisfied. Was the author intending to write a sequel to this book because he certainly left a lot of questions unanswered. Maybe that was his intention but I always say if you got a story to tell, finish what you start and don't leave so many things dangling. I would still recommend this book but I wish the author would write another book to tie up the loose ends.	2001-06-21

Do you feel like you have it all together when suddenly you begin to sabotage yourself all over again? Do you lose and gain back the same 5 pounds over and over again? If this sounds like you, then Fattitudes may be the one diet book you need to read. Let's face it, there are literally hundreds of diet programs and books out there and most of them are effective IF you follow them. But for so many of us, dieting just doesn't work because we learn to defeat ourselves over and over again. Fattitudes doesn't tell you what to eat and how much. Instead it tells you to think about why we eat and to examine the reasons we overeat and defeat ourselves again and again. There are many exercises to do in the book, and all are thought provoking and beneficial. Before you change your body, you have to change your mind first. So I would recommend that before you buy any new diet book, Atkins, Body for Life, Sugar Busters, the Zone whichever you choose, buy this one first because it will help you to succeed.	2001-06-21

In the tradition of 1984 and Farenheit 451, it bring about the horrors of what could happen in the future if we allow it to happen. Mankind's seeming inability not to mess around with Mother Nature is always getting us into trouble. It is particularly unsettling that the advent of cloning is now upon us, ways of us genetically altering DNA and affecting the way cells are grown in the lab. I hope every scientist who works in these cloning labs has read this book, because it would scare the pants of them, or it should. It is interesting to note that this book was written in the 1930's, way before anyone had heard of genetically altering cells or cloning. Obviously, Mr. Huxley, the author, was a true visionary who saw the possibilities of what could happen long before most other people did. Highly recommended!	2001-06-21

If I could, I would give this 10 stars! This book has single-handedly opened my eyes to what has been holding me back for so many years. If my life has not been a success (according to me, that is) it is because I do not really believe that I deserve to be a success. It is my &quot;shadow beliefs&quot; that prevent me from achieving the type of life that I (and everyone else) deserves to have. The author explains her concepts in a very forthright and understandable manner, using concrete examples from her own life and other people's lives. Then after each chapter, she gives the reader an exercise so they can put the concepts into practice. That is what bothers me about many self-help books. They explain the concepts, but do not give you any concrete way of putting them into practice. What good are the concepts to you if you don't know how to use them in your everyday life? Ms. Ford not only tells you the concepts, but she also tells you how to use them in your own life. I had many &quot;lightbulb&quot; moments while reading this book, and one example actually made me sob because it hit so close to home. I heartily recommend this book if you want to discover how your shadow beliefs have been holding you back.	2001-01-09

I am intrigied by the idea that  someone can totally lie about her past, completely change her identity,  leave her first husband, marry a great guy, have three pretty good kids,  almost have an affair with a murderer and get off totally scott free, with  no retribution to pay. Her husband gives her a hard time for a while and  even throws a tomato at her (though he misses her on purpose), but in the  end he forgives her. Even her mother forgives her for leaving her first  husband and disappering for 2 years.  Doesn't she have any guilt or regret  for all her deceit?  She had hardly done one honest thing in her life. Why  doesn't she have to pay a price for that? The only thing she was ever  honest about is that she prefers animals to most people. She is obviously  more comfortable with animals because she doesn't need to lie to  them.<br />One thing I really did like about this book is the interview with  the author and the discussion questions in the back  of the book.  I enjoy  learning what the author had in mind when they write a book. This helped to  clarify a few details for me. Otherwise, I thought the ending was just a  little too neat and tidy for me. She should have to suffered a little bit  more for her dishonesty.	2000-08-06

I found this  information very useful and wondered why he did not include this in his  book.  If he had included this in his book, I would have given it 5 stars  instead of 4.

I have read many books on how the human spirit can travel toward the road to enlightenment e.g. the Seat of the Soul, The Art of Happiness, Soul Stories etc. and they all have something   positive to offer.  However, one  of my criteria for rating these types of books is how can we utilize this  information in our daily lives.  I don't think most of us will be giving up  our house, our cars, our tv's and cell phones to go off and live on a  mountain in Tibet any time soon, so the question is how can we apply these  Four Agreements into our daily routines?  That's the tough part!  While in  theory the  Four Agreements are beneficial ways to live our lives, can they  be put into practice?  I'm not sure that the author Miguel Ruiz cited many  of examples of how to put these agreements into practice, he kind of leaves  that up to you to decide how to do that.  Also some of his ideas are a  little &quot;out there&quot;, for example, he refers to life as a  &quot;dream&quot; and postulates that we all make our own dreams, therefore  our reality only exists in our own minds. I'm not sure Einstein would  entirerly agree with that theory, but there you are.  I liked the book  because the theories are interesting and uplifting, but can these  agreements really be used in our everyday lives?  That is the question that  Ruiz does not seem to answer in this book.	2000-07-24

Even  so, I learned a lot by reading this book. I learned how simple people, both  men and women of all races,creeds and colors were able to band together  when our country needed it the most. Will this ever happen again? Maybe not  in our lifetime, but it may happen in the future. After you are done  reading this book, save it for your children to read.

For those who have read Gary's other book &quot;The Seat of the Soul&quot; and found it to be a little hard to comprehend, &quot;Soul  Stories&quot; has taken all of the most complex concepts of that book and  just makes them so much easier to understand.  If you haven't read the Seat  of the Soul yet, this might be a good place for you to start to get a  foundation in Zukav's concepts, but the great thing about this book is that  it is so readable and yet stands on its own as an explanation of the  concepts of the soul and the universe.

The most amazing thing about it is that a thirty something year old mother of two i.e. the author Tawni O'Dell can write such a convincing story whose protagonist is a 20 year old man who is taking care of his 3 sisters and faces the usual trials and tribulations of  growing up male. She was right on in her character development. There goes  the theory that you can only write about what you know.  A good author  should be a magician with words and be able to succeed in transporting the  reader along with the story. I think Ms. O'Dell succeeded in doing that  very well here. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that right  from the beginning of the book, I was waiting for something to happen, but  it seemed to take a bit too long for the big payoff to occur. A few of the  parts in the middle dragged a bit for me, but the conclusion was  satisfying.	2000-05-09

The dialogue was forced and contrived to say the least. If you were to compare it to the beautiful language contained in the Bible or other great pieces of  literature, then this book falls way short of being a masterwork.  Having  said this however, I must say that I happen to agree with a lot of the  messages contained in the book. Religion has become too structured and free  will seems not to be stressed as much as dogmatic teachings in most  organized religions.  Many religious leaders seem to have somehow lost the  true message of Christ and seem to be more concerned with what ends up in  the collection plate at Sunday Mass,at least in my experience.  While I did  enjoy many of the messages contained in the book, I just feel it was too  simplistic to be a truly effective book.	2000-04-13

No neat and tidy answers, just like real life.  Eliza was no longer  the same person that had pursued her lover so many years before, and her  response at the end was her way of discarding her past, and moving on with  her new life, whatever that may be.  While most people like to have a  resolution at the end of a book, it is not always necessary for me to enjoy  a book, if it is well written.  I did think this book tended to drag a bit  in the middle, when she was following her lover to San Francisco, but  Eliza's relationship with Tao Chien saved the book for me. Just don't  expect too much in the way of a resolution at the end.	2000-04-01

If you want to find out about Buddism then  of course you should go right to the source, the Dalai Lama.  Dr. Cutler  did that and has been able to organize some rather complex concepts into a  very readable style that could be understood by anyone.  In addition, I  feel that this book will stimulate further interest in Buddist teachings. I  know that I for one intend to read more books on Buddism and try to learn  even more about it based on the fact that the book sparked my interest to  learn more.  Dr. Cutler effectively used examples from everyday life in  order to better illustrate how the Dalai Lama's teaching can be turned into  practical guides to handle everyday problems.

Ellen seems to be the main  character, and yet the author keeps switching the point of view from the  husband to the mother-in-law to the daughter and even to the aunt, Salome.   What the author didn't tell us and I was dying to know by the end was why  the father-in-law was such a beast, and more importantly why everyone kept  putting up with him.  This story took place in the 1970's not the 1870's.   The best part of the story was when Ellen turned the hose on her  weak-minded husband.  All I could think of was what took her so long?	2000-02-07

But, I recently reread this book some 25 years after high school and I'm sorry but the  language is a little bit out of date.  Wouldn't it be great if  Salinger  came out of retirement and rewrote this book to today's language standards?   It is still the best novel around about the alienation of America's youth  (and boy are they ever alienated now more than ever) so it is still a  worthwhile read if you can get past the archaic language. Come back J.D. we  need you more than ever!	2000-02-04

Most people don't even want to think about it at all.  Yet it is going to happen to all of us someday.  The key is can we make our death  meaningful to those who love us and care for us?  Well, Morrie managed to  do that for Mitch Albom and in the process Mitch has given us this  wonderful gift of a book.  I found it to be inspirational and gut-renching  at the same time which is rare indeed. Please read this book if you have  forgotten how to &quot;stop and smell the roses&quot;.  It is the little  things in life that truly are the most valuable, like love, laughter and  good health.	2000-02-04

Almost every single day I randomly flip to another page and read its message.  I am amazed to find how many times I end up flipping to the same page!  I am convinced that  this book is helping me to face life's issues every time I look at it.  I  was meant to see and learn from these messages.  A very inspirational book!  Also I like the format of the book because you can stand the book up and  read its message whenever you feel the need.	2000-01-26

However, I wish the author had revealed a little more about her personal life e.g. why did she try to kill herself  and what was her homelife like?  If you are going to tell your own story I  think you owe the reader all the facts that are necessary to get your point  across. Otherwise, it was an enjoyable book.	2000-01-11

It is not about religion, it is about the spirituality that we all posess in whatever form we choose to express it. A person can take many things from this book  if he or she is willing to open his or her mind to the richness of the  message presented here.  The most important lesson I learned from this book  is that it helped me deal with my father's death, something that I was  having trouble doing before I read this book.  I am at peace now because by  reading Mr. Zukav's book, I understand what it means to have a universal  soul, and that my father is not really dead but is part of the universal  life force that exists in all of us.  It has also helped me to recognize  and deal with my food addiction, which I realize now is due to my desire to  obtain external power.  If you want to find out what external power is, and  how the desire for it fuels our addictions then please read this book!  The  Seat of the Soul is like an owners manual for life.	2000-01-09
