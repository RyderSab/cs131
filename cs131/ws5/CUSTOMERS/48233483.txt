There are many great things I could say about this book, but what amazes me the most about \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is that it's a work of fiction. Arthur Golden does a marvelous job of transporting the reader to 1920s Japan, where a young girl is sold to an okiya and overcomes numerous struggles to become one of the most prestigious geishas in all of Gion. We witness how young Chiyo transforms into Sayuri despite the greedy owners of her okiya and the antics of Hatsumomo, a sadistic geisha who does everything in her power to prevent Sayuri's success. \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is also a love story of sorts: Chiyo's chance meeting with the Chairman when she is a young girl is an event that shapes her destiny. However, as Mameha says in the novel, women become geishas because they have no choice, and they are forced to make massive sacrifices because of it.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book. Parts of the story are heartbreaking, but Golden throws some great humorous bits into the mix for the reader's enjoyment. This is a novel that I couldn't put down: I stayed up until after 3 a.m. because I HAD to finish it before going to bed! Everyone should make sure to read \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" before the much anticipated film adaptation is released this winter...I can't wait!	2005-10-12

I finally read the book and I thought it was even better than the film.<br /><br />\\"White Oleander\\" is narrated by Astrid Magnussen, a teenage girl whose mother, Ingrid, is an uncompromising poet who allows her own selfish desires to dictate the life she builds for herself and her daughter. Astrid is used to her mother's cynical view of the world, but everything changes when Ingrid is arrested and charged with the murder of her ex-boyfriend. When her mother is sent to prison, Astrid moves into the first of a string of foster homes and encounters every kind of foster hell imaginable. At the age of 14, she begins an affair with her first foster mother's boyfriend, only to end up getting shot when crazy Starr finds out what's been going on. Astrid's second foster mother, Marvel, considers foster children to be full-time babysitters and slaves, and she ends up kicking Astrid out when she learns of her friendship with an African American prostitute who lives next door. Finally, Astrid is placed in the home of Claire and Ron Richards, where she finds the kind of unconditional love and acceptance that she's been missing out on her whole life. Nothing good in this novel lasts for very long, though, and eventually tragedy befalls the Richards household, leaving Astrid to continue her journey and move on to yet another nightmarish foster home.<br /><br />Over the course of the novel, Astrid transforms from an innocent girl who was captivated by her mother's wily enchantments to an incredibly sharp, self-sufficient young woman who ultimately manages to gain the upper hand in this complex mother-daughter relationship. Ingrid still manages to control her daughter from behind prison walls, but Astrid emerges from her ordeal with an incredible strength that cannot be penetrated, even by her mother.<br /><br />This is a very intense story, and although the movie adaptation is fabulous, the book is even better. There is much more detail in Janet Fitch's novel: more foster homes, more characters, and more pain. The end of the book differs from the movie slightly, and I like the way the book wraps things up. (Why on earth didn't the movie end the same way?!)<br /><br />I can't say that \\"White Oleander\\" is a pleasant read, because the content is unbelievable depressing. However, it's an amazing story of struggle and survival, and this book should be on everyone's must-read list.ook is even better.

Vlad the Impaler. Everyone knows that Vlad Tepes was an actual historical figure, but the idea that he was a vampire was just a notion that Bram Stoker made up in order to write an entertaining novel...or is it?<br /><br />\\"The Historian\\" begins in 1972, when a young girl finds a mysterious book in her father's library. When confronted by his daughter, Paul reluctantly tells her about the mysterious disappearance of his graduate school mentor, Professor Rossi, over 20 years ago, which occurred moments after Rossi revealed to Paul that Dracula/Vlad was still very much alive. Together with fellow graduate student Helen (who turns out to be Professor Rossi's long lost daughter), Paul sets out on a quest in search of his missing friend and encounters numerous dangers along the way. But before Paul is able to finish telling his story, he suddenly disappears himself, leaving his daughter to sort out the mystery of his disappearance (which also happens to concern her dead mother).<br /><br />The novel constantly jumps back and forth in time, so there are several stories you have to keep straight. However, Elizabeth Kostova does an excellent job of seamlessly transitioning between one sequence of events to the other, so there is no confusion for the reader. \\"The Historian\\" instantly draws you in with its rich characters, deep historical ties, and tales of horror that are so terrifying they would make Bram Stoker shudder. I haven't read a novel this scary since I first read \\"Dracula\\" many years ago. (I can't wait until they make this into a movie...people will be screaming in the theatres!)<br /><br />The only complaints I have about the book are that certain things were kind of predictable...obviously, Kostova was inspired by Stoker's novel, but I also detected certain formulaic aspects of Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I thought the novel could have been a bit more original in places. Also, I felt that I was cheated out of a decent ending. A good portion of the book is spent building up to the ultimate confrontation that occurs at the end of the novel, and that climax was only a few pages long. I also wasn't satisfied with the way Helen suddenly materializes at the end of the story...once again, I think the problem is that Kostova didn't devote enough time to that aspect of the story. Finally, I would have enjoyed reading more about what happened AFTER the climax...how did this family move on after everything that had happened to them? Kostova sums up everyone's fate in a couple of paragraphs, which left me craving for more. This book is almost 650 pages long, and I loved every word of it...I could have easily hung on for a few more chapters! Did the narrator and Barley hook up at the end? What happened after the final book was found by the narrator? I guess we'll never know.<br /><br />In spite of the slight disappointments at the end of the book, I have to give \\"The Historian\\" five stars because it is one of the best books I've read in a long time and the best horror story to come along in years. Anyone who has an interest in Dracula and/or enjoys history will love this book (but beware...it will give you nightmares!).ted certain formulaic aspects of Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I thought the novel could have been a bit more original in places.

Mike and Corinne Mulvaney are an attractive couple with four wonderful children: athletic Mike Jr., brainy Patrick, popular Marianne, and baby brother Judd. This is the kind of family that everyone dreams of: fun, quirky, and full of love. But in typical Joyce Carol Oates style, their idyllic world doesn't last forever. When something tragic happens to 17-year-old Marianne on the night of the Valentine's Day prom, the Mulvaney's perfect world is shattered. The family members who have always been there to rely on each other are each affected by the tragedy. Once respected and admired by the entire town, the Mulvaneys are now ostracized at every turn. In an attempt to deal with the problem, the parents who once seemed so flawless do the unthinkable and send their tormented daughter into exile, an event which sets up the tragic downfall of a business, a marriage, and an entire family.<br /><br />\\"We Were the Mulvaneys\\" is an incredibly powerful novel that tackles issues of family, society, and compassion. Readers will fall in love with the Mulvaneys and then be heartbroken by the tragedy that befalls them. I recommend this book to everyone.	2005-09-04
US	48233483	R23JDSZASE0FGA	0312422156	298109609	Middlesex: A Novel	Books	5	3	4	N	Y	A tactful take on a taboo topic	\\"Middlesex\\" is a story about a young girl who evolves into a man. Calliope Stephanides (also known as \\"Cal\\") always knew that there was something different about her: when all her friends were experiencing the various stages of puberty and growing up, Calliope was struggling with the feelings she developed for her female classmates. It isn't until she is well into her teen years that Calliope finally discovers the truth about herself: she is a hermaphrodite, and although she has been raised as a girl, the masculine tendencies she has been experiencing are a result of physical and hormonal imbalances in her body that cause her to identify with being a male.<br /><br />Jeffrey Eugenides does an amazing job of tracing Calliope's history back to her grandparents, Desdemona and Lefty Stephanides, who immigrated from Greece and spent most of their lives keeping a major secret: they are actually brother and sister. Eugenides also manages to successfully weave historical events, such Prohibition and the race riots of 1967, into the story. Cal is a very likeable and entertaining reader, and the novel explores the subjects of incest, sex, class, family, and gender with intelligence, sensitivity, and wit.<br /><br />Overall I found \\"Middlesex\\" to be quite entertaining and enjoyable (unlike \\"The Virgin Suicides,\\" which I thought was very disappointing).	2005-09-01

Dinah is Jacob's only daughter, and the reader is treated to fascinating stories about Jacob's four wives: Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah. Anita Diamant does an amazing job or portraying what life was like for women in this biblical society.<br /><br />When Dinah comes of age, she is finally able to enter the \\"red tent,\\" which is the place women gather during their menstrual cycles, childbirth, and illness. Her four mother-aunts initiate her into her new life as a woman in the tribe. Eventually Dinah finds true love which ultimately results in unspeakable tragedy, and she is ripped away from the only home she's ever known and is forced to begin a new life in a foreign land.<br /><br />This book gives us an amazing account of what it was like to be a woman during this point in history. You needn't be familiar with biblical teachings in order to enjoy \\"The Red Tent,\\" but as someone who was brought up in the Lutheran church, I find it especially fascinating.

US	48233483	R2EDK05VKX94S8	0385491050	235045723	Surfacing	Books	4	4	6	N	Y	"A divorce is like an amputation, you survive but there's less of you."	One of Margaret Atwood's earlier novels, \\"Surfacing\\" tells the story of a young artist who sets out to investigate the disappearance of her father. Accompanied by her lover and another young couple, she journeys to an outlying Canadian island in search of answers. As the group adjusts to life in the rustic cabin that was once the narrator's childhood home, plenty of sexual tension begins to erupt. The narrator contemplates the fate of her relationship with Joe, who wants more from her than she is willing and able to give. Anna and David's seemingly perfect marriage begins to unravel as the truth about their relationship becomes shockingly clear.<br /><br />The strain among these four people coupled with the unanswered questions about the narrator's missing father creates a lingering sense of foreboding. \\"Surfacing\\" is symbolic and slightly obscure, and it will leave the reader contemplating elements of feminism, nationalism, and general paranoia. I found it a bit difficult to connect with the characters since they're so distant (we don't even find out the narrator's name), but the story is interesting and there is plenty of absorbing subtext to keep the reader engaged.<br /><br />I didn't enjoy \\"Surfacing\\" as much as some of Atwood's other books, but it's a very compelling story...I definitely recommend it.	2005-07-31

Let's begin at the beginning, shall we? \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" opens with an amusing scene with the \\"Other Minister,\\" who is actually the Prime Minister of England, being visited by the new Minister of Magic. I just pictured Tony Blair the entire time, especially when he was lamenting over an impending phone call from that \\"wretched\\" man who was the president of a powerful yet unnamed country...J.K. Rowling certainly has a sense of humor!<br /><br />Let's get back to the main story. Lord Voldemort's followers are gaining power, and people everywhere (wizards and Muggles alike) are in danger. In order to help Harry learn as much as possible about the history of the Dark Lord, Professor Dumbledore enlists in the help of his pensieve to take Harry back in time to the days when Tom Riddle was just a young man. Harry eventually embarks on a journey to help his professor find four missing Horcruxes, which are magical objects in which He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has extracted parts of his soul in order to secure immortality.<br /><br />There are many additional developments in this novel, too. The sixth-year students all receive the results of their O.W.L.S. over the summer, and they become more focused on the intensive classes that will prepare them for their N.E.W.T. exams the following year. Harry comes across a mysterious potions textbook that is marked as the property of the Half-Blood Prince. The book contains a bunch of shortcuts that make potion-making a breeze for Harry, but the identity of its previous owner remains a mystery, and Harry eventually gets more than he bargained for when one of the Prince's spells goes awry.<br /><br />Hogwarts students receive a new Potions instructor when Professor Snape takes over as the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...a move that has Harry and his best friends, Ron and Hermione, absolutely befuddled. Draco Malfoy, Harry's nemesis, has been acting very strange all year. Harry believes that Draco has joined legions with the Death Eaters and is planning some sort of attack on the school, but there's no real evidence to support that theory, and Harry has a hard time getting anyone to believe him. There is also romance in the air at Hogwarts...love potions become very popular, and new couples are formed, some of which are better pairings than others. Harry finally chooses the girl that he was meant to be with from day one, but Ron makes an arse out of himself for the majority of the book, which is painful but also quite humorous (I know he'll set things right in Book Seven!).<br /><br />The novel becomes darker and more somber as it progresses. There are many more deaths in \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" than any of the previous Potter novels...and that's saying a lot! Someone is bewitching objects and launching attacks on Hogwarts students...one of the most popular characters becomes gravely ill as a result of drinking a poisoned beverage. When Dumbledore and Harry set off on their climactic quest at the end of the book, the horrors they encounter are too gruesome to put in words. Young readers will ultimately be disturbed by what they read. (I'm a 25-year-old reader, and I'll probably be having nightmares for weeks! Seriously, when it comes time for \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" and \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" to be made into movies, I don't see how Warner Brothers will manage to avoid \\"R\\" ratings.)<br /><br />Ultimately, the end of this novel is the most tragic and heartbreaking of any book in the series so far. It was also the most shocking. Personally, I had a feeling that I knew which character was going to die...it made sense to me that Harry would need to go into Book Seven as utterly alone as possible, and Rowling set it up so that's exactly what will happen. However, I was absolutely stunned when the final death took place, and that's all because of the second chapter of the book, when Snape meets with Bellatrix and Narcissaand pledges an Unbreakable Vow. Now, I have always had a soft spot in my heart for Snape. (I think it's partially because I adore Alan Rickman, but I see now that my logic was incredibly stupid...this is a book, not a movie!) I always thought that there was something very important about Snape that readers were not privy to, and that the information would somehow redeem him. I also thought that since Dumbledore was such a great wizard, he was right in placing so much trust in Snape. I always thought that Snape really was a loyal member of the Order, and that he was putting himself at great risk by maintaining ties with the Death Eaters.<br /><br />When Snape pledged the Unbreakable Vow to Narcissa, I had a feeling that he had majorly done himself in, and that he would be totally screwed over in the end, especially since it is revealed later in the book that people who break Unbreakable Vows die. Well...I don't want to spoil things by saying more than I already have, but things did not work out exactly as I had thought. Regardless of what I have ever thought about Snape, I never expected that he would behave the way he did at the end of the book. I was absolutely stunned. BUT...it will be interesting to see what happens in Book Seven. The reason Dumbledore finally gives for trusting Snape is incredibly flimsy...perhaps there's something more to it than meets the eye...maybe Snape actually proved himself to be the most loyal member of the Order by carrying out Dumbledore's orders at the end! I have no idea how that theory will play out, but it's just an idea...with J.K. Rowling, anything is possible. We will see!<br /><br />The end of the book is unbelievably sad and depressing. It made me cry even though I saw the whole thing coming. I don't think I've been that sad since the spider died at the end of \\"Charlotte's Web\\".<br /><br />\\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" is amazing. It is mature and moving and is by far the best book in the series so far. There are a lot of open-ended questions that are leading up to Book Seven...will Harry and his friends return to Hogwarts for their final year? Will there even be a Hogwarts to go back to?

I decided to read Emily Giffin's debut novel last year because I was looking for something light and fun (and I also happened to be newly engaged and liked the sparkly diamond on the pretty pink cover!). I was pleasantly surprised to discover that GOOD chick lit actually does exist!<br /><br />To summarize the plot, \\"Something Borrowed\\" is about two girls who have been best friends their entire lives. Rachel is a smart girl with average looks who has always played second-fiddle to her glamourous, selfish friend Darcy. On the eve of Rachel's 30th birthday party, she gets drunk and ends up in bed with Darcy's fiance, Dexter. Even though Rachel tries to extinguish her feelings for Dex, she ends up falling in love with him. It turns out that Darcy had been cheating on Dex with one of his best friends, so at the end of \\"Something Borrowed,\\" Darcy and Dex break off their engagement after they learn of each other's indiscretions, leaving Dex free to be with Rachel.<br /><br />\\"Something Blue\\" picks up right where \\"Something Borrowed\\" left off, only this time the narrator switches from Rachel to Darcy. Giffin actually walks us back through the climax of \\"Something Borrowed,\\" so we get to see all the drama unfold from Darcy's point of view. As things stand, Dex and Rachel are together and Darcy is furious with both of them. However, she's pregnant by her new boyfriend, Marcus, and is excited about starting a new life with him. Unfortunately, Marcus is less than thrilled with the arrangement, and it doesn't take Darcy long to realize that her new beau isn't the fabulous catch she thought he would be. Being the conniving little witch that she is, Darcy tries every dirty trick in the book to get her life back in order again, but no one sees through her desperate charades and the only so-called \\"friends\\" she has left betray her. Poor Darcy finds herself pregnant and alone with no one to turn to. The only thing she can think of to do is flee New York and head to London to stay with her childhood friend, Ethan, in hopes of building a fresh start for herself far away from everyone that hurt her.<br /><br />At first I didn't think \\"Something Borrowed\\" would live up to its predecessor. Eventually I realized that was because Giffin does such a good job portraying Darcy as the selfish little witch that she is! However, Darcy's nastiness is what makes the book so good. We get to see how, with the help of Ethan, Darcy decides to better herself for her own sake and for the sake of her unborn baby. She hits some major bumps along the way, but by the end of the book Darcy has become even more endearing than Rachel...I never thought that would be possible, but it is!<br /><br />\\"Something Blue\\" does a great job of connecting the readers with Darcy's character and also tying up all the loose ends between Darcy, Rachel, and Dexter. I read this book in one night because I just couldn't put it down. The only thing that disappoints me is that there's really no way Giffin can write another installment of the Rachel/Darcy saga...I'm sad that it's all over! But this book is one of the rare sequels that might actually be better than the original book. I highly suggest reading \\"Something Blue\\" (and \\"Something Borrowed,\\" if you haven't already done so!).no one to turn to.

One summer while her husband is out of town, Edna takes steps to mold her own sexual identity by having an affair with a younger man.<br /><br />Readers need to look at this book in the context of its time. In this day and age, there's nothing remarkable about an unhappy housewife who seeks comfort in the arms of another man. However, back when this book was written, it created a major scandal: writing so candidly about women's sexual urges and marital infidelity was very taboo. I personally don't think that Kate Chopin's novel is one of the best written books of its age, but it's a landmark novel because it was the first book to ever tackle such \\"forbidden\\" subjects, and you have to give it a lot of credit.<br /><br />This is a very short book divided into extremely brief chapters, which makes it a pretty quick read. Although it's easy to sympathize with Edna's situation, she strikes me as being a very selfish character, and I think that put a major damper on the story for me. I thought that the resolution of Edna and Robert's affair was a bit anticlimactic, but what Edna chooses to do on the very last page is pretty shocking.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this book, but I think many people will find that it doesn't live up to their expectations.	2005-07-10

This isn't an ordinary murder mystery/thriller, however. The story begins to unfold when Susie arrives in her version of heaven and keeps watch over her grieving family and friends.<br /><br />Alice Sebold does an amazing job detailing how Susie's death affected everyone around her. Her father, Jack, allows his grief to overcome him, while his wife Abigail seeks comfort in the arms of another man and eventually tries to build a completely new life for herself. Susie's sister Lindsey struggles as she attempts to create an identity for herself that is seperate from \\"the dead girl's sister.\\" Buckley, who is too young to fully understand what happened to his big sister Susie at the time, grows up feeling like he is competing for his father's affections with the memory of a sister he never really knew.<br /><br />Susie's friends also continue to grieve for her. Ray Singh, who was the first and only boy that Susie ever kissed, is never able to let go of the memory of his first love. His friend Ruth, who barely knew Susie in life, forms an uncanny bond with her after her death and eventually manages to give Susie the one thing she wants more than anything else.<br /><br />In the midst of all this grief and coping, there is also the aspect of a serial killer being on the loose. George Harvey was viewed by most as just an eccentric neighbor, but Jack Salmon suspects his involvement in his daughter's death almost from the very beginning. Not everyone else is convinced, however, and as the months following Susie's disappearance turn into years, the reader is left wondering if justice will ever be served and if Mr. Harvey will ever be caught.<br /><br />\\"The Lovely Bones\\" deals with a heartbreaking subject matter. I was hesitant to read this book because it's all about the death of a child, and I generally don't handle that sort of thing very well. However, even though I felt like sobbing with each passing page, it's an absolutely beautiful story about love, loss, life, and death. My review doesn't even begin to do it justice...just go out and buy the damn book! You'll be so glad that you did.well.

US	48233483	R1Z8CINVN87K33	0871136791	11590154	Cold Mountain	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Beautiful prose, heartbreaking story	This is a great novel with beautiful writing, but it's not the typical Civil War novel I expected it to be. There are two main characters in \\"Cold Mountain.\\" Inman is a former Confederate soldier who became disillusioned with the war and, after sustaining serious injuries in a battle, decides to desert and makes his way on a long and dangerous journey home to Cold Mountain, where he hopes to be reunited with the woman he loves. Meanwhile, his beloved Ada faces serious problems of her own after the death of her father. Together with her industrious friend Ruby, she struggles to maintain the farm she inherited in order to secure her own survival.<br /><br />Most of the novel jumps back and forth between Ada and Inman. We are treated to flashbacks of the potential relationship that they had built before the war, and we watch each of them fight their own personal battles to make it through very difficult times.<br /><br />There are many colorful characters that Ada and Inman come into contact with along the way, but when the couple is finally reunited at the end of the story, Charles Frazier leaves things about as depressing as they could possibly be. Although the romantic element to this novel is disappointing because of the tragic ending, \\"Cold Mountain\\" really is a beautiful story. Readers who are expecting depictions of graphic battles may be disappointed, because there isn't much of that in the book...this is a very unique spin on the Civil War era, and anyone who enjoys reading books about that period will appreciate this clever and endearing novel.	2005-06-27
US	48233483	R33758RHNFMEXM	0385511809	740331338	Saturday: A novel	Books	2	8	13	N	N	I didn't enjoy this one at all	I wish I had better things to say about this book. The basic plot of \\"Saturday\\" is a good one: a British neurosurgeon has a chance encounter with a crazy man out on the street one day, and the crazy man eventually follows the doctor home and invades his household with his degenerate friend. This could have the potential to be a very interesting story, but the problem is that 90% of the book is composed of Ian McEwan's detailed descriptions about nothing. Is it REALLY NECESSARY to include six pages of text that serve no purpose except to describe how the main character in the story selects fish at the market? I don't think so. It's a shame, too, because I've heard such good things about McEwan's other book, \\"Atonement,\\" and \\"Saturday\\" left a lot to be desired. (Side note: the most interesting part of the story has nothing to do with the main character, Perowne. I thought that the relationship between his daughter, Daisy, and his father-in-law, Grammaticus, was much more intriguing. If McEwan had chosen to focus on those characters a bit more, I would probably be writing a much more positive review!)	2005-06-18

There's Tony, a history professor with an eccentric husband; Charis, a New-Age flower child; and Roz, a successful businesswoman. These women have one thing in common: they've all been duped by Zenia, a former classmate of theirs who befriended each woman in turn and eventually stole all of their men. Although Zenia supposedly died in an explosion years ago, the women are stunned when she turns up in a restaurant one afternoon, still very much alive.<br /><br />\\"The Robber Bride\\" constantly jumps back in time, telling each woman's individual story and explaining how the mysterious Zenia managed to dupe all of them. The characters are all very interesting, especially Zenia (for some reason I can picture Catherine Zeta Jones playing her in a movie adaptation of this book), but the novel lacks the depth and focus that is prevalent in Atwood's other books.<br /><br />This is a very entertaining story, but it's not Atwood's best effort (although I did enjoy it).	2005-06-07

Basically, \\"A Kiss Before Dying\\" tells the story of a very ambitious man who is faced with a problem: he's managed to get his girlfriend Dorothy pregnant, and he'll stop at nothing in order to make his problem disappear...even if it means murder.<br /><br />This novel is a quick read, and it's very suspenseful. Just when you think you have the whole thing figured out, Ira Levin throws another shocking curveball your way, which keeps you wondering until the very end. If you're a fan of mystery/suspense novels, this is one of the best in its class.<br /><br />(Note: this is the second Levin book that I've read, \\"The Stepford Wives\\" being the first. Even though I think \\"A Kiss Before Dying\\" is a great book, I just couldn't get into it as much as \\"Stepford Wives.\\" That's probably just because of my personal preference, though...and I still highly recommend this book.)	2005-05-30

My dad bought this book and I picked it up to read out of sheer curiosity. To be honest, I wasn't really expecting much, but this is actually a very nice book! In addition to detailed accounts of Sylvester Stallone's personal experiences with fitness (how he trained for the \\"Rocky\\" movies, what his diet and exercise routines typically consist of), there are a substantial amount of weight-lifting exercises that feature photos of Sly demonstrating each one. The book also devotes a section to fitness for women, and Sly's wife Jennifer demonstrates all the exercises on those pages.<br /><br />\\"Sly Moves\\" also features Stallone's take on a healthy lifestyle, and although his kelp supplements and eating habits won't be ideal for everyone, he makes some good points and always backs up his reasoning with personal experience, which is nice.<br /><br />Bottom line: fans of Stallone will love this book, and its detailed exercise instructions and illustrations make it one of the few halfway-decent workout/eating books on the market.	2005-05-30

The story centers around Nicolas des Innocents, a 15th-century painter of ill repute who is commissioned to design a series of tapestries for a weathly Parisian nobleman, Jean Le Viste. Nicholas immediately finds himself drawn to Le Viste's daughter, Claude. The couple's passion is forbidden, and Chevalier then branches out by dividing the narration of the book between a handful of characters who are all struggling with their own unrecognized desires.<br /><br />This is an interesting story, but I wasn't nearly as wrapped up in it as I was with \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring.\\" The characters are all rather forgettable and the main protagonist is very unlikeable, so it was difficult to really get excited about the story. If readers pick up \\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\" with the expectation that it will be as good as other Chevalier books they've read, then they'll be in for a disappointment.<br /><br />I need to comment on the physical attributes of the book itself. The hardcover edition of \\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\" is a beautiful book to LOOK AT. When you remove the book jacket, you'll discover that the glossy cover of the book depicts several scenes from the actual Lady and the Unicorn tapestries that are currently on display in a Paris museum. The paper also has an old-fashioned quality to it, making this a beautiful book to add to your collection. The best thing about the book is its actual design...I wish I could say more about the story itself!	2005-05-15
US	48233483	R188C89O6XXWO9	0743486226	141370518	Angels & Demons	Books	4	2	5	N	Y	Farfetched but fun	After reading \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" (which I enjoyed very much), I knew I eventually wanted to read \\"Angels and Demons.\\" After the death of John Paul II, I went ahead and ordered the book because I thought it would be even more interesting to read it while an actual conclave was in progress so I could see how fiction lived up to reality.<br /><br />\\"Angels and Demons\\" is actually a prequel to \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" Once again, the character of Robert Langdon is central to the story. When renowned scientist Dr. Leonardo Vetra is murdered at a Swiss research lab, Robert is summoned to help decipher a mysterious symbol that was burned into the victim's chest. All the clues point to the involvement of the Illuminati, an ancient group of scientists that supposedly disbanded years ago. One mystery leads to another, and eventually Langdon and Vetra's daughter, Vittoria, journey to Rome in search of a missing vial containing a substance called antimatter, which has been stolen with the intention of being used to blow up Vatican City. There also happens to be a conclave going on, and four cardinals who are considered to be prime papal contenders suddenly disappear as well. Robert and Vittoria desperately attempt to decipher ancient clues in order to find the killer, save the cardinals, and preserve Vatican City.<br /><br />Even though \\"Angels and Demons\\" is a work of fiction, it offers a surprisingly accurate description of the procedures that take place during a papal conclave. Of course, in typical Dan Brown style, the storyline is somewhat farfetched, but also unbelievably exciting. The one major criticism I have is that \\"Angels and Demons\\" basically follows the same plot outline as \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" which strikes me as being pretty unimaginative on the author's part...then again, I still enjoyed this book in spite of its predictability, so maybe Brown just took a formula he knew would work and decided to run with it. There's no real harm in that.<br /><br />I was also a bit disappointed by the \\"surprise twist\\" that was revealed in the final forty pages of the book. The extent of the camerlengo's involvement and the whole idea that he was actually the pope's illegitimate son was a little too much to swallow. I would have been happier if Max Kohler had been the brainpower behind the whole operation...that just seems a bit more plausible.<br /><br />In spite of its shortcomings, I have to admit that \\"Angels and Demons\\" was a very entertaining read. I found it just as fascinating as \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" and I probably enjoyed it more because I've been so captivated by the recent John Paul II/conclave coverage in the media.

Philippa Gregory retells the story of Anne Boleyn as seen through the eyes of her younger sister, Mary. The Boleyn Girls, along with their brother George, have been attending the king of England's court since they were children. At the age of fourteen, Mary captures the attention of King Henry VIII. Despite the fact that both of them are already married, Mary and Henry become lovers at the insistance of the Boleyn family, which uses Mary as a pawn in its desire for advancement within the royal circle. Mary struggles with her desires for the king, her loyalty to her husband, and her rivalry with her sister, Anne, who eventually surpasses Mary in the king's eyes and sets her sights on becoming the next queen of England.<br /><br />There isn't a dull moment in this book...even though it's almost 700 pages long, I finished it in just a few days because I found it impossible to put down! Anyone who enjoys British history will get a kick out of this wonderful retelling of one of the most scandalous events in England's history. \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" offers rich characterizations and an exciting plot that will keep readers entertained until the very end, even though anyone who's ever picked up a history book already knows what the outcome of this tragic story will be.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to everyone...you won't be disappointed!	2005-04-17

Darcy is...well, she's not a very nice person! She's selfish and insensitive, and she's also everything Rachel THINKS she wants to be: pretty, popular, charming, and lucky in love. On the evening of Rachel's 30th birthday party, she gets drunk and shares a cab with Darcy's fiance, Dex. One thing leads to another, and the two of them end up in bed.<br /><br />The thing I really like about \\"Something Borrowed\\" is that the character of Rachel is very down to earth. She struggles with the feelings she has for Dex as their one night stand blossoms into a full-blown affair, and she is plagued with guilt about betraying her best friend. The story is fast-paced and exciting, and the ending is pretty unexpected (at least it was to me).<br /><br />My only major gripe with this book is that Dex never seemed like that great of a catch to me. He treats Rachel and Darcy like crap throughout the whole book, and yet Rachel (who otherwise seems like a pretty intelligent woman) doesn't see through him and keeps him around. He doesn't seem worth it to me, but oh well.<br /><br />I recommend \\"Something Borrowed\\" to any woman who is looking for something fun to read. There's a sequel to the book that's due out this summer, and I'll definitely want to read it.	2005-04-05
US	48233483	R6QI4UPQJDR2P	0760702985	821153252	Dracula	Books	5	4	5	N	N	The ultimate horror novel	I just reread this book for the fourth or fifth time, and I never get tired of it. \\"Dracula\\" is probably the greatest horror novel ever written, and it's also a great example of a solid 19th-century Victorian novel. The story begins in Transylvania, where a young man pays a visit to one of his clients, Count Dracula, and makes a horrifying discovery. When disturbing incidents begin to unfold in England, a small group of friends ban together to put an end to the evil that threatens their sustenance.<br /><br />There are so many people out there who are vaguely familiar with this story, but I assure you that there is much more to Dracula that is waiting to be discovered within the pages of this amazing novel. One of the most interesting things about the book is the description of Dracula himself, which differs dramatically from the way that Hollywood has portrayed him in the past. I think most readers will be surprised to learn how things unfold in the original story, but rest assured that the book is even more enjoyable than any of the movie versions available.<br /><br />This edition of the book is definitely the best out there. The Edward Gorey illustrations are striking, and this is a must-have purchase for any Dracula fan or avid book collector. (Note: my copy of \\"Dracula\\" has a different Gorey illustration on the cover...it's a picture of the Count himself, not a bat. Perhaps there are several different versions available?)	2005-04-01

It's amazing that Martin Amis wrote such a great book when he was only in his 20s, but in some respects, it's quite obvious that \\"The Rachel Papers\\" was written by someone so young because the narration is so brilliantly accurate.<br /><br />This is the story of Charles Highway, an Oxford-bound adolescent who battles personal demons, family issues, and soon finds himself facing the biggest challenge of his life thus far: managing to get a girl named Rachel into bed with him.<br /><br />Charles is a hilarious character because he's so easily identifiable to today's youth (even though this novel was written over 30 years ago). Highway appears to be a bookish intellectual on the outside, but the raunchy thoughts that run through his mind are along the same lines of any and every horny young man who can think of nothing else but his next sexual conquest. Although the graphic sexual material might make the average reader blush, it is depicted in such a way that it gives the reader even more insight into this character.<br /><br />This is a great book...a bit vulgar in places, but hilarious.	2005-03-15
US	48233483	RM8TOS5IFGDB	0446670251	437057713	The Virgin Suicides	Books	2	6	7	N	N	Not as good as I'd expected it to be	This is the first Jeffrey Eugenides novel I've read, and I was disappointed with it. The premise of the story is interesting enough: a teenage girl from a small suburban town kills herself one day, and her four sisters follow suit in less than a year. But I just couldn't get into the book at all.<br /><br />The biggest issue I have with it is the narration, which is told from the collective point of view of a group of high school boys who lived in the same town as the Lisbon sisters. It was an interesting choice to give such an \\"outsider looking in\\" perspective on the sisters and their tragedy, but I kept hoping for more details which never surfaced. Instead, Eugenides focused on portraying the mystery of suicide and all the questions that remain after something like this happens. That's all well and good, but as a result, there are pages and pages of senseless speculation that drag on forever and really made me lose interest. \\"Virgin Suicides\\" is a pretty short book to begin with, but I think it could have been even shorter to spare the reader from having to read all those boring excess pages.<br /><br />Along those same lines, there really isn't much dialogue in the book, which makes the pace of the story even slower. On the one hand, the narrators had so little contact with the Lisbon sisters that there really wasn't much dialogue for them to recollect. However, a lack of dialogue can get boring after a while, which is what happened here.<br /><br />I haven't seen the film adaptation of this novel, but I hear it's pretty good. This might be one of those rare instances when I end up liking a movie version better than the original book.	2005-03-10

It chronicles the romance of Henry and Clare, who appear to be a normal, happy couple on the outside, but something about Henry makes their relationship very unique. Henry suffers from a condition called chrono-displacement disorder, which means that he occasionally disappears and involuntarily time-travels into his past and, every so often, into his future.<br /><br />Audrey Niffenegger does an incredible job of sequencing the events of the book (which jump around as often as Henry time-travels) in a way that is clear and enthralling to the reader. The narration of the book also alternates between Henry and Clare's points of view, giving us deep insight into both of these remarkable characters.<br /><br />As a science fiction novel and also one of the greatest modern love stories written to date, \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" blends intense character study with charm, cleverness, and raw emotion. The reader will laugh and cry as Henry and Clare experience the \\"normal\\" challenges that people face in relationships, as well as the constant uncertainty that time travel brings into their lives (and in some cases, absolute certainty about a future that cannot be altered).<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this book very much, and it is definitely a book that I recommend to everyone.	2005-03-06

Sixteen-year-old Griet is forced to leave home and go to work as a maid for a painter and his family in order to provide for her family. Although she faces numerous challenges with most members of the Vermeer household, Griet slowly begins to bond with her master, who commissions her to help him in his studio and eventually has her sit for one of his paintings.<br /><br />This book is interesting on many different levels.  For one thing, creating this fictitious tale based on such a famous piece of art is intriguing, and Tracy Chevalier's characters are all very believable. Having the story narrated from Griet's point of view was also an excellent choice. The reader is treated to a description of how life was for a young woman living in poverty during the 17th century. Griet is forced into so much during the course of this novel, and all her options seem vert limited: there could be serious consequences if she continues to work for the Vermeer family, but her family will starve if she chooses to leave. There is also the potential of romance with a young suitor, but Griet is torn between a \\"sensible\\" relationship with Pieter and the growing feeling she has for her master.<br /><br />The relationship between Griet and Vermeer is very mysterious and still leaves a lot of questions until the very end. We become aware of Griet's feelings for her master, but how does Vermeer really feel about her?  Griet's interaction with the other women is also interesting to follow...Vermeer's wife sees her as a threat, Tanneke sees her as a rival, and Cornelia sees her as someone to destroy. The relationships between all of the women in her life escalate as the story progresses, which makes the final confrontation in the last few pages of the book even more powerful.<br /><br />I would recommend \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring\\" to anyone. Now that I've read the novel, I am very eager to see the movie version...hopefully Hollywood didn't butcher it beyond repair. :)movie version...hopefully Hollywood didn't butcher it beyond repair. :) <br />	2005-02-20

There are two major things that distinguish \\"The Love Machine\\" from Jacqueline Susann's other novels: the main character is a man, and the book has a happy ending (at least in my opinion).<br /><br />This book is a very entertaining read.  The story centers around Robin Stone, a smart and sexy television executive who's climbing the corporate ladder and breaking the hearts of many women along the way.  Although it seems at times that Robin has no conscience because of the way he treats women, he really isn't a malicious character and doesn't intend to harm to anyone. Regardless of the fact that he always makes it clear that he's not interested in a long-term relationship, women still tend to fall for him, and they fall very hard. The book is divided into three main sections devoted to the women who are affected by Robin the most: Amanda, a beautiful and emotional model; Maggie, a brilliant journalist; and Judith, a middle-aged socialite.<br /><br />Robin is a very interesting character.  He's so charismatic that he even manages to charm the reader, and you'll be rooting for him in spite of all his indiscretions.  There is also a deeply buried secret in Robin's past that makes him become vulnerable in very unexpected circumstances, and the mystery surrounding him will keep the reader guessing until the very end.  I also enjoyed how Robin interacted differently with all the various women in his life. The last section in the book devoted to Judith was a little slow, but that could be because I was expecting a last-minute dramatic turn of events like I've seen in Susann's other novels, and this book was a little different.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Jacqueline Susann's other novels, you really need to read \\"The Love Machine.\\" My only disappointment is that this was the last book of Susann's I had left to read...I wish she had written many more!	2005-02-17

When my fiance surprised me with the illustrated edition, I was happy that I'd finally get a chance to read the book, but I also didn't understand why there was an illustrated edition available.  Once I started reading, however, I was very grateful to have the illustrated edition in hand.<br /><br />Revealing too much of the plot of this book will take away from the pleasure of reading it, so I'm not going to say too much.  Basically, the story begins when someone is murdered at the Louvre museum, setting into motion a cryptic chain of events that lead to a religious secret which has been kept under wraps for thousands of years.  This is a fast-paced, intriguing novel that elaborates on actual conspiracy theories that have been talked about for centuries.  (Now I understand why certain religious circles are all up in arms about the content of this book!)  I think that anyone who has even a remote interest in theology will love this book, and anyone else just looking for a good thriller to read will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Dan Brown references many historical landmarks and objects in his book, which is why this illustrated edition is so convenient.  Unless you have a very strong background in art and religious history and know Paris and London like the back of your hand, chances are that you'll get a little lost in some places, which is where the illustrations come in.  Photographs of historical landmarks and images of famous works of art act as key reference points throughout the book that will make reading it even more enjoyable.<br /><br />If you haven't read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" yet, I highly suggest you do it soon and not wait for Hollywood to butcher the story with the movie version.  I also recommend shelling out the extra few bucks needed to purchase the illustrated edition: you'll be glad you did.	2005-01-31

The story revolves around January Wayne, a tragic heroine who has an unnatural adoration for her father and is unable to have a successful relationship with another man because of it.  When her father marries a wealthy woman to secure his family's financial future, January finally falls in love.  Unfortunately for her, the man she falls for is Tom Colt, a married man who is older than her father.

There are some funny moments in the book, but for the most part it consists of tragedy and unhappiness.  The final few chapters threw me for a loop because the ending is more depressing than either of Susann's other novels.

I cannot BELIEVE it took me so long to read \\"Valley of the Dolls!\\"  So many people have raved about the book to me, and I just dismissed it as another cult novel.  I finally got around to reading it, though, and I was blown away.  It was INCREDIBLY entertaining!  The characters are fun, fresh, and easy to relate to.  The story of three women struggling to find themselves in brutal New York City never gets dull for a second.  It's a pretty long book, but I finished it very quickly because I never wanted to put it down.  I highly recommend this book to everyone!	2004-12-14
US	48233483	R1KLAALEUCI0RF	038549081X	709722953	The Handmaid's Tale	Books	5	0	1	N	Y	Very compelling	This novel takes place in the not-so-distant future, when the United States government has been destroyed after a nuclear war and the country is in a dangerous state of polical unrest.  In an atmosphere reminiscent of World War II Europe, people constantly live in fear and are afraid to do just about anything because simply looking at someone the wrong way can warrant an immediate execution.  Additionally, women's rights have been completely relinquished.  Offred, the main character in the story, has been separated from her husband and daughter and is now a lowly handmaid: her sole \\"purpose\\" in life is to be a sex slave to her master in hopes of getting pregnant and bearing a child to give to the Commander and his wife.<br /><br />This is a chilling and very thought-provoking novel that I suspect will especially be appreciated by women readers.  I highly recommend it.	2004-12-14

This is a really cute stationary set: the paper is nice and thick and the design is adorable.

US	48233483	RGPY3JDCDBEZ7	0380977788	425362981	Coraline	Books	3	3	6	N	N	Disappointing	I was anxious to read \\"Coraline\\" because I'd heard such great things about it, but I don't really understand what all the fuss is about.  The premise of the story is quite interesting: a young girl discovers a locked door in her home that leads to another apartment that is identical to her own, except for the fact that her \\"other\\" parents (with their creepy black button eyes) want to keep her with them forever, conforming her to their standards and never let her go.<br /><br />The concept of the two worlds is good, but the story resolves itself before we ever find out why the alternate world exists in the first place.  I think this book could have been longer and the author could have elaborated in a lot of areas.  As it is, the book starts off strong but leaves a lot to be desired when you reach the end.<br /><br />Also, the book is supposed to be for children ages eight and up.  If I read this book when I was eight, I would have had nightmares for weeks.  The creepy illustrations alone are enough to give any child nightmares.  If this is a book you're considering purchasing for your child, I strongly suggest that you read through it first to make sure your kid can handle it.	2004-08-15

Joanna, the main character, makes a few \\"normal\\" friends in her new neighborhood, but she soon realizes that most of the women in town seem to exist for the sole purpose of pleasing their husbands, lacking any personal ambitions of their own.  She begins to suspect that all the men in town are involved in an evil conspiracy, and that even her own husband is out to get her.<br /><br />The story is suspenseful and entertaining.  My only two complaints are that it's too short (I finished the book in just under two hours) and it leaves a lot of questions unanswered.  We know what happens to Joanna at the end of the story, but I would have liked a little more information about how the men's club was able to orchestrate everything.  The flip side of that, though, is that a lot is left up to your own imagination, which makes it even more terrifying.	2004-08-15

It's all about Dick Cheney as Dr. Evil and John Ashcroft's barbershop quartet outfit (\\"Let the eeeeeagles soar...\\").  This is a very humorous souvenir of what will hopefully be the first and FINAL term of the Bush presidency.  My only complaint is that the paper dolls aren't secured in their pages very well, and they started coming loose as soon as I turned the first page.

I bought my copy the day it was released and I just finished it a few days ago.  What I like most about the book is that you can tell that Clinton wrote every single word himself: his cadence is very apparent and I could here his voice in my mind reading to me as I made my way through (and I don't even have the audio book!).<br /><br />Clinton does tend to be long-winded at times and he has always enjoyed talking about himself (which is obvious since his book is over 900 pages long).  However, he is a great speaker and a wonderful storyteller, and I enjoyed reading all about his life growing up and his chronicle of life in the White House.  There are a lot of humorous stories and also some very personal ones.  Like any presidential memoir, Clinton's book defends a lot of the choices he made while in office and also points the finger at others for making bad political decisions and for unjustly attacking the Clinton presidency.<br /><br />I thought \\"My Life\\" was a very honest account of Clinton's upbringing and political career, as well as his personal and professional shortcomings.  I hope he writes another book someday.	2004-08-12

A professor suggested that I check it out, and I'm glad I did.  I became a Dreamweaver expert without having to attend a class or ask a lot of questions, because everything you could possibly want to know is right in front of you!  When I bought the book, I had a good grasp on how to use Microsoft FrontPage but wanted to learn a more sophisticated program.  The book details everything I needed to know in order to build a professional site in Dreamweaver and provides picture tutorials for every step.  It is the equivalent of taking a Dreamweaver class and watching the instructor go through all the different steps using a projected computer screen, but this is even better because you can go back and re-read things if they don't make sense at first (although that rarely happens).  This whole series of books is worth checking out if you need an introduction on how to use a new program.	2004-08-12

It's pretty obvious that this was Lauren Weisberger's first attempt at a novel, because the book isn't very well-written and just doesn't &quot;flow&quot; very well at all.  That being said, however, I found &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; to be incredibly entertaining.  It's definitely a &quot;fluff&quot; book lacking any sort of brilliant literary genius and is solely meant to provide the reader with some light, amusing reading.  It's easy to relate to Andrea as she deals with the trials and tribulations of working for the most powerful and sadistic woman in the fashion industry.  The descriptions of Andrea's boss are hysterical, and Miranda's behavior will have you rolling your eyes, cursing out loud, and rolling into fits of laughter.<br />The best parts of the book are the sections devoted to chronicling Andrea's professional nightmares at &quot;Runway&quot; magazine, which thankfully account for most of the story.  There are several supporting characters that just seem to be thrown into the book at random intervals (Andy's boyfriend, her alcoholic best friend, that guy Christian that she's always flirting with...what is the POINT of that relationship?!  It never goes ANYWHERE and just sort of hangs there!), and the plot screeches to a halt and really drags whenever these supporting players show up.  It seems like the author throws them in there simply so they're around to wrap up the ending of the book, which is very anticlimactic, rushed,  and pretty disappointing.  I had an idea of how I'd have liked the story to end, and Weisberger only met my expectations halfway.<br />For a first-time effort, this was a pretty good book: very entertaining and definitely worth reading if you're looking for something to keep you mindlessly entertained.  I think it would have been much better if the supporting characters were a bit more developed (or cut out entirely: you could easily have shaved 150 off the book that way) and if the plot wasn't quite so jumpy.  Still, I'm glad I read it.  Miranda Priestly is a great character...I hope someone makes this book into a movie someday.  It would be hysterical!'m glad I read it.

I ordered this book when I saw it listed on Amazon and I prayed that it would be good, and it turned out to be FABULOUS!  The poster art of the Bond movies (especially the earlier ones) is legendary, and this book has taken the most memorable Bond posters and created a fabulous keepsake.  I was impressed that so many posters were included, and I especially enjoyed seeing the posters for Bond movies from around the world...it's interesting to see how different countries promote the films.  (For example, in France's promo posters for &quot;The World is Not Enough,&quot; Sophie Marceau is positioned in front of Pierce Brosnan and Denise Richards, which is different from other versions of the poster.)  All in all, this is a wonderful book for Bond fans to add to their collections!	2004-04-08

In addition to experiencing the typical woes of a young man his age and embarking on his first romantic relationship with a fellow student, Harry also faces his greatest opposition yet in \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,\\" the fifth installment of J.K. Rowling's series.<br />This book is the darkest novel in the series thus far, and it opens with Harry increasingly angry and frustrated with his life.  He resents that he has been sent back to live with his abysmal Muggle relatives, who have come to resent Harry more than they ever have before.  Harry is also anxiously awaiting news from his friends from the magical world about the status of Lord Voldemort, the evil dark wizard restored to life at the end of \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.<br />Harry soon finds himself at the center of a vicious defamation campaign headed by the Ministry of Magic, which is determined to prove that rumors about the Dark Lord returning are false.  The Order of the Phoenix, a group of witches and wizards who are trying to show the Ministry that Voldemort has indeed returned, helps Harry in his time of need and also vows to bring Voldemort's power to an end.<br />The challenges of being a fifth-year student at Hogwarts also complicate Harry's life in book five.  He finally has a chance to explore his romantic feelings for Cho Chang, but given the tragic events that occurred at the end of \\"Goblet of Fire,\\" Harry's first real relationship with a girl hits some major bumps along the way.  All of the fifth-year students are busy preparing to take their Ordinary Wizarding Levels at the end of the year, and the stress of studying, topped off with the hormonal and emotional changes that Harry is experiencing, result in his toughest year yet.<br />In addition to many familiar characters, Rowling introduces many new characters in book five.  Harry finally gets to know the real Mad-Eye Moody, who has recovered from Voldemort's stunning spell and is now one of the key members of the Order.  In addition, Harry meets Nymphadora Tonks, a klutzy and outgoing Metamorphusmagus/Auror.  Another new face is Kreacher, a merciless old house elf who does not appreciate what the Order is trying to do, and Dolores Umbridge, the most belligerent Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher that Hogwarts has ever had.  Earlier characters whom readers will likely be surprised to see again also make appearances.  As becomes obvious in book five, many of the characters in Harry's life are connected in ways he never imagined.<br />\\"Phoenix\\" is different from the other books in the series in several ways.  Harry is definitely growing up, and he's beginning to resent the fact that his life has been soured in so many ways.  For most of the book, Harry feels as if the people he has come to rely on the most aren't being completely honest with him. That infuriates Harry to no end.  After all, it was Harry who managed to escape from Voldemort's grasp at the end of book four, so why won't anyone tell him what the Dark Lord is up to now?<br />In book five, Harry is quick to anger and doesn't hesitate before lashing out at anyone who has wronged him in some way.  His anger is definitely justified, however, (who can blame the kid for being upset about the murder of his parents, the unkindness of his only living relatives, and the fact that Lord Voldemort seems as if he will stop at nothing until Harry is dead?) and he is still just as likeable and sympathetic a character as ever.<br />The end of the novel fits the same formula of Rowling's other novels: there is a lengthy battle from which Harry manages to escape, but a beloved character meets an untimely end.  The scene is terribly sad, and as a result of what happens, one of Harry's elders decides to reveal the truth about Harry's destiny.  Although this new information is something that has always been implied, itis finally declared outright and paves the way for the challenges that Harry will undoubtedly face in the final two novels of the series.<br />Since this is the longest book in the series so far, it also drags a bit in spots, especially toward the middle when the story revolves around Harry's time at school. The major action in the story takes place in the last fifty pages or so.  A formula typical of all Rowling's books and therefore something of a letdown, since fans know the sequence of events by heart.<br />However, book five is the most emotional book in the series so far, as Rowling paves the way for the final two books.  Harry's relationships with other people are becoming increasingly complicated, and this book rises above its predecessors in terms of maturation and character development.  While the Harry Potter series is still appropriate for kids, it's difficult to classify \\"Phoenix\\" as a children's book, since it explores themes that are much darker than any depicted in the first four books.  Harry and his friends are getting older, and their interests are evolving.  Also, since Voldemort is continuing to gain power, his confrontations with people have become increasingly violent, which means that small children might find some things in the book frightening.  However, older readers are likely to declare this as Rowling's best work to date.<br />At the end of the book, a second war against Voldemort and his Death Eaters appears imminent.  There are plenty of questions that need to be answered, and an inevitable battle looms on the horizon, but it's unlikely that it will take place before book seven.<br />The only thing we can be sure of at this point is that as soon as readers finish this book, they'll start clamoring for book six., it is finally declared outright and paves the way for the challenges that Harry will undoubtedly face in the final two novels of the series.<br />Since this is the longest book in the series so far, it also drags a bit in spots, especially toward the middle when the story revolves around Harry's time at school.

Ariel Dorfman was a Chilean exile who feared that he might &quot;disappear&quot; if he attempted to live and work under the Pinochet dictatorship.  &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; is a sort of autobiography for Dorfman.  The play centers around the character of Paulina, a woman who ultimately kidnaps the man she suspects of holding her prisoner and presiding over her torture and rape many years ago.  It's a suspenseful play that tackles the issues of justice and retribution, but it also has elements of suspense and mystery: is Dr. Miranda really the person that Paulina thinks he is?  This is an excellent play that's fairly well-known, yet it's hardly ever staged for some reason, which is a shame.  (Note: Never, EVER subject yourself to the Sigourney Weaver/Ben Kingsley movie version.  It is so awful.)	2004-04-07

Hillary Clinton comes across as being very insightful and intelligent.  It's easy to look at her and just see her as being Bill Clinton's wife, but she had a very successful career prior to her marriage and she has a successful career now.  It was interesting to read about Hillary's perceptions on politics and being a woman in a profession that (unfortunately) is often dominated by men.  People who were expecting this book to be a trashy tell-all book about her husband are ignorant to think that a woman like Hillary would write something like that in the first place.

He's not a scientist and not exactly a historian, but Crowe specializes in legends, and that's what ghost stories are made of.  This book contains summaries of Chicago's most famous ghost stories, including Resurrection Mary and John Dillinger.

I can't wait to get the 2004 edition!	2004-04-05

What a wonderful treat for French kitty fans!  These notecards come in an adorable slipcase and feature five brightly-colored images from French Kitty's first book.  These cards have different images than the first set of cards that were released, and I actually prefer this set better.  Each card is printed on heavy paper with a glossy cover and comes with a powder pink envelope.  It would be nice if the cards were a bit bigger, but die-hard French Kitty fans won't mind the small size!	2004-04-05

I've been waiting for AGES in anxious anticipation of this book being released, and all that waiting was worth it!  French Kitty's second novel is even better than the first one.  In this story, French Kitty jets off to Hawaii for the wedding of one of her good friends.  She scurries all over the island in search of the perfect wedding present, and finds adventure and romance along the way!  I give this book five stars, and I can't WAIT for the next installment!!!	2004-04-05

Each chapter is told from the perspective of a different character, and each character has a very distinct style.  Some of the text is harder to weed through than other parts, but it's still a very enjoyable read.	2004-04-05

A great source for those researching theatre and theatre history as well as reading up on Shakespeare himself.  Highly recommended.	2001-01-26
