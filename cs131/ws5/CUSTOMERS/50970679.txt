Books	3	5	7	N	Y	Good storyline, gratuitous violence &amp; filthy language	I really enjoyed the basic premise of this book, Jaye finds out she and her brother Patrick are adopted, Patrick needs a bone marrow transplant because of leukemia, so she heads off into their past to find his blood relatives.  But this book was filled with so much excessive and unnecessary violence and nasty language, I really could not enjoy it that much.  If you don't mind reading that kind of stuff, then I would recommend this book to you because it was a pretty good mystery.  But there are so many other wonderful mystery books out there that can do the job without filthy language and violence, I would suggest something else.	2001-03-19
US	50970679	R2BUIO2AO9ZM6H	0312266324	52317828	A Place of Execution	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	5 stars doesn't give this extraordinary novel its due	When 13 year old Alison Carter goes missing in rural England, in 1963, from a remote insular small village, Detective Inspector George Bennett is put in charge of the investigation.  That he is newly promoted to this position and feeling a little insecure in his new job adds another dimension to the story.  When people say they could not put a book down, this is one book I will think of.  I was absolutely obsessed with getting to the ending and stayed up late several nights to finish it.  If you enjoy crime novels without too much descriptive violence, I would highly recommend this book.  I don't think you would be sorry.  Definitely one of the best books I've read in the past year.	2001-03-01

Even though Ariel doesn't know who she is or who is trying to kill her, I liked her from the start.  Obviously a smart, independent woman used to fending for and taking care of herself, she makes a great character for the first in a series of books.  By the end of the book Ariel has made herself into a better person that she was before the amnesia and along the way we get to enjoy a great mystery story.  Thanks Amazon for introducing me to this author.  I eagerly look forward to the other books in the series.	2001-01-07

Cass de Warenne is raising her sister Tracey's young daughter because Tracey is too busy with her jetsetting lifestyle to fit a child into it.  Cass's constant worry is that Tracey will someday decide she wants to be a mother to her daughter Alyssa, and Cass would then lose Alyssa forever.  When Tracey brings a new beau home, Antonio de la Barca, Cass is unprepared for her feelings toward her sister's newest conquest and from there things get very interesting.  It seems the de Warenne family and the de la Barca family have a shared history of over 400 years, with a common ancestor, Isabel.  The story then goes back and forth in time as we learn about what happened to Isabel 450 years ago and why she has been haunting the two families since then.  The ghostly happenings do get a little farfetched, but I still loved every minute of it.  This book was great fun to read and I would recommend it if you enjoy ghost romance mysteries.	2000-11-07

To find out what Merrick did, you have to read the entire book, so I can't disclose here what it was.  For me, that is the tantalizing question, maybe, hopefully, we will find out in the next installment.  I was anxiously awaiting this book's release, mainly because of its supposed tie to the Mayfair witches, but that connection is practically nil.  I think the angle of the Mayfair witches with the vampires would have been a fabulous combination, but that is not what we get.  This book seemed more of an introduction to another story than a story in its own right.  But Anne Rice has had me hooked for many years and although I was slightly disappointed in this one, I anxiously await the next.	2000-10-31

I thought the story of 40s something Sam being dumped by her cold, jerky husband, of course for the obligatory younger female, was fabulous.  And you don't have to be a divorcee to enjoy this book.  It's more about being a woman and how we react to life and situations.  I thought every word was beautifully written and just SO TRUE!  There is so much humor in this book, I laughed out loud and cried at the end.  This is my first book by Ms. Berg, but will definitely be picking up her others.	2000-10-18

I know Ms. Michaels holds a Ph.D. in Egyptology and the back cover blurb led me to believe this storyline would pertain to Egypt, but it did so only in a minor way.  We follow 22 year old Haskell on her search to find out who her real father was and also to learn the truth about her mother's mysterious death when Haskell was an infant.  The ending is a surprise, as was which of the several men pursuing Haskell that she picks, but getting there took a long time.	2000-10-15

Maybe that's what the author was going for, nothing and no-one in life is perfect and we don't all get happy endings.  We just go on, doing what we think is best, and live with whatever mistakes and poor decisions that we make.  This is a quick suspenseful read, well worth your time.	2000-10-08

Just because we don't see something or someone, doesn't mean it isn't there.  Ms. Gloss does an interesting job of showing us Charlotte's life in the early 1900s of Oregan.  We then follow her into the wilderness in search of a lost child, but the story gets even more interesting when Charlotte herself gets lost.  Her time spent with the quasi-humans was believable and I enjoyed every minute of this book.	2000-09-26
US	50970679	R3944AJSE6U942	044652154X	933426195	Mortal Sins	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Reads like a movie script.	We follow Daman Rourke, a homicide cop, as he investigates a murder in New  Orleans in 1927.  But this murder is very personal for him, since he knew  the deceased, the deceased's wife (who used to be the love of his life),  and all the other peripheral characters involved.  Ms. Williamson ties the  many characters together in an easy to follow manner and I was kept  guessing to the end as to who the murderer was.  However, about halfway  through the book I almost considered putting it down, it just dragged on  and on and really reads like a 1940's B gangster movie.  I would recommend  this book because the ending should surprise you (with a few loose ends  left dragging) but wait for the paperback.	2000-09-19

While it was interesting to be introducted to the criminal world  of bikers, this third novel by Ms. Reichs just did not measure up to the  fascinating plot lines in her first two novels.  We spent too much time  focusing on Tempe's every day routine than we did on digging up old bones.  There was just no mystery here!  If you have not read Ms. Reich's first two  novels, expecially the first &quot;Deja Dead&quot;, I would highly  recommend that and wait for this one to be released in paperback.  Ms.  Reichs needs to refocus on what made her first two novels more fun to read,  the secrets of the long dead and a good mystery story or she will quickly  lose many of her fans.	2000-09-10

Ms. Pilcher has done a remarkable job of weaving many  different personalities into a coherent storyline that was fun and not  difficult to follow.  If you've had a bad day or just want to relax and get  lost in a good book, I would highly recommend you becoming involved in the  lives of Elfrida and her friends.	2000-08-29

I really enjoyed this story about Joanne, a stay-at-home mom who is  devastated when her husband decides to leave her &quot;to find  himself&quot;.  It was interesting watching her change from being a doormat  to her husband, her two daughters, and her best friend from high school;  all of whom take advantage of her in there own ways.  On top of having to  deal with these people who she dearly loves but who treat her like crap,  she has to put up with some maniac making threatening phone calls telling  her he's going to kill her.  Everyone assures her she's making a mountain  out of a molehole and question her sanity.  They also unkindly suggest that  she may be making the whole thing up!  As the book progresses we see Joanne  change from everybody's favorite whipping girl into an assertive,  attractive, don't walk all over me anymore kind of girl.  I was kept  guessing until the end about who her stalker was and enjoyed every minute  of this book.	2000-08-26
US	50970679	R8NK1ZVUAOB3T	0892967269	332779254	Beneath the Skin	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Creepy thriller.	We are introduced first to Zoe, a young teacher everybody will like.  We follow her ordeal into terrible fear hoping she will somehow escape.  Next we meet Jenny, who is a completely different woman from Zoe, more hardened,  lying to herself about her marriage and not quite as nice a person.  But  again, we are with her as she becomes more terrified and confused about  what is happening to her.  Then Nadia, who is strong, likeable, and what I  really enjoyed about this novel, brings a sense of humor into this story.  We follow along as the police seem to bungle at every step, making one bad  judgement after another.  This novel was as creepy as &quot;Killing Me  Softly&quot;.  I would highly recommend both and eagerly await the French's  next novel.	2000-08-02

I purchased this book because of the good ratings it received here at Amazon from editorial and fan reviews.  I also thought the premise of the book would make it a fun and interesting read.  But I was duped!  I found  the writing to be amateurish and boring.  I did manage to finish it, it was  a quick read but I would only recommend this book if you can get it at the  library or wait until it comes out in paperback.  Buyer beware and take  those 5 star reviews with a grain of salt.	2000-07-28

I found it difficult to put this book down and was unprepared for the ending.  This is definitely a book to read again  at some time in the future.  After I finished it, I spent an hour rereading  parts that had suddenly become crystal clear.  Mr. Gabriel certainly knows  his craft well.  Before I started this one, I had read &quot;The Seventh  Moon&quot; and was worried I would be disappointed that Mask couldn't  possibly be as good, I was wrong.  Looking forward to his future work.	2000-07-20

All I want to say is that every single page of this novel was precious and so beautifully written.  I had to draw my breath in with every page I turned  because I could not believe that every word this woman wrote was so filled  with humor and understanding for her characters.  It amazes me how many  fabulous writers are out there, just waiting to be discovered, and Ms.  Willis is definitely one of those.  I envy her talent and wish her every  success.

It was a little too long and drawn out but if you've got some extra time I would recommend it.  I also thought the ending fell apart a little bit, it was  kind of a letdown after all the suspense.  But if you like ghost stories,  give it a read.	2000-06-16

But I never felt it quite lived up to such high praise.  I did really enjoy it, I finished it in one day, but the whole  storyline seemed vague to me and slightly unfulfilling.  I would recommend  reading it but wait for the paperback.	2000-06-06

I really enjoyed the entire book but my favorite parts were &quot;Low Men...&quot; and &quot;Heavenly Shades...&quot;.  I have not read King's Dark Towers  series but will be purchasing it to get a better understanding of Ted and  the low men.  It seems this must have been a very difficult book for Mr.  King to write, the Viet Nam parts were gut wrenching for me and hopefully  cathartic for him to write.  I could not stop crying while reading  &quot;Heavenly Shades...&quot;, especially the paragraph about magic and  the purpose of childhood.  It was a magical novel and I was sorry to see it  end.  Peace.	2000-06-03

I could NOT put this book down and that is no exaggeration.  This book grabbed me from the very first page and did not  let go.  He made me see the wars in a much more personal way.  I felt as if  I was there with Francine through the whole book.  So many other books I  read are good, so I give them 4 stars, but this book so outclasses other  &quot;good&quot; books it's ridiculous.  Highly, highly recommended.  Enjoy!	2000-05-26

Nora's books are always fun to read, but they all follow the same basic pattern.  The one thing that was different about this book though was the fact that  the heroine didn't hate the hero at the start of the story and then grow to  love him, she liked him pretty much right from the beginning.  Reading Nora  Roberts is like watching most 1/2 hour sitcoms, enjoyable, easy to follow,  with a happy ending.  And I am not knocking that, but I think she can do  better (in her older books she did).  Maybe if Nora didn't have to knock  out a new novel every few months, she would be able to put a little more  effort into her new ones.	2000-05-11

I guess I picked the wrong book to start reading Elizabeth George.  I did find the characters interesting and wanted to know more about them, but it went on and on and on.....  I continued reading because I was intrigued by  the plot, but found it difficult to read more than a chapter at a sitting.  I finally gave up about 100 pages from the end, and sneaked a look at the  ending.  I hate doing that, BUT I COULDN'T TAKE ANYMORE!  Ms. George could  save herself alot of time and effort if in her next book she condensed the  plot by half.  I can't imagine who would have the patience to read this  thing in a reasonable period of time.	2000-01-01

James was a naive and gullible young man but I still enjoyed reading his story.  I thought both Ella and Sarah were pretty evil women.  Even though James kept telling us how wonderful Ella was, her actions did not speak of  goodness, but selfishness and self absorption.  It was a sad day for James  when he got mixed up with that family.  He should have run in the opposite  direction at the sight of either one of them.	1999-11-18

I tend to steer away from books with too much violence, sordid sex, and especially torture, but I could not put this book down.  It was a  fascinating study of witches now and in the 17th century.

It took me a third of the book to figure out it wasn't going to get any better but by that point I had to hang in there to find out how it would end.

How does this girl manage to maintain  any friendships?  And she kept getting herself into absolutely ridiculous  situations--does she have a brain in her head?

I was surprised by the large number of negative comments on this book.  I enjoyed it and did not find it that hard to believe that a teenager would have distrust in going to the police.  Especially a teen who may have had a  troubled past.  I enjoyed the interaction between the two girls and liked  them both.
