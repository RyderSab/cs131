However, COMMAND is still a great read.  The main problem I have with it is that Mara Jade seems to gain a lot of control over the force in a very short time.  The clone of Luke is a bit....well....silly.  How did Luke's hand get found by the villian?  The characters are dead on though.  I enjoyed the series a lot, but this book was a bit of a let down.  It seemed a bit rushed.  Zahn tied all his plot threads together very quickly.  The novel is worth reading, but without the entire series it would be just an average story at best.	2005-04-19

If there is a better book, I would certainly like to know about it.  The book has everything:  Information for the new hobbist, great pictures, and the species section is fantastic.  The book promotes a conscientious look at fish keeping, and for most of us it echos what we all believe.  Wonderful!!  I can not recommend this one high enough!	2005-02-06

The book gives us more about the \\"Lady Vader,\\" and the mystery of the Dark Force fleet.

If you are looking for a deep meanful plot...look somewhere else but if you want a fast, action packed story full of cool locations, this is the one.  I enjoyed this \\"non-thinker\\" more than I want to admit and honestly would love to see a series based on Maul.  He is just to cool of a character to leave cut in half at the bottom of a pit on Naboo.  I'd love to see more stories that take place before his demise.  This one is great fun and worth the time to read.  One down point is that it is hard to get attached to any new characters since they are obviously going to loose.  Neat idea to have the bad guy as the focal point of the story and...WHAT A BAD GUY!!!!	2005-02-06

The girls loved it, the boys loved it, and I loved it.  It is full of great characters and has a wonderful moral.  It is very nice to see a story like this one.  It does not sacrifice plot in order to speak to a younger audience.  I am an adult, and I have read for years and years of my life.  I, honestly, enjoyed it as much as my kids did.  I probably liked it even more because they were so in love with the story.  It makes teaching so much more fun when your students like what they are doing.  I recommend it highly to young and old alike.  P.S.  The story is historically accurate and the setting is prefectly rendered.  It is a history lesson as well.	2005-01-17

Zahn's plot makes perfect sense and fits wonderfully into the Star Wars universe.  The Rebels (now the New Republic) are still mopping up after Endor, and the political climate is difficult as well.  The plot moves wonderfully and leaves the reader craving more.  I love the intirgue and the new characters in this book.  Honestly, what captured me the most was Zahn's perfect protrayal of the core classic characters.  He is right on the money.  One can almost hear them speaking.  It is truly too bad that these books can not be made into films.  The actors are now to aged to do so, and it would not really work.  However, an animated series would be outstanding...especially if Lucas could get the actors to return to protray they own voices. The book is tremendous, and it is just what Star Wars fans will love.  Great battles, inner sturggles, politics, and of course a new super cool villian to strive against.  \\"The force is with this one!\\"	2005-01-17

In the modern age in which we live, it is nice to see that the real purpose of Christ's coming to Earth can be seen in such a simple way.  The children in this book are people you know.

If you expect to be moved or thrilled this is not the book for it.  We do get to see more of Kyle Riker and the purposal of marriage between Riker and Troi, but the book is lacking.  The relationship between Seer and Riker is likely the most interesting part of the novel, but some of the other situations seem absurd.  Why would Kyle Riker do some of the things he does?

UNGODLY is a superb account of the events in the O'Hair's lives.  The book shows an UNBIASED look at these individuals despite what other reviewers have said.  Most atheist reviewers will not like this book because it shows the true nasty nature of Ms. O'Hair.  She was close to a criminal herself with all her tax problems.  She was a hard person to like and was obnoxious beyond normal considerations.  She had utter contempt for Christians and most people in general.  Of course, this in no way excuses her horrible murder.  It may be ironic, but I am not justifying murder.  What I take issue with is that some reviewers have stated that the Christians in the book are portrayed as all good and the atheists are shown to be vile.  I must have read a different book than they did. Certainly some Christians are portrayed as good, but others are portrayed as con-artists.  Some atheists are shown to be kind people of good character while others push forward the gospel of hate.  Some reviewers seem to take issue with any perspective that they disagree with.  I am a Christian, and I have a dear friend who is an atheist.  I feel that he is misguided, and he feels that I am incorrect.  We debate, but we still maintain a mutual respect for one another.  Dracos has shown both sides and told a reasonably accurate account of the O'Hair's lives.  His work is researched to the hilt.  UNGODLY is NOT biased in any way.  Many times throughout the book Dracos portrays Madalyn in a negative light.  He also shows respect for her abilities and empathy for her death.  I have no idea if Dracos is a Christian or not, but in his acknowledgements he thanks Pan and the presiding Gods.  This is tongue in cheek, but as a Christian I personally would not thank Pagan gods even in jest.  I say this to point out that Dracos DOES NOT have some hidden Christian agenda.  He is just giving a compelling account of a tragic yet interesting life.	2004-10-25

The Faded Sun is so rich in plot, location, and prose that those traits alone would make it worth reading.  The story is exciting and full of wonder.  However, the true beauty of this book is in the development of character.  I am sure we have all read works in which we enjoyed the story but could have cared less about the characters.

The series is full of excellent humor and is well worth the effort to acquire and read.  The author has a wonderful wit and a super command of satire. The Myth series centers around a young mage named Skeeve and his mentor and best friend Ahaz.  Ahaz is a money hungry demon from Perv who has lost all of his magical powers.  Ahaz takes it upon himself to teach the fledgling mage all he knows of magic and in the process attempts to gain as much wealth and fame as he can for the young magi and himself. With this fame comes endless chances for adventure.  The book series takes these two, as well as a host of friends, on many misguided and hilarious quests.  I have rarely laughed out loud while reading, but I found myself chuckling constantly as I read this series.  With friends like Tananda the sexy female troll or trollop as they are called and Chumley her very ugly, super smart brother with an English accent and proper manners, the story is a virtual paradise of laughter.  Throw in the very overweight but sweetly dedicated Massha, and a loving but mentally limited pet dragon, and the mix is complete.  This party of individuals gets into and out of all sorts of messes. The story is rich in reference humor as well.  An example of this includes a reference to Elfquest.  While adventuring in one realm the party of friends encounter two werewolves named Ydnew and Drahcir.  Please note the reverse spelling of these two characters.  They are known as the Wolf Writers.  The obvious reference is a friendly nod to WaRP graphics.  Asprin has worked with Richard and Wendy in the past, so this makes even more sense.  In short, the adventures of Skeeve and Ahaz take them many places.  While hilarious, this series does not forget to deal with more serious issues.  In essence, it is a story about growing up.  It is also a story about the wonderful power of friendship.  Morality is constantly important to the series, and Asprin deals with this superbly. The misadventures of the characters in this series are both fun and interesting.  Asprin is able to capture good fun and somehow combine it with serious issues.  Friendship is a major subject in the series as well as loyalty.  The \\"growing pains\\" of young Skeeve remind us all of youth and its difficulties.

After reading Wizard's First Rule, I found myself wondering more about Richard and Kahlan.  The first book went far beyond my expectations, and I was enormously happy with the finished product. Stone of Tears, if anything, has surpassed the first novel in quality.  This monster book, around 1000 pages, is full of all the things I have come to expect from Goodkind.  Strong settings, wonderful characters, and an inventive plot keep the book moving at a blistering speed.  Many people feel that most modern fantasy is derivative, and that is true to some extent.  However, Goodkind has established a wonderful world, a unique slant on how magic works, and some of the best characters to ever grace the page.<br />Stone of Tears takes off with breakneck speed and takes the reader to so many amazing locations that the book almost comes off like a George Lucas visual extravaganza.  I would simply love to see some of the amazing pictures Goodkind has created in my mind on the silver screen.  Yet, the book is so large and the plot so twisting and turning that it would lend itself adapted to a cable TV series better than a movie.  There were times I would look up from my reading only to literally hear the sounds stop and the landscape change.  I was in Goodkind's world and he worked his special brand of magic on me as I read.  These books are not literary giants.  Admittedly they would fall under the \\"pulp\\" category, but they are of such a wonderful quality that I feel almost guilty calling them \\"pulp.\\"  They transcend it.  They are so entertaining that many well read people might regard them as \\"guilty pleasures.\\"  Stone of Tears is truly a pleasure to read.  There are so many situations in the book that could be pointed out, but to take time to do so would make this review far longer than it should be.  Suffice it to say that Stone of Tears is one of those rare novels that draw the reader in completely.  From the dark beasts of the underworld to the war against the Imperial Order, this novel jolts out off the page with unstoppable energy.

Since humanity won the last war by a stroke of luck, they are trying to find a leader that will have the fortitude and skill to win the next war.  They search for these leaders among the children of Earth.  This is where Ender Wiggin comes into play.  It is determined that he might have the ability to be \\"the one\\" that could rise up to defeat the aliens.  The book is all about this discovery.<br />I would not want to give away any of the delicious plot of this incredible novel.  Suffice it to say that it is a dark and sinister work full of suspense.  It is not a book to begin at night in bed unless you plan on getting no sleep.  It is simply impossible to put down.  The premise almost sounds laughable.  Believe me, it isn't.  Card's greatest strength is character development.  If you go into this book expecting typical \\"action\\" you will not get what you are anticipating.  It is not a simple \\"fight the aliens\\" book.  It is full of deep meaning, and it spoke straight to my heart.  I identified with the main characters so much it was scary.  The themes and motifs in this novel stay with you.  It is impossible for this review to do the book justice.  I, honestly, often tell people about it when I am browsing in a bookstore and find another person looking for a novel standing beside me.  I have caused several strangers to by the book because of the praise I give it.  I think everyone should read it.  Even if you do not like science fiction, you would like this book.  It is honestly my second favorite book of ALL TIME, and, trust me, I have read more than your average bookworm.raise I give it.  I think everyone should read it.

I thought I would include part of it as my review.  She responded to me, and it was a real thrill.  See the letter below:<br />Ms. Le Guin,<br />I am a 33 year old school teacher in Edinburg, IL.  I teach English to middle school students. I occasionally teach college composition classes as an adjunct faculty member.  I am also an avid reader and a struggling writer.  I have always believed that in order to write good fiction one has to read a lot of good fiction and a lot of bad fiction.  I have done both.  I began a quest to read all of the Hugo Award winners to give myself an impression of what many consider to be good writing. That is when I discovered your novel THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS.  It was sitting quietly in a used bookstore with a tattered cover and a well-read spine.<br />As I began to read it, I have to admit that at first I wasn't particularly impressed.  It seemed an odd world, and I was having a hard time getting into the story.  This did not last long.  The greatness of the book began to emerge.  I began to read at a quicker pace.  I became so enthralled with the culture you had created that I could think of little else.  You took me to the places that you had fashioned and made me live as one of your characters.  I remember your descriptions of the snow and ice.  I actually felt cold most of the time I read your novel.  Perhaps this degree of identification is unusual, but your work moved me so much that I can only describe it as awe-inspiring.  I truly felt that I was in the presence of a true master.  I cannot say for certain why the book is so wondrous.  I have tried to analyze it many times in my mind.  I am a huge fan of writing reviews but have put off writing one for this novel because I honestly do not know what to say.  Long after the last page was read, I kept thinking about it.  I am still thinking about it today.  It is everything I want to accomplish in a book of my own one day.  It has a timeless quality, and a sort of class that sets it apart from many other works.  The magic of it is that I cannot put my finger on why I like it so much.  I have wasted many hours reading bad books, and I have spent many hours reading books that can only be described as wonders. Yours is among the wondrous.  Yours is beyond them.  The experience of the novel touched my life, and it truly taught me what good character development is.  It taught me what good setting is.  It taught me that no matter what we write about it comes down to humanity.  The problems we all face each day are paramount in our minds.  The solutions, though sometimes out of reach, are what we all strive for.<br />I am sure you have received many letters about your works over the course of your career, but I humbly submit mine.  I felt that I could never put to rest the feelings that THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS evoked from me unless I wrote to thank you personally.  I am glad for the opportunity.  I hope that it does you good to know that you have encouraged a humble teacher to continue to strive to create a story as great and wondrous as yours.  Perhaps one day you will read something of mine and be able to know that you had a hand in my inspiration.  Thank you so very much.of my own one day.

I read it, but honestly was not impressed.  The characters seem wrong somehow.  The story is lame.  The overall plot wasn't something I cared about.  However, it was a fine first attempt of a novel.

The great minotaur has supposedly been betrayed by the knighthood he has grown to respect.  There is a price on his head, and he doesn't know why.  In addition he is being pursued by a group of minotaurs for a dishonorable crime that he supposedly committed during the war.  Being chased by many and wondering why, Kaz does the honorable thing and goes to the knighthood and makes a horrifying discovery.  The minotaur finds himself thrust into feelings of dejavu and discovers a sinister plot that threatens to unravel everything that Huma strove to build.  The plot is rich with great characters that become important to the reader, and the story is exciting with a superbly twisting and changing plot.  Kaz must rise above the persecution and once again embrace the ideals that Huma taught him, and in doing so he becomes more than he ever imagined he could.  While not quite to the level of The Legend of Huma, this book a truly a great read and offers the reader a wonderful opportunity to experience a finely crafted fantasy tale.	2003-10-24

Most of the stories are entertaining short reads.  This review will focus on two of the stories that stand out as the best of the collection.<br /> Night of Falling Stars by Nancy Varian Berberick is an excellent story about a young man, Ryle, that is haunted by the death of his father.  He blames himself for being afraid.  In this tale, he has sworn an oath to himself to never allow fear to rule his heart again.  His true enemy seems to be the fear he has of allowing his terror to cause the death of another.  When a burly dwarf, Tarran, shows up to enlist the young swordsman to help him in a quest of vengeance against a dragon, Ryle's resolve is tested.<br /> This story is excellent and full of uncommon character development.  Ryle is a complex person that has powerful issues to deal with.  Tarran is also a great character with his own past.  A reader will gain a sense of these two while they are treated to a rip-roaring, spine-tingling adventure.  The end leaves one begging for more of Berberick's work.<br /> Another story deals with Richard A. Knaak's famous minotaur, Kaz.  Kaz and the Dragon's Children is a tale written in Knaak's normal, excellent style.  Kaz is portrayed consistently with his sense of minotaur honor and bravery intact.<br /> This tale deals with the ancient past and quiet possibly the first attempt by a mage to dabble in draconian making.  Kaz must pretend to be a servant of the Dark Queen while he tries to figure out a way to free a large silver dragon and liberate her eggs from a powerful dark mage.<br /> The story reminds one of Robert E. Howard's works and the barbarian exploits of Conan.  Kaz is the warrior fearful of magic, to proud to show it, and forced by his own nobility to make an impossible situation right again.  The story resolves in a very unique way and is full of great fight scenes.  Of course, it is always nice to see Kaz in action again.  Knaak does a superb job.<br /> All in all, this collection of short stories makes for many hours of excellent reading.  The authors cover many topics from a draconian bridge building team to a Kender that is magically transformed into a dragon.  It is a fun book that deals with both lighthearted and serious issues.  As editors, Weis and Hickman have assembled delightful collection of short stories that will keep any fan of Dragonlance turning pages until the end.ce to see Kaz in action again.

It chronicles the events of Lord Soth's life after his disappearance from Krynn.  The black knight finds himself ripped from the famed lands of the Dragonlance and deposited into the world of Strad in Ravenloft.  This book is full of great dark characters, and the reader gets to know more about the famed death knight along the way.  The book has it all.  The excitement and superb storytelling make it a fun read.  The characters are richly portrayed and find themselves in exciting fights and difficult situations.  Soth is forced to confront his past.  As his future is left hanging in the balance, the death knight has amazing encounters with every sort of denizen and the confrontations he has with the vampric Lord Strad are the thing of fantasy legend.  All in all this is an excellent read.	2003-10-24

Lowder returns in a dubious paring with Voronica Whitney-Robinson.  I am uncertain what makes this book so bad.  The story has such promise and yet falls so short of the mark that it is almost sickening.<br />This complete tragedy of a novel might have been good if the authors would have focused on Soth.  The reader comes away from the book feeling like nothing was accomplished.  The best character in the novel barely works.  The Bloody Cobbler who is victimized by a stupid name but has the best lines in the entire novel, struggles to save this book from being a total waste of paper.  He fails.  In short, the best part of this novel is the beautiful binding and cover art.  This is definitely one book that you cannot judge by the cover.	2003-10-24

The time is long ages before the events of the original Dragonlance series.  Huma is a simple knight that understands the Oath and the Measure better than some of his more prestigious peers.  It is this knowledge of compassion that compels him to save a lone minotaur, Kaz, from a band of goblins.  The friendship that the two form cause a major transformation of Kaz who eventually embraces the knightly ideals.  The main story of this great novel involves the incursion of the Dark Queen, Takhisis, into the planes of the living.  Huma must rise above his simple upbringing and make a huge difference in the lives of all who dwell on Krynn.  He is aided by Kaz all along the way, and the relationship between the two becomes a life changing event for the minotaur, who once served the forces of evil.  Although the outcome of the story is inevitable, the way Knaak takes us there is superbly done.  The characters are people you care about, and the history is consistent with the original series.  The story provides much background information that readers of the Dragonlance Chronicles have always wondered about.  The novel is a fast paced ride to an exciting and moving ending.	2003-10-24

In this book the reader gets to see the history and culture of the Minotaur people.  Kaz, of course, is there to lead the way in this adventure.  The Minotaur people find themselves in an amazing set of circumstances.  The entire nation seems to be arming for war.  The arena is as busy as it has ever been deciding matters of honor and justice.  It is into this time and land of turmoil that Kaz finds himself pulled.  Kaz merely wants to raise his family and live in peace, but circumstances draw him into action.  There is something hidden and evil hiding among his people.  Kaz makes a discovery that will shake his entire world forever.  This is likely the best book of, what is now being called, \\" The Minotuar Trilogy.\\"  The plot twists and turns, and so captures the reader that it is hard to put down.  These books are a lot of fun, and this one is a fantastic read.  The unexpected ending in worth the entire novel series.	2003-10-24

I have usually been there, read the review, and bought the shirt.  Gimmicks rarely influence me.  However, I thankfully fell victim to this one.  The Sword of Truth series had been out for a long time before I broke down a bought the first paperback.  TOR reissued it with a sneaky $2.99 price tag.  I bought it because it was cheap, and I keep hoping that someone will come along that will write as good as Tolkien.<br />I am very glad I got suckered into this one.  Goodkind is in no way as good as Tolkien, but I have to admit he is at the top of the list for modern fantasy writers.  I was very impressed by the way he handled the characters, and the story itself is well crafted.  I did find an inexcusable amount of typos in this edition, but that is just me being my editing self. The setting is fantastic, his descriptions are amazing, and I actually felt for the characters.  When any author makes me feel something weather it be excitement, lust, or mortal terror, I sit up a take notice.<br />Wizard?s First Rule is such a tour de force that I found myself hooked almost immediately.  I went into the novel trying to dislike it.  I looked for Tolkien rip-offs and found a few, but somehow I got past them.  I believe it was the story quality itself.  The ideas are original, and the strength of character development is simply flawless.  For a first novel, Goodkind has produced a work that many seasoned writers would be proud of.  I read more and got deeper and deeper into the story.  The ending did not disappoint me either.  Goodkind brings this monster of a book to a close with a wallop that I will be thinking about for days.<br />I have stayed away from the plot entirely in this article because it is just too good to give away.  The exploits of Richard and Kahlan are what fantasy is all about.  The book also has a bad guy that gives one the shivers.  He is uncommon to say the least.  The scope of the story is huge.  My edition is close to 900 pages but it is worth every word.  It has everything from fantastic fight scenes to love story elements.  I went out and bought the second book in the series.  There are 8 books in the series now as well as a short story.  I would have reviewed them all together, but they are simply too large to do justice to in one article.  If you love sweeping and very original fantasy you should check out Goodkind? It is the \\"good\\" and \\"kind\\" thing to do for yourself.ge.

The power of the story lies in the ideas it conveys. The Ring itself overshadows the characters in the novel. I really didn't care about any of them except for Speaker. They were simple vehicles to get me into the ring so I could explore the unique idea Niven presents. It is truly a classic, but were it written today in 2003, I doubt it would capture the Hugo or Nebula. I give homage to the ideas presented but find a lot of the book honestly flat. The setting so overpowered the characters that the find myself remembering the \\"look\\" of the world more than the \\"problems\\" of the characters. All in all, I am gald I read it but will probably never re-read it.	2003-07-19
