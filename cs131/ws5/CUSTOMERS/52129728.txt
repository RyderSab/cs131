US	52129728	R35J5G51S5OQHK	0521644895	697973464	Engines: An Introduction	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Best as a textbook, but still interesting otherwise	This slim volume is for engineering students, complete with end-of-chapter problems, but is nonetheless readable, or at least skimmable, from cover to cover for those with an interest in engines. The writing is concise but not dry, with the author recounting his personal experiences with ruined VW engines. It has a sense of history, considering the 3.4L Jaguar engine first used in 1948 sufficiently modern to use as a benchmark to measure the late-Nineties Daihatsu against.<br />Some later sections run to several pages of calculations, so you won't read everything, but you'll still get a good  qualitative understanding due to the author's own command of the subject.	2005-10-05

Then separate chapters focus on FWD, RWD, AWD and end with a look back on some modern landmark designs, like the Jaguar E-type or the VW Rabbit.<br /><br />We learn struts and double wishbone are the two choices up front; the rear adds multilink and torsion beam. Nowadays independent rear suspensions are the norm, the last solid axle design being the Saab 9000. And the wide tires and mid-engine designs, while fine for powerful Formula One cars, mean little elsewhere.<br /><br />Like his other books, the writing is engaging and informal, and is intended for a British audience, only adding to its charm.	2005-09-10

Best part: a section after each chapter with technical questions sent in by owners over the years. It provides insights into these cars (less reliable than you think), their owners (about as wealthy and as particular as you think), and serves as a history of the US models since the Sixties.	2005-06-13

And of course there's the story itself,  beginning in the era when Democracies were replacing Monarchies, the 18th Century, and ending in the US around the First World War, when the instrument began its abrupt decline, using old newspapers, magazine articles, publishers' catalogs, etc., as sources, translated as needed by the author.<br /><br />We learn of the influential Germans, who nurtured the instrument's development in the beginning, took a back seat to the English and French for a while, then regained the lead in the latter half of the 19th century as they became an industrialized nation, and the origins of Classical music--that is, the performance of dead composers' works--which replaced the usual practice of concert performers playing variations of well-known grand opera tunes when that died out as Liszt and others fled for their lives during the Second French Revolution of 1848.<br /><br />The story ends in the US. In the later 19th Century, the piano was the focus for entertainment in the Victorian home and  popular sheet music sold millions of copies--but changing culture, as much as technology, soon doomed the instrument.<br /><br />In all, a tale of music's role in modern Western society told effortlessly by someone who's spent a lifetime gathering the facts.	2005-03-17

It provides a foundation-to-finish review of the homebuilding process, showing where to save money at every step. Sometimes this means finding areas that are overbuilt--here you'll have to carefully consider which suggestions to use--but often it means using the latest technological advances, and this is what makes the book unique. It presents the most up-to-date products available from your local ready-mix supplier alongside the newest framing connectors or plumbing fixtures.

It's about 10% piano, 90& human interest, telling the stories of a couple dozen characters encountered during a year as a beginning piano student. There's the computer course, the week long piano camp, the lessons from the Mountain Man and the Socialite, interwoven with anecdotes of Glenn Gould, Robert Schumann and other notables.

At least if interpreted by someone with a consumate knowledge of Toledo history, like the author. Beginning with the city's origins as a transportation nexus in the canal and  railroad eras, continuing through its emergence as a manufacturing hub at the dawn of the automobile age, and ending with the Postwar struggle against economic decline, this three-book series lets pictures tell the story. Each volume has hundreds of photos with captions that concisely describe this vanished world with fascinating anecdotes and occasional dry wit.	2004-12-19

The problem is, the accompanying text adds nothing--e.g. lower your home cost by eliminating the basement. Isn't this obvious? There's very little information in here, and what there is reveals only a vague understanding of how houses are built and what things cost.	2004-08-11

Much more convincing than the usual catalog with commentary.	2004-07-25

The writing is as careful as the original, and as economical, so you have to master the early chapters or the rest is hopeless, as things start off slowly but quickly become difficult. It begins by considering the error in a single measurement, and proceeds to estimating errors derived from curve fitting. A few nuclear decay experiments provide examples throughout, and the author insists on calculating many quantities manually, even though in practice it would never be done that way. Some background topics like matrix algebra appear in the appendix too.	2004-07-25

The text is from several authors, so some advice is occasionally repeated. Repetitio est mater studiorum, as they say.<br /><br />There's detailed instructions on simple walls, layout advice for maintaining the bond around openings, coverage of advanced topics like arches and corbelling, and background topics such as brick manufacture. All in metric and referenced to British building codes by the way.	2004-07-24

Maybe there's just not as much to say about wood compared to steel, glass, concrete or masonry; maybe the technology is not as extensive.<br />The structural section makes no effort to tutor, so will only be understandable by engineers. But if you want, you'll easily be able to build a wooden railroad bridge using the information here, so sophisticated and exhaustive is the coverage. (It has nothing in particular to say about residential construction, by the way, although several houses appear in the examples, which represent about half the book.)<br />The wood science section is good but too short; there's no building science section at all. The presentation is like others in the series, but adds color to the examples, unlike them. Some complaints, but overall an excellent book.	2004-05-31

He also chose his subjects well, with many less-well-known examples and only a few icons. As a historian, he occasionaly suffers from their tendency to document, say, the names and ruling periods of the Middle Ages Persian kings before getting to the interesting parts about the use of brick in that era. The photographs are all similar to the one on the cover--deep colors and bright sunlight--and their consistency adds a nice touch. The organization of the book was good too, presenting the subject in manageable bites.	2004-05-18

As an artist, and not an academic, his approach is informal and slightly irreverent.<br /><br />The book's emphasis is on the Colonial era, whose styles he divides into  New England, Hudson River, Mid-Atlantic, Chesapeake, Southern, French and Spanish. He then sums up the 19th century styles, predominantly Greek Revival, Italianate, Queen Anne and other late Victorian styles, and ends with the Colonial Revival, Bungalow, and Prairie styles (originated in Illinois, the Prairie State).<br /><br />He points out some styles were revived exclusively for the mansions of the turn-of-the-century industrial barons. He has not much to say about more recent houses, only mentioning the International Style, but overall it is still a good book.	2004-04-09

It's as  readable as a magazine article but more substantial. The author easily explains the engineering principles involved in suspension, brakes, steering, and so on, then describes the current state of the art, and finally offers a glimpse into the future (individual electric motors for steering, brakes, AC, even valves).

Here he describes the groundskeepers' homes on large estates, and the later workers' cottages built by large companies, that started this category. The rest, however, is the standard thou-shalt-covet-thy-neighbor's-house pictures of very recent, attention-grabbing, expensive, glass-crazy fashion statements.	2004-04-09

This entertaining chronology of non-racing engine development, organized by era, country (often European) and company, discusses hundreds of engines--most of which are long forgotten, so some skimming is allowed--in terms of bore and stroke, valve and camshaft placement, etc., in a very easy to read style. There are also tales of good engineering which did not prevail, due to, for example, British tax laws based on piston area instead of displacement, or the Twenties' inexplicable clamoring for straight eights over the superior vee configuration.<br />A lot of history is passed along. Cadillac always built V8s, Buick always OHVs. Hemispherical combustion chambers go back to the Thirties. Most of the engines I was curious about were included: VW Beetle and Golf, Citroen DS 21, 12-valve Accord. It ends by discussing  the trends towards multivalve engines and variable valve timing, and is overall a very skillfully written reference book.	2004-02-25

Typical reader might be an architect or builder--someone who needs to know how to lay out window and door dimensions to accomodate brick construction, although, with its many color pictures, it may also be of interest to anyone who admires brick construction.

The first few chapters contain a lot of interesting and detailed history, but the emphasis eventually turns to restoring windows, doors, floors, wallpaper, and so on, to genuine Georgian.<br />The author scoffs at the readily available low-cost reproductions, often pointing out their inaccuracies--pure white was never used for windows, for instance--but then again, what do you expect from a book with a Forward by the Queen of England? Abundant photos accompany the text, fully justifying the book's price.	2004-02-11

The majority of homes are Tudor or Old English, like the ones on the cover, with just a few Colonials and Bungalows mixed in.

It discusses all of Modernism in the Twenties and Thirties, not just Art Deco, including Rietveld-Schroder and Villa Savoy among the Deco houses. It gives the context of the famous \\"machines for living\\" quote, often used as a rallying cry of the anti-Modernists, but which actually only refers to the thermostatically-controlled central heating, hot and cold running water, and other conveniences that were new back then.<br />The author talks about the personalities, events and the Jazz Age itself as much as the houses, explaining the style had none of the intellectual seriousness of the International Style, was usually very expensive, and was never big in Britain.<br />It's a very substantive book, full of interesting pictures, from an extremely knowledgeable and charming author.	2004-02-07

I was disappointed to see the illustrations, once a highlight, have suffered a little since the last edition, and that some advanced topics like valve jobs and turbo repair are gone. Previous editions seemed to offer an alternative in a crowded field of similar books, aimed at those who already know how to do the basic jobs, but this last has been dumbed down and joked up, just another ... for Dummies title.	2004-01-14

On the other hand, if it's presented too briefly, it becomes an impossible-to-remember chronology of unrelated buildings. This book, though, presents it in just the right depth, using an effortless and light writing style. Greek temples, the author points out, show \\"no hint of a way to get in\\".<br />Thus begins a story that, to paraphrase him, is complicated and impossible to simplify. Fortunately he explains it well: Romanesque is, in a way, the first Renaissance, as Charlemagne tries to associate his empire with Imperial Rome. The actual Renaissance is a transitional point because, for the first time, architecture is based on scholarship; this continues until the 19th century, as new archeological discoveries (early Doric columns had no bases) add to the repertoire.<br />And he claims that a totally unknown Modern architect is on a par with Wright, showing he's confident enough in the subject to think for himself.	2003-12-21

It follows their proven formula and maintains their exemplary look. This one is slanted toward traditional styles--Cape, Spanish Colonial, Greek Revival, Craftsman--giving an example of each, then discussing its architectural features in an easy-to-read style that assumes no prior knowledge. There's the obligatory Eight Rules of Good Houses, which oddly seem to always require expensive materials used in expensive custom designs.

This being a European book, there's far more coverage of various types of roofs, with the asphalt shingles that are ubiquitous in the US being but one of many options. Even thatched roofs are covered. There's an extended section on structural requirements, and even a mention of historical methods, using hammer beams, for example. But it's the building science section that stands out. This is covered to some degree in all the books in the Construction Manual series, but the concepts of heat flow, moisture control, etc., are explained at great length here. Practical guidelines are given based on the European building codes, and construction details abound. The translation to British English (e.g. roof sarking) is well-done and the book design and paper quality are every bit as good as the excellent and highly technical content.	2003-12-01

The photos, although good, are not top quality. There are lots of construction drawings, in a separate section (forcing a lot of flipping back and forth, BTW), but they were not redone for the book, are tiny reproductions of the originals, so not too readable. You usually at least get a floor plan, and some rough sketches in the text section, but the point of the book is not to explain how these buildings are built.<br />The worst aspect is the commentary by the two authors, mere filler material. The best are the words of the architect himself, who can offer background on all his projects, and who comes across as very sincere.	2003-11-15

I was surprised to find it more intelligent than the competition. And I was  put off by the title, thinking the book was only about those things that make a house a work of old-fashioned craftmanship. But it's a complete tour of the housebuilding process, seemingly written from memory, so easily do the words flow.<br />He shares his opinions, and they're always sensible. Mostly he eschews the cheap stuff, and telling you *what that is* is  invaluable. He prefers plywood to OSB, wood to vinyl siding, and steers you away from roof trusses, vinyl windows, wooden countertops (not cheap, but not practical), and fiberglass tubs. He tells you where to install thicker plywood or wallboard, and tries to talk you into a real masonry chimney instead of a metal lined firebox. His style is succinct, never offensive, and witty.

( Twentieth Edition )	Books	5	20	20	N	Y	Full of historical detail	Mine is a new 1975 edition (which was a small fraction of the new price). It is as much a history of the world--and an incredibly detailed one--as a history of architecture. It opens each of its 40 chapters with a discussion of a civilization or era, then describes the buildings very matter-of-factly. Sometimes opinions emerge: Louis Kahn is cited as an example of a flash-in-the-pan; FLLW's Guggenheim is criticized as impractical.<br /><br />The photos are top quality B/W, often very old. Its real strength is early architecture; by chapter 35, it is only finishing up the Renaissance. The authors are so knowledgeable, the writing so polished after 18 editions, all others pale by comparison.<br /><br />I don't think there's much of a market for these books outside of libraries, but those who read it will marvel at its erudition.	2003-10-17

What a joy to look at these quaint medieval-inspired houses. Lots of them, and all those turrets! You won't find mention of this phenomenon in any of the popular books on house styles, and the author deserves credit for documenting it.<br />The book displays a professional knowledge of architecture, unlike many in this category which seem to be written by art historians, and you can rest assured the author will not confuse a mullion with a muntin, or claim, as another one once did, that Tudor is an early Rennaissance style. (Although he happens to be incorrect in saying &quot;terra cotta&quot; means &quot;hollow tile&quot;; it means &quot;baked earth&quot;.)<br />No vacant catalog-esque prose here; the author knows his subject and enjoys telling others about it.	2003-10-09

It differs from the Concrete and Masonry versions, which lean more towards a summary of the building codes, and the Glass version, which goes on at length about solar effects, in its more lengthy review of the engineering basics involved. (But perhaps the subject lends itself to this approach, being more specialized.) The text is also the easiest to read of all the books, more than compensating for the lack of color pictures anywhere. The middle technical section covers the subject in a very orderly way, beginning with the structural properties of small components and proceeding on to the assembled skyscraper. The last sections will leave you scratching your head unless you're a structural engineer though.<br /><br />There is also a section on construction practices, where you might be reminded to leave an inch or two of space under your column base plates to allow for construction tolerances, and to use special expanding grout for filling it instead of mortar or concrete, which would shrink on curing and provide opportunities for water to get in. Or to try to achieve equal compression in all your columns, so settling will be uniform.<br /><br />Surprisingly enjoyable, and not used in the other books but maybe not possible there, owing to their extensive excerpting of tables from building codes, is the way the text does not normally keep referring you to figures, but allows you to read uninterrupted. The figures are there, as in the other books, but they have more extensive captions which allow them to stand alone and be read in parallel with the main text.<br /><br />Like the other books in the series, there are no equations to speak of, or very few. Just an attempt to explain all the relevant principles in a qualitative way and to demonstrate their use with hundreds of meticulous drawings.	2003-10-08

Worst part is its premise: that once we understand the importance of adaptability in buildings, we will build differently.<br />The fact remains building owners will never pay more than is necessary to meet their forseeable needs. (And if it weren't for building codes, even health and safety would be compromised.)<br />Another point: Although he values ordinary buildings, and wants an architecture free of pretense, pretense of some sort is the essence of architecture, which, as Frank Lloyd Wright said, begins where function ends. Do we really want a world of plain utilitarian structures?<br />So the book ends up being more of a criticism of our short-sighted culture, using buildings as examples. The arguments may not hold water, but the vast amount of research that obviously went into this book to document how buildings change over the decades still makes it interesting.	2003-10-05

And she certainly writes like it, tossing in obscure words--argot, benighted--with ease. But it's her self-deprecating sense of humor that makes the book, and she's good for a chuckle every few pages.<br />She is an apologist for the group as a whole. She reserves her criticism for the American Iron riders, observing their interest in \\"freedom\\" rarely goes beyond loutish behavior, and chronicles the many slights suffered by female riders.<br />Her interspersed chapters on motorcycle history are interesting, and makes me wonder whether cyclists, with their gangs, riding groups, events, etc., contrary to the stereotype, are not the most *social* creatures on the planet.	2003-09-12

It consists of photo spreads of several homes by the architect author, with explanatory text. It's much more focused than similar books, but, like them, uses polished professional photography and ghost writing.<br />The theme is houses with Picturesque charm, or at least as much as can be had with new construction. I feel true charm is always accidental and only accrues over time, but, for those who feel instant charm is better than none at all, there are no better examples. At least for modern homes. Otherwise, Storybook Style: America's Whimsical Homes of the Twenties takes the cake.	2003-08-31

Everything needed to analyze a building's energy budget--at least for the German climate--is presented and well explained, as is daylighting. Atria and double leaf facades are discussed at the end to summarize the principles. There is also a comprehensive section on the mechanical properties of glass: resistance to wind loads, how to attach it, etc.<br />Only downside is the quality of the translation (I assume), which results in an occasional unusual sentence: &quot;As no energy can be lost from the total system, the balance of the incident energy must be able to be resolved mathematically.&quot;<br />Nothing that impairs understanding though.	2003-08-31

Because this one concerns masonry, the most general purpose of building materials, it seems to cover all aspects of building science--energy efficiency, moisture and sound control, fire safety (very briefly) etc.  It also gives basic overall structural engineering guidelines, e.g. allowable dimensions for unsupported walls, and more, for the reader who is already conversant with stresses, shear forces, and so on, and who is interested in reading several pages on, say, how to interpret cracks in walls.<br />Apart from the historical overview which begins it, it is essentially a summary and explanation of the German building codes, and supplies voluminous data from them in the form of tables and graphs.  And, of course, it ends with the detailed examples, with meticulous drawings, for which the publisher is famous.	2003-08-12

The houses themselves often follow a formula: nothing ordinary, or novelty for its own sake. There are many examples of extreme creativity unconstrained by common sense, but, then again, such things make for interesting reading. As long as *I* don't have to have a plywood floor in my house :-)<br />This version of the Good Life is remarkably consistent from article to article, and you may grow a little tired of people bragging about the features of their house that are &quot;for entertaining&quot;. But, if you don't mind sorting the wheat from the chaff, there are also lots of attractive homes, offering an alternative to standard housing development fare.	2003-08-12

The author has several automotive books to his credit and it shows. In his history of this classic car, told from a British perspective, the text is easy to read, and the author displays a thorough understanding of how cars work. There are plenty of excellent photos, some in color but mostly not. I learned *why* the ignition key is on the floor (safety feature), and got  further insights into this small company's heritage as an innovator, e.g. how, with the 96, they had an extremely aerodynamic car rivalled only by the Citroen DS, or how they insisted, for safety reasons, on using heavier sheet metal than other makers, explaining its enduring status among automotive brands.	2003-08-12

It also covers military equipment going back to the early days. It brings together a wealth of hard-to-find information and the author is very definitely an authority on the subject.

The basic format for all the books is the same--history, followed by science and engineering, followed by examples. In this book, the technical section emphasizes structural matters, with a large chapter on precast construction. There's nothing on reinforcement requirements because they're covered in building codes. Shell structures are discussed, and another chapter covers surface finishes.  The translation to English is OK but lacks the nuances that make for pleasant reading.<br />Too bad there is nothing for the US architect of this quality, because all the technical references are to German or European standards.  But they're educational nonetheless.	2003-05-29

Which is just one of many fascinating facts contained inside this look at the the most expensive of fashion statements. It especially focuses on Western European architecture from about the Rennaissance on, when architecture as a profession began, although Classical and Gothic are covered because they are, after all, the models for all that followed. But it's no textbook chronology of well-known buildings.<br />Instead it's an essay on society and its buildings, by someone knowledgeable enough to be able to toss in a new fact about all the familiar names. (Although his claim that the extra glass in the Reitveldt Schroder house required an industrial boiler that cost as much the house itself is a little hard to believe.)<br />The writing is witty, full of good stories, and avoids the cliches often found in these books. Even manages references to recent movies, like Fight Club (the character's excessive brand consciousness) and Amelie (showcases the venerable Art Nouveau subway stations).	2003-05-11

And uncovers some interesting facts from deep within the Citroen archives and interviews with the principals.

That is, if you're interested in ultra modern architect designed houses. The competition is The New American House series, which is mostly pictures, and the Taunton Press books, which unfortunately add insipid text. What makes this book stand out is its excellent design, and plans, sections and elevations for every entry.  Something that could only have been gotten from access to the original construction documents. There's a companion essay for each house. True, it's ultimately nonsense, but it's well considered and articulate nonsense, as the author, a former architectural magazine editor, knows his history.	2003-03-04

(Had no trouble getting one though.) This book is based on a series of magazine articles for Old Home Journal, so the style is informal. The carefully chosen color pictures set it apart from its competition, A Field Guide to American Houses, by the other husband and wife team. But mostly it's the authors' ability to explain in simple language the events that caused the rise and fall of the various styles: the switch to stud framing, the widely circulated pattern books, the Arts and Craft movement, World War I and the various European styles brought home by the soldiers, etc.	2003-02-24

Although there's plenty of evidence one cannot time the market short term--just look at managed portfolios compared to major stock indexes--that does not mean it's not possible over much longer cycles. The usual metric, P/E ratio, for measuring these cycles is occasionally wrong, like once or twice a century, e.g. if earnings are unusually small, as in the Depression. Better to use something similar to price-to-book value, \\"q\\". Averaging over all companies, and looking back over the last hundred years of market data, q tells you when stocks are overpriced more reliably than P/E. If you buy stocks at below average q and sell them when q is above average, you'll outperform a buy and hold strategy.<br /><br />Of course, people already ignoring P/E are unlikely to be swayed by a refinement. That's why the second aspect of this book is important. It's one of few books that tells you *not* to own stocks now. It presents historical data--someone unfortunate enough to have entered the market just before the 1929 crash would have had to wait 25 years to catch up with an all bond portfolio--to show how bad an investment stocks can be.<br /><br />Holding bonds until P/E returns to single digits, where it was at the start of the bull market in 1982, will never appeal to some people, but that's this book's advice in a nutshell.	2003-02-22

It's impossible to separate the evolution of these houses from the changes in the city itself, so some history is inevitable; there is also a great amount of detail involving the lives of the owners and developers. If you are not overwhelmed by all this, you will uncover some interesting bits: the ads for Formstone, the fact that basements were hand-dug by a crew of nine in two days, the tales of the \\"night soil\\" removers.

A lot of research went into this book, and the result is more of a reference than something you'd want to read straight through. The early chapter on massing comes to mind--which probably should be an appendix anyway. All the lesser styles are included for completeness, but including them makes the big picture harder to see. On the good side, there's lots and lots of B/W pictures, which really tell the story anyway. If you're willing to sacrifice comprehensive coverage, House Styles in America by James C.

Much of the book seems to be anecdotes about this \\"friend\\" who had this \\"absolute nightmare\\" building a home and how that proves that \\"you should always get it in writing\\" or something equally prosaic. They will misinform you that anchor bolts--in every house--are only required in earthquake zones and that the concrete compressive strength rating, e.g. 3000 psi, refers to its *weight*. In other words, know little about how houses are actually built, and so have exaggerated fears about what might go wrong.

The illustrator gets equal billing, and it's well-deserved, as the drawings alone are worth the price of the book. The best part is on design. I've never seen a book that allowed you to figure loads and size columns, or provided a worksheet to calculate heating requirements. The final section on construction is more of an overview but the important issues are always addressed. You'll need to supplement your reading, especially since newer technologies--housewrap, truss roofs, engineered lumber--are not covered, but everything in this book is useful.	2003-01-27

It's rare to find an architect who can explain things in such a conversational way. The underlying principles are always laid out, first for a small building and then for a large one, to show the effects of changing scale. For example as the surface area to volume ratio changes, so do heating and cooling demands. And for me it was educational to see the British way of building houses: floor joists over concrete slabs, or brick basements. I learned the dew point drops gradually toward the exterior inside porous materials, and 15 deg east of south is the optimum solar orientation in the Northern hemisphere. And the slogan of the man who invented the revolving door (\\"It's always closed.\\")<br />The second half of the book covers building services--heating, plumbing etc.--concisely, and it becomes apparent the author has plenty of real world experience and is no mere academic. Lighting, acoustics and fire safety finish the book. Even at 20 years old, still educational.	2003-01-06

Spends much of each house's description on the arrangement of rooms, which is difficult to follow without the diagram that was meant to go with it.

There might be one or two actual pictures of the complete houses, but they're not especially flattering. Makes you appreciate professional photographers. No technical info either. There is an interview at the end, however, if you're willing to buy the book for that.	2002-12-20

And how could it not? How many famous architects built mostly houses? Or started a commune during the Depression?  Or had elaborate, futuristic, monorail-equipped cities all planned out in complete detail?<br />Profiles the iconoclastic artist a bit too sympathetically at times, though. For instance crediting him with setting the example for the Postwar ranch house, which would have undoubtedly emerged on its own. He also defends FLLW's writings as well as anyone could, but they're really too old fashioned to mean much today.<br />The drawings--just small floor plans--are nice but no details are included. Otherwise, plenty of substance.	2002-12-04

Unless you're desperate for this information--and I don't see why anyone would be; there's lots of FLW books--be aware that you're only getting about a dozen color pics and a brief accompanying story.

Each chapter begins with a summary that's authoritative but friendly. And interesting. You'll learn, for example, that the trick to making a hydraulic cement is to add some siliceous mineral to the limestone before firing in a kiln. The Romans used volcanic rock; modern Portland cement producers find it in certain clays. You'll realize none of these materials can stand up to water, which eventually returns them to their more chemically stable states, changing concrete into limestone, smelted metals back to ores (rust), and turning wood into food for other living things.<br />What follows the introductory discussion is probably too technical for non-professionals--references to ASTM standards, specifications for water jet delivery in gallons per minute and PSI when cleaning stone, and tips for making your own epoxy using bulk chemicals, complete with Dow Chemical part numbers.<br />I was a little disappointed by the presentation--B/W photos by the author and very basic drawings--but I suppose that's all that's needed for a book like this.	2002-11-07

It is a complete but non-technical photo essay with the obligitory highbrow analysis. We don't know what the roof is made of, for example, or how the house was constructed, or where he got those steel casement windows. We do know he just saw a For Sale sign while walking through this neighborhood one day, and now it's his personal museum, full of his collected artifacts, which he hopes to turn over to a foundation someday. His inimitable style is everywhere, and makes for pleasant page turning.<br /><br />Most of the pics are of the interior and are in B/W. However floor plans and elevations appear at the end.	2002-11-02

Then he goes on to identify the events that caused the various styles--the War of 1812 that stopped our imitation of English architecture, the change to stud framing and the effects of industrialization that mark the Victorian era, the nationalistic spirit of the 1876 Centennial that spawned the revival in Colonial archictecture at the end of the 19th century, etc.--in such a professional style of writing you'd never suspect he was also an architect. A history professor maybe. All of which explains the subject better than the usual bare chronological sequence.<br /><br />What helps in a book like this are the odd bits of information casually thrown out that show mastery of the subject.<br />Colonial homes were never white; Greek Revival were never anything but. A particular cornice is usually done incorrectly, compared to the true Classical version.<br /><br />He also make the sensible point that you can only compare styles within limits, that at some point you're really discussing altogether different building types, as in ranches, bungalows, and certainly octagon houses. And early on he boasts he can design a modern four bedroom house in any style. Then he proceeds to do it, providing a front elevation and a repeating ground floor plan (front: LR, center hall, DR. rear: family room, kitchen, mud room) with added porch, tower, fireplace, chimney, as needed. Not so much to explain the architectural features, I think, but to give the prospective homebuilder something that actually could be built today.<br /><br />Where most authors stop around WWII, he continues up to the present. His next-to-last chapter shows the recent builder's styles which will be familiar to anyone who's driven through any of those \\"Vinyl Village\\" developments with the Olde English names: the Townes, Pointes, Glenns, and Harbours. Here he doesn't hesitate to criticize the tastless examples, and continues his tirade into last chapter, where he argues against the Post-Modern assault on tradition in favor of a return to order and careful design.chapter, where he argues against the Post-Modern assault on tradition in favor of a return to order and careful design.	2002-10-21

Nothing you're likely to be able to afford, of course, but the pleasant commentary and artfully composed photographs will carry you away to a wonderful world of make-believe.<br /><br />You'll learn why wealthy folks prefer large but impersonal homes, why an open floor plan makes rooms *seem* larger, no doubt helped by the fact that they actually *are* larger. See why the styles shown in these pages will never be as outdated and amusing as a boomerang coffee table. Plus, why it's OK to build a 4000 sq ft one-bedroom home--as long as that's what \\"suits your lifestyle\\".<br /><br />Just kidding of course.

I liked these books when I first read them, about a year ago, but, having read much since, now find them lightweight.

The author explains how each new wallpaper style, or window treatment, or ceiling ornament, and so on, is a consequence of this Paris Exhibition, or that widely circulated pattern book, or the writings of this influential person.<br />And considerable research and effort went into the book. In addition to the pictures, which cover subjects in Britain, America, and occasionally Australia, there are cutaway drawings showing construction of masonry and wood houses, and, at the close of every chapter, a page or two of drawings to illustrate typical ballusters, wall lamps, wardrobes, etc.<br />It was written for an American audience, going by the spellings and the list of suppliers in the appendix, by an Englishman, who occasionally gets things wrong. Like saying that at the turn of the century porches fell out of favor here and were replaced by conservatories. But his advice on restoration is always good.<br />Although it's an engaging history of the era, it's not a how-to book. The final chapter on repairs is familair material, although it might contain something you've not seen before: sample floor plans for a typical basement or attic conversions.	2002-10-10

The author  describes things he has personally done hundreds of times, so the writing is very clear. But many project photos, and the vast archive of Fine Homebuilding magazine pictures, are used to augment the written procedures, which removes any possible confusion.<br />On the downside, the houses look like mobile homes, and the building science is a little questionable in places, like using a drywall panel resting on the ceiling joists as an attic access, or suggesting insulation as protection against drafts coming through the framing. Nothing drastic though.<br />Overall, step-by-step instruction for framing, including windows and doors, asphalt roofing, vinyl siding, drywall, simple decks, interior trim, basic cabinets and painting.

The technical history of watches is thoroughly covered, the various outdated watch mechanisms--verge, fusee, cylinder escapement--are explained, and interesting footnotes are included, like the wage records from a 19th century watch shop. A chapter on repair will get you started, and even tell you how to restore the blueing on the watch hands (heat them in a tray over an alcohol lamp).

I was disappointed.<br /><br />And then, on page 18, \\"The decorative elaboration can easily blind us to the imagination and discipline with which Macintosh's ideas were grounded in responses to patterns of use, and proved an embarassment to later critics.\\"<br /><br />Not my kind of book I'm afraid. Don't want to unravel all those sentences.<br /><br />Still, the pictures are nice, as is the overall design.

The best book on the topic I've seen, because the author explains in simple terms concepts that many builders--and even architects--often get wrong. It's purely qualitative though; you won't find tables of R values, for instance. Full of useful detail drawings that illustrate the topics--you'll see variations for vinyl/aluminum and wood siding, and brick veneers--and are ready to apply directly to your house plans.	2002-07-16

Written seemingly entirely from memory, you'll understand and remember every word. The author skips the commonly available info and writes about the crucial nuts-and-bolts problems of building a house: what do you do if you've drilled a hundred foot well and come up dry? (Keep drilling.) His advice on some details, vapor barriers for example, is OK but you'll want to check the latest thinking on the topic too. Some harmless misinformation is passed along, like that Palladio, eponym for those short-tall-short windows, \\"invented\\" them. (He may have invented residential architecture, but those windows date to antiquity. In his day they were known as serliana, after the architect Sebastiano Serlio.) The scientific explanations fall a bit short, and the chapter where he disparages Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's engineering does not show him in a good light. However he does caution you that drywallers, more than any other trade, will try to rip you off with a high materials estimate. Stuff like that you can't get anywhere else.	2002-07-05

Written by an architect / syndicated columnist for prospective homebuyers. Shows how to succeed armed only with your checkbook and a phalanx of experts, including your own \\"building inspector\\" to check the other building inspector. One drawback: as a result of the author being so well-read, and maybe not so \\"hands-on\\", everything that could possibly affect this purchase is covered, no matter how minor. So after selecting a builder (avoiding those who don't think much of architects), interviewing the site superintendent, as well as the developer's banker (how you get his number, or what you say to him once you get him on the phone, is anybody's guess), and going through the motions of preparing dinner in the model kitchen, to make sure it's big enough, don't forget to flush the second floor toilets and check the noise they make downstairs, since if you don't like what you hear presumably you must be prepared to start the whole process over again. I suppose it's good to itemize all these things and let the reader decide what to ignore, but it would be better to edit them to help the reader understand what is important. Also, a good portion of the book covers familiar territory: designing your house to suit your \\"lifestyle\\", carpeting vs. wood. vs. tile, etc.<br />This is also the only book I've seen that discouraged acting as your own general contractor. What's funny is, as proof, the author offers an anecdote of another architect who, even after building an extravagant home (4500 sq ft) with bottom-of-the-barrel subs (brags of having to get up to 20 bids to get a 'reasonable' price), complains that it was so stressful that, geez, if it weren't for the $100,000 he saved, he'd never have done it. This is meant to discourage me?<br />Anyway, a very thorough book.	2002-06-03

This book almost describes how to build a 1940's house, with references to plank subfloors, counterweighted sashes, asphalt siding, etc. Even the writing sounds old, as from another era. Newer information is conspicuously tacked on, and an updated chapter by a different author is clumsily written. Too bad. Kind of ruins what was, in its day, probably a pretty good book.<br />Anyway, the author's clear writing makes it enjoyable to read, so a beginner would probably still learn a lot.	2001-10-28
