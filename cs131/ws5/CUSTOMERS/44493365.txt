Actually, as long as you're not too much of a prude, you'll probably find this book's incessant sex and violence kind of funny, and definately entertaining.<br />However, unlike other books of this ilk (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Naked Lunch) don't expect any sort of deeper meaning or a unique look at life in today's world.  Don't expect any meaning at all really.  Just be prepared to chuckle.	2002-12-10

I bought the wrong book.  After reading this book cover to cover, however, I can say I was entertained and did learn some interesting facts.<br />The book never really gets that in-depth in to WHY these people comit the crimes they comitted.  It is also a little too light-hearted in places in dealing with a distasteful topic.  I would have preferred a much more respectful approach to the topic.<br />This book IS entertaining as a light read on an airplane or something like that, but there are other books on this subject that would be vastly more interesting to the discerning reader looking to learn something about serial killers.	2002-12-05

Characters start to seem similar, plots seem somewhat stale and recycled and an overall sense of deja-vu tends to overrun the work. Chuck Palahniuk, when he wrote this book, was in a little bit of a rut.<br />First off, it seems as though most off his leading female characters are begining to seem a little bit like Marla from Fight Club.  His writing style is much the same in this book as in Fight Club but it seems, at times, as though the narrators of both Fight Club and Survivor are the same person in different situations.<br />Overall, however, the plot and the story were great.  It is very funny in places and offers a very unique view of the world, as does all of Palahniuk's books.  If you've never read one of Chuck's books before, pick up Fight Club or Choke first, then move onto this.	2002-11-26

With a book like this, you're either going to love it or hate it.  If you're a Republican, or even the least little bit conservative, this book is going to grate on your nerves.  If you're a liberal, you're going to like it.<br />Personally, I'm a conservative.  I bought this book so I could get a liberal point-of-view.  After reading it I found that I still don't agree with anything in this book, but it was an interesting read.<br />Moore uses typical Democratic tactics.  Throughout the book he criticizes every member of the Bush administration, at times calling them flat-out crooks.  But never once does he EVER give a single reason to vote for a Democrat.  Rather, he gives reasons to vote against Republicans.  Republicans, as a group, have their flaws like any other group of people.  Even more so, seeing as how they're politicians.  But before I will ever support somebody else I need reasons to support them.<br />Now keep in mind, he isn't outright CAMPAIGNING in this book, but he may as well be.<br />Basically this book was written as propaganda against the Bush presidency and should be treated as nothing more.  Propaganda.	2002-11-20

Mirabelle is depressed and has been ever since her image of her father as a hero was shattered.  She is painfully shy and desperately wants someone to hold her.<br />Enter Jeremy, a sluggish product of the California Public Schools system who has not learned how to treat a lady.<br />Enter Ray Porter, a 50-something software millionaire who has not leanred to treat a lady either, but in a totally different way then Jeremy.<br />As you can probably guess, all sorts of shmoopy relationship squabbles ensue.  <br />When I bought this book, I was afraid of the shmoopy stuff.  About halfway through, however, I realized that I had laughed more than I had rolled my eyes.  By the end of the book I realized that I had thoroughly enjoyed the story and was hoping for more.<br />I think that Martin was able to keep me reading through the narrator's witty observations and comments.  It really put a male perspective on the entire relationship scene and made this book worth the time it took to read it.	2002-05-13

From his mother's enslavement of illegal immigrants to her numerous arson/insurance schemes: Kent doesn't cut his mom any slack.  It is still obvious, however, that his mother still has a small hold on him, even from prison, and probably always will.<br />This is an honest biography of a twisted sociopath who was able to control just about everybody who entered her life.

His stories are meaningful and fun to read.  Bradbury has a unique writing style when it comes to the dialogue of his characters.  His characters often use &quot;slang&quot; or shorcuts in their speech that often makes the dialogue hard to follow.  I first noticed this in Farenheit 451 and Something Wicked This Way Comes.<br />My chief complaint about this piece of work is that A)The stories are really, really short and don't alays make alot of sense and B)The dialogue is hard to follow because of the reason I mentioned before.<br />To make this short, don't buy this book unless you feel you need to read everything that Ray Bradbury has written.	2002-05-02

He is trying to make enough money to get his mother a feeding tube.  Needless to say, hilarious hijinks ensue.<br />This book is pretty funny, but doesn't have the deeper meaning that Fight Club had.  Its an entertaining read from a very talented author.

Colter was a fascinating woman and I would have liked to learn more about her than this book provided.<br />Being as how Colter isn't exactly someone you're likely to read more than one book about, I would recommend purchasing something with more pictures and information than this one, which is more just a basic outline.	2002-02-25

In an era where most of us start our adult lives with a car loan, mortgage and credit card debt this book is more meaningful then ever.<br />It tells the story of Willy Loman and his family. Willy has been selling furniture for a company for 35 years but is having trouble going on the road any longer because he's not getting any younger. Willy engages in a desperate struggle where he tries to provide for his family while keeping alive his dignity and in the end, realizes that he's worth more dead than alive (life insurance).<br />For most of us, this book speaks volumes about our lives. By the time we're finally ahead, its all over. Willy's interaction, or lack of it, with his son Biff is also interesting from a father-son aspect. Willy wants Biff to achieve at goals that Willy isn't going to be able to attain. Biff is too much like his father to ever attain those goals.  Willy and Biff get along famously while Biff is in high school but their relationship changes dramaticaly when Biff catches Willy in a disgraceful situation.<br />This book is a must-read for just about anyone. As a matter of fact, it should be required reading for every person in this nation.	2002-02-25

Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a funny book, but plan on reading the rest of the so called &quot;trilogy&quot; to get any real entertainment.  There's just not enough in one book to make it satisfying.<br />After reading Hitchhiker, I was left wanting more.  Not because its a bad book, quite the contrary.  Its just that it is so...short.  This is not a book that was first written to stand alone so you need to be sure to have all the sequels on hand when you start as it is a short read as well.<br />Overall, people who enjoy Monty-Python type hi-jinks will enjoy this.  People who do not like slapstick-type comedy, will not.	2002-02-21

As I am very familiar with his work this movie probably made more sense to me than to other people.  In essence, this movie isn't going to win any new fans for Thompson, but it will entertain his old ones.<br />In addition to that, the movie would have been just about worthless if it wasn't for Johnny Depp's *perfect* portrayl of Thompson.  I mean, he was perfect.  I have actually met Thompson (I got a ride with him back to the US from Mexico.  Long story...) and Depp had his voice, mannerisms, look, everything down perfectly.  Depp's performance coupled with a strong supporting performance by Del Torro makes this film what it is.<br />After the dissappointment I felt after the first Thompson-based movie, Where the Buffalo Roam (with Bill Murray as Thompson, he did a pretty good job, he just looks nothing like Thompson), I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  I was a little worried that they may botch Thompson's most famous work, but they didn't.  Its a good film well worth your time.	2002-02-06

It seemed, at times, that I would never learn anything new about the Masons.  There is good information in the book, its just very, very hard to find it.<br />Ridley may be better off sticking to broader topics where his digressions will be more appreciated.	2002-02-06

Thompson has made a career out of becoming a part of his journalistic endeavors.  He has dived into his stories so frequently and so deeply that he has developed his own character in them, the gonzo journalist.  The Rum Diary, thankfully, gives us a different look at Thompson: the quiet observer.  Quiet, that is, relative to the other characters in this book.<br />The Rum Diary chronicles Hunter's own time spent in Puerto Rico.  The book itself is a pretty wild ride.  After arriving in Puerto Rico, Thompson goes to work for a newspaper that is in the midst of a protest.  The reporters risk mugging just to enter the building.  Thompson soon meets a couple of friends and drunken hijinks ensue with Thompson and everybody else gorging themselves on the local drink, Rum (hence the title).  Think of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas but take away the drugs and add more booze.  That would be close.<br />This book isn't nearly as vital or symbolic as some of Thompson's more famous works but for true Thompson fans it offers an insight into the man, not the myth.	2002-01-29

In it, he examines the gospels and their supposed and suspected writers, archaeological sites in Jerusalm and Nazareth and a myriad of sources both pro-Christian and anti-Christian.<br />His views and findings are unique and he expresses them well.

Not ignoring Crowley's massive faults but rather explaining Crowley's reasons for his demeanor.<br />It is clear that Sutin spent a lot of time researching this book and his effort shows.  This is a must-read book for anybody interested in the development of cults in America or even the oft-overlooked fascination that Victorian culture had for the occult.	2002-01-23

While I'm not that familiar with Mr. Straub's work it seems to me that this book belongs to Mr. King.<br />This story catches our hero from the Talisman, Jack Sawyer, living in French Landing, Wisconsin, during a crime wave caused by a serial killer called The Fisherman.  Mr. Fisherman's crimes bear a pronounced similarity with those of Albert Fish, hence the nickname.<br />As you can probably guess, Sawyer manages to save the day while once again having bizarre and somewhat disturbing adventures into The Territories, or Faraway, as another character calls it.<br />This book ties in closely with King's Dark Tower Series and it is in fact another important chapter in that series.  If you're not familiar with The Dark Tower Series you may get a little bit lost towards the end of this book.<br />I gave this book a lower rating because its kind of slow paced.  It never really picks up until right at the end when Sawyer and company saves the day.  It was entertaining, however, because of the Dark Tower references which makes me wonder even more, what was Straub's involvement with this?  Did he check the spelling or name the characters?  Who knows, but I would imagine that it would be easy to get lost in the shadow cast by Stephen King.<br />If you were to read this book for no other reason than the fact that it was written by Stephen King, you wouldn't be disappointed.  While not his best book, it has substantial entertainment value.  Really, what else can you expect from a book?	2001-12-28

This story is one of the classics that everybody should read.  Apart from that, its the greatest story ever written in the fantasy genre.  If Tolkien wasn't the one who invented this genre then he is quite easily the most influential writer in it.  Period.<br />The story is a continuation from the Hobbit.  Bilbo is still involved but the main character now is Frodo Baggins, Bilbo's relative.  Frodo is joined by several friends (including Gandalf) and sets off on a journey that is just slightly more important than Bilbo's saving the Dwarves ancestrol home: Frodo must save the world.<br />Being a long story you may find yourself constantly looking back in the book to remember place names and characters.  Its worth it, however, as you can tell that Tolkien inserted each tiny detail with a maximum amount of care and precision.<br />It has been said that Tolkien's intent was to create a &quot;mythological&quot; history for England.  I would say that he succeeded.	2001-12-20

I'm very glad they did.  It is a memoir of Hemingway's time in Paris during the 1920's.  During that time he and his first wife, Hadley, lived on $5.00 a day.<br />I first heard of this book in the movie, City of Angels (Nicholas Cage, Meg Ryan).  In it, Cage reads a quote from it to Ryan.  The quote interested me and I bought the book.  I was amazed.<br />The characters in this book are extroridnary including everyone from Ezra Pound to Aleister Crowley.  He narrates stories including F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda that are so acidic they almost hurt to read.<br />Hemingway was at his best when he wrote this book.  It is a memoir of an aging man looking back on a very happy time in his life.  Its a great place to start for Hemingway beginners and a touching read for Hemingway veterans.	2001-12-19

Let me start by saying that if you have never read anything by Dr. Thompson before, do not start with this book.  Rather, start with some of his earlier material (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or one of his many articles for Rolling Stone).<br />I don't recommend this book to first-time Thompson readers because it is so disjointed that the reader, without knowing Thompson's style, may give up on Thompson before discovering his other great writings.<br />This is not one of Doc's greatest books, but its entertaining, none the less.  Its almost worth it just for the funny pictures/faxes and the vicious jabs thrown at all of the canidates.<br />I rated this book with four stars because I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  I enjoyed it so much because I am a Thompson fan and eat up almost everything he writes.  Other people, however, would be better off starting with something written a little bit earlier in Thompson's career.	2001-11-16

I read it in about 12 hours and it did exactly what I wanted it to do, it passed the time.  Isn't that part of what all books are supposed to do?  If the author keeps you entertained while you're reading the book, his/her job is done.<br />The story line was very good, above-average in my opinion.  I had never read Follete before as best-selling books aren't what I usually purchase.<br />There were no slow moments in this book.  I didn't analyze it for historical accuracy but taken purely as a work of fiction written for entertainment, it was very fulfilling.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone looking for something fun and exciting to read.	2001-11-16

As with Mr. Ellis' American Psycho I am once again forced to stretch my mind for a meaning for this book.<br />The main character, Clay, is the expected disenchanted, disconnected youth.  From there the book spirals down into the darkness and depravity which can only be contained in L.A.  Almost every character in this book (even some children) uses mountains of drugs.<br />I'm sure this is all presented as an example of &quot;Teenage Angst,&quot; but I couldn't relate to it.  This may be because I'm from the Midwest and haven't been exposed to the situations this book deals with.  Others may relate to it far better than I.<br />The book is written very well and the storyline is intriguing.  It was fun to read and I enjoyed it, but its no Catcher in the Rye.	2001-11-16
US	44493365	R1GRC02RQE9XHD	1566630568	733206591	Shakespeare	Books	4	9	11	N	N	A very competent biography	Mr. Burgess knows his Shakespeare and shares his wealth of knowledge in a very fascinating way.  Almost every aspect of the Bard's life is analyzed and it creates a very entertaining story.<br />Not much is known about William Shakespeare himself.  This often forces Burgess to make educated conjectures as to what the truth may have been.  When Burgess puts forth his opinion he supports it with so much fact that you almost feel that if it wasn't the way Burgess said it was, it should have been.<br />All-in-all, if you are a Shakespeare man and want to know what inspired and influenced him, this book is for you.  Burgess knows Shakespeare like no other person.	2001-11-12

It is a very easy to read book and flows quickly from begining to end (I read it in about 2 1/2 hours).  The point of view is very realistic.  So real, as a matter of fact, that you can almost smell the booze on the main characters breath after a night of binge-drinking.<br />I don't know that this book offers any profound insights into life, however.  I think that it is better appreciated for what it appears to be on the surface: a laconic editorial written by a cynical, though happy, man.	2001-11-12

I'm not sure what Mr. Ellis was attempting to accomplish with all the sex and violence, but I can tell you what I think he was trying to accomplish...<br />The 1980's, in my mind, was the &quot;bored&quot; generation.  We had everything (not that we don't now) from our favorite music on TV and video games right in our homes.  I remember being a kid and always telling my parents &quot;I'm bored, there's nothing to do.&quot;  Ellis' book reminds me of that.<br />As you read the shocking descriptions of sick sex and violence you become bored.  Person after person is slaughtered and you soon find yourself wondering when a hero is going to poke his head out of the rubble.  If you think about the '80's, a decade when movies were made or broke at the box office by the amount of violence in them (video games too, for that matter) the violence in this book begins to make sense.  I think Ellis speaking to how there is nothing sensational any more.  Nothing is &quot;over the top.&quot;<br />There are a few funny moments when you depart the depravity for some quite in-depth reviews of the works of Phil Collins, Whitney Houston and other pop-artists.  For the most part, however, this book makes just one long, blood drenched, gore-choked, meandering point: &quot;The 1980's was a decade for the disenchanted.&quot;	2001-11-12

Mr. Gilmour was an investigator with the Alaska State Troopers for many years and was, and still is, one of the most astute criminal investigators you will ever meet.  This book details the incredible amount of work it takes to catch a serial killer.  The most amazing part is that he has not made any changes to the story to make it &quot;more exciting&quot; or &quot;more readable.&quot;  The story certainly does need it.  In my opinion, in this book rivals Capote's In Cold Blood, but without making up any facts.	2001-04-04
