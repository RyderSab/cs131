As with any series, I don't recommend you pick up the books in the middle-- so I'm obviously going to write this review to people who are already familiar with and have read the first two books. <br /> <br />Plot-wise, this is probably the more interesting of the three books. I mean, it doesn't get any better than descending into the seven circles of Hell and navigating your way through while avoiding the bad guys trying to trip you up. You've got a \\"witch\\" who needs a body. And a sudden confusion of who is really good and who is really bad-- and why! <br /> <br />Yet, it seemed like a sloppier writing job, overall. It took me a long time to actually get into the book. The other two, from the first couple of pages, were hard to put down. Yet, until I reached the 1/4th point I had to admit that I just didn't care. After that, things went smoother and was a brisk, nice read. <br /> <br />My biggest complaint, though, is the use of foreshadowing. Particularly in regards to the tempting fruit tree in the begining of the story. It appears as a large temptation for Bonnie-- and later in the story it is referenced again-- yet, nothing ever comes of it. There is no moment of peril where she might pluck the fruit. I was *dreading* that point in the story, yet when it all was said and done, my anticipation was for nothing. <br /> <br />*spoiler in next paragraph! be warned!* <br /> <br />From a storyline perspective, the greatest flaw of the story is the healing of Bonnie. It was pretty well conveyed in the story that Bonnie was dead. We hope and hope for a miracle to happen. However, when it does, there is no real explaination of HOW it happened. Its one of those deals where Billy blanks out, then when he comes to Bonny is staring at him, alive and well. It's a fantasy. I don't mind if the explaination is far fetched. However, *i do want an explaination!* I would have prefered her to stay dead instead of this \\"oh, hi!\\" resurection. It doesn't help that the tension throught the last quarter of the book is whether she survives or not. It was sloppy writing. <br /> <br />*spoiler free from here on out!* <br /> <br />Bryan Davis, despite these stumbles, is a good writer. However, for future books he would be advised to take more care in paying attention to the tensions he sets up in the book and not just letting them die (the tree) or being too lazy to think about a good solution and just using a half-hearted one (Bonnie).  <br /> <br />Quite honestly, if this was his first book and the first in a series, it would be more of a 3 star books. But based on his past efforts, I could still read it and enjoy it and think it was pretty good. Hence the four stars.	2005-06-28
US	19783408	R1H8OUPLWYPLLU	1568582862	632298133	A Place So Foreign and Eight More	Books	4	3	4	N	N	...	Short story collections tend to frustrate me, as it seems the story hardly gets into the swing of things before a conclusion is hastily tapped on. The best short story collection I have read is \\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\" by Kurt Vonnegut, which is one of the most dazzling displays of \\"modern\\" writing I've stumbled upon. \\"A Place SO Foreign and 8 More\\" does not quite reach Vonnegut level, but is still a very enjoyable collection of stories. <br /> <br />Most of the time I really enjoyed Doctorow's prose. There were a few times he fell into the trap of trying to use too many \\"smart\\" phrases in one place, however, overall the writing is sharp and interesting. <br /> <br />The one thing I really like about Doctorow's writing is how he doesn't have to explain things... he SHOWS them. For example, in the story \\"Return to Pleasure Island,\\" the main character is not human, but Doctorow avoids blantantly saying so. Instead he throws in \\"clues.\\" Since the story is from the creature's perspective, regular humans are \\"soft ones.\\" When he takes off his coat, he notices a lot of brown dirt-- a sign he is getting along in age. It's all very nonchalant which allows it to work.  <br /> <br />The best story in the collection is \\"Home Again, Home Again,\\" which is a look at life in a future \\"bat-house\\"... a home for mentally unstable people. While Docotorow tinkers with the idea that switching between first person and third person in reference to the same guy is powerful, it's really just confusing and it would have been better in first person only. I understand the concept he was going for, but it just wasn't working. That small bit aside, the story it's self was a stunning peep into different relationships which AREN'T real, but through Doctorow's writing sure do feel like they are. <br /> <br />Indeed, a reoccurring theme in Docotorow's stories is relationships between people-- usually friends and family. Unlike many edgy sci-fi writers who seem to sacrifice the relationships fortechnology, Docotorow's focus on them keeps the stories grounded and human. Yet his obvious technology obsession gives them the fantasy and future that marks science fiction. <br /> <br />It is exciting to stumble upon such a talent this early in his carreer. Expect bigger and better things from him in the future.	2005-06-27

Perhaps he would have decided that an autobiography on his life would be a good idea. Because while, without one, we can get by on books like \\"Wish You Were Here\\" by Nick Webb, nothing quite replaces Adams' own voice. <br /> <br />Webb writes the biography as well as can be under the circumstances. He has obviously gone to a lot of work interviewing and getting information from the people Adams worked with, was friends with, and knew growing up. <br /> <br />Read \\"Last Chance To See\\" first, for a first hand account of some of Adams' adventures (plus, it may just be his best book!)... then pick this up to read.

In fact, it's the only comic strip I ever buy, period. The characters of the strip have become a kind of family for me. <br /> <br />Get Fuzzy books are always worth the money... this one is no exception. However, as it ranks with the other Get Fuzzy books, this one isn't quite as amazing. The laughs at the begining were close to non-existant, though once the book got in the swing of things it was great stuff. I laughed outrageously hard at a few of the strips (esp. Satchel's ode to cheese! amazing.) <br /> <br />This book should be purchased. If you don't own any Get Fuzzy books, though, start somewhere else. THEN pick this one up.	2005-05-21
US	19783408	R23R0JYMPMSAJ6	084991180X	723070327	Monster	Books	3	6	8	N	N	...	\\"Monster\\" finds Peretti writing a Crichton-esque \\"thriller,\\" where science has gone askew. As much as it aspires to be a Jurassic Park, Peretti fails to inspire both the fearful peril of the Crichton classic, or the variety of the read. <br /> <br />Peretti sets the majority of Monster in a large, mainly wild forest. Our only break from that is the rare paragraphs where a side character does some university scouting. Making a forest interesting for the length of an entire book is really only managable if you are an expert wordsmith, which Peretti is not. <br /> <br />As much as the publishers want the reader to think there will be many twists, there aren't. Most essential points are laid out easily in the first quarter of the book. Pay basic attention to the desciptions provided and you realize that things don't quite add up. The solution is easy to decipher from there. <br /> <br />The publisher wants to believe so hard that the book is scary that they warn us in the introduction. I can't imagine any adult finding this book even remotely threatening. I'm the sort who can't watch lame horror movies without about losing it, but this book sure didn't faze me. <br /> <br />That's two ways the publisher has underestimated the reader... our ability to figure out a plot, and our scare level... they hurl one final insult at us. They don't trust us to be able to keep track of where everyone is (despite only a few main characters to keep track of), so they provide maps at the end of each chapter as a kind of \\"re-cap\\". They are pathetic little maps like you might use in 5th grade to solve math problems. The book isn't that complicated to need this little visual tidbit. <br /> <br />The (few) scientific ideas present are interesting... however, mostly attempt to use raw logic instead of actual science. They'll be things I ponder, perhaps, but I'm not going to use them in any kind of significant arguement. I mean, paying attention to science in a book like this is like reading\\"The DaVinci Code\\" and taking it's religion at face value. <br /> <br />This was honestly a two star book... but I gave it three because I liked the whole bigfoot theme. Borrow the book from the library... but spending money on it will probably yield disappointment.	2005-04-15

The thing that impresses me most about this book is the sense of humor used throughout. Its not just stats, figures, and predictions. The writers actually let their personality shine through. I really bow to the editor of this for not squelching the creativity. I found myself laughing harder at something things said in this than at most Simpsons episodes.

Don't ask me how I managed to not fail Biology. It wasn't until I bought \\"The Elegant Universe\\" by Brian Greene that I realized that perhaps I could wrap my head around this science stuff after all. Since then I've been on a hunt for any science book that strikes my fancy (yet looks like it would make sense to the lay reader such as myself). <br /> <br />\\"Mutants\\" by Leroi caught my eye due to the freak show element of the topic. The cover is a good catch: a man with a regular head and torso, but no arms or legs... but hands and feet attached to the torso. I read the first chapter or so in the bookstore and decided that Leroi's writing was interesting and clear enough that someone like myself would be able to read it without getting bogged down in long, technical descriptions. <br /> <br />As perhaps expected, there were parts I didn't quite understand... but that's ok. Leroi's writing is good enough to still keep the book moving. After all, I didn't remember anything from my biology class, so without even a brief crash course in genetics I did a lot of learning on the fly.  <br /> <br />The most interesting parts were when Leroi digged into the lives of people who lived with a mutation (or a less severe part of genetic variety). These stories gave the conditions a face (or faces) and feelings. <br /> <br />One of the things that influenced me to buy the book was that I noticed in the index that Leroi touched upon progeria, a condition where people physically age at an acellerated rate. I've been facinated with progeria and the people with it ever since I read \\"Otherworld: City of Gold\\" by Tad Williams where one of the main characters suffers from it. Unfortunately, once I got to that part in the book there was nothing more than a paragraph mention without any attempt to dig into it further. So that was disappointing and sad. It should have justified at least a couple of pages. <br /> <br />My big complaint with the book is how the end notes were handled. Most books place something in the text to alert you that there is an end note, usually a number, however \\"Mutants\\" gave no mention of the end notes in the text so it wasn't until I got to the end that I realized there WERE end notes. Future editions would be well advised to place markers in the book its self for the reader's ease. <br /> <br />But all in all it was a good introduction to genetics for someone who has no background in the subject.	2005-03-05
US	19783408	R1V7EAXQJAOORA	0689856393	933167536	Kira-Kira (Newbery Medal Book)	Books	4	6	9	N	N	...	\\"Kira-Kira\\" is a story about a Japanese-American girl, Katie, and her relationship with Lynnie, her sister. While the read was good, and and it's a book I recommend, I felt like the book wasn't quite good enough to be the Newbery Medal winner. <br /> <br />I'm going to focus on the flaws here because other readers have done a good job of the positive points. So even though this sounds like an overly negative review, I agree with my four star rating. <br /> <br />The storyline and ending is set up pretty early in the novel. You know that Katie and her sister are close, and that something happens to her sister. The rest of the novel then sets up their relationship and the various events that change it. To me, the book would have been stronger if the author had not foreshadowed the eventual emotional climax of the book on the first page.  <br /> <br />There is another odd part where the author foreshadows certain things at the end of chapter one, \\"We got sent to bed without supper because my parents said hitting someone was the worst thing you could do. Stealing was second, and lying was third. Before I was twelve, I would have committed all three of those crimes.\\" You get the feeling that those three items will be the thrust of the storyline of the novel. And while all three do HAPPEN, they feel merely like sidenotes... events that happen but don't really mean anything. For the stealings... sure, she gets in trouble... but it doesn't seem like her perspective changed because of it. She didn't even ever get found out about punching someone or lying... no lesson learned, no change of character. If it wasn't for the foreshadow, it wouldn't matter. But because of the foreshadowing (which also happens to be the quote on the back cover) it seemed to me that the author casually made that promise to the reader, then half way through the novel realized that she needed to follow up on that and threw them in half heartedly. <br /> <br />In fact, almost every single case of foreshadowing ends up in disappointment. Katie is told that school will be tough because she is Japanese in a time where that sort of thing is mistrusted. And while it is later off-handedly mentioned that most people didn't talk to her, we don't really see the effects of this on her. It's like it doesn't matter... when in reality something like that would be devistating to a child. <br /> <br />Foreshadowing problems aside, Kadohata's writing just feels a bit flat to me. She failed to completely wrap me up in the novel. There was a couple of interesting quirks that made me smile, but they were rare. What really saved the book, really, was the way the author textures Katie and Lynnie's relationship. Relationships and characters drive books for me more than plots. <br /> <br />Definately a book I recommend you read... but definately not award-worthy, either.	2005-02-04
US	19783408	R3CQB11XBHOQTL	0380789035	337033298	American Gods	Books	4	3	3	N	N	...	I bought this on a whim after seeing it for sale at a used bookstore. The only thing I'd read by him prior this was the amazingly funny \\"Good Omens,\\" which he co-wrote with the great Terry Pratchett. While a bit darker in tone, and not the avalance of jokes that \\"Good Omens\\" was, I was happy to find that \\"American Gods\\" was still farily humorous.<br /><br />The main character, Shadow, is set in the present day and has the same level of understanding at how the world work as we do. He lives (albiet in prison), has joys and tribuation and looks forward to getting out. Unfortunaty, the way he gets out of prison is less than ideal. With his whole world smashing around him, Mr. Wednesday offers a helping hand in the form of a job.<br /><br />Early on, Mr. Wednesday displays some... unusal qualities. It doesn't take too terribly long to figure out what he is (a god created in the minds of people long ago) and what he's trying to accomplish (surviving against modern gods)... and in doing so needs to unite all the different \\"old\\" gods.<br /><br />Shadow ends up his assistant, and as a result his perception of the world has to change. (I mean, how many people will have the television god talk to you in the form of Lucy from I love Lucy?)With his new position he sparks a lot of interest in the god sub-culture... and a lot of danger.<br /><br />Overall the book is written well. Toward the end things get a bit confusing and muddied, however, by the time the book rolls to it's conclusion, everything feels in order. The characters are mostly written well, with one exception.<br /><br />Shaddow runs into a girl named Sam. She is one of those interesting girls whom can make or break a story. Unfortunately, after her first appearance, she drifts into the background and only makes a few more appearances. She should have become a semi-main character, instead it feels like she was discarded.<br /><br />The writing does tend to feel a bit pop culture, it won't be a stunning epic. But it is a fun and enjoyable read. And unlike one reviewer tried to imply, the book isn't all violece and sex. While there are two or three graphic sex scenes, they aren't long and easy to skip over. The violence actually seems minimal for a book like this and isn't overly gruesome or reveled in.epic.

US	19783408	R3P674A7CD8988	0886777631	634336906	City of Golden Shadow (Otherland, Volume 1)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	...	As of this writing I just finished \\"City of GOlden Shadow\\" and have not moved on to the other books in the series (although I have volume to sitting next to me waiting for a chance!)... <br /> <br />In one of my writing classes in highschool we would write things, then have in class critiques. To start off the critique we would have to come up with good, positive things to say about the piece in question. Only after positives were mentioned could we move on to the negative aspects and the things about the writing that should be worked on.  <br /> <br />For \\"City of Golden Shadow\\" there are numberous positive aspects. The writing does a good job of offering the reader a mental picture of the enviroments the characters are in. Which is great because there are a great variety of different settings, both real and simulated. <br /> <br />The characters are believable and feel genuine. Williams paints each one so that their actions reflect them without feeling like they are doing anything a real person like them wouldn't. There is an aspect of \\"Ender's Game\\" by Orson Scott Card, insofar as we have kids put in adult situations in simulations (though in a different context, so the relational dynamics are decidedly different). <br /> <br />There are negatives. The one that stands out above the others is how long the book is compared to how far the plot advances. It seems the only thing keeping the book moving is the interesting characters and the novelty of the delemas. This is definately not a book for the plot-driven reader. People who enjoy books that focus more on the characters (ala Martha Grimes) will not care about this factor as much. <br /> <br />My biggest complaint with the book is that Williams chose the wrong character to be the driving force behind the plot. Orlando (Thargor) is the most sympathetic and interesting character and would have made a much more facinating study than Renie and her friend, !Xabbu. While Renie's struggles with her brother in a coma andher father who's given up on life have their emotional pull, it's also very cliche and we've read hundreds of books with the exact same delema (though, a decidedly different ways of solving it!). Orlando, on the other hand, has crafted his own identity online where he can be the strong hero he wants to be... instead of the sick kid isolated in a rich neighborhood. Williams paints Orlando's character much better than he does Renie, despite making her the lead. <br /> <br />One suggestion for possible future printings would be to place under each chapter heading the character that chapter focuses on. Too often the chapter starts out and it takes a page or two until you can latch onto which character is being focused on. It was especially difficult with the Dread sections. <br /> <br />Overall, though, the negatives I outlined are outweighted by the strength of Williams' writing and vision. It'll be interesting to see if the following books in the series can keep things interesting and if they start being more plot driven since all of the characters have been introduced and defined already.	2005-01-14
US	19783408	R9O6V82CVP2L8	0060512806	555229230	Cryptonomicon	Books	4	2	2	N	N	...	Cryptonomicon had a big chance of failing. It's a large book, over 1000 pages, which continually bounces between WWII and \\"present day\\" while juggling between several main characters. Not to mention the frequent several page rants Stephenson would engage in that simply inform the reader about... well, stuff. It's a recipe for disaster, and according to many of the reviewers it did. <br /> <br />What saved the book for me was how well Stephenson keeps things moving. Each chapter is focused on one of the main characters (Waterhouse of WWII, Randy Waterhouse of present, Shaftoe WWII, and Goto Dengo of WWII) so you are constantly switching between eras and plots. Just when you think you're going to scream if you have to read about another sunken U boat, you get a chapter on cryptic annalysis. This allowed me to plow through good portions of the book in a single sitting. <br /> <br />Perhaps the feature that would deter most readers is the Stephenson's fondness for large, technical descriptions of... everything. And while some authors might BS a lot, judging from the reviews here, most of the stuff Stephenson informs us on is on target. These descriptions facinated me... however, I could see how a lot of audiences would find them to be a bore. <br /> <br />The characters are well written, although the plot is questionable. The ending suggested by the beginning of the book is hardly the one that ends up transpiring. It felt like the book could have gone on for another 500 pages.	2005-01-08
US	19783408	R1JB52XDI8ZFRO	0843951362	95042991	The Adventures of Charley Tooth	Books	3	4	4	N	N	...	Despite an awkward beginning and an awkward ending, \\"The Adventures of Charley Tooth\\" manages to create a fun plot with engaging characters. The read was fun and at the sale cost was worth the price of admission. <br /> <br />The three star rating is a combination of several features. One star was subtracted for the above-mentioned beginning and end, and the other taken away for some general writing development problems. <br /> <br />For the first half or so of the book the story developes at a certain pace which works well. Then all of a sudden it starts to steamroll through certain features which the reader really needs to know about the characters. For instance, the major thrust of the book is that Charley comes from a non-magical world and is suddenly in a world where magic is relatively commonplace (kind of like how plumbers are common to us... not everyone is a plumberer, but we all know one or two.) He obviously has some natural talent and is taught by a knowledgable magician so that he can overthrow the government. The whole key to the story is that Charley has to be adept enough to be able to overthrow the two great sorcerers of the land... yet Richards only touches on Charley's education briefly... almost as a sidenote. <br /> <br />My favorite books are more character driven than plot driven, and it's with his characters that Richards manages to make Charley Tooth an interesting read. While I loathe the literary term \\"flashback\\" I like the concept when it is in place to strengthen character (plot flashbacks are completely advoidable and SHOULD be advoided when possible... and are mostly advoided here)... like when Charley is riding in a carriage after their revolution collapsed and he should be thinking about his lover, instead thinks about his family and the last times he had with them. Not only are the scenes touching, but really paint his character as having grown beyond his years. <br /> <br />The ending is... bad. And the only excuse for doing that is if Richards intends to make Charley Tooth into a series and continue it beyond this one book.  <br /> <br />All in all, however, I think it's a worthwhile read if the book can be gotten at the library. Just don't expect literary genious.	2004-12-22

I was really excited after reading \\"Raising Dragons.\\" It had been a long time since a decent children's fantasy had released by a Christian author... (though around the same time \\"Dragonspell\\" by Donita K Paul was released, and it is also fantastic.) Bryan Davis' writing felt fresh and the ideas he presented were new and unlike anything I had read before. <br /> <br />\\"Candlestone\\" is a good continuation of the story. While it doesn't feel quite as fresh (because we've already gotten over the shock of something great in \\"Raising Dragons\\") Fans of the first one will definately enjoy the second one, while those who didn't like the first won't change their mind after reading this. <br /> <br />I like how it goes into Bonnie's story farther, making her a more central point of the series. In the first one she had a nice roll, but Billy took front and center the majority of the time. Here other characters flesh out better and father define their role in the series. <br /> <br />I really like how the books like the present with the past with a fantasy twist with folklore and legend mingling with it also. The aware parent may wish to clarify with their children that the King Arthur story present in these books are obviously fantasy and hold little baring with the real King Arthur.	2004-12-17
US	19783408	R1IPRHMW9SZ2CB	0441011934	987517519	Heroics for Beginners	Books	4	0	0	N	N	...	I really enjoyed \\"Heroics for Beginners.\\" It's a fantasy novel that pokes fun at the genre by pointing out certain flaws and traits while making the reader feel like Moore loves the genre and enjoys contributing to it. <br /> <br />It seems to pull from a variety of inspirations... it makes fun of Harry Potter with it's villian, Lord Voltmere (He Who Must Be Named), and draws (perhaps?) from The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy by naming the book after a book in the book. Yet while each of those has their momentary laugh, the book refrains from being a specific parody all the way through. Unlike some books which get the laugh, then continue to mention it and mention it until the reader is sick and tired of the author's concieted cleverness. <br /> <br />There are probably even references that I don't pick up on since I haven't read all the fantasy books out there, but that's ok. It's the general references to standard fantasy ploys that get the biggest responces. Everything from how people enter castles unnoticed to how villains act. <br /> <br />Books like this tend to fall flat because they lack something... the author is so busy parodying and trying to convince us that he is cleverer than anyone else that he neglects to develop characters or lay out a plot. Moore, however, had characters that I cared for and enjoyed reading about. The plot was relatively standard, but propelled well and thoughtfully. I definately recommend the book.	2004-12-02

The problem with this kind of book is that it's joke is limited. After the novelty wears off, it all becomes a bit stale.. but then, don't most REAL self-help books?! <br /> <br />Some of the sections are quite funny... for instance, the part on how to start smoking (you start of by building up your nicotine addiction by wearing the patch or chewing nicotine gum!)... also quite funny was the self mutilation section (everything from enlargement of \\"certain reproductive features\\" to cutting). <br /> <br />The greatest flaw of the book, perhaps, is how it never quite goes as far or gets as outrageous as it should.

I'm not quite sure why you would write under a pen name when they go ahead and proclaim in bold letters, \\"Agatha Christie writing as Mary Westmacott!\\" It seems a bit counter-productive to me. But no matter. <br /> <br />This is the first Westmacott/Christie book that I've read (though I've done a very good job of reading through a good percentage of the Christie canon) and it was more than I was expecting. There is no real mystery bend to \\"The Burden\\" that matters (though, one thing is revealed at the end... nothing major)... it's all about relationships between people. <br /> <br />The book is divided into three main parts, each part from a different person's perspective. And while the parts are chronological, years seperate them... thus taking a chapter within the part to get a grip on where in the story we actually are. <br /> <br />Interestingly, the begining does NOT dictate the ending. At least, not how we exect it to. The begining conflict is how Laura wants her baby sister to die. That is resolved by the end of part one. Part two centers around Laura's sister, Shirley and how she finds love and marries and the complications that brings. The end of part two resolves that (in an implied way... but latter reveal to be correct). Then part three centers around a guy (who's name i forget... sorry!) and is an exploration of his life and his facination with a girl who lives on an island (who turns out to be Shirley). That part then ends bringing happiness to him... while STILL resolving a seed that Christi... erm, Westmacott planted in part one. <br /> <br />I would definately recommend The Burden as a good novella... though Christie fans mainly interested in fantastic twist endings will find it to be boring and uninteresting.	2004-11-02
US	19783408	RBJKXKTZWQS7Z	0060082194	757728138	Rum Punch	Books	4	1	1	N	N	...	Like many others, I read this book after watching \\"Jackie Brown.\\" I hadn't read a Leonard book before, so was unsure quite what the writing would be like. I was pleased to find that it didn't try too hard to be deep and descriptive. The story moved and was a quick read. <br /> <br />The interesting things about \\"Rum Punch\\" is also what makes \\"Jackie Brown\\" a really good film. Leonard has other side plots and stories happening that don't appear at all in the film, so there are still some surprises for those who watched the movie. Yet, for the movie story, it was definately good to cut those out as it really tightened up the flow of the story. <br /> <br />The best thing about the book was the ending. In \\"Jackie Brown,\\" Tarantino takes the ending beyond \\"Rum Punch's\\" by a hair... making a conclution for the viewer that Leonard had let the readers make for themselves. I prefer the way Leonard doesn't make any definate conclution about whether Max goes with Jackie or if he stays with his bail bonds business.	2004-10-27

While it had it's negative points, it caused me to think about certain aspects of writing that I hadn't to that point. It helped me to understand why I liked what I liked about the last story I wrote, and why there were parts I didn't like. <br /> <br />Writing takes work and this book won't make it easier (no book will, I suspect), however, it'll get you to think about how to make your characters and story stronger. <br /> <br />If you've already taken english classes on the topic or attended seminars or read other books, there is a good chance you don't need this book. However, it does come from a nice lay viewpoint which I found helpful.	2004-10-23
US	19783408	R21B9ADK7XYELC	0590442104	302552220	I Want to Go Home!	Books	5	1	1	N	N	...	This was one of my favorite books growing up. I read it until the cover and copyright pages fell off, and by using regular scotch tape I was able to keep the text of the book together. <br /> <br />Now, at the age of 20, went back to read it and surprisingly the book was still as funny as the first time. So I had to order a new copy to replace my tattered one. I had to pay $11 used, but it was worth it. If you see this book cheap anywhere DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and PICK IT UP. <br /> <br />It's amazing how over the years I've quoted this book without realizing it. As I was re-reading it I caught myself saying, Hey! I've said simular things in simular situations. <br /> <br />Probably the reason this book resonates so deeply is because all the characters all feel genuine. You've got Rudy Miller who doesn't want to go to camp and tries to escape (and excells at everything he does when forced to do it)... Mike Webster who becomes Rudy's one friend in camp and hates it as much as Rudy (without the side complication of being good at anything)... Chip, their camp \\"clone\\" councilor, who ends up as the brunt of Rudy's dry humor... Pierre, the arts and crafts councilor, who comes as close as anyone to understanding Miller. <br /> <br />It's a shame this book is out of print. Most kids would identify with this book and enjoy it. I highly reccomend it.	2004-10-22

Christie has, in the past, used occultic themes in some short stories, or as a side element in a full length. This time, however, she chose to flesh that out and use it at the heart of one of her mysteries. <br /> <br />\\"The Pale Horse\\" is a good read for several reasons. She uses several characters that have appeared in other novels, but none of them are named Poirot or Marple. This forces her to flesh out other characters since she can't rely on either of them to carry the story. While one doesn't read Christie to get intimate with characters (as opposed to Martha Grimes), it's nice to get a better look at some characters. <br /> <br />The story revolves around a society where people mysteriously kill people without leaving a trace. It is \\"advertised\\" as killing through supernatural powers controled by three witches. As a result it seems impossible to prove... and even more possible to convict without getting laughed out of court. <br /> <br />The solution is good (and I only guessed the mastermind through a semi-lucky guess), however, the best part is the explaination mid-way through the book about how the payment for the murder happens. That was bloody ingenious. The solicitor and the person wanting to hire the murder make a bet. If the person to be killed dies before a certain date, the person wanting the murder pays X amount of money. If the person to be killed doesn't, then the solicitor pays up the money. <br /> <br />It's all in all a satisfying read and will probably keep you guessing throughout the book.	2004-10-18

This book was a surprise. <br /> <br />The bookstore I work at gave this to me to read and review and I was innitially skeptical... there have only been a handful of Christian authors to successfully pull off fantasy (Lewis, Tolkien, L'Engle) and I doubted if any new Christian fantasy would do anything other than try to Christianize Harry Potter (GP Taylor). <br /> <br />I turned out to be wrong (and went on to read \\"Raising Dragons\\" by Bryon Davis which is also quality)... and I'm glad I gave the book a chance. <br /> <br />Donita K. Paul doesn't try to force a story but let's the story weave it's self. She creates great characters who are believable. When the characters aren't perfect you understand because you have been in simular situations where misunderstandings happen. <br /> <br />Most encouraging was how the story could be read and enjoyed without feeling like the book was preaching at you. Paul uses some allegory, but it is subtle and tasteful... not quite as subtle as Tolkien (who hated allegory and just wrote stories...) but not as obvious as Lewis (who intentinally wrote allegorically). People who don't share the Christian faith should be able to read this story, like Lord of the Rings, without feeling like Paul is trying to trick them into any kind of religious belief.	2004-10-15

Paul (author of \\"Dragonspell\\") reccomended it on her website.  <br /> <br />The story is set in the current, modern age with a school boy going through a physical crisis (which we all experienced in school and can sympathise with.) Only instead of have a large zit on his nose, or walking with a limp, or wearing glasses, he is experiencing hot breath. <br /> <br />The reader soon learns that he has dragon blood, and this is a part of the natural process of his species. Unfortunately, with all the perks of being a dragon, it has it's downsides. While most of the world has no idea there is still a small dragon population in hiding, there is still a dragon slayer who hates them and wants to eliminate the world of their clutches. <br /> <br />The story is quick paced and, despite how silly the plot sounds at first (a boy who becomes a dragon? what?!), Davis explains the concept well (and as far as I know, it is an original one). \\"Raising Dragons\\" has the added dimention/complication of being set in the current day, so it doesn't really feel like a fantasy, per se. <br /> <br />Definately a unique and interesting book and I can't wait for the second book in the series, \\"Candlestone,\\" to release.	2004-10-15

So, you've read the books... bought the tv series on dvd, gone through all the special features (including the comment captions on the film)... read the biographies... and hunted up collectors items on ebay. What next? <br /> <br />Get this book. \\"The Original Hitchhiker Radio Scripts\\" contains many scenes not in the books and, if you've already heard the radio series, many lines that were trashed for time. There is also commentary after each episode by Perkins and Adams. <br /> <br />Some things will seem eerily familiar, then zoom off into a completely different direction and, in my opinion, a better direction. Of course, some things are missing that make the books equally essential. <br /> <br />You can currently get this at a pretty good price used from amazon. Get it now before you can't get it at all.	2004-10-12

It was ok for young adults, but the characters were uninteresting and the writing tedious. <br /> <br />Much to my surprise \\"Wormwood\\" is an improvement. Taylor chucked his \\"Shadowmancer\\" characters and setting and made new characters and a new setting. The biggest improvement was in the overall tone of the book. The book feels overall darker, making more appropriate for the teen age group, as opposed to the pre-teens.  <br /> <br />Again, as with \\"Shadowmancer,\\" not too many characters were ones which you sympathize with much... but unlike the prior book, their situations are interesting enough to keep me curious as to what would happen next.  <br /> <br />The writing feels smoother and more worked out. It's obvious that Taylor isn't writing books that will become classics, but in the present \\"Wormwood\\" is an entertaining weekend or beach read.	2004-10-12

Lately I've been keeping a tab on the Christian fantasy/sci-fi that's been released in the past half year or so. Of the ones that I've read, \\"The Bark of the Bog Owl\\" is the one geared for the youngest age group.  <br /> <br />The book is perfect for parents to read to their kids. I am a big advocate of kids being read to because some of my fondest memories are of being curled up in the rocking chair with my mom while she read books we borrowed from the library. I would have eaten this up at that age. <br /> <br />The only disappointment I had about \\"Bark of the Bog Owl\\" is how the story turned out. Through the first 3/4ths of the book it was developing well. It felt unique and indiviual. Then the story spins into a parallel of the story of David from the Bible. Bible stories aren't a bad thing, but when I want to read them I'll read the Bible. So I found that to be a bit of a letdown. <br /> <br />To Jonathan Roger's credit, however, he allowed himself to add enough unique details that it was still enjoyable. Unfortunately, if he continues with the David parallel, it becomes too easy to guess what trials will happen next.	2004-09-23
US	19783408	R2JFA3E254BVE9	0399242562	236027041	Shadowmancer	Books	2	11	13	N	N	...	The publishers are trying to market this book as an alternative to Harry Potter for the families who think HP is promoting witchcraft and devil worship (a misguided assumption, btw). Unfortunately, several things make this book unsuitable. <br /> <br />The first problem with the marketing is the assumption that since all Harry Potter is fantasy, all fantasy is like Harry Potter. So a \\"Christian\\" fantasy novel will be a nice alternative. That is like saying that The Chipmunk's Christmas Album is like The Messiah because you play them around Christmas time. Harry Potter is about a kid who doesn't know who he is or who he is meant to be, and starts to find out at magic school. Shadowmancer is about a group of kids battling dark forces. <br /> <br />The second problem is that the Harry Potter books are written beautifully, both in wording and construction. Shadowmancer fails on both levels. The conversation is rather clunky and the plot feels less like it was planned, and more like the author went with the wind. <br /> <br />I can only really reccomend this book for parents who are looking for a fantasy book that has a heavy emphasis on Christianity. One of the main characters (the main \\"Christian\\" in the book) speak the scripture fifty percent of the time he talks. <br /> <br />However, The Chronicles of Narnia is a lot better. If you're looking for a more contemporary fantasy (from a Christian perspecive) that's quality try Dragonspell by Donita K Paul or Raising Dragons by Bryan Davis.	2004-09-06

I liked the characters, and the story flow was fitting. I liked many of the points the story made about life. I would suggest this book for people who are still questing for what their life journey is. <br /> <br />I only gave this book three stars because of certain features. The book reminded me a lot of The Little Prince by Antoine DeSaint Exupery. While the point of the two books differ sleightly, the tone and feel is very simular. However, The Little Prince has a charm that The Alchemist lacks. Plus, The Alchemist is good for one read, but a re-read is quite unnessisary. With The Little Prince you want to go back time after time to read. <br /> <br />The Alchemist is good if it was a gift or you are giving a gift. Otherwise just pick it up at the library or used for a few cents.	2004-09-06
US	19783408	R3BP6B3Z42BLMP	0441003257	624269601	Good Omens	Books	4	3	3	N	N	...	Two factors led me to purchase \\"Good Omens\\" several years ago. First, there was a nice phrase on the cover comparing it to \\"Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy\\" (which I covet nicely), and second, Terry Pratchett was a co-author (who's books I've enjoyed previously).  <br /> <br />Then there were several factors that prevented me from reading the book until just a few days ago. First because it was not just written by Pratchett, but also by Gaiman. I don't have anything against Gaiman, but generally speaking, co-authored books tend to flop more often than not. Also I realized that the subject of the book delt with the theme of the apocalypse, which these days is a tired subject and usually turns out lame. Well, I can honestly say that I was wrong about any of my apprihenson.  <br /> <br />The book was a laugh from begining to end and the characters were amusing. <br /> <br />I was impressed with how Gaiman/Pratchett handled religion. They got their laughs from both sides without slipping into mockery or trying to disprove anything. It's all to easy for a non-religious author, when writing about it, to be all superior to the religion, or to take the side of hell. That doesn't happen here. <br /> <br />I would definately think that any fan of humorous fiction would appriciate this book. Uptight Christians may find themselves pointing out certain theological innacuracies or too offended that Crowley (the demon character) isn't demonic enough to enjoy the book, however, on the same hand some Satanists might be offended by certain things, too, so it all evens out.	2004-09-01
US	19783408	ROQ39TTVDMDB7	0316769487	862964341	The Catcher in the Rye	Books	5	0	1	N	N	.	I read a lot of the reviews here and I can understand why someone wouldn't like this book. <br /> <br />That wasn't my personal experience, however. Even before I read \\"Catcher In The Rye\\" I knew that my favorite books were ones with which I become intimate with the characters and they become your best friend for the duration of the read. I have read great books that I've enjoyed that were written better and plotted better, but don't touch me quite the same way because I didn't connect with the characters. <br /> <br />The book has a strong stream of consiousness feel. Not to an extreme extent like William Faulkner, but \\"Catcher In The Rye\\" feels like Holden's deep thoughts and feelings on paper in the chronological order that he thought them. He doesn't hold anything back. <br /> <br />There is a lot of angst represented in the pages. If it was just angst I probably wouldn't have enjoyed the book as much as I did. However, his friendship with is sister Pheobe is beautiful. It shows that he does care about certain things in life. <br /> <br />His angst has two faces. The first face is the most typical teen type. A general, unrational, and frivilous hate directed at anything and everybody that irks him. The second kind is the educated kind. He can put into rational words why he is angry at something. <br /> <br />The example that comes to my mind first is his distaste of the oral presentation class. Holden verbalized how he got constantly frustrated when speakers who went with their passion and strayed from the topic, but gave great heartfelt speaches, got low grades.  <br /> <br />In a way, this book is like a photograph. It's a snapshot of a certain period of time in a person's life. Not everything feels resolved, but it's like a picture of a pitcher throwing a baseball. You see the pitcher's throw, but you don't see the result. Was it a strike out? Did the batter hit a home run? All we know is that a pitch was thrown. In this way the book concludes. <br /> <br />While I can't go and hang out with Holden after work, this will undoubtedly be a book I read again over the years.	2004-08-24

Philip Baker outlines 10 kinds of Christians, their positive points and their negative aspects. He gives each trait a name, like \\"Theological Theo\\" or \\"End Time Ed\\" and describes how each help the church and how they hinder it. <br /> <br />Basically, this book tries to balance the extremes with biblical truth. The nice thing about the book is that MOST traits he doesn't out and out dismiss. He aknowledges the need for theology (Theological Theo), emotion (Penticostal Pamela), study of spirital warfare (Demonic Dave), among others, but says that extremism can be more harmful than benificial. <br /> <br />And he doesn't go out trying to please everyone. When a trait is bad, he calls it a spade. Baker couldn't find much good to say about putting on a fake front (Plastic Pete), or judging people constantly (Judgemental Jill). Instead of just pointing fingers he offers good solutions.  <br /> <br />The book is fairly short (shy of 140 pages) so don't expect an in-depth study. However it says a lot of things which should have been said before now.	2004-08-23

The first was the delightful \\"The Old Silent\\", which I think is better than \\"Man With A Load of Mischief\\", but not by much. <br /> <br />\\"MWALOM\\" introduces us to the main characters in the series, Melrose Plant and Richard Jury. They drive the books with appearances by other reoccuring characters. <br /> <br />The plot was very good, however, the best part of this novel was Jury's interaction with The James'. That scene of him showing the kids how to track footprints in the snow is priceless.	2004-08-08

My boss at work knew I enjoyed Agatha Christie and (after using a derrogatory comment) suggested I try something better. After getting over the sleight of Christie, I agreed to try one of Grimes' books. <br />  <br /> So my boss brought &quot;The Old Silent&quot; in for me to read. <br />  <br /> I realized that I was begining in the middle of a series, so I wasn't too put off by not knowing certain things that weren't explained (like the relationships between many of the characters in the begining). <br />  <br /> However, even not having any Grimes experience before this book, I got a fairly quick grasp of the main characters, Jury and Plant, and enjoyed them a lot. The plot was practically non-existant through the majority of the novel, but Grimes skill in painting characters that I cared about still forced me to turn the page even when I didn't give two craps about the plot. <br />  <br /> After reading the book, I went out to Goodwill and picked up every book I could find by Grimes and have started &quot;Man With A Load of Mischief,&quot; to start at the begining. <br />  <br /> The actual plot of &quot;The Old Silent&quot; would take 15 pages of a Christie novel (Whom I still love... despite my boss implying that reading Grimes would show me the tom-foolery of Christie). But the characters drive the book home far more that most other mystery books. <br />  <br /> Highly reccomended for everyone.	2004-08-05
