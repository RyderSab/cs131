Michael Connelly's \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" has rekindled my interest in the legal thriller. He may or may not have reinvented the legal thriller...but he certainly has refreshed it to an amazing degree and sets a new standard for the genre.<br /><br />The Lincoln lawyer of the title is Mickey Haller...so named because his office is his Lincoln Towncar tricked out with fax, phone, internet, folding desk and files. Chauffeured by a former client working off his fee, Mickey does business while commuting between the numerous court houses in Los Angeles.<br /><br />On the surface Mickey appears to be the stereotypical sleazy defense attorney. His two ex-wives and young daughter are still fond of him (wife number two is his case manager)...he does his share of pro bono work...and is fiercely honorable in his own way. So beneath the surface of the lawyer with bus bench advertising, whose clientele are hookers, drug dealers, scam artists and assorted LA lowlifes is a flawed and complex character.<br /><br />This practice provides a decent living (he has a home \\"with a million dollar view and a million one mortgage\\"), but not what the esteemed law firm pull down.<br /><br />His chance at the brass ring (the franchise client) turns up when a rich Beverly Hills real estate broker is pinched for attempted rape and murder. Mickey feels this may be an unusual client for him---an accused who is actually innocent. The fee is huge and the checks do not bounce.<br /><br />Naturally the case swerves in different directions and Mickey is compelled to reevaluate the veracity of his profession and the viable aspects of the law itself.<br /><br />\\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" has plenty of deduction and suspense, compelling ethical dilemmas, characters with depth and texture and razor sharp dialogue.<br /><br />Mr. Connelly draws precise portraits of the individuals and their motivations. Mickey's audacious scheme drives a slide rule perfect plot that leads to a turbulent climactic encounter followed by a stupefying revelation.<br /><br />\\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" proves that crime novels can be art. It deserves the careful reading its plot demands.tic encounter followed by a stupefying revelation. <br /> <br />\\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" proves that crime novels can be art.

His 1994 stand-alone \\"Shoedog\\" was out-of-print until last fall in paperback....great news!<br /><br />There are no good guys in this tale of violence, extreme betrayal and social realism. Every character is morally questionable. Like great film-noir, the cast is either anti-hero or villain.<br /><br />After drifting worldwide for seventeen years, Constantine decides to hitchhike back to DC. He accepts a ride from an older hood called Polk (everyone in \\"Shoedog\\" goes by one name).<br /><br />Outside DC, Polk needs to make a stop to \\"collect some dough.\\"<br /><br />That stop sets a dreadfully dark caper in motion for Constantine.<br /><br />A dual liquor robbery in DC on payday...two inside men on both jobs and a driver. Well cased and set up...it looks okay...and no one has a chance to say no.<br /><br />In the great noir tradition a woman upsets loyalties and outsiders are after Polk.<br /><br />The d&eacute;nouement is stunning and will resound in your mind for an extensive period.<br /><br />Packed with remarkable dialogue, suspense, treachery, fanatical duplicity and filled with superb pop culture references, \\"Shoedog\\" is best read in black and white.	2005-08-22

In his fortieth novel Elmore Leonard takes us back to 1930's-era Oklahoma in \\"The Hot Kid.\\"<br /><br />The kid is Carl (Carlos) Webster, who became a US Deputy Marshall at age twenty-one...his goal is be \\"America's most famous lawman.\\"<br /><br />\\"If I have to pull my weapon, I shoot to kill,\\" is his trademark calling card. And, he is quite the lady's man as well.<br /><br />The villain of the piece is millionaire's son, Jack Belmont...as bad as they come...but not a candidate for The Mensa Society. As a teenager he tried to blackmail his father about his mistress---when that failed, he kidnapped the mistress and was surprised when she recognized him. His goal is to be Public Enemy Number 1.<br /><br />True Detective Magazine writer Tony Antonelli is the chronicler of the events that aid Webster's rise to fame. Carl Webster always makes certain to get credit when he shoots someone in the line of duty.<br /><br />Like many of Mr. Leonard's works, a stunning ensemble cast vividly emerges to propel the story along with the inevitable showdowns, gunfights and hair-raising turns. Sardonic, witty and sharp dialogue enlivens the narrative.<br /><br />The so-called heroes are not that much different from the criminals...there are not a lot of noble ambitions on either side of the law. Moral ambiguity and hard-boiled cynicism rule the day.<br /><br />Nonstop action, sly humor, and the cinematic portraits of the women whose desire is to be a \\"gun moll\\" of a famous criminal are other high points in this rousing tale.<br /><br />Elmore Leonard, one of our most acclaimed crime writers has hit the bull's-eye once again.	2005-07-16

He remains a relentless, smart, hard working, compassionate, fundamentally decent detective.

DNA is available from the murder weapon...and they get an immediate match.<br /><br />They both feel there are enough inconsistencies in the match's history to question whether he is the perp.<br /><br />As they work the case they uncover the crime's heartbreaking effects for the victim's family. These unsolved mysteries can haunt a department...often defining the police force that cannot resolve them.<br /><br />Even with the tools unavailable in 1988, it still takes dogged legwork, cop's instinct and long grinding hours to decipher the case.

He is part of the Jack Donovan Orchestra of Note...playing an extended gig at the upscale Claremont Hotel in Oakland.<br /><br />Upon arrival, Berkeley student Gail Prentice entices Ray into helping her score her prize winning piano piece for full orchestra. Part of the prize is a performance by Japan's Pan Pacific Orchestra.<br /><br />Ray agrees and enters into a world of betrayal, deceit, double crosses, murder and political intrigue.<br /><br />Nazi sympathizers, a former lover from twenty years past, Sally Rand's Nude Ranch, Heinold's First and Last Chance Saloon, the Lindy Hop, Japanese diplomats, lime phosphates are just a few of the people, places and lingo that transport the reader solidly into the big band era and lifestyle. An era when what musicians loved to play was what the public loved to hear.<br /><br />The book comes with a CD of original big band music composed by Mr. Holmes. Clues are contained in the music...I, myself, was far too obtuse to locate said clues. However the CD has dominated my player for the past 300 miles.<br /><br />No matter...the story is about something more ominous and disturbing than a murder, but to tell more would diminish the pleasure of the denouement.<br /><br />\\"Swing\\" is right on key and not to be missed.	2005-04-24

John Katzenbach has assembled an authentic &quot;Cuckoo's Nest&quot; of characters inside Western State Mental Hospital in his chilling thriller, &quot;The Madman's Tale.&quot;<br /><br /> Narrator (C-Bird), both witness and schizophrenic whose hold on mental normalcy and self-preservation is tenuous, revisits the nightmare that took place twenty years ago.<br /><br /> His narrative rotates between present day in first person and his third person memories.<br /><br /> In 1979 a rape/murder inside the asylum brings in prosecuting attorney Lucy Jones (who has three unsolveds with similar profiles) to investigate. Lucy herself is a victim of a similar malicious crime.<br /><br /> Her initial act is unorthodox; enlisting two inmates (C-Bird and Peter the Fireman) to aid her as &quot;they are the only ones I am certain are not guilty.&quot; Creating additional tension is a minimally cooperative and reluctant hospital management.<br /><br /> Uncovering the killer hiding inside the institution is a most intriguing premise. There are no rules for pursuing a murderer in a mental institution where &quot;the mad know the truth and the sane cannot comprehend it.&quot;<br /><br /> The serial killer circles around them, committing two additional murders during the investigation.<br /><br /> Mr. Katzenbach creates an uneasy atmosphere filled with evil, darkness and an engrossing sense of foreboding.<br /><br /> The unfortunate, unlikely heroes are sympathetic characters that you worry and care about. You cannot anticipate what will happen next.<br /><br /> This tale will linger in your mind long after the final page. It commands your attention and has a terrific conclusion.	2004-08-01

Andea Camilleri's Silvio Montalbano series has been best seller material in Europe for years----just recently translated for the U.S. market.<br />Camilleri's reserved and nimble writing style loses nothing in translation.<br />Montalbano is a highly respected, cultivated Sicilian police inspector.<br />In \\"The Shape of Water,\\" the body of a local, well-connected politico is discovered with his pants around his ankles in a rough area populated by hookers and drug dealers. Cause of death appears to be heart failure---the vic had a history of heart ailments.<br />Montalbano's supervisors pressure him to do a swift signed, sealed and delivered natural causes ruling. Many little things bother the inspector---so he pursues the case.<br />A generous amount of eccentric, off-center and droll characters abound----even the garbage men possess Ph.D.s.<br />Montalbano is a heady, witty, subtle, cynical investigator; not the pistol packing, bare-knuckles type.<br />It is an inventive, clever, smart police procedural with three follow-ups. I am glad I discovered them and look forward to the entire series.	2003-12-18

The First Lady is Director of the CIA.<br />A extremely intelligent, well-trained and highly motivated assassin is killing conservative, right wing members of government and the media. He uses poison, firearms and explosives with equal competence---all without leaving a trace---so well in fact it appears he must have been trained by a very secret government agency.<br />Will Lee has zero tolerance for inter-agency turf wars and makes certain the CIA, FBI, DEA, ATF, et al share info and cooperate in order to catch the serial killer.<br />Will Lee is the most interesting personality Mr. Woods has created. Unfortunately he stays in the background in \\"Capital Crimes.\\"<br />The stars here are a pair of FBI Special Agents. Their relentless, clever and astute investigative work in the trackdown drives the plot.<br />Good subplot featuring a jailed disgraced former CIA agent who will provide invaluable information in exchange for a presidential pardon.<br />The two threads meld into a classic finale---the getaway vehicle is destroyed, but no sign of a body.

Just too preposterous---well beyond the limits of my ability to suspend disbelief.<br />Like James Patterson, it appears Mr. Cussler is doing less and less of the actual writing---and phoning in his part.<br />Where is Dirk Pitt when you really need him?	2003-10-18

Like his \\"The Pelican Brief\\" and \\"A Time to Kill,\\" it is complex and densely plotted.<br />Both sides in a multimillion-dollar tobacco suit have monitored all the potential jurors and chosen what they think are the most favorable twelve. But, you can never be 100% certain.<br />With stakes this high neither side is against manipulating the jury---pressure, cajoling, and bribery all appear to be fair game. Every jury finds a leader---on this jury the leader (Nicholas Easter) has schemed to get on and has a cunning accomplice (Marlee) on the outside. They have an agenda, are well financed and very motivated---and are characters shrouded in mystery.<br />The unfolding story line is how the plaintiff, defense and the inside man attempt to exploit the jury to their end. The characters are positively three-dimensional. The jurors' backgrounds, motivations, failings and vulnerabilities are brought to life without tedious detail.<br />There are no absolutely good guys---the members of the defense are particularly despicable. Their venture to unearth the background on Nicholas and Marlee is terrific cat and mouse and a substantial subplot.<br />The jury tampering, background chase and trial meld into a riveting conclusion.<br />A terrific ride and satisfying finale.	2003-10-16

They come alive from page one with all their flaws, anguish, torment and personal demons.<br />The whodunit is cleverly resolved, but \\"Mystic River\\" is much more than just a mystery story.

Tracy's stylishly written debut novel, \\"Monkeewrench.\\"<br />It is peopled with vividly drawn intelligent characters and presented from multiple POV's. The three story lines converge for a nice payoff with the loose ends tied up.<br />The high concept premise (murders replicate a yet to be released violent video game) centers around two parallel investigations.<br />The unpredictable plot accelerates at a good pace.<br />Everyone at Monkeewrench (game's creator) seems to have a secret. All five partners are filled with idiosyncrasies---they all have permits to carry and an innate distrust of the law. At one time or another any of them could be suspected as the serial killer.<br />The dialogue is realistic and peppered with wry and dry humor. The mix of computer geeks, small town cops and big city (Minneapolis) law enforcement works.<br />Glad to learn this is the start of a four book series, as I want to know more about this cast of characters.	2003-06-07

Iris Johansen's \\"Body of Lies\\" is a fairly entertaining novel.<br />The cat and mouse aspect is well done, as the hunted do not use super human powers to keep on the move. As the story progresses, a ticking clock subplot propels the action.<br />A secret society lends an almost credible conspiracy theory to the mix.<br />Throw in a resourceful hardboiled British bodyguard with a dubious background, a corrupt Senator, a seemingly average reporter, a skillful assassin and a covert research project involving fuel cells and things move rapidly.<br />Forensic sculptor Eve Duncan is terrific when doing her job recreating the face on the skull of an unknown murder victim. When fretting about her romance everything bogs down and becomes a pitiful soap opera.<br />Colorful villains, some wolves in sheep's clothing and the nefarious secret organization keep Eve and Atlanta detective Joe Quinn hopping and the pages turning.<br />The ending was too pat.	2003-06-05

He provides the comedy of errors.<br />It is a good big city police procedural. As expected, the crew from the 87th is in top form and the dialogue is crisp and provocative.<br />Always entertaining, consistent activity and lots of the equal opportunity bigot Ollie Weeks---perhaps a bit too much humor and not enough drama---but still fun.	2003-06-05

While \\"A Place of Execution\\" by Val McDermid was nominated for the 2001 Best Novel Edgar, it was the high praise from Michael Connelly and Steve Hamilton that compelled me to read it.<br />It is an excellent police procedural, albeit quite Dickensian. The two protagonists are skillfully drawn as are the secondary cast members.<br />And you are realistically transported to the English country villages of the early sixties---with some great pop culture references as well.<br />The plot proceeds at a deliberate pace due to much backtracking. That is very helpful due to the number of important bit players.<br />The book requires effort on the part of the reader, and it does pay off.<br />Overall I thought it could have been shorter and am not driven to read more of her books.<br />Back to Michael Connelly and Steve Hamilton.	2003-06-02

No one is quite what he or she appears as Detective Tom McMichael and his partner Hector Paz endeavor to unravel the truth about the murder of eighty-four year old San Diego patriarch Pete Braga.<br />There are three generations of bad blood between the Portuguese Bragas and the Irish McMichaels. McMichael's basic decency and personal code eliminate any chance of a clouded judgement.<br />There is no shortage of suspects: City Council members, the Catholic Diocese, a smuggling ring, the police force, members of either family---any of them could have done it.<br />As McMichael exhumes the past to explain the current crime, you can never anticipate what is coming next.<br />Each and every clue seems conflicting...altering newfound clarity into opaqueness in the turn of a page.<br />Wonderful misdirection.

Michael Connelly's ninth Harry Bosch novel, \\"Lost Light\\" is told in the first person, giving nice insights into Harry's mind and the demons he fights. In the first person, Michael Connelly feels: \\"the writer cannot hold anything back without being dishonest.\\"<br />\\"Lost Light\\" is hardboiled with quick pacing, ingenious plot twists, intrigue and strong character development. The prose is lean and powerful, with a few overt homages to Raymond Chandler.<br />Michael Connelly has said that: \\"Harry Bosch is the prism I see LA thru,\\" and LA remains a viable character in \\"Lost Light.\\"<br />Harry Bosch has left the LAPD, making \\"Lost Light\\" Michael Connelly's initial PI novel. Harry revisits an unsolved murder case. Add to this inner mystery, the outer mysteries of a $2 million heist at a movie location and a missing FBI agent. LAPD, FBI and an Anti-Terrorist unit all warn Harry to keep out, making his quest all the more intense.<br />The presumably straightforward plot builds to a sequence of surprises, both in the investigation and Harry's personal life.<br />Harry Bosch never disappoints.

The final 20% needs a suspension of disbelief equal to that of a James Bond movie. No matter, it is an entertaining ride.<br />Essentially a techo-thriller featuring a ticking clock with a cat and mouse chase (the hunted hunting the hunters). Creatively written, filled with nonstop tension and shifting loyalties, it is easy to get hooked.<br />\\"High Wire\\" truly deserves its Edgar nomination.<br />I liked the way Mr. Majd developed his characters. The protagonists are resourceful, the villains especially devious and their crime quite ingenious.<br />Looking forward to more in this series.	2003-03-29

Cannell's third Shane Scully novel, \\"Hollywood Tough\\" is as implausible as was his \\"A Team\\" with protagonists more resilient than his Jim Rockford. Be that as it may, if you suspend disbelief, it is big fun.<br />The cop lingo, street jargon and snappy dialogue alone are worth the price of admission.<br />Noteworthy scene setting and character descriptions (\\"'Champagne' Tony Valentine was managing to stay just inside the boundaries of fashion comedy.\\") abound.<br />Mr. Cannell knows Hollywood and uses his insider knowledge to paint amusing and self-effacing portraits of the movie biz and its oh-so-Hollywood-execs.<br />Either of the two major plots could carry a novel on its own. That makes for some clumsiness, confusion and too many handily convenient coincidences to move the plot forward...at times convoluted, but always entertaining.<br />Titling each chapter in a wry, tongue-in-cheek fashion is a nifty touch.	2003-03-15

Daniel Silva's \\"The Confessor\\" is tightly written with an intricate plot and subplots...a thinking man's international espionage thriller. Full of subtle touches that invigorate the plot...it is a sophisticated novel.<br />Protagonist Gabriel Allon, an art restorer/sleeper Mossad agent is chosen to investigate the murder of an author (and former Israeli agent) whose research unearths the Vatican's dirty secret. The Vatican's silence during WWII shows complicity between the Vatican and the Nazis that furthered the Holocaust.<br />While searching for the murderer Gabriel is hunted by both the assassin and a shadow organization within the Vatican. That organization (Vera Crux) will stop at nothing to keep the secret hidden.<br />Connecting the dots, Mossad uncovers a plot to assassinate the current Pope who desires to make the Vatican's covert files public.<br />The intrigue is intense with a multitude of richly drawn characters. The characters are introduced gradually and are well developed, eliminating the confusion often found in complicated plots. Gabriel's recapping his progress to various contacts is a skillful device that keeps the reader on track with the protagonist.<br />The author's notes at the conclusion, where facts take over from fiction, make the story all the more chilling.	2003-03-13

Griffin is the third (of eight) in his \\"Badge of Honor\\" series and it is the charm. Easily the fastest moving of the first three.<br />The central characters are more familiar and their roles more clearly defined.<br />W.E.B. Griffin is a terrific storyteller. He gives just enough back-story to eliminate any confusion for those who pick up the series at random. I recommend reading in order---to see the players evolve. He is also a master at interior dialogue.<br />Two seemingly unrelated shootings, a Mafia hit and a murdered cop supply the mystery. However what keeps you turning pages is his accurate portrayal of the workings of a police department; the loyalty, fealty, courage and camaraderie that connect the force to a common goal.<br />The ending leaves a \\"more to come\\" feeling...one more reason to read installment four.	2003-03-01

It is a fast read that captivated me immediately. A great whodunit where the unexpected is par for the course.<br />There is a bit of Travis McGee in McKnight, a fiercely loyal non-PI surrounded by an outstanding supporting cast (especially Leon Prudell).<br />There is plenty of fear in WOTWM as Russian mobsters, DEA types and a psychotic villain may or may not be what they appear to be.

The different paths Clay and the three associates who received the largesse that came with moving from the Public Defender's office to private practice is telling.<br />As with many of his novels, the conclusion is less than fulfilling. However, it is a marvelous ride, and the journey trumps the destination; making for a most entertaining read.<br />It is not deep and ponderous; it is simply good escapist enjoyment.	2003-02-21

The villains are high-ranking politicos, plus one evil gunsel.<br />A credible resolution that opens the possibility for continued pairing of Kerney and his son.<br />This seventh book in the Kevin Kerney series is just as fresh as the first---one reason being that Kerney has held various positions in New Mexico law enforcement in different locales.<br />Great series by a most under discovered writer.	2003-01-02

Society bandleader Peter Duchin and Edgar Award winning author John Morgan Wilson team up and give us a smoothly written little mystery in \\"Blue Moon.\\"<br />Set in the San Francisco of 1963, they blend history with fiction in an action packed noirish plot.<br />Celebrities and pop icons of the day from Joe DiMaggio to Andy Warhol---Jackie Kennedy to Jack Kerouac---Truman Capote to Willie Mays pop up along with a major part for Herb Caen.<br />It has the feel of Archy McNally meeting up with The Thin Man---snappy dialogue, complex plot, lotsa characters with agendas, many cocktails, dead bodies and an alto sax playing San Francisco Inspector who sits in with the protagonist's (Philip Damon) band.<br />It is an excellent amateur sleuth whodunit peopled with intriguing characters. The atmosphere of sixties San Francisco is truly captured.<br />There are many laughs along the way. \\"Blue Moon\\" is big fun.	2002-12-29

Jefferson Parker's \\"Black Water\\" is the third in the Merci Rayborn series.<br />She is an Orange County (CA) Sheriff Department detective. She is a flawed, difficult, complex woman filled with contradictions and self-doubt---just a great character.<br />Even as we know the suspect is innocent, T. Jeff holds your interest with a suspenseful, intricate plot whose pace accelerates as new clues appear and the pieces of the puzzle start to fit.<br />His extensive research into human memory loss adds authenticity to the story. He weaves in the character-developing subplot without interfering with the main plot.<br />Merci must deal not only with finding the bad guys, but with headline seeking media types, skeptical colleagues, her boss and a DA looking for an easy case. Her procedural moves are convincing and lead both her and the wrongly accused suspect to Russian Organized Crime (ROC) in Southern California.<br />There is more character interplay in this than the preceding two, especially between Merci and her new partner, Paul Zamora.<br />T. Jeff is an articulate, fluid and descriptive writer with another winner.	2002-12-26

Witnesses and inspectors keep turning up dead.<br />After Corso connects seemingly unrelated events (murders) including one that strikes close to home---everything circumstantially points to Belagula.<br />Corso unearths a paper trail that verifies the connection. Turning an insider is all thats needed to convict Belagula.<br />G.M. Ford, an excellent storyteller, gives you a nonstop, rapidly moving plot with well-developed characters. Once I got all the players clearly identified, it was impossible to put the book down.<br />A couple of the bad guys are Elmore Leonardish, and the primary villains are absolutely loathsome.<br />The appearance of the US Attorney General was a bit much and the ending too neat and tidy---but the ride to the conclusion was thrilling.

Jance brings the lead characters of her two series together.<br />Seattle Special Investigator for the Washington Attorney General, J.P.

The murder \\"weapon\\" will truly make you stop and think.<br />When a second body turns up the territorial feud ceases and the two protagonists work together to find whodunit.<br />J.A. Jance writes in a fluid style that you glide thru. It is solid plot, well paced, with likeable characters. It's a complex, suspenseful story dominated by J.P. and Joanna. The scenes are beautifully set. The introspective subplots do not detract from the investigation.<br />J.P.'s part is told in the first person, while Sheriff Brady's is third person narrative---quirky, but it works.<br />After reading \\"Partner in Crime\\" you will be checking your artificial sweetener packets carefully.	2002-12-18
US	52009378	R3CDUZ0HSB0RHI	0525946896	712732369	Hornet Flight	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Electrifying espionage action.	Ken Follett's \\"Hornet Flight\\" is a fast paced page burner set at the start of WWII. With locales in Denmark and Great Britain, it blends fact and fiction. Mr. Follett is at his best when the setting is WWII.<br />The plot shows how the heroic action of a few individuals behind the lines can alter the outcome of war. The Nazis are still the ultimate bad guys in fact and fiction and it is always fun to see them outwitted.<br />The characters are quite strong, believable and they really come alive.<br />There are enough twists and turns to make you wonder if the protagonists will triumph---as these Nazis are not portrayed as buffoons---they are worthy adversaries.<br />While there are some predicable resolutions, overall it is a fascinating, irresistible read filled with plenty of tension.	2002-12-16

The characters (on both sides of the law) are well developed and most credible.<br />Mr. Pearson did a couple of years of research on this one and it shows. It is based on an actual Seattle arson case and the procedural and technical aspects really ring true.<br />Seattle comes to life on every page with wonderful descriptive passages.<br />This is a terrific series and Mr. Pearson is masterful at forensic detail, without making it tedious. Highly recommended.	2002-12-16

He is one of the most descriptive writers (Sample passages: \\"The silver limousine appeared in the fog as if born from it.\\" \\"They say we have our memories, thought Jim, but really our memories have us.\\") and sometimes gets carried away---slowing down the plot movement.<br />Excellent suspense and a terrific overall plot---with fully fleshed out characters.<br />As usual, Orange County is a major character. This time it appears someone is dumping chemicals in the harbor. This could ruin property values and allow developers an [inexpensive] price, permitting them to raze everything and create some pricey real estate.<br />Uncovering a murderer seems to be a major key to locating the illegal waste disposers. I dismissed the murderer as a suspect early on and fell for most of the false leads.<br />It is a good book that would be great if shorter and more to the point. It's not a page-turner.<br />T. Jeff is a wonderful writer and storyteller.	2002-12-12

Mr. Flagler used his personal fortune to make this dream come true.<br />When he first arrived in Florida he was the second wealthiest man in the country. His fortune was made in partnership with John Rockefeller and the creation of Standard Oil.<br />The ingenuity necessary to accomplish this task is absolutely incredible. The obstacles overcome included the brutal weather (heat and hurricanes), having to import every item from drinking water to food to nails.<br />As I read the story I found the task more impossible with each accomplishment along the way. The closer they got to their objective, the more unattainable I thought the goal was. They truly did the impossible.<br />That Mr. Flagler and his crew succeeded is a testament to the pioneer spirit of America.<br />Dr. Standiford has written a fast paced book. He is a wonderful story teller. It is where truth and fact is so improbable, that one could not make up a superior fictional account.<br />The photographs are a wonderful addition.<br />With all the scandals in business today, it is enlightening to read the story of a man who put his reputation and own money on the line for what he believed in.<br />As Dr. Standiford said: \\"Henry Flagler evolved from acquisitive robber baron to creator.\\"<br />Henry Flagler may not have discovered Florida, but he saw all the state's possibilities and created the framework and infrastructure that made Florida livable.	2002-12-08

The plot accelerates from the cover to the conclusion at a furious pace.<br />Protagonist Henry Pierce is a Stanford educated computer genius, whose company is ready to patent a revolutionary molecular delivery system that could transform the medical profession. But if Henry can't get the multimillion-dollar funding shortly, his rivals will prevail. Henry's maniacal focus on perfecting the system has destroyed his personal life.<br />He has moved to an apartment. His new phone number previously belonged to an escort and is still posted on her web site. Messages for her accumulate to the point where he suspects something untoward has occurred.<br />Proving that no good deed goes unpunished, Henry is caught in an unimaginable conspiracy as he attempts to locate her and request the number be removed from the site. Henry is an ordinary man suddenly caught up in something with which he has no experience. The law of unintended consequences takes over and Henry learns that even paranoids have real enemies.<br />Mr. Connelly is the master of the sly plot twist. I fell for every red herring, misdirection and false lead---and did not figure out whodunit until it was painfully obvious. I was glued to the book from the compelling beginning to the action-packed finale. Do not miss this high concept thriller.	2002-10-20

The characters are well defined. You get to know them all extremely well.<br />It is written in the first person. That allows the reader to learn plot point before the protagonist (ex cop Elena Estes.)<br />Elena was let go from the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office after her aggressive action on a bust got a fellow cop killed. So, she has her demons to wrestle and begins the healing process of personal redemption in a kidnapping case.<br />There are enough twists and turns and false leads that at one time or another I was certain of whodunit and was wrong on all occasions. Great deceptions.<br />It is a great thriller set in the world of competitive horse jumping and dressage. I have zero interest in those equestrian sports, but the book is so well written I could not put it down. A solid \\"Bee Plus.\\"	2002-10-10

A fast-paced plot that makes for a swift read.<br />The plot pitches the reader to the climax thru a succession of increasing danger points that P.I. Sunny Randall, her client, her archangel Spike and ex-husband overcome.<br />The villain is a twisted, creepy psychologist who is stalking and manipulating his former wife (Sunny's client, best selling author Melanie Joan Hall.) Seems he has a history of terrorizing and manipulating his female patients.<br />Mr. Parker does a nifty job of developing the characters by exploring their relationships mainly via dialog with a minimum of narrative passages.<br />Big fun.	2002-10-08

The arrival of a new Archy McNally is always a welcome event.<br />While \\"McNally's Alibi\\" is the easily the most densely plotted of the eleven in the series, it still retains its \\"mystery-lite\\" quality and is great fun.<br />It is a tongue-in-cheeky romp amongst the rich and infamous in Palm Beach.<br />Highway Patrol Lt. Georgia O'Hara is introduced and is a character I hope will stay in the series. She is a much better paramour for Archy then the tedious Connie Garcia.<br />Double dealing, double crossing, a sting operation as well as a counter sting revolve around the whereabouts of the original manuscript of a Truman Capote novel that an ardent rich collector desires.<br />Archy and his excellent supporting cast sort out the truth and lies and save the day.<br />A good time to be had for the reader.	2002-10-04

The pages fly by as the reader joins Harry in his quest.<br />Harry Bosch attacks this case with a vengeance that makes him an archangel for both the victim and Los Angeles.<br />The writing is crisp, literate, hardboiled and dark---yet sensitive. It is complex story with a riveting plot. We continue to learn more about Harry Bosch as Mr. Connelly shows the reader some of Harry's more subtle characteristics.<br />The ending is quite a surprise that had me talking to myself.

I cannot remember a read this good in a long long time.<br />It took a great deal of self-discipline not to reread it immediately after finishing it. I was torn between reading it as fast as possible to see how everything was resolved or limiting myself to a daily ration in order to savor it for an extended period.<br />Could not put it down and had to reread the last chapter at once.<br />The characters come alive and you feel a part of the story. I was drawn into the era as the settings seemed atmospherically perfect. The plot is intoxicating, and just when you think you have solved a part of it; you find you guessed incorrectly.<br />It is a wonderfully noirish, hard boiled tale. I felt the spirit of Raymond Chandler and hopes this becomes a movie. Mr. Diehl just gets better and better.<br />It was worth the five-year wait.	2002-03-18

The story unfolds in a logical and orderly fashion. The pacing is never forced.<br />The reader can feel the frustration, boredom and exasperation experienced by the POW's in Stalag 13. The conditions they existed under and lack of qualified doctors were truly horrendous.<br />The protagonist, Tommy Hart, is thrust into a situation he is unprepared for. His resourcefulness leads him to two allies in the British side of the POW camp. This trio gets some assistance from some unlikely sources.<br />As the book progresses, Tommy Hart finds people working against him on both the German and American sides. Realizing all is not as it seems, he is forced to rely on his own ingenuity.<br />In short, it is the triumph of an ordinary man acting in an extraordinary manner in an almost impossible situation.<br />It is an extremely powerful book with a moving ending.<br />This is a hard book for a movie to live up to.	2002-02-13

He is a glib, sarcastic, cynical realist. His retorts and thoughts bring grins, smiles and laughs to the reader. He has strong supporting cast in &quot;Up Country.&quot;<br />&quot;Up Country&quot; is part travelogue, part spy games, part fox and hounds chase. It is also a lengthy novel, so the characters are fully developed. The reader learns a lot about Paul Brenner and Viet Nam thru flashbacks as he tours many of the places where he served in the war. The scenes are brilliantly set.<br />His advesaries are in his own camp as well as the enemy's. Never is there a moment when he knows exactly who he can trust on his mission.<br />&quot;Up Country&quot; works on many levels, and the journey is better than the destination. However, once at the destination, just enough loose ends are left to suggest the possibility of a sequel.<br />For Paul Brenner fans, that is good news indeed.<br />Nelson Demille is just a wonderful writer who does his homework. A lot of research went into &quot;Up Country&quot; and that preparation is evident in every page. I could not put this one down.	2002-02-08

For me, the ending was a most unsatisfactory conclusion. It was as if Mr. Grisham either got tired or bored and just ended it. I have had that feeling with a couple of his titles.<br />Still, those initial 330 pages are well worth the price of admission. The ride is better than the destination---and that certainly is not a bad thing---and it is quite a ride.<br />Characters that I found most interesting kept appearing. One more intriguing the the next.<br />His red herrings continued to trick me, as I kept changing my deduction on who the villain was.<br />This is a fast read and would be a most pleasant way to spend a weekend.

This is easily her best mystery in the whodunit and plotting categories. Lots of red herrings and plenty of possible suspects.<br />It is her first one that takes place outside of Baltimore, and that was a minus for me. Having lived in Baltimore, I find her a great voice for that great city. Her books give me my Baltimore fix...so with 95% of the action Texas I was disappointed.<br />That said, this is a strong work and well worth reading. It truly shows how the author has grown as a mystery writer.<br />So, if Texas locations are what you like, this is a spectacular read.<br />I look forward her &quot;The Sugar House&quot; shortly.	2001-08-30

Jance writes with such a fluid style that I glide right thru her novels. Her books are easy to read and comprehend. I particularly enjoy the Joanna Brady series.<br />In &quot;Devil's Claw&quot; there are plenty of suspects to go around, a couple of running subplots and an ever growing cast of regulars.<br />J.A. Jance does a great job of filling in the background of the continuing characters...enough info to set their place and position for first time readers of the series; but not so much that familiar readers are bored or insulted with the data.<br />It's a pleasure to observe how the characters develop and grow as the series progresses. The scenic setting of Southern Arizona is always well done...you can almost see those great sunsets.<br />Plotting, character evolvement, red herrings all give the reader plenty of times to solve things along with Sheriff Brady.<br />J.A. Jance does a great job balancing the whodunit aspect with Sheriff Brady's personal life without detracting from the main plot. The reader also gets a good view of the &quot;unglamorous&quot; aspect of the sheriff's job...meetings, personel problems, budgets, civic speaking engagements and the like.<br />This is just a wonderful series, and &quot;Devil's Claw&quot; is a welcome addition to the Joanna brady legacy.	2001-08-30

I started on a Saturday and finished the next evening.<br />&quot;Hostage&quot; ensnares you as a reader...and you cannot stop reading. Neither can you stop guessing who is part of the double and triple crosses that stalk the protagonist( Jeff Talley).<br />It's one crisis after another...each brought to conclusion in a believable fashion. Quick time decision making, who to trust, who to doubt, when to go against the book, when to take the daring chance...carry the experienced former LA SWAT leader thru an intense twenty-four hours.<br />The villains are particularly unlikable...and you know that there are a lot like them out there. These miscreants are very real. Mr. Crais fully develops them, and they are to be feared.<br />Talley gets help from a least likely ally...one of the hostages, a ten year old boy (Thomas) who rises to the occasion. Thomas shows the boundaries one can push in a life and death situation.<br />I cannot say if this is Mr. Crais' finest effort or not. His writing is that good. I have gotten so much pleasure from his body of work, and was thrilled to have a new one by him. I do think it is as good as anything I have read this year. I rank &quot;Hostage&quot; up there with Michael Connelly's &quot;A Darkness More Than Night&quot;, Harlan Coben's &quot;Tell No One&quot; and Dennis Lehane's &quot;Mystic River&quot; from this year's releases thus far.<br />This could be a great movie, but don't know if I see Bruce Willis as Jeff Talley. It could just as easily be a case where the book is far better than the movie.<br />In either case I am glad I read the book. I will read it again.	2001-08-27

I will refrain from using lots of sports cliches to describe this book...but the temptation is there.<br />This is very good collection of mystery writers and (for reasons I fail to grasp) Mike Lupica. I have read the works of over half the authors and a big fan of some of them.<br />The book was a pleasant diversion from the normal selection of mysteries and thrillers I read...especially as the major league season winds down.<br />Most of the stories were quick reads with a couple of surprise endings. Short stories are a different way to enjoy a writer when you are used to the whole novel. It was amazing to see how well some of these novelists could develop characters and plot in such a short format.<br />I found the stories by Michael Connelly, Laura Lippman, Elmore Leonard, Henry Slesar, Troy Soos and Robert Parker the best. Other than the Lupica the only other one that I found lacking was the one by K.C. Constantine.	2001-08-22

It's tough to take over for a writer as loved as Lawrence Sanders, but Mr. Lardo is up to the challenge.<br />This time Archy's parents are away on a cruise and his female love interest is barely seen. That certainly keeps those characters fresh for future Mcnally exploits, and seems a good ploy to me.<br />Even his crony in the Palm Beach Police Department has a lower than usual profile this time. Archy's pal Binky has the biggest part among the usual recurring characters, so we get to share his misadventures.<br />It's the usual lighthearted romp among the rich and infamous on the island of Palm Beach. Lots of setup and many a red herring along the way, punctuated with a fair share of laughs.<br />If you are looking for a deep and complicated hardboiled noirish mystery, look elsewhere...but if a little tongue in cheek and mystery-lite sounds like a good change of pace, then &quot;McNally's Chance&quot; is for you.<br />It is fast read and an enjoyable book from start to finish.<br />Enjoy this one.	2001-08-08

It becomes a very good read if one is a Baltimore Oriole fan. And, if one is an Oriole fan old enough to remember the early days it is simply excellent.<br />The oral history told by those who made that history is just wonderful. Mr. Eisenberg has captured some great stories as the history of a once great franchise unfolds.<br />The memories are spectacular as we hear from the franchise superstars and the lesser known role players over 46 years. This is story telling at its best. One is reminded of so many players that were part of O's story...and they truly come to life.<br />The human side comes out as well and we are reminded of just how great a franchise it was and how it got that way. It should be required reading for every member of the current Oriole organization...they could learn something.<br />I too was amazed that Chuck Thomson and Jon Miller were not interviewed and that Bill O'Donnell not mentioned...they were the voices that we all knew.	2001-07-16
US	52009378	R38P7SJZP83DNH	0671871366	250848916	Deadly Sweet: Deadly Sweet	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Good read.	This one started off a bit slowly. The pace picked up, but it is a deliberate pace throughout.<br />The jacket had comparisons to Carl Hiaasen, but I did not really see that. Hiaasen's recent works have been peopled by characters that have become cartoonish and parodies. The characters in &quot;Deadly Sweet&quot; are far more plausable.<br />The main players are believeable and the plot makes sense. The comic element that Hiaasen brings is not present here, and to me that was a major plus.<br />It never becomes a fast read or a &quot;page turner&quot; in the strict sense. It progresses at a logical pace and the loose ends are tied up. The protagonists are easy to cheer for and it's easy to feel their losses along the way.<br />I enjoyed it. However, I felt the Hiaasen comparisons were off base, but that was a positive. Maybe reviewers think any novel set in Florida is Hiaasenesque.	2001-06-13
US	52009378	R4LDAIE1C47HP	0375500901	330117464	The Kill Artist	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Another strong thriller from Daniel Silva	Daniel Silva has yet to disappoint me. The action revolves around the Arab/PLO/Jewish conflict. As novels about that political situation are of little interest to me (my preference is the USA hardboiled detective), it takes an extraordinary tale to captivate me the way &quot;The Kill Artist&quot; did.<br />As with Mr. Silva's other novels, I could not put it down. It's one of those books you steal time for. The pages fly by.<br />The characters are richly portrayed and fairly complex. You get to know all of them. On both sides, the major players are flawed, and the reader must decide who truly wears the white hat. So much evil has been perpetuated on both sides...there is plenty of blame to spread around.<br />Excellent cat and mouse plotting. Great attention to detail in the spy versus spy aspect and the physical settings.<br />While it gets a bit muddy at the very end, I applaud this one and highly endorse it to those readers who are fascinated by thrillers that do not stretch credulity and place you as a reader in the middle of the action.<br />Mr. Silva is an excellent story teller, who does his homework.	2001-04-25
US	52009378	RK8Z9YHK81MKG	0425178536	600482946	Black Mountain	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Well done.	This is extremely well written and carefully crafted. A novel that is both a thriller and a whodunit. I have thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Standiford's John Deal series, and this departure showcases his depth as a writer.<br />There are enough twists and turns in this cat and mouse plot to keep your interest from start to finish. The characters are a bit larger than life, so there is a need to suspend your disbelief. It is ordinary people performing extraordinary feats.<br />There is a great deal of attention paid to details and for this reason I feel this book will provide even greater pleasure to those who hike or climb mountains.	2001-03-20

A friend tipped me off to WEB Griffin and I started off with his &quot;Men At War&quot; series, but out of order. This being the kickoff to the series, it came up as my second read.<br />Therefore, it was most interesting to get the complete back-story on the principle fictional characters. It certainly puts a more proper perspective on chapter two (&quot;Secret Warriorts&quot;).<br />I particularly enjoyed the mixing of actual events and real people from the WWII era with the fictional characters. It gives a greater feeling of reality and you feel part of the action.<br />The series revolves around the founding and early days of the OSS...and our quest to beat the Axis powers in the race to develop the Atomic Bomb. Here we experience the setup to covertly attain the uranium necessary to complete the task.<br />The primary fictional characters are remarkably portrayed in a way that would make Errol Flynn, John Wayne and Tyrone Power  proud. The action and plot flow smoothly and the book is great fun.<br />The characters are truly well developed and you feel an intimacy with many of them. You want them to show up in the next book in the series. Mr. Griffin does a good job of getting you to care about the players and to cheer for them all the way.<br />I am thankful to my friend for this recommendation and plan to read plenty more WEB Griffin.	2001-03-20
US	52009378	R2AGJNN8APTYVW	0446527289	188084707	The First Counsel	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Average at best.	Another fast read from Mr. Meltzer. Certainly fiction that requires a complete suspension of disbelief.<br />However, all this ground was covered in his most enjoyable &quot;The Tenth Justice&quot; with a far more interesting cast of characters and a more subtle plot. This is merely a variation on that theme, and not as well done as the original. Some of the characters are simply cartoonish in their incredulity.<br />I found nothing original here and was underwhelmed.	2001-03-20
US	52009378	R14B4W96PJ8B2G	0688163165	733601761	Mystic River	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Simply spectacular.	I do not know what I can add that has not already been said about the terrific work except: if you read only one book this year, make it &quot;Mystic River.&quot;<br />It is noir and hardboiled with a touch of darkness. I was seduced from page one.<br />It centers around three imperfect men in imperfect situations where each one tries to be less than imperfect in their individual approaches to a solution.<br />The journey from the setup in their youth to the resolution thirty years later is enthralling.<br />The story flows without pause. The characters, their environment and families are fully developed. The whodunit aspect is spectacular in its completeness and logic. Mr. Lehane keeps you changing your mind as you attempt to add up the clues to arrive at a solution.<br />I admit that I came late to the Dennis Lehane party only last year with &quot;Prayers for Rain&quot; and &quot;Sacred.&quot; He is a consistent writer, and the good news about my belated discovery is that I still have two Lehanes to read this year.<br />&quot;Mystic River&quot; would make a great movie. I see Ray Liotta, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon as the three principles.	2001-03-20

That is not to say that any in the series is weak. Quite the contrary...it is a powerful series.<br />It is realistic as the procedural part is most logical. It shows the grunt work necessary, the part luck plays and never to believe in coincidences in solving crimes.<br />The plot is always in motion and this action is the focus of the book. The personal life of the primary characters weaves thru the narrative, but never gets in the way of the flow of the whodunit.<br />Mr. McGarrity is high on my &quot;A&quot; list and I recommend this series highly. Start with &quot;Tularosa&quot; and I think you will be hooked.<br />This is one writer I would really like to meet at a reading and signing.	2001-03-19

A wonderfully written and richly textured novel. Very well plotted and it makes sense thru-out.<br />Some passages were so well written I found myself reading them three or four times just to appreciate their beauty.<br />It is at least semi-dark and not the fastest read, but well worth the time and effort. It needs to be savored.<br />The protagonists are well drawn and this should be a strong series. The supporting cast is most intriguing.	2001-03-19
US	52009378	R1WZVX4DW0PJE5	0446602612	243715630	The Poet	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Just as good the second time around.	It had been about five years since I first read &quot;The Poet.&quot; At that time I thought it was the finest mystery novel I had read. That judgement still stands. I was compelled to reread it after reading Mr. Connelly's &quot;A Darkness More Than Night,&quot; as protagonist Jack McEvoy appears in both novels.<br />My only regret is that I did not reread &quot;The Poet&quot; prior to reading &quot;ADMTN&quot;, as I had forgotten how the McEvoy character had changed and evolved as &quot;The Poet&quot; progressed, and was surprised to find him so cynical in &quot;ADMTN.&quot;<br />In any event, &quot;The Poet&quot; can stand stand on its own.<br />It was impossible to relax as the plot unfolded. Trying to deduce who's the villain, is quite an exercise and keeps you guessing and constantly changing your mind. Just as challenging is figuring out who among those who appearto be allies are truly foes. It is complex, but not Byzantine.<br />Pretty amazing that five years later I was just as hooked rereading it as I was on my initial read. Do not miss this one.	2001-03-19
US	52009378	R1CKQUVY8N97X7	0446606243	58879561	The Tenth Justice	Books	4	1	3	N	N	A fast and fun read.	If you completely suspend your disbelief before you read &quot;The Tenth Justice&quot; you'll have a most enjoyable read. Many of the situations are preposterous and are impossible to see happening. But those are merely elements in fiction...and this is truly fiction.<br />I understand the review that called this a great beach read. What a perfect description. The pages fly by as the protagonist and his associates get into one impossible situation after another. Trust starts to dissolve among the tight ban of friends as they try to trap the villain. This internal drama is just as dicey as the good versus bad battle, as the friends suspect there is a traitor amongst them.<br />Some interesting characters in the D.C. setting. This is nothing short of a fun read. If you go in treating this a &quot;lite read&quot; you'll have big fun, and it will not take much time.<br />Enjoy...	2001-02-19

It is extremely hard to put down even for sleep. Mr. Connelly is a master at keeping you turning the pages.<br />The melding of Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb is both a treat and a wonderful juxtaposition of characters. Can they become friends or will there be enough doubts raised to make them adversaries?<br />I strongly recommend going to [...] to get the short story that give you the back story and how Bosch and McCaleb first meet. It's very good insider knowledge.<br />It is not easy to to give a precis of ADMTN without divulging too much. The book does a spectacular job of developing the characters of Bosch and McCaleb.<br />My only regrets are that I read it so quickly and now I have another year to wait for the next one by Michael Connelly; and that I did not reread &quot;Bloodwork&quot; and &quot;The Poet&quot; (as reporter Jack McEvoy joins the cast of ADMTN) before starting &quot;A Darkness More Than Night.&quot;<br />As a solution I reread &quot;Bloodwork&quot; after ADMTN and will do the same with &quot;The Poet&quot; shortly. Then I plan to reread the entire Harry Bosch series in order (one a month) and that should take me to next MC release.<br />I have been fortunate enough to catch Mr. Connelly on three occasions at book signings. He is just as compelling speaking as he is in print. If he is making an appearance in your area, be certain to attend.	2001-02-19

Winning an Edgar gets my attention...especially when the competition includes Robert Crais' &quot;L.A. Requiem.&quot;<br />I can easily come up with another half dozen 1999 releases in the mystery/thriller genres that I read that did much more for me.<br />Michael Connelly's &quot;Void Moon&quot;, Lee Child's &quot;Tripwire&quot;, Vince Flynn's &quot;Transfer of Power&quot;, Michael McGarrity's &quot;Hermit's Peak&quot;, &quot;Hart's War&quot; by John Katzenbach  and Daniel Silva's &quot;The Marching Season&quot; all rate much higher on my enjoyment scale than &quot;Bones.&quot;<br />And, &quot;L.A. Requiem&quot; was certainly the most compelling read for me of the '99 issues I read.<br />Jan Burke is surely a fine writer. &quot;Bones&quot; is well crafted and carefully plotted. For my money, Stephen Hunter has given us far more loathsome killers, Michael Connelly more diabolical villains and Nelson DeMille characters more ruthless.<br />I liked and cared about Irene and her husband as well as some of the minor players such as Leonard (the security guard) and will read more of her body of work.<br />As &quot;Hocus&quot; shows up as Terry McCaleb's friend Buddy's book of choice in Michael Connelly's &quot;Bloodwork&quot; I will be reading that one shortly. Its subject matter is more in my ballpark.<br />It seems I am missing something that grabbed others in &quot;Bones&quot;, but I enjoyed the writing etc.; however the characters didn't do it for me. Just seems there were lots more impressive reads debuting in 1999.	2001-02-14

While I enjoyed &quot;Sacred&quot;, I thought that was due to the Florida locations.<br />But with &quot;Prayers For Rain&quot; I am converted and will now read his entire repertoire. It's Mr. Lehane's writing that's the winner, not just the Florida settings of &quot;Sacred.&quot;<br />The lead characters and their network are quite colorful and the action is first rate. It's truly a fast read and the resolution is satisfying.<br />The small backstory on Bubba was a big help for me in accepting and understanding this off center character.<br />This series could easily have screen possibilities with Ben Affleck my choice to play the lead.	2001-01-11

This chase takes place in California, Hong Kong and China. While in California I found it quite a good ride.<br />As soon as it left these shores and went to Hong Kong and China it grounded to nearly a halt for me. It got very heavy on travelogue and way too much on the poilitics of the region. These boring passages only accentuated the preposterous situations the protagonist got in and out of.<br />I did like Neal Carey and some of his support team. Mr. Winslow's writing style was fine and I will try another Neal Carey, but will make certain it takes place in the USA.<br />This could be an enjoyable series and lead character, but the setting for this book just bored me beyond words. If you care about China and its politics it's probably a big winner.	2001-01-11

A Michael Connelly endorsement led me to this one.<br />I simply either didn't get it or didn't like it...probably a combination of both.<br />I found it too dark, depressing, bleak, unfun and almost hopeless. I love the LA crime novels of Michael Connelly, Raymond Chandler and Robert Crais, but this was &quot;too out there&quot; for me.<br />Seeing all the five star reviews made me wonder if I was missing something. But, most of them are from California folks. So maybe it wasn't meant for me in the first place. Perhaps one needs to have the California experience to appreciate this. In any event this Florida reader didn't enjoy it.	2000-12-27
US	52009378	RALWW7HMDYB3P	0399144897	669901920	The White House Connection	Books	4	12	13	N	N	Fast read.	Jack Higgins is a terrific storyteller. This was my first Higgins novel and the pages flew by. Reading this book was like eating peanuts...I could not stop and finished in two sessions.<br />An absolute complete suspension of disbelief is the best way to approach this one as it stretches credulity to beyond the max...but it is great fun. And, what is fiction all about, if not for suspension of disbelief? Some of the situations the protagonists get out of would make James Bond proud.<br />In the setup, the first quarter of the book is pretty credible and then the fun begins. The action switches between Washington, New York, London and Ireland...lots of Concorde flights, tony parties and champaign between the gun shots. The good guys are interesting characters and the bad guys seem a match for them due to their mole inside the White House. The reader is clued into the mole's identity early on, so we know whodunit...so we have to watch the clock to see if the good guys can figure it out in time.<br />It was an enjoyable read all in all. The protagonists are continuing characters and it appears their ranks increased by one in &quot;The White House Connections.&quot; That's good news for Higgins' fans as he is a prolific writer.<br />That said, it was &quot;too Brit&quot; and &quot;too IRA&quot; for me to become addicted to the series. It was a fun one-time interlude for someone who prefers the good old American hardboiled mystery. For those who like the British touch, this series is a keeper.	2000-12-20

The pages just fly by. He sets scenes in the beautiful New Mexico landscape that place you there. His books have all lived up to the high standard set with his initial novel, &quot;Tularosa&quot;...no easy trick. His pacing really works...it was like eating peanuts...I had to read &quot;just one more&quot; passage before putting it down.<br />The characters are realistic, well defined and simply a great mix. The protagonist, Kevin Kerney, is unique in the cop/mystery genre in that he is pretty normal. He is not the prototypical flawed man who must ovcercome a myriad of personal demons. A limp resulting from a bullet to the kneecap is his only eccentricity. Kerney is a top cop, but also an excellent manager of people. His staff responds not only to his abilities, but also to the respect he shows all with whom he works. With all his field experience, he has seen it all and is hard to fool. He gets the job the right way and is easy to cheer for.<br />His romantic interest returns, but her sidebar does nothing to detract from the whodunit aspect. She is a strong character, a good addition and we will see more of her.<br />Mr. McGarrity has crafted a strong series with characters that stand out, all placed in a most atmospheric setting. I think he and the Kevin Kerney series are understated and underappreciated gems. He deserves more acclaim and recognition. He was suggested to me with these words: &quot;if you enjoy Michael Connelly, McGarrity is for you.&quot; I do and he is.<br />Do not miss this sereis.	2000-12-18

The book contains a pretty substantial number of important players. Usually with a cast of meaningful members this large it takes a while to know who's who, and where so and so fits in the group dynamic. But in &quot;The Ice Limit&quot; that's no problem. Almost immediately the roles were clearly defined and the action took off.<br />I thought the final sixty pages could have been done in twenty and that's all that kept me from giving five stars.<br />This was my initial Preston/Child read and I will read them all.

A fabulous plot that mixes a kid wrongly accused on the run, a police manhunt, a savvy contract killer on the loose, a politically motivated DA, a cop who beleives the kid (Nathan) just might be a victim and not a murderer.<br />Add a top rated DC talk show host to give the country the play by play and you have a book impossible to put down. I knocked it off in two sittings. It was nonstop action and I felt exhausted when all was resolved.<br />If I am not mistaken this is John Gilstrap's initial novel. I will be tracking down his later works.	2000-12-13

The players were most realistic and it was easy to get involved with all of them.<br />Cat and mouse kept me on edge of my seat. The twists and turns and red herrings made it impossible to put down.<br />The characters were well drawn and I will go back and read his earlier books. The ending was spectacular and what a surprise. The resolution leaves plenty of room for continuation of these characters and I look forward to a follow up.<br />This is a thriller drama at its best.	2000-12-11

Robert Crais has created a most interesting PI with many wonderful quirks and a great sense of right and wrong. Love the wisecracks and asides that are a big part of the Elvis Cole persona.<br />Colorful characters populate this one: a conterfeiter in the witness protection program, the Russian Mafia, Vietnamese revolutionaries, the Feds (some with dubious qualities) as Elvis and Pike attempt to reunite the counterfeiter with his three children.<br />No problem to follow, good pacing, a good surprise at the end, a satisfying conclusion and just plain hard to put down.<br />This is an extraordinary series with a certain noir quality that would translate well to film, especially if played like the &quot;Thin Man&quot; series.	2000-09-20

After reading it, I wish he had more novels for me to  discover.<br />It has a great pace, and fits somewhat into the cat and mouse  category. The search and chase for the info leads protagonist Adam Bruno  across the country, back in time and in contact with a wide array of  potential leads. It is easy to follow the logical pattern. The procedure is  clearly delineated and makes sense.<br />The characters were cleverly drawn  and it was no problem to cheer for Adam Bruno. He showed street smarts,  resourcefulness and imagination; tinged with just enough sarcasm directed  at his smug adversarial employer.<br />I did not find it excessively gory or  profane. People who have been thru what many of &quot;The Codicil&quot;'s  characters experienced do express themselves in this fashion. I found it  realistic and not overdone.<br />It is truly a page turner that took less than  a weekend to read. Great stuff!!!	2000-09-18

This is well written account of a boy's journey thru high school in the  rural South, in the early 1900's.<br />By all means it is a rich accounting,  peopled with some interesting characters and descriptive passages.<br />I much  prefer the mystery/action/thriller novels, so this moves rather slowly for  me. However, it's a nice change of pace.<br />Most realistic and contains  great insight into the people, time and place.	2000-09-18

Since this was my first Patricia Cornwell, I had neither any Kay Scarpetta  history nor expectations. So I rather enjoyed this one.<br />It has a sense of  the Carl Hiaasen/Laurence Shames humor and is an entertaining read. It has  a light hearted, ironic and quirky approach. There is also action and  movement.<br />Both the good and bad guys have comedic sides and all manage to  have their stumbles...the bad guys more so.<br />This novel is what it is, and  if not taken too seriously it is a fast, fun, quick read...it's  escapism.<br />And for those disappointed not to have a Kay Scarpetta, just  think how well refreshed her character will be with this interlude.	2000-09-18

Afer finishing the third Jack Reacher novel,  Lee Child has moved into my &quot;can't wait for the paperback/get the  hardcover upon release&quot; category. For me he joins: Michael Connelly,  Stephen Hunter, Nelson DeMille, James W. Hall, Stuart Woods, William Diehl,  Clive Cussler and Robert Crais.<br />&quot;Tripwire&quot; contains all the  best aspects of thriller, suspense and the cat and mouse. Reacher is a  strong presence as the resourceful protagonist. Part of his past is  presented in the back story as he follows up on a case initially undertaken  by his recently deceased mentor. A love interest enters his life in the  person of his mentor's daughter. Reacher's current life is getting more  complete and he is growing as a character.<br />The chase for information to  solve the mystery of a Vietnam chopper crash is well thought out and  proceeds at a good pace.<br />The villains are perfectly loathsome, but clever  and daring...they are worthy adversaries. Reacher uses his MP background,  military contacts and knowledge of how the army works to get the answers as  he searches for the villains.<br />Great surprise twist at the end that I did  not predict. A page turner of the first order.	2000-09-09

Is there another writer whose word pictures are more picturesque than  those of James Lee Burke?<br />The Robicheaux series keeps improving. This one  fills in the back story on the detective's mother's death (murder).<br />Her  death intersects with current crimes and leads Robicheaux down a twisting  path filled with wonderfully colorful chaacters (both good and bad.)<br />Much  is not as it first appears. The fine line between hero and villain is often  murky as some of the rogues seem to possess some redeeming qualities.  Naturally each of the &quot;white hats&quot; is flawed, having their own  demons to overcome. It's a magnificent cross section of humanity and great  slice of life.<br />The various subplots dovetail nicely into a roaring  finale. The story proceeds at an excellent even pace, never  forced.<br />&quot;Purple Cane Road&quot; is a well told tale that keeps you  turning pages and guessing up to the final page.	2000-09-09

It  is in the suspense/thriller/cat and mouse category, rather than the more  supernatural, atmospheric novels he is known for.<br />It reads well, the  pages fly by, the pace is always building and the flow logical. It is a  book with strong momentum. You won't get bored.<br />Strong characters, good  action and a satisfying resolution.<br />It gives one a glimpse at DK at an  early stage, and is worth reading for that alone. More importantly, it  works. I feel he does this genre quite well and wish he would give us a  couple more like this and &quot;Dark Rivers of the Heart.&quot;<br />&quot;The  Watchers&quot; is still my favorite DK.	2000-09-08

I guess I really prefer his novels set in the old West and  other action fare.<br />Most of the characters just wore me out. Sort of  wanted to slap them. Pretty silly in spots. And, how can a bunch of adults  be bossed around by a five year of kid. The dog jumping off the Statue of  Liberty and living was another aspect that was hard to accept. Thinking  back, it's hard to come up with a character I could really care about.<br />On  the plus side, it was a fast read and the usual interesting McMurtry dialog  was always present.<br />Mr. McMurtry has given me so much reading pleasure  in the past that I will still await his future offerings. No one bats  1.000, so he's entitled to a miss.	2000-08-30

This is a series  to look forward to.<br />It is a complex plot, fully resolved containing the  atmospheric writing that JLB does as well as any writer. You are  transported to Deaf Smith and are made to feel a part of the area.<br />It is  peopled with flawed characters, both good and bad. No one is perfect, and  you are certain you've known or observed most of them. The players are a  rogue's gallery, many of whom are lovable...some forgivable, others  unrepentant and unsympathetic. A few have redeeming characteristics beneath  a questionable exterior. It's a remarkable cast.<br />It is always a treat to  read JLB. He never fails to entertain and brings great emotion to his  words. It's quite delightful that he is giving readers two series to savor.  Don't miss &quot;Heartwood.&quot;	2000-08-27

I found it to be a nice treat.<br />It was an interestinglook at the workings of the repoman and an enlightning look at the gypsy lifestyle.<br />The members of the DKA agency were wonderfully drawn characters...very Runyon-esque. The gypsy characters could not have been more colorful. The plots and sidebars were neatly tied together.<br />There is a lot of humor mixed in with the crime, trackdowns, deceptions, double dealings and repo procedural. This would make a great movie. The action never stops and Mr.  Gores does a great job of putting the reader inside the mind of the players.<br />&quot;32 Cadillacs&quot; was very entertaining and my initial Joe Gores book. I feel like I have discovered a new writer and look forward to more fun reads by Joe Gores.	2000-08-27

Having been disappointed in &quot;North of Havana&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Invented Florida&quot; I started &quot;Captiva&quot; apprehensively. It  did not take long to find the Doc Ford adventure I had missed.<br />Peopled  with great quirky, colorful characters; both good and evil...a clear plot  and a couple of red herrings, this one moved at a nice pace. The last one  hundred pages truly went at warp speed.<br />For me, this is Randy Wayne White  at his best. As usual, Florida is a major character, as it should be. The  feel for Florida is unmistakingly powerful and Doc Ford is just a great  protagonist. The culture and community of those who live aboard boats is  well documented. There are so many realistic touches, that it becomes easy  to give credibility to the entire storyline.<br />Pure enjoyment, satisfying  resolution, interesting subplots, beautiful word pictures...a Doc Ford  novel not to be missed.	2000-08-26

As a  James Patterson fan I went in ready to be bowled over. While not my  favorite from Mr. Patterson, this is a satisfying read. Certainly  worthwhile just to get the history of his writings.<br />Like everything I  have read from Mr. Patterson, this one read extremely fast. It took me a  little while to put faces on the main characters, and I am not certain that  I was 100% successful in that task. I got to know them pretty well, and  found the plot set up most engaging...it kept me on my toes.<br />Somehow  &quot;The Thomas Berryman Number&quot; had a feel somewhat like &quot;The  Anderson Tapes&quot;---at least to me. It certainly had me turning  pages.<br />I have to recommend reading this one if you are a James Patterson  fan. It takes little time due to his flowing writing style, and give you a  sense of where he started. Surely I plan to get a hold of more of his  earlier works. Mr. Patterson gets your attention and moves the story at a  good pace.	2000-08-26

Suspend your disbelief, open the book and take another great ride by Clive  Cussler. Mr. Cussler is a master at tying together a myriad of subplots and  weaving them into one great plot and resolution.<br />This new NUMA pair is  exciting and just as compelling as Dirk and Al. The situations are just  close enough to the edge that you can imagine that, &quot;yes, maybe this  really could happen.&quot;<br />Expect a fast pace, clearly defined  characters, contemptible villains and a satisfying ending. The multiple  locations, NUMA resources and manpower are all here. It's a treat to have  appearances from Admiral Sandecker, Rudy Gunn and Hiram Yeager.<br />I look  forward to additional adventures from Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala. This is  another series winner for Clive Cussler.<br />Great fun.	2000-08-26

However, my disappointment matches that of the other reviewers.<br />I had to  assign myself fifty pages a day to complete this one. In a word it was a  task.  Confusing, way too dark, no sympathetic characters, boring and  tedious.<br />Mr. Patterson is capable of much better, so I kept reading  hoping for the enjoyment to begin...it never happened for me. I was just  relieved to finish.<br />Someone once told me that &quot;life is too short for  a bad book.&quot; I think he had this book in mind.	2000-08-06

While not as complicated, noir or hardboiled as the 87th Precinct novels, they are great fun and  witty.<br />This one was almost a short story. Good workable plot, a couple  interesting sidebars, enjoyable characters and a resolution you can  accept.<br />The Florida scene is well set in the fictitious city of Calussa  with a couple of Miami excursions. Mathew Hope is an interesting  protagonist...a lawyer with a heart of gold willing to be a private eye for  his client as well.<br />It's fast, easy and entertaining.	2000-08-02

While Lawrence Sanders was writing, the McNally books were always meant to be light hearted capers. A few laughs, a lot of grins, wry dialog and a host of quirky characters (rich and infamous). We still have the basics and  it's always a treat to follow Archy's romps thru the Palm Beaches.<br />At  times Mr. Lardo seems to be trying too hard, but overall it is a fun read.  I never seem to get enough of Al Rogoff and that didn't change.<br />The  characters were a wonderful rogues gallary, the loose ends neatly tied up  and whodunit and how it was done were nifty surprises.<br />I appreciate Mr.  Lardo keeping Archy and the gang alive and will seek out his &quot;Hampton  Affair&quot; novel.	2000-07-30

Give the author a lot of latitude in credulity department and enjoy. The two villainesses are almost cartoonish and stretch the imagination.<br />This  was my first &quot;Prey&quot; series read and I will take the advice of an  earlier reviewer and read the initial entry. I liked Lucas Davenport and  would like to fill in the blanks on him.<br />The first hundred pages flew by  and then it sputtered and sped up a couple of times. There was some great  cop dialog and some interesting characters on Davenport's side of the law.  Interesting twist on the cat and mouse genre.<br />It's fun, but not too  likely.	2000-07-26

A notch below his &quot;Term Limits&quot;, but strongly entertaining nonetheless.<br />The characters are deeply drawn and the  villains particularly detestable. A couple of the good guys appeared in  &quot;Term Limits&quot; and lend a continuity and certain air of  credibility to the book. I hope Mr. Flynn keeps them and continues their  development.<br />There's a bit of humor amid the captivating, fast paced  writing. I think Mr. Flynn tells a good tale, and with a minimum suspension  of disbelief it is easy to get involved and not put his books down. I have  added Vince Flynn to my list of must read writers.	2000-07-23

There was some clever writing and witty dialog in the fist quarter of the book. Then it bogged down. Too many characters, too many flashbacks, too many  subplots...just confusion. I did manage to read the entire book and it got  slower as it came to a conclusion...just the opposite of what I look for in  a thriller.	2000-07-23

I have read CH from the beginning and this one falls far short of his  wonderfully funny previous novels. It seems this vein has been mined too  many times. It's the same type of characters in slightly different  sourroundings. This time they appear tired, trite and ready for a change. I  recall only two out loud laughs, whereas his prior books never failed to  elicit many many hearty laughs.<br />Carl Hiaasen is capable of so much more.  It is time for a change of pace and a fresh approach from one of the finest  writers Florida has produced. Being based in Miami he certainly has no  shortage of material upon which to draw.	2000-07-09

Having read James Hall from the beginning I rank &quot;Rough Draft&quot; as his finest yet. Those other reviewers, for whom this is their first James Hall, have a lot of treats waiting for them.<br />&quot;Rough  Draft&quot; is a complex thriller, taking the cat and mouse game to new  heights. Mr Hall's easy to read flowing writing style allows the reader to  keep up with the twists, turns and red herrings without confusion.<br />The  chacters are deeply drawn and we get good insight into their professional  and personal sides.<br />Full of drama, suspense and tension this tale almost  turns the pages for you. It took me a bit of willing suspension of  disbelief concerning the villain's homicide method (but that's why they  call it fiction). The conclusion was satisfying and whodunit a worthy  surprise.<br />I feel Mr. Hall could have another successful series if Frank  and Hannah started their own PI firm.<br />Count me among those puzzled by Mr.  Hall's lack of recognition. He writes the Florida crime/mystery novel as  well as anyone, and better than most.	2000-07-06
US	52009378	R2J9AXEOLERORP	037550253X	204619529	The Naked Detective	Books	3	0	2	N	N	A very different Laurence Shames. A 3 and 1/2.	I am a big fan of Laurence Shames and his Key West capers with many a colorful character. The high dose of humor his stories usually contain is a huge selling point. Like Woody Allen, I enjoy Laurence Shames when he's  funny.<br />There is scant humor in &quot;The Naked Detective&quot;, so it  ranks low on my personal likeability meter. However, it is a strong noirish  short novel. As usual the Key West descriptions are so vivid you can taste  the salty air, get burned by the sun and feel the dampness of the humidity.  The scenes are brilliantly set. The action is a bit uneven; nonstop at  times, followed by lulls.<br />The whodunit is a clever twist and the  &quot;Maltese Falcon like&quot; buried treasure's identity is kept from the  reader until the end. Neither is easily telegraphed, so you have plenty of  time to play guessing games and solve the mystery.	2000-07-04

This is the latest in the Swagger saga and could be considered the prequel. &quot;Hot Springs&quot; presents the back story of Earl Swagger (Bob Lee a.k.a.  &quot;Bob the Nailer's&quot; father.)<br />Earl returns from the Pacific  campaign a Medal of Honor winner...a true hero. He is tapped to ramrod a  strike force whose agenda is to put an end to the illicit activities so  pervasive in Hot Springs, mostly controlled by Owney Maddox. The head of  the strike force has grand polical ambitions, so Earl's enemies and allies  both work against him.<br />Mr. Hunter brings the likes of Harry Truman, Bugsy  Siegel, Virginia Hill, Mickey Rooney and Alan Ladd in for cameo appearances  and sets the 1946 scene to perfection in many subtle ways.<br />The book moves  at warp speed. You are compelled to turn pages in an attempt to keep up  with the action.The story is presented from the minds of four or five main  characters in alternating chapters so when you want to learn the outcome of  one situation you must enjoy three or four more chapters to get that  particular resolution. Like eating peanuts, you cannot read just one  chapter.<br />Mr. Hunter delivers a nonstop action read laced with taut  suspense and peopled with rich, well defined characters. No one (heroes  especially) is perfect and this novel is hard boiled noir at its very best.	2000-06-30

This is really more of a short story full of action in the period of the Alamo. One can see the genesis of the future Burke works. Wonderfully descriptive phrases, fully  drawn characters and the ever present feeling of danger. As a James Lee  Burke fan I am glad it has been reissued...it's well worth taking the time  to explore his origins...and it's got lots of action and thrills.	2000-06-26

This is a most intriguing &quot;stand alone&quot; from man who has given us the wonderful PI, Elvis Cole. This break in the Elvis Cole action  is certain to bring us a refreshed Elvis.<br />Meanwhile &quot;Demolition  Angel&quot; grabbed me from page one and did not let go. It was difficult  to work up a liking for the protagonist (Carol Starky) at first, but she  seemed to become less abrasive (without losing her edginess) as the book  moved along. By the end I was cheering her every inch of the  way.<br />Surrounded by her own demons, a rogue ATF agent, a skeptical boss, a  cop gone bad, a serial bomber and assorted other allies and enemies, Mr.  Crais has given the reader a wonderful supporting cast.<br />Intricate plot  twists, a believable chain of events and a satisfying resolution all  combine to make a most enjoyable read.	2000-06-25

Jance is a gifted story teller and I have become quite the Joanna Brady fan. &quot;Outlaw Mountain&quot; spends a bunch of time on Joanna's personal life, but has enough plot and subplots going on that the action  outdistances the soap opera. Joanna and her immediate circle continue to  grow as characters and are easy to care about.

I have become a John Leslie fan via his Key West PI Gideon Lowry series. I stumbled upon &quot;Bounty Hunter Blues&quot; in a used book store and glad I picked it up. Written in 1990 it is now out of print, but a most  worthwhile read. A nifty collection of characters, some of whom are most  Runyonesque. A twisty plot where the bad guys get their due. The good guys  get their rewards, some rather unique. The plot is resolved in a believable  way.<br />Really glad I found this one.

This was a disappointment and not at all what I expected from a book that won an Edgar. If the soap opera dialog and interaction between the protagonist (Grace Rossi) and her daughter, mother, father, exhusband, best  friend were eliminated there would be a wonderfully compact legal  whodoneit. The characters involved in the legal action are believable, the  plot interesting and is nicely resolved. This is not the only award winner  for Lisa Scottoline, so I am tempted to try another, hoping for less soap  and more thrills.	2000-06-11

I never felt like I got to know any of the characters, and thought there were too many of them. The whodoneit was never clearly defined for me. I could not assuredly decide what crime was  being solved. It just failed to explode for me. Since it won both an  Anthony and Shamus award in 1997 I will give his &quot;Widower's Two  Step&quot; a shot later this summer. It got nominated for an Anthony and  Shamus and won an Edgar. The setting of the scenes and the Texas atmosphere  were well done, but the dialog and characters escaped me. I would rather  read James Lee Burke or Robert Crais.	2000-06-04
US	52009378	R1B8YKVCCOXUV2	0671023179	590280047	Term Limits	Books	4	0	2	N	N	Tension packed thriller.	A bunch of people whose tastes I trust have highly recommended Vince Flynn's &quot;Transfer of Power&quot;, so I decide to start with his first novel and I was not disappointed.<br />This one moves full speed ahead from  page one. The technical aspects seem correct and the DC/Maryland landscape  is well mapped and researched. So, the activity flows nicely and you can  believe the action.<br />The premise to the plot is where the imagination is  needed; but if you have even the tiniest belief in any conspiracy theory  involving the U.S. government, then it is easy to buy into the basis of Mr.  Flynn's ideas.<br />A couple of FBI and CIA types are bona fide decent, but  the rest of the &quot;good guys&quot; have decided the ends justify the  means, and have taken the means to their own extremes. The villains are far  worse, and totally repulsive.<br />If I had one complaint I would say it's  about one hundred pages too long. It was overkill on the final three or  four &quot;situations&quot; after the evil doers were uncovered. From what  I have heard and the reviews I have seen in Amazon.com, it is apparent Mr.  Flynn left a lot for his second novel. I look forward to &quot;Transfer of  Power&quot; and hope it's a little more compact.	2000-05-31
US	52009378	RDVNX2TTQMQYL	0060191872	995699181	The Run	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Stuart Woods holds your attention from start to finish.	Stuart Woods is such a good story teller that he can even make a Goldwater Republican like me cheer for the very liberal Democrat Will Lee as he runs for President.<br />This is the third book featuring Will Lee, so his  character is fully developed, and those surrounding him (family, friends  and professional associates) are equally well defined. Of the three books I  liked &quot;Grassroots&quot; the best.<br />In &quot;The Run&quot;, those  trying to prevent Will Lee from being elected come from within his own  party, the Republicans and an ultra right wing paramilitary organization  attempting to assassinate him. An unlikely ally resides in a maximum  security prison for treason-like activities.<br />Mr. Woods' novels all move  at a speedy pace and &quot;The Run&quot; is no exception. Some suspension  of disbelief is necessary, but that does nothing to detract from the book's  enjoyment. I guess that's why they call it fiction.<br />Will Lee is that rare  politico with no skeletons that can lead to his downfall. But, you do get  to experience the backroom deals, the ugly back stabbing of Washington  politics and the D.C. intrigue.<br />&quot;The Run&quot; is a fun, quick and  timely weekend read that is sure to keep you turning pages, caring for the  characters and cheering for Will Lee.	2000-05-28

There are books that take time to read, books you make time for and books you steal time for. &quot;Spencerville&quot; is in the latter category...it never left my side from the minute I started it and kept me up  late.<br />Great characters, very deeply drawn...both the heroes and villains.  I felt I got to know them all. The plot is straight forward, but the  journey to its conclusion is fast paced, tense, filled with twists and  turns and makes you turn the pages rapidly.<br />There is enough wry humor,  sarcasm and cynicism from the protagonist (Keith Landry) and his allies to  allow the reader a chance to relax from the nonstop action...refreshing and  almost necessary in a book this lengthy.<br />The major bad guy (Cliff Baxter)  is truly despicable, but devious, dangerous, deadly and cunning (and he  wears a badge). It is quite easy hoping he gets what's due him.<br />I have  now read all the novels of Nelson DeMille. Only &quot;Cathedral&quot; was a  disappointment. Every other one I highly recommend and still think  &quot;The Charm School&quot; is my favorite.	2000-05-26
US	52009378	RV2OX7NHR58II	0688166385	352393955	Killshot	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Pretty good fun.	A cast of quirky characters as befits the Elmore Leonard tradition. Sort of &quot;crooks do the dumbest things.&quot; Some of the so called good guys aren't too bright either.<br />With one crook whose goal is to rob a bank  in every state, a girl friend who is certain Elvis is still alive and a  partner who feared his grandmother could turn him into an owl, the stage is  set for some laughs amongst the criminal hi-jinks.<br />The snappy Elmore  Leonard dialog is here with a well paced plot. The action has a nice  sensible flow.<br />While I prefer it when Mr. Leonard sets his novels in  Florida, &quot;Killshot&quot; a most pleasant escapist read. Nothing  deep...just good fun and reading enjoyment. It's in the Carl Hiaasen a/o  Laurence Shames vein.	2000-05-23

He does not have the high profile of the likes of Carl Hiaasen, James Hall, Edna Buchanan, Dave Barry, Elmore Leonard, Randy Wayne White,  etc., but he captures the essence of Florida in wonderfully spare  novels.<br />Consider this word picture of the Central Florida heat: &quot;On  his left, the ocean rolled blue-green and too sluggish for whitecaps, as if  it felt the burden of the heat and was lulled to lethergy.&quot; Anyone who  spent time in Central Florida between May and October has experienced that  feeling.<br />&quot;Kiss&quot; is a Fred Carver, PI entry. Carver, retired due  to disability from the Orlando PD (shot in kneecap and needs a cane), now  resides along the mid Florida East Coast. While his supporting cast is  excellent, he prefers to work alone and maintain self reliance.<br />The plot  is believable, the crime feasable, the crooks a fine mixture of brains,  brawn and corrupted innocents. Throw in a couple of red herrings, dogged  detective work, menace from a psycho, all under the hot Florida sun and you  are rewarded with an enjoyable read.	2000-05-20

I have become a fan of John Leslie as well as his Gideon Lowry series.<br />Set in Key West it is peopled with the quirky types found in the southern most piece of land in the USA. The native Key Westers (conchs)  have a strong sense of place and are protective of their own and the  town.<br />What appears to be suicide doesn't seem so to PI Gideon Lowry and  off he goes to find the real answer. Along the way robbery, double dealing,  smoke screens and red herrings turn up. The confusion mounts to the point  where Gideon even wonders if his distant cousin (Judge Just Watson) is  involved.<br />Many a twist and turn sprinkled amongst the picturesque Key  West sunsets, ocean breezes and humid air. It's a fun read.<br />I guess John  Leslie and Laurence Shames are my favorite Key West mystery writers and  &quot;Love For Sale&quot; was a fast read. The characters are clearly  defined, the pace is quick without be frantic and all in all the action is  believable.<br />With Gideon's cousin getting married and sort of adopting his  bride's twentysomething child it appears a couple of new continuing  characters have been added and I look forward to their further adventures.	2000-05-18

All the feedback put me in the vast minority.<br />Now after reading &quot;Sacred&quot; in one day I understand why Mr.  Lehane is getting raves.<br />This is a momentum book...a bit slow developing,  but about a third of the way thru it picks up speed and goes nonstop to the  ending. The conclusion does require a major suspension of disbelief, but  that does not diminish the chase. For me, the payoff was the chase rather  than the finale.<br />The red herrings and misdirections kept me guessing and  turning the pages. The building action was such that Mr. Lehane left me  hanging at the end of a chapter, forcing me to read &quot;just one more  chapter&quot;...and then one more etc. Just three sittings to complete  &quot;Sacred.&quot;<br />As a Floridian I particularly enjoyed the scenes in  the Tampa Bay area. That made me wonder if the Florida setting made the  difference in my enjoyment of Mr. Lehane. I will sample another of his  works shortly to see if it is the author or simply the book that won me  over. I hope it's the former as it would be wonderful to have another  writer whose books are impossible to put down.	2000-05-17

A most enjoyable ride thru the old west told in nine short stories.<br />Mr. L'Amour puts you right in the scene. You can almost feel the heat of the desert sun, taste the blowing alkali dust, see the Indians on the horizon  and touch the hand tooled leather saddles.<br />He places you right in the  middle of the action and the word paintings of the Southwest are  magnificent. He brings the sunsets to life and allows the reader to  visualize the stark beauty of the Arizona/New Mexico deserts.<br />The  characters, both good and bad guys, are well sculpted and realistic. They  epitomize the hard life that country bred and are easy to admire.<br />Along  with Larry McMurtry, Louis L'Amour makes the western a gourmet read.	2000-05-15

Superbly crafted with many fully developed characters (good and bad) filled with tense drama and unending suspense...and an ending with a satisfying resolution as not every good guy remains standing.<br />Some  suspension of disbelief may be necessary, but not a ton.<br />In times of  extreme duress against impossible odds (especially in battle) many times  men have risen to incredible heights. It is this aspect of the human spirit  that is central to &quot;By The Rivers Of Babylon&quot; and makes it so  credible. It is the story peopled with unlikely heroes who surprise even  themselves as they rise to the occasion.<br />I was drawn to the protagonists  and their indomital vitality under pressure. It was refreshing that all  were flawed, but none beyond redemption.<br />The villians were exceedingly  well drawn and particularly abhorrent.<br />A most exciting and fulfilling  reading experience.<br />EOM	2000-05-14

James Patterson creates stories that make pages turn at a rapid pace.<br />I thought the first half packed more punch as Alex Cross finally gets closure on the Gary Soneji case. Very intense and absolutely riveting.<br />The second  part where the hunt for &quot;Mr. Smith&quot; transpires up and down the  East Coast is more oriented to the psychological aspects and gripping in  its own right.<br />I thought Gary Soneji to be a more loathsome villain than  Mr. Smith. The other members of the police, FBI and Interpol that Alex  Cross and his partner Sampson work with are believable and easy to cheer  for.<br />Putting the clues together that Mr. Smith has left after his crimes  is great intellectual drama.<br />The murders Mr. Smith commits are very  gruesome. Their descriptions are very graphic and maybe a little over the  top. Some suspension of disbelief is necessary.<br />Overall a fine read.  Another strong outing from Mr. Patterson.<br />KVD	2000-05-08

There was no putting it down. It was a riveting, nonstop read from page one.<br />John Corey is a wonderful protagonist, and Mr. DeMille allows him a lot of humor and  political incorrectness as well as his hard nosed dedication to getting the  job done right. John Corey's inner thoughts (those he does not say aloud)  brought many a laugh as Mr. Corey tried to behave in the most polically  correct way in the interest of inter-agency cooperation.<br />The culture  clash between the FBI and CIA ops and John Corey are well played. At times  one wonders if the agency types are not interfering with the real  mission...but John Corey prevails.<br />Mr. DeMille is one of my favorite  writers. &quot;The Lion's Game&quot; joins &quot;The Charm School&quot;,  &quot;Word of Honer&quot; and &quot;The Gold Coast&quot; as my favorites.  Only &quot;Cathedral&quot; disappointed me.<br />Tightly packed and tension  filled with a wonderful dash of wry humor fill this speedy page  turner.<br />KVD	2000-05-06

After thoroughly enjoying &quot;The Choirboys&quot; I plodded thru this one.<br />There is no doubt it is extremely well written with some strong characters.<br />As I am fan of the fiction mystery novel, perhaps it was the  more true crime aspect of the book that caused me to lose  interest.<br />Certainly I will read more of Mr. Wambaugh's books, but I will  be careful to assure myself it leans to the fiction side.

Having plodded thru the past couple of Mr. Grisham's novel, it was jusst wonderful to once again get a page turner that took less two days to read. No way could I put this one down<br />It is hard to find what one would call  the definitive all American good guy protagonist. It's a nice change of  pace to cheer for the &quot;good guys&quot; who are in reality flawed  neer-do-wells.<br />While not quite noir characters, they have an occasional  burst of a Damon Runyanesquelike charm. You cannot totally despise them as  they attempt to beat the system.<br />I found a high entertainment value  throughout the book. It may have been short on the courtroom drama, but it  was full of the type of action that grabbed me in &quot;The  Client.&quot;<br />This one was a treat.<br />KVD	2000-05-06

As a major fan of Michael Connelly, Robert Crais and Raymond Chandler and the LA they picture, I know I should enjoy James Ellroy. However, he just doesn't do it for me.<br />I have now read three of his novels and doubt I  will try any more.<br />&quot;The Big Nowhere&quot; was too long, tedious and  confusing for my tastes.<br />A couple of the main characters were quite  interesting and I looked forward to following their escapades. But overall  the novel just was too &quot;over the top&quot; for me.<br />While I finish  the books of Messrs. Connelly, Crais and Chandler in a couple of days, Mr.  Ellroy's take me over a week. I do not try to steal time for him as I do  those other wonderful writers of crime mysteries set in LA.<br />KVD	2000-05-06

Consider the FIVR STAR rating for both of Mr. Liddy's techno thriller novels...this one and &quot;Out of Control.&quot;<br />While they 1990 and 1980 copywrites they give the same high degree of thrills today. Both are  tension filled, taunt plots.<br />Certainly Mr. Liddy is well qualified to  write of &quot;special ops&quot; and he pulls no punches. I could not put  down either book. And, with his creditials suspension of disbelief is at at  minimum.<br />My hope is that he will do more and if he writes one every ten  years, could 2000 be the date for another action packed page  turner?<br />Great stuff!

I cannot count the number of times I have given this book as a  gift to introduce friends to Miacael Connelly. It never fails to hook them  and make them Michael Connelly fans as well. In my opinion Mr. Connelly is  the finest in the genre currently writing. The Poet was impossible to put  down. In fact I was sorely tempted to cheat and read some of the ending  chapters early in the read. Resisted the temptation, but few books have  enticed that behavior in me.	2000-05-05

I can understand why all the awards and nominations on this first novel. Elvis Cole and Joe Pike are wonderful LA characters. Mr. Crais paints vivid word pictures of LA and gets the reader involved with the players. Lots of action and loathsome bad guys. Having read three others in the Elvis Cole  series I was familiar with the backgrounds of Cole and Pike...and I feel  that kept me better prepared for some of the twists. Michael Connelly  remains the premier mystery novelist to me, but Robert Crais is certainly  adding quality to the genre. Looking forward to more of this most enjoyable  series.	2000-04-24

I do not think that Stuart Woods has ever disappointed me. &quot;Grassroots&quot; is intricately plotted with absorbing parallel stories that work their way to the same bad guys. Mr. Woods writes in a way  that makes the pages fly by. It's easy to pull for the good guys and it is  impossible to work up any sympathy for the villains. The protagonist  (Senatorial candidate Will Lee) is scheduled to reappear in Mr. Woods' next  novel (&quot;The Run&quot;). After reading &quot;Grassroots&quot; I shall  be first in line when &quot;The Run&quot; hits the stores sometime in May.  Mr. Woods has a most entertaining series currently going with bon vivant  lawyer Stone Barrington that I find to be great fun.	2000-04-22

I now understand the &quot;soap opera&quot; references in the review section. It was almost like something Harold Robbins or Howard Fast would have written. If that's  what I was looking for, I would chosen one of their books. Were it not for  my faith in Mr. Patterson and the easy and speedy readability of the book I  would have quit it at any number of places. I will look forward to his  other books and hope this is just an anomaly.

I enjoyed &quot;Fast Forward&quot; more. This one was too heavy in the romance department for my taste. Would have prefered more suspense.  Ariel finds trouble coming at her head on and obliquely as she works  towards solving a two year old murder. Ms. Mercer makes it easy to like the  good guys in Ariel's circle, and I hope to hear more from her grandfather  (B.F.) and his pal Sarge.

After reading the book I can understand the disparity in the customer  reviews. &quot;State of Mind&quot; was a disappointment to me as I found  Mr. Katzenbach's &quot;Hart's War&quot; &amp; &quot;Shadowman&quot; among  the best books I have ever read. Parts of &quot;State of Mind&quot; just  flew by and I became quite engrossed...then periods of dull nonaction.  Perhaps it was just too long. Were it not for my faith in Mr. Katzenbach's  writing there were many times I would have quit this one. Kept figuring it  would pick up in the next chapter. Ending is a pretty good payoff, but  takes too long to get there and it's a plodding journey. Set in a Blade  Runner world the overall plot made sense and the characters were well  drawn. Mr. Katzenbach has entertained me before and will again.	2000-04-13

I am also a major fan of the great collection of Florida mystery writers. This book misses for me for the same reasons other  Sunshine State writers have. When they get into the Cuban exile politics my  interest wanders. If I want political intrigue, I'll read a political  intrigue novel. But, when I pick up a mystery novel by a familiar writer I  have no patience for the exile story. Miami has more than enough murder,  mystery and crime to draw upon (log on the Miami Herald)and keep readers  turning pages without politicizing the Cuban migration. On the plus side,  Ms.Parker draws wonderfully clear characters and paints outstanding word  pictures of Dade County. When she keeps it to the courtroom procedure and  amateur sleuthing I find her books far more compelling.	2000-04-05

Jack Reacher is a good protagonist, and no less believable than Dirk Pitt, James Bond, etc. Any action adventure takes some willing suspension of disbelief as well the ability to accept coincidences. That said, I have  become a Reacher fan. As in &quot;Killing Floor&quot; he gets in the wrong  place at the wrong time and is considered a bad guy by other good guys.  Using whatever resources are at hand he presses on and keeps you on the  edge of your seat. I did think &quot;Killing Floor&quot; a stronger read,  but look forward to this series continuing.	2000-03-31

Jance and this is another good one in the Sheriff Joanna Brady series. J.A. Jance's writing is clear and concise and the characters well drawn. The Arizona settings are wonderfully  pictured and provide a great backdrop. The characters seem real and the  pages fly by.

It did not take long to get hooked with this different take on &quot;reluctant hero overcomes  impossible perils&quot;. The pages flew by at at least 100 per sitting. Mr  DeMille is a master at keeping you glued to his books and  &quot;Mayday&quot; is great entertainment. It takes a minimum willing  suspension of disbelief to get totally involved and root for the good guys.  The bad guys are well drawn and it is easy to find them dispicable. Fun  read.	2000-03-22

He shared a panel with Michael Connelly entitled &quot;Beyond Crime and Punishment.&quot; I started  &quot;Midnight Club&quot; after the panel and finished it the next day.

As an Edna Buchanan and Britt Montero fan I was filled with immense disappointment after reading this one. &quot;Garden of Evil&quot; required more suspension of disbelief than I am capable of. And, Britt's  photographer friend at &quot;The News&quot; has become one very annoying  character. James Lee Burke and Clive Cussler have proven that a continuing  character can get stale and become a parody of itself. It may be time for  Edna Buchanan to give Britt a rest and during the pause give us a new  protagonist. Then Britt can return refreshed, much like James Robicheaux  and Dirk Pitt have after interludes by their authors. Michale Connelly has  broken up his Harry Bosch series three times, and that certainly looks like  the right way to keep a character vibrant. Edna Buchanan has given us much  much better about Miami (and Britt) and is capable of so much more. This is  not up to the usual high Buchanan standard.	2000-02-19

Plot offered great entertainment and allowed one to indulge in a well crafted conspiracy theory. Saw a review that compared Reacher to Stephen Hunter's Bob Lee  Swagger. I cannot go that far, but I may upgrade Reacher when I read the  rest of the series. I did not find the violence offputting, after a number  of the reader reviews spoke negatively of those scenes. To me they were  pretty much brief passages except for the Sam Peckinpahlike slow motion  sequence of the final fight. While many bad guys were eliminated, their  demises were pretty much, &quot;I was here, they were there, they had these  weapons, I had these weapons, I had to accomplish this in this  manner.&quot; Then he does it. The characters, the howdoneit and the  intrigue occupy the great majority of the book...and they are first rate. I  look forward to more Jack Reacher.	2000-02-19

I am not sure if this is the best book I have read this year, but I suspect it is. What I certain of, is that it is easily the most powerful book I have read thus far in 1999.  Wonderfully deep characters, twists and turns that offer constant  surprises, clear writing. After you live the lives of the main characters,  the final chapter is especially moving. John Katzenbach is a marvelous  writer. I know two of his novels have been made into movies. It would be  great to see &quot;Hart's War&quot; make it to film.	1999-10-04
US	52009378	R1XB7K63NW131L	0671019392	912880608	9 Scorpions	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Above average, below the Lassiter series	Found initial 2/3 a bit slow and at times a little tedious. When the setting shifted to Florida the action picked up and pages started turning. Don't know if it was a worthwhile payoff. Solid writing as usual and a  couple of characters who would be interesting to see again if set in  Florida. Eagerly await the next installment in the Jake Lassiter series.  Much more fun than these folks.	1999-01-09
US	52009378	RKQTUQEZIQ1OC	0380723638	202126623	Ill Wind (Anna Pigeon Mysteries)	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Strong protagonist, slow in spots	Decided while visiting National Parks was a good time to check out Park Ranger Anna Pigeon. Took me a little while to &quot;put faces&quot; with all the characters...maybe too many characters. Book moved fast in parts  and plodded in others. Anna Pigeon is a good lead and I enjoyed the writing  style. Will certainly try another in the series.	1998-11-21

It was a perfect setting  for a magnificent read. Call &amp; McCrea, their adversaries and allies  come to life in technicolor. Spent one day hiking the Canyon's South Rim,  stopping to rest and read and what a way to enjoy this great portrayer of  the American West. Don't think it would have mattered where I read it as it  was quite a treat. Being in the Grand Canyon was just a bonus. I have yet  to be disappointed in a McMurtry novel and these characters are full of  life, color and verve.	1998-11-21
US	52009378	R3K4XCEXZE6WEP	0688138217	427654724	Shoot/Don't Shoot (Joanna Brady Mysteries, Book 3)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Solid investigative novel set in Arizona	Chose this as part of vacation reading while on holiday in Scottsdale and was not disappointed. Very fast read and one of those situations you can believe really happens. Sets the scene in the Phoenix area beautifully and  you get to know all the characters quite well. Action is fast paced and  found it successfully resolved. Will go for more in this series. Thought  Joanna Brady to be a worthy protagonist.	1998-11-20
US	52009378	R1MKMDHHT0RY13	0312965028	615414862	Moody Gets the Blues (Moody Gets Blues)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	First in series shows great promise.	Met the author at book signing while on holiday in Scottsdale at Poisoned Pen. Very impressive background and charming speaker. No doubt it is a first novel, but it contains lots of strong moments. Mr. Oliver's  discussion of where his protagonist is going (and growing) whet the  appetite for more of Moody. Moody and his associates in Spokane can make  you laugh and make you cry. You cannot help but care about them.  Interesting plot that is fully resolved.	1998-11-20

Loved the book and feel I have discovered a new writer to look forward to. Characters are well developed  and one can easily care about them. I certainly am interested in the  continuing relationships. Well resolved and has me ready to pick up the  next one in the Ariel series ASAP.	1998-11-20
US	52009378	R10EUNXDHRAEJQ	0316287555	75967530	Day of Confession	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Good, but not as spectacular as his 1st.	To me, &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; was easily the best book I read  in 1994. Since then my anticipation for the follow up was high. I was  thrilled when I saw &quot;Day of Confession&quot; was out. Another complex  plot filled with well defined characters. You can really loathe the evil  doers,  cheer unashamedly for the good guys and feel sad when a good guy  dies. As with &quot;Tomorrow&quot; the reader has to suspend disbelief a  number of times...but isn't that part of what fiction is all about?  Things  move rapidly and you can find yourself knocking off over 100 pages at a  sitting. Mr. Folsom certainly helped the reader this time by providing a  list of the characters with a one line descriptions. This is a welcome aid  until the characters flesh out. It was a fine read, resolved well. It  lacked the knockout punch delived at the end of his &quot;Day After  Tomorrow&quot;.	1998-10-11
US	52009378	R2VWNTSUFHJ2GH	0446600415	619563221	The Day After Tomorrow	Books	5	2	3	N	N	I had to re-read the final ten pages...that's how surprising	I read this back in 1994 and it was the best book I read that year. Since  then I have given it as a gift repeatedly. It never fails to enthrall the  recipient. It is suspenseful, fun, full of twistes and turns. And the  ending was one I never saw coming.  I wish he would write another one.	1998-08-21
US	52009378	R2VGJ1WU0FQFW5	1575663023	567258865	Ulterior Motive	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Got my attention from page one	The author e-mailed me from a review I had done in amazon.com, saying he  thought I would enjoy his debut if I liked the Stephen Hunter novel. I  figured that kind of door to door marketing and belief in one's product was  just novel enough to warrent a looksee. The guy invented the start buttom  for the PC, and that is way more than most accomplish in a lifetime. His  writing career can be just as bright. He makes you care about the  characters and the action really moves. I also liked the way everyone at  Megasoft is known by their e-mail name.  This was a fun read and the pages  flew by.	1998-08-21
US	52009378	R2GKGB7DFTZ8HD	0385480431	490562585	Time to Hunt	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Holds your attention from start to finish.	&quot;Dirty White Boys&quot; was my initial Stephen Hunter read. I then went back and started chronologically. By the time I got to &quot;Point of Impact&quot; I trusted Mr. Hunter. Therefore I did not get distressed with the arcane and detailed info on rifles, ballistics, shooting etc. that began &quot;Point of Impact&quot;. I was rewarded with a wonderfully rich character in Bob Lee Swagger. &quot;Time to Hunt&quot; completes the Swagger trilogy. Again, rich characters whose flaws make them oh so real and compassionate. It is a thriller of the nth degree. As in the previous Swagger stories the true villan is in doubt until the final pages. Then you have to go back and reread the last half dozen or so pages, just to make certain you read it correctly. Mr. Hunter writes with conviction and makes you find time to drop what you should be doing and get back to his book	1998-05-27
