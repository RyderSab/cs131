It begins with the rape and assault of Claire Jordan. Years later, she's a professor now living in Denver with her lover Jane Sellers. She has managed to suppress thoughts of the horrible incident, while her assailant, Gerald Steckman, is supposedly serving a long prison sentence - until her friend's daughter is assaulted. This incident brings back ugly memories Claire thought she'd gotten over. Now that Steckman has attacked Chloe (and raped yet another woman), Claire realizes he's out of prison and believes he has come to Denver to kill her. <br /> <br />With lover Jane and best friends Mattie and Brooke, they plot to track him down. The question comes next of what to do when they find him. Maim him, as he did his victims? Torture him just for kicks? Claire has the answer, unbeknownst to her posse: kill him dead. <br /> <br />The plan, hatched in the confines of the Steel Magnolia, a womyn-only bar, takes on other conspirators, like lovers Michael and Brian and a horde of drag queens and prostitutes who keep an eye on the on the streets for the ladies. Meanwhile, Claire's bought a gun and is learning how to use it. <br /> <br />The novel spends most of its plot on Steckman's capture, but it also lends its time to great character development. Each lady had her own issues: Jane copes (and tolerates) Claire's adulterous behavior while trying to open a woman's art gallery; Mattie and Brooke deal with their daughter's rape while rekindling their broken relationship; and we get into the volatile mind of Steckman. This made for a captivating suspense/romance novel. <br /> <br />The Magnolia Conspiracy is a great piece of work, finally in its complete form after being abridged into Naiad novel Black Iris. We have a book that portrays womyn solidarity at its finest.	2005-03-25

Let's see, there's blindness, secret admirers, car accidents, parental responsibility, anger, infidelity. And oh, let's not forget love, since this is a contemporary romance novel. <br /> <br />Aspiring singer Tammy Gibson became blind after a tragic motorcycle involving her boyfriend, David. They were both 15 at the time, young and in love. Yet David abandoned Tammy after learning she will never be able to see again, guilt destroying his heart and conscience. <br /> <br />Years later, Tammy becomes a Julliard-trained singer with a couple of unsuccessful albums to her credit and still striving for stardom. She hasn't quite hit the big time and is hoping for that great producer/songwriter that will help her gain the recognition she deserves. <br /> <br />In walks Sterling Phillips, a former renowned R&B songwriter with several hits under his belt. He takes a strong liking to Tammy - maybe because he's known her most of their lives. He's the David that caused her to lose her vision - with a new name - unbeknownst to Tammy. All she knows is that Sterling is the father of her blind tutee, Kevin. Kevin became sightless after Sterling was the cause of another car accident, this time involving his wife, Kayla, and Kevin. Unfortunately, Kayla was killed. Sterling carries the guilt from both around tragedies to the point where his health is endangered. <br /> <br />However, Tammy and Sterling manage to fall in love, with his identity unknown. With her love and support, Sterling creates new songs her, his inspiration restored after being suppressed for so long. Tammy has aroused feelings he never knew he had. Together they create beautiful music and Tammy finally gets her long-awaited shot at stardom, with buzz around her intensifying. <br /> <br />Yet Sterling still hasn't told her who he is, and it's only a matter of time with a snooping tabloid reporter on his trail. I'm not going to spoil the ending, but it wraps up nicely. <br /> <br />Author Beverly Clark did a wonderful job with the plot, but the writing was a little exasperating at times. I just felt frustrated at the questioning nature of the characters, with their innermost thoughts detailed to death. It made the story labor-intensive for me. <br /> <br />But Clark is a writer I would read again.  <br />	2005-03-25

Angel, Ericka, and Faith are the shining stars \\"Brave New World,\\" where all the usual backstabbing, cattiness and illicit affairs are thrown in for good measure. Hilmon delivers an entertaining plot and fleshed characters who are hard to forget.    Angel is the more centered of the three, the peacemaker with her own issues - mainly sleeping with unattainable men and living promiscuously. (Unattainable: read bisexual). Could it stem from the fact that was raised by an abusive father? That her cool confidence masks a fragile heart?    Angel does befriend Faith, the new white girl on the block. A replacement for Khandi, a sistah fired from the show, Faith has been met with an icy reception since her arrival. At first taken aback by her \\"extreme beauty,\\" Angel learns Faith is a nave woman with a past, and the two bond quickly. Faith craves attention herself and finds it in Randall, the unhappily married producer of \\"Brave,\\" and in a secret admirer bordering on obsession.    On every show, in every book, there's always the [...] -- am I right? In steps Ericka, the conniving, cunning whore who doesn't allow anyone to control her - except her mother, Victoria. Worse than Mommie Dearest, Ericka's matriarch has pushed her most of her life to be everything she couldn't. Victoria's obsessive behavior has paid off; Ericka's been highly successful as an actress (though some doubt her abilities). But her mother's manipulation leads Ericka to out-of-control behavior. It's only when Victoria threatens to take the most precious thing away from her that Ericka ultimately stands up for herself.    Hilmon is on his stuff with this outing. Divalicious is delicious fun that plays out as most soap opera fare, complete with bed hopping and man stealing. The end wraps up a little too neatly, what with everyone uniting as one big happy family. Everyone manages to get it together for the sake of new baby Hope. I won't give away whose child it is. You'll just have to stay tuned to find out.	2004-12-12

King's part informative, part personal book exposing the trend of down-low African-American men who sleep with other men leaves a bittersweet taste in my mouth. Granted, I commend him confronting this decadent truth that many women (and some men) don't seem to know about or turn a blind eye to. He provides an honest look at what this DL behavior is doing to our communities, our homes and our relationships, and paints a disturbing portrait of the rise of HIV among young people. King also imparts prudent advice to women looking for signs about their men and counsels them to care about themselves and their health a little more.<br />Yet, how can a man who sleeps with another man deny his own sexuality? That, in my opinion, is the root of this problem. That disavowal of who they are is what's killing African-American women and men at an alarming rate. Although King does tell men to be honest with their partners, making them aware of their sexual tastes, he doesn't encourage men to confront their own sexuality enough. Labels aside, you should get to know yourself before you get involved with someone else. They don't have to scream it to the world, but at least to thine own self be true. As Black women, we will always stand behind our men, and for us they need to be honest with themselves.<br />For what it's worth, King has done his homework and gotten in touch with himself about his life and issues. I applaud him. For our sistahs and brothas' sakes, DL men should do the same.	2004-05-19

I guess that's a bad sign. I do plan to finish it, though.<br />I'll give it to Ms. Danquah - Shaking the Tree is a ecletic collection of women's prose and memoir, but the book is slow. There are selections about racism, politics and sexuality. Yet they don't personally move or stir me. I just can't put my finger on it. I first bought Shaking for its intriguing subject matter, however once I got into it, nothing clicked for me. I give it 3 stars for its efforts.<br />But read it for yourself.

My Sister's Keeper pretends to be just a lengthy tale, but somehow permeates itself into your heart by novel's close. Conceived to be a donor to leukemia-ridden Kate, Anna has been poked and prodded through several medical treatments to save her sister's life. She's tired of it all. Anna just wants to be left alone, made to feel normal, and allowed to be her own person. At least that's the story Anna tells her lawyer. Underneath it all, everyone's got a story and is lead by their own emotions to do what's best for Kate, as evidenced by the plot's seven different viewpoints. I wept for Anna and Kate, wrestled with Sara and Brian, and hoped for Campbell and Julia. Jodi Picoult has a flair for rich, colorful characterizations and for weaving an affecting yarn. A little long winded, but I loved it. I mean, it's been a while since a book has made me cry like a baby.	2004-04-14

Scooter, at the tender age of five, witnessed his mother kill his father, although he quickly buried the memory in his subconscious. Soon after he was brought to the New York neighborhood by his elderly grandparents, and became fast friends with Juanita. With her fair skin and piercing green eyes, Juanita doesn't really belong anywhere. She doesn't resemble her Aunt Hattie or Uncle Herbie who raised her under false pretenses; she isn't accepted by the darker-colored sistahs who berate her because &quot;she thank she cute&quot;; and her full-figured body won't fit in the White-washed world with the &quot;beautiful people.&quot; Yet, Scooter and Juanita become each other's world, comfort, and resting place to lay their burdens down.<br />It's only when Juanita finds true love with Conan, a respectful young Hispanic man, that the fast-paced, dramatic climax of the novel takes shape. A titillating read, Tracy Price-Thompson knows how to weave a tale of intrigue and forgiveness and learning to love one's true self. Highly recommended!	2004-02-04

They believe the way to a person's heart is through sex and money, and that lovers are as indispensable as Kleenex. <br />Case in point: Kayla is an intelligent sistah who looks for love in all the wrong places. After spending a day or even a few hours with a guy, she's imagining their wedding and having their children. After running into several \\"nuts,\\" she finally meets Wil, a charming cat who sweeps her off her feet with gifts and fabulous lovemaking. Yet, he turns out to be a typical alley cat after Kayla finds out Wil is married with a child. <br />All along the way is nice-guy Samir. He's always had a thing for her, but Kayla wouldn't give him the time of day - until Wil breaks her heart. Finding herself alone, she gives Samir a chance. At one point, she even dates both men. I won't spoil the ending, but even at the novel's close, we haven't found a new, enlightened Kayla. We find the same naïve girl still trying to find love anywhere she can get it.<br />Granted there are a lot of older generations still struggling with the same issues. Yet this book, as well as it's written, points out all the flaws of our youth - especially women who deal with the fact that they never had a positive male figure in their lives. Okay, now I'm off my soapbox!<br />I did think the novel was well written. I felt as if Kayla was really genuine and was true to form.

No longer is the issue just about equality; most importantly, it's about respect for all women.  Joan Morgan writes with passion, intelligence and humor, and presents common sense answers to topics such as the empowerment of women, the misogyny plaguing hip-hop, the plight of black male-female relationships, and the encouragement of self-love.<br />I found Joan ideas to be refreshing to a world where monogamy is dying, our Black homes are torn apart, and children grow up far too fast. This is a book for not only Black women to read, especially but it's one that should be shared with future generations of African-American girls and boys. They need to learn the concepts of self-love and respect for the opposite sex.<br />Chickenheads is a great stepping stone to repairing our community and our souls.	2003-12-02

In her weekly entries, Nelson discusses what she has or has not read, what attracted her to certain books, and how those books intertwine with her life. What really makes this book stand out is Nelson's witty repartee, her ability to make me laugh out loud and recognize just how much we have in common. The book also works because of Nelson's various experiences in the publishing word where she's been a reporter and a reviewer, among other things. <br />Book Lovers, we finally have something that unites us!

Although she loves her mother dearly, her only wish is to know who her father was. All she's ever really known about Bird was that he was a Vietnam War veteran.<br />Bird was so much more than that, as we find out. Miriam has a past with Bird that goes a lot deeper than Aya could ever know. But sadly, she never finds out because her life is tragically taken from her by police who mistakenly kill her.

I won't spoil the the novel, but the hijinks Lydia and Acey endure are worth the lenghty 318 pages \\"Sexual Healing\\" boasts. I laughed out loud at the bold Lydia and sympathized with the laid back Acey.<br />One thing that makes the book so good is the attention to detail. Nelson writes to not only entertain, but to educate. What could have simply been a raunchy sex tale (which partly it is) turns into a book about sexuality with pinches of racism, chauvinism, and feminism.

Brown has written a book that could be written from the life of a lot of lesbians. The writing and the plot were realistic and engaging. I followed the twists and turns of the Chris and Gayle, who each had her own story to tell and crosses to bear. I didn't really believe the ending was realistic, though; I guess I was expecting it to end differently. (Don't worry, I'm not going to give it away!) The moral of &quot;Fire and Brimstone&quot; is we are all flawed, sin and fall short. That's what makes us human. We have to figure out what's truly in our heart and learn to live with it. At the same time, we should also acknowledge there is a higher power that keeps us every day.

This was the book I was waiting for: a lighthearted, honest farce about love from the lesbian perspective. Elizabeth Dean has written a novel that breaks the perceptions of the \\"typical\\" lesbian, who is usually a grassroots womyn who has a hankering for the Indigo Girls. Not that those women don't exist or that there's something wrong with that, but there is another side to the female-oriented culture. How about woman who is cosmopolitan, aggressively feminine and who'd rather listen to Celine Dion than k.d. lang? Those women do exist and Elizabeth does a great job portraying them and breaking down the highs and lows of finding love. <br />Enter Gracy, Parker, Blair, and Lindsey, four women who meet at a party and become instantly bonded. They share their trials about meeting women, being in love -- and staying there. Gracy, a freelance writer, is the sensible narrator who guides us through the novel with ease. As a writer, she intersperses her columns between chapter, which deal with contemporary romantic issues as \\"Sex or Love: Which Comes First?\\"<br />Overall, the book is truly hilarious, especially a certain scene with an overzealous activist who confronts the girls. Honestly, this is the type of book that should be made into a TV show: \\"Sex and the City\\" -- lesbian style. It would definitely get great ratings.	2003-09-13

Odessa Rose took us through the emergence of Tonya Mimms' newfound sexuality, her self-acceptance, first female relationship, and finally her coming out. From beginning to end I found myself so engrossed with Tonya that I just couldn't put it down. I only wish that I could find out what happened to Tonya after she comes out to her family. I'm dying for a sequel. Rose writes a very genuine and involved novel that I could read time and time again. The words were so poetic and lyrical, but it rang of honesty and simplicity. A definite classic for any Black lesbian - or any lesbian or African American for that matter.	2003-09-13
US	43037403	R2VGZZHL72A4HV	0679721819	255129502	Mama Day	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Moving and Lyrical	Once I began reading Mama Day, Gloria Naylor's folklore novel, I just couldn't put it down. This is one of the best books I've ever read. The plot was kind of slow-building, but as I got to know everyone in Willow Springs, I felt like they were family. Cocoa and George were a moving couple, and it just broke my heart when ... oh well, I won't give away the ending. What really impressed me about Mama Day was the strength of Naylor's writing. Having to juggle three completely different character plots, she managed to give each one an authentic voice. The depth of her characterization was truly amazing. If you want to read a book that is moving, hilarious, and mythical, please read Mama Day.	2003-09-12

Even at the bookstore, a woman said, \\"That is a powerful book. You'll enjoy it.\\" Feeling good, I purchased it and wondered what could be so captivating about a drug dealer's daughter learning the ropes on the streets. I soon found out. The Coldest Winter Ever ranks as one the best books I've ever read. Compelling, wild, motivating, humorous, heartbreaking, and depressing -- there aren't enough words to describe what I felt when I finished Sister Souljah's tale. As I was reading, I kept hoping Winter would realize the mistakes she was making. I wished that Souljah, portrayed as herself in the novel, could have helped her turn her life around. I think Winter one of those rare characters that you root for and hate with a passion. Souljah has written a superior book. Very eye-opening.	2003-09-12

This book was quirky, upbeat, happy, optimistic, and entertaining. It isn't depressing, heartbreaking, or gloomy. It was pure entertainment. I laughed at Dean's humorous plot about the staff of a lesbian television station, who schemes against the boss to take over the company. I fell in love with all the characters, especially C.J., Maria, and Shantel. The writing was superb and kind of different. I'm very much looking forward to a sequel or any other book written by Elizabeth Dean. Thank you for making a light, entertaining read!	2003-09-12

The book focuses on three women at the Meridian Southwest phone company: Faulkner, an ambitious young manager; Joyce, her hard-nosed, power hungry boss; and Margaret, the motherly employee who has nurtured both women as she watched them rise to power -- while standing still herself. What I enjoyed about the novel is that as women, Faulkner, Joyce and Margaret each have their own strengths and weaknesses, and strive to accomplish their own goals. Camika Spencer illustrates that these ladies have personal lives outside the workplace, which definitely have an effect on their workplace demeanor. Faulkner appears to be a pushover; Joyce is battling demons from her past; and Margaret has a lazy, self-absorbed daughter. Although the book can be a little tedious at times and the dialogue a little stilted, Cubicles is definitely an excellent take on workplace fiction.	2003-09-11

The women meet and become fast friends, and soon, they begin a love affair so explosive it shakes the very core of their sexualities. <br />The only problem is Vic already has a commitment to her BMOC boyfriend, Charly. As a modern Southern belle, her hand is practically promised to the well-to-do, handsome football player. Although Vic's heart quivers for Charly, it burns passionately for Chris. So what's a girl to do, especially when you are raised with a genteel upbringing? She spends the majority of the novel trying to understand her new feelings and how to break it to Charly.<br />And in the midst of her discovery is a cast of Southern eccentrics, who add a life to what could have been a dull take on lesbian love. There's her levelheaded parents, Frank and R. J., her bold Aunt Bunny, and her outrageous younger sister, Mignon. Intensifying the madcap is the Wallace family, who take the term \\"hillbilly\\" to another level.<br />The only thing that made the book tedious was Vic's wavering attitude toward ending her relationship with Charly.  I kept wondering when she would finally bite the bullet and just be honest with everyone. Although it had a slow start, the book held my interest as I kept reading on. Thanks, Rita, for making me laugh and making me think.	2003-09-11

Michael Gainer's book is shallow, predictable, and in need of serious editing. I give him props for giving women (and men) tips on the game and the fact that Keith learned his lesson in the end. However, this novel was not well written at all. Playa, please go back and learn the game of editing (or at least find someone who can do it for you).	2003-08-19

I had no idea when I pulled this book out of my bag during my summer vacation that it would be so good. Omar Tyree has created an intriguing story that kept me enthralled to the end. I was so captivated by Tabitha and her mission to bring down a famous actor who preys on young women. It was crazy to see just who were the \\"bad guys,\\" and who would come to Tabitha's rescue. The book did have its weak moments, times when the dialogue was choppy, but overall it kept me on the edge of my seat. Some of the reviewers of \\"Diary\\" I think took the book too seriously. It's meant to be a thriller, but kind of lighthearted at the same time. I mean, how else could you root for a character who made her living sleeping with celebrities, many who were married with children? Just take the book for what it is: a summer read that entertains and holds your interest. And besides, the way the book ended, you can tell it's headed for a sequel.	2003-08-14

I was expecting an intelligent novel about the lesbian lifestyle with a little erotica thrown in for fun. Now what I got was a trite, unorganized novel. I applaud James D. Jackson for his effort to create a story about alternate lifestyles, but the endeavor was lost between the grammatical errors and inconsistencies. The characterizations could have been a lot better; adding names to each chapter so we don't get confused as to who is speaking would help. And this novel really does nothing to help the perceptions of lesbians. In fact, this book was somewhat demeaning. Does Donna's mother, the so-called \\"sociologist,\\" really have to be held as a genius when her theory of homosexuality is so incorrect? I can't believe that an educated woman would spout garbage like that; every lesbian has not been molested, raped or had a bad experience with men. The bad thing about this book is that people who don't know better will buy into this stereotype. Please don't believe the hype. Try reading more realistic novels like \\"Loving Her\\" by Ann Shockley or \\"Water in a Broken Glass\\" by Odessa Rose. You'll get a lot more out of them.	2003-07-01
US	43037403	RKKCUCZ7ITFQ0	1558612165	666224495	The Chinese Garden	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Interesting but Slow	Rachel is a young girl residing at Bampfield, a boarding school that regards its students as masculine and embraces independence. Here Rachel hates the Bampfield regime, but finds pleasure in garden not far from the school grounds. Its Oriental theme and beauty captivate her. This is her refuge away from her academia life. <br />At Bampfield, Rachel is surrounded by friends: the almost-impossible Margaret the needy Bisto. Margaret is the 'rebel' who introduces her to the garden and tells her about a new book, 'The Well of Loneliness,' which is creating quite a stir because of its 'racy' theme. <br />I won't give away much more, but naive Rachel comes of age in this novel. She learns about the true nature of people, especially when a controversy arises within the book. I enjoyed the language of 'The Chinese Garden' although the real meat of the story comes at the far end. I was waiting patiently throughout the book -- it was definitely worth the wait.	2003-06-24

He spends the story attempting to win Nicole's affections from her lover, a tough talking attorney who isn't taking no for an answer.<br />I applaud Dickey for trying a plot that hasn't been done before in mainstream African-American fiction. However, the plot was, at times, a little unbelievable. I found it a bit annoying for a man to keep holding on to a woman who was so clearly selfish and unsure of whom she wanted. At one point, I was rooting for him to win Nicole's heart, and by the next few chapters, I was hoping he would just let her go.<br />This novel also does not improve society's misunderstood perception of the bisexual lifestyle. People tend to think bis spend their days (and nights!) jumping between both sexes, but there are a great deal more who can settle down and commit to one person, no matter what the gender.<br />But EJD's writing is, as always, superb and he always offers enough twists and turns to keep me hanging on to his every word. I did enjoy Between Lovers for its originality. Keep writing, EJD!	2003-03-27

There isn't enough that I can say about &quot;If Beale Street Could Talk.&quot; It was one of the most captivating, loving, and pure novels ever written. I was moved by the love of Tish and Fonny, how their love grew naturally from childhood and blossomed into adulthood. That love transcends the prison which Fonny can't escape; that same love will set him free. I also appreciated the strong bond of Tish's family and Fonny's father, who work tirelessly to help this young man out of prison. It's refreshing to see a Black family come together in a dire time of need. This was a excellent novel for all Black readers and especially for all others who want to understand the Black experience.	2003-02-03
