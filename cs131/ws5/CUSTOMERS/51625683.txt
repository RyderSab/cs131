As I said, the author inserts paragraphs using poetic prose with polished wording mixed with plain action language.   Anticipation and suspense have to be worked better as well as the after effect of twist and turns to provoke the anxiety of the reader to grab the book, not too much effort devoted to this point  Characters are slowly crafted but swiftly killed as book is coming to an end, there are just too many, as well as events surrounding them  Elements from the surreal and fantastic worlds blend with reality so some chapters get difficult to follow and in the end to understand what the author had in mind	2005-07-04

I have to point out that this is a book about psychology not business. <br /> <br />I do not know if this book became a best-seller in the US but in my country certainly did and I am grateful it came to my hands. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-18

The authors propose then ten effective pathways to avoid gossip, using Bible wisdom, universal quotes, elements of the Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism) as source and contemporary everyday \\"The Jonesses\\" stories as examples of how gossip harmfully interferes and distorts the course of events destroying reputations, lives, old friendships, and partnerships     At the end, there is a useful summary of the gists of everyone of the chapters for practical everyday use.

The Swiss banker collection has a lot to do with the Nazi ransacking of very valuable art works placed in galleries across the Europeans countries occupied by Nazi Germany during the Second World War, most of these art galleries were Jewish owned. After the pillage, The Nazi sold the art works by way of unscrupulous Swiss uppers class bankers having shady deals with them <br />So, Silva wants to leave a moral message, and that is that Swiss neutrality has nothing to do with politics but greed, an unethical policy that took Switzerland to rank among the countries with the highest material standards of living of the world, then neutrality carries its sinister reasons, It is the country where the great robbers used and use to deposit their booties protected by the laws of bank secrecy, Switzerland is not a country but a Big Bank that will not atone for the sins of the past and will not feel responsible for the consequence of its actions in the future, a country that makes business out of the money embezzled everywhere around the world<br />With a polished prose, great writing skills, crime fiction elements and international thriller settings, Silva has made worth reading a great enlightening work, showing that he has become a great writer with a great future.	2004-06-21

I thought that the plot followed a consistent  previous investigation by the author<br />The tale revolves around three main characters very well developed at the beginning, Thea the raped woman who suffers post traumatic stress disorder after such tragic event, David his estranged son, the product of that rape, and Jack and ex LAPD cop who happens to be Thea's landlord and who learns to like the kid <br />When David becomes a teenager, he begins to wonder about his mother weird behaviour and his own past, so one day makes the decision to find out who his father was and runs away from home with outside help, traveling to the opposite side of the country,  Thea shocked, runs after him and Jack also very attached to the boy goes after Thea, hereafter the story loses realism.<br />My criticism toward this book points towards the lack of purpose, you do not really undestand if the author objective was to explore the feelings of the woman after the rape or write a mystery tale leaving the former on the background<br />In fact, characters are well drawn, but suspense and actions are not, let me elaborate some situations to clarify my point: <br />It is difficult to understand how Jack, with computers a layman, uses Thea's password after founding it \\"casually\\" written in a paper placed near the computer and then access to all her private recorded internet chat conversations, on top of that he prints them out, consequently it is very difficult to understand how Thea, a phobic, leaves her password written on a paper that can be found by anyone<BR> <BR>It is difficult to understand how Thea took a cross-country flight carrying a weapon and being undetected<br />It is difficult to understand how Jack and Thea get face to face interviews with important secluded peopleof the upper crust of Long Island on arrival, without an appointment and even without mentioning their names in advance<br />Finally, I can also notice that the author was unable to create logical connections between events, some of them very confusing. The story loses almost all credibility <br />At one point, there was a ray of hope to improve what was done, with a sudden turn of events, that was when Thea learned that the jailed rapist turned out not to be the actual rapist, that situation could have been exploited far better than it was and \\"Violation\\" would  have probably been a very interesting read from that section<br />Due to the reasons mentioned above, to rate this book two stars is too much, one<BR>will suffice	2002-04-27

Harper is a good citizen, reports this immediately to the police which involves also the FBI in a nationwide search to identify and put this loony behind bars <br />At the same time, Harper hides a family secret he cannot reveal to his wife for the sake of his marriage, that bit is very juicy, adds a lot of drama to the tortured mind of Harper and becomes more interesting than the main line of the story. Will he tell this dark secret to his wife, how will she react ?<br />When it comes to the ending there is not a stunning definition in line with such a long story, everything is left to an endless array of useless details replacing the unexpected twists and turns a novel like this one should have.

In my opinion Mr. Grisham has provided an involuntary strong influence on Lisa Scottoline, this book looks like a copycat but cannot attain the level of the former writer. With a quick pace marked by short chapters and with a poor language improper for a legal-thriller, the author is determined to trap the reader into the plot and scores, because as the pages go by, she learns how to exploit the story setting the mystery out and then turning it into tight suspense which snowballs toward the last chapters, but when you finish the book and look at it as a whole in retrospect, it is easy to perceive loose ends during the course of the events as the author falls sometimes in traps set by her own creative ideas, leaving some important situations unresolved or sidestepped, this go hand to hand with the flabby character drawing and shows a definitive poor writing style.	2001-10-28

Suspense was not well recreated when it has to be done and I could count just only one interesting twist that turns the whole story the other way, now Pellam goes after the perpetrators of the crime (the Feds, the thugs) , trying to find who was behind that act and why. <br />This novel was written around or before 1993, it is clear that at that time Mr. Deaver was polishing his writing skills in order to become the excellent writer that he is today. So I conclude that William Jefferies and Jeffery Deaver are both the same \\"individual\\" but two different \\"writers\\" <br />If you are looking for a good location scout mystery series novel, better try another attempt like Shallow Graves, is in my opinion the best of the trilogy (Shallow Graves - Bloody River Blues - Hell's Kitchen)	2001-04-20

I enjoyed this book, because this colorful story is so well written, that you can feel the tension and hostility against Pellam every step of the way and dont know what is coming up next, that is what I would call, suspense !, but what I liked the most is the great character drawing, and the dialogues, with just a few words when facing each other, they tell you all, how they actually are, their intentions, how they really feel and what you could expect of them, concocted with many dimensions, they looked like they were ready to jump off the book and sit right next to you. Also, I have another compliment for the twists in the story, this is a resource widely used by Mr Deaver in all his books, they were not many but those few under his sleeve were masterfully used at the right time, rocking my chair.

They did not look very realistic,indeed, on the other hand you will find an original gripping story plenty of action with many twists and turns, most of them very cleverly conceived particularly in the final chapters of the book.	2000-12-08

After receiving a letter he discovers that he is innocent and files and appeal with the US Supreme Court because he is well aware that he was a victim of a conspiracy of a group that will do the impossible to cover it up, this appeal is found by a clerk who gets so astounded that begins an investigation on his own bending the standard  procedures of the US Supreme Court and so putting his brilliant life and career at risk<br />Regardless of the mystery (who is behind the cover up and why), the best feature of the plot, is the trickery subtly outlined behind the scenes, how Mr Baldacci deceives the reader in terms of characters' behavior and attitudes throughout the whole book from beginning to end and how he also flawlessly solve the puzzle without to rely on the last of the minute non sense sudden turn of the events, a subterfuge very usually employed by many well known mystery writers. For this reason this book stands out from the pack.	2000-11-28

It is a very long book with and intricate plot, breakneck pace and too many twist and turns (just too many, one gets tired of them) as well as a lot of action packed suspense in short time spans. Characters pop up and disappear more than often murdered, obviously with an explanation not credible enough, showing a poor writing style. Though Mr Forsyth wrote few thrillers, they were terrific and released after a long and thorough research for the delight of his readers. Conversely, this Folsoms book is just the conception of a plain far fetched childish fantasy about a German neo nazy conspiracy for a new Reich resurgence and employs the old worn formula \\"the good guys\\" taking on the \\"bad guys \\"playing a sort of chess game and a long tiresome chase throughout the whole book which seems never ending.	2000-11-19

He is convinced they are innocent and that is how the story starts. Though the tale keeps a steady firm pace, I can affirm that then ending is the best and richest part of the book, it is full of intrigue, twisty and features something I have not seen in another mystery books and that is the deftly sudden alteration of the profile of characters, how an innocent victim can become the devil and the other way around, this was performed with mastery, brilliant narrative tactics and not relying on easy trickery. Big praise for Freedman, he is a great novelist, this book as well as his others &quot;Key Witness&quot; and &quot;The Disappearance&quot; are worth reading.	2000-10-24

At the same time one also knows  that he has set the devil loose playing with the good guys and wonders who  might be, this book brushes up on riddles and is a riddle on itself Near  the ending, as usual, he will dump at top speed all the tricky aces he has  concealed under his sleeve, disclosing the culprit and finding an  explanation to justify each and every event , giving the answers to all the  questions that every reader may pose to him (How he did that ?. How this  could happen ?,.. It is not too much ?), (well, I do not agree with many of  the answers, they seemed a bit far-fetched. The assets of this book: Deaver  is showing again his quality as a top notch thriller writer displaying a  great writing style and great character development (particularly Kincaid  and the Digger), handling suspense as few other authors can do and showing  that he has done a thorough research about what he is lecturing about, in  this case (writing interpretation applied to crime investigation) and those  facts show a lot of respect for his readers. ( I like this ! ) The  liability of this book is  the contrived ending, with lots of twist and  turns in just a handful of pages which happen as miracles in a very short  time (hours), making difficult to believe them,  (...but a little fantasy  in a book is not forbidden,  is it ?..) In my opinion, for future books he  has to make some changes in his plot schemes to surprise his avid old fans,  who no longer get shocked with his twist and turns because they are  expecting them.	2000-08-01

Pure psychological stuff, I dont see neither a thriller nor a true crime, kind of plot .The  action progresses slowly, far from the pulse of a rollercoaster ride, It  would have been more dynamic and entertaining if the author had included  rich action packed suspense, with some turns and provived better forensic  elements with  scientific explanations to complement the events, I cannot  understand also why Harris has devoted so many chapters to develop the  murderer background in the middle of the book, shifting the focus, and not  just from the start. Graham the retired brainy cop back on track following  the clues to catch the assasin, looks promising at the outset but then  dissapoints (I could not smell a cop in him), his lackluster role revolves  around his private conflicts with the job due to past experiences, being  unable to be shown as the actual antagonist to the bad guy. The ending,  credible, was great and helped to enlighten the tale but for the most part,  the story was not appealing and the narrative at some points confusing and  difficult to follow.	2000-07-22

Throughout a very detailed physical, satirical and, psychological observation of the  ambitions and careers of members of the different social rungs of the  Atlanta and America social ladder, Wolfe weaves a story which never falters  from beginning to end and maintains the same level of writing style and  quality in every chapter. All the characters, stereotyped ones, move  interrelated because the actions of some of them bring big misfortunes to  the life of others,  All share problems in common, that is, making a  living, maintaining an image and keeping their high living standards and  everyone of them seem to say\\". Look, I have a situation here...\\"and are  shown enduring their existence in relation to the events that come to their  lives. The magic lies in the way the reader is introduced to the life of  the character, because one reads and wish to make judgments about  everything unexpected that happens, kind of (What I would do in this case ?  What if..?) All characters receive equal treatment under the pen of the  author, the top tycoon, the frustrated professional and the humblest  worker. Pain and disappointment are part of life for all of them and no  matter the money and prestige they have or don't have, they must confront  and solve complex problems entailing difficult decisions sometimes under  big pressure as tough they were hanging on the edge of a cliff.  I would  have changed the title of this book for another one \\".Life in  full.......\\".because some passages provide useful examples and others  remarkable observations applying to everyday life ranging from the most  important circumstances to the less significant ones.

If there is no entertainment and interest, then there is no link between the reader and the plot, as a result then the book ceases to exist and turns out into some scribbled sheets glued with a cover, but in \\"The  Disappearance\\", things are absolutely the other way around, the author made  a hell of a job conceiving this whodunit puzzle with strong court action  drama.

This my third Connelly book after The Black Echo and The Black Ice, (I  recommend to read them in this order) and Mr Connelly, has again as in the  others, developed his unique skills too create fast paced action packed  suspense and to easily manipulate the reader the way he wants providing  also a thorough knowledge of the setting, the city of LA with its dregs. At  the same time that Harry Bosch is on trial for pulling the trigger  &quot;too quick&quot;, he gets in his crosshairs several suspects to  investigate (one at a time), and that brings along excellent opportunities  to unfold the outstanding suspense when he follows them, in addition the  trial provides further entertainment, great court action, and more positive  confusion. Unfortunately, I can see some flaws; the suspects are  investigated for reasons not too clear, (looks like if you are close to  Harry he will investigate you), on top of that our hero makes it again  catching the bad guy employing his great proficiency and brainy capacity,  but this time he gets too much help of &quot;his father&quot; Mr. Connelly  who turns around all the events for Harry Bosch the easy way with the  typical ending.

The main feature is the  sick relationship between these two characters, I would not place this book  in a mistery novel as one can suppose why the weird things are happening (  it is not the typical whodunit ).

Very gripping.., like driving a race car at fast speed in a road with many bumps, twists and turns. This is my second Philip Margollin book, my first one was The Last Innocent Man and what I see in both of them is that the  author is centered on the going of the action and very skillful to create  packed suspense out of the most simple circumstances. However. In my  opinion as a reader, Mr Margollin should develop more deeply all his  characters (lawyers, cops, judges, criminals), I mean, to give more  dimensions to them besides their role in respect of the action, and also to  provide more vivid and colorful descriptions of the settings (Cities,  Houses, Courts, Cars, Whatever) where they play.  In some chapters the  mistery is not worked enough and in some events the situation is so simple  that one can anticipate what is coming (I will not mention them for the  benefit of other readers), so it is necessary to add other false clues to  confuse and deceive the reader. Overall, is a good book in terms of action  and suspense, I like it very much and took a weekend to finish it. Great  company for a rainy day at home or a cloudy day in the beach.	1999-12-27

This time Harry is driven down to the US- Mexican border in his quest to solve a drug related crime of an  anti-narcotics unit cop who apparently crossed to the bad side of the line.  Harry, stubborn, bright and cunning makes his own decisions, shows a little  quota of contempt and rebels himself against his bosses making him an  example of self determination and a character of his own.<br />In my opinion,  this work would have been a little bit better if in some chapters action  were slowed down in exchange for more suspense, adding bogus elements,  scary episodes and false clues to confuse and frighten the reader moving  him down to the edge of his chair, Nevertheless, the book is compelling,  original, very graphic, entertaining and though keeping on a main line of  investigation all the way along, ends with a master twist (the best) that  almost knocked me off my own chair showing the top quality of Mr. Connelly  as a crime writer	1999-12-20

Bearing this book an appealing cover with so many great recommendations from prestigious authors I expected much more for my money <br />Hunter made the effort but could not conceive a story good enough to reflect the compelling recommendations he has achieved to promote his work. <br />Throughout the chapters I could not find smart twist and turns, bogus elements and other subterfuges that can wake up a sleepy reader. To make it worse, I also found a poor employment of language and the ending did not score to make out for the flabby plot.	1999-07-13

Could not forget the chilling climate of this plot ever. I would placed it among the best crime novels I've ever read. Superb.	1999-06-26
