I have not even opened my set of books yet. This is my back-up set. I read the Trilogy at LEAST once a year. At that rate, I wear out my copies within a few years. I never want to be without and so I have my next set ready to go!<br />I know it is hard to understand, if you haven't read the books, how these books can be for children, young adults, and adults and be compelling for all. But the sheer overwhelming enthusiasm these books generate should tell you that you are not dealing with ordinary or even extraordinary stories. These books are on a level all their own. The magnitude of the creativity and detail is awe-inspiring. The characters are unique, fully-developed personalities. That is amazing in itself considering how many characters there are.<br />In December 2001, the &quot;Lord of the Rings Trilogy&quot; movies will start being released. Whether the movies are good (hopefully) or bad I hope the exposure will inspire many more readers to experience the books. I wanted to share my deep love of these books with anyone who may become curious about what these stories are all about. No matter how the movies turn out you WILL NOT be disappointed by the books!!! OUTSTANDING!!!	2001-02-06

(Mackenzies Mountain, Mackenzies Mission, and A Game of Chance). However  since I had never met Chance in the other books I'd read, it was  interesting to see how he interacted with the other Mackenzies. His  relationships with Zane and Wolf were as touching as the one with Sunny.  <br />Chance went to alot of trouble to set up an &quot;accidental&quot;  meeting with Sunny, the daughter of an international terrorist. He was  determined to use her to track down her father. Two big problems interupted  this great plan. 1. Sunny had no contact with her father. 2. Chance and  Sunny found themselves instantly drawn to each other. They both had some  issues to work out,(and a mission to complete), but eventually they found  themselves back on Mackenzies Mountain. There with the help of the family  they learned to put the past behind them. What a great way to end this  series!	2000-08-17

Inca has been one of my favorite characters from past Morgans Mercenaries. She has always been so mysterious and powerful. I was hoping as we got to  know her, she wouldn't lose that mystique. ALL'S WELL! Inca and Roan both  walked a fine line between power and emotion. They were a fantastically  well matched pair. The only way to describe these two is, PASSIONATE,  STRONG, AND DETERMINED! <br />The mission to destroy drug labs in the amazon  basin was definitely only a mild diversion. Even the bad blood between the  Colonel leading the mission and Inca (their guide), barely caused a ripple.  The focus is firmly on Inca and Roan just as it should be. This story is  more 'mystical' than the previous Morgans Mercenaries. Some people may not  enjoy that as much but it was perfect for a story about Inca. TERRIFIC!	2000-08-17

Needless to say, Joe  takes Carolines attitude as a direct challenge, and she soon finds herself  in over her head. Throw in a little government espionage, and you have one  fantastic story. It's Joe and Caroline that carry the story completely  though. They are magnetic and passionate. A VERY enjoyable story!	2000-08-14

We are dropped into the middle of  a story and have to work our way backward with Jay (and then Steve) to  figure out whats happening and who to trust. <br />Jay is taken to the  hospital bedside of her ex-husband, who she hasn't seen in 5yrs, and asked  to identify him. He has been hurt in a bomb explosion and has his head and  hands bandaged. She is uncertain if the man is Steve, but after a  discussion with FBI agent Frank Payne, they determine that he is Steve and  he is going to need her help to recover. So begins a series of questions  and events that keep all the characters off balance. The one stable force  for Jay and Steve is their growing connection to each other. It is  instantaneous and powerful! Steves' iron will and determination in the face  of overwhelming odds; loss of speech, sight and memory; inspire awe from  Jay. She is completely commited to aiding him, and protecting him if  necessary. Their bond is beautiful to watch as it is based on senses other  than sight. Really compelling!!!

I, like most of the previous reviewers, have been hooked on Christine Feehan since the first page of the first book (Dark Prince). I was also worried that Dark Magic could not live up to my expectations. NO NEED TO  WORRY! This book is terrific! Gregori is more powerful, compelling, and  dangerous than ever. Savannah is completely overwhelmed by him at first.  She has lived a life of love and happiness with Carpathians and humans  alike. She is terribly frightened of Gregori (as any sane being would be)  but is more frightened by her own INTENSE feelings for him. Gregori, on the  other hand, has always been alone. He has been waiting centuries for  Savannah and literally CAN NOT wait any longer. They need to overcome her  fear and his desperation, quickly! Savannah eventually realizes her own  power and worth in the fact that Gregori absolutely NEEDS her to survive.  Meanwhile, Savannah slowly draws him back into the world of, emotions,  colors, humans, laughter, and life! Another fabulous book!<br />Isn't it  extraordinary that an author can write four such outstanding books without  losing any intensity! They are each incredible, and so is Christine Feehan.  I sincerely hope the next book arrives soon, and that it's about Julian. I  can't wait!	2000-07-17

It was a dream she shared with her dying mother. Now Ari is ready to face her domineering father for a chance to go. Unbeknownst to her, her  father has arranged for a special mercenary to guide and protect her. Rafe  Antonio is a wonderful hero. He is tall, strong, honorable, protective,  handsome, intelligent...have I forgotten anything?  He sounds almost to  perfect to like and yet he is very likeable, compassionate, and lonely.   Arianna, on the other hand, has little self-confidence. She is introverted  and delicate, but also creative, joyful and loving. It takes Rafes strength  and confidence to help Ari find herself. She also has help from Inca, (a  great character from  previous Mckenna stories) who is an extremely  powerful woman. Rafe finds in Ari, someone who feels the same wonder and  joy he does about the Amazon rainforest. There is great emotion between  these two, NOT just lust.  Another terrific story by Lindsay Mckenna!	2000-07-10

Her style is very erotic and sensual and so it was surprising that some of the reviews were so negative about the erotic nature of this  book. It seems that if you are reading a S.J. romance you should expect a  high level of sexual content. That said; I found the book witty, fun, and  of course, STEAMY! The bedroom banter between Jack and Venus was terrific.  I liked that they kept their relationship together throughout all the  obstacles thrown their way. No tantrums, or running away, or big  miscommunications. They dealt with everything with humor and wit (and a  trip to bed!). It was refreshing to have them take so long to fall in love  (it would have been unrealistic otherwise), and a little longer to figure  it out. Great characters, and a really fun story!	2000-07-08

Seth was an egotistical jerk! He kept talking to himself about his looks, brains, women, what a great catch he was...YECH! Prudence was a bumbling priss. Shown as klutzy and  scattered, she is also an R.N. and a single mother. (Not very inspiring!)  Her only redeeming quality was she became an ice princess around Dr.  Revolting. I hoped Prudence would deck him and tell him to get lost. I sure  didn't want to see her give in or fall for him.

Liana is a simple American teacher who has drawn the attention of Crown Prince Malik Khan. Naturally, this is unnerving for her. She understandably finds Prince Malik compelling, but she can't see  why he would be interested in her at all. It is very realistic that she  continues to have these doubts for quite a while in the story. An average  american woman is going to question why she's with a future King, and is  not going to just accept it  within 2-3 pages. Malik is quite interesting  himself. He has been trained since he was 4yrs old to be king. He feels the  resposibility and honor of his people very deeply. However, he will not  allow softer personal emotions to touch him, especially after the disaster  of his first marriage. In fact, until he meets Liana he is willing to  accept an arranged marriage. BUT, he does meet Liana and what follows is a  touching and extremely romantic story.	2000-07-02

Quinn Delaney is a security expert assigned to watch over her but not bring  her back until she has a chance at an adventure. What follows is the most  hilarious and enjoyable few weeks in East Wapaneken anyone can imagine. I  laughed out loud many times especially at Jeremy (the significant other to  Shelbys brother Somerton). <br />Quinn was great! Smart, protective, hansome,  and  more snobbish AGAINST rich people than Shelby was AS a rich person.  Shelby was charming, naive, and stronger than she knew. It was a riot  watching her take a bus, shop at T J Maxx, find a job, work a cash  register....etc. The romance between these two was terrific as it grew more  and more as they got to know each other. It was amusing to watch them try  to hide their real identities, both afraid of ruining the relationship.  <br />A fun, witty, touching story!  Very entertaining and HIGHLY recommended!

Another absolute winner in the &quot;Dark&quot; series (the others being; Dark Prince, Dark Gold, and soon Dark Magic). The stories of these Carpathian males and their seach for their &quot;lifemates&quot; are  captivating! In this story, Jacques is drugged, tortured and buried alive.

It really moved me! That two such wounded and lonely people as Michael and Anne should find each other was extraordinary. And Gabriel! Oh  MY! I certainly hope he gets his story told soon. These people were  rejected, used, and damaged and yet still wanted to believe in compassion  (and passion), redemption and love. The sex and the abuse are very  explicit, and certainly not for everyone. However, if you are looking for a  deeper level of love, sex, evil, and redemption, this story is a marvel.

Emma has been asleep for 1000 yrs and  Nora was his lawyer for 1 day and he doesn't see her again for 10 yrs. Nora  has a lawyer-sharp mind with a fantasy-believing personality that I just  couldn't buy.

This story is terrific. <br />Lady Emmalyn has been taking care  of herself and Fallonmour for the 3yrs her husband has been away on  crusade. Sir Cabal has been taking care of himself all his life. Cabal is  the cold, hard, determined warrior called Blackheart. These 2 strong people  are thrown together thru circumstance; Lord Garretts death on crusade, King  Richards trust in Sir Cabal, and the threat from Prince John and Lord Hugh.  Slowly an uneasy truce forms as Emmalyn and Cabal realize they both care  very much for Fallonmour and its people,(and for each other!) Trusting any  man is frightening for Emmalyn after her sham of a marriage. But she is  forced to trust Sir Cabal with her own protection as well as Fallonmours.  Sir Cabal has no concept of love or compassion until Emmalyn shows him his  need for those things. They are a very compelling duo.

However, the book is fast-paced and  entertaining. I liked Kitty and Max but I would have liked to know more  about them. How did Max develope his skills and became the 'Tiger'? Why did  Kitty take up aviation and how did she get started? How did she afford it?   The story doesn't answer alot of questions.

I had trouble getting past this especially when he didn't improve much. He just went on to arrogant and demanding. Tessa swung from pale and weak, to snapping shrew. How she thought she could marry an Earl and not be  recognized, I don't understand. All in all, neither character was very  engaging. The story was flat and meandering. The most interesting aspect  was the character of Lord Kim Farrell. At least he had some personality. He  was also more of a hero than Reave, by helping Tessa when he could have  taken advantage of her. <br />As a whole, the book is &quot;fair&quot;.

The story was weak but the characters were interesting. Wulf and Mili had a very unpleasant meeting as children and neither wanted to marry the other. The best thing about the book is how  they gradually came to know each other as adults, and found out they could  like and respect each other. Slowly their romance built in a much more  realistic fashion then you normally see. The rest of the book is pretty  standard, with even the villain(s) not causing much excitement or worry.  <br />For Lindsey fans out there, there is no way you're going to pass on one  of her books.(Just as I didn't) But know that she has definitely written  better. Let's look forward to 'The Heir' shall we!	2000-04-25

There is so much going on in this book, you are at the end before you realize it. Challen and Tedra are strong, stubborn and so very good together. Challen is a dream! Who wouldn't want a gorgeous, 7 foot, warrior/lover!   Tedra is  self-confident and feisty. The story is funny, tender, and bold...just like  the characters. I LOVE this book, and have read it 5-6 times. You WON'T  be  disappointed! GREAT!   KCS	2000-04-24
US	52086377	R1NBHDVNXX5F88	0821769820	244919481	The Lady's Tutor	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Very good	Let me say right off that I liked this book very much. However, there were many annoying points in the story. First, when a woman hasn't had sex with her husband in 12 yrs, how can she not realize this is a problem. In addition, how can she act upset when he takes a &quot;mistress&quot;. How  can she not see what a heartless man she's married to, and a corrupted  family she comes from. It's like she's had blinders on for 33 yrs and in 2  weeks Ramiel opens her eyes. The strange thing is I ended up liking  Elizabeth very much. She fights for the things she thinks are important.  First to win back her husband (until she realizes he's not worth it), then  fighting for her sons, and of course fighting for Ramiel's heart. <br />Most  of the reviews for this book seem concerned about it's erotic nature. If  you are supposed to be teaching someone about sex and passion, you're  pretty much going to have to talk about sex and passion. Many of the scenes  are explicit, but more in a clinical way rather than a carnal way. However,  it is very sexual...so be forewarned. <br />The pace of the story was fast,  and the secrets of each person was uncovered in a layer by layer way that  was very intriguing. This is a brisk and bold book with characters that  engage you thoroughly. If you want something enjoyable and daring, this is  it!  KCS	2000-04-24

It was refreshing to have the heroine know what she wanted and go after it. Ram knew what he wanted too, but was trapped in  circumstances beyond his control. Both characters were very engaging. My  only disappointment was in Sierra's reunion with her siblings. After all  the years and all the hardships to reach them, not much of a relationship  was developed between them. <br />Connie Mason can always be counted on for an  enjoyable read.  KCS	2000-04-22

This is definitely NOT one of her best. There were entirely to many contrived obstacles in this story. Many if the situations would have made good stories themselves  if they had been developed. But instead we just kept jumping from one  disaster or misunderstanding to another. Pick another Mason book and you  will be more satisfied.	2000-04-22

And they both were determined to do the most ridiculous things. In the house where her mother had been killed (20 yrs ago), her things were ransacked, and our heros were  shot at on the porch, she still tells Samuel its ok to leave her alone  there all day! Even I can hear the creepy music playing. The romance  between them was very tepid in my opinion, and they seemed to share more of  a common goal rather than any real passion. Even the &quot;mystery&quot;   of the murder is given away very early and in an obvious way. Not horrible  but I would take a pass on this one.	2000-04-22

She was tedious, naive, and ill-mannered. Boy, did I grow to like her! She grew so much throughout the story. Lord Brian  was equally complex as the tormented hero. He was so large and strong and  compelling, and yet so unwilling to accept his affliction. <br /> The pacing  of the story was a bit uneven. It would move along nicely and then slow  down. Also the additional characters were rather flat. The scandalous  Countess, the society matron, the harridan mother(Nichola's), the concerned  brother, they could have been more developed. I did like Lord Wallingford  though, he was really quite sweet and made me laugh.<br />Lord Brian and  Nichola were great characters and belonged with each other. Good thing they  found each other isn't it!   KCS	2000-04-22
US	52086377	R1IE3T8DWUFC5T	0505523647	770728227	Once A Pirate	Books	4	12	12	N	N	Very good	This is one of the best time-travel stories I have read. I found the means by which Carly travels thru time much more realistic than the usual amulet or spell. She was a very independent and modern woman, and that made for  some very funny situations with Andrew. Our hero is ALL pirate! My only  disappointment was how long it took them to get together after Andrew  realized Carly was not Amanda. The end of this book is terrific, and has a  unique resolution to the story. If you like time-travel, this is a  wonderful one. KCS	2000-04-22

Faith and Eric were wonderfully complex and full characters. Their struggles and triumphs made their personalities (and the story) so much richer. The relationship between Eric, Colin, and Borg was a great addition as well. I was intrigued  by all three of these  men. Faith was the only well developed female character, but she was so  brave and courageous it was enough. Bridget was a sweet but stereotypical  maid, and Lady Terra was the cruel step-mother. However, it is Eric and  Faiths relationship that is spellbinding! These two people are so perfect  for each other. It is quite touching. <br />I was so surprised to learn that  the next book in this series is totally unrelated. I am so disapointed, I  want to know what happens next.  Ms. Fletcher....PLEASE!

The characters Ian and Felicity were complex and witty and therefore very interesting! Ian was such a mystery, and not like the normal arrogant rake. Felicity was much simpler, she was just trying to  hold her family together no matter the cost. I really liked that about her.  They both had issues from the past which shaped them, but didn't weight  down the story. The chemistry between them ignited right from the start.  They were both passionate people and were well matched. I liked them both  very much and this book was highly enjoyable!	2000-04-20

Dora was so capable and intelligent in all areas BUT love! She was hilarious in her cluelessness about romance. Prince Khalil was just as funny in his &quot;I am the Prince, you should be happy  to be with me&quot; mode. It was great to watch him unbend without even  realizing it. Both of them found something in each other they didn't even  know they were looking for. A sweet romance...and I can't wait to find out  what happens to the other brothers!	2000-04-20

This is an enjoyable read but not an exceptional one. I didn't like that  Maggie never told Nick that Drew was his son. Nick found out another way.  Also it's annoying when Maggie keeps trying to give up a guy as great as  Nick! KEEP him I say!<br /> These few picky items aside, the characters were  entertaining and seemed truly in love, not just lust. Definitely  recommended if you need a quick romance fix. KCS	2000-04-19

Lucien's hardness toward his own family is not that well explained,  and there seems to be some mystery hinted at about his cousin James that  never materializes. Alexandra spends most of the book pushing Lucien away.  Then it seems she DECIDES she's in love with him instead of really FALLING  in love with him because she still keeps refusing him. Frankly, I give  Lucien many points for persistance. <br />I will continue to read future books  by Suzanne Enoch because this is not a bad book, I just have come to expect  more from her stories.

Voluptuous with a sexy voice etc...  but so much of a deal was made about &quot;how could he be with her&quot; that it was  distracting. I LOVE the idea of a heroine who is not model thin, but both  Layla and Ethan seemed to have trouble with it for a while. I really liked  how they had other things in their lives, interesting jobs, sailing,  biking...they were interesting characters. But dump the friend Bill!  What  a jerk. I'd like to see more books with larger woman as heroines. This is a  nice start, but I'd like to see their size be an issue to address not an  overwhelming obstacle....then again I'd like to see that in real life!	2000-04-17

SEXY, strong, intelligent, witty....and a Familiar! We learn so much more about their race in this book and it's all interesting and unique. Jenise is a much better match for Gian than the previous match of  Lilac and Rejar in &quot;Rejar&quot;. Dara Joys books just keep getting  better and better. I hope to see Traed's story SOON, and I would also like  to know what becomes of Dariq.<br /> The books in this series can stand alone,  but do yourself a favor and read them in order. We learn more about the  origins of the different races and characters in each book. Its great to be  reconnected to all these characters and visit them again.<br />These books are  wonderful and captivating, especially &quot;Mine to Take&quot;. You won't  be disappointed!

Although &quot;Rejar&quot; isn't my favorite, it is still terrific. The love scenes were really interesting and hot! Rejar is a fabulous hero. My only dislike  was I couldn't figure out what he saw in Lilac. She was rather boring  actually. There never seemed to be a reason for someone like him to fall  for her. Also, I really enjoyed the different locations and additional  characters that the other books in this series had, but this one didn't  have that. The whole story was locked into Regency England. I thought it  was appropriate however that aliens weren't mentioned much. The  explainations leaned more toward magic and wizards. That seems in keeping  with the time period.<br /> As a male Familiar Rejar is a SEXY and unique  character. I loved learning more about Familiars in &quot;Mine to  Take&quot; (my favorite). Dara Joy seems to just keep getting better. Now  for Traed's story. Hurry, please! You don't want to miss ANY of the books  in this series. They are all extremely enjoyable. Indulge!	2000-04-15

This book was SOOO entertaining and witty and funny and SEXY, I couldn't put it down. I have read all the &quot;Matrix of Destiny&quot; books (this one plus &quot;Rejar&quot; &amp; &quot;Mine to Take&quot;) many times. Dara  Joy has become one of my favorite authors. Her characters are larger than  life, (how can they not be when they are traveling thoughout the galaxy and  into other dimensions) and yet so driven by their convictions and growing  love for each other that you can't help being drawn to them. I can't wait  for the next one! Please let it be Traed's story! If you are looking for an  enjoyable and original read, this is it. Don't miss out!	2000-04-14

There seemed to be alot of deception/misunderstanding between the characters and though they didn't trust each other they kept  forgiving each other. That seemed rather odd. Still it moved along nicely  and the hero was one you'd want to spend a weekend with at a B&amp;B!	2000-04-14
