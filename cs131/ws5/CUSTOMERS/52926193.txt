US	52926193	R3E3RC0N4TF66A	0195179862	359378253	A Brief History of the Paradox: Philosophy and the Labyrinths of the Mind	Books	3	29	32	N	N	Most paradoxes aren't	This survey by a Dartmouth Professor of Philosophy promises \\"a narrative history of paradoxes [extending] from the ancient Greeks ... and into the twentieth century.\\" Although a small-format book, it's a bulky one, using its 370 pages to comprise 24 chronologically-ordered chapters. Each chapter pivots around one philosopher and a paradox associated with that thinker. Examples are: \\"Aristotle on Fatalism\\", \\"Aquinas: Can God Have a Biography\\", and \\"The Common Sense of Thomas Reid\\". Author Roy Sorenson writes with a smooth but playful authority, conveying an encyclopedic grasp of the somewhat cloudy subject matter.<br /><br />The book begins with \\"Anaximander and the Riddle of Origin\\". Author Sorenson states therein that \\"I take paradoxes to be a species of riddle.\\" Here and elsewhere he hints that he is developing for us a taxonomy of paradoxes, but he never fulfills this promise in any explicit fashion. (Only in the final chapter, when the author quotes W. V. O. Quine as defining a paradox as \\"just any conclusion that sounds absurd but that has an argument to sustain it\\", do we have a definition most of us could identify and work with.) The same holds true for explanation or resolution of most of the paradoxes he covers. Seldom does the author present a clear explication of how to resolve out the paradox under discussion.<br /><br />At the same time, he treats almost all with a significance they may -- but too often do not -- deserve. In presenting Parmenides' belief that \\"there is only one thing\\", Sorenson discusses the origins, implications, and stubborn persistence of this contention with erudition but also with some subtle lack of clarity.  Later when the author (finally) enlists the rejoinder that the truth of Parmenides' contention depends on the inherent ambiguity in a cognate of the verb \\"to be\\", the reader may feel that too much has been wasted before admitting the superficiality of this non-paradox.<br /><br />In fact, after following the author through a number of these paradoxes easily resolved by revealing their semantic underpinnings, the reader may feel that this book's primary goal is to convince us that Wittengenstein was right in warning that \\"Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.\\"<br /><br />Despite the rigor of the book's organizational structure, the discussions themselves are elusive and elliptical, but usually entertaining and sometimes thought-provoking. For this reader, most of \\"A Brief History of the Paradox\\" disappointed as a solid treatment of its subject matter. It gained strength though as it left behind the semantic games only posing as paradoxes, and took up thinkers like Russell, Wittengenstein, and Quine who strove to find the true \\"depth\\" in such questions. But perhaps we should keep in mind another Wittengenstein quote (cited by Sorenson): \\"A serious and good philosophical work could be written consisting entirely of jokes.\\"ough a number of these paradoxes easily resolved by revealing their semantic underpinnings, the reader may feel that this book's primary goal is to convince us that Wittengenstein was right in warning that \\"Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.\\"  <br /> <br />Despite the rigor of the book's organizational structure, the discussions themselves are elusive and elliptical, but usually entertaining and sometimes thought-provoking.

But it takes a real effort and dedication to get through it. It would be unfortunate if the book's faults caused its significance to be buried.<br /><br />A summary here would be neither necessary (see other reviews) nor adequate. But where \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" was about as well-honed as a 3000-year survey could be, \\"Collapse\\" is often baggy and self-indulgent. The author's penchant for list-making is given free rein. The overuse of the first-person makes you suspect a personal agenda or two of being at play. (Diamond admits that he has chosen the first and last chapters of his case studies not because that arch best illustrates his theme, but because he loved Montana as a teenager and now, late in life, has come to love Australia.) The two chapters on Greenland are repetitive. The effect is frequently wearisome, and I have to admit to skipping over the last part of many of the lists as well as the last part of the book itself.<br /><br />That is, I suspect, my loss. Chunks of insight are embedded everywhere in \\"Collapse\\" and I probably missed another handful in the 20 or so pages I merely skimmed. Take the author's description of the comparative economics of oil and \\"hard-rock\\" mining: that's one of the best examples of how Diamond can deftly sketch the intricacies of a system while making it seem newly accessible to understanding.<br /><br />At its best, as it frequently is, \\"Collapse\\" gives us a new frame of reference for trying to make sense of what's happening in the world. But prepare yourself for a slog through some parts.	2005-03-11

Here's a comparative review of each, which I'm posting for each work.<br /><br />1. Translation by G.C. Macaulay and revised throughout by Donald Lateiner; published by Barnes and Noble Classics in 2004, but the Macaulay translation is from around 1890.<br /><br />I started with this one, attracted by the extensive introduction by Donald Lateiner. That intro was solid and revealed much that I hadn't been aware of. But the translation, even after Lateiner's revisions, is awkward and stilted. Many of the pronoun references are confusing, making it difficult to follow the narrative thread.<br /><br />Here's about half of a single sentence: \\"Now Miltiades son of Kimon had thus taken possession of Lemnos:--After the Pelasgians had been cast out of Attica by the Athenians, whether justly or unjustly,--for about this I cannot tell except the things reported, which are these:--Hecataios on the one hand, the son of Hegesander, said in his history that it was done unjustly: for he said that when the Athenians saw the land which extends below Hymettos, which they had themselves given them to dwell in, as payment for the wall built round the Acropolis in former times, when the Athenians, I say, saw that the land was made good by cultivation, which before was bad or worthless, they were seized with jealousy and with longing to possess the land, and so drove them out, not alleging any other pretext: ...\\"<br /><br />The footnotes are generally helpful, although many only state the obvious. They are all integrated with the text, making it unnecessary to keep paging to the back. The text is followed by some interesting additions: A \\"Repertory\\" of English translations, a list of comments and works \\"inspired\\" by Herodotus, further \\"comments and questions\\", an extensive bibliography, and two good Indices with that of proper names separate from the general index.<br /><br />Maps: There are eight, all of which appear to be from the original Macaulay publication. In any case, they do not appear to be based on the most recent cartography. The first, more extensive maps are helpful, but, to my mind, the others are crudely drawn and lack important detail.  Still, I'd give this edition a good rating for maps, since it turns out that eight is a comparatively generous serving.<br /><br />2. Translation by Aubrey de Selincourt in 1954; revised by John Marincola in 1972, 1996, and 2003; published by Penguin Classics.<br /><br />Disappointed by the Macaulay/Lateiner translation, I picked this one up on the basis of the strong reputation of Penguin Classics. It has another good introduction, followed by a limited bibliography. The translation itself is much easier to digest.<br /><br />Here's how it renders the same passage as above: \\"The events which led to Miltiades' capture of Lemnos were as follows. The Athenians had forced certain Pelasgians to leave Attica. Whether or not they were justified in doing this is not clear; all I can offer are the two contradictory accounts, that of the Athenians themselves, on the one side, and of Hecataeus the son of Hegesander on the other. Hecataeus in his History maintains that the Athenians were in the wrong. According to him, they had given the Pelasgians in payment for building the wall round the Acropolis a tract of land, of poor quality and in bad condition, at the foot of Mt Hymettus; the Pelasgians had improved the land, and when the Athenians saw it changed out of recognition and in first-rate order, they grudged the gift and longed to take it back, until without further justification they forcibly ejected the occupants.\\"<br /><br />The footnotes, which are more extensive and informative than Lateiner's, are unfortunately all gathered as endnotes, necessitating frequent paging back and forth. There's a brief Glossary, which is far from adequate. A decent Index closes the edition.<br /><br />Maps: There are only four, gathered together at the front. None of the battle sites are represented. The maps are well-drawn, but sacrifice detail for clarity. This was this edition's weakest aspect. It also lacks the many extras provided by Lateiner.<br /><br />3. Translation by David Grene; published by the University of Chicago Press, 1987<br /><br />A friend who owns a used book store provided this in time for the last 2 books of The History. There's a long Introduction, with a deeper focus than the others. Grene says this about his translation: \\"The English in which Herodotus comes before us should be direct, powerful, and clear but also, I think, a little odd.\\" I found this to be a worthy approach and one which Grene achieves in practice, with little loss of clarity.<br /><br />Here's that same passage: \\"Now this is the story of how Miltiades took Lemnos. The Pelasgians had been driven out of Attica by the Athenians--whether justly or otherwise I cannot say, only that Hecataeus, son of Hegisander, mentions it in his account and says that it was unjustly; for, he says, the Athenians had given the Pelasgians a piece of land to live in, under Hymettus, in payment for the wall that was at one time drawn around the Acropolis; and when the Athenians saw this place, which had before been very poor and worthless, now well tilled, they were seized with envy and longing to possess it and drove the Pelasgians out, urging no other pretext against them.\\"<br /><br />Grene has both footnotes and endnotes, the latter being longer and applicable to whole sections. There is a good Index that also attempts to provide explanatory material. That was a good idea, but it's applied somewhat randomly and was thus more frustrating than helpful.<br /><br />Maps: There are 4 maps at the end and an additional 4 within the text. Of the 3 editions, this is the only one to include a map of Xerxes' route, but it has a major error. It also has the best map of Ionia.<br /><br />I'd recommend Grene on the strength of his translation. But Lateiner has the best additional material. None of the three has sufficient maps for anyone who, like I, gets hung up on the many unfamiliar place names in Herodotus. You'll need a companion book for a better understanding of the geography; I haven't found an ideal solution, but both Wars of the Ancient Greeks by Victor Davis Hanson and The Penguin Historical Atlas of Ancient Greece were helpful.dex closes the edition. <br /> <br />Maps: There are only four, gathered together at the front.

Here's a comparative review of each, which I'm posting for each work.<br /><br />1. Translation by G.C. Macaulay and revised throughout by Donald Lateiner; published by Barnes and Noble Classics in 2004, but the Macaulay translation is from around 1890.<br /><br />I started with this one, attracted by the extensive introduction by Donald Lateiner. That intro was solid and revealed much that I hadn't been aware of. But the translation, even after Lateiner's revisions, is awkward and stilted. Many of the pronoun references are confusing, making it difficult to follow the narrative thread.<br /><br />Here's about half of a single sentence: \\"Now Miltiades son of Kimon had thus taken possession of Lemnos:--After the Pelasgians had been cast out of Attica by the Athenians, whether justly or unjustly,--for about this I cannot tell except the things reported, which are these:--Hecataios on the one hand, the son of Hegesander, said in his history that it was done unjustly: for he said that when the Athenians saw the land which extends below Hymettos, which they had themselves given them to dwell in, as payment for the wall built round the Acropolis in former times, when the Athenians, I say, saw that the land was made good by cultivation, which before was bad or worthless, they were seized with jealousy and with longing to possess the land, and so drove them out, not alleging any other pretext: ...\\"<br /><br />The footnotes are generally helpful, although many only state the obvious. They are all integrated with the text, making it unnecessary to keep paging to the back. The text is followed by some interesting additions: A \\"Repertory\\" of English translations, a list of comments and works \\"inspired\\" by Herodotus, further \\"comments and questions\\", an extensive bibliography, and two good Indices with that of proper names separate from the general index.<br /><br />Maps: There are eight, all of which appear to be from the original Macaulay publication.

Jack Rummel's account of Frida Kahlo's life is instead a nuanced one, with an obstinate refusal to over-simplify. Rummel makes clear that Kahlo was neither saint nor passive victim, but instead a visionary artist compromised by an acute capacity for self-deception.<br /><br />The convoluted paths of Kahlo's life are brought into sharp focus by Rummel's concise but illuminating narrative. Whether treating of Kahlo's finances or the intricacies of her art, the author knows how to turn the basic facts into a convincing story.<br /><br />Only the most deranged and prejudiced reader could dismiss Rummel's book on the withered grounds that it doesn't conform to some political agenda. Instead, this thin volume is packed with the suitable complexity of an uncategorizable life.	2004-12-14

As Rothfeder guides us through Rapid City (Iowa), the Narmada River in India, the ill-fated village of Cochabamba in Bolivia, and many other water mismanagement sites, he proves to be an effective and moving chronicler. The power of his book lies in his ability to combine a big picture view with attention to the lives of the powerless who happen to be downstream from some megalomaniac water project.<br /><br />Cochabamba proves to be both the most arresting and yet ironically one of the more promising of Rothfeder's accounts. Townspeople were first subjected to the loss of their major industry, tin mining. That loss of local revenue then led to the deterioration of their water distribution system. The Bolivian government tried to rescue the situation by privatizing the town's water management out to Bechtel, which promptly raised water fees. Something approaching civil war resulted. Instead of simply bemoaning the path taken, Rothfeder sees in the eventual outcome (after destruction, arrests, and deaths, the government cancelled its deal with Bechtel) both a salutary object lesson and a hope that, with a newly recognized need for safeguards, privatization can in fact be a critical part of addressing the world's accelerating water crisis.<br /><br />Giving validity to this optimistic outlook, the author concludes that same chapter with a look at how the Blair government turned the UK's privatization efforts, begun disastrously under Margaret Thatcher, into a successful model for the rest for the world.

Washington's attitude toward the American West. It illustrates the author's ability to turn a felicitous phrase as well as the General's and his compatriots' engineering frame of mind.<br /><br />The geography of the Potomac River, Washington's plans for it as the sinew that would tie a new nation together, and how those plans did or did not come to fruition are the interconnected themes of this account. For Achenbach, the Potomac is a narrative mainstream with many anecdotal tributaries. The author propels the stories with an undertow of irony and an unwillingness to treat Washington with the usual reverence.<br /><br />The book begins with, and is dominated by, a chronicle of the general's westward reconnaissance mission in 1784. It was on this trip, generally along the path of the Potomac and often times on the river itself, that Washington began to concretize his plans for establishing such a route as the way trade would be established with the Ohio valley, with both economic and political benefits to follow. The Potomac was not a waterway that allowed for effortless navigation. It would of course require some engineering.<br /><br />Following that compelling beginning, Achenbach pilots us down the river's story, relating it to Washington's presidency, the establishment of Washington City as the capital, the War of 1812, the Civil War, and the modern economic development of the region. Through all these events, the alteration of the river continued. As interestingly as Achenbach formulates each account, none ever seems as well-integrated as that of the 1784 trip.<br /><br />Along the way, we read with varying interest of Washington's legal battle with settlers on what he considered his western possessions, his fear of being buried alive, and the etymology of \\"turnpike\\".<br /><br />Although not as polemical, you might consider this the Eastern equivalent of \\"Cadillac Desert\\" in its recounting of American unwillingness to accept the land as it was found, as long as government could be compelled to subsidize its transformation. To only slightly paraphrase that earlier book: confronted by new land, the first thing Americans want to do is change it.<br /><br />The later chapters may not match the standard established by the first few. But overall, \\"Grand Idea\\" is an absorbing, well-written geographical history.e\\".  <br /> <br />Although not as polemical, you might consider this the Eastern equivalent of \\"Cadillac Desert\\" in its recounting of American unwillingness to accept the land as it was found, as long as government could be compelled to subsidize its transformation.

Hayes, Samuel Tilden, and the Stolen Election of 1876	Books	3	13	16	N	N	&quot;Was there a Compromise of 1877?&quot; -- revisited	If you're looking for a fresh account of the 1876 presidential election that will provide the relevant background, relate the principal facts, and describe the roles of the various players in the drama, Roy Morris' book will do fine. (His vivid retelling of the actual &quot;counting&quot; of the Electoral College votes would by itself recommend the book to such a reader.) If instead you are seeking an in-depth, defensible interpretation of the events, one that will make use of the latest scholarship, then I feel &quot;Fraud of the Century&quot; falls short.<br /><br /> Author Roy Morris, Jr. relies heavily on cliches in his recounting of the campaign, election, and aftermath. Pejorative terms and expressions such as scalawag, carpetbagger, and &quot;waving the bloody shirt&quot; abound, used by Morris without reservation or even definition. The &quot;bloody shirt&quot; characterization is applied whenever he tells of a speech defending black voting rights in the South. Overall, the impression builds that Morris' sympathies are distinctly on the side of those who sought to restore the pre-war power balance in the Confederate states. While forthrightly condemning the means -- thus the &quot;stolen election&quot; of the subtitle -- he nevertheless sees the result as a necessary and inevitable restoration of &quot;home rule&quot;. His treatment of the various Reconstruction state governments -- particularly that in Mississippi under the estimable Adelbert Ames -- fails to properly recognize the validity of what those regimes were trying to accomplish. Instances of fraud, incompetence, and the use of force in those Reconstruction governments are presented as if they were defining and unique characteristics, rather than attributes at least equally found in the preceding and succeeding white regimes. And by and large he accepts the self-serving accounts in Hayes' diary as truth, while always casting aspersions on the motives of the Radical Republicans.<br /><br /> Was there was an explicit quid-pro-quo that motivated Southern Democrats to acquiesce in the reversal of the actual results and to give the presidency to the Republican Hayes? This question has been a significant one in the historiography of the period and has been framed in part as &quot;Was there a Compromise of 1877?&quot; Morris seems to conclusively build the case that there was such an arrangement and then surprisingly to write that the resolution of the electoral crisis &quot;did not depend on any secret deals.&quot;<br /><br /> This could possibly be read as a nuanced view that pivots on what actually constitutes a &quot;secret deal.&quot; Or that there was such a deal, but that delivery of the presidency was only the occasion for it and not actually an element in the deal. But to this reader, Morris' interpretation seems to be simply that, since the &quot;understandings&quot; were never embodied in a written contract, and since Hayes managed to retain deniability of any such deal, one therefore did not exist. This seems to me to be a naive view, and the events Morris relates argue against it.<br /><br /> Overall, the author accepts the interpretation of Reconstruction -- and thus the merits of its demise -- that dominated both scholarly works and textbooks in various forms for over a hundred years. Generally, that view claimed that the end of Radical Republican governments in the South &quot;marked the end of force as an element in American political life and a return to the ways of conciliation&quot; (Randall and Donald). That view has recently been effectively challenged by works such as the well-documented &quot;Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory&quot; by David Blight. Although Morris cites that work in his bibliography, he seems to have ignored its uncovering of how our collective perception of Reconstruction had been warped by the need to reintegrate the (white) South back into the Union.<br /><br /> Putting aside this somewhat stale interpretation and the effect it seemingly has on the way Morris characterizes many events, his book otherwise serves as a compelling look at the circumstances that produced a turning point in American history.as on the way Morris characterizes many events, his book otherwise serves as a compelling look at the circumstances that produced a turning point in American history.	2004-07-19

We have certain expectations. We'll learn something about the people and their customs. The scenery and landscape will be revealed as novel and inspiring. The region's history will be uncovered. Or perhaps the book will be filled with adventures and mishaps that make for good story-telling.<br />&quot;In the Empire of Genghis Khan&quot; is made up all those elements, and author Stanley Stewart handles most of them especially well. Others, not so well.<br />Stewart begins with a crossing from Istanbul to the western edge of Mongolia on slightly modern conveyances. He intends to roughly follow the path of a 13th century missionary, Friar William of Rubruck. These first legs of the journey are indeed characterized by situations and characters whose portrayals remind a reader of a Joseph Conrad novel.<br />Once in Mongolia, Stewart saddles up his first horse. He uses the Friar's account as a foil for contrasting with his own 20th century encounters. But the author is most successful when describing the Mongolian countryside, which has changed little from that earlier exploration. In this Stewart's language is evocative and crisp, capable of creating a truly unique atmospheric texture.<br />Otherwise, Stewart writes in a slight but persistent mocking tone. This sardonic tinge spares only the landscape, the occasional attractive woman, and the author's own thoughts. Mongolian customs and most Mongolians are treated with more than a trace of condescension. Even Mongolian hospitality which seems to the reader engaging and unfailing is treated with subtle derision. And Stewart proves to be an equal-opportunity derider, mocking Russians in a way that calls up the usual stereotypes. Some of this Stewart pulls off in humorous fashion. But the incessant mockery leaves the reader questioning the author's ability to truly appreciate a different way of life. It's an odd weakness - or choice - for a serial traveler.<br />As he recounts his journey, Stewart educates us on Mongolian history. The Genghis Kahn story is integrated with the travelogue in effective fashion. As for more recent history, the author provides only the minimally requisite facts until near the end. Then in the penultimate chapter he unloads the details of the Soviet occupation and eventual withdrawal in somewhat textbook fashion. Although fascinating enough in its interplay with aspects of Mongolian character, the chapter seems perfunctory and of little real interest to Stewart.<br />But these failures of nuance are continually redeemed by Stewart's descriptions when actually on horseback, seemingly alone with the elements. Here Stewart seems to have an inexhaustible supply of on-target metaphors. Crystalline sentences convey a real sense of why travel to new reaches is always compelling, even when vicarious.ing the author's ability to truly appreciate a different way of life.

All take place during the Chicago World?s Fair ? or the Columbian Exposition ? of 1893. One narrative deals with the Fair itself: its genesis, design, construction, 6-month operation, and fate. Author Erik Larson centers his account of the Fair on its Director of Works (i.e. ?Chief of Everything?), architect Daniel Burnham. The author?s second narrative is about the first man to be termed a ?psychopath?, serial killer Dr. H.H. Holmes. Holmes did his deeds largely during the Fair?s run-up and run, at a site near the fairgrounds.<br /><br />These two stories dominate, and during most of the book Larson advances them in alternating chapters. Later Larson adds a third, small strand into his narrative mesh. That concerns Patrick Prendergast, a man totally out of touch with reality and who diverts the planned ending of the fair from a celebration to a dirge.<br /><br />For the first half of the book, Dr. Holmes? story proves to be the more absorbing. The facts are simply more interesting and more grippingly presented than the Burnham biography. But at about that point, the balance shifts. Once the Fair nears reality, its details become irresistibly fascinating. Simultaneously, Larson?s piling up of gruesome minutiae about the doctor?s crime spree becomes surprisingly tedious. At the Fair, visitors are reduced to tears by the coherent magnificence of the structures; Chicago?s awe-inspiring answer to the Eiffel Tower defies all fears while offering an unprecedented experience; and famous visitors revel in the Fair?s pleasures. Meanwhile, still another young woman is seduced and murdered by Holmes.<br />?Devil in the White City? is a good story ? or stories, depending on how you look at it ? and Larson is an effective writer. I especially valued his ability to convincingly depict the most transfixing scenes from the Fair and his occasional effective sarcasm (such as a paragraph that reads in its entirety: ?That kind of thing.?). But there are some serious annoyances.<br />Least significant of these annoyances is the author?s frequent habit of the ?condescending tease?. In the Prologue, he slyly but obviously alludes to the sinking of the Titanic, but doesn?t identify it until the closing chapter. He baits us with a scene in which all Chicago waits for news, without telling us what news it waited for, even though the book?s subject matter makes it clear. He frequently closes chapters with sentences such as ?Far worse was to occur, and soon.? At least once, in the case of the momentarily famous ?Little Egypt?, he even looses track of the fact that he never provides the resolution to the tease. This habit betrays an author?s unjustified lack of faith in his storytelling powers.<br />Those who develop books about purportedly seminal moments in history feel justifiably compelled to show the age they write about to be in some way exceptional. Thus we get sentences like this one from the book under review: ?Stature [was] a powerful lure in this age when pride of place ranked second only to pride of blood.? In fact, have not all ages shared such a characteristic? Don?t we all hope and claim that our town or city stands out from others ? else why would we have chosen it? Hasn?t competition between New York and Chicago (or Rome and Carthage) always existed?<br />This may seem like a minor point, but I believe it goes to the heart of books such as this. Is it just a good read ? a good story well-told ? or does it illustrate something more profound about the time, locale, and/or people that it describes? Does it teach us something about ourselves, about how we reached our own circumstances, about human characteristics that transcend the particulars? The question of ?transcendence? may not be pertinent to some readers, and others may well perceive such a quality in this book. I shouldn?t belabor the point except to say that I didn?t find that Larson achieved it, despite both his obvious effort and the opportunity presented by late 19th-century Chicago.<br /><br />The book also raises nagging questions about the genre to which it belongs, which I would call ?fictionalized history?. As the stories unfold, the sense builds that there are heavily imagined events where the author first appeared to be dealing with facts. Slowly this sense erodes a part of the book?s power. We become suspicious that any portion might be the product not of history or even of history as best reconstructed, but of the writer?s need to combine otherwise disparate narratives. Only after we have finished does the author, in following Endnotes, admit that he has ?re-created? certain events, and he dares us to reconstruct them more authentically. Not only does his confession fail to cover many obviously imagined sections, the approach undermines even those that we were previously prepared to accept as verifiable.<br /><br />Alternative approaches were available to the author. He could have written separate books. He could have written an authentically historical account. He could have warned us up front that at least one of his accounts was heavily ?re-created.? He could have written a novel (and probably ?Devil in the White City? can be read most satisfactorily as such).<br />The Fair?s story generally survives all this and that alone makes the book worth picking up. It may spur a reader to find out even more about the Columbian Exposition (Larson includes only a few photographs). I trust you?ll never want to read anything more about the horrific Dr. Holmes.it, despite both his obvious effort and the opportunity presented by late 19th-century Chicago.<BR> <BR>The book also raises nagging questions about the genre to which it belongs, which I would call ?fictionalized history?.

It allows the author to make complementary explorations of developments in various areas, be those geographies, cultures, and/or ideas. (John Wills' &quot;1688: A Global History&quot; was a particularly successful example of the genre.) Christopher Lee's book about 1603 - limited mostly to Great Britain - is not so successful.<br />The audience for this book will be largely those already familiar with British history, geography, and current idiom. I thought I had a reasonably good grasp of the genealogy of the British kings and queens leading up to 1603; my grasp loosened considerably after reading Lee's attempt to clarify the lineages. My alienation was reinforced by the frequency of phrases such as &quot;as we know&quot; and &quot;of course&quot; when the author deals with facts that non-British readers are unlikely to know or to treat as a matter of course. (&quot;Lady Jane Grey ... was, of course, Warwick's own daughter-in-law.&quot;) And isn't the author overly fond of the rhetorical question? (Examples abound, such as: &quot;The Jesuits?&quot; and &quot;What of James in all this?&quot;)<br />Lee's main organizing principle is that of proving that 1603 was an important year in history. Although he cites one historian with an opposing view, the question strikes me as neither controversial nor deep. And without that, the text, like the subtitle, proves to be just a stringing together of topics. Some of these topics are compelling, but too many aren't. A chapter on piracy works. One on King James' coronation is interminably dull.<br />There are numerous historical nuggets and oddities to be mined here. But the excavation effort proved too strenuous for this reader.	2004-06-11
US	52926193	R39BLVUJBFWD9I	1594200068	745553598	Free Culture: How Big Media Uses Technology and the Law to Lock Down Culture and Control Creativity	Books	5	15	18	N	N	Is Jack Valenti our most culturally-destructive person?	About halfway through \\"Free Culture\\" author Lawrence Lessig offers his most arresting example among many to illustrate his main arguments. That example - or set of examples - comes from Adobe's eBook Reader. When using this particular piece of software to read a downloaded electronic book, you are given a set of \\"permissions\\". These include how many times you can copy from the book to the clipboard, how many times you are allowed to print selections from the book, and how many times, if any, you can have your device \\"Read Aloud\\" the book. (Other eBook readers have similar characteristics, and Lessig is quick to absolve Adobe of fault.)<br />This represents one case of how technology allows content providers to introduce new restrictions that have no basis in copyright law or practice as it existed until recently. The Adobe eBook Reader allows such providers to limit even \\"fair use\\", or any use, even for books that are not in fact copyrighted. Congress and the courts have however been quick to provide shelter for this increasing control garnered and enforced by content owners. These and other trends lead to Lessig's main point: \\"the Internet should at least force us to rethink the conditions under which the law of copyright automatically applies, because it is clear that the current reach of copyright was never contemplated, much less chosen, by the legislators who enacted copyright law.\\"<br />As evidenced by the preceding quote, Lessig's language is seldom extreme, although the instances he cites and the conclusions he draws are truly alarming. He lays out his case in a methodical, always interesting, and frequently entertaining approach. He begins historically, leading us through the record of how we and the courts have defined \\"property\\" and \\"property rights\\", particularly as they apply to intellectual and cultural property. He demonstrates how, in the U.S., almost every segment of the media industry began with \\"piracy\\" of some sort. He cites how, until now, the decisive judgments by the courts in cases dealing with such \\"piracy\\" have almost always been in support of, ultimately, the \\"free\\" dissemination of culture.<br />Essential to Lessig's story is the specific history of copyright law. In the U.S., the first such law in 1790 established a copyright term of 14 years, allowed for only one renewal (also for 14 years), and required registration. With the passage of the \\"Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act\\" (CTEA) in 1998, we now have an effective term of 95 years, renewal is essentially automatic, and no registration is required. (One of the most compelling sections, although not critical to Lessig's overall narrative, is how he unsuccessfully argued in the Supreme Court against CTEA.)<br />As \\"Free Culture\\" demonstrates, even more effective than recent Congressional action in stifling cultural dissemination have been the efforts of people and groups such as Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The author shows that their favorite weapon is the harassment suit that overwhelms the defendants' fiscal ability to respond. Valenti and the MPAA sued to outlaw VCRs (luckily Sony did have the wherewithal to defend itself). The RIAA sued the Girl Scouts for singing around the campfire. And the two groups combined to spend about $1.5M in lobbying leading up to the passage of the Sony Bono Act.<br />Lessig closes with some very specific and detailed proposals of how we can fight these increasing incursions on the free spread of culture.<br />This is a valuable and necessary book. For the most part, it is lucidly argued and engagingly written. The examples, metaphors, and illustrations are plentiful and right on the mark. The flow of the book has, I think, just two lapses that, while perhaps obscure, may interfere with a reader's ability to follow Lessig's logic at critical junctures.<br />One such lapse is that he does not clearly maintain the distinction between digital, Internet-based technologies for cultural dissemination and those non-digital ones which will live on. His arguments in the first half of the book seem to suggest that he believes that \\"hard-copy\\" media will eventually disappear, or at least that all new works will, at some point, be produced only via electronic means. I doubt if this is precisely how he envisions the future; he needs I think to clarify how he sees the distinction playing out.<br />The second lapse is this. The ability of big media conglomerates to recruit the courts and copyright law to their side is based on a legal determination that, as Lessig puts it,\\"each use of the Internet produces a copy.\\"  He glides over this point without fully explaining how that is so. Since it is so vital to the whole structure of how the law deals with the Internet, and since it will seem counter-intuitive to many, it would have been helpful for the author to have fully explained it and to have done so early in the book.<br />Media conglomerate attacks on music-sharing, campfire-singing, and movie-sampling may seem entirely justified to many. \\"Free Culture\\" sees and presents clearly the kind of constricted cultural future this might well lead to.

Thus I doubt if my own opinion expressed here will have any great generality. I'll post it anyway and apologize in advance for its specificity.<br />This is the third book about science and scientists by Jonathan Weiner that I have read. Based on what I saw as significant evolution in skill in the second (\\"Time, Love, Memory\\"), I had high expectations for this third. The book means to tell two interwoven stories. One is the very specific yet compellingly multi-faceted one of a young man, Stephen Haywood, who contracts an incurable disease (ALS, or \\"Lou Gehrig's disease) and of how his family reacts. The second means to generalize from that by relating it to how genetics, gene therapy, and other radically new treatments are challenging the accepted norms of medical research. This interplay of the particular and the universal is the approach that Weiner seemed to have mastered in his previous work.<br />It is a third narrative that, in my view and as Weiner almost admits, causes this account to go off course. At about the same time that he embarked on this project, the author learns that his mother is also the victim of an incurable neurological disease. As he struggles to come to terms with this devastating diagnosis, he describes how he is inextricably seduced by the efforts of Stephen Haywood's entrepreneurial brother to accelerate the discovery of a revolutionary cure for ALS and perhaps other related disorders.<br />The book radiates sadness from the beginning and you might want to steal yourself, as I did, by resolutely distancing yourself from its subjects. (This was a strategy that was unavailable to Weiner once he learned of his mother's illness.) Before their collision with ALS, the Haywoods were a privileged and blessed family, characterized by charm, intelligence, a prosperity that exceeded most, an excess of good taste, and apparently no notable good works. Weiner strives to convinces us that they are not just charming but also sympathetic and admirable people - \\"grace under pressure\\" is one of his professed themes -but he achieves that only for Stephen.<br />Tolstoy taught us that there is uniqueness in every unhappy family. The Haywood story achieves uniqueness in large part because of Stephen's older brother Jamie. At the beginning of the account, just before Stephen's diagnosis, Jamie is distinguished by two characteristics: he is remarkably tied to his brother and he has happened to have just made his way into the Biotechnology field. Trained and successful as a Mechanical Engineer, his talent and drive have propelled him into more entrepreneurial pursuits. This is 1996, and where better to be an ambitious, driven entrepreneur than in Biotech. He joins the Neurosciences Institute, with the charter to \\"package the think-tank's ideas and turn them into money.\\"  The scientists there believe that their research puts them on the verge of being able to \\"cure the uncurable.\\" It is a time of great hubris, both scientific and economic, and Jamie has found an epicenter.<br />When he learns that his brother has one of those \\"uncurable\\" diseases, Jamie launches his own foundation to find the cure. Weiner traces Jamie's various battles and tries to relate these efforts to the larger story of modern neuroscience. But the author's own reactions increasingly compete for the focus of the story. He too is seeking a cure for an uncurable disease, that of his mother. His objectivity is undermined, and his ability to distinguish hype from reality is incurably compromised.<br />We do get fascinating and tantalizing glimpses into the science, business, and personalities of genetic therapy, but these serve only to make us wish for a more developed treatment. Weiner is a surreptitiously artful writer whose style is usually characterized by paragraphs that are compact but commanding and authoritative. He crafts many of those here, but not to the same effect as in his earlier work. In fact, this book frequently does not seem crafted at all, just avalanched from an emotional precipice. The aspects of the story beyond that of the Haywoods and Weiners are difficult to follow as scientists, researchers, and theories of neurological behavior flicker in and out of the account, and there's no index to help those of us with less than encyclopedic memories.<br />In the closing Acknowledgements, the author says this in thanking his father: \\"[h]e would much rather have kept our own story in the family, and I hope he will feel that the cause was good.\\" This seems to me to be a measure of the both the strength and weakness of \\"His Brother's Keeper.\\" It is obviously a heartfelt work that attempts great personal honesty.

Your friend is obviously well-read, organizes his thoughts effectively, and most importantly knows how to tell a good story. There is of course no time for footnotes and you're too polite to interrupt with questions like &quot;how do you know that?&quot; Oddly, he's come prepared with more than a few fascinating prints apparently of engravings illustrating various events in his story, but he never finds time to tell you where they're from.<br />A pleasant evening ensues and you get an entertaining, panoramic view of the progression of English forays across the Atlantic from the years 1536 through Sir Walter Raleigh's death on the chopping-block in 1618. Although he begins with &quot;let me tell you the story of Big Chief Elizabeth&quot;, the queen herself gets only passing mentions from your friend, and his story lasts well into the reign of James I. When he finishes, you have many questions, but he quickly packs up his engravings, gives you the names of a few books to check out from the library, and departs. You think, maybe I will get those other books.<br />British author Giles Milton begins with the rather comical story of Richard Hore, who financed and led a two-ship adventure to the Labrador coast in 1536. Hore and his compatriots gave no thought beforehand to their route or to how much provisioning they might need for their voyage. Of course, the attempt ends badly. In a foretaste of minor frustrations ahead for the reader, author Milton relates the fate of only one of the ships.<br />A few other faltering attempts to exploit the New World are described, but it's only when Sir Walter Ralegh enters the picture that Milton's story gains its true focus. (Milton chooses the spelling &quot;Ralegh&quot; from among the many alternatives that the courtier himself utilized --- which did not, according to the author, include &quot;Raleigh&quot;.) From hereon, the book could be read as a Ralegh biography.<br />The Ralegh-sponsored Roanoke colony, with its fate still cloaked in mystery, is the most compelling part of this story. Milton's approach is to first recount the known facts in as uncomplicated a way as possible. This proves beneficial, as the many books written specifically to solve the mystery of disappearance have too often made it seem only more impenetrable. (See especially the captivating yet maddening &quot;Roanoke: Solving the Mystery of the Lost Colony&quot; by Lee Miller.)  Later, in a somewhat dogmatic Epilogue, Milton lays out what he believes happened to those colonists. Although he makes only an abbreviated attempt to cite authorities and to prove his case, I found his explanation consistent with the best-established facts and therefore convincing.<br />But before that Epilogue, Milton continues the story with his version of the Jamestown saga, with attendant profiles of John Smith, Powhatan, Pocahontas, and others. This section is workmanlike, adding neither new insights nor detail to this oft-recounted part of colonial history.<br />There are two maps, acceptable in themselves, but leaving unanswered many questions of geographical detail important to the accounts. This shortcoming, the lack of footnotes, and the rudimentary bibliography relegate the book to one of only passing interest.

The novel tells the story of a number of men (and one woman) seeking their fortune and/or deliverance in a rumored or dreamt new environment further west from wherever they began. Blum's selection of his main characters runs just slightly askew of the predictable: a Spanish-American cowboy, two mountain men (one American, the other French-Canadian), an escaped slave, and a coming-of-age girl cast out by her father. All of course have 24-karat hearts.<br />The author provides just enough nuance to keep these characters from becoming stereotypical. Less successfully drawn are subsidiary characters such as the manipulative banker and the evil sheriff. And don't look here (after a half-hearted attempt in the early chapters) for a sophisticated depiction of American Indians. But in this type of novel we expect history to play the major supporting roles, and in this respect Blum doesn't disappoint. The California Gold Rush, the progression of the Santa Fe Trail, and the nature of the New Mexico territory are prominently cast.<br />Blum doesn't necessarily deliver historical accuracy. What he does provide is its cousin -- a sense of believability. He has created a fictional universe that seems internally consistent and artfully rendered. It doesn't completely coincide with the myths of the West on which many of us were raised; instead and more importantly, he gives us a world which seems slightly more complicated and therefore considerably more convincing.<br />But he doesn't do this effortlessly. In his determination to create a novel voice of his own and unique dialects for his characters, the sweat sometimes shows through. Yet, instead of being annoyed, I found myself appreciative of the attempt.<br />As for the plot itself, it struck me as well-paced and adequately complex.

The crossing of the Rubicon may be attractively symbolic, but even here it holds only a few pages of attention. Instead, author Tom Holland covers Roman history from around 146 BC through the reign of Augustus with a decidedly eccentric approach.<br />The story of the Roman Republic maintains such inherent power, resonance, and drama that almost any book on the subject will hold our attention. This proves true here, but Holland seems determined to test that thesis.<br />First, there's a muddled Preface, in which the author states that \\"many statements of fact in this book could plausibly be contradicted by an opposite interpretation.\\" While this proves to be a more than justified warning, it seems to serve primarily as carte blanche for the author to read into his subjects' actions any motivation which appeals to his soap opera mentality. Determined readers might well just skip this part in order to maintain their spirits. We expect historians, even of the non-professional kind, to have objectivity and accuracy as goals. We don't expect them to give up on these ideals before they even begin.<br />This is followed by an introductory chapter entitled \\"The Paradoxical Republic\\". Here Holland interprets every complexity as a \\"paradox.\\"  (Too bad for us that societies don't construct themselves in neater, less intellectually-challenging structures.)<br />Thereafter Holland makes no real attempt to develop this idea of paradox. While covering the main events of the Republic's deterioration, he seems to have no real thesis about its causes. Instead he comes across as preoccupied with belittling the main actors' motivations. He attributes to them - Sulla, Pompey, Caesar - a consistency of purpose and rationale that allows for unintended consequences only from the longest of perspectives. In so doing, Holland provides little depth of character. Ironically, only Cato, who is depicted in most other accounts as a model of rigidity, is shown as thoughtfully responsive to events.<br />The author's depiction of Cicero sounds a particularly odd chord. In the space of just a few pages, Holland characterizes Cicero as \\"shrill\\", \\"purring\\", \\"maudlin\\", and \\"gloating\\". Such subtly judgmental word choices are in plentiful supply in the book, but Cicero gets a bigger share than most.<br />There are a few random areas in which Holland's writing achieves enough concreteness as to add to our understanding. One of these is his discussion of the economic ties between Mediterranean piracy and Rome. Another is the weight he gives to the pressure felt by young Roman noblemen to surpass their ancestors' achievements.<br />The Endnotes are about as terse as possible, and applied almost exclusively to direct quotations from primary sources. Having written himself that blank check mentioned above, Holland feels no need to justify his characterizations. There are a few footnotes in the text, almost all of which serve to point out the unreliability of Holland's speculative assertions. There is a decent Bibliography, the nine maps are serviceable, and there are many well-rendered photographs of Roman sculptures, drawings, and ruins.<br />Overall, I finished \\"Rubicon\\" with the sense that it had no real solidity, no core ideas. Among the various recent books on the Roman Republic, this one will appeal primarily to those whose tastes also run to Romance novels.tives. In so doing, Holland provides little depth of character.

In \\"Three Roads to the Alamo\\" William C. Davis fills those many pages with a narrative that seems to me the most authentic, objective, and substantiated account connected to the well-known but often-distorted events of 1836.<br />As the title indicates, Davies' organizing focus is on the biographies of the three American principals at San Antonio:  David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Travis. He traces their lives in interleaved chapters that follow a generally chronological path. None of the three turn out to be anything near the paragons of virtue and/or honesty depicted in the standard accounting. Courage they most certainly had, but in Davies' retelling it was a courage born of self-interest and opportunism. Of the three, only Crockett's story leaves us feeling any great sympathy toward its subject. Still, even in this revisionist account, their lives maintain an unsurpassed power to both instruct and excite.<br />Bowie is depicted as a land-speculator of the most dishonest kind. He achieved his fortune largely by forging Spanish Land Grants in Louisiana. Davies shows that in this he was hardly unique, although perhaps an over-achiever.<br />Travis led a short and mysterious life, and his character remains elusive despite Davies' prodigious research. Like many of the Alamo defenders, he came to Texas to reinvent himself and to leave behind a failed past. Davies does his best to sort out the details of that abandoned past life.<br />Crockett's road to a legendary death is well-told here in all its diversity. Davies is especially convincing in dealing with Crockett's political career, characterizing it as one marked by \\"naïvet&eacute;, miscalculations, and simple blunders.\\" And the author's detailing of the manipulation of Crockett by the Whig press and party leadership gives a dimension to the story that is not often treated. Despite a generally cynical portrayal, the author also provides ample evidence of Crockett's more appealing traits, which go far in explaining why this defeated ex-Congressman was received with such enthusiasm in Texas.<br />The events at the Alamo actually take up a small portion of the book, but a \\"small portion\\" here is still a substantial serving. There are also approximately 160 pages of Notes. I'd advise the reader not to skip them. Davies not only discusses there some of the major controversies of his subjects' lives and of the war's details; he also relegates some of the best stories to those pages - presumably because of their debatable legitimacy.<br />While Davies deals effectively with the ambiguities of the mission's final battle, I feel his most vital accomplishment is in showing his three subjects to be \\"in every way men of their time.\\"  In this sense, the book is as much about the dynamics of American life in the middle third of the 19th-century, and of Texas as an exemplar of American values, good and bad. It's also a damn good read.ortrayal, the author also provides ample evidence of Crockett's more appealing traits, which go far in explaining why this defeated ex-Congressman was received with such enthusiasm in Texas.<br />The events at the Alamo actually take up a small portion of the book, but a \\"small portion\\" here is still a substantial serving.

It's also a treatise on how a multi-cultural, tolerant society can not only flourish, but also serve as the incubator for world-wide advancement in the Arts, Mathematics, Philosophy, and Architecture. Maria Rosa Menocal's book provides a resonant political history of the region. It can serve as one the most unique travel guides to Southern Spain in the catalog. And, for better or worse, it has the now obligatory Harold Bloom Introduction.<br />Preparatory chapters review the region's history in fairly traditional fashion. Beginning in the year 711, Islamic armies from Northern Africa began a steady conquest of Spain that eventually reached the Pyrenees. Although achieved primarily through military means, the conquest ushered in an era of remarkable open-mindedness (measured against the standards of the day) that lasted until Ferdinand &amp; Isabella completed the Catholic Reconquista in 1492 and immediately embarked on their own perversely-reciprocal campaign of unicultural dominance.<br />The book's core sections then deal with the intervening years, a period that the author describes as \\"the chapter of Europe's culture when Jews, Christians, and Muslims lived side by side ... and nourished a complex culture of tolerance.\\" She tells not a political story, but instead employs a series of biographical vignettes that focus on the intellectual and cultural achievers of the era: thinkers and explorers such as Paul Alvarus (a Cordoban Christian), Ibn Khaldun (a Tunisian Muslim traveler to al-Andalus), and Maimonides (a Jewish refugee from Cordoba to Egypt). These profiles are ingeniously integrated to provide substance to Menocal's argument that this commingling of achievements reverberated far beyond medieval Iberia in space and time. Although the author certainly is most absorbed in those achievements, she also documents the injustices and displacements that flowed primarily from the cataclysmic battles for dominance among Muslim sects.<br />A truly admirable and evocative feature of \\"Ornament\\" is Menocal's language. She manages to be clear-sighted and precise, while yet achieving a subtle lyricism that mirrors the most beautiful of the region's creations.<br />There are three well-rendered maps, a decent although far from comprehensive bibliography, and a postscript written just after and reflecting on 9/11. The index is serviceable.<br />I finished \\"Ornament of the World\\" shortly after the good fortune of a vacation in southern Spain. Anyone who reads this book will want to make such a trip. Read the book, rent a house in Frigiliana, and make leisurely excursions to Grenada and Cordoba. You'll regret the loss of the culture Menocal describes, but the book and a visit to its remnants will still make you feel better about the world.cataclysmic battles for dominance among Muslim sects. <br />A truly admirable and evocative feature of \\"Ornament\\" is Menocal's language.

The first was \\"Blowback\\", published in 2000, which detailed his prescient warnings of dire, unintended consequences of the aggressiveness of certain of those policies, focusing primarily on those affecting East Asia.  Now that such warnings have been tragically realized, Chalmers has extended his analysis to the whole of U.S. policy. His subtitle, which concludes with \\"... and the End of the Republic\\", indicates that he believes the country may be too far gone to rescue.<br />After reading his bill of particulars, it's hard not to conclude that the only aspect of democratic life that continues to distinguish America is the freedom to publish books like this. In particular, Johnson believes that militarism - which he defines as the armed services putting their own preservation and expansion above all other concerns - has already corrupted American institutions beyond any reasonable hope of salvage.<br />Chalmers is a former consultant to the CIA. It isn't often that a critic - or even a potential critic - has had as much access to the kind of inside detailed information as did the author. (Although Daniel Ellsberg comes to mind.) He marshals that information to make a convincing case that interlocked military-related institutions have been given free rein by U.S. policy makers. \\"Foreign policy\\" has been replaced, he says, by military empire. Evidence is piled upon evidence.<br />All institutions, whether public or private, dedicate a large amount of their energy and resources towards extending their life and their reach. It is precisely this dynamic that we expect the Constitution and our lawmakers to properly constrain. Current events and the detail amassed by Chalmers show that our civilian leaders have largely abandoned such effort or have themselves become implicated in allowing the military to dominate far beyond what the famous valedictory warnings of Presidents Washington and Eisenhower envisioned.<br />Although Chalmers' evidence is convincing, he makes an unnecessary practice of visiting the same particulars repeatedly. For example, he sees as emblematic the creature-comforts and isolation from the surrounding cultures of our military bases, viewing them as deluding combinations of Club Med and Disneyland. While he provides plenty of substantiation, by repetition he elevates this charge to an importance equal to that of more serious accusations, such as the military's subversion of justice in the countries that \\"host\\" such bases.<br />I have a more fundamental difficulty with the book. What purpose does it serve? Only the most idealistic among us could be stirred to action by such a disheartening chronicle. The author's proposals for halting militarism and its consequences are perfunctory, vague, and melancholy. If Chalmers is right about the situation, the book will most likely serve best as documentary history to future generations, should there be any.ngs of Presidents Washington and Eisenhower envisioned. <br />Although Chalmers' evidence is convincing, he makes an unnecessary practice of visiting the same particulars repeatedly.

His entire book can be summed up by its first paragraph, whose last sentence reads as follows: \\"Even if human life does go on, civilization as we know it will not survive, unless we can find a way to live without fossil fuels.\\" The rest of this short book is meant to be proof of this thesis.<br />In the Introduction and the initial chapter, Goodstein is effective in convincing us that the impending crisis -- one precipitated by dwindling supplies of oil -- will be upon us much sooner than we think. He takes up what others have proposed or theorized as ways out of the crisis (methane, shale, nuclear fusion, etc.) and makes his case for why those are unlikely to suffice. After that the book fills in some very basic facts about the relevant physics associated with energy production and concludes with a revisit of the main ideas.<br />It's not clear what level of audience this book is aimed at. My best guess is that the author had in mind a group of college freshman with non-science majors. There's a strong air of condescension about the book, reinforced (perhaps I imagined this) by the standard author's photograph in which Goodstein strikes a stern, professorial expression. The diagrams meant to illustrate textual points are laughably simplistic.<br />This book is another example of what I sense is a disturbing trend in publishing. It's a small format book with generous line spacing and margins. The Notes are minimal. Yet it's been priced and reviewed as if it were a more substantial treatise, with little mention of its brevity.<br />Goodstein obviously knows what he's talking about. In \\"Out of Gas\\", he manages to convince us that this is an important subject deserving a more comprehensive and energetic effort.	2004-03-27

There are both many invigorating and some annoying aspects in this slim volume of chronologically arranged essays from Frank Kermode.<br />The best aspects arise when Kermode stays true to this title. That is, the book is finest when describing the milieu and preoccupations of Elizabethan England (or \\"Britain\\", since that distinction proves important to attitudes at the accession of James I) and relating those to the plays. Some of what struck me as the most interesting examples of this: Queen Elizabeth's belief that she was descended from the Roman Emperor Constantine and how that was reflected in \\"Antony and Cleopatra\\"; the issuing by King James in 1607 of a proclamation deploring crowds assembling \\"riotously in multitudes\\" and how that concern informs \\"Coriolanus\\"; and the customary conflating of \\"Macbeth\\" with the Gunpowder Plot enriched by a discussion of the play's use of the term \\"equivocation\\".<br />Among many fascinating aspects that go beyond the content of the plays, Kermode is especially informative about the distinction between the acting companies made up of boys and those of adult men players and the effect this had on many aspects of the theatrical environment. And there's his revelation that it was customary for the company to \\"dance a jig\\" after a play, even a tragedy.<br />Kermode's language is inventive and compelling, accessible for the most part even to someone -- like myself -- lacking knowledge of much of his context. Occasionally however his sentences become pretzel-like, circling back on themselves and becoming indigestible just when their meaning seems within grasp.<br />My primary and overarching complaint is that this is a small book (4 ½ x 7, 214 pages). Some of the author's most interesting discussions are abbreviated by the limitations of the format. The publisher has nonetheless thought it just to price it at $21.95.<br />Like many in the seemingly hermetically-sealed world of Shakespearean scholarship, Kermode can not resist providing unjustifiable biographical details. Despite an early warning against it, we find tell-tale language such as \\"we may guess that\\", \\"was almost certainly\\", and \\"as he must have\\". He assures us that Shakespeare preferred horses to walking. And it may have been the limitations of the format that forced him to present as unarguable such disputatious concepts as the existence of an \\"ur-Hamlet\\" and that Robert Greene's attributed attack on \\"Shake-scene\\" was definitely referring to the author of the plays.<br />It's clear that Frank Kermode has a deep and unique understanding of both the plays and the times that produced them. \\"The Age of Shakespeare\\" allows him to, by apposing, illuminate them.led world of Shakespearean scholarship, Kermode can not resist providing unjustifiable biographical details.

Awkward word coinage, showy phrasing, literary allusions seemingly designed to show off the author's breadth of arcane learning --- all of these contributed to a pretentiousness that was seriously off-putting. However, something happened as I read on. Either the author dropped his attention-calling approach, or I got used to it, or perhaps I just got smarter.<br />Eventually, all those literary allusions began to seem better integrated into what proved to be a well-structured, multi-faceted murder mystery. The author's own detective work into local 19th-century history contributes to fully-dimensioned characters, both real (Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Oliver Wendell Holmes, many other Boston notables) and imagined. Even Longfellow House becomes a palpable character in the story.<br />And if you've ever wondered what Boston and Cambridge were like in 1865, this book will give you a detailed and lasting image. It might even be an authentic image (although Cambridge must have been a much more compact place then, given the territory these mostly aged detectives manage to cover on foot).<br />A few more-than-incidental complaints remained. The number of red herrings is preposterously large. And the author's revelation of the killer is blunt and accomplished in a disappointingly uncreative manner. But even with these caveats, the novel makes for a mostly rewarding read.	2004-03-17

There are just too many gaps in our knowledge. But there is surely a mystery to be solved, and \\"Alias Shakespeare\\" by Joseph Sobran lays out an effective case that the Earl of Oxford, Edward de Vere, is the most likely solution to that mystery.<br />The book dispenses with the usual ad hominem attacks, amateur psychology, and farcical searches for hidden anagrams that have too often characterized all sides' arguments. He instead approaches this third-rail subject with refreshing objectivity and an apparently sincere search for the truth.<br />Marshalling a series of arguments and associated facts that point to Oxford, the book is well-organized at the macro level. It fails at times however in structuring the particulars. Threads of the argument are sometimes introduced, developed to a certain level, dropped, and then picked up again at a later point.<br />For example, Sobran [speaking of an introductory letter Oxford wrote to a friend's translation of \\"Cardanus Comfort\\"] writes \\"The whole letter, which especially foreshadows the [Shakespearean] Sonnets, is of utmost importance to the authorship question.\\" Having raised our utmost curiosity, he abandons this argument with the parenthetical \\"See Appendix 3.\\"<br />But his logic, when ultimately reconstructed, seems unassailable. The aforementioned Sonnets are at the core of this logic, and he convincingly lays out the parallels between their content and the well-documented course of Oxford's life. He effectively exposes the circular reasoning used by the defenders of the man he calls Mr. Shakspere - that is, the actor from Stratford-on-Avon. Those defenders deny the obvious autobiographical nature of the Sonnets, on the basis that they don't match with the flimsy autobiography we have of Mr. Shakspere. In fact, this type of circular reasoning pervades their entire defense, whether dealing with the purported dates of the plays or the importance of the early long poems.<br />There are, of course, legitimate counter-arguments. The problem is that arguments and counter-arguments in this matter are almost always qualitative and very difficult for the non-expert to evaluate. Sobran takes a stab at what is probably the only possible relevant quantitative approach: that of linguistic analysis. But here his use of such an approach amounts to no more than extensive word listings that he has found in common between Shakespeare and Oxford.<br />The problem for his case is that a more sophisticated, computer-based linguistic analysis has already cast serious doubt on the possibility of Shakespeare's works having been written by Oxford. (Elliott and Valenza, 1991.) Of course, the specific methods used in that analysis are also very difficult for the non-expert to assess. But at least such an analysis takes us closer to a scientific approach with a testable hypothesis.<br />Nonetheless, given an open mind, it would be hard to read \\"Alias Shakespeare\\" without agreeing with Sobran's conclusion. At a minimum, I doubt if any such reader will be laying odds on Mr. Shakspere being the true author.ported dates of the plays or the importance of the early long poems.<br />There are, of course, legitimate counter-arguments.

And it is hardly the over-simplification you might fear when reading in the Editor's Note that \\"no single day in history was more decisive for the creation of the United States than Christmas 1776.\\"<br />It is difficult to sum up a book that treats of so many events, topics, and themes, but I saw it primarily as a military history of the Revolution's opening act, covering the one year period beginning mid-March of 1776. The Crossing of the title could not even be termed the centerpiece of the account. After the Introduction, it is not mentioned again until p. 203, and then occupies only about 13 of the main text's 370-odd pages.<br />We learn first - in detail - of the recruitment and make-up of the opposing armies (with the British and Hessian contingents treated separately), the backgrounds of their principal commanders, of the competing strategies that each side considered and the differing processes of choosing from them, and then of the campaigns that ensued. The Americans chose to defend New York City, are routed, and then are chased across New Jersey and into Philadelphia. Then the decision to mount an attack back across the Delaware River at Trenton is made. The Americans succeed, repulse a counterattack, and follow-up with a march north against the enemy encampment at Princeton. After this third American success, the wearied armies withdraw into their winter quarters. Many \\"crossings\\" are documented, many as perilous and significant as that of the title. They just don't have famous paintings to heroicize them.<br />When covering the troop make-up and the like, Fischer's detail can be mind-numbing. But when writing of the battles themselves, he excels. A three-hour made-for-TV movie could not equal in drama the force of Fischer's one paragraph describing the moment the Hessian outpost commander realized the dimensions of the American force advancing on Trenton.<br />Embedded in these discussions is the informed development of what I see to be Fischer's two main, interlocking themes. The first is the tension in the American forces between the need for military discipline and the belief among the troops that liberty was a \\"voluntary agreement.\\" The second is Gen. Washington's evolving skills as a commander and strategist. These and other \\"lessons to be learned\\" from the events are then explicitly laid out in a concluding Chapter.<br />Well, hardly \\"concluding\\". Following are 24 Appendices dealing mostly with subsidiary military topics (duty rosters, casualty lists, etc.) that will be of interest mainly to those whose ancestors served in the fighting. Then come a Historiography, Bibliography, Abbreviations, Notes, Sources for Maps, Acknowledgements, and the comprehensive Index. This book is nothing if not well-documented.<br />At the risk of making this review far too lengthy, I must add that the maps are brilliantly executed - frequent, comprehensive but precisely drawn, and with an underlay of modern landmarks.<br />For this student, however, what emerged in greatest relief was the theme of historical contingency. Fischer acknowledges that major events such as these are the product of a nexus of forces, no one force a sufficient cause in itself. But here he defines contingency as \\"people making choices, and choices making a difference.\\" He clearly feels it was these choices that determined the outcome. As important as those choices - by Washington, Howe, Cornwallis, others - were, Fischer's account itself strongly suggests a more significant, purely fortuitous element: the weather.<br />It seems that at every critical point in almost every battle described here, the weather made turns in the Americans' favor. Just as Washington's army appears trapped and doomed on Brooklyn Heights, a Nor'easter swoops in and halts the British assault. When fog is needed to cloak the American advance onTrenton, it appears.

Despite it's being a coda to an account of what may have been history's most disastrous business transaction, this Epilogue consists of updates on 30 or so of the principal personalities involved (along with two corporate entities, one building, and one painting). The structure and content of the Epilogue emphasize that this is largely a gossip-column approach to business history. Author Nina Munk's great accomplishment is that she convinces us that this is exactly the correct approach.<br />Munk quickly traces the early history of Time, Inc. through the attitudes and accomplishments of its founder, Henry Luce. Then, using the biographical methodology she will employ throughout, she introduces the most fascinating of the drama's players, Gerald Levin, and exploits his early career to bring the story through Time's 1989 merger with Warner Communications. Along the way, other key characters such as Steve Ross (Warner's builder and CEO) and Ted Turner are profiled using Munk's by now standard technique. (I began to be surprised if a new player was introduced without my finding out what his or her father had done for a living.) A parallel section on AOL and its founder, Steve Case, follows. Then \\"The Big Deal\\" itself and its aftermath are examined in sections that are rich in personality-conflict, jealousy, culture-clash.<br />But don't expect that detail to provide any great depth on the business/economic/strategic issues involved, although these are given some necessary attention. As explanatory factors, they are persuasively made subsidiary to the personalities of Levin, Case, and their cronies. It is not news that many corporations both large and small are run as fiefdoms subservient to the whims of their chief executive. But if further proof is needed that \\"responsibility to shareholders\\" has become an American myth, this book can provide it.<br />Case and Levin enjoyed spectacular early successes. At no point in Munk's account does either ask how much of a role good luck or the confluence of favorable circumstances may have played in those successes.  To both principals (and to most of the others portrayed here), their success proved their own genius and assured future triumphs. As evidence to the contrary began to mount, they each forged ahead with no deviation in their individual and increasingly incongruous plans.<br />Munk details the hubris, but she only hints at alternative or larger explanations of how events unfolded. She does place a significant spotlight on the role of advertising revenues. At AOL, the need for this category of income slowly undermines Steve Case's avowed idealism -- of creating something profound that will benefit society. A similar, though less intense, history unfolds at Time, Inc. This suggests a way of looking at the history of media in general. A promising new medium (radio, publishing, television, the Web) is established and its prime mover is motivated by the desire to do social good, to change the way people think or interact. But then economic realities intrude, causing a greater and greater focus on publicity, marketing, and promotion instead of content. Advertising departments come to dominate decision-making, corrupting and degrading the medium, thus draining it of all social value.

Here's an emblematic sentence: \\"El Kurru should perhaps be considered as a candidate for the location of Krtn with its royal palace.\\" Is it possible to cram more conditionals into a single sentence? The text is filled with clauses such as \\"of which we are largely ignorant\\", \\"we have no way of knowing\\", and \\"no indisputable evidence exists\\".<br />Admittedly, this may indeed reflect the true state of affairs of our knowledge, or lack thereof, of the Kingdom of Kush. But to me the faults in the writing extend beyond failing to clarify an ambiguous situation or hesitancy in choosing between alternative explanations. Place-names are frequently introduced without explaining whether they are ancient or modern names. The relevant geography is treated as if the reader is already an expert in the Nile's meanderings. References are brief and seldom help in evaluating a citation's specific interpretation.  Succeeding paragraphs do not often link together. Sentences are often opaque, doggedly refusing to surrender their meaning ever after repeated readings.<br />And where the history of Kush touches on an event that may already be known to many readers - that being the Kushite intervention against Assyria in its assault on Jerusalem in 701 BC, as ambiguously recounted in the Old Testament -- Welsby fails to treat it with the rigor the episode deserves. He fails to recognize both that 1) the accounts in Kings I and II are superficially inconsistent and 2) resolving the discrepancy shows that the Kushites in fact saved the kingdom of Judah from certain destruction at a crucial moment in its history. (An absorbing and fully convincing exegesis is provided by Henry Aubin in \\"The Rescue of Jerusalem\\".)<br />The photographs - many in color - are extensive, stunning and provide an eloquence the writing lacks. The best that can be said of the diagrams, including a few meagerly drawn maps, is that they are no worse than the text.the text.	2004-02-25

Seeking it out (it's out of print) also provided a chance to discover all the used book stores in a 150 mile radius. But here the river is, at first, only an organizing principle. Ancient geology, Native American history, early European exploration and settlement, the rise and ebb of mining, wild west tales - all merit more than peripheral mention in this slim volume. If a concise, somewhat arbitrary visiting of all these topics in a readable style is what you're looking for, this book will satisfy. The title makes clear the author's environmental concerns, but these dominate only in the final chapters.<br /><br />Those final chapters make up a damning indictment of those who have caused and/or contributed to the drying up of the lower Gila. Blame is laid at the foot of personalities from Theodore Roosevelt to Charles Keating. The writing picks up steam and has visceral impact. A series of paragraphs dealing with government subsidies to ranching interests packs the greatest punch.<br /><br />I had already made myself somewhat conversant in Southwest history. So I found the reexamination of the related topics unnecessary, even if well-done. I would have liked one summary chapter on the more distant history, then more details and evaluation of the environmental impact wrought by 20th century development. Whether you will agree depends of course entirely on your own expectations and prior knowledge of the background.<br /><br />The book is well-illustrated and has a comprehensive (if now somewhat out-of-date) bibliographical essay. Perhaps his publisher will allow McNamee to reissue this volume with an updating of the Gila's fortunes and outlook.	2004-02-16

Most of us feel we know the story anyway. \\"Love and Hate in Jamestown\\" by David Price however fills in the familiar outline with some new muscles and sinews.<br />The book principally follows the history of Smith and of the Jamestown colony from the departure of the three ship flotilla from London in 1606 until Smith's death in 1631. This history is of course in large measure one of relations with the Indians. Price, not a historian, has written for both the Wall Street Journal and Investor's Business Daily, so the economic motivations and structure of the colony also are given significant attention.<br />The story is told in a straight-forward style that is largely a strength, but at times makes it seem to be no more than a summary of others' work. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Certainly, it's a well-documented book, with an extensive Bibliography.<br />The book highlights many facets of the Jamestown/Smith story that add to a reader's understanding. I found certain aspects especially effective in this regard. 1) John Smith's background as a commoner, fighter for Dutch independence, self-taught student of military tactics (especially munitions), enlistee in Austrian forces battling the Ottoman Empire, and a captive slave to the Turks. 2) The ease with which the Spanish could have destroyed the colony, changing the whole course of North American history, and the big power politics that led King Philip of Spain to inaction. 3) The evolving expectations of the Virginia Company's managers back in England of what they could expect as return on their investment.<br />At the well-known and crucial point in the story, the author does an effective job of recreating the circumstances of Smith's capture by the Powhatans and Pocahontas' role in his deliverance from certain death.<br />Although strong in presenting these various facets, the book suffers I believe from the lack of a centralizing focus. At many points it seems a biography of Smith, then veers into the dramatic details of the colony's travails after Smith is shipped back to England, then returns to a focus on Smith as he struggles to find an avenue for returning to the New World. Each shift of attention seems abrupt and the level of detail varies uncomfortably.<br />John Smith apparently kept good notes while in Virginia and then wrote extensively about his colonizing experiences. Price of course draws heavily on these narratives and appears to always accept Smith's version of events. This is both natural (Smith had many supporters who verified his accounts) and somewhat unbalanced. The book paints the other colonial leaders - with whom Smith was in unremitting conflict - as incredibly selfish, naïve, and catastrophically unwilling to learn from their mistakes. A more nuanced depiction of those with whom Smith clashed would have added depth to the book.<br />Oddly, while the book does deal with disease among the settlers, there is no such discussion of the role European germs might have played in the decimation of the natives. This is a disconcerting omission. Price also has an amateurish habit of unnecessarily foreshadowing events: \\"shortly he would disclose it\\", \\"before long, he would owe her his life several times over\\", and \\"Smith would not learn of this for a long time to come\\".<br />There are two well-rendered maps, one of the voyage from England through the West Indies and onto the North American coast, and one of the layout of Indian tribes in the large area surrounding Jamestown. A map of the colony and its immediate area would have been helpful, particularly since recent archaeological efforts have added greatly to knowledge of the site. The web site of \\"Jamestown Rediscovery\\" ([...]) provides a useful adjunct while reading Price's book.<br />Some notes on \\"Editorial Method\\" (covering the rendering of dialogue, spelling, place names, dates, etc.) follow the main text. These would have been better placed as an introduction. Readers would be advised to read these notes first.<br />I have no hesitation in an overall recommendation for \\"Love and Hate in Jamestown\\". It should add extensively to the general reader's understanding of a nation's beginnings and the crucial role played by one of history's most singular characters.ace names, dates, etc.) follow the main text.

But it is as much about those who have practiced in various scientific fields over the last 400 years or so. Science itself often takes a back seat to the personalities involved. This is illustrated by the fact that there is not a single illustration. Nor a single diagram. Author Bill Bryson seems as fascinated by scientists as he is by science.<br />In fact, the book could be viewed first and foremost as a series of absorbing vignettes of nearly everyone who has made significant contributions to our knowledge of the universe since the eighteenth century --- and of many whose contributions weren't so significant. These biographical sketches are artfully organized around a survey of the progress of scientific understanding in various fields: cosmology, earth sciences, biology, and particle physics taking the main parts. The explanations won't satisfy those looking for a deep or sophisticated understanding of the subject matter. (Entropy, for example, is covered in a footnote.) Nonetheless, taken as a whole, the book does provide a useful survey of modern scientific thought and its origins. For the science itself, the book falls somewhere between a dictionary and an encyclopedia, but more readable than either.<br />The book's main text comes dangerously close to 500 pages. It takes some time to get through, requiring frequent sabbaticals, but is always worth returning to.<br />The discussion of the likelihood of a meteor impact that could destroy civilization is truly alarming. That assessment alone makes the book either worth reading or worth avoiding, depending on whether you are a realist or an alarmist. The same holds true for Bryson's discussion of bacteria, which is definitely not for the squeamish.<br />Some of the biographical material may seem familiar, particularly the more significant episodes. This will be especially true to those who have read most of the essays and books of Stephen Jay Gould. Gould provided a much deeper insight into the details, context, and meaning of scientific discoveries and disputes. Like Gould, Bryson has an accessible writing style. Bryson's is breezier and often wittily sarcastic. Consider this characteristic excerpt from his description of the magnum opus of one James Hutton: \\"Hutton's `Theory of the Earth' is a strong candidate for the least read important book in science (or at least it would be if there weren't so many others).\\"<br />Two telling passages are found on successive pages in Bryson's discussion of cosmology. He writes \\"Astronomers have been sometimes been compelled (or willing) to base conclusions on notably scanty evidence,\\" and \\"At least the names for the two main possible culprits [for the purported missing matter in the universe] are entertaining: they are said to be either WIMPS ... or MACHOs.\\"  A possible inference from this and other examples (see \\"Quarks\\") is that scientists disguise their lack of certainty by spending too much time on inventing annoyingly cute names for purely theoretical concepts.<br />A very distinctive view of scientists and the scientific process emerges from the book. Those still living (with the exception of Francis Crick) get admiring treatment. Dead practitioners get mostly bad - or at least decidedly mixed - reviews. As a class, they come across as arbitrary, jealous, prone to error, conceited, pathologically eccentric, criminally willing to claim credit for the ideas of others, and obstinately unwilling to accept new ideas. However unfair or inaccurate, that certainly makes for interesting reading.ys and books of Stephen Jay Gould.

In particular, if you are interested in learning more about how Cicero advanced the art of politics during a multi-faceted career, this book will provide a fresh look at the methods -- primarily oratorical -- he employed.<br />This is the most accessible accounting I have read of the steadily intensifying battle between aristocracy and plebeians and of how that battle led to the rise of dictatorship. Cicero's role in trying to bridge this growing gap while protecting the integrity of the Senate forms the heart of the political side of his life as presented here. This is not to say that Everitt presents Cicero as man solely devoted to principle. On the contrary, the book highlights Cicero's early devotion to advancing his own interests and career. This led Cicero to some monumental injustices, for which he later paid a significant price.<br />Cicero's personal life takes on a dimension here not usually reflected in more general treatments of Roman history. His account of Cicero's devotion to his daughter, of his (Cicero's) reaction to her early death, and of how that affected Cicero's career are especially convincing.<br />Everitt has made copious use of the ancient sources. Much of Cicero's writings and correspondence has survived, and Everitt cites them frequently. In fact, his citations and notes on sources are a main reason why the book is so satisfying.<br />Because of this strong use of original sources, the power of Cicero's story itself, and Everitt's skill in telling it, I found it easy to credit the book with a certain authority in its depiction and conclusions.<br />There is some reason to be cautious however. Some reviewers, more credentialed than this reader, have claimed serious mischaracterizations in Everitt's picture of Roman politics. In an otherwise generally positive review, T. Corey Brennan, in the New York Times, faults Everitt for depicting the Roman constitution as more rigid than it really was. (I found Everitt's treatment of the constitution more nuanced than this.) Brennan also takes the author to task for badly simplifying Pompey's sack of Jerusalem. These examples seem unconvincing of a larger credibility issue, but the serious reader might want to check other sources as well.<br />There were two areas where the book propelled me to further reading. Cicero's sense of loss at the death of his daughter eventually led him to write the essays \\"On Emotions\\" and \\"On Grief\\". New translations by Margaret Graver have recently been published under the title \\"Cicero on the Emotions\\". On the political side, Everitt dramatically presents the use of mob violence as a political tool by the different factions. For those wanting to know more about this facet of pre-dictatorship Rome, a readable supplement to \\"Cicero\\" is Erik Hildinger's \\"Swords Against the Senate\\".<br />I liked \\"Cicero\\" for its multi-dimensioned story, its strong and comprehensive use of the ancient sources, and its stimulus for further reading. Although some specialists might claim that it contains unsophisticated and faulty aspects, I think most lay readers will find it rewarding and, for the most part, convincing.ns in Everitt's picture of Roman politics.

New, significant documents about the 1953 British/U.S. overthrow of the elected Iranian Prime Minister (Mohammed Mossadegh) have been made public recently. Stephen Kinzer utilizes these in weaving together a powerful, accessible history of why and how it happened.<br />While the British -- represented by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (now British Petroleum) -- come off as the real villains in this account, the CIA role is paramount. The prime mover for the agency is Kermit Roosevelt, grandson of Teddy. Kinzer paints an interesting portrait of Roosevelt, who emerges as a man dedicated to his mission, but with little care for its geopolitical underpinnings. Following his success in reinstalling the Shah in power, Roosevelt returns to Washington. There he advises the newly-elected Eisenhower administration that the Iranian coup should not be used as a model for continuing U.S.-initiated \\"regime change\\". His advice is, of course, ignored.<br />Kinzer obviously feels great admiration for Prime Minister Mossadegh. Even so, his portrayal is a nuanced one, and he sees Mossadegh as sharing a good portion of the blame for how events transpired. Kinzer does not shy from showing how U.S. involvement in the coup initiated a series of actions that have seriously damaged both Iran and the U.S. Nonetheless, his slant is not an ideological one. Not until the epilogue does his attitude towards Mossadegh verge on hero-worship. The book would have been better-served without this hagiographical addition.<br />All in all, I believe readers will appreciate Kinzers's historical context, his gripping account of the events themselves, and the crisp summary of how they have affected the world since.	2004-01-22

Yet Mr. Unsworth plows this ground with well-honed verbal and cerebral tools. Iphigenia and her story have never been so well-served. Odysseus has never been so well-skewered.<br />The novel begins with the Greek troop ships wind-deprived and stalled in harbor. Primarily through the perspective of an insecure seer, Calchas, we see the cynical machinations that Odysseus, Achilles, and others employ to control both the troops and their own supposed leaders. The parallels to current events are inevitable, but never strained. As the fate of Iphigenia emerges, the author skillfully interweaves convincing portraits of characters both familiar and of his own imaginative creation.<br />Unsworth's infusion of modern language strikes exactly the right tone, providing judicious reminders of the timelessness of the human themes embedded in the age-old story. Simultaneously, he punctures the heroic conceits that always accompany war and are used to justify it. Like sausages and laws, the making of war cannot often withstand scrutiny, and scrutiny (and entertainment) of the best and most creative kind is what this novel provides.	2004-01-15

(Think \\"Moby Dick\\", \\"Crime and Punishment\\", or even \\"Lonesome Dove\\".) But not \\"Pompeii\\" by Robert Harris. Here you are immediately swept up in the excitement and suspense provoked by the appointment of a new \\"aquarius\\" overseeing the Aqua Augusta, the massive aqueduct supplying Pompeii and surrounding cities with fresh water. The resentment of his new charges, the mystery of what has happened to his predecessor, the reader's awareness of the impending volcanic disaster - all this contributes to a compelling beginning within the first few pages.<br />The momentum established in the first chapter of \\"Pompeii\\" is carried through - until somewhere near the halfway point of the novel. At about that point my interest started to flag. It began to be clear that the breakneck pace of the story had momentarily obscured the formulaic structure, the lack of any real subtlety in drawing the characters, and the thinness of the insights into the structure of 1st century Roman culture. I began to breathe a sigh of relief each time the author paused all-too-briefly for an exposition of the engineering details of aqueduct construction.<br />Far shorter than any of the more famous novels mentioned above, \\"Pompeii\\" in the end proved a pleasant enough diversion. But the author missed the opportunity to turn his story-telling skills and immersion in the details of ancient water management techniques to greater advantage.	2004-01-14

He accepts, as would most (but not all) writers on the subject, that a historical Jesus existed and acted much as the gospels describe.  Beyond that, there is a healthy skepticism in his assessment of the genuineness of the relevant writings and of the motives of those who authored them and of those that either canonized or denounced them.  He presents an interesting survey of the many sects that vied for control of the Jesus legacy, analyzes their writings -- many only recently discovered -- and speculates on how our world would be different if some alternative to what we know as orthodox Christianity had emerged as dominant.<br />His method of organizing this material is confusing and leads to an excessive number of forward and backward references.  Too often it seems as if he is struggling in his attempt to make scholarly and arcane material accessible to the layman.  He takes the rubric &quot;tell them what you're going to tell them; tell them; and then tell them what you've told them&quot; to excess.  His inclusion of a chapter on Morton Smith's claimed discovery of a secret version of the Gospel of Mark is diverting and illustrates a few points.  But Ehrman's treatment of this episode from the 1950's is undercut by his apparent belief that Morton Smith fabricated the document.  What then is the purpose in giving it such an extended treatment?  This contributes to the feeling that Ehrman has not clearly thought through a successful approach to structuring his material.	2004-01-14

Yes, it has the compelling flow of a good novel, yet that flow was too often broken by unexpected failures to properly explain or illustrate key points.<br />I was frequently distracted by the lack of good maps to supplement Bergreen's prose accounts of the Armada's route. Most saliently, the author or his editors have chosen to not include a map of the Strait of Maglellan itself. Instead there are some admittedly fascinating depictions of portions of the Strait and a NASA photograph from space that I found utterly indecipherable.<br />While Bergreen's long asides on peripheral topics often hit the mark -- such as his discussion of scurvy and its eventual decoding -- others, including some crucial to his account, fall substantially short. Despite the issue's importance, none of Bergreen's numerous attempts to explain the Pope's demarcation of Spanish and Portugese spheres of control (the Treaty of Tordesiillas) adequately clarify how it applied to the Spice Islands on the other side of the world and already explored by Portugal. Of course, this could possibly be the result of my own denseness; others may find his explication perfectly comprehensible. I did not.<br />Also in this category of incomplete clarification is the author's mention of the International Date Line and the fact of its non-existence in Magellan's day. He references this drawback twice and both times he is satisfied with saying that the Dateline now extends westward from Guam. Of all the facets he could emphasize, this seems an odd choice given that the Dateline does (and must) run for the most part North-South. The location of the Date Line is in fact a highly complex subject (see [...] yet no map that I'm aware of shows it running near Guam. Yes, as a U.S. possession, Guam maintains an idiosyncratic relationship to GMT. And, yes, Guam was Magellan's first landing after crossing the Pacific.
