US	52778876	R2KUVLMB63YYER	0873388453	649969831	Under Kilimanjaro	Books	5	37	42	N	N	How lucky we are to have another Hemingway book.	Hemingway. The very name means great writing. Alas, the man himself died, by his own hand, decades ago. No more great writing from him. But no! Fortune, my friends, has smiled on the book lover this day. It seems the great author squirreled away several manuscripts he wrote in the 1950s, and the Hemingway Foundation has just released the one he called \\"the African book.\\" UNDER KILIMANJARO isn't just a book. It's an experience. <br /> <br />You'll have to forgive my gushing. I've spent the last few weeks hunting in Africa with \\"Papa\\" Hemingway and his fourth wife, Mary. That's what it felt like, too -- like I was out there on the plains of Kenya, sleeping in a tent at night with the roar of a lion rumbling through the dark air. The book's pace is deliberately slow, which gives the reader a sense of the timelessness of the camp by the plains under the great African mountain. So we listen in on the talk around the campfire and watch birds soar overhead almost in real time. When the hunt is on, we follow both the hunter and the hunted. <br /> <br />The book purports to be fiction, but it is every inch a memoir. Papa and Mary are, after all, the main characters. There are several levels to enjoy -- the pure literary quality, the exciting adventure, the enjoyable travelogue, the often humorous commentary. And it's a love story, but not what you'd expect; it's a tribute to his beloved Africa: \\"In Africa a thing is true at first light and a lie by noon and you have no more respect for it than for the lovely, perfect weed-fringed lake you see across the sun-baked salt plain. You have walked across that plain in the morning and you know that no such lake is there. But now it is there absolutely true, beautiful and believable.\\" <br /> <br />In some of my favorite passages, he remembers his old writing pals, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ford Madox Ford, Ezra Pound and others. He recalls how much he loved Paris in \\"the old days\\" and talks about Havana, Key West and the Spanish Civil War. These references pop up when you least expect them. <br /> <br />He goes from self-effacing to arrogant, sometimes in the same paragraph. His prose is at the same time gritty and elegant. Sometimes it's moving, sometimes it's funny, always it's fascinating. <br /> <br />The book itself has an introduction that explains the details of the posthumous publication. In back, the reader can find a glossary of Swahili terms, a list of characters and notes on the editing of the text. On the inside covers are reproductions of actual manuscript pages in Hemingway's own handwriting. Nina Smart has provided simple, almost iconic African drawings for each chapter heading.	2005-09-16

He tells true stories of his interaction with Amish farmers, changing only the names to preserve their anonymity. The illustrations, including the cover art, were done by Crist C. Miller, an Amish man who lives in Geauga County. <br /> <br />James's lament throughout the book is \\"How can I possibly help these people who seem bent on living in the past?\\" How can they continue to do everything the old way when so much modern technology is available to help them out? He never asks why they live as they do; he respects their ways and in fact finds them fascinating, calling their farms \\"focused yet flexible, vertically integrated firms.\\" <br /> <br />We get to go along with the congenial author on his adventures among the Amish as he directs a team of horses in plowing a field, helps make maple syrup on one farm and milks cows at another. He explains their farming methods, how their often old-fashioned machinery works and what role animals play. <br /> <br />The Amish world is not idyllic, as a lot of tourists think. There is a definite toll on the body and the pocketbook because they can't use most modern equipment. Their economy is dependent on the rules the community chooses to live by. For example,  because many Amish communities allow no refrigeration, their milk is only grade B and sells for less money, even though it  requires the same amount of work and the same rules of cleanliness. Other communities do allow refrigeration, and so their milk is grade A and brings in more money. <br /> <br />As part of his job, James figures out the costs of everything to help the farmers make decisions about their future. For one family, he discusses the economic merits of dairy vs. vegetable farming. For another, he plans an entire budget, adding up everything a young man will need in order to buy and operate a farm. \\"The economics are critically important,\\" says James, \\"because the 'plain' farm family lifestyle the Amish so cherish is predicated on the operation of a profitable farm.\\" <br /> <br />In addition, James talks about Amish society: how children are educated, how the church is structured and how the family  dynamic changes when elders retire. <br /> <br />Farming enthusiasts will love this book, as will anyone interested in the Amish culture. It's an interesting and heart-warming read and a fascinating look into a world filled with strong but gentle people.	2005-08-04

On a summer evening in August 1951, she walked to a park just a few doors from home to see a local talent show with her best friend, Patsy. Her disappearance later that night led to what Badal calls \\"the largest manhunt in Cleveland history\\" and raised \\"the chilling possibility that she had been grabbed literally within sight of the family house.\\" <br /> <br />Badal investigated the case by sifting through old newspapers and police files. He describes the dynamic interaction among the three vying newspapers in Cleveland -- an intriguing story in  itself -- along with the city's political machinations. The author retraces the shy girl's activities just before she disappeared and provides an exacting timeline of events. He talks about the public's reaction to the crime: Many helped in the search while crowds gathered in front of the family home to get a glimpse of the \\"gloomy house where tragedy struck.\\" <br /> <br />The authorities tracked down all known sex offenders, drained a pond, sent divers into Lake Erie, did flyovers in planes and led basement-to-attic searches. They followed up on cryptic messages and false leads and even took calls from psychics and  extortionists. As Badal says, the hoaxes ranged \\"from the merely stupid to the heartlessly cruel.\\" <br /> <br />Decades after the crime, police were still investigating, interviewing serial killers and molesters. Even today there are a lot more questions than answers. The ordeal was so horrendous for Beverly's mother that she \\"died, quite literally of grief, in 1956,\\" says Badal. <br /> <br />We tend to think of the abduction of children as a modern phenomenon, forgetting that it's always been aterrifying fact of life. <br /> <br />I started this book knowing that the case was never solved and I still couldn't put it down. The details are positively haunting and the complex character studies make it easy to realize that these were real people who actually went through this ordeal, who truly lost their little girl. What in the world happened to her?	2005-08-04

Just look at unforgettable places like Oz created by L. Frank Baum, J.M. Barrie's Neverland, J.R.R. Tolkien's  Middle Earth, C.S. Lewis's Narnia, and characters as different as Willy Wonka, Don Quixote, Scarlett O'Hara, and Long John Silver. <br /> <br />Add to these the place a lot of us have been inhabiting since our long-awaited book finally hit the stores: Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And to the best-loved characters of all time we must add a name that has already  become an archetype in modern literature: Harry Potter. <br /> <br />The sixth installment in the remarkable seven-part work of J.K. Rowling is \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,\\" featuring Rowling's wunderkind and his best friends, Ron and Hermione. The characters are now 16 and in their sixth year at Hogwarts, where staircases change their mind and the figures in paintings speak to passersby, where owls deliver the mail and the school sport is played on flying broomsticks. As Rowling ages the children naturally, she seamlessly reintroduces characters and ideas from the past and moves everything forward. <br /> <br />The plot, basically good vs. evil, gets more and more intense with each book, and in this go-round we get a lot more back story about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, the ultimate evil sorcerer. This time, though, the plot feels a little more serious, more  focused -- maybe because Harry is older and he's looking for revenge. Now termed \\"The Chosen One\\" -- chosen to save the world from the evil ones -- Harry must carry a lot of weight on his slender shoulders, and he bears it gracefully, taking care of those he loves and getting himself ready for the final battle, set for book seven. Those of us who have watched Harry grow up are not disappointed in him. <br /> <br />The long waitfor this book was worth it. If possible, it's even better than the last. I can see where the extra time was spent, making the book more streamlined. And even with the seriousness of the subject matter, Rowling's trademark comic relief still pops in at unexpected moments. Will I tell you what happens in the book? Oh, no -- that would spoil the surprises in store, both good and bad. <br /> <br />If you're new to the series, be sure to start with book one. It introduces the reader to all the wonderful details in the world of Wizards and Muggles that you'll need to know later. Then, read them in order. Because of the ongoing storyline, you really can't start with book six and expect to understand what's going on. Personally, I fell in love with the whole gang in book one when they were riding on the train --the Hogwarts Express -- on their way to the school. I don't ever want to get over that feeling. To me, these books are pure joy. <br /> <br />Rowling is absolutely amazing. I can't say enough good things about her writing. I've studied mythology and symbology and I'm telling you, she has, too. She incorporates the classic hero myth with a modern storyline and mixes genuine literary allusions with her own ideas to give even the most mundane of objects and  creatures -- from jellybeans to mirrors, from a snow-white owl to a flame-colored phoenix -- special meaning and a colorful history. My favorite thing about her writing may be the way she plays with words, coming up with colorful names like Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Azcaban, Dumblefore, and Diagon Alley. <br /> <br />This book's arrival marks the largest first printing of any book, ever; the publisher ordered 10.8 million copies, and Rowling is now the best-selling author on Amazon.com. Analysts are scrambling to interpret the \\"hidden meaning\\" in the books, hinting that the sacrifices indicate spirit ual allegory or that the shadows of  terrorism mirror what's happening in our world today. <br /> <br />Why is Rowlingso successful? Kids WANT to read these books. Did I say \\"read\\" them? Make that memorize them, scrutinize them, devour them. The books are incredibly fun. No wonder children jump up and down in anticipation of the newest glimpse into that special world. But adults love the books, too, and I believe an  injustice was done when the decision was made to take the Potter books off the general bestseller lists and put them only on the children's lists. In fact, this is definitely not a bedtime story to read to 6-year-olds. The situations are often complex and can be downright scary. <br /> <br />I enjoyed every word of the 652-page tome. I laughed. Igasped. I cried. But then, I'm a fan. There are people I know and respect who aren't thrilled with the Harry Potter books. I also know people who don't like chocolate. Or baby animals. Or rainbows. Go figure. <br /> <br />So it turns out I was right all along -- great writers ARE magical. They can create a whole new world, even a whole new vocabulary, and, along the way, change the way the reader sees the world. They can turn bored children into eager, excited readers. They can transform grown-ups into children again. They can set a spark to a dormant imagination and make it burst into a mind full of wonder. They make people want to read more, think more, feel more. They perform perhaps the most powerful magic of all: they change the world for the better.	2005-08-04

Extraordinary Italian writer Umberto Eco is familiar for his phenomenal best-seller, THE NAME OF THE ROSE, among other works. THE MYSTERIOUS FLAME OF QUEEN LOANA takes the reader for a bizarre ride through the past to discover how memory operates. In Italy, 60-year-old Giambatistta \\"Yambo\\" Bodoni has suffered a stroke that has affected his memory. Flashes of sound and literary allusions fill the book's opening pages as Yambo's mind approaches consciousness in a hospital room. He knows only words and sounds, literary references in several languages, a poem here, Sherlock Holmes there, as his brain tries to re-focus. It's a brilliant, exciting and very dizzying sequence. Yambo can't remember who he is or who the people around him are, but he seems to remember all sorts of other things. When he goes off to his childhood home in the country to recuperate, he finds memories of his boyhood in the books and toys he grew up with. <br /> <br />\\"Certain images spark something inside you,\\" he says and goes in search of more of that spark or \\"mysterious flame.\\" As he re-reads all his childhood books, he also rediscovers old Fascist material and horrible anti-Semitic propaganda from the early 1940s. He's not sure how it all fits  together in his life. \\"It is awkward, revisiting a world you have seen  before,\\" he says, \\"like coming home, after a long journey, to someone else's house.\\" <br /> <br />Lots of remarkable col orful illustrations, reprinted from actual French, German and mostly Italian ads, posters, cartoons and book covers, also evoke strong memories. I couldn't relate to most of the European allusions, but I related to the process. If he had been talking about the books I grew up with, it would have stirred strong memories of my own. The segments during which he is in and out of consciousness are fascinating and poetic, demonstrating how he thinks and what he perceives. The book is a beautiful recreation of the memory-triggering process. As we follow how he regains his memory, the process seems to ring true. Eco is a gifted craftsman. This is truly a masterpiece, and some of the insights are breathtaking.	2005-07-08
US	52778876	R1COXAFOYXWEE7	0060509414	292132527	Baker Towers	Books	5	16	17	N	N	A very good read.	BAKER TOWERS by Jennifer Haigh is a good, old-fashioned family saga, the kind you don't seem to find anymore. Even the cover looks like that of an \\"old\\" book. The impoverished Novak family and its five children struggle to get by in a coal mining town in Pennsylvania during World War II. As the war changes the world, we see how it changes the town and each member of the family. <br /> <br />The award-winning author has created a definite sense of time and place in this highly readable story. She writes beautifully and thoughtfully: \\"His old buddy seemed to him a kind of bookmark, holding his place in a life he himself had started but decided not to finish,\\" says the book. And later, \\"Each disappointment had weakened her; losing hope was like losing blood. She could not survive another failure. Already she was hemorrhaging from  regret.\\" Ooh. Powerful language. <br /> <br />I'm happy to report that the women in the book are not just cardboard cutouts; they're complex and very real and reflect the changing roles of women. It isn't a perfect book, and it's sometimes sad, but it makes a very good read.	2005-07-08

I relished every moment of IRELAND by Frank Delaney, right from its opening words: \\"Wonderfully, it was the boy who saw him first ... a tall figure in a ragged black coat and a ruined old hat was walking down the darkening hillside; and he was heading toward the house.\\" The man is a traveling storyteller, \\"the last of his breed,\\" who will tell stories in exchange for a place to stay and something to eat. Like Scheherezade in \\"1001 Arabian Nights,\\" how many nights will the family let the visitor stay if he can entrance them with his stories? The man tells the story of Ireland a little at a time, a battle here, a hero there. He starts with the origin of the ancient rock, \\"stone born of fire and cooled by sea,\\" in a segment reminiscent of James Michener's sagas. He tells of the building of prehistoric Newgrange and relates colorful stories about ancient kings, St. Patrick and the legendary Finn MacCool. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, we learn about the boy, Ronan O'Mara, 9 years old when he first hears the Storyteller in his home in 1951. The old man seems to see a promise in the boy, and we suspect he has chosen him for his apprentice. Ronan is instantly fascinated by the Storyteller. Even after the man has gone away, the boy is eager for more and reads all the Irish history he can find, because he has fallen in love with the stories. As he grows up, Ronan follows the Storyteller, determined to catch up with him. <br />The history of Ireland is messy, and the stories get more brutal and more bloody, with a lot of battles. There are also dramas and mysteries going on within Ronan's family, and secrets are gradually revealed. <br /> <br />Some of my favorite parts of the book feature the Storyteller using simple language to explain beautiful thoughts: \\"I like cobwebs on branches, the fine silver netting with drops of dew at the corners.\\" But he is most eloquent when he speaks of his love for Ireland and its people. \\"We are seers.... Islands appearing in the ocean off the coastsurprise no one ... ghosts stride hillsides.... We are infinitely permissive of possibility; we rule out nothing.\\" And  especially: \\"But when I come out on the road of a morning, when I have had a night's sleep and perhaps a breakfast, and the sun lights a hill in the distance, a hill I know I shall walk across an hour or two thence, and it is green and silken to my eye, and the clouds have begun their slow, fat rolling journey across the sky, no land in the world can inspire such love in a common man.\\" <br /> <br />The great sweep of the book reminds me of Edward Rutherford's LONDON. This is an impressive epic and a very moving, satisfying read. It will make the Irish in you want to get up and dance. And if you're not Irish, you may just wish you were.	2005-07-08

If you like mysteries -- especially books with smart females in charge -- Sue Grafton is the author to read. Her Kinsey Millhone is the gold standard of female detectives, the quintessential star to whom other mystery writers point, even having their own characters refer to Kinsey as if she were real. R IS FOR RICOCHET is the 18th in the alphabetical series, starting with A IS FOR ALIBI, that makes up the ongoing story of Kinsey's life. You don't have to read them in order, but it helps. <br /> <br />Kinsey is a private detective in Santa Teresa, Calif. \\"My jobs are varied,\\" she tells us, \\"not always lucrative, but sufficient to keep me housed and fed and ahead of my bills.\\" She does employee background checks, tracks down missing persons,  locates heirs entitled to money in estates, and investigates claims involving arson, fraud or wrongful death. This variety is what keeps the plot lines fresh. <br /> <br />In \\"R, Kinsey has been hired to \\"baby-sit\\" a man's daughter on her release from prison, where she did time for theft. But she can't keep the ex-con from getting involved with shady characters in a money-laundering scheme. As usual, the fantastic edge-of-your-seat action builds to a climax and you just have to hold your breath and ride along until the villains are foiled. <br /> <br />Kinsey narrates her tale as \\"a story about romance -- love gone right, love gone wrong, and matters somewhere in between.\\" Some of that \\"in between\\" involves local police officer Cheney Phillips. \\"His dark hair was curly, his dark gaze revealing a curious mix of cop-think and come-hither,\\" she says. \\"His aftershave smelled like spices, the scent of tiny blossoms on some night-blooming shrub. This was pitiful. I wanted to lean over and sniff deeply at the side of his face.\\" Aw, come on -- this is great stuff! <br /> <br />Grafton's writing creates a very real sense of place by giving the town a history and using detail through place names, landmarks, descriptions of the landscape, foliage, beaches, mountains, and what's nearby and far up the road. Grafton is amazing. She's simply the best.	2005-07-08

In METRO GIRL, she introduces us to a new character: Alexandra Barnaby. As we meet tomboyish \\"Barney,\\" she is fixing cars in a garage in Baltimore when her younger brother, Bill, calls from Miami begging her to help him, and then he promptly disappears. Well, what's a girl to do? She heads south to find him, taking us with her to sunny Florida. Once there, she runs into \\"NASCAR Guy\\" Sam, who won't leave her alone. He's a celebrity with a swollen head and wants to be the object of her affections, but what does she think of him? <br /> <br />This is a real adventure with lots of action -- they're playing spy in the city, they're on a boat speeding toward Cuba, and there are some really nasty bad guys after them. Want some sunken treasure? How about a weapon of mass destruction? They're in there. And oh, yeah, there's a lot of chemistry in the air and flirting going on. The book reads like driving around a race track -- fast paced with lots of curves and a few spills. And the ending is really fun. <br /> <br />Now, I love Evanovich's Stephanie Plum, but Barney is a breath of fresh air. Warning: Do not compare the two characters, because you may just be cheating yourself out of a fun ride and a great read. Evanovich says she's going to write about this character again, and I say, \\"Good!\\"	2005-07-08
US	52778876	RKF77LJLIJJDX	0060778970	142631692	Zorro: A Novel	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Sure to become a classic!	Did you ever come to the end of a book and wish it would just go on and on because it's so wonderful you don't want it to end? A book like that is worth its weight in gold, and I found one: it's ZORRO by Isabel Allende. You may be familiar with Allende's enjoyable writing in the popular book club book, \\"Daughter of Fortune,\\" but I like this one even more. The text is beautifully translated from Spanish and it's so easy to read that the pages seem to turn themselves. <br /> <br />Because of the familiar \\"Zorro\\" persona, from both the late-1950s TV image of Disney's handsome Guy Williams and the more recent movie image of the yummy Antonio Banderas, I thought the book would be more romantic -- you know, handsome hunk in a mask kissing a lot of beautiful, swooning ladies. Well, it isn't that, and I didn't miss it at all. But it is a real swashbuckler, with lots of action, and it's amazing fun. <br /> <br />This is the prequel to the story of the dashing swordsman who fought for justice in early California. Although that legend was long established before Allende came along, her work adds the perfectly fitted pieces to the classic puzzle that is the Zorro legend -- his boyhood, his education and his motivation. I think it will become an adventure classic for adults and kids alike. <br /> <br />The story starts with the meeting of Diego de la Vega's parents and his birth in 1795. It ends with his first acts as the mysterious caped avenger. In between, we travel with him from California to Europe and we meet American Indians, Gypsies, sailors, pirates and aristocrats. We see how Young Diego and his lifelong friend, Bernardo, learn the principles of justice from horrifying acts of prejudice they witness as children and government corruption they are subject to as adults. We learn why Bernardo doesn't speak, how Diego took the name Zorro, and what the governmental factors were that drove him to his destiny. We see how he picks up his skills -- fencing, horse riding, acrobatics, illusion -- and adds to his Zorro disguise one element at a time -- a mask here, a horse there -- until he's fully prepared to fight for the downtrodden. I don't normally like fight scenes, but these drew me in right away and I followed them intently. <br /> <br />I found myself getting lost in the story, losing track of time. This book is absolutely captivating! An excellent, excellent read for any age.	2005-06-15

The mini-biographies are presented chrolonologically and each lists the person's commonly known name, birth and death dates and \\"real Italian name.\\" For example, here's a real mind-blower: Iron Eyes Cody, who became well known as the American Indian whose single tear rolled down his anguished face in an anti-littering TV commercial in the 1970s, was an Italian actor, born Espera (Oscar) de Corti. <br /> <br />So, how did all these \\"Italians\\" lose their Italian names? Many had Italian mothers; some changed their names for political or social reasons or to avoid anti-Italian prejudice. Others, as evidenced in a running gag throughout the book, were \\"co-opted,\\" mostly by the French, who claimed that all the best people had to be from France. My favorite listing is an example of that. Francesco Procopio dei Coltelli opened a coffee shop in Paris in 1686 and called it Procopio. \\"To attract thinking men, he made the city's only newspaper available for his clientele -- free,\\" according to the book. \\"To attract writers, he made paper, pens and ink available -- also free.\\" Thus, it became the world's first literary coffee shop and \\"is acknowledged to be the oldest continuously operating restaurant in the world.\\" The French, deciding it was a good thing, co-opted it and changed the name to Le Procope. <br /> <br />The book never gets dull because each entry is only one or two pages long. So many artists are included in the book that if you only readit for the art history trivia, you'll have a trove of fascinating insights.	2005-06-15

To get over his heartache, he quits his job, uses his last paycheck as \\"a backstage pass to the planet\\" and sets off to see the world. He ends up spending two years traveling with his brother through Latin America, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia and Africa.    Wisner is really good at writing about his adventures, and the brothers' relationship is heartwarming. His letters back home paint marvelous pictures in words: \\"Vietnam today is ... the women in their pencil tip bamboo hats, crouched on the sidewalks, hawking delicious noodle soups piled high with bean sprouts and fresh basil. It's the Flying Nun schoolgirls on bikes with their billowy white au dai uniforms and long gloves to keep their skin pale.\\"    The brothers meet fascinating people on their \\"honeymoon,\\" including my favorites: a \\"prophet\\" in Ecuador whose final words to the brothers are \\"Do what's right\\" and a World War II veteran revisiting the small South Pacific island that was the site of the battle in which he lost his friend.    I enjoyed the book overall and will be happy to read his next adventures.	2005-06-03

I simply loved \\"99 Days to Panama: An Exploration of Central America by Motorhome\\" by Dr. John and Harriet Halkyard. I spent a whole weekend with the warm and friendly couple in the pages of their surprising book and felt as if I had taken the vacation with them myself. The book is charming and enchanting and hard to put down. This is why I read travel books!<br /><br />It reads like letters from a friend. Harriet seems to be doing the writing, and I liked her instantly. She doesn't skimp on her advice, telling us what towns to avoid, how much bribe money you'll need, how much time will be wasted if you don't have the proper paperwork and even if you do, and how to avoid getting robbed. A general map of the couple's trip can be found in the front of the book with more detailed maps in the appendix, so you can follow along at all times. Not enough travel books do this. And there are color photographs on almost every page.<br /><br />It's a lot of fun. Their adventures include serving as an ambulance for a local family, riding on a boat through the Panama Canal, cave tubing in  Belize and hiking through the tops of trees in a rainforest. As they drive through towns with curious names like Chichicastenango in Guatemala and Double Head Cabbage in Belize, the respect of the Halkyards for the local people and for fellow travelers they encounter comes through. They make friends easily by giving out candy, balloons and soccer balls to the kids and vegetable seeds and pens to the adults.<br /><br />Harriet engages us in her enthusiasm for the people and places she visits, and she really has quite a way with words. In  Honduras: \\"The scenery we passed through was magnificent. Every turn presented new dramatic sweeping vistas. I could stand and turn in a circle and be in awestruck wonder in each direction.\\" In Costa Rica: \\"The narrow damp dirt trail sliced through the ultimate jungle that reached so high it was as though the clumps of green at the top were in a different world.\\" At the Blue Hole in Belize: \\"It was a magical place. I could imagine an ogre hiding in the rock crannies, or good fairies living among the ferns and mosses on the cliff edges.\\"<br /><br />Besides being a fascinating memoir, the book is a very good read. And it's a must-read for anybody who wants to go to Central America or anyone who wants to travel in an RV. A lot of useful information is included in the appendix, where the authors list all their expenses, their secret hiding places in the RV, gas prices in different countries, what to take along, how to travel with a dog, language schools, information on motorhome maintenance (finding dump stations, water, electricity, security, communications), camping places, directions with GPS coordinates and much more.

NATIVES AND EXOTICS by Jane Alison is a luscious book with phrasing so drop-dead gorgeous you have to stop and read it again to dwell on how right it is. The book is presented in sections, jumping across time and around the world with several members of one family. The author starts us off in 1786 in various locales and leaps ahead to about 1970 in Ecuador, then back to 1929 in Southern Australia, back further to 1822 in Scotland and the Portuguese Azores and then to 1981 in the United States. But somehow she manages not to get us lost. <br /> <br />My favorite character is young Alice, born in Australia, who has traveled with her mother and her diplomat stepfather to Ecuador where, at 9 years old, she comes to \\"her fourth country, sixth city, seventh house.\\" Alice is mesmerized by the lushness of Ecuador, and she marvels in the small details of life in another country - shopping for fruit, buying boots, everything becomes an adventure. It's fascinating to see what a child in that position finds interesting, and it all rings true because Jane Alison grew up in foreign service, so she is writing from what she knows. <br /> <br />The author conveys Alice's excitement well: \\"All at once she was ripped open: all that light and color poured into her.\\" The tone reminded me of \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" by Barbara Kingsolver (which I highly recommend), as did some of the tropical descriptions and the perceptions of a traveling child who is coming of age. <br /> <br />Amid recurring themes of earth and sea, plants and paradise, building and destroying, people ponder the awesome wonder and intense beauty in the earth and the horrors men do - even unwittingly - to each other, to the land, to animals and even to plants. Always there's talk of the earth, of mountains forming, of what's under the oceans, the discoveries of dinosaur bones and continental drift, the incomprehensible age of the earth. <br /> <br />Curious people want to know how nature works. We meet a mariner who sailed the seas with Captain Cook, and several famous characters show up: Sir Joseph Banks, who sent people around the world to \\"discover and seize the world's living wealth\\" of botanical wonders; Charles Darwin on the HMS Beagle; and a young naturalist  named Alexander von Humboldt who \\"wished to plumb the secret unities of nature -- to learn how living things gained a foothold on land, how land itself was created.\\" <br /> <br />Much of Alison's writing is like poetry, with impossible  phrases that fit perfectly: \\"He had a tight, negotiating mouth.\\" \\"So up Alice went, ... up the implausible stairs.\\" Flags \\"slowly furled and unfurled against the primitive sky.\\" <br /> <br />Beautifully done.	2005-05-13
US	52778876	R36PUSKCE3XD76	0151011176	354022357	Lighthousekeeping	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Sensual and extraordinary.	LIGHTHOUSEKEEPING by Jeanette Winterson is a saga of dualities, of dark and light, wind and sea, an old man leading a double life, a young girl having to start life over. I really like the book's beginning, at a cold lighthouse in northern Scotland with a swirling storm of images that duplicate the wind and sea and give us a definite sense of place. It's set in the late 20th century, but seems out of time -- it always seems ancient. <br /> <br />When the narrator, Silver, is orphaned, a family takes her in to teach her lighthousekeeping. Everything's dark except the lighthouse light, and all energy goes toward it. \\"Our business was light, but we lived in darkness,\\" she says. Every lighthouse has a story, she's told, and as part of her training she has to learn them all. This is a story about storytelling, bringing light to illuminate the darkness, and names continue the metaphor: Silver reflects everything around her; one of the characters is named Dark, and when he takes on an alias, he names himself Lux or light. <br /> <br />Naturally, I identified with Silver's love for books. One of my favorite moments was her trip to the library, where an unfriendly librarian wouldn't let her take out books already reserved for other customers. Her clever solution: \\"I have a list of titles that I leave at the desk, because they are bound to be written some day, and it's best to be ahead of the queue.\\" <br /> <br />The best way to describe the -- let me call it \\"structure,\\" rather than \\"plot\\" -- is probably to use the narrator's own words: \\"This is not a love story, but love is in it. That is, love is just outside it, looking for a way to break in.\\" She warns us that \\"a beginning, a middle and an end is the proper way to tell a story. But I have difficulty with that method.\\" Several times the structure had me scratching my head, and I don't mind admitting that I was a little confused by the insertion of the story of Tristan and Isolde and the tale of a talking bird, seemingly thrown in like snapshots from a totally different book. <br /> <br />But it's good, and good literature reminds its readers of other important reads. The author admits that Virginia Woolf's \\"To the Lighthouse\\" resonates in her book. And parts of LIGHTHOUSEKEEPING, especially in the beginning, remind me of \\"Ahab's Wife\\" by Sena Jeter Naslund. I loved that one and strongly recommend it -- especially the first half, in which I was totally absorbed in her adventures at the lighthouse and riding high in the lookout perch of a whaling ship. <br /> <br />Winterson's writing is sensual and extraordinary, and it's absolute poetry. Here's an excerpt, with Silver thinking about Captain Scott in the Antarctic: \\"Not earth-bound any more, he could wing the dogs in a wind-ruff of fur, husky-haloed through two miles or so of gravity, then out, free, barking at the moon, half-wolf, half-tame, going home to the white planet he had seen shining in their orange eyes, paws hock-deep in snow.\\" Holy cow, is that beautiful. Try reading it out loud. <br /> <br />The narrator explains, \\"The true things are too big or too small, or in any case always the wrong size to fit the template called language. I know that. But I know something else too, because I was brought up to Lighthousekeeping. Turn down the daily noise and at first there is the relief of silence. And then, very quietly, as quiet as light, meaning returns.\\" Lovely.	2005-05-13

Diana, the Princess of Wales, is in the news again, with \\"new\\" videotaped interviews being shown on television seven years after her death in a car crash in a Paris tunnel. Although he isn't the one releasing the videotapes, Patrick Jephson, who served for six years as her first and only private secretary, has just released a new book, \\"Portraits of a Princess: Travels with Diana,\\" in which he reveals fascinating behind-the-scenes details of what it was like to work for and travel with the princess. He combines his text with photos by award-winning royal photographer Kent Gavin.<br /><br />The book includes 300 black and white or color photos of Diana, 150 of which were previously unpublished. There really are lots of photos here. The text is a sometimes emotional memoir written by someone who obviously admired her. The photos cover the range of her life in the public eye, from her first awkward experiments with fashion to her later, confident style, as she evolved \\"from Prince Charles's diffident consort into an independent, global force for good.\\" The author shows Diana as \\"ambassador\\" to people all over the world, from monarchs and world leaders to the lowliest on the street and in hospitals. He describes her as \\"an unbeatable combination of fashion and compassion.\\"<br /><br />But Jephson had writing help: Kent Gavin wrote the foreword, titled \\"The View from Inside the Press Pen.\\" There's a chapter called \\"Travels of a Royal Press Secretary\\" written by Dickie Arbiter. And there's another chapter on \\"Diana's Style\\" written by Ollie Picton-Jones, the fashion director for the Daily Mirror.<br /><br />Jephson ends the book with an epilogue titled \\"Did She Make a Difference?\\" Obviously, he thinks she did. This is a lovely gift for those royal-watchers among us who still can't quite believe she's gone.	2004-12-17

BRIDGING THE WORLD would make a wonderful gift for anyone with an interest in engineering or architecture, an armchair traveler or history buff, or anyone who just likes beautiful photography. Cortright is a retired American banker who just loves bridges. This is his third book filled with bridge photos, and he's obviously very good at his craft. The photos are gorgeous, displaying bridges from all over the world, with 306 clear, colorful photos from 28 countries and six continents. <br /> <br />The photography is exquisite -- you can see the individual cables, the shadows on the water or canyon beneath the structure, and the texture of the stones and other materials used in the bridge construction. The book arranges the bridges more or less chronologically or by length of span. The photos are divided by method of construction used in the bridge -- beam, arch, suspension, cable-stayed, aqueducts and special bridges. The book begins with structures built in ancient times and moves on to huge, modern works of art. To see several of the photos, visit [...] Strongly recommended, especially as a gift.	2004-12-17

Kennedy: The Mogul, the Mob, the Statesman, and the Making of an American Myth	Books	3	10	11	N	N	Pretty thorough lambasting of an unlikable character.	If you're a follower of the Kennedy saga, there may be little new material here in the biography, JOSEPH P. KENNEDY. But it's interesting and highly readable. It covers everyone from JPK's ancesters in Ireland to Caroline and John Jr.'s generation. Jackie comes off well. But there are a lot of unpleasant things about Rose I'd never heard before. And there are things I knew about but never knew the truth behind -- like the tragedy of Rosemary.<br />As I read the book, I thought he made statements that would be considered controversial. But as I read on, and looked at the notes and bibliography, I realized Mr. Schwarz did indeed appear to be well informed. It's oddly written, with some really long sentences and some anecdotes stuck in totally out of any time sequence. If only for the insights into the worlds of politics and Hollywood, it's well worth your time. And it's pretty enjoyable.	2003-10-09

HENRY AND EDSEL offers insight into the characters of Henry and Edsel Ford and what it was that compelled them. The book presents a strong sense of time and the Fords' presence in and contribution to the events around them. The book is filled with interesting anecdotes. The best part for me were the several chapters called &quot;rearview mirror&quot; -- accounts written by eyewitnesses  who recorded their version of important events: Edsel's death, the riots, etc. The author also introduced us to some of the hard workers and bright people Henry surrounded himself with in order to get to the top.

It starts off in the year 1887 with an interesting premise, and it moves steadily toward an exciting finish. The character of Thomas is more likable than last time, and his wife Charlotte, who doesn't have much to do in the first part of the book, becomes very active later, as does her sister Emily. And there are characters brought back from previous books. Along the way, because of Charlotte's unusual social circumstances and Thomas's profession, we learn some fascinating insights into the class system of that time and place.<br />The author is consistent in her ability to create a sense of place and character. In DEATH IN THE DEVIL'S ACRE the atmosphere is dark and moody, with a very unpleasant topic. But the book is well done and adds to the series.	2003-05-31

DEATH OF A SNOB may be the 4th in the Hamish Macbeth series -- I've lost count. It's coprighted 1991. The awkward relationship between Hamish and Priscilla contines. This is a real cozy in the old tradition, with a group brought together on an island. It's fun, short, and light, but also moody and dark, with some elements of a real \\"thriller\\" thrown in, along with some fun characters. Once again, Beaton has made the nasty one so nasty that I'd have wanted to kill that one myself!	2003-05-31

Sharon McCone is quite a bit like Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone (or vice versa), which is truly high praise from me. It's savvy, sexy, exciting stuff. McCone is way cool. EDWIN OF THE IRON SHOES is set mostly in an antique shop with the eerie \\"characters\\" of a headless mannequin named Clothilde and a little \\"boy\\" named Edwin who has strange iron shoes. The author creates only a sketchy sense of place, but a definite sense of character, with some really fun potental villains. A very interesting ultimate motive for the murder makes for a satisfying ending. I can see why this is such a popular series. I loved it!	2003-05-31

Its presentation is lovely and almost childlike at times. There are genuine mysteries to be solved here, but even though the individual stories are short, this is not &quot;mystery light.&quot; The author creates some really memorable characters and presents an interesting sense of place (with Africa's Kalahari as the background), but more like a soft, fuzzy dream than a detailed picture. This is a place where witch doctors rule, where cobras nonchalantly climb into cars. The author uses simple language full of wisdom. One chapter is titled &quot;Mma Ramotswe Thinks About the Land While Driving Her Tiny White Van to Francistown&quot; -- and that's exactly what it's about! Here's more: &quot;They taught us ... a language which is good for telling people what to do. There are many words for push, take, shove, carry, load, and no words for love, or happiness, or the sounds which birds make in the morning.&quot; and &quot;So for many years, nothing at all happened. It was a good system of government, because most people want nothing to happen. That is the problem with governments these days. They want to do things all the time; they are always very busy thinking of what things they can do next. That is not what people want. People want to be left alone to look after their cattle.&quot; READ THIS BOOK! It's full of joy. I'm going to read the next in the series.	2003-03-18

Here we are in the Cotswolds, but this is a completely different view of the Cotswolds than that of M.C. Beaton's Agatha Raisin books, which are also a lot of fun. There's not much sense of place here, but a nice sense of community. A nicely hateable victim and a nice list of colorful suspects. A light mystery that reads easily and has some really interesting moments. I don't quite get the spirit of Aunt Dimity thing. This is my first Aunt Dimity book, and in this one Aunt D. really wasn't needed. And I can't figure out why a spirit in her &quot;position&quot; wouldn't know everything -- including who committed the crime. Ah, well. Suspending disbelief makes life much more interesting.

It's very reminiscent of the Diana Mott Davidson culinary mysteries -- and not just because of the recipes. The style is very similar. I'm not sure which number this is in the Faith Fairchild series, but it's copyrighted 1998. And it's my first. It's about the theft of antiques, and one dead body leads to another as our protagonist tries to recover some of her stolen property. The characters are fun and believable. The author creates no sense of place at all, geographically, but does create a sense of community. Not the most satisfying mystery I've ever read, but entertaining. <br />I'm in possesion of two different versions of this book. To help you with your purchasing decision, here's a comparison: One has a green cover with a gold letter opener. This is an Avon Twilight book, first printed in 1999. At the end it has excerpts of about two pages each from five other mystery series. The other is an Avon Book, first printed March 2001. It has a gray cover with red and black letters. It has larger print (but not &quot;large print&quot;), so the book is thicker. It has excerpts of about two pages each from nine other books in this same series.	2003-03-17

I believe MISTLETOE MAN is the 9th in the China Bayles series that began with THYME OF DEATH. This is one of my favorite mystery authors -- she always creates strong charcterization and a good sense of place. By now each visit to Pecan Springs is a real treat for me, like visiting old, loving friends. And loving is really the theme of this tightly woven story. Loving sisters, loving an old \\"crazy\\" woman, loving spouses, loving children, loving pets, loving friends, loving life. This is one of the best examples of how the mystery itself is not the most important part of the book. It's the development of the ongoing story of the characters that keeps the series fresh and alive. In this case, a life-threatening illness brings out new feelings and responses in our familiar charcters. A lovely ending. One of the best books in the series so far.	2003-03-17

Since I began reading these Hamish Macbeth mysteries out of order, it's given me a bit of perspective. In DEATH OF A GOSSIP, the early Hamish (c 1985) is funnier and more awkward, and Priscillla is even more fragile, airy, feminine, and perfect. The whole thing is a little more edgy than some later ones. Beaton creates really unlikable characters -- in this case, the gossip columnist is truly obnoxious. I would have killed her myself. But, unlike some other Beaton books, there's no sense of place this time -- that is, no sense of picturing exactly where everybody was. I always love Beaton's sense of humor. I laughed from page one: \\"People who travel up here to the wilds of Scotland expect to be instructed by some great hairy Rob Roy, making jokes about saxpence and saying it's a braw bricht moonlicht nicht and lang may your lum reek and ghastly things like that.\\" All in all, a so-so mystery, but a very fun time with Hamish.	2003-03-17

This time he's searching for a bizarre serial killer who seems to be living in the past, presenting the heads of his slain enemies as \\"war trophies\\" in tribute to his lord. Once again, as in SHINJU, Rowland gives us a terrific read -- more thriller than whodunit. And she gives us a lot of info on society and everyday life in medieval Japan. She creates an AMAZING sense of place, combining the societal info with her excellent descriptions: \\"A haze of pale foliage added brightness and life to the city's drab brown thatched or tiled roofs. Cherry trees, in full blossom now, spread rosy clouds over the banks of the many canals, formed solid bands of radiant color along the broad, muddy Sumida River, and turned the hills beyond the castle into a breathtaking wash of pink and green. Their fragrance scented the air with an elusive, poignant sweetness. In the distance, high above the city to the west, rose Mount Fuji's serene, snowcapped peak.\\"<br />I found the detailed sex scenes a bit distasteful, but they did contribute to the sense of character and to the tension. These books are a tremendous amount of work. Rowland can be very proud. Great entertainment. These books are very well done.	2003-03-17

I always enjoy Adamson's books, and by my calculations A CAT WITH NO CLUE is book number 19 in the Alice Nestleton series that began with A CAT IN THE MANGER. This one begins splendidly, with murder that affects Alice very personally. The suspense moves along well as she gets involved in an old unsolved tragedy. But at some point it lost me. When I finished the book I had to go back and re-read parts of it because I didn't quite get a couple of things. I always count on Adamson for a brief, satisfying mystery. But this one I did not find satisfying. A couple of unanswered questions are a couple too many for me. Ah, well. It's still a comfy cozy, but not one of her best.

In this, the third book in the Rei Shimura series that began with THE SALARYMAN'S WIFE, we attend ikebana (flower arranging) classes with Rei and her aunt and meet a lot of interesting characters.

I enjoyed THE FLOWER MASTER, but I kept feeling that there was something left out -- not enough detail, action, whatever. I loved the first two. Maybe it's just me. Try it for yourself. It doesn't discourage me from wanting to read the next one, though. I love whatever view of the culture Massey gives us, along with her fine ability to create a sense of place.	2003-02-03

I've read a couple other Maeve Binchy books and was not impressed, but I remember seeing the movie CIRCLE OF FRIENDS in about 1995 and liked it, so I tried this one. I LOVED it!!! I immediately became involved in the lives of Benny and her friends in Ireland as they start college in Dublin. They come from different family backgrounds and social strata. There's hope, love, hatred, suspense, betrayal, surprise, death, and mostly friendship. Everything you could want in an excellent read. (The anal-retentive editor in me kept wanting to pick up a red pencil to fix the sentences that had no verbs, were run-ons, or had verbs that didn't match the subject. But when the story's good enough that those things don't really bother me, I know it's a good story!) Totally engaging -- almost 600 pages, and I didn't want it to end! I could hardly put it down. Wonderful! Don't miss it!	2003-02-03

The establishment in HOTEL HONOLULU has 80 rooms and the book has 80 chapters, one for each room. But it doesn't work out to 80 different stories; they're all intertwined -- some more so than others. The book is filled with bizarre, eccentric characters and a LOT of unpleasantness and distasteful stuff. I enjoyed the later pages much more, as Theroux got more philosophical: &quot;It seemed to me that Peewee was there to remind me that my father was not dead. Seeing my father in him, I grieved less, and I saw that even here in Hawaii -- older and far from home -- I was still a part of some great cycle and my father was nearby. It helped me to see my father in him; it calmed me; it eased my pain.&quot;<br />Here -- take a trip: &quot;It was one of those brilliant orchidaceous days on the North Shore of Oahu, under the towering palms. A silky breeze lisped through the needles of the ironwoods edging Sunset Beach. The cliffs behind us were as dark and leafy as spinach. ... Down at the beach, a man was casting into the surf, working his fishing rod like a coach whip. The breeze carried a scent of flowers.&quot; I thought reading the book might be a fun vacation, but it wasn't so much fun as thought-provoking. But it was fun, too.	2003-02-03

Bennett gives us two totally different stories -- one fiction, one true. In &quot;CLOTHES,&quot; the characters lose absolutely everything and turn out to have surprising reactions to the crime. It leaves you thinking. Yet the characters are almost cartoon-like, as if it's all a dream. In &quot;LADY,&quot; Bennett presents one of the most interesting characters in literature -- definitely unlikable, but really fascinating.<br />What does it mean to have nothing? What do you have left when you have &quot;nothing&quot;? Bennett's a great comic writer, but I wouldn't say hilarity abounds in either of these stories. Rather, there's more subtle humor, irony. Warning: DO NOT read the introduction first. It gives away the major plot points, which are most delightful only when they sneak up on you as you read the stories themselves. Whatever you do, don't miss &quot;THE LADY IN THE VAN.&quot;	2002-12-16

This is a challenging experiment in word play written entirely in letter (epistle) format. Plot-wise, as the letters of the alphabet disappear from the monument, the citizens are ordered to stop using them -- in writing OR in speech. (The speech part fails me -- you don't use letters in speech unless you spell aloud. But for the sake of the story, it increases the frustrating need to comunicate.) I would compare the plot to that of &quot;The Emperor Has No Clothes&quot; -- that is, what's real and what isn't, and who is willing to stand up and admit it? ELLA MINNOW PEA becomes an interesting look at what a fanatic oligarchy can do to a society if the pople don't fight back.<br />Because this was sold as a play on words, I thought it was going to be much more fun. But quite frankly it was pretty heavy plodding in the beginning. I do applaud the author for his attempt at word play, but I wish he'd been more consistent. For example, at one point, character Mittie decides she's going to make up for the loss of some letters by overusing the others (&quot;Robbed of two letters, I now chooooose to overuuuuse the twenty-four which remaaaain&quot;), but then she never does again. Had she kept that up, it would have been fun and something to set her apart. There was otherwise nothing distinguishing these &quot;characters.&quot;<br />I initially felt that the writing was terribly awkward -- why does the author make it sound as if the people had swallowed a thesaurus and spewed it forth in their unreal letters to each other? But a couple of days later, as the story was still swimming in my head, I realized, no -- the beginning establishes how much the people cherish the words. They play with them, eat, sleep, and practically bathe in them, making their loss even more painful. And if they did NOT have such a familiarity with the use of alternate words, they couldn't have continued communicating as long as they did. They had to leave their home, their country, because they couldn't give up their ability to communicate. An interesting read that keeps coming back to my mind. (Extra fun: the new names for the months, subtly shown at the top of each letter.)	2002-12-16

This fascinating historical fiction only starts as a murder mystery -- then it takes us on a thrill ride as we explore the society, customs, and class clashes of medieval Japan. Well written, well put together, well edited. The best news is that SHINJU is the first of a series featuring investigator Sano Ichiro. I could NOT put it down! Rowland develops a real sense of place and complete characters with souls. Here's what you get: devotion and betrayal, the elegance of the tea ceremony and the degradation of a medieval prison, the subjugation of women, the rules of society and family, a funeral, an execution, Edo Castle, a brothel, and characters that range from blackmailers and prostitutes to the shogun himself. You'll even learn a few phrases in Japanese!	2002-12-16

In this, the second book in the series (the first was MISS ZUKAS AND THE LIBRARY MURDERS), Helma the librarian is trying to organize her mostly Lithuanian classmates into having a 20th-year high school reunion, with little or no help from her best friend Ruth, the artist. Once again, Dereske gives us a fast-paced thriller that's hard to put down. She develops the characters introduced in the first book and adds a touch of romance, scandal, threats, anonymous letters, fog, and, of course, murder. MISS ZUKAS AND THE ISLAND MURDERS is a fun, old-fashioned cozy set on an island where murders and threats abound.	2002-12-16

NIGHTMARE IN SHINING ARMOR happily continues the Den of Antiquity series. In fact, it's one of the smoothest and most fun in the comic mystery series that began with LARCENY AND OLD LACE. The rip-roaring plot is lots of fun. The book is easy to read, flows quickly and smoothly, and has a fullness and a completeness to it. In other words, it's a satisfying read. But a surprise plot turn makes you wonder -- is this the end of the series? But no! Check out the next one: SPLENDOR IN THE GLASS. Nicely done.	2002-12-16

Short and sweet and jam-packed with fun, DEATH OF A HUSSY is the fifth in the series of Hamish Macbeth mysteries. There are some really colorful characters here.

Want to know how it felt to be &quot;that age&quot; in 1970? to think you MAY be drafted? you or your friends MAY be sent to Viet Nam? and MAY not return? what it feels like to have the rug pulled out from under you? Where does reality go when war intervenes? Who's right in a wrong war? What do you do when your choice becomes a mistake? THE YEAR THAT TREMBLED is a lovely book, with some beautiful use of language. There's a little awkwardness, but the elegant portions really overcame the other. It will make you think.	2002-12-16

According to the list in the book, this book (copyright 1984) is the fifth in the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series. And it's the best so far. BLUEGATE FIELDS is complex in both plot and characterization, with distasteful subjects reminiscent of a \\"Law & Order: SVU\\" episode. Set in Victorian London at the time when telephones were just beginning to show up in some of the \\"better\\" homes, it presents a very strong sense of place and time. The character of Pitt becomes much more filled-out. I liked the way he and Charlotte worked together this time. The plot has tentacles. Hard to put down! A GREAT read!	2002-12-16

There's something for everybody in MALICE DOMESTIC 9, this collected homage to Agatha Christie. Some of the stories are based on Christie's plots, some on her characters, and some just contain references to her works. Of the 14 stories, a couple are dark, some are outright hilarious, and almost all are in the cozy tradition. Besides Christie's own &quot;The Case of the Discontented Soldier,&quot; there are stories by Robert Barnard, Jan Burke, Kate Charles, Marjorie Eccles, Teri Holbrook, Gwen Moffat, Marcia Talley, Dorothy Cannell, Charles Todd, Ann Granger, Walter Satterthwait, Carolyn Wheat, and Susan Moody. (There is no story by Joan Hess -- just a tiny introduction.) This is a really fine collection. I've read some of these first-rate stories several times already. These anthologies are an excellent investment!	2002-12-16

THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS is this year's Sabuda masterpiece to be added to his growing list of amazing works. To go along with Clement Moore's famous poem, Sabuda gives us eleven gorgeous, complex pop-ups that really DO pop up. At the same time, it's really rather elegant. Most of the pop-ups are in simple white with silver embellishments. This is SO much fun! Santa and the reindeer quite literally jump right out at you. Look for subtle things, like the minute hand moving on the clock, and the window shade going up. And at the end you get a whole little village. WARNING: This book is NOT toddler-proof. This is a work of art. By all means, share it with the children. They'll love it! But keep it just far enough away from their eager fingers. Do NOT miss this one!	2002-12-16

THE MOOR starts well and ends well, but it's way too long -- with a lot of seemingly repetitive sequences (how many baths? how many walks on the moor?), at 369 pages I was begging for it to be over. I think a good editor could have cut out almost 100 pages. This is the fourth entry in the Mary Russell series, and Holmes is much less active this time. King continues to create a definite sense of time and place, and excellently weaves an eery mood. All the travel on the moor definitely makes you feel cold and wet. The plot provides great fun in that it revives &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; story in detail. You do NOT need to read the previous books in the series to understand THE MOOR. But quite frankly I enjoyed the previous books much more.	2002-10-30

Her style reminds me of Lydia Adamson's. So, if you like this one, check out Adamson's &quot;cat&quot; books. This one is all plot -- it has almost no sense of place. In fact, a couple of times I lost track of where everybody was. And the many characters were rather cartoonish and not too deeply drawn. But that's O.K. It was still a lot of fun. Babson's books are NOT a series -- each stands alone, so you can start with any one of them. I'm really enjoying them.	2002-10-30

UNPRINTABLE is an expertly crafted mystery-thriller that reads much faster than its 381 pages would indicate. Kaewert brings back her interesting characters and combines love, envy, obsession, and violence with a plot as big as the EU, an election in Britain, more fascinating printing history, geography, ecology, and more!

MISS ZUKAS AND THE LIBRARY MURDERS is the first in a series of mysteries featuring a librarian in the coastal area of Bellehaven, Washington. This book is copyrighted 1994, and the author has added about a book a year since then. A fun and fast-paced thriller with wonderful, fresh, multi-dimensional characters and delightful plot twists.

It's hilariously funny, yet there are also some sobering, disturbing moments. A very American story set in a Midwestern small town, with lots of eccentric characters. Kimmel's use of language is just beautiful. Her descriptions bring an instant picture to mind. Here's the intro to one character: &quot;[She] was short and whippet thin with dark hair bleached platinum and the skin of a career smoker. She was very tanned.&quot; Can't you just see her? And Zippy's dogs: &quot;Tiger, who was some sort of beagle-shaped zeppelin with unusual bowel function and tragically short legs&quot; and Kai, who &quot;turned out to be the color of coins falling from a winter sky.&quot;<br />This is not so much a story as a series of postcards from the author's youth. I fell in love with Zippy and her book-loving mother and almost-perfect father. It's a book to read again and again. A pure joy!	2002-10-03

PRIME CUT is perhaps the eighth in the series that started with CATERING TO NOBODY. And this is one of the best. A good, solid story with a lot of side stories for color. It's a bit too long for me, at 368 pages, but it held my interest throughout. This enjoyable series just keeps getting better. It's not essential, but it will help if you read them in order -- esp. in the case of this one, because several characters show up from past books and play significant roles. (But you'll get by just fine either way.) This time there are lots of goings-on with Goldy and her friends, and also lots behind the scenes and in historical flashbacks. There are plenty of nogoodnik characters to spice up the action. Why was there a break-in at the museum? What's that got to do with the dead guy? Will Goldy be able to save her catering business? Ha!

This light and easy-to-read cozy reminded me a bit of Christie in the atmosphere it built up. About a third of the way into the book, it turns creepy and more interesting. Good premise, nice structure, likeable characters (mostly mystery writers!) -- and I love the cats! I wasn't too happy with the outcome -- I thought MY theory of who did it would have been more interesting! But still worthwhile for the nice, fun visit to a friendly village of eccentrics.

This series is just the ticket for mystery buffs -- esp. those who like a bit of vicarious traveling thrown in. Want to live in Japan for a while?<br />This is the second in the series that started with THE SALARYMAN'S WIFE.

LEFT BEHIND is poorly written, but it's easy to read and surprisingly hard to put down. The text is scripturally sound according to what I was always taught in church regarding \\"the end times.\\" The book blasts the reader with too much negativity, but that goes with the territory. I read LEFT BEHIND, the first in the series, to see why the series is so popular -- and I found out! When you close the book you're ready to start the next one! The authors make no apology for their blatant proseletyzing. That's the book's whole purpose. It successfully incorporates actual Biblical prophecy (as the authors interpret it) with \\"What if\\" scenarios. It's all very cleverly done, and is at times tense and page-turning. I'm assured that subsequent books in the series are better written. The authors did what they set out to do. And I must say, in the annals of Christian fiction this is the best at what it tried to achieve.	2002-08-30

THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MY MOTHER is beautifully written. It's not about her mother at all, but about the search for knowledge about this woman that she never met.

It's funny, but not as funny as I expected, having read some of the Series of Unfortunate Events books. The old pictures are hilarious, though -- where did he ever find them? As I looked back through the book I realized that LEMONY SNICKET: THE UNAUTHORIZED AUTOBIOGRAPHY is a book you can read over and over to try to solve the \\"clues.\\" Big on detail, short on understandable explanation. Even the index is in the hilarious circular dead-end style. The presentation is extremely clever: The book comes with three covers! The reversible dust jacket is a real hoot. The artwork of the entire book is very inventive. The book turns into a newspaper, a scrapbook, a transcript, etc. If you liked the series, do read this book.

This is a lovely, personal account of the author's many trips to England. But this is not just a travelogue -- I would not recommend it for planning your trip. (I always like maps and pictures in my travel books, and there are neither here.) In fact, it's less a travel book than a peek at her very personal diary, looking at England from a unique, gentle and fun perspective as she talked about herself, her marriages, and her family. MY LOVE AFFAIR WITH ENGLAND made me very much want to go see the England she described. She obviously loves the place. My favorite part: the footpaths!

I appreciate all the finish work put into this, which is all too rare these days in publishing. Everything about the book is finely polished. And it is beautifully put together.

What an experience, to look at life and death from this whole new perspective. I hated to see it end. In fact, I found myself crying. I read it basically in one sitting -- I simply couldn't put it down. Such a good read! I can't get over how excellent this book is -- it's a fine, fine work of art that will last a long time in the literary world.

It has a little of everything: adventure, romance, love, death threats, information (about the publishing industry), a chase, ghosts. Cool! Thoroughly enjoyable. It's a complex, clever, easy to read page-turner. Be warned: There are a LOT of characters. This is proving to be a fantastically good series. If you haven't already, go back and read the first, UNSOLICITED.	2002-08-30
US	52778876	RM3S2L83RZC4O	0449212858	651828719	Rutland Place	Books	4	4	7	N	N	Almost perfect for the genre.	RUTLAND PLACE is dark and moody with an excellent sense of period and locale, as are all the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt books. And this time Perry has given us especially interesting characters. This book involves more than one mystery, with unusual solutions. It is not always the expected thing that happens in Anne Perry's books. That's one reason I like them. Thomas and Charlotte Pitt work separately and together this time, in about equal shares. There's even some light-hearted fun. And at 217 pages it's a good, quick read.	2002-06-07
US	52778876	R5M3ILEA2JBM4	0446310786	994527755	To Kill a Mockingbird	Books	5	2	4	N	N	One of the best-writen books of all time.	TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is possibly one of those books that you thought (as I did) you'd read because you saw the movie. Take no chances -- pick it up and read it now! This is truly an American masterpiece. If you've seen the movie, its plot is faithful to the book. But you need to experience the subtle dances Harper Lee displays in her writing -- how she interweaves social \\"conventions\\" with the emotions and reactions of children who don't understand \\"the rules\\" because their wonderful father, whom they had always taken for granted, never taught them how to be racists or snobs. The characters are so complete I felt I could reach out and touch them. The simple narrative that explains the title is truly beautiful and becomes a heart-piercing metaphor that has stayed with me. People have written volumes about how wonderful this book is. Just do yourself a favor and read it!	2002-06-07

Reading SELF MATTERS is a worthwhile exercise for anyone who wants to know more about himself and/or why we see life the way we do. I recommend reading the book slowly -- maybe one chapter a week -- and definitely doing the assignments. You will discover so much about yourself! It may not change your life, but I'll bet it lets you look at yourself and those around you in a different light, if only for a short while. Example: Labeling. When Phil explained labeling and asked us to list all the labels others had put on us and we had put on ourselves, I thought, \\"Oh, sure -- I'll come up with maybe five.\\" I filled the entire page and started writing up the sides of the paper! And a few days later the really deep-seated ones were still finding their way to the surface! <br />Great passages to think about: \\"A distorted life feels more and more natural the longer you live it.\\" \\"What kind of a friend are you to yourself, throughout the day?\\" \\"It boggles the mind to think about all the jobs people do that they're unsuited for: jobs that threaten their mental stability, their emotional well-being, and as a result their physical health -- jobs they took in order to be 'safe.' \\"<br />If you just read this straight through without doing the work, I can't believe you'll think it's worthwhile. This book is only as good as the time YOU put into it! For a good deal of insight into yourself, I recommend the book. But it can't really take the place of professional help if you are deeply troubled.	2002-06-07

The glutton is immensely repulsive, and by the time the death occurs, you'll be ready to commit the murder yourself! I really like Hamish Macbeth more and more, and there's a fun interplay between Hamish and Priscilla. But I'm reading the series out of order, so I get confused by their on again/off again relationship. And that's a truly interesting element, so do try to read them in order. (I believe this is number 8 in a series that starts with DEATH OF A GOSSIP.) At 168 pages, this is a good, quick read -- short and a lot of fun.	2002-06-07

And I laughed out loud many times, but it's not a humorous book. It is SO well written it amazes me. The characters have so many sides to their personalities that, by the end, I felt as if I knew them. The main character, Elissa, was frustrating, aggravating, perplexing, and irritating. But I've got to tell you, there were occasionally things she did or said that I absolutely identified with on a startling level. My favorite scene: a confrontation in the office, a brilliantly written dance between foes -- the tension had me on the edge of my chair, and I felt a real vicarious pleasure in every verbal jab she gave him. It was excellent! But I found the ending totally unsatisfying. To be fair, I don't suppose it could have ended any other way, but Elissa just continued to irritate me! There are some odd time spans: 50 pages are spent on one night and then two years pass in about three pages. And there's NOT MUCH PLOT! Be warned! It's mostly dialogue, but that is amazingly real! I marked at least seven passages for my quotation collection. Here are a few: \\"I am stuck between the life I live and the life I am unable to imagine.\\" \\"Work isn't what I do.... It's what happens to me.\\" \\"I am wasting my life in an orgy of dissatisfaction.\\"	2002-06-07

The introduction to this book describes the story as a classic tall tale and gives some historical background information on the story. There's no mama here, as in THE FIVE CHINESE BROTHERS, which is not a prequel, but is basically the same story. This one (7 brothers) is SO much better than the other! There's more action here, and the beautiful, colorful illustrations are wonderful and have movement and detail. I think the two books cost the same. I'd get this one!	2002-05-20

SIX-DINNER SID is a black cat who gets whatever he wants -- most of the time. It's a simple, funny story you can read over and over. The illustrations are marvelous, with bright and pastel colors, and lovely detail in the flowers, etc. You can even see the cat's individual hairs and whiskers. The streets look somehow European (the book was originally published in the UK, so I suppose that's where it's set). I love the street scene on pages 3 and 4 so much I'd like to frame it! As for the wonderful cat, the pictures really capture his personality, the angles cats love to contort into, and the idiosyncracies of catdom. How fun!	2002-05-10

THOMAS'S RAILWAY WORD BOOK is another in the seemingly endless parade of Thomas paperbacks, but I'm not complaining! The fact is, they're inexpensive and make a wonderful collection that encourages your Thomas fan to read. This one has vivid cartoon-like illustrations in primary colors with lots going on in the background to talk about. But there is NO story -- zip. The words are connected with what they represent, with arrows (coach, suitcase). The words are used in sentences, but make no plot. Still, my Thomas fans like me to read it over and over anyway, because I ask them \\"Where's the fireman?\\" or point to the train #5 and ask \\"Which one is this?\\" or \\"What's the helicopter's name?\\" I also make up mini-stories that use the words, and even though they're different every time, the kids will say \\"Read it again!\\" Or I ask them to tell me what's going on in the picture. That's a great mental exercise.	2002-05-10

THE REPTILE ROOM is the second in the series of unfortunate events about the three Baudelaire orphans that began with THE BAD BEGINNING. These books are SO depressing they're hilarious. Once I start one, I can't put it down. While we can often see who the bad guy really is and what's going to happen, it's like watching a scary movie and screaming at the screen, \\"Look out! He's right behind you!\\" but the characters in extreme peril can't hear you. The author is so funny, and so sly. And he paints his pictures of gloom so well. Bravo! And the creepy crawly snakes!

Reading an Agatha book like AGATHA RAISIN AND THE WELLSPRING OF DEATH is like eating chocolate-covered jalapeno peppers while drinking grapefruit juice, followed by a nice, hot cup of sweetened tea. You don't see how all the different elements could go together, but they do! This is about the 7th in the series that features Agatha and her neighbor James. All the traditional Agatha elements are here: the cozy Cotswolds, the quirky local characters, some \\"incomers\\" to stir things up, James, Roy. And it's so funny I laughed out loud several times, usually at Agatha's biting sense of humor. (\\"That woman has halitosis of the soul,\\" said Agatha.) I'm telling you, Agatha really grows on you. Where I once said she'd never be my best friend, I just love her now. And where else in literary circles do we find attractive women in their 50s with a hot sex life? Go, Agatha!	2002-05-10

This is one of the best anthologies of poetry I've ever found. The purpose: Bring together words from women of all cultures, all ages, all corners of the world. Here are young women, old women, fat women, starving women, lives touched by peace, war, spiritual joy, physical abuse, passion, motherhood, loss. There are beautiful, haunting words here. There are cold, hard, brutal images here. If you're a woman who complains about feminists, please read this book and try to understand what women have had to go through so that you could be where you are today: free to complain. If only to have a copy of Sojourner Truth's immortal &quot;Ain't I a Woman?&quot; speech from 1852, this book would be worth the price. Read this book for the incredible messages here.

About 95% of DIANA: PORTRAIT OF A PRINCESS is photos, with only minimal narrative. And almost all of the photos were taken by Fincher, who was a royal photographer. The pictures are fantastic -- a couple just take my breath away. How could this exquisite person be gone? (see page 95) Surely, Diana was one of the most photogenic persons who ever lived. Here in the photos we watch her grow up, make fashion choices (not all good!) to find her own image, and create her own life just in time to lose it. Sometimes she looked a bit like a tired, frumpy housewife. In other pictures she's just perfection. The heavy, oversize book is divided into three parts: For Love, For Loyalty, For Liberty. The printing quality of the photos is EXCELLENT. This was a beautiful gift from my beloved niece, who knows me well. I must say, it makes an excellent gift. This book is one to keep and treasure.	2002-05-10

Here's Franklin with his friends in FRANKLIN GOES TO DAY CAMP. It's an excellent way to introduce kids to the idea of day camp and to the concept of journaling. There are word games and puzzles, a maze, and a board game, all surrounded by beautiful, bright illustrations. It's also good for a child who's sick or stuck indoors on a rainy day. I suggest using a pencil on the puzzles so you can erase and do them again. Or cover the page with plastic and write on that. The affordable book works on several levels: story, journal, games.	2002-05-10

I SPY YEAR ROUND CHALLENGER is filled with 12 pictures -- one for each month. Every puzzle is very different from the others. These clever photographs have beautiful colors but they're sometimes blurry or dark and hazy, and it's hard to see what's what. I wasn't always sure what I was looking for. I even believe there's a typo, making you look for one thing when it should be something else. In a couple of cases you can see only a tiny part of the thing you're supposed to find. And the extra credit riddles need to be on a foldout page so you can refer to them without flipping back and forth. Still, it's a beautiful, clever book and a lot of fun.	2002-05-10

I have no idea how Chinese the tale of THE FIVE CHINESE BROTHERS really is. But it takes the form of a myth or fairy tale. It could be scary, I suppose, but all fairy tales are scary. This is a fun story, and I thought it was unique. Then I discovered the book THE SEVEN CHINESE BROTHERS, which is NOT a sequel but is based on the same story (see review of that one). The differences: this one has a mama, has simple black and orange illustrations, and an older copyright date of 1938. This is a nice fairy tale, but I recommend the other, more modern and colorful, book more highly.	2002-05-10
US	52778876	R192IKPX6ZLW19	0679000240	683319767	Worlds to Imagine	Books	4	1	1	N	N	The perfect appetizer for the armchair traveler.	Watch grizzlies from a &quot;floating lumber camp&quot; or follow a silverback mountain gorilla in the mists of the Ugandan rainforest. The tiny snapshots in WORLDS TO IMAGINE are here merely to whet your appetite. There are only a few pictures -- usually only two -- of each place. The descriptions are poetic (sometimes overly so). But I really enjoyed the language and the mental meanderings. Most coveted getaway: green blue sea of Bora Bora. Biggest disappointment: only two pictures of Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Least desirable vacation destination: Antarctica.<br />The author is really good at creating verbal imagery to make a mental picture. From Bali, he brings us the sound of  &quot;tintinnabulary gongs and xylophones.&quot; And here's an example from Burma: &quot;Ahead, Mandalay is chockablock with meditation centers and nipple-shaped stupas that milk your attention amidst bonging temple gongs and chow lines of saffron-robed monks seeking handouts.&quot;<br />Still and all, it's a travel guide, conveniently listing hotels, contacts, phone numbers, prices, etc. at the back of the book. I suggest you keep this book by your bed and read only one at a time right before sleep. Pleasant journeys!	2002-05-10

Albert is SUCH a good writer, her books are a true pleasure to read -- and hard to put down. This one may be the most fun so far, as the wacky women work together to solve the multi-layered mystery while China and McQuaid prepare for their possibly doomed wedding. I look forward to my visits to Pecan Springs, Texas. And I appreciate her little herb-related quotes, myths, and recipes. I've never actually made anything from a recipe in these books, but I must say Ruby's Lemonade with Lavender and Rosemary sounds like heaven on earth. And what my objection was in the last book was that McQuaid did all the work and called all the shots -- this time the very competent ladies -- with China back in charge -- do it all. And it's a lot of fun.	2002-05-10

I picked this book out because of the beautiful photography and the clever way objects were inserted into miniature settings. The 12 pictures in I SPY TREASURE HUNT are beautiful and fascinating to pore over. Sometimes the photographs are a bit blurry or hazy, though, which made me wonder if I was missing something. I wasn't always sure what I was looking for. Or you only see a tiny part of the thing you're supposed to find.

I knew before picking up STUPID WHITE MEN that Moore was anti-W. I thought there would be a lot of laughs here, mixed with a lot of statistics. I was right. I laughed out loud at his humor and was outraged at the 2000 election and the Republican criminal activity. And then Moore dropped the other shoe -- the facts on Pres. Clinton and how the Democratic Party has severely let us down, too, largely through incompetence and greed. Besides the election, Moore has taken on corporate greed, racism, schools, the environment, how men can avoid extinction, prisons, and a lot of other seemingly unrelated topics. Fascinating and well documented. Mike's still bitter, but he's working it out in some very interesting ways. This is a really compelling and moving read. And he gives the reader a lot of ideas for volunteerism and for political and community action. If this doesn't spur you to action, nothing will! Bring back one person, one vote!	2002-05-10

POOH'S EASTER EGG HUNT gives the kids a simple story that's easy to follow, with all of their Pooh friends along for the ride. The pictures have lovely bright colors. And the words are really big for young readers. The Step into Reading (this is a step 1 book) series is such a great idea for kids. There's an introduction here explaining the Step into Reading books program. Step 1 is for preschool to grade 1 (approx.).

If you haven't read a Kinsey Millhone book, PLEASE do yourself a favor and pick one up. They don't have to be read in order, but starting with A IS FOR ALIBI and proceeding through will make sure you don't miss one. N IS FOR NOOSE is an almost-perfect book. The mystery -- well, wow! -- I don't want to give anything away. The thing is, it doesn't matter to me whom she's chasing or who's chasing her. Grafton is so skilled at her craft that I found myself holding my breath, literally on the edge of my chair. And how she puts the reader &quot;in place&quot; while reading made me so homesick for California! Here she creates a community away from her hometown of Santa Teresa (based on Santa Barbara). It's so REAL! I can still see the town in my head, along with the realistic characters. There are no cardboard cutouts here -- these characters breathe. There aren't enough words of praise for Sue Grafton -- Excellent!! Kinsey has become the definitive female detective -- and with good reason. I hope Sue keeps writing books until she's 120 years old. But by then we'll run out of letters of the alphabet -- so then what?!	2002-05-10

I'm not sure the story made sense in LITTLE ENGINES CAN DO BAD THINGS, but the Thomas fans will still like it. Its pictures are in bright primary colors, but it uses simplistic drawings rather than the Thomas photographs of the other Britt Allcroft Thomas books. And there's nothing in the background of the pictures to talk about with the kids. We like to read a book over and over and sometimes stop and discuss every picture, so nothing to talk about is a drawback. This is one of those great Thomas paperbacks that are inexpensive, making it easy to collect lots of them.	2002-05-10

And the brightly colored illustrations are really funny. The nameless cat should be called Mischief (another fun thing to do with the child: find names for the cat).

These 12 pictures puzzles are beautiful to look out and ageless to figure out. In a picture puzzle, clear photography and faultless printing are essential. CAN YOU SEE WHAT I SEE? is the best I've ever seen. With this one there's very little of the trying to guess \\"what is that blurry thing?\\" that you get in other picture puzzle books. And it's clear what you're looking for. One nice thing too is that the list of things to find is right on the page with the picture -- no flipping back and forth to other pages. This is so much fun that after a friend saw my book she went and ordered one for herself, and when her niece saw hers and wanted one of her own, she got her one, too. I'm telling you, this is really fun -- and addictive. Whether you look at it alone or with a group, you'll have a good time! Makes a great ice breaker.	2002-05-10

She came up with these gorgeous, fascinating designs that are so lovely, you'll find yourself staring at each for a long time. The stitching: so original. The photography: catches every detail, each stitch, the texture of the fabric. The printing: the color matching is so superb, it should win a prize. The poetry: Here I'm not handing out any prizes, but it is fun to read. (It's recommended for ages 5 and up.) Here's a bit I found especially delightful, from \\"Misplaced?\\":<BR>\\"In a mass of wild confusion flowers bloom in great profusion, brilliant dazzling bold infusion, pink-blue purple stimulation, red-gold-yellow conflagration, rousing raucous celebration, stirring us to jubilation, echoing the exultation of their bright and vibrant show!\\"<br />It's a short book; there are only about 22 quilts in the whole thing. (The theme is the seasons of the year.) She talks about the making of the quilts at the back of the book. My thought is that this combination of the visual and poetic can stir the imagination. Get your children to try to match up the pieces of fabric within the pictures and from one to another.	2002-05-10

THE IRISH MANOR HOUSE MURDER is the second in the series of Torrey Tunet mysteries that began with THE IRISH COTTAGE MURDER. And this one's another page turner, just like the first. There are lots of plot twists again. This series has climbed to the top five of my favorites. But I did NOT like the fact that the lover from the last book had already been replaced with no explanation. I like to think of series characters having lives that continue when I'm not reading the books. The sense of time here seems distorted. I really love the subtle stuff -- esp. Torrey's knowlege of language and words (because she's a translator) and her instinct for seeing beyond what she sees. These remind me of Kinsey Millhone (high praise indeed).	2002-04-26

THE SALARYMAN'S WIFE is the first entry in this new series featuring Rei Shimura as an American teaching English in Japan. In this one she's on vacation, giving us a neat glimpse at leisure life in Japan. Massey's easy style makes this a joy to read. The book offers a nice little list of characters at the front, in case we get mixed up before the end of this 424-page monster. (Yes, it's too long!) But I was only confused by two of the characters, and only briefly. So don't worry about the Asian names. The book has a bit of everything: violence, romance, a good basic whodunit, some comic and some seedy characters, and a really cool heroine. And it has some VERY sexy moments! I'd call it flirtatious and seductive. I really want to read the next one!! FYI, this book won the Agatha Award for 1997.	2002-04-26

TREE OF DREAMS is not my favorite Lynn Andrews book -- and I've read and loved most of them. That's not to say I didn't like it! Any time spent with Agnes and Ruby is time well spent. And Lynn is a GREAT storyteller. It's just that there isn't as much adventure in this one (until the end) and there's a lot of talk. But very valuable talk it is! She's much more philosophical in this book -- reminds me of Ecclesiastes: We get older, our friends die, we think about the circle of life and death, the transitions, the fact that we are one, that our loved ones never really leave us. Be open. Believe. Move with the flow. It's all about love. Her closing words are golden: \\"There is magic in the world if you want the world to be magical. If you want life to be special, it will be. ... What matters is your ability to love. ...\\"	2002-04-26

MURDER@MAGGODY.COM is my first Arly Hanks book, but it looks like this one's about the 11th in the series that must have begun with MISERY LOVES MAGGODY. This appears to be a really popular series, and comes highly recommended by friends, but do NOT start with this one. Oh, sure, it has great local characters and a lot of humor, but I kept thinking I was missing out on something. The jokes seemed to be \\"in\\" jokes. I couldn't get the full understanding, as they say. I'm betting that if I went back and read the first one and then read this over I'd get more out of it. This book has a truly colorful story and takes quite a few twists and turns, but I won't read another one in this series unless it's the first one.	2002-04-26

I have adored every Amy Tan book so far, and this is no exception. Although I thought it was going to be. It starts out in present day, and I thought &quot;Oh, bummer. I miss the magic.&quot; The magic is her uncanny ability to open a window to China's past and hand us a passport that lets us stand there and feel the earth beneath our feet. What a gift she has. And then -- lo and behold -- she does it again! There we are, in the past, living with the characters in true Amy Tan style. This is like poetry -- smooth as silk, rough as broken glass. And so realistic. Her characterization of bullies hits home; it reminds me so much of some I've known. And the heart-piercingly accurate portrayal of Alzheimer's was done so tenderly it made me weep. What an excellent writer she is! Most memorable line: &quot;We are divine, unchanged by time.&quot; This is a love story, a story of survival and of family. It's really several stories intertwined (nothing new for Amy). Amy is one of the best artists we have living today. Write more, Amy!!	2002-04-26

THE IRISH COTTAGE MURDER is hard to put down. At last! A really promising new series. I enjoyed it so much I couldn't wait to get to the next one (THE IRISH MANOR HOUSE MURDER), so I read that one next. Dicey Deere's characters are not all well developed, but they're fun and easy enough to distinguish. The story is totally satisfying. Well, almost. The romance takes place \\"offstage.\\" Bummer! I did not like her clipped style at first, but don't let that stop you! The book becomes a real page turner. I LOVED the trip to Ireland and the bits of Irish history/culture. I only hope future books in the Torrey Tunet series will have even more local color.	2002-04-26

Even if you haven't read another book in the Den of Antiquity series yet, you could start with A PENNY URNED and not have missed anything. Here we're with Abby, her mom, and friends in Savannah, where we get to enjoy some of the local color while we watch them on a search for all manner of things, including lots of answers. There's a ton of silliness and a satisfying mystery, and the ending is really fun. Tamar Myers always leaves me wanting the next book. This edition even very kindly provides you with little excerpts from each of the six preceding entries in the series that began with LARCENY AND OLD LACE.	2002-04-26

RESURRECTION ROW is the fourth in the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series that begins with \\"The Cater Street Hangman.\\" Once again, Perry creates a fairly strong sense of place with very few details. She uses interesting twists and turns and colorful characters, and once again there's a certain amount of -- let's call it \\"unpleasantness.\\" Her books aren't pretty. This time we get more insight into Thomas's character, because Charlotte isn't involved as much in this one. And, as with Perry's others, we get a good look at all levels of the class system in place in London at the time. The plot is fascinating and the conclusion is very satisfying.	2002-02-11

THE COMPLETE COLLECTION is beautiful, perfect for your Thomas fan. But not for the youngest ones -- it's too big, and an overwhelming number of stories for the little guys at one time. Here are all the original Rev. W. Awdry stories and all the illustrations from three separate illustrators. (You can see the different styles of illustration.) It's a big, oversize, heavy book -- you're going to have to read it aloud -- and you'll have to adopt the occasional Scottish accent, too! There's a map of Sodor, a foreword by the author, and an afterword by Brian Sibley (author of the wonderful \\"Three Cheers for Pooh\\") that includes biographical info on Awdry and the illustrators. Plus, there are a few surprises: Thomas wasn't in the first story. And there's no mention of Sir Topham Hatt in this world where all the engines have names but most of the people don't. I guess \\"Sir\\" was a Britt Allcroft compilation of the different controllers. Allcroft, by the way, must be thanked for bringing Thomas back to life in the '80s, and even though the wording of those stories is different, you'll recognize a lot of them in these originals. Get this for your Thomas fan (and yourself -- it's hard to put down!). But also get some of the more recent books that are smaller and designed for young readers.	2002-02-11

POPPER'S PENGUINS is filled with gentle fun and sweet humor, but it's a little written-down to kids. An associate tells me this was one of the books his kids wanted to read over and over -- in the 1970s. Its copyright of 1938 makes this an official classic. It's ageless and timeless -- a simple idea with images that stay with you. I loved the illustrations by Robert Lawson. All the penguins are hilarious and every child will want his own. The story has some not-realistic-at-all moments, but it's fun, nevertheless.	2002-02-11

And a surprisingly good plot for a learn-to-read book! The author has obviously had a personal relationship with a cat, as she's captured Mulligan's personality and \\"priorities\\" very well. What intrigues me is the whole concept of \\"Step into Reading\\" books. This is a Step 1 book for the earliest readers. (There are four steps.) If you're new to them, as I am, let me tell you there are a LOT of titles in the series (listed at the back of the book). Some are Sesame Street books, Thomas the Tank Engine, Arthur, and more. If you have a preschooler, you might want to look into these.	2002-02-11

With the Alice Nestleton series you always expect a quality piece of work -- and A CAT WITH THE BLUES is no exception. This title refers, among other things, to the Russian Blue cat. I'm always delighted to travel around New York City with Alice and see it through the eyes of someone who obviously loves it and feels at home there. This time her helper isn't the usual Tony. (He would actually have been in the way.) And the cats didn't really help her solve the mystery this time. The ending is not predictable, and it's interesting and satisfying.	2002-02-11

The first is a simple book that lets the child learn to read, telling about the uses of different kinds of cars on trains. But it's also a great picture book. The illustrations are colorful, fun, and contain lots of interesting things to look at. Several of the pictures are excellent for sitting with a child and making up a story, or for asking the child \\"What do you see in this picture? What's going on?\\" A great Rx for the imagination.	2002-02-11

DEATH TRAIN TO BOSTON is the 5th in the series that began with \\"The Strange Files of Fremont Jones.\\" With every new book in the series I'm more impressed with her ability as a writer. The plots are complex, the characters are full, the rhythm of the book is captivating. This time Fremont's involved with a fanatic religious \\"family.\\" This brings up the question of Mormonism. I'm a little sorry that Mormonism was more made fun of than necessary when the people in this book were \\"breakaways\\" from Mormon. But that's not my battle to fight.

The series is reportedly for kids 7-10, but any adult is going to laugh out loud at the bizarre antics, the funny names, the comic book pages complete with misspellings, and the hilarious \\"flip-o-rama cheesy animation technique.\\" Kids will also love looking up their new names on the charts.

BOB'S BUSY DAY has only five two-page spreads, so be prepared to talk about the pictures in addition to reading. It has pop-ups AND lift-the-flaps for little hands. The text is kind of [boring]. But the cute pictures are really colorful, and kids will love to turn the pop-up pages and lift the flaps again and again -- esp. fans of the show who are familiar with the characters. I recommend this book for one-on-one reading aloud, and then for the kids to sit alone with the book, lifting the flaps.	2002-02-11

This is a follow-up to the remarkable \\"The World's Shortest Stories.\\" Each of these stories must contain 55 words or fewer, and the editors have rules that supposedly ensure that this 55 rule is obeyed. I don't think, however, that misspellings such as \\"alright,\\" not being a word, should be allowed -- or they should be edited to the proper two words and the story revised by the author. As a writer, I can truly appreciate the craft of brevity. And as an editor I can appreciate the discipline when the story is told within sentence structure (some are NOT -- they cheat). Some of these are startling. Some I quite frankly don't \\"get.\\" Some are a kind of prose haiku. Some have a lot of subtlety, saying things without saying them. This would make a good book for writing students, to get ideas about structure and brevity and learn how to think \\"outside the box\\" of writing. I read almost all of them at least twice. It's a keeper.	2002-02-11

I don't normally bother reviewing books I think are bad, but this one is SO bad I must say a few words, knowing it will earn me negative votes. I DON'T NEED TO HAVE CHILDREN, I DATE THEM is not just not funny -- it is offensive and vulgar. One wouldn't mind the vulgarity, I suppose, if there had been one laugh in the entire book. But no. This is the author of a book on training your man as you would a dog, so why would I be surprised when she suggests training him as you would a toddler? I bought it as a funny gift but started reading it and refused to give it to my friend, out of embarrassment. Save your money.	2002-02-11

I must say, in the genre of comic mysteries, Magdalena takes the cake! (And the pie -- Freni's Butterscotch  Chiffon Pie, recipe on page 37.) The Pennsylvania-Dutch references give it a real sense of place.

With interesting art in vibrant colors, the book describes the life cycle of the butterfly in poetry and then presents more detailed information on moths and butterflies -- and about which flowers will attract them. The inventive art, on odd-size pages, is outstanding. Some of the art is geometrical, some looks like paper cutouts layered to look three-dimensional.

I have never been a fan of short stories, but if more were like these I'd be a real fan. The author is incredibly good at character definition, and she can create a character in just a phrase. I really felt as if I knew these some of these people. Here's an example: \\"It was useless to appeal to Tippy's sense of right and wrong. She played Joni Mitchell songs on her guitar and told her friends she'd written them, figuring the 1960s were too long ago for anyone to remember.\\" My only complaint: It was TOO good! I became so immediately involved with some of the characters that I wanted the story to go on and on. The author never hits a sour note. Her style is so comfortable, you'll want to read the stories one right after another. But don't read them all in one sitting -- savor each one! Oh, and I LOVE the cover, with the little girl jumping rope!	2001-11-30

It's a modern setting, but the plot involves children who were moved out of London before the bombings in World War II. I found the book really hard to put down! The author also adds in elements of the romance novel -- sometimes a little silly, but I didn't mind. I can't wait to try the rest of these books.

I found \\"The Atlantis Blueprint\\" at times to be textbook-like, but full of interesting facts, with some familiar topics and some intriguing information I'd never heard before. Where a lot of books on these subjects jump to too many conclusions, I didn't feel this one drew up enough conclusions. I wanted more! The authors mix Thor Heyerdahl with Zechariah Sitchin, Charles Hapgood with the Knights Templar, and mix some of my favorite subjects -- the pyramids, geography, Atlantis, ancient history, mythology, geometry, religion. I've read many of the books referred to here, but plan to look up more of them. The notes and bibliography are truly valuable for the interested reader.<br />The authors present an interesting theory regarding the creation of \\"markers\\" to indicate pole movements. But I'm just not sure people on the ground would have consciously thought to do that. They wouldn't have known ahead of time that a pole shift would occur. It seems that would surely imply a view from &quot;outside.&quot; Nevertheless, this is truly a work worthy of respect and admiration.<br />Personally, I have always believed that pyramids were meant to be mountains -- man-made mountains for people who didn't have a natural one of their own -- sacred mountains for sacred rites and, yes, for markers, saying \\"here, God, here we are,\\" and for finding \\"home\\" from whatever distance away. For me this means, of course, that there was a first civilization that DID have a sacred mountain that was so meaningful to its people that its descendants felt they simply had to have a sacred mountain in order to relate to their god. So, accepting that the pyramids and other sacred sites are markers, we could theoretically follow their path and pattern to find this original mountain, no?	2001-11-26

This is kind of a \\"best of\\" compilation of their previous \\"magic eye\\" books -- but some of the 3-D images are really obscure. Even when I can see the image clearly, I can't figure out what it is. And even when I look at the back for the \\"key\\" to all the figures, I still don't know why they bothered! But it makes an interesting conversation piece. And it's pretty habit-forming. This is a really good book to have on hand for a party or anywhere you want to break the ice.	2001-11-26

This devoutly-to-be-wished combination comes off just as well as you might imagine. It really does present a day in the life of a one-eyed ogre in poems and pictures. And by all means, read it out loud! It's so much more fun that way. My favorite -- \\"When elves and gnomes encounter me, / They often shriek, `Grotesque!' / I bow with magnanimity / And murmur, `Statuesque!' \\" And the pictures! There are a lot of things going on in the four-color pictures. And kids will have fun finding them all! Some of the language is hilariously gross and disgusting -- and not for the squeamish! Prelutsky obviously has always loved the sound of words -- and big ones, at that. And as always, he doesn't write DOWN to kids. There is a glorious perfection in his rhythms. Kids will love to grimace and wince along with the gory subject matter. This book is so much fun!	2001-11-26

This series, one of my favorites, seems unfortunately to be losing a little of its identity. As the character loses her independence, she's surrendering some of the feistiness that made the series what it is. In this entry, she starts taking direction from her future husband and, as she does so, she's losing me as a devoted fan. The book is also about 50 pages too long; during the long middle section, I kept finding myself setting it down and doing other things, restless for the book to get on with it. I wouldn't say I was really disappointed, because she's a great mystery writer. Rather, the book isn't faithful to what the series started out to be. I can't fault the author for wanting to take the character in a new direction -- it's up to us whether to follow or not. But, darn it, I really enjoyed the first books in the series. I hope the fun comes back in future books in the series.	2001-11-26

Here's a lovely story with haunting images that will stay with you. It's a story of oppression reminiscent of &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; but it also has some harrowing adventure. It is at once charming and startling as we are plunged into the horror of Mao's &quot;re-education&quot; plan for China. It's a love story, yes, but it's mostly about the love of words, the insatiable thirst for stories, entertainment, and escape of any kind, the enormous revolution your life can undertake when introduced to new ideas, old wisdom, and beautiful language. It's especially delightful for those of us who love Asian literature. This translation from the French is a bit awkward in places, but it still manages to transcend language barriers and relate the magic the author intended. Frankly, I was drawn to the book because the cover is so beautiful, and I love the small size. As a former designer of publications, I immediately appreciated the beauty of the package, including the truly lovely typeface. It's a complete experience. And nothing in the book is overdone. It's like dessert for the soul.	2001-09-11

This book has a whole lot of interesting stuff going on -- love, death, religion, poison, babies, murder, &quot;crazy&quot; people, &quot;sane&quot; people. There is beautiful -- even magical -- language in the author's mataphors, but they are at times bizarre and incomprehensible. The mind games are pretty scary. There are also situations that are brutal and frightening. I suppose some of the plot resolution is predictable, but there are quite a few surprises. After the initial set-up, the book is very fast-paced, and it has an interesting ending.  The characters are totally different from any others I've encountered -- EVERYone has some kind of flaw. This family puts the &quot;dys&quot; in dysfunctional! An interesting read.	2001-09-11

The characters aren't just offbeat -- they're downright bizarre. Once the thing is set up, it's non-stop action. Remember how &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; brought together a lot of different story lines and bizarre charcters into one connected plot? Well, Dave's done it here, too, but I like the way it works better because it isn't mean-spirited. It's genuine fun. It reminds me of Donald Westlake's &quot;comic crime&quot; novels.

The author sets the mood and sense of place very well. The locale and the action are easy to see in the reader's mind. In fact, the whole story provides excellent fodder for the imagination. But it's NOT pretty. This is some scary stuff. It could have been a little longer to explain things more thoroughly, but I can understand wanting to keep it clipped short to move things along. I suggest that if you buy it for your &quot;young people&quot; you sneak a peek at it yourself!	2001-09-08

The author uses beautiful phrases, esp. in her descriptions of people. I experienced a remarkable feeling each time I became emotionally invested in a character and then realized/remembered that these weren't just characters, but REAL people who actually existed! There's an amazing insight here into the simple unfairness, ugliness, and sadness that comes from people's belief in race, invented solely to separate us and to make one group feel superior to another for no decent reason. It's also a lovely and respectful story of women. This side of the master/slave relationship has barely been looked at before. (I hope those silly and hurtful stories of how Sally Hemmings the slave &quot;loved&quot; her master Thomas Jefferson will stop soon!) And the way the same treatment was maintained for decades, not allowing unsanctioned marriages and keeping children from inheritance -- how cruel and unfair. The photos include beautiful faces full of strength, and they have a magical quality in bringing the characters to life. There are a few loose ends not followed and a couple of confusing moments, as well as leaps in time or action. But this is a huge undertaking, and I think these can be forgiven. It's obvious that the author is writing lovingly about the people who were a part of her. She can be very proud. I'm recommending this to everyone I know.	2001-08-19

This is another marvelous entry in the Fremont Jones series. Once again the author creates a full sense of place, and her main characters continue to develop into even more interesting people.

Even laugh-out-loud funny.	A remarkable book. Well thought out, well reasoned, well argued. As he did in the wonderful &quot;No Island of Sanity,&quot; Bugliosi turns up the light of truth so that we can see what is dwelling in the dark corners of Intention. I recommend this to anyone who lives in America, votes, reads, thinks. I don't really see how you could disagree with him, but even if you did circumvent his arguments you'd have to admit he did a brilliant and thorough job. I just wish he'd been the one to argue the case before the Court -- the Court, of course, for which I lost all respect on Dec. 12th as I sat before my television open-mouthed in disbelief that they could do this. The sad part is, of course, that they got away with it. And absolutely nothing will be done. And it's even worse -- at least two of the children of the five culprits have already been appointed by their beneficiary to nice, cushy high offices. Could this GET any more blatant? To those who have said and will say, &quot;Get over it; our boy won,&quot; I continue to say, &quot;No, he didn't win. He was selected.&quot; And even though I can get over an election it's hard to get over the loss of the Supreme Court. For that's what we've lost. The Court is made up of people, and people are fallible. And our Court's been wrong before, especially on the issue of race. But this time, in losing the respect of the American people and in fact of the world, they've now lost credibility on every issue. I'd say the five should all resign, but that was the plan of at least two of them anyway. They should definitely be ashamed of themselves. Bravo, Vincent, for standing up and crying &quot;Foul!&quot;	2001-07-18

It involves history, geography, travel, adventure, misery, joy, evil, and love. He creates marvelous three-dimensional characters. Even the countryside is like another character, because it's so full and important to the story. I first discovered this story on PBS's &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; and that production was true to the book. The video (of that production) and the audiotape are also excellent. I had tears in my eyes when it came to an end, wanting it to go on and on. A completely satisfying book.	2001-07-18

It's changed the way I look at people and the way I look at my own job. And it's so well written -- the darn thing is really hard to put down! Parts read like a novel, and I CARED about the people she met. <br />I want everybody to read this book! It's about work, it's about housing, it's about how we all treat the &quot;people without faces&quot;: the waiters, cleaners, factory workers, retail stockers, service industry workers, etc., who work their tails off and still make less than they need to get by. It's about a society that says these people want to live this way so why should we raise the minimum wage because that would just punish the poor business owner. It raises questions such as Why assume all your workers are going to steal from you? Why assume that only if we watch them degrade themselves by peeing into a bottle in front of us are they then worthy of stocking our shelves -- when our President is an admitted past drug user? It's about the economy, the invisible poor, health care, sick pay, child care, rest breaks, respect, silly pre-employment screening tests, drug tests, cameras watching every move. And &quot;skills,&quot; or lack of them. As she says, it's a fallacy to say &quot;unskilled labor.&quot;<br />I kept thinking, esp. in regard to the people in the book working two jobs, as so many people do, what kind of life do they have? I've always said, &quot;You only work so that you can afford to have a private life. And if you're not having a private life because you have no time or energy or can't afford it, or if your work leaks over and ruins your private life, then something's wrong.&quot; A good thought, but after this book it appears that I've been spoiled, and it's not that simplistic. She says in the book that what's going on is that these people are selling their lives. For minimum wage. And they're not getting paid what their life is worth. A life changer.	2001-07-18

I really wanted to like this one because King's Mary Russell books are so extraordinarily good. This first Kate Martinelli book introduces several interesting characters. But it didn't hold my interest at all. I guess I just didn't care about the characters -- I was never totally drawn in. I kept setting the book down and picking up a different one. The climax was intense and exciting, as King's always are, but then there's a lengthy epilogue that made me want to fast-forward through it. I DID finally finish it, but the book was just too long. One of the hardest jobs of a writer is knowing what to leave out, and one of the hardest jobs of an editor is telling the writer that. I can't recommend the book unless you're a die-hard Laurie King fan. But DO pick up &quot;The Beekeeper's Apprentice.&quot; That's one of the best of the genre.	2001-05-27

Brennan presents an interesting theory with a lot of background and factual evidence. Atlantis, however, is not the main theme of this book. The themes are actually (1) the idea that scientists have been wrong about the Ice Age all along and (2) the possibility of the catastrophic entry into the earth's presence of a visiting cosmic fragment of some kind. In other words, where did Atlantis go, all of a sudden? While at first the reader feels like scoffing -- oh, sure, no Ice Age, right -- one is drawn into the web created by the author's presentation. The amazing thing is that I found a kind of support for his theory in a totally bizarre place -- on a Christian Web site supporting a literal interpretation of the Bible. These people described Noah's flood and the sudden raising of mountains in almost the same way as this book's author. Makes you think! The book really could have used some illustrations to support the narrative -- not that I can't read a book without pictures! But he talks about the positions of planets, etc., and I sometimes had a hard time figuring out what he meant. The author talks about fascinating premises regarding global pre-history. For similar subject ideas, check out Zechariah Sitchin or Graham Hancock and the Flem-Aths. So, in the end, do I believe it? I don't know. That's not the point. The point is that it creates an amazing place for my mind to travel. A place of possibilities. And my mind just loves to travel to that place -- again and again.	2001-05-27

But I've always been a fan of &quot;Star Trek&quot; and fascinated by the incredibly clever details in the ST episodes that make it a believable world. Speaking of details, this book is full of them. The author explains how and why certain things could work and others couldn't. And I was again impressed by the sheer genius and consistency of the ST writers. Sure, it's disappointing to find out that some of the processes they invented could never actually work. What surprised me was that I actually understood why! This is so well written and so comprehensible that I'll probably read it again just to savor it. I highly recommend it for any ST fan.	2001-05-27

These books combine eerie mystery with a fun fantasy of everyday life in ancient Egypt. The entire series is like a dessert topping for those of us who enjoy reading about ancient civilizations. Ms. Robinson brings to life in a fascinating way the details of daily life in old Egypt. The fourth in the Lord Meren series is gruesome and just a tad confusing.

Written in the form of an adventure, the book is filled with dramatic tension as the ladybug survives the dangerous life of your own backyard.

It's a tiny book, but it's well written -- not &quot;written down&quot; to children -- and includes a glossary at the back. I think it's probably for third graders and above, but I predict adults will be happy to sneak a peek at it when the kids aren't looking.	2001-04-02

It's even better than the first two of the series, which I would have thought were impossible to top. This hard-to-put-down book is a superb read. Fremont's and Michael's characters continue to evolve, as does their relationship. And the ancillary characters are so much fun! Dianne Day absolutely sets up a world of time and place and mood and drops us in it. This has instantly become one of my all-time favorite reads -- mystery or otherwise. I'm not kidding! More!

The story is odd -- it seems to be missing a lot of pages. We know almost nothing about the aunt herself -- what is she like and what does she do, esp. between Christmas and Valentine's Day? It's a wonderful premise, and would make a good animated film, but somebody would have to do a lot of work developing a much more complete storyline. So many things are never explained -- even things in the pictures. For example, what is the smoking thing she's holding on the cover? I did like the &quot;salvation&quot; of Sophie, though. So don't pass it up, because the pictures are just glorious.	2001-01-29

This is the 8th Hamish Macbeth novel (c 1993), but the first time I've encountered him. He's drawn with humor and compassion by the author of the Agatha Raisin books. But Agatha is sometimes hard to like, whereas Hamish is very likeable and kind. The mystery follows an unusual path and has a satisfactory conclusion. The little Scottish town is going to be fun to visit, but in this book it's only a skeleton sketch of a place. I'm sure, as with the Agatha books, that it develops more of a sense of place as its description unfolds in the other books. The same goes for the town's characters. Here they are mostly just cutouts. But the &quot;temporary&quot; villains are well done. Still, it's a fun story and a charming character.	2001-01-01

In the late 1970s PBS presented a hilarious trilogy of plays called &quot;The Norman Conquests.&quot; I've been trying ever since to find them again. And here they are! This volume contains the scripts for all three of these amazing plays. Their premise: Norman is a real charmer who seduces (not necessarily sexually) everybody he meets. Each of the three plays takes place on a different stage. It's the same story and the same six characters, but seen from what happens only in each room in each play. It's an amazing accomplishment for a writer. This book carries an introduction by Ayckbourn that explains how he did it. And he says the plays are meant to be seen in any order. But I prefer the order given here: &quot;Table Manners&quot; (in the dining room), &quot;Living Together&quot; (the sitting room) and &quot;Round and Round the Garden.&quot; If you haven't experienced it, the videos are available now (finally!), as well. The production (the same I saw on PBS) stars Tom Conti as an unforgettable Norman.	2001-01-01

(hence, the worms) And do it in secret.&quot; And be a vegetarian.<br />The book is anecdotal (and wanders off the subject a lot) with spiritual and socio-ecological themes. My favorites: a discussion of lapis lazuli (my favorite stone) in praise of its &quot;spiritual purity&quot; and a very important discussion regarding television's harmful impact on children -- not for its presence, but because too much television means a lack of reading to kids, which actually causes a deficiency in the brain's ability to develop the visualization of what they hear and imagine.<br />It's worth your time. ....	2000-12-09

Sometimes they're disappointing as pop-ups, but there are some bright moments. The cover by Maurice Sendak allows you to see behind it into how the movements are made. The brownstones page is silly, with stupid bug cartoons everywhere. The library is really disappointing, with no real focus and no real view of what the building looks like. The art museum is just lovely, and is probably the best -- but then, it's by Sabuda (my favorite pop-up artist)! The botanic garden could have been the most colorful and beautiful page -- instead, it's childish and dull. The carousel is fun, with horses popping out at you. The Brooklyn Bridge is nice, but the flavors of Brooklyn are worthless. Coney Island is fun, with a rotating Ferris wheel. The book comes in a handy-dandy re-sealable plastic cover.

It's been two years since their marriage, and I like the way their relationship has grown. Charlotte's simple but happy life is seen here against her sister's more affluent lifestyle. The story is complex, like the first one, with a nice vision of the social system and a not-obvious ending. Interesting and well done. Makes me want to read the next one.	2000-11-29
US	52778876	R3U92WJTVTMN	0525456074	395008932	Rapunzel (Caldecott Honor Book)	Books	4	3	6	N	N	No wonder it won a Caldecott!	These pictures are so gorgeous I made one my screen wallpaper. I'd like to frame them and put them on my wall but don't want to damage the beautiful book. This is the classic Rapunzel story. As the other reviewers have mentioned, though, there is an uncomfortable moment when Rapunzel is discovered to be pregnant. If you're reading aloud to other people's children, you probably don't want to be responsible for bringing up that subject. I found a way around this. When reading to a small group of children, I change the story just a bit. I have a large, beautiful ring on a long string and I pull it out of my pocket at just the right moment and say that the young man gave this ring to Rapunzel. The prop is just enough of a distraction that even if the kids in front are following along with the words, they don't seem to notice the difference in text. Then, when the witch finds Rapunzel has put on weight, I pull out the ring on the string and say that while she was helping her dress the witch discovered Rapunzel's beautiful ring and knew someone had been there to give it to her, and the story goes on from there. But I don't like deception, so that's why I can only give four stars to this outstandingly beautiful book.	2000-11-29

Dubus has created such completely drawn characters that I feel as if I could recognize them in a crowd. This is very well written and interestingly put together. It's not just like watching a train wreck -- it's like being in one and watching it slowly unfold around you. By the time you get to the climax it's so intense and so inevitable you just can't get off that train for anything. But for a while I wasn't sure where he was taking us. We could clearly see how each person thought he was doing the right thing until the first stepped over the line. This very visual story will probably end up being a movie -- and a good one, at that.	2000-11-29

These pictures are so beautiful you could frame them. The colors practically glow -- the gold on its spools, the details in the castle rooms, the landscapes. It reminds me of Zelinsky's \\"Rapunzel,\\" but without the uncomfortable plot point of that one. He also goes into the story's history at the end, which explains a bit of the unfamiliar wording. Without going into that page, the rest is highly suitable for reading out loud to a small group of children. And this is enhanced by the oversize pages, which helps when you hold them up for the kids to see.	2000-11-29

Now that I've finished the book, I find myself puzzled by some of the effusive praise in these reviews. I didn't have any trouble with the complexity of the material or the combining of the three layers of the book. In fact, I looked forward to the switching back and forth. I really liked the juxtaposition of newspaper articles with Laura's novel. These articles crisply and easily set the time and place and moved the plot along.<br />The book starts entertainingly and ends pretty powerfully. The tale within a tale within a tale is bizarre, sci-fi fun. The tale within the tale is dark and often intriguing, but the tale itself is often simply dull. There were moments I set the book down and had a hard time motivating myself to pick it up again. It is at times extremely slow-going. Compared with the classic &quot;The Handmaid's Tale,&quot; which was tense and thorough and impossible to put down, this one is imminently put-downable until the last 100 pages or so.<br />Margaret Atwood is obviously a great literary figure, but here she needed a really good editor who wasn't afraid to rein her in and point out some seemingly self-indulgent or misdirected effort. But her considerable talent does shine through -- there is often a poetic, lyrical use of words here -- some of her phrasing is so poignant it made me stop and read it over and over. For the lover of words, the book is well worth your time. But plot-wise there is no love here -- the emotion, that is. It's really depressing -- and cold. No excitement, no passion. Yet, when all is said and done, once I had finished the book I knew I had finished SOMEthing. It was hefty. It was literature. I am grateful for the experience.	2000-11-06

Having discovered a new detective series (new to me) with &quot;The Cater Street Hangman,&quot; I was really looking forward to reading all the books in sequence. This one, however, didn't hold up to the pace or energy of the first one. I found it slow going, actually. And between the end of the last one and the beginning of this one Charlotte and Thomas were married -- cheating us all out of quite a bit of information, such as how her father took it, how everything went, etc. But it was an interesting plot and, I must say, I didn't guess the answer before the end, so all in all it was clever. I'm not really disappointed, but I hope the rest of the series regains the excitement of the first book.	2000-10-28

After my introduction to this ensemble cast with &quot;Pooh Goes Visiting,&quot; I looked forward to the rest of the series. But this one is a bit of a let-down. Be warned that the stories are, or seem to be, out of sequence. Contrary to the title, only two, I think, are about or even contain Tigger. And the voice of Tigger is REALLY annoying. Really. But the rest of the cast continues to bring a gentle wonderfulness to the Pooh stories -- so much so that it's well worth the annoyance of Tigger. Get this one, but don't miss the other, better ones.	2000-10-26

But this one differs a little from the others. It's got a fascinating premise, well-drawn characters, and some pretty tense plot points. It takes place (mostly) in a prison, where we see the brethren's machinations so clearly it's as if we're watching them with a camera. The brethren are brought to life on the tapes well by Michael Beck, but the star is the plot. Grisham's plot twists are so good that there was at least one moment when a surprise event made me audibly gasp. I like that in a book! The best thing I can say about a book on tape is that when I got home from work I didn't want to get out of the car until I listened to &quot;just a little more.&quot; With this one, I did that for several days!	2000-10-26

Whether you collect pop-up books or have never opened one before, please check this one out! This is Robert Sabuda, getting better every year, at his best. The abridged text is true to Baum's original, meaning that if you only know the movie you'll find differences. There's more text than in a lot of pop-up books, which is fine with me, since pop-ups make such good &quot;out-loud&quot; reading. But what pop-ups! The first pages open with a twisting cyclone! There's a full layout of the Emerald City, and there's a scene depicting the launch of the hot-air balloon. He's even included a pair of emerald green &quot;glasses.&quot; And there are mini-pop-ups throughout. Honestly, I think you will fall in love with this puppy.

And I've thought about them many times since reading the book. I bought several copies of this book as gifts for friends so that they could share the adventure.  Did it really happen, or was it all a dream? Or should I say, will it really happen? The part that takes place in the future is intriguing. I simply couldn't put the book down.

James Michener is one of my favorite authors, but I remember when he came to Kent to do the research for this book, and he evidently didn't do any himself, because the inaccuracies in this book outnumber the truths. It's so poorly put together that I stopped reading any of his books for several years after this one came out. Do not -- I repeat, do NOT -- base your perceptions of what happened in Kent on the material presented in this book. There have been so many other books written since then that are more accurate -- pick any of them. Better yet, read several. Everybody seems to have a different idea of what really happened anyway. As a member of the KSU class of 1970, I had several friends who were there that day, and some of them couldn't talk about it for 25 years. This is not a subject to be dismissed so lightly with so little regard for the truth. My feeling is that this was a true American tragedy that didn't need to happen, and only did happen because of political power, arrogance, and greed.	2000-10-14

The colors and sounds of Hawaii come to life with the characters he creates. The section on missionaries literally changed my life because it changed how I thought of the whole mission movement. This is presented in typical Michener style, starting with the pre-history of the region and bringing it through time to the present. The stories and characters presented here are among the most interesting he ever created.  I have often said I envy anyone who is reading it for the first time. Besides, it's like taking a Hawaiian vacation. Pick up a copy, and have a really good trip!	2000-10-14

(I say &quot;most&quot; -- not anywhere near &quot;all.&quot;)  But you won't find any &quot;vulgarities&quot; in here. She does give the meanings of a lot of the Cockney rhyming slang in the back.

I can't begin to tell you how much fun this book is for someone like me who's fascinated by ancient civilizations. I've read it several times now, and have bought probably five copies for friends. It's very readable and brings ancient history to life brilliantly. I have read everything I can get my hands on about Atlantis and other ancient/legendary civilizations, but this one is so all-inclusive, it was a real joy to find. The book is fascinating, well-documented, and presents theories as theories without jumping to unanticipated and unfounded conclusions. Hancock's theories about Atlantis were surprising and thought-provoking. It's a big book, but if you have a love for ancient history, you will think of every page as a wonderful treat.	2000-10-14

No one has ever topped Ferlinghetti for his exciting rhythm and electric presentation. Read this collection and discover how much FUN poetry can be. I first discovered these poems in the late '60s, an amazing time to be alive, and I felt that these poems captured some of that spirit uniquely and forever. What I didn't realize was that they also fit in perfectly with the '50s, and later in the '70s, the '80s, and the '90s, as well.

Hancock's work is very readable and easy to follow. This one, although not quite as good as &quot;Fingerprints of the Gods,&quot; is also sometimes hard to put down and often reads like a mystery/thriller. I think I just wasn't as interested in the ark of the covenant as I was in the material in the other book. But there's a lot of interesting information here that I've never seen anyplace else.

For those of us who have followed the adventures of Qwill, Koko, and Yum Yum from the beginning, this is another pleasant visit to the wonderful world created by Lilian Braun. For those who are starting the journey for the first time, maybe you should start with a different book in the series. This is not one of the best -- and the cats play a very small role. Try one like &quot;The Cat Who Could Read Backwards,&quot; &quot;... Ate Danish Modern,&quot; &quot;... Turned On and Off,&quot; or &quot;... Saw Red.&quot; These are the early ones (in order) and also my very favorites, with some truly interesting plot lines and quirky characters. This time there's no Polly (which is more of a blessing in my opinion) and  the personalities of the people are subdued rather than quirky. The mystery isn't much of a mystery. It seems she's running out of ideas or enthusiasm. (Hey, Lil, Babe, we love you -- get over it!) But I still love to visit with the people of Moose County, and this won't keep me from reading the next one. In fact, these books are such a special treat for me that for the past few years I have taken off a vacation day from work, just to read that year's book. Long live the lovely cats! .	2000-10-07

Once again, Tamar Myers has brought her Pennsylvania Dutch mysteries with recipes to life. Magdalena and her sister are hilarious (although Sis is more in the background this time), as are the rest of the characters. The recipes always look extremely yummy, but I'm not a cook. Why only 4 stars? I got really overdosed on the references to Spam the name-brand food product. But I still can't wait to start the next book. If you're a Myers fan (I think &quot;Too Many Cooks Spoil the Broth&quot; was the first in this series), you'll also like her Den of Antiquity books. .	2000-10-07

This is one of the &quot;Den of Antiquity&quot; series featuring the hilarious Abigail Timberlake as the tiny but powerful owner of an antiques store. It's set in modern-day North Carolina where some of the characters -- and I do mean characters -- are still hoping the South will win the Civil War. Abigail's sarcasm is the real joy here -- sometimes it's pretty acidic. But where Tamar Myers's constant humorous touches abound in this book as in her Pennsylvania Dutch series, some of the funnies here are in-jokes about other mystery series, and if you don't know about them, they fall flat. But who cares, what with the bitingly sarcastic Abby running all over North Carolina doing admittedly stupid things and yet ending up solving a crime. Or did she? Anyway, it got solved. And she and Mama came out OK! I believe the first in the series is &quot;Larceny and Old Lace,&quot; but you don't need to read them in order. I never miss one of these! And here's a fun touch: This edition has a little taste of several other mystery writers at the end of the book. It's like a little appetizer for the mystery lover. .	2000-10-01

OK, so they're not new, but they are to me. And what a series! This is the first of the Charlotte Pitt series, and I can't tell you how wonderful it is. The writing is absolutely first-rate. The setting is dark, gothic, moody, and the characters well drawn. The reader can be totally immersed in the time and place. This is a real page-turner. I was able to guess who did it before the end and yet felt compelled to finish reading. The ending was NOT just tacked on to make the book stop. Everything worked together for a complete narrative.

If you  like this type of book, I also suggest Lydia Adamson's &quot;A Cat...&quot;  series (I believe they start with &quot;A Cat of a Different Color&quot;)  and Lucy Wayles mysteries (&quot;Beware the Tufted Duck&quot;).

After all, Laurie King's Mary Russell  series is a humdinger. Those are real page-turners. This one was not. OK,  OK, there were places where the pages couldn't turn fast enough, but really  very few. The main character was very well drawn, but it kind of slumped  into the realm of romance novel, which it really needn't have done. I  suppose it's my own fault for having read so much about cults -- this one  just didn't have the ring of truth. And it didn't seem scary enough for all  the concern. The ending seemed implausible. Ah, well, it won't keep me from  reading the others in my Laurie King library. But try it out for yourself:  This one came highly recommended, so obviously somebody out there loved  it.<br />.	2000-09-10

I've read it several times, and  I'm sure I'll read it again. I don't really like the audiotape version, but  it, too, is the best of the lot. But it's very important that you try to  read them in order, because Qwilleran and his situation change and grow  throughout the series. And some of those changes will surprise you, but  only if you read them in order. By the way, if you're trying to figure it  out, the first one is &quot;The Cat Who Could Read Backwards,&quot; in  which we're introduced to Q and he meets Koko. Enjoy!<br />.	2000-09-10

An amazing experience you really don't want to miss. I've listened to the  whole set of tapes (18 in all, I believe) at least four times now, and some  of the individual tapes over and over. I can't convey to you how much this  book means to me. The voices of Ellen Burstyn and Ed Asner bring the  &quot;God&quot; dialogues to life. And Walsch is one of the best at reading  his own work. If ever there was a book on philosophy that you should take a  look at, it's book one. At least listen to the definition of reality. When  you get to book two, keep an open mind. The political stuff is a bit weird,  but there are some gems of philosophy to think about in there. And when you  get to book three, it can be -- well, life-changing.

This book sells itself, of course, with the beautiful paintings from  throughout history. But I have just a couple of problems with it: First, I  question the choices of some of the art in the book. Or should I say not in  the book. Of course, they couldn't put in every painting ever done, but I  think there are some too-obviously missing pieces. Second, I miss Sister  Wendy's warm humor. The material seemed clipped, as if the editor just  crossed out everything funny, just to shorten the material. Well, not  everything -- some of it managed to find its way in. On both of these  counts, I must say I would rather have had two volumes and included more  paintings and more of her commentary. This one is just not enough. But  still, if you were brought up to admire fine art, as I was, you will LOVE  sitting down with this book.<br />.	2000-09-10

You start to analyze EVERYthing -- especially yourself. That's what Samantha  does -- as she agonizes her way to a new life. This is a fun book. And the  characters are a hoot. Omigosh, this lady can write! The dialogue is so  natural and realistic, I found myself reading it out loud, and it always  rang true. It only took a few hours to read, and I must say it gave me a  lot of laughs. (It's not a farce, by any means. It's really quite gentle  and warm.) There were several real surprises in the book, too -- not plot  twists, but weird characters popping up or really odd job situations or  just a smack-on-the-button remark. Here's one that hit me for some reason:  She's trying to help her son with his math homework, which reminds her of  how she didn't understand geometry in high school, and she remembers taking  her midterm: &quot;I passed the time by drawing designs for evening gowns  on the back of the exam; everything on the front of the page only annoyed  me.&quot; I don't know what it is, but it has that magical something.

(Start with &quot;The Beekeeper's Apprentice&quot; and see  what I mean.) At any rate, they write in a similar manner, and both are  excellent. TRY THEM!<br />Oh, yeah. ... She lives through the Quake. Hence,  sequels abound! .	2000-08-29

Shirley MacLaine continues her highly readable autobiography, adding yet  another adventure we can tag along on. This time she walks the length of  northern Spain on a sacred pilgrimage, and along the way she experiences  some wacky characters, friendly spiritual visitations, and moments of  enlightenment.<br />If you like the many facets of this adventure, be sure to  go back and read her &quot;Out on a Limb.&quot; If you like the story of  the hike, its odd characters, and bizarre tribulations, look at Bill  Bryson's &quot;A Walk in the Woods,&quot; in which he chronicles his hike  on the Appalachian Trail. If you enjoy the descriptions of her visions, you  may like Barbara Hand Clow's books, particularly &quot;Heart of the  Christos,&quot; in which she envisions herself in many different roles from  ancient times. If you're curious about the possible role of  extraterrestrials in the evolution of man, look up Zechariah Sitchin's  books (start with &quot;The 12th Planet&quot;). If these ideas are new to  you, you may find his hypothesis really hard to accept, but just consider  what a fascinating premise he lays out. And if you are interested in her  spiritual ideas about reality and the nature of life, the universe, etc.,  Neale Donald Walsch's &quot;Conversations with God&quot; makes it pretty  easy to understand.<br />Shirley's a gift to us all. She has made it easier  for us to open our minds and let some new stuff in. By taking on the brunt  of the media's sarcasm, she's made me look downright mainstream! Even if  you find you just can't believe in any of this stuff, it's fun to read.  Think of it as very visual science fiction.	2000-08-09

These pictures of black women in America will touch you in many ways, and  in some cases will rip your heart out. Each photograph has a story on the  surface and another deep inside it, and some force you to think about them  for a long time. Every person who's opened my copy of the book has looked  at a few pictures and then gone &quot;Omigod&quot; when the right one hits  home -- and it's always a different picture. The accompanying text is also  thought-provoking -- quotes from women in historic and ground-breaking  situations, women who have earned positions of authority, authors, and  poets. Open any page and you're right back there -- with photographs of  women living in slavery, with women fighting during the struggle for civil  rights, with women trying to make the best of life, with women just trying  to survive, with women finding joy in the midst of everything. It amazes  and delights me that these two white women decided to put together such a  remarkable chronicle about black women, recognizing that the history of the  black woman in America is every American's history.	2000-08-09

Well, it's really good, anyway.	I admit it -- I'm one of those people who can sit in a cornerreading a book on grammar and be perfectly content for hours. I'm also one of those lucky enough to have stumbled across Bill Walsh's Web site...several years ago. Here in this fabulous book he has transferred most of the good advice from his Web site, so that I can now carry it with me wherever I go. (Would I actually do that?  Hmm ...)<br />Bill makes the subject of grammar not only readable, but fun. Yes, I said &quot;fun&quot;! He argues against some of the &quot;silly taboos&quot; of ancient grammatical rules, but he also makes suggestions about when to go along with the rules even if they don't make sense, &quot;if only to avoid the scorn of the misinformed legions.&quot; His examples are often hilarious: &quot;Individuals who need individuals are the luckiest individuals in the world&quot;; &quot;Why does Paul McCartney want me to live on his piano?&quot; (You'll have to look in the book for an explanation.)<br />No, I'm not on his payroll, but I am in his debt. I've used his advice to help me decide how to rewrite a sentence (I don't always agree with him, but it's a real rarity when I don't) and used his examples to add humor to my day. Once you get the book, don't be surprised if you look up how to use a semicolon and find yourself still reading the book a half hour later, chuckling all the way.	2000-08-08

Don't let anyone give away the surprises. It is SO MUCH FUN! This book has everything! It is at the same time laugh-out-loud funny (the characters, the spells, the names!) and  nail-bitingly thrilling. People you learn to love and some you love to  hate. Is the book too long? Hardly! The last 100 pages or so, I couldn't  put it down -- the action was too quick to let go for even a minute. But  try not to speed through it -- savor every sentence.<br />Chapter 1 will knock  your socks off! Jo Rowling is an indisputable genius, and her writing just  gets better and better. Not only has she created an entire complex world  filled with believable characters, but those characters all have rules they  have to live by, and the world itself has physical laws and limits. She  maintains consistency in book four so that the world remains very, very  real to us as we read it. And the imagery! It's like we're  &quot;watching&quot; the book! We can &quot;see&quot; it all happening as  we read. The book just opens up the whole realm of the imagination.<br />Harry  Potter is such a joy. No wonder kids of all ages (I'm a baby-boomer!) have  become fans. And for goodness' sake, start with book one! You'll understand  so much more and enjoy it so much more if you start at the beginning  (&quot;HP &amp; the Sorcerer's Stone&quot;). As if that were a difficult  assignment -- that's like saying, &quot;Oh, no, you shouldn't eat your  fourth piece of this delicious chocolate candy until you've had your  first.&quot;<br />And the story -- well, so many adventures, so many plot  twists! Who will be hurt? Whom can you trust? When can you start reading!	2000-07-15

This is the one to read!	Jeffrey Toobin lays the facts out so well that I was able to follow the entire multi- faceted &quot;Days of Our Lies&quot; soap opera from beginning to end. He shows no favorites -- no one comes out smelling like a  rose -- and there are no heroes here. I certainly wouldn't want to have  lunch with any of these people. But seeing the two distinct sides of the  issue and exactly how the members of one side were dedicated to the total  destruction of the other side, and how they used whatever power they could  draw toward this end, is amazing. It's some of those behind-the-scenes  players who are the most fascinating. Much of the book reads like a novel,  in that it's packed with mysterious doings and mischievous people, and it's  hard to put down. As for the reviews on this page, I find them very telling  -- the hard-line Clinton-haters hate the book (surprise!), and probably  would have whether they had read it or not. From what they say, however,  some do seem to have finished it. This only tends to show just how readable  the book is.	2000-05-15

The kids love them, and so do the adults! We all laugh out loud again and again as the great big horse face pops out at us. The colors are  brilliant, and the pop-ups aren't just clever; they're sturdy, too. They  may not hold up to a thermonuclear attack, but our one-year-old has grabbed  at them any number of times, and they've survived so far!

No, I wouldn't have believed it, either. But once I got into it I realized that Bridget had become a multi-dimensional character I cared about. So many  laugh-out-loud moments of her hilarious misadventures that I lost count.  (I. Am. Not. Kidding.) This will surely develop into a cult -- reminds me  of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous.&quot; How can you NOT love Bridget? And even  her bizarre, oh-how-you-love-to-hate-them enemies. And so many plot  surprises! Just when you think the bizarre quotient has been reached,  AAARGH! I will definitely recommend this to everyone I know. And I'll read  it again.	2000-05-08

Ian McKellen brings The Odyssey to life with his extraordinary gift. Fagles' translation is superior to any other I've found.

I'm not sure what I expected from this book when I picked it up. With Princess Grace on the cover (it doesn't talk about her at all) and a chapter about Diana, I guess I thought it would be about how great women took the hounding by the media. Well, it sort of is. But mostly it's about  the gossip reporters, and about how the news industry, over the last few  decades, slowly but solidly lost its integrity and turned toward sleaze for  ratings and &quot;scoops.&quot; Fascinating stuff! It doesn't so much  repeat the gossip as it does tell how reporters get their story and what  they do with it. I couldn't put this book down, except that every once in a  while the sleaze factor was so great, I had to go and bathe just to feel  clean again. There were parts I didn't really find captivating, but others  where I laughed out loud, mostly at someone's arrogance. There's something  in here for everybody. Easy to read, well written. I wanted more!	2000-04-18

I wish it had been a little longer! The story, as the author admits at the end, comes right out of the Malory version of the Arthurian legend, which is perhaps the best known.  This story, therefore, comes as no surprise to those of us who love King Arthur. The surprise here is in the illustrations. He has put us into the medieval tale in a new way by illustrating the story with stained glass windows. Well, that's how they look, anyway. And we are drawn through them into Arthur's time. Sabuda admits that he wrote and illustrated this one especially for the boys, and I can see how it would appeal to them. But there's nothing here that would turn off a girl's interest, either.<br />Sabuda is well known for his amazing pop-up books, and I have copies of all of them. I'm glad I've added this book to my collection.  Although it's not a pop-up, it's a very interesting concept, and it's beautifully executed. I know the kids will love it!  END	2000-04-10

This book really puts the reader there at the scene during the last days of Diana and Dodi. And it's so easy to read! The narrative flows very quickly. The British colloquialisms are a little over-abundant, but I quickly figured out what they meant. And his unique perspective is one  we've long been waiting to hear. He gives us his answers -- which make a  lot of sense, by the way -- to a lot of the questions we've been waiting to  ask. It's a miracle he survived this crash, and it's lovely to know he's  such a nice guy. I expect he (not just the book) will get some really  negative reviews, since this is not at all flattering to the Fayeds, but  then he says he only wrote the book because they attacked him. Royal  watchers will really want to read this book!	2000-04-03

His use of words is absolutely beautiful. So ... after &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars,&quot; which I adored, I really looked forward to this one. Alas and alack, I was disappointed. I was, let  us say, a captive audience in the car while the tapes played, and after a  short while I was beginning to get antsy for the book to have a storyline.  The detailed descriptions of the gore (my friend said he'd never heard the  word &quot;viscera&quot; used so much before) made me queasy. And it's so  depressing! Eventually, I was sorely tempted to grab the steering wheel and  ram the car into a tree to stop the horror, and by the end I was ready to  rip my ears off to escape. My boss loved it -- recommends it to everyone he  sees. I didn't love it -- and I'm not alone. Like I said, the writing is  beautiful -- almost poetic. The plot leaves a whole lot to be desired. So  give it a try. Just please be warned that it's definitely not like  &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars.&quot;	2000-02-29

It had me totally engrossed in the character, her adventures, and the beautiful writing. Some of the visual  images are still with me -- especially the lighthouse of her girlhood,  riding with her in the lookout perch high above the whaling ship, and the  winter scenes. The only thing I found a tad annoying was that the  &quot;name dropping &quot; was a little heavy-handed in the last quarter of  the book. But I basically reveled it the book, and have highly recommended  it to several of my &quot;serious reader&quot; friends. If you want to read  it for adventure alone, read just the first half. If you want something  more to think about, read the whole thing. Personally, I think I'll wait a  few months and read it again!	2000-01-27

Here's the thing: I read this in about two days, so it obviously held my interest. The premise is fascinating. But the writing, badly in need of a good editor, often made me cringe. There were several loose ends and  conclusions that didn't add up, besides the many spelling and grammatical  errors. And who needs that horrible opening sequence about &quot;Poor  Di&quot; who lived such a wretched existence, yadda yadda yadda. If you  want a book that isn't so disgustingly slanted in favor of her being a  saint rather than a real person (and no true &quot;Di Fan&quot; does), read  &quot;The Real Diana&quot; -- but you won't. That one made me believe in  her as a person, and it also made me admire her in the end for overcoming  her problems when all I had seen was her whining and her rude exposure of  the family secrets because she couldn't have everything her way. Implying  (in &quot;Whose Death&quot;) that the queen was Satan was a bit more than I  could take.	1999-08-23

I was a little wary about reading this book, since Oprah raved about it so  much. I thought nothing could live up to that much praise. But it really is  a beautifully written work. The language is so rich it's taste-able, and  where the story is ugly, the language is ugly. The characters are so  complex I think I'd know them if I met them on the street.

I couldn't stop reading! I could visualize what was  happening -- so much so that at times it made me very emotional. Too bad  that after the powerful opening he went into old info on her growing up,  etc., that I'd already read elsewhere, some of which was obviously taken  from the biased and misnomered Morton book. There were at least two errors  I found. But the material about Dodi and about Diana after the divorce was  totally fresh to me. The final ride was intense.    Actually, I wish he'd  had yet another chapter with more follow-up. I'd rate it a 9 out of 10.	1998-08-24
