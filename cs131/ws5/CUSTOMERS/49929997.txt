I have no problem with it except the occasional minor quibble.  OK, that's my review.  Now, here's a concern I have.  The writer would have us believe that he started Mars Hill and that the Mars Hill of Grand Rapids is the only one in the country.  (Correct me if my interpretation is flawed.)  But here in Seattle, we also have a relatively new Mars Hill church, huge like his, and there was a lengthy newspaper article about it this week in which not one word was mentioned of Grand Rapids or that pastor's church.  Are they not related?  Is the writer of Velvet Elvis being disingenuous by not saying that (like, for instance, Calvary Chapel) he started one branch of a church and didn't actually start the original church itself from the ground up?  I'm confused.  Either the church in Grand Rapids is the original church and the pastors here in Seattle didn't mention that to the reporter, or Mars Hill is a national movement of which the writer of Velvet Elvis is but a part, and he should have mentioned that in his book.  Can anyone clear this up for me?  Thanks.	2005-08-30

However, I take great exception to Christian publishers' tactic of reissuing a book under a new title years later with no clue on the cover that this book has appeared before.  This book was published as \\"Lion and Lamb\\" around 1986, and I didn't realize until I got home that what I was holding was a reissue.  It also happened to me with John Guest's \\"In Search of Certainty\\" (original title), which was reissued as something else, and a book on contemporary Christian music.  I've never seen this happen with secular books.  Nevertheless, if you never read \\"Lion and Lamb,\\" read this book.  Manning is one of our sanest Christian writers.	2005-08-19

If you haven't read Huck Finn in decades (possibly when it was assigned to you in junior high), pick it up again and be amazed.  (If you've never read it before, pick it up and be thunderstruck.)  Hemingway wasn't wrong when he said that all American literature came from this book.  It was the first novel that truly captured one strain of American vernacular (actually, several), and the character of Huck is so quinetssentially American that you're bound to recognize all sorts of American literary first-person characters who have directly followed (Holden Caulfield and Augie March, just to name two).  Forget the PC issue -- when you read fiction, judge words in their contexts, not by their politics beyond the page.  If you're too young to do that, perhaps you're not ready for it anyway.  I was force-fed Huck Finn at 14 and remembered it with only bitterness until I picked it up in my 30s and was amazed (see first sentence).	2003-11-03

If it were up to me, I'd place a copy in every hotel and motel room in America, right next to Gideon.  I realize that some books just hit us the right way at certain times in our lives, and I once had a hard time trying to persuade 18- and 19-year-olds to appreciate this one.  But when I was around 30, I read the title novella, and it changed my life by changing my outlook on life and enabling me to make some decisions I'd never have taken seriously if I hadn't read it.<br />But I don't want to scare you off.  Tolstoy is perfectly accessible, the title character's dilemma is heartrending (the title gives you a clue), the characters universal, and the effect upon closing the cover after the last page indelible.  If one person reads it after reading these 10 reviews, I'll be happy.	2003-10-31

On the other hand, the negative things Levy has to say turn out to be for personal reasons.  You have to wait for the afterword at the back of the book to find out that he and Lewis didn't see eye to eye and Levy felt hurt by this.  Hence, the dirt.  It's the Mommie Dearest Syndrome.  Christina Crawford, we learn when we read that book, actually had made up with and was very close to her mother at the time of Joan Crawford's death.  Then, inexplicably, Crawford left Christina out of her will.  Hence, the dirt.  So if Levy had (a) just skipped the afterword altogether, (b) put it up front as a preface so we could go into the book knowing the motivation, or (c) eased up on some of the vitriol, it would have been a better book.  I'll read more books on Lewis, but I won't be reading anything else by Levy.	2003-07-15

Jaws the novel was an obvious by-the-numbers potboiler that wanted so badly to be a bestseller that Benchley stuffed sex and profanity into it even though it had no place in the story (see movie for proof) and merely stuck out like speed bumps in the plot's momentum.  An awful, dreadful, amateurish book.

What I knew, I know some more.  What I didn't know, I found hard to believe.  Everything comes across as calculated, one eye on the polls.  Even the fictitious account of Bill breaking the news to her about Monica is an obvious ploy to capture the hearts of both women and men who she'd like to see her as more sympathetic.  (If she really didn't know, she was the only person in America who didn't, which makes her a lousy candidate for leader of the free world, and if she did know, that makes her a liar.

I got to know her in New York in the late 70s through a mutual friend, and she was a warm, intelligent, and compassionate woman.  I wish I could find her today to let her know how my own story has ended up.  But anyway, read this book if you are a survivor who needs to know you're not alone, a perpetrator who is on the road to recovery (though there is never 100% recovery for them, and I would not trust one completely with anyone under the age of 16), or just someone interested in this field of criminal psychology from a layman's perspective.	2003-04-17

I ended up skimming it, though, after the introduction, which was a mess that rambled without any structure from paragraph to paragraph.  By skimming the rest of the book, I was able to glean several really interesting tidbits I wanted to know about (such as the fact that &quot;I'll Be Home for Christmas&quot; was released a year after &quot;White Christmas,&quot; clearly to cash in on the latter's success), but I didn't have to endure the style (or, for that matter, the typeface, which I don't see that often and which tripped me up visually a few times).  Also, perhaps it's the author's youth, but there are small but nagging discrepancies here and there (for instance, he doesn't know the distinction between a Christmas song and a carol).  And his opinions seem wedged into what is otherwise an objective look at the history of a song -- I frankly found myself not caring what this guy thought -- I just wanted to know what he knew.  I'd say get it if &quot;White Christmas&quot; is your favorite song and if you don't already know too much about it or about Irving Berlin, but otherwise find yourself a good Berlin bio and enjoy that.	2002-12-12

You're not a hero simply because you die unexpectedly.  Let's not get carried away.  Because the subject of this book is heroism as exemplified by a hero, it's worth reading, even if Beamer isn't a writer (or a hero herself, even though the book's profits go toward charity -- that's not heroism, because it takes no bravery to do the right thing financially when you're not hurting financially).

This explains why I've never been able to take King's meandering and severely unedited style.  The tone of everything he writes, no matter how &quot;scary&quot; some may find them, is, &quot;Well, eventually I'll get around to the next scene and eventually even to a scene that moves the plot ahead.&quot;  Such a writer needs to stick to short stories, but at best, a Stephen King short story belongs in Alfred Hithcock Magazine, not on a bestseller list and certainly not in the New Yorker, where he's been turning up lately.  That latter panache in his resume must be the reason he actually wrote a book on writing and why he comments on the evolution of each of these stories in this book.  He believes he's a writer.  He's a typist who's never suffered from typist's block, that's for sure.  But a writer?  Please.  Writers are also editors, plotters, stylists.

But I must tell you, this is heavy going, for as small a volume as it is.  I found myself just not really interested in much of what was being said, and its focus is really geared more toward musicians -- singers -- than writers.  I do think that anything that allows me to concentrate more on the sheer sounds of words and letters (as opposed to simply meaning) is a good thing, so I'm glad I do have it.  But the most valuable part, for me, is probably the appendix that features some vocal exercises that get us to really listen to the way sounds sound coming out of our mouths.	2001-02-09

I try to read his novels, but while he might be an OK writer, his editing (or lack thereof) is distractingly deficient.  Also, he uses profanity the way freshman comp writers use it, as if he were still sixteen and fascinated with its power but naive regarding its proper effectiveness.  But when I saw that this book was relatively (for him) small, and also available in the library, I got a copy.<br />It's actually good.  He includes revealing insights into his upbringing, his creative flowering, his marriage, the conception and growth of his first novel, Carrie (this part was really interesting), as well as practical tips for every young writer and a memorable account (first published in The New Yorker) of his near-fatal accident.  I almost wish he'd written more about his addictions, but I decided that after all this is a memoir, and his goal here is to discuss writing.<br />He still has a problem making his profanity sound natural (a good one-liner with &quot;Magna Carta&quot; for the kicker is ruined by his insertion of the &quot;f&quot; word in between the two words, which was totally unnecessary because the phrase itself worked as is), and he has a really irritating and amateurish way of being too PC for his own good -- his constant use of &quot;his/her,&quot; &quot;him/her,&quot; and &quot;himself/herself&quot; in later sections really distracts from whatever he's saying.  (He should know that the trick is to change the singular to plural if the context allows it, which in his case it always does.  Even if he insisted on showing off his gender fairness, &quot;or&quot; is preferable to a slash, simply because we don't pronounce slashes, and King of all people prides himself on naturalistic prose.)<br />Overall, a good read, recommended.  I'm surprised that, for a King book, it's so accessible at the library after less than a year in print -- maybe his fans are scared off by what sounds like the threat of a grammar handbook.  It's more than that, though.  I might even give one of his novels a try, now that I've gotten to know him a little.

But I also admire life, surprise, human voices, and raw power in poetry, and the more I read of this collection, the more I felt the need to open a window for some air.  Too many of these poems were left-brain exercises in language, but language as divorced from life.  And the lengths!  There wasn't a single long poem in this collection that I had any interest in continuing with after the first three pages, and to my dismay, many of these went on considerably beyond three pages.

And yes, it is poetry, even if it's truly bad poetry.  There are good poems and there are bad poems, and that's no more elitist than to say that Battlefield Earth is a bad movie and The Godfather is a good one.  Poetry is an art and a discipline.  If you want to write about your aching heart or how much you love the springtime and you rhyme &quot;moon&quot; and &quot;June&quot; in the process, I'm going to call it what it is -- bad poetry -- but it's still poetry.  This doesn't make you a poet, however; the term is &quot;poetaster.&quot;<br />Jewel was fortunate enough to have a famous name in another field and thus, like Richard Thomas, was able to get this stuff between hard covers without paying any dues.  Hardback collections of good poetry, on the other hand, consist of poems previously published in magazines that likely wouldn't give Jewel or Thomas the time of day.  Those poets paid their dues by already being published and by being good.<br />If the name &quot;Jewel&quot; and the title &quot;A Night Without Armor&quot; aren't enough to dissuade you, I hope I have.	2001-01-16

Conversely, this must mean that &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is second only to Shakespeare.  How sad.  (He sounds like the Village Voice when it berated the movie &quot;Arthur&quot; for being a comedy about rich people.)  The trouble with narrow schools of criticism is that they cease to be about the text and focus instead on their own dogmatic (or phlegmatic) view of the world.  I suggest you just read the novel and make up your own mind.  Bathe in Fitzgerald's descriptions (especially Nick's first sight of Daisy in the wind-blown room), the gradual unveiling of the truth about Gatsby, and the suspense and heartbreak of the last few chapters.

But what makes me feel this way is what Updike deliberately doesn't say about this one evening in the life of Richard and Joan Maple and their guest, Rebecca Cune.

The posts for this novel are really amazing, with plenty of one- and five-star opinions and equal passion from both camps.  As for me, I loved it.  I think if you're assigned the book in a classroom and have no particular interest to begin with, you might have a problem with it.  And if you're below college age, it might not be for you.  McDermott appeals not to much to the intelligence of the average reader as to the patience of a mature reader, and I don't think all that much patience is really required, either.  By the end of the first section, with its astonishing verisimilitude for a particular time and place, and the neat little surprise twist at the end, I was hooked the rest of the way.  And somewhere in the middle, while describing a rainy Irish funeral, she uses one parenthetical simile to describe the sound of the rain on the umbrellas that was so powerful I had to put the book down.
