It won't give you any blazing insights that will help you convince Tiger not to chew on shows or Lenny from humping legs. There are better, more practical books for that.<br /><br />This may not be a great book for dog _lovers_ either. It takes a rather blunt look at the relationship between _canis domesticus_ and _homo sapiens_ in a wide variety of cultures.<br /><br />If you are interested in the big picture, and a convincing but not necessarily totally accepted scenario for how wolves evolved into dogs, you should definitely check this one out. There's fascinating stuff on how \\"pariah dogs\\" might have morphed into basic working breeds, the differences between wolves, dogs, and coyotes, and much more.	2005-09-21

This comeeck was recommended by someone who compared it to Pekar's _American Splendor_ series. They're both autobiographical, both about oddballs, both illustrated by a large roster of noted comic artists.<br />I'm about half-way though, and from what I've seen it's even better than _Splendor_. The stories are widely varied. Some are from Eichhorn's childhood and school daze, others from his time as a fire-fighter in Alaska.<br />We get to know the brooding, introspective Pekar better through his comics, but Eichhorn's are funnier and more fantastic. Others are horrifyingly violent. Some I can believe happening, others are incredibly way-out. Like the story of Strange Love between a German shepherd puppy and an orphan fawn, or the time Eichhorn makes a quick twenty bucks with a pair of swim flippers while down and out in San Francisco. We're not in Baron Munchausen territory, mind you, but if they're real then Eichhorn is a real weirdness magnet.<br />The artwork varies, but it's all effective and in some cases really great.<br />In any case, it's highly recommended. Like a lot of graphic novels you won't want to leave it around where the kids or grandma will get at it.<br />Stefan	2004-07-16

Books	3	0	0	N	N	Good writing, oddly pale plot	Pontious Feeb, writer of obscure history books, finds himself without a job and sharing a house with college students a third his age. Desperate for cash, he writes an competent action-adventure novel, but finds himself unable to make a sale because publishers don't think the meek 60 year old would look good on the dust jacket or on book tour. He resorts to deception to get it published, starting a downward spiral that eventually results in the Governor of Minnesota, a beloved local author, and a team of crack Danish spies gunning for him.<br />MST3K alumn Mike Nelson has interesting characters and humorous incident down cold, but the story as a whole left me a bit disappointed. The notion of a nebbishy author hiring an handsome young actor as his public face has a lot of potential, but rather than stay the course of sticking it to the publishing industry Nelson moves the action to rural Minnesota.<br />Not a must read, but probably worth a look if you want something light and funny.	2004-04-28

These non-novels imagined the rise and fall of alien and human civilizations on a canvas that spanned galaxies and billions of years of time.<br />By contrast, _Sirius_, written during World War II and published in 1944, is a story on a much more human scale, despite (as the title suggests) being about a dog. It is a also a far more mature and insightful story than Stapledon's earlier works. It is also a really _sad_ story. . . a genuine tragedy.<br />Sirius, a mastiff / alsatian / border collie mix with a brain enlarged by _in utero_ hormone treatments, is as smart as an above-average human, but retains the senses and instincts of a dog.  His life is not an easy one, despite having loving human step parents and siblings. The novel follows his childhood and education in Wales, his experiences as an anonymous social observer in 1940s London, and his career as a sheep farmer. (What better job for a dog?) We also learn about an affair with his human step-sister, and his painful brooding about his place in the world and the meaning of his strange life.<br />Science fiction usually does not age well. _Sirius_, by contrast, has become even more important and relevant in today's world, where sheep actually get cloned, and mice have been given larger and more convoluted brains through genetic engineering.<br />Contrast _Sirius_ with Kirsten Bakis's _Lives of the Monster Dogs_, which was slicker and brighter but is nowhere near as realistic, insightful, or involving.	2003-09-29

I purchased the original edition of this classic ages ago.<br />This hilarious, elaborate, and merciless satire creates a complete little world: Dacron (motor home capitol of the world), Ohio's  High School, circa 1964. It captures the slightly clunky look-and-feel of school yearbooks, and includes lots of great B&W photos of the classes, clubs, sport teams, and events. Like Matt Groening's _School is Hell_, it is humor with a healthy measure of grim insight and honesty.<br />Fans of \\"National Lampoon's Animal House\\" may find some of the student's names familiar.<br />As a bonus, the last few pages contain ephemera: little forms from the owner's \\"permanent record,\\" pages from a mediocre history book, Dacron High's poetry journal, the school newspaper, and so on.<br />There are some new additions in this special edition, but they're kind of perfunctory: A mock-cutesy \\"What Happened To?\\" newsletter, and an introduction that breaks the versimilitude of the piece.<br />Perhaps there's hope that National Lampoon's equally brilliant, even more elaborate Sunday Newspaper spoof (The Dacron Republican/Democrat) -- which has references to the yearbook -- will be released.	2003-08-20

Indeed, it's apparently been running since before the web was widely available, and going on-line meant dialing in to a service like CompuServe or GEnie. This book is one of a half-dozen or so printed collections. All of the strips are available on-line, but they're much more readable on paper.<br />At first glance, K&K appears to be a computer humor strip with \\"funny animal\\" characters. Closer reading reveals more. It's set in an interesting alternate universe where intelligent carnivores and herbivores of various species uneasily share a common civilization. The Kevin of the title is a giant rabbit; Kell, a wolf. They're married, which raises a lot of eyebrows, and occasionally vexes their children-of-previous-marriages.<br />Some of the strips are one-shot gags; most follow Kevin, Kell, and their kids as they deal with each other and schoolmates, coworkers, and etc. The continuing plotlines can be rather complex and harken back to events that took place years earlier.<br />Another mild downside: A lot of the computer humor is rather dated.	2003-07-24

They've appeared in many places, including his own comic book and an edition of the Whole Earth Catalog. This nicely produced hardcover collects all two-dozen-odd FRANK adventures, with a few new pieces, an afterward by Woodring, and an introduction by (!) Francis Ford Coppola (!).<br />FRANK is an odd little fellow: A generic funny animal, a bit like a cat, a bit like a bear, a bit like a chipmunk. He's usually mild mannered and curious, but is capable of great compassion and fits of violent temper.<br />Frank's world is rich and strange: A wilderness dotted with exotic buildings and very odd creatures, such as the id-driven Manhog, the Jivas (spirit-creatures that look as though they were cut on a lathe), and the menacing, demon-like Whim. It's all very dream-like; sometimes nightmarish, sometimes charming, always intriguing.<br />Frank's adventures are entirely pantomime, with written words confined to an occasional sign or letter (or ransom note...). They range from one page vignettes (\\"In the Mood\\") to epics like \\"Frank's High Horse\\" and \\"Frank's Real Pa.\\" Some (\\"Frank in the River\\") are interesting little adventures; some are humorous; a few are terribly disturbing (\\"The Palace of Horrors\\").<br />Most of the strips are in wonderfully elaborate and evocative black-and-white. The color strips appear shockingly lurid in contrast.<br />I adore FRANK and had no trouble paying for this volume despite owning two previous (and now redundant) collections. But I suspect his adventures may not appeal to everyone. The easily freaked-out may find them positively creepy. A few sample FRANK strips are available on Woodring's website (dub-dub-dub dot jimwoodring dot com); I suggest checking them out before leaping in.	2003-07-11

I gave some copies to friends, but most went to my co-workers at a small home-PC company. It was a coolness test. People who talked about it, who GOT it, I had hope for. Those who didn't get it, or scoffed, I marked as duffers. Alas, this included many of the company's higher ups.<br />Why only four stars for what was once an utterly invaluable tome, a source of inspiration, a shining literary beacon of hope? Mostly because much of what Computer Lib / Dream Machines advocated has come to pass (albeit in ways that Nelson would probably not prefer). Partially because the battle to complete the job has moved into other spheres: Legal, commercial, and the nitty-gritty work of actual product creation.<br />If you see a copy, or either edition, BUY IT.	2002-12-11

This is not light, popular science reading.

Here's a favorite, from the last chapter:<br />\\"Modern science has imposed upon humanity the necessity for wandering. Its progressive thought and its progressive<br />technology make the transition through time, from generation to generation, a true migration into uncharted seas of adventure.<br />The very benefit of wandering is that it is dangerous and needs skill to avert evils. We must expect, therefore, that the future<br />will disclose dangers.\\"<br />(Here it comes:)<br />\\"It is the business of the future to be dangerous; and it is among the merits of science that it equips the future for its duties.\\"<br />(*P*O*W*!*)<br />\\"The prosperous middle classes, who ruled the nineteenth century, placed an excessive value upon the placidity of existence. They refused to face the necessities for social reform imposed by the new industrial system, and they are now refusing to face the necessities for intellectual reform imposed by the new knowledge.\\"<br />(Same as it ever was!)<br />\\"The middle class pessimism over the future of the world comes from a confusion between civilization and security. In the immediate future there will be less security than in the immediate past, less stability. It must be admitted that there is a degree of instability which is inconsistent with civilization. But, on the whole, the great ages have been unstable ages.\\"<br />Whew.	2002-08-15

He's the president of my old model rocketry club. That said, I'll try to do a fair review.<br />To start: Add a star if you build model spaceships, static or flying!<br />The _Spaceship Handbook_ is a huge book. It's college-textbook sized, and densely packed with text and illustrations. The formatting and editing are spotty in parts, but the author includes a mail-in form where readers can list typos and errors. None of these problems detract at all from the usefulness and entertainment value of the book.<br />As the title suggests, this is a book about spaceships. Some are the pipedreams of early pioneers such as Hermann Oberth and Tsiolkovsy. Others are based on magazine articles, TV documentaries, and books of the \\"glory days\\" of the classic spaceship, the 1950s. A large and fascinating section explores the almost forgotten genre of 1950s television space operas, such as Captain Video and Rocky Jones. There are also ships from movies and comic strips, as well as \\"might have beens\\" (the Air Force MOL space station, the Dyna-Soar) that in some cases were months from being flown.<br />There are plenty of photographs, and lots of wonderfully rendered scale drawings. I found the authors' comments on how they overcame gaps and inconsistencies in the presentation of the ships interesting. (Hagerty used a micrometer to determine the width of the fins on Tin-Tin's moon rocket.)<br />The _Spaceship Handbook_ includes a fair amount of material about turning the spaceships described into flying models. It isn't intrusive, however, so SF fans and historians with no plans to build models won't feel cheated. Indeed, rocketeers looking for straightforward plans using standard parts won't find them here. However, the pictures of modeler's wonderful projects might inspire you to break out your drafting gear and wood lathe.<br />As a sort of bonus, The _Spaceship Handbook_ includes as an appendix a large essay by Jon Rogers on atomic-powered spaceships. It's actually a good general survey on interplanetary travel and rocket science. The pros and cons of various systems (ion drives, fission and fusion rockets, Orion drive) are descibed, although not in as much detail as I'd like. I think this appendix deserves to be fleshed out a bit and printed as its own book!<br />To sum up: There's plenty here for modellers, SF fans, space fans, and historians of the Space Age. Highly recommended.ers on atomic-powered spaceships. It's actually a good general survey on interplanetary travel and rocket science.

It is partially set in the fictional midwestern state of Winnemac, and George Babbit makes a cameo appearance. This time around, we see the state of the medical profession, from the practice of a small-town doctor to high-end clinics and public health offices. But unlike George Babbit or the hilarious scoundrel Gantry, Martin Arrowsmith M.D. is someone with ideals. He's no saint; he occasionally neglects an understanding wife and &quot;blows&quot; many opportunities to advance his career by spending too much time in a lab, persuing basic research.<br />But Martin eventually does succeed on his own terms, idealism intact, a rare victory for a Lewis character.<br />_Arrowsmith_ was definitely a slog compared to _Babbit_ or _Elmer Gantry_. There are plenty of satirical bits, but they are fewer and far between. Those interested in the nitty-gritty of medicine and scientific research before electronic gear, electron microscropes, and computers might forgive the relatively slow pace.	2002-01-24

It's a scholarly work, written while Eiseley was wearing his Professor hat instead of his Philosopher cap. It's a comprehensive (but very readable) look at the intellectual climate in which Charles Darwin was educated and scentific traditions of the time.<br />Like any good history of science, _Darwin's Century_ clears away a lot of the mythological gleam surrounding Darwin's great realization. It shows us that, despite the genuine controversy the publication of the theory engendered, that _evolution evolved_. The seeds of the idea were all around.<br />Indeed, much of the ideological &quot;flavor&quot; we associate with evolution arises not from the theory itself, but were inherited from these ur-notions, such as the Great Chain of Being and Malthus's writings.<br />Put this one on your list if you enjoy the work of writers like Stephen Jay Gould and Freeman Dyson.	2001-12-19

The aristocracy of Ventus's vaguely medieval civilization are those who are able to influence the Winds, machine intelligences responsible for maintaining the world's delicately balanced ecosphere.  A bit of magic is provided in the form of nanotech devices woven into the flora, fauna, and landscape.<br />As long as the book is, I wish a bit more time was spent looking at the society from the point of view of the inhabitants. As it happens, our viewpoint native, Jason, soon finds himself drafted by off-world mercenaries who have come to Ventus to hunt down the last remnants of a menacing superbeing. We get brief and tantalizing glimpses of a interstellar civilization, perhaps influenced by Vernor Vinge's space opera but unique enough to be interesting.<br />Despite these nits, I highly recommend this one, and look forward to more by Schroeder.	2001-12-14

Daniel Pinkwater is best known for his childrens' and young adults' books. Really odd and off-beat stuff, best enjoyed by kids destined not to be consumer drones and conformists.<br />I once talked with an editor who knew Mr. Pinkwater. I asked him what he was up to. &quot;He's said he's doing a book for adults,&quot; replied the fellow, &quot;Which could be really scary, because it could have sex in it. Can you imagine Pinkwater writing about sex?&quot;  Hmmmm . . .<br />_The Afterlife Diet_ is indeed his first novel for grown-ups (although he's written for adults before, in his collections of fine essays and reminscences). It could be called a &quot;fat lib&quot; book. Most of its characters are great big folks. Some are alive, some are dead. We see them dealing with the afterlife (it's segregated; The Other Side for hefty folks appears to be an indifferently run Borscht Belt resort), with dating, and careers. It does have sex, although nothing explicit, although we learn enough to know that it takes place in a tub of hot water infused with hot-dog spices.<br /><br />There are a lot of cool characters and situations here here, such as a psychiatrist who conducts therapy sessions in a deli, and a crazed fat-doctor. A lot of the pain expressed must come from personal experience. But a good chunk of the book reads as though it were filler. There are bits about a gummy alien, and an outline for a sprawling SF epic set in the vast parking lot of a interstellar retail complex. Much of this is funny, but it doesn't quite fit in.<br />I ultimately enjoyed this one, and hope The Captain writes another book for grownups.	2001-12-14

When I saw &quot;Marketing Mistakes&quot; (1976) for sale at a thrift shop, I snapped it up.<br />This is actually interesting stuff for anyone interested in the growth and death of businesses, not just for marketing majors.<br />The eleven case studies describe how a retailer (e.g., Montgomery Ward, which finally augered in last year, and Korvette, a discount chain I barely recollect), product (Du Pont's Corfam, an artificial leather), or grand old toy company (A.C. Gilbert) became moribund or outright crashed and burned.<br />There was a lot of nostalgia value in these for me. The names and histories evoked memories of advertising campaigns and jingles. Particularly poignant: The terrible last years of A.C. Gilbert, the august maker of chemistry sets and erector sets. They diluted the company name and ruined its reputation by expanding into girl's toys, infant's toys, and cheap discount-market items. Their decline was amazingly swift.<br />There are lots of lessons here for budding business folk, and for others an opportunity to understand why your favorite stores and products sometimes disappear.	2001-12-05

See below!)<br />How did human cultures and mores arise? _Tribes_, a specialized sort of roleplaying game, attempts to answer it through play and experimentation.<br />_Tribes_ was created by SF author David Brin, and game designing legend Steve Jackson. It's a physically minimal game, with paper components. If you're interested in PLAY of game, and don't mind the lack of slick or commercial production, add a half-star!<br />The players -- I'd say you need at least six, while twelve is too many -- represent members of a tribe of early humans. The winners (one male, one female) are the ones who end the game with the most surviving children. (An early version of the game was called &quot;Darwinopoly.&quot;)<br />The game is played on a very simple board with four regions (plains, hills, swamp, forest) each of which has a different variety of plants and animals to hunt or gather. Much of the playing surface is occupied by charts and tables, e.g., a timeline to determine how far along your kids are toward maturity.<br />In each round, players decide whether they're going to spend their time hunting, gathering, guarding children (there are hyeanas about), and making craft items (baskets or spear points). Also, they decide who they're going to sleep with! Successful mating means the female character gets pregnant, of course.<br />This is a VERY social game. Lots of arguing and bargaining occur. The games I've played (I was a playtester) were all VERY enjoyable. The game is successfull in that, from a simple set of game rules, _social_ rules emerge.<br />_Tribes_ isn't something you'll play super-often. It's something to have fun with once in a while. The good news is it's easy to learn, so you can spring it on friends and acquaintances who might not normally be into a role-playing game.  Add another half-star if this doesn't bother you.	2001-11-13

It celebrates competency, skill, and diversity.	2001-11-08

I'm pretty much convinced that McCloud knows what of which he draws, but even if this dazzling analysis of past, present, and potential future of comics is balderdash, it's wonderfully entertaining and persuasive balderdash that's a wonderful read in its own right.<br />I especially recommend this if you _don't like_ comics or think they're beneath you. That largely described me! I can't say that it converted me into a fan who hangs around shops waiting for tne new issue of ___ to come in, but since reading _Understanding Comics_ I'm open to the idea that there's Something There.<br />Read this in chunks; the 'memetic load' is something fearsome and taking in more than a chapter at a sitting is asking for serious brain hurt.	2001-10-18

I think he makes a good case -- some really amazing online comics are starting to appear -- but it does take him a long time to do it.<br />Many parts of _Reinventing Comics_ are just as brilliant and well-crafted as _Understanding Comics_, but as a whole it's a bit long and not as well paced as the first book.	2001-10-18

These books are collections of Murray Ball's long-running (now ended) newspaper comic of the same name. They're about life in rural New Zealand, as seen by a sheepdog, Dog (he won't let anyone say his real name, bestowed on him by his owner Wal's aunt).<br />There are perhaps two dozen collections of _Footrot Flats_ B&amp;W daily strips and at least eight larger-format &quot;weekender&quot; collections. I have about a half-dozen total, and I've enjoyed them all.<br />This isn't a kiddy strip; it is literally barnyard humor, with lots of dead critters, critters giving birth, rampaging horny sows, cow pies, and other matter-of-fact details of farm life. Given that, it's very funny stuff, with vivid characters and authentic local detail.<br />For American readers, a lot of the fun will come from figuring out the slang.	2001-10-10

The interiors may be remodeled, roofs raised, additions made, plumbing and wiring added, rerouted or remodeled, &amp; etc. Single-family brownstones become apartment buildings, homely warehouses may become lofts for artists and high-tech startups, and mansions may be turned into museums.<br />Good buildings can be changed gracefully; bad ones resist change. Brand shows us many examples of each. In many cases, &quot;vernacular&quot; architecture -- rather plain structures that wouldn't earn a place in an architect's resume -- prove the most suited to change. Brand reserves considerable fury for prestiege projects that seem more to serve the architect's ego than the inhabitants' practical use.<br />I'm not an architect, student of architecture, or what-have-you, so I don't know how this book ranks with other critiques of architecture. I can say that I found it immenseley informative, persuasive, and readable.	2001-10-10

Despite having a great speaking voice and dominating personality he has no interest in persuing a career as a minister. Peer pressure leads him to try, and he soon finds himself attending divinity school and headed to life as a man of the cloth.<br />Elmer's character can be summed up by once incident. After getting a doubt-ridden professor fired, someone leaves 30 dimes wrapped in a religious tract in Elmer's dorm room. He delightedly mines the tract for sermon ideas, and uses the 30 dimes to buy naughty postcards.<br />Besides following the rise, fall, and rise of hard working, talented, and utterly unprincipled Elmer, Sinclair Lewis's novel shows us the state of evangelical religion in the first decades of the 20th Century. We see back-country Baptist churches, traveling revival shows, &quot;New Age&quot; cults, and middle-of-the road Methodist congregations at work.<br />It's funny, and hair-raising, stuff. There's also a nice twist ending that puts it in the category of an Awful Warning novel.	2001-09-24

The gallery carried pictures and copy from recipie books of the 1930s through 1970s.<br />Not the practical sort of recipie books with advice and instructions on putting together wholesome solid food. Horrific _corporate_ cookbooks. Cookbooks from 7-Up, and Swanson, and the National Rice Council. Cookbooks full of pictures of dishes that defy belief. _Things_ made from aspic, the colorless jelly so blissfully absent from modern cuisine. _Things_ with textures and colors out of a Lovecraft novel. _Things_ made with lard and Cream of Mushroom Soup and corn starch.<br />Lileks's snarky commentary is utterly hilarious. The best bits: Stories that flesh out the background of characters in ad campaigns and cookbooks, like the saga of Aunt Jenny, the Spry shortening spokeswoman.<br />This book is the result of years of polishing and picking material from that site.

Babbit is a community booster, civic club member, and proud family man. He has an electric cigar lighter in his car and a fashionable sleeping porch on his house. Just the sort of citizen beloved by the Chamber of Commerce.<br />After describing the details of George's happy, respectable, and utterly unexamined existence, Lewis throws wrenches into the works. An old friend goes off-kilter. Bored by evenings at home with his rather bland wife, George starts hanging out with a fast and loose crowd. He tries out &quot;liberal ideas&quot; in the way that he might try out a new suit, and flirts with the idea of dumping his suburban existence and living in the woods.<br />George comes off as a hapless boob, vaguely aware that things are terribly wrong with his life and society but unable to effectively deal with them.<br />Some of the issues Lewis addresses are a bit dated, but _Babbit_ remains an interesting look at American society. Of note is the cringe-inducing lot of married women, and the lost world of railway travel.	2001-08-30

Such a nice young lady; such an amazingly NASTY novel! Some mature teens and non-&quot;sensitive&quot; adults will find this utterly fascinating and pleasantly hair-raising. Others will be equally utterly repelled and perhaps outraged.<br />_Cruddy_ alternates between two plot threads: One covering the last few hours of the narrator's life, the other her experiences as a ten year old kidnapped by (or dumped on?) on her psychotic father.<br />The current-day Roberta is a messed-up, directionless teen preyed on by equally messed-up teen boys.

It's essentially a cut-down version of Stine's classic Handbook of Model Rocketry. It covers launch systems, motor classification, construction and finishing, and other basics.<br />The Manual appears to have been written for the MPC (Model Products Corporation) model rocketry division; most of the rockets shown are MPC kits. Stine also plugs the MPC line in subtle ways.<br />This is a nice, basic introduction to the hobby, easier to digest than the Handbook. I doubt it will every be reprinted, however, and shouldn't be looked on as anything more than a collectable curiosity.<br />ADDENDUM:<br />Since writing the above, I've discovered a later edition of this book.

With time, he learns to master his superhuman intelligence and develop telepathic powers which allow him to find others of his kind. By the end of the book, he and his band of superhuman mutants are trying to create a new civilization on an isolated island.<br />This is an early novel, and to some extent it shows. A lot of Stapledon's views of what a highly intelligent creature would be like and do with his time seem awfully cliched today; there are odd parallels with Stapledon's thinking and some current-day &quot;New Age&quot; thinking. But it may be that _Odd John_ created those cliches! Stapledon was an immensely influential writer in 1930s Britain.<br />Wonderful Trivia: The copyright for Odd John is held by George Pal . . . the filmmaker who brought us the movie versions of &quot;The Time Machine&quot; and &quot;War of the Worlds.&quot; Forrey Ackerman told me that Pal had hopes and plans to film _Odd John._ Oh, what might have been!<br />_Sirius_, written during World War II and published in 1944, is a far more mature and insightful work. It is also a really _sad_ book . . . a genuine tragedy.<br />As the title suggests, it's about a dog; a mastiff / alsatian / border collie mix with a brain enlarged by _in utero_ hormone treatments. Sirius is as smart as an above-average human, but with the senses and instincts of a dog.<br />Sirius' life is not easy, despite having loving &quot;step parents&quot; and siblings. The novel follows his childhood and education in Wales, his experiences as an anonymous social observer in 1940s London, and his career as a sheep farmer. (What better job for a dog?) We also learn about his affair with his human step-sister, and his painful brooding about his place in the world and the meaning of his strange life.<br />Contrast _Sirius_ with Kirsten Bakis's _Lives of the Monster Dogs_, which was slicker and brighter but is no where near as realistic, insightful or involving._Sirius_ with Kirsten Bakis's _Lives of the Monster Dogs_, which was slicker and brighter but is no where near as realistic, insightful or involving.	2001-05-12

There are only a few lines of dialogue, and most characters stick around for maybe a paragraph or two. Last and First Men is best thought of as a future history. Not the history of America or Western Civilization, but of the human species. Two billion years of it.<br />Fair Warning: Stapledon, an intellectural pacifist and survivor of the hideous spectacle of World War One, lets his prejudices and peculiarities show in the first five or so chapters of the book. He predicts a second (and further) world wars, but gets the details spectacularly wrong. America gets its knocks, but for reasons that are entirely unfair; Stapledon's beliefs about american society are bizarre and off-base. He later apologized and admitted that these early chapters were rather weak. So . . . if you get this book, you won't hurt your enjoyment of the story if you skip to the section entitled &quot;The Americanized World&quot; and go from there. Now that that's out of the way . . .<br />Last and First Men is written about the big picture. It follows Western civilization until it succumbs to an energy crisis and intellectual stagnation. A successor culture based in Patagonia arises, but an experiment with atomic power blasts it, and much of the land mass of the Earth, into oblivion. A few arctic explorers survive, but by the time humanity regains a technological civilization it has evolved into a sturdier, larger species . . . the &quot;second men.&quot; These potentially superior creatures find themselves threatened by an invasion from Mars . . . and such martians they are! Mass-minded creatures composed of millions of airborne cells, they and humanity are simply too alien to comprehend each other. Stapledon spends chapters discussing the social, moral and spiritual nature of the Martian swarms, comparing their odd society with humanity's.<br />The Second Men fall, and are replaced through natural evolution by Third, who create the Fourth . . . and so on, through interplantary migration, cosmic disaster, terraforming, hideous wars, spiritual triumph and decadence, until the Seventeenth Men arise on Neptune and face the end of human history. This is one of the most deeply considered pieces of science fiction every written, and a must-read for any serious scholar of the genre. It is dated in spots, and oddly colored by pre-war Lefty english politics, but these minor flaws do not greatly detract from its scope and majesty.<br />STAR MAKER<br />As if Last and First Men were not enough, Stapledon takes on the history of an entire galactic civilization in Star Maker (published 1938). The book -- again, not so much a novel as a sort of narrative history -- begins with the narrator fleeing a domestic argument and walking to the top of a hill to gaze at the stars. He finds himself &quot;astrally projecting&quot; and soon discovers another world, populated by roughly humanoid creatures.<br />After telepathically joining with a sympathetic native, he explores the world and its troubled civilizations. After disaster and folly doom the planet, the narrator and his guide find themselves whisked to another troubled world, and another, and so on, each populated by stranger and stranger creatures with more and more esoteric mental and spiritual natures. Star Maker soon turns from the fate of individual worlds to the big picture; the two-billion year long history of humanity rates about two paragraphs.<br />In a series of dazzling chapters Stapledon describes the construction of artificial worlds, space travel by wandering space colonies, and spectacular interstellar wars. Strife and religious bigotry lead to genocide through artificially induced novas; lesser races fall prey to technologically advanced but spiritually misguided &quot;pervert&quot; races. After several millenia, a true galactic civilization arises and begins organizing itself into a Galactic Mind to root out the deepest questions of existence.<br />This final quest -- to confront the Prime Mover behind the existence of the universe and reality -- requires a rather long time; at one point further progess seems threatened by the heat death of the universe.<br />Mind-blowing stuff. Species form utopias -- some benign and non-interventionist, some insane -- and travel the galaxy in flying planets. Stars are surrounded by globes of artificial habitats (the inspiration for &quot;Dyson Spheres&quot;).<br />Reading Star Maker is an exhausting and humbling experience. Stapledon rattles off ideas and concepts that didn't make it into mainstream SF until the last decade or so. It is mighty difficult to be impressed by normal science fiction after reading<br />this book.ins organizing itself into a Galactic Mind to root out the deepest questions of existence.<br />This final quest -- to confront the Prime Mover behind the existence of the universe and reality -- requires a rather long time; at one point further progess seems threatened by the heat death of the universe.<br />Mind-blowing stuff.

The chapters in past collections, like the incomparable  _Disturbing the Universe_, started out as essays and articles; these  transcribed lectures don't quite compare.<br /> If you haven't read anything  by Dyson, you might want to start here. Otherwise, my recommendation is to  buy it, and loan it to people who need beach reading or an airline book.	1999-06-16

It has everything that  endears me to Sterling's writing: imaginative but imaginable futures,  cheeky humor, and a refusal to cleave to SF genre tropes. But this is a  _political_ novel, with a hero who dresses to a tee and rolls his eyes at  socially and stylistically clueless geeks. Science and technology don't  come to the rescue; they just make a hopelessly complex situation more  complex.<br />Campaign director-turned-would-be-national savior Oscar  Valpariso isn't after trancendence or knowledge or personal freedom; he's a  pol, and a driven and somewhat ruthless one at that. I never quite felt  quite comfortable with or sympathetic toward the guy, probably because I'm  a confirmed geek.<br />But _Distraction_ is a welcome return to the sort of  near-future politically savvy SF novel that hasn't been seen much since  Pohl and Kornbluth (_Gladiator at Law_) stopped collaborating, or at least  since Brunner's hair-raising near future novels (_The Sheep Look Up_,  _Stand on Zanzibar_). Most of the current political SF I'm aware of is of  the fan-pleasing miraculous-libertarian-revolution variety. This one deals  with politics in a world on the verge of becoming deeply strange, thanks to  advances in neurology that threaten, or promise, to forever change human  nature.<br />Sterling pulls off a difficult task, mostly. The ideas didn't  keep me up nights, the way some of the notions in _Holy Fire_ did. A lot of  the details of his Greenhouse-afflicted, economically-pummeled, fractious  U.S. are told rather than being shown, rendering it kind of flat in spots.  This is also a very talky novel . . . but, hey, that's what politics is  about, yah? And a lot of the talk is pretty fascinating.<br />At the very  least, _Distraction_ shows Sterling's flexibility. It is nothing like the  wonder-filled _Holy Fire_, or the brooding _Difference Engine_.<br />--Stefan Jonesthing like the  wonder-filled _Holy Fire_, or the brooding _Difference Engine_.    <br />--Stefan Jones	1998-12-31

Familiar Pinkwater territory	Robert Nifkin, socially awkward son of eccentric immigrants, finds himself  an inmate in a god-awful Chicago high school staffed by incompetent,  bigoted, intolerant teachers.  With the help of fellow free-thinking  oddballs, Robert discovers 1950s Chicago bohemia and the benefits of self  education. Great digs at vapid consumer culture and intellectual conformity  are made along the way.<br /> Though arguably Pinkwater's best written and  best paced work to date, I couldn't help feeling I'd read most of this  before.  Nifkin's Chicago will be very familiar territory to fans of _The  Snarkout Boys_ books and Pinkwater's autobiographical essay  collections.<br /> The most serious problem with _The Education of Robert  Nifkin_ is it's length. It ended far too soon, darn it!<br /> Uptight parents  offended by the idea of a teenager cutting classes and smoking cigars  should buy this one for their kids anyway and lighten up a bit.<br />  --Stefan Jones	1998-09-25

The resulting essays are wonderfully written, profound, and convincing.<br />As the title suggests, Dyson uses scenarios from science fiction and futurism as starting points and milestones in his discussions. He manages to work both _Jurassic Park_ and Stapledon's _Last and First Men_ into Chapter 3, which is about genetic engineering.<br />Chapter 4, Evolution, is a jarring trip through history past and present.<br />Aw, hell.

Makes most books about these subject seem as deep as articles in _People_.<br />I quote one of these essays, &quot;Flying Saucers and Little Green Men,&quot; on my home page:<br />&quot;Darwin saw clearly that the succession of life on this planet was not a formal pattern imposed from without, or moving exclusively in one direction. Whatever else life might be, it was adjustable and not fixed. It worked its way through difficult environments. It modified and then, if necessary, it modified again, along roads which would never be retraced. Every creature alive is the product of a unique history. The statistical probability of its precise reduplication on another planet is so small as to be meaningless. Life, even cellular life, may exist out yonder in the dark. But high or low in nature, it will not wear the shape of man. That shape is the evolutionary product of a strange, long wandering through the attics of the forest roof, and so great are the chances of failure, that nothing precisely and indentically human is ever to come that way again.&quot;<br />&quot;In a universe whose size is beyond human imagining, where our world floats like a dust mote in the void of night, men have grown inconceivably lonely. We scan the time scale and the mechanism of life itself for portents and signs of the invisible. As the only thinking mammals on the planet -- perhaps the only thinking animals in the entire sidereal universe -- the burden of consciousness has grown heavy upon us. We watch the stars, but the signs are uncertain. We uncover the bones of the past and seek for our origins. There is a path there, but it appears to wander. The vagaries of the road may have a meaning, however; it is thus we torture ourselves.&quot;<br />&quot;Lights come and go in the night sky. Men, troubled at last by the things they build, may toss in their sleep and dream bad dreams, or lie awake while the meteors whisper greely overhead. But nowhere in all space or on a thousand worlds will there be men to share our loneliness. There may be wisdom; there may be power; somewhere across space great instruments, handled by strange manipulative organs, may stare vainly at our floating cloud wrack, their owners yearning as we yearn. Nevertheless, in the nature of life and in the principles of evolution we have had our answer. Of men elsewhere, and beyond, there will be none forever.&quot;<br />-- Loren Eiseley, &quot;Little Men and Flying Saucers,&quot; The Immense Journey<br />There is more bleak majesty and wisdom in these three paragraphs than in any hundred science fiction novels. It also neatly summarizes Stephen Jay Gould's arguments from _Wonderful Life_.<br />I rarely give out &quot;10s&quot;. This book is seriously wonderful.<br />--Stefan Jonesverhead.

He is a keen observer of science as it is actually conducted, and a strong advocate of scientific ethics and social responsibility.<br />The essays in _Disturbing the Universe_ describe Dyson's life and career, with asides on space colonization, the environment, arms control, and spirituality.<br />This is absolutely top-notch stuff. Dyson can out-imagine most SF authors: His vision of life spreading through the galaxy via organisms adapted to the vaccuum and cold of deep space is wonderous and convincing.<br />An absolute MUST for futurists and environmentalists.

The book -- again, not so much a novel as a sort of narrative history -- begins with the narrator fleeing a domestic argument and walking to the top of a hill to gaze at the stars. He finds himself &quot;astrally projecting&quot; and soon discovers another world, populated by roughly humanoid creatures. After telepathically joining with a sympathetic native, he explores the world and its troubled civilizations.<br />After disaster and folly doom the planet, the narrator and his guide find themselves whisked to another troubled world, and another, and so on, each populated by stranger and stranger creatures with more and more esoteric mental and spiritual natures. Star Maker soon turns from the fate of individual worlds to the big picture; the two-billion year long history of humanity rates about two paragraphs. In a series of dazzling chapters Stapledon describes the construction of artificial worlds, space travel by wandering space colonies, and spectacular interstellar wars. Strife and religious bigotry lead to genocide through rtificially induced novas; lesser races fall prey to technologically advanced but spiritually misguided &quot;pervert&quot; races. After several millenia, a true galactic civilization arises and begins organizing itself into a Galactic Mind to root out the deepest questions of existence. This final quest -- to confront the Prime Mover behind the existence of the universe and reality -- requires a rather long time; at one point further progess seems threatened by the heat death of the universe.<br />What the Cosmic Mind -- the combined mentalities of all living creatures since the birth of the galaxies -- eventually<br />discovers is bleak and terrible and wondrous.<br />Reading Star Maker is an exhausting and humbling experience. Stapledon rattles off ideas and concepts that didn't make it into mainstream SF until the last decade or so.

There are only a few lines of dialogue, and most characters stick<br /> around for maybe a paragraph or two. Last and First Men is best thought of as a future history.<br /> Not the history of America or Western Civilization, but of the human species. Two billion years<br /> of it.<br /><br />&lt;I&gt;Fair Warning: Stapledon, an intellectural pacifist and survivor of the hideous spectacle of<br /> World War One, lets his prejudices and peculiarities show in the first five or so chapters of<br /> the book. He predicts a second (and further) world wars, but gets the details spectacularly<br /> wrong. America gets its knocks, but for reasons that are entirely unfair; Stapledon's beliefs<br /> about american society are bizarre and off-base. He later apologized and admitted that<br /> these early chapters were rather weak.
