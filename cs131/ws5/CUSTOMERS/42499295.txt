In 1975 America was in retreat. It had abandoned its allies in Indochina, it had not long before prevented Israel from properly winning a war, it's president refused to meet Solzhenitsyn lest it's enemies would be distracted from meeting with Angela Davis, and it allowed with but an occasional whimper the hypocritical UN majority, either through Soviet instruction or reflex or both, to slap about America and its ideals. Then came Moynihan. For eight months he held those who castigated and damned us to account. It now seems simple good sense: those who would slaughter rival tribes in Burundi and those who operated Gulag cannot get away with UN shoe-banging in protest of America's free (and elected) association with Puerto Rico or of Israel's right to exist without its pre-schools having to hose human remains off its playgrounds. But then it was actually a big deal--the New York Times quivered whenever he approached a UN microphone. The late ambassador does not in my opinion write in a style too complex for the casual reader; in fact, his Irish wit and grasp of English make this a universal volume for anyone with an interest in foreign policy as well as those who appreciate truth telling.	2003-09-18

We think of Saddam defying the civilized world, we think of North Vietnam using the Kissinger treaty to overrun the south, we think of Anna Nicole with a case of Nesquick--Franklin would certainly try to charm Stalin and he would lose. That America tried to shmooz the communists instead of confront them certanly prolonged the cold war. If Frankin had not thought he could grin the reds into an decent deal, millions would have been free sooner. Crocker gives us Roosevelt's idiotic attempt at such idiocy a full hearing, and finds him a jackass.	2003-07-14

Bush is, try reading this book. It's fashionable among the ..., intellectuals, and other such brainless folk in America to dismiss this man, at the prompting of such geniuses as the famous war experts at the NY Times (who are amused by his bad habits: honesty, punctuality, and being in proper physical shape, and wite him off as a lightweight). And yet he appears here, in the words of an actual White House correspondent (unlike Woodward), as a man who confronts a worse incident than Pearl Harbor (more were slaughtered on 9/11 than Dec. 7) with an aplomb and grace not seen in a president since FDR's one proud moment on Dec. 8th, 1941 (and certainly not seen in another Democrat since Cleveland's paternity suit). We follow a Dubya resolute and focused; we hear him vowing a deserved revenge in locker room language and see him comforting widows at the Javits Convention Center. I cannot recommend this enough to our presidents friends and enemies--and those in between should pick it up, if only to get out of the middle of the road: there are dead skunks there.	2003-07-14

What is it? A perfect example of there's no such a thing as a bad boy, society is to blame, who can define duty or patriotism, we are all responsible but the criminal, liberalism.... in other words, a mix of Father Flanigan and George McGovern. Yet it is sharply written, if not reasoned, and makes for a compelling story. Slovik certainly wasn't a duty, honor, country sort of fellow. He was a petty criminal--more a follower and delinquent than anything--who spent four years, as an adult, in a Michigan reformatory. He avoided recidivism upon his release, marrying, holding steady jobs, and enjoyng his 4-F status. Then came the barrel-scraping; the need for replacements outweighing previous standards; so Slovik was drafted. And then the whining begins. Reading Sloviks letters to his wife, one is struck by the self-pity. His whimpering is such that I believe Mother Theresa would have wished to slap him. His letters make Bill Clinton seem another Audie Murphy or Joe Foss. He arrived in France in the summer of 1944 and immediately &quot;got lost.&quot; When he finally caught up with his unit--six WEEKS later--he informed his CO that he would desert if put on the line--and desert he did. As jail had once been a comfort for him, the stockade seemed preferable to duty, he turned himself in the next day, writing the confession that almost made his execution a certainty. In it he admitted to cowardice and added in bold print &quot;I'LL RUN AWAY AGAIN.&quot; An officer offered to tear up the confession if Slovik would go on the line. He refused. Yes, he was the only soldier executed for desertion since 1864, and yes, there may have been more egregious examples of cowardice, but Slovik took the decisions that led to his fate. And he whined all the way.	2003-05-11

After his father's death he abandoned the rabbinate and became a full-time comedian, leading to a California gig which itself led to a Steve Allen show appearance which led to recordings which led to what he thought would be the success he craved--but then came a misunderstanding with Ed Sullivan (he says it was a thumb, not a finger) and a stay in a sort lounge-only-act Coventry that led him to despair.

It is an account of Wingate from his service in colonial Palestine to his death in the CIB Theater. We see him working with the Haganah, setting up ambushes of Arab terrorists, much to the hair-pulling rage of his superiors; then to his liberation of Ethiopia, leading a few hundred poorly-armed and -trained locals but with the moral and charismatic power of Selassie (an excellent portrayal) at is side; then to the Chindits and their operations in Burma. Wingate proves to be an irresistable subject: insubordinate, stubborn, reckless, fearless, and egomaniacal, yet tender to his wife and wanting nothing more than to get this damn WWII finished so he can return to fight for Israel's independence. A fascinating man; a brilliant novel.	2002-10-25

He would stroke, promise, betray, and forget politcal debts unlike any man in this dirty business ever thought to do. He promised, for example, a free Poland, and shunted such things to the side, for political expedience called. Lincoln violated the law, Theodore Roosevelt and Taft slapped down the free market, LBJ destroyed free association, Carter (temporarily) crushed America's respect in the world, Clinton gave everyone a reason to laugh at the executive--but Franklin made relativism an art form.

Before George Kennan's formulation  (surrender-on-the-installment-plan) of containment, and WAY before the Reagan/Casey/Kirkland/John Paul II policy of active engagement of Soviet communism, there was roll-back, wherein the west would aggressively seek liberation of sovietized countries. In the forties it seemed Albania was a good spot. If it was or not we wouldn't know, because the Soviet agent Philby, stuttering through bad teeth, had the British buffaloed. His betrayals caused deaths of those seeking liberty all over the world: Russia, Ukraine, Central Europe, and our servicemen in Korea. But here Bethell concentrates on one act: Philby's actions in Albania. Paramilitary forces were to be inserted, Enver Hoxha to be deposed, our natural allies liberated. Instead, the treason of one man left the operation destroyed, the participants slaughtered and or tortured, and Albania cast into decades of marxist darkness.	2002-10-04

Though tragic, Lyons recounts the times with wit and pathos, and with a grasp of English not unlike a cross between Conrad and Nabakov.	2002-09-29

Gibbs, a survivor of the UK Subs, is asked to join the band by Andy McCoy, a Johnny Thunders-inspired fellow from Hanoi Rocks, and then begins a tour that covers small clubs in the hinterland to Texas Stadium to Brazil, Japan, and even parts of the wilds of Canada to New Zealand and Australia. Iggy is married at the time and civilized, and so is merely a ticking time-bomb (as opposed to the usual exploding one), and thus quits cigarettes and hard drinking. (But check out his Miami temptations.) We hear of the life suffered by those forced to live in 5-Star hotels. the horrors of having to say no to groupies, the pain of Iggy taking the author's last bottle of cognac--yet it all adds up to a pleasant and literate read; the work of man who knows what of he speaks and does it well.

Here was a fighter, though he usually used his intellect and sarcasm, who could flatten any opponent. (He was also a professor of anthropology and English, a master carpenter, chess player, and musician.) Jacket copy is almost always worthless, yet here we read a critic who states that he \\"would hate to be as sure of anything as Mr. Greenway is of everything.\\" And truer statements are hard to find. Greenway writes on five subjects: American Indians (decrying revisionism and hagiography), the academy and its students (\\"the dumbest mob of trousered apes ever whelped\\"), modern feminism (using Al Capp's \\"women's lip\\" formulation), the police (in favor), and George Patton (very much in favor). I remember first reading Greenway in National Review and thinking, You CAN'T say that! Well, if such a reaction comes from, well, a reactionary, then treat yourself to this: the humorous and telling observations of a man who knew as much as Erasmus and punched as hard as Dempsey.	2002-09-28

The two years of the author's life covered here were not as compelling as those in the above book, but are just as amusingly written. Foley's humor drips Irish deviltry, not unlike Murray Kempton. From Foley's first title win through his double knee surgery to the Rock 'n' Sock era and  his two retirement matches to the commissionary position he held at the end, Mick shows us the absurdity of a life in the worked arts--and the phoniness he encounters in the so-called real world. Some of us may fault him for returning from his retirement too soon. (I do.) And some may think we could have done without a liberal screed of an afterward.

Herein he takes us through his fifteen years with the Stranglers, documents what they were trying to say and why, and informs us just who Dagenham Dave is (was, actually). His reflections on the band's personalities are quite interesting. Dave Greenfield NEVER heard Ray Manzarek before joining the band. (Really.) Jet was in jazz bands.

He does not, however, mention Paul Hughes, who sold a false story to leading liberals that McCarthy was stashing guns in the Senate basement, and that the New York Post food editor was a right-wing agent. No, Mr. Cook is selective--and an ink blot test of what liberals WANT to believe.

Mr. Shaw, respected, liberal, a gentleman, found himself indicted for conspiracy to kill a president for whom he voted. The nightmare he endured, which left him in near penury, is recounted here. How can such a man endure a trial with witnesses against him who include psychotics, drug addicts, and those who think they have been hypnotised several hundred times by besmirchers of their sex lives? And how can such a man keep his own sanity after such an ordeal? Find out in this excellent book, brilliantly written with humor and pathos.

The thirties were unkind to them, as they started the decade damning such \\"social fascists\\" as FDR, voted for Foster and Ford, then, on orders from Moscow, hailed the liberals as allies in the fight against fascism. Ah, but then Stalin signed a pact with fascism--so back went Franklin to the vituperation pile. (Eleanor was OK.) The war brought about some changes: it was \\"imperialist,\\" and so resistance to Hitler was out of fashion (a word Hellman would disengenuously use later). The Hollywood Anti-Nazi Committee changed its name to something less provocative; those who had whooped for the purge trials moved onto calling for strikes in defense industries. The yanks weren't coming, they said. Then Hitler broke the treaty. The change was immediate. Suddenly the yanks WERE coming, if the intellectualoids of the left had anything to say. Supporting all this, driving this, in fact, were those Hollywood Ten types the left love to tell us were just \\"activists,\\" persecuted innocents. These innocents sided with Stalin and, for a time, Hitler. (Think about that the next time you laud such people.) This book is a true classic.

In this volume, brothers-in-law Buckley and Bozell (with an uncharacteristic lack of humor, but with a surgeon's scalpel) look at McCarthy's charges. From Moss to Lattimore, the dramatis personae and the evidence and the words of McCarthy's critics are laid before us. The conclusions are left to the reader; but the authors make a central point: nothing, EVER, said by McCarthy was as outrageous as those yawped by his critics. This book will inform those who have the Schrecker view of communism (\\"non-traditional patriotism\\"), the Appleton loyalists, as well as those who seek the facts. Recommended.	2002-04-24

It recounts the conflicts--temporal and otherwise--suffered by an eighteen-year-old tossed into the butchery of the final assaults upon nazi Germany late in the war. The Germans are resisting nastily, and the Americans, before the days of thermobaric bombs and a Congress given to polls before strategy, are pushing hard to end the war. The results of such necessary (at the time) savagery are personified here. Young Everett Hackermeyer, a Brooklynite who knew neither love nor humor as a boy, is thrust into such horrors. He, a failure before donning the helmet and grabbing the M1, learns he is adept at soldiery--and, as the realities and blood pass, learns the true meaning of why he is, what he was, and what can be.

His existential stuff is first-rate. But.... But here is Mr. Wright's best. We find here the story of poor Fishbelly, whose father holds the highest position possible for the Mississippi oppressed at the time: undertaker. The events that overtake him strike the reader across the face as rudely as those in previous novels; the civilized are outraged. Read this in the name of liberty.	2002-04-11

Wood, Jr.)	Books	5	5	7	N	N	A Fine Compendium	This oral biography of the late Mr. Wood states things nicely, entertainingly, and with the humor AND respect it requires.  The basis for the Burton picture, it is actually a deserved appreciation of a man derided as a hack who, though it was true, loved the busines, and thus deserves our aforementioned respect.  OK--you can laugh now--as he would have.  Buy this.	2002-03-16

I read this badly reasoned book when it was released back in the seventies. That a man enjoined, as one of the authors was, from digging in Bob Dylan's garbage be considered a serious researcher, much less a target of guffaws, is beyond the limits of my ratiocination.  The thesis here is simple: America is evil, led by such right-wing extremists as lead the Brookings Institution (a big surprise to not only them, but also conservatives), and Mr. Kennedy was removed to remove from a path the sane know he himself supported.  Buy this for a chuckle.  For the assassination, read Posner's book.	2002-03-16
