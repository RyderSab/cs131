I have three kids 9, 6, & 4 and we read Despereaux slowly, a couple of chapters at a time, for many nights.  I've read every night with my kids since my oldest was a baby but this was the first book since Dr. Seuss to truly capture them all at the same time.  The illustrations were fantastic and the characters were such fun and a joy for me to \\"do\\".  Miggery Sow was such a great tragic-comic character and I loved doing her voice and yelling \\"Gor!\\" and giggling along with my kids. <br /> <br />We all laughed and cried and I know this is a classic that we will be re-reading for years to come.  My son hugged me after the final page and said, \\"Thank you so much for reading us Despereaux Mom, that was the best book ever\\" and he slept with the book under his pillow. <br /> <br />We were already big fans of DiCamillo's other books but The Tale of Despereaux is the best reading experience I've ever had with my kids so far.	2004-08-10

There is so much to love in Sheet Music, it's one of those books that has everything that makes reading such an enjoyable experience.  I loved the detailed descriptions of recipes and food.  It had some incredibly sensual scenes and there was a very well planned and executed mystery that made it a page-turner.  <br />However, it was the incredibly accurate portrayal of Sophie's emotional reckoning with the loss of her mother that resonated for me.  As someone who has lost close family members including my mother I was blown away by how accurate author M.J. Rose was at capturing that kind of grief. <br />This was such a great read, enjoy!	2004-04-14

I found myself lost in this poignant and incredibly romantic description of a relationship.  The main character Paul starts with the day his wife is found dead at the bottom of the apple tree in their backyard, apparently an accidental fall, and works backwards as he re-examines how they met and fell in love etc.  It was beautiful look at what makes a couple, why do we love each other, what are we willing to forgive or sacrifice to be with someone we love.<br />Unfortunately for me the book then took a gruesome and completely unnecessary turn about a group of people obsessed with teaching a dog to talk - by any means necessary.  The whole thing felt very manipulative and left a bad taste in my mouth.<br />I think that Parkhurst is an incredibly talented writer and there were some amazing and very descriptive paragraphs in this book that I found myself reading 2 and 3 times but I would have liked it much more if it had left the horror out - it felt all wrong here.  I give one half of the story 5 stars and the other 3 to average out at 4 stars.	2003-10-26

If you love the written word then this is a fascinating and different book in which Mark Dunn pulls off a novel told through written correspondence as slowly different letters of the alphabet are elimated from legal use.  <br />On the small island of Nollop named after the man who invented the sentence &quot;The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog&quot; residents superstitously avoid using the letters of this sentence as the tiles from the monument commemorating it slowly fall one after the other.  Eventually an uprising races to come up with an even shorter sentence using all the letters of the alphabet.  <br />As dry and constraining as the premise sounds this was a funny, quirky and highly enjoyable read.  I give it 4 1/2 stars.	2003-10-23

Time travel and detective novels are not usually the sort of thing I'm drawn to but the dry wit in this novel made it a very enjoyable read for me.  I may have enjoyed the atmosphere more than the story but I found myself giggling at such things as rioting gangs of conflicting art enthusiasts (impressionists against the expressionists) or the idea of seeing Shakespeare's Richard III as a Rocky Horror Picture show experience where the audience joins in for the battle scene.<br />I'm sure this book isn't for everyone but it's impossible to describe and I highly recommend giving it the 50 page test because I know I was surprised.	2003-10-23

Jane is the most self-centered and self-involved character that you'll ever meet but she does have her own logic and she will definitely make you laugh out loud.  Who can argue that everyone deserves to be treated as well as a pregnant woman, Jane just wants to bask in the glow and live in the rosy world that pregnant women live in - what's wrong with that?  You'll read right up to the last few pages as Jane approaches the end of her 9th month and you'll never guess how Baratz-Logsted can possibly end this crazy ride but she pulls it off with flair.  A fun, silly, witty, take you out of your day to day doldrums kind of book - I give it 4 1/2 stars.	2003-09-09

The fun is in all the little revelations about art, science and religion that Dan Brown offers up.  Although I feel he may have taken some literary license with the facts, I still enjoyed this book much more than what the average pop fiction novel has to offer.<br />Read it for fun and not for the facts - a great summer page-turner.	2003-08-11

I truly believe there is a magic and a mystery to human language.  <br />What I didn't expect to get from this book was such a great story about the fragile cohesiveness of family.  I found it fascinating to watch how when the daughter's position in the family shifted from forgotten child to center of attention and father's favorite it had devastating reverberations through the entire family.

I can't believe I'm the first person to review this incredible novel.  If you like your fiction with a touch of the surreal you'll love this book.

It moves on to the central character's childhood in a racially divided Detroit of the 1960's and ends with her coming to terms with her sexual identity in the 1970's.<br />This novel was an amazing study on divisions in class, race, culture, generation, and obviously sex.

This is a story about belonging to a group of friends who truly care about each other, something we all wish we had growing up and pray our children will find.<br />Each girl has her own struggle to deal with during this summer of the \\"magic\\" blue jeans but it is their connection to each other and the simple knowledge that they have friends to fall back on that makes it such a magical story.<br />I would especially like to applaud Brashares for dealing with one character's first sexual experience with such honesty and without sensationalism.  Bridget is not some helpless or foolish child but a young woman who thinks she knows what she wants and then is overwhelmed by the intimacy of what she's gotten herself into.  As an aunt I was glad to be able to have this story as a way to discuss all those raging teenage hormones and what giving yourself to another person can really mean.<br />This was a fantastic book, not just for young adults but beware of recommending it to those under 13.	2003-02-07

This is not a fast-paced or thrilling western but a story about human nature, survival and choices in awful circumstances.<br />In 1920's Hollywood reclusive millionaire movie mogul Damon Ira Chance of Best Chance Pictures wants to make the great American Movie in the manner of his idol D.W. Griffith.  He has picked an extra out of a western who is rumoured to be a &quot;real&quot; old-time cowboy.  Shorty McAdoo is an old man with a rugged past and has supposedly fought Indians and Chance wants his story.  Harry Vincent, a quiet loner title writer at Best Chance, is enlisted by Chance to get McAdoo's tale.  The story Harry gets of McAdoo's part in the Cyprus Hills Massacre in 1867(?) is not the heroic pioneering tale expected.<br />The settling of the old west was full of these small but significant battles where the choices of a few had an effect on many.  Even as you read closer to the horrifying battle of the 1800's and the amazing climax of the 1920's you'll wonder how much of Shorty's life was his choice and how much is fate and circumstance.	2003-02-04

Austin Clarke was the underdog against such big hitters as Wayne Johnston and Carol Shields but I found The Polished Hoe to be a long rambling tale with an unsatisfying climax.<BR> <BR>Mary Gertrude Mathilda Bellfeels, a plantation field worker who luckily or unluckily caught the favor of the plantation manager Mr. Bellfeels becomes his mistress and bears him his only son. As a reward she lives and raises her son (he grows up to become the village doctor) in the Great House and no longer has to work other than being little more than a [mistress] to a man you come to truly hate. <br />The novel covers one long night of Mary giving her statement to a Sargent who has loved her from afar since they were both only 10 years old. In the build up to her crime, what she did and why she did it, we get the story of her almost 60 years on the plantation through anecdotes of the horrors of black life in the village of Bimshire in the West Indies where blacks are still treated like slaves even if they work for a wage. <br />The problem for me was that this book rambled over the same territory continually and although some of the history was compelling this novel lacked a continuity or a narrative that kept you wanting to read on. The carrot is that you know she's probably killed someone with that hoe she used to use in the north field but you don't find out who and why until the last 10 pages of the book and by then I just wanted to be done. <br />This is a good book for a sense of place, time and culture but don't look for a great love story or a novel of suspense in The Polished Hoe.	2003-01-26

Lucy's plan to run off and stay with a beloved servant to show her parents how badly she doesn't want to move backfires when she breaks her leg in the woods.  Her parents find some of her clothing on the beach and incorrectly assume she has drowned.  Heartbroken they leave their home and travel through Europe leaving no forwarding address.  Lucy is eventually found and has to live with the guilt of having caused everyone, including herself, such heartbreak.  The problem is she never forgives herself, she denies herself the right to any sort of happiness and it became difficult to continue to sympathize with a character so utterly guilt ridden.  Maybe I should have enjoyed the departure from a typical happy ending but this book could have used one.	2003-01-15

She then had the brilliant idea to wrap short stories around antique drawings, 100 year old catalogue pictures and illustrations from the original Gray's Anatomy.

She's a doctor with decidedly liberal leanings and is considered the &quot;good&quot; one in the marriage only now she's having an affair.  He's a columnist known as &quot;the angriest man in Holloway&quot; and makes a living by ranting about everything and everyone - he's not easy to live with.  To annoy his physician wife he decides to see a faith healer known as GoodNews about his bad back and ends up coming away a changed man.  He forgives his wife and decides to give away many of their possessions (including his son's computer because they don't need two).  He starts a community program to encourage his neighbors to take in homeless teenagers and basically begins to try and convince his wife that it's their duty to change the world and make it a better place.  She's now forced to decide just how good do you have to be in order to be a good person, she doesn't want a homeless kid in the house and she's worked hard for the things they have but how do you say no.  I read this book right after reading Carol Sheild's Unless and I thought this was a much more truthful look at what it means to be good and how much self sacrifice is too much.	2003-01-15

A hostage taking just can not end well but you'll find yourself praying that it will.<br />In some third world South American country guerillas have taken over the Vice President's home and end up keeping 60+ V.I.P.'s and one internationally famous soprano hostage for four months.  Incredibly, they begin to build a routine that becomes almost utopian for some of the terrorists and hostages alike.<br />Patchett took her inspiration from the real hostage taking at the Japanese Embassy in Peru six years ago which also lasted about four months.  I like her interpretation that human beings will try to make a sense of home wherever they are if they are there long enough and I wish I could find out more about what the experience was for the real hostages.<br />Bel Canto is not great literature but it is a compelling read, I recommend it highly as a book club read.	2003-01-15

Kate Morrison's whole life is turned upside down when at the age of seven both her parents are killed in a tragic car accident. Her older brother Luke, 19, sacrifices his chance at teacher's college to raise Kate and her baby sister Bo, 2, as well as her other brother Matt, 17. <br />It's been instilled in them from an early age that education equals salvation and that it's the only way to escape the limited possibilities of living in Crow Lake. All hopes are pegged on Matt, the scholar in the family and Kate's hero, but fate intervenes and Matt ends up staying and becoming a farmer. It's Kate that eventually gets that University degree and the good job as a microbiologist and she's never gotten over the guilt of what she feels has been the tragedy of Matt's lost chance. <br />Kate has spent the rest of her life since that fateful year building a shell around herself not letting anything or anyone in that could hurt her that as a family reunion approaches she's frantically trying to re-evaluate what it means to be a part of her family and how to introduce her boyfriend into it. The reunion ends up rattling her to the core as she's forced to realize that the tragedy in her family may not be what has happened to Matt but what has happened to the relationship between the two of them. <br />This book was surprisingly suspenseful and the characters are so richly developed that you'll keep thinking about them long after you finish the last page.	2003-01-15

Aurora is found as a baby wrapped in a basket covered by a rubber sheet tied to an upturned chair which is floating on an ice slab in the Artic Ocean off the coast of Newfoundland.  It is only a few days after the Titanic disaster but nobody is looking for this baby and from the beginning everything about her seems unusual.  She has pale skin and almost white hair and she always feels cool.  She likes to wander by herself and she has a very unusual connection with animals which leads the locals to think that maybe she was left by faeries.  I think I liked this book because although it paints this very ethereal picture of Aurora as a baby and as a child she has a very human marriage and a complex relationship with her children that is portrayed in a believable way.  You do not always like Aurora's decisions and the book has its share of heartbreak but I guarantee you will feel you've encountered a genuine and unique story that will stay with you long after you've finished the book.	2003-01-14

It has the issues of small town disintegration with the closing of the mill.  Divorce and and the choices we make for our children and the horrors and consequences of high school bullying.  I liked Richard Russo's writing style but I had a hard time liking the main character Miles Roby who seemed like such a fearful and pitiful creature that it was difficult to sympathize with him.  I found myself reading on just for those pages involving Max Roby, Miles' father, who had me laughing out loud.  However, the last third of the book was fascinating as many of the book's characters reach a breaking point culminating in a tension filled climax.
