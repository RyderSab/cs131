That it is our perspective on a person or event or thing, the 'broken car', the 'enemy' at work, that often stops us from being happy.<br /><br />The second part of the book contains advice on anger, and how to cultivate patience. The central argument he puts forward is that anger is a destructive mind, which causes pain to ourselves and to others. And that in the grip of anger, people behave in the most unskillful and even dangerous ways.  In the West we feel anger is a good thing, active, 'getting things out in the open' as it were, instead of 'repressing.' what it most often does, however, is makes the whole situation worse, because we are letting our often deluded mind, clouded by anger and disappointment, call the shots.  Think of Basil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers-his constant anger drove people away, and only made his daily life more and more complicated! I kept thinking of the scene where he gets so angry at his car he says, \\"right, i'll show you,\\" and begins to beat it with a huge tree branch while he tells it all the things that he has always hated about it.<br /><br />We may not use the tree branch with our loved ones, but verbal lashing out can be even more damaging-we can easily get a new car, but a new friend, partner, child?<br /><br />As Geshe Kelsang Gyatso says, a patient mind is able to step back from the situation to see how best to deal with it without flying off the handle and causing one to do or say something they will definitely regret. Arguments with loved ones, for example, are supposed to restore harmony and peace, but how often do they really?  A whole chapter on reasons not to retaliate is super as well.<br /><br />This is a very basic book for people interested in learning more about Buddhism, but the ideas for managing anger and cultivating patience in order to keep control of even the most difficult situations is one which any reader can benefit from.tience in order to keep control of even the most difficult situations is one which any reader can benefit from.	2005-03-07

It was nice to see Joe and Eve but the story was about Jane, and teens are really not that interesting, especially not her burgeoning sexuality, and attraction for a con man she lambastes at every turn. Trevor the likeable but unpredictable villain is sure to be back, as the author quite proudly tells us to look forward to the next book in 2005. If it is anything like this one, give it a miss.<br /><br />There is no hero, no villain, and the whole nonsense with Eve mourning her dead daughter and never being able to forgive Joe for wanting to give her closure is too repetitive. These characters are like robots which lurch in response to stimuli. The whole engine running on the fuel of a serial killer killing women around the world who look like Jane is just too unbelievable and really not that interesting. The whole novel was strung together episodically like a soap opera. Really dull. The ending was delivered with the sequel in mind and thus cheats people reading for so many pages.  Get it out of the library if you must, but otherwise, save your money and time.	2004-09-27

I don't know about other 'romance' readers, but I hate novels which start out with the hero swiving his lewd mistress. Even worse, he goes on to complain he hasn't had a wench for a whole week, and says to the heroine on their wedding night,\\"If I had had known virgins were like this I would have had one long ago.\\" Talk about crass. He is like a barbarian. Rose is feisty and the only thing that redeems the book. Veronica the mistress is a pain, and Dominic too stupid in his dealings with her. But because he does not care about anyone'ss feelings but his own, he ignores the strife even though he wounds Rose badly in the process. The whole kidnap and rose trapped in her uncles castle was slapstick and silly. The endless background wittering about bad old King John  and the Magna Carta was way too dull. When they couple finaly say they are in love with each other, well,  most of us could not have cared less.  Apart from some varied positions and word you would  not use in front of your granny, this book was not in the least sexy. Where is the sensual detail, the smell, taste, feel of falling in love, not just putting up with each other because of proximity?	2004-09-16

Readers are not stupid; Scarpetta has lacked verve for a long time. This book looks as though it literally went from her computer to the press without so much as a grammar and spell check. Her verb tenses are all over the place, and seldom used correctly. Where is the scintillating prose?<br /><br />One of the things I liked about Kay was the first person narrative style so we could follow her thoughts, be intimate with her even as she is foreign to us in many ways because of her job and grim experiences. Instead she has opted for a third person omniscient narrator a la Dickens, and refers to her own characters by their last names.  The killer and his motive are so ridiculous, even worse than her werewolf books in this series, that there is no real suspense or tension. We could not care less. Once again, Lucy's lesbianism, or not, takes center stage when she lets her hormones rule her head and takes on the deceitful Henri (etta).  Even worse, it causes problems with her partner the sex Rudy, obviously in love with her and jealous.<br /><br />Lucy is an out of control shrew with a gun and homicidal tendencies, with none of the redeeming features we have ever seen in past books, o which there were few.  Even worse, Kay and Benton were planning a romantic vacation for two weeks and once again selfish Lucy blows that to hell. Kay and Benton are like two strangers waiting for a bus, no heat at all. Where is the resolution of her thinking him dead and them being separated for so long?<br /><br />And who is the bizarre new guy in Kay's old job-not to mention the set up for her working there which they bleat on about for the first 50 pages, and then t vanishes without a trace?  The worst thing, however, easily has to be Pete Marino's sex life taking a totally unbelievable and lurid turn for the worst which no one in their right mind would find interesting or credible. It is all shock tactics to try to keep people reading, but who could care less?. The end of the book is so rushed and unresolved we know she is leaving us with a tag for a sequel, but quite frankly the world she portrays and the people in it are so unattractive, I am giving up. I have been a fan for years but this did not have a trace of the wonderfully vivid characters we used to care about.

The writing is like that of a two year old, the character's motivations as well. Nothing rings true, not even the anger or desire for revenge.  It devalues the experience of every single woman who has ever been raped, and also every woman who has lost a child to a hit and run driver. This isn't entertainment on any level, and there is certainly nothing morally uplifting about this overwrought tripe.<br /><br />The woman in question who is raped is not only raped, she is raped and sodomized in front of her husband who is handciapped and can't help her. Talk about laying on the sensationalism with a trowel.<br /><br />I am appalled that this book was published, even more shocked to see that it is part of a series-apparently a seven book series. This book was brief enough, printed in large print, I doubt it was even 50,00 words, but however many it was, it was way too many for me. It was predictable, overwrought, and just shows that publishers will do anything for sensationalism, and for new 'product', a book with a prominent writers name on it. And this author has the gall to think she has invented a new genre, 'the man in peril'.I think everyone offended by this book should complain to the publisher, and perhaps the rest of these extremely offensive series will be confined to the trash heap.<br /><br />Spoiler:<br /><br />How they can surgically castrate the three men, leave their testicles in plastic bags, and then find it FUNNY  when the men turn up at a doctor's office (not the hospital?) to ask to have them put back, is just too sick for words. And the doctor's secretary selling the story to the tabloids for $50000 is even more sick. Avoid this loser of a series if you have any taste or sense.	2004-08-24

He also becomes so much more dull as a hero compared to the villains of the piece, and the whole Brotherhood of the Sword, presumably to help each other, seems to be pointless in a lot of respects when we find out that the villains are amongst them and are killing each other off.<br /><br />All of the hero's duties mentioned so that he has no time for a wife, are what, exactly? He never leaves the castle!<br /><br />The whole issue of his brother and his sexual preferences is done to death, and never once is the fact that he is a murderer addressed! He just says, that's okay, you are my brother and I love you. Sodomy was totally sinful in those days, though since there is never once any mention of these people having any religion, it too is lost as a conflict point upon which the action could hinge, or be escalated, meaningful.<br /><br />The whole issue of her falling in love with a warrior is over almost before it's begun, again because there is no context. These people break all ten commandments with gleeful abandon, which is kind of odd for Crusaders, supposed Christians, to want to do.<br /><br />The book is weighed down with secondary characters or mentions of them for so short a novel, but when we really need them they are not there!! The Heir to Jerusalem vanishes from the book completely with little logic, and then we are supposed to find out what happens to him in the next book in the series, (first chapter included at the back of the book) when he has made hardly any impression. This is just plain bad writing and planning.  The couple's  love-making in the jail whilst being spied on by the voyueristic Damien is just gross.<br /><br />This book has no medieval content-they are all 'electrified,' 'mesmerized,' and they talk like teens down at the mall. There are no sumptuous or relevant details of medieval life, and there is a decidely digusting hidden patriotic message that seemingly tries to justify our current war which I find repellent.<br /><br />If you are going to write medievals with a message, keep to facts and truth, not melodrama, and certainly not this propaganda with offensively modern outlooks which devalue both time periods. I certainly am not going to waste my time on this sensationalist bodice ripper of a series. The blurb at the back of the book certainly is misleading. Very disappointing.hardly any impression.

He is self-righteous, cares for no one but himself, and his supposed love for his one year old daughter is so extensive he dumps her with a woman he terms a whore in Scotland, determined to never see his wife  Charlotte again.<br /><br />The plot 'twist' hinging on his having ruined her in a garden is one thing-the twin brother supposedly having done the deed is another absurd convention for thies genre of novel.  He is nasty, unforgiving, and incapable of love. The panoply of secondary charcacters and love affairs pad out an overly long book.<br /><br />Sophie York lusting after Alex (gross) and getting his twin Patrick in the next book you can see coming a mile off, though that next book is even worse, since Patrick is even more cruel to Sophie than Alex is to Charlotte, if such a thing is possible.<br /><br />Regencies do not all have to be light and fluffy but I expect characters of consistency and some integrity. Every misunderstanding in the book would have been cleared up had the couple ever spoken to one another, instead of indulging in their sexual obsessions.<br /><br />The love scenes were terribly wooden and not at all romantic with her weeping all over the place, him nasty and accusatory, saying the most unforgiveable things which the ninny then forgives!<br /><br />I am tired of near rape 'love scenes' in historical romance. What message are we giving to younger women-that love 'excuses' this kind of behavior?  Rubbish, I have read several of her other books, all with the same problems, in terms of the writing, and in terms of the characters' situations.  Add to that the terrible editing and numerous historical errors, andI have given up on this author completely.	2004-08-10

Her second novel didn't have enough sex, ditto this book. Also, like the second book, the premise of the couple already being in love means there is no heat, no tension.<br /><br />The best thing about Behind Closed Doors was the sexual tension, with the couple literally not knowing who they could trust on any level. In both of her last two books, the couples have practically grown up with each other, so there is little mystery. And who on earth marries the guy next door all that often? It is just too safe. Mildly edgy public sex on a motorcycle and at a waterfall does not make for a hot book.<br /><br />I liked Simon more than I liked her. McKenna can write men..<br /><br />Alas, they are usually Neanderthals, toying on the edge of S/m games dominance, and totally challenged by any thinking woman with a bit of independence who desires the more sensual in life. Simon's moods swung so rapidly and unaccountably that Ellen ended up sounding like she had a perpetually bad case of PMS trying to keep up with his snippiness.<br /><br />As for the mystery to be solved, well, the author gives away so much at the start of the book there is no suspense-we know exactly how it is all going to play out. The secondary plot with Ellen's fiancee and the town laundry woman is just too unbelievable to be true, and pads out an already well padded book the author no doubt struggled to sustain for about 100 k words. The author should stick to her guns and write sexy stories if that is what she likes to do. This was dismally dull.watered down pulp.	2004-08-09

Alas, it is hardly developed at all in the book until the last 40 pages or so, and I really can't see, hard as the author tried, how it is linked up with the supposed hero and heroine of this book, Ben Raven and the daughter of a murdered supreme court justice. The motive for the murders as the body pile mounts up is absolutely absurd, and the twist at the end totally falls flat. I felt really cheated by this book. It was nice to see Sherlock and Dillon and their little boy, but the whole relationship between Ben and his lady love is a wet squib and the macho posturing in the living room of Savich's home is just absurd. A real let down. Neither romantic, nor suspenseful.	2004-08-09

I really don't think the author writes about men or boys all that well, so considering the main protagonists are all supposed to be male this is a real let down. Also, at the end, when we get the usual rather dull round up of what happens to everyone, there is hardly any mention of Abby.  I like Kev Parker as a hero but a lot more could have been made of him.  Any other quiibbles I had with his character are in the nature of spoilers, so I can't be more specific here except to say that all the women are even more flat as characters than he is.  Abby had the potential to be really memorable, and that is lost in the farfetched conclusion.	2004-08-06

I think it might have been better as a dark book. Relying on the obnoxious dog with an eating disorder and the runs in order to get them out of various disasters is just too cutesy and ridiculous for words. The villain is motiveless, so none of the very rushed ending of the book really ties together.<br /><br /> Sam McCabe is great, but his sidekicks Wynne and &quot;Rambo Barbie&quot; Garnder and her &quot;J. Lo&quot; posterior are just very irritiating. The book is so repetitive that this is probably why. She uses whole sentences almost verbatim for the couple of love scenes in the book. The instant love affair is also wildly improbable but this is all par for the course in this genre. They never have a real conversation once they get past the 'so what is your family like' stage. Also, does every Rom sus novel have to be set in New Orleans these days? It must be putting off tourism to the city like nonbody's business!<br /><br /> Finally, the heroine, Maddie. She swings wildly from quivering little girl afraid of the dark to another Rambo Barbie sex goddess without any consistency.<br /><br /> An enjoyable read, but don't look for any heat or depth, just a mildly interesting way to pass the time.	2004-08-06

Simple sentence structures, one dimensional characters, and no heady erotic sexual scenes at all. They spend far more time talking about it, reading and writing emails about it, than they ever do doing it. The couple of scenes with the hero and heroine read like extremely tame, plain vanilla versions of the absolute worst of the Red Sage and Black Lace books, with a hero who does nothing but grunt and growl. Really, Susan Krinard's Werewolves are far more sexy, and have better manners!<br /><br />The whole bondage, domination/submission thing reads more like a text book, and the only lurid details in the book that moved me were the gross descriptions of the killer carving out their hearts. Ugh.<br /><br />This is a really BAD romance worse than any Harlequin I have ever read, with flat characters and a couple of pistoning scenes. I will not use the word love to describe them. The ending is trite, cliche, and so dull, as the writer spends PAGES telling us what happened to every single one of the minor characters, all living happily ever after of course, that I just sat their laughing, it was so bad.<br /><br />Really, if you want a spicy read, try Shannon McKenna, Susan Johnson, Thea Devine, or any of the Black Lace books if you really want to get daring-do not waste your time with an author who obviously writes a lot, but needs to learn how to tell a HOT story-four letter words, leather and handcuffs are trite and passe.	2004-08-02

They are clearly related to him, though he treats the girls, and especially the eternally barfing baby, as some rare species of insect. He has as much personality as one of his fine neck cloths. I can't imagine him being a rake-he is so full of himself, leers at every pair of breasts in sight, and is so meticulously dressed all the time that one would doubt he would ever do anything so undiginfied as sweat, let alone copulate. Also, vis a vis the errors in the book, I am sure he does not go around showing his 'labels' all over the place-I am sure the author meant lapels.<br /><br />As for the heroine, well, what can I say-the crippled heroine left on the shelf and rescued by the rake has been done to death, and done far better elsewhere.<br /><br />The endless tantrums, dullness of the settings-a room with tall windows, a study, well gee, where is the sumptuous language we expect from a well-written book, are all too dull for words. The endless stream of vomit is also unbearbale, not at all funny.<br /><br />In fact, I really wonder what people find so amusing or even romantic about adultery  and the social mores that allow men to treat women as little better than chattel. Where marriages of convenience are usually only convenient for the men, who do whatever they like and treat women like doormats.  Austen was highly witty and amusing, but she dealt with the real world and issues too. This is just foolishness, selfishness and hypocrisy. The heroine traps him into marriage to get hold of his sisters as children. He insists he wants to bed her and give her a bottle of an abortifacient just in case because he doesn't want kids and just in case the 'sheath fails'. Revolting.<br /><br />As if all of this is not repellent enough, what on earth was the author thinking having three couple in the book if we include Rees the composer and his estranged wife. Esme's story is more interesting, but I was really disgusted with the way Simon actually sexually responds to her when her pregnant belly comes into contact with his body. and she is an adulteress, not matter how oyu tryo to dress it up as romance.<br /><br />I also was appalled at the way that her hero lusts after all the other women quite openly-there is little focus on Henrietta apart from her pretty hair and nice smile.

All of these peoole are so selfish and care so little about Regency society with its strict dictates (yes it does seem a lot more Georgian than Regency in many respects, 18th century, as one reviewer said) that nothing is at stake for anyh of the coulles-they thrive on scandal rather than avoid it.  she set up the next books in her series, but failed miserably to write a single book in the series which we could classify as romance.<br /><br />A romance is a hero and heroine falling in love.

I will give you all the same reply I gave her as to why it is such a mediocre book.<br /><br /> The manuscipt is littered with errors right from the first page. There is no excuse for this with a spell and grammar checkers on most computers these days.<br /><br /> The first chapter is nothing more than pages and pages of exposition and background information dressed up as dialogue, with no sign of the main characters expect as people to be gossiped about in the vaguest way. Hero-male of species, Heroine-scandalous woman-but then they ALL are in this book so why do they care? They don't. They flout convention, so there is nothing at stake.<br /><br /> When the hero and heroine meet, there is no heat, just a rather crude leering on the hero's part. Then he decides to seduce secondary character Helene to play it safe, because she is married. Complete hypocrisy is not a very worthy character trait in a hero.<br /><br /> We get reams of tedious info about Helene's failed marriage, husband, husband's mistress, her music, her husband's career. In fact, we get the entire past sexual histories of all of the characters within the first 30 pages or so. Not subtle at all. There is way too much internalization, especially for people who are not the main characters. The internal monologue is not delineated with italics, so we get long paragraphs that look hashed together.<br /><br /> Even worse, Stephen suddenly wakes up at the age of 43 and decides to be married, wonders where the last ten years have gone, and decides he needs sex? Ludicrous. The author can't write about men at all.<br /><br /> Why have such a panoply of characters and affairs? THREE! It only waters down the romance between h and h. We want heat and passion, not a costume drama which is about as memorable as one of Rees' White Elephant Operas. This is also an absurd way of the author setting herself up for the next book with Rees and Helene-we need to care about the characters enough to see them through, and while they are trying very hard to be witty and charming, I see nothing of interest in any of them.<br /><br /> Helene deciding an affair is a great idea after years of chastity is also absurd. Once again, these characters have nothing at stake, they just do as they will. They are financially independent, can do as they like. This was not the norm for the period at all and destroys any tension she might have created. Where is the heroine! Lady Bea is a mere cipher.<br /><br /> Stephen is one note-Reform. The Tories were not interested in reform, so if he is Castlereagh's trusted man this is ridiculous. The little research that has been done is literally on the pages-an historical novelist should never show her corsets! One should introduce the historical detail as seamlessly as possible. Everything lurches, with jarringly discordant and jerky notes like Helene's waltz. I won't even go into the whole age of the waltz debate which readers love to argue about, except to say that it is not some newfangled thing as they all make it out to be. Stephen as someone with little social life and experience of dancing is absurd for this time, period, especially given his single state and title.<br /><br /> There is little setting woven into the book at all. I get the dressing room and the Rose Salon, the goat pasture, but no specifics, furniture, size of room, curtains upholstery, even a fireplace would be nice. Their dialogue is jarringly modern in places.<br /><br /> I hardly even get any details about what any of them are wearing, usually a bit interesting. The setting is NOT integrated into the book in any meaningful way. The action, such as it is, could literally be taking place anywhere.<br /><br /> This pseudo-comedy of manners could take place at any time because the characters don't give a fig about mores and they have no basis in society, they just live in their own little world apart from Stephen and his misplaced Radical sensibilities if he is a Tory.<br /><br /> The romance part of it: well, what can I say. When they finally do 'it' there is so much mention of the goat I thought I was going to get a bestial menage a trois. There was no heat or heart to the encounters between them, and there was no sequel to the scenes-they have sex, and then we get another domestic drama chapter. He creeps into the room, douses her with water, and it just drones on to a very unexciting chapter end, with no follow up there either. I would have liked to see warmth, commitment, their affair advancing, their plans for the future. Them actually speaking to each other about something other than sex. They are like wind up toys jerking to their conclusion.<br /><br /> Instead of a real conversation, we get Bea proposing via Romeo and Juliet and the second 'heroine' via the Song of Solomon. Very unoriginal, it has all been done before, far better elsewhere, and the characters have so little to say for themselves they can't even use their own words to woo each other? Or the supposedly brazen hussy is suddenly coyly shy? We expect growth and development from really good characters, and consistency as well. They are consistently dull but not much else.<br /><br /> The two epilogues are ridiculous as well. These people are not firmly fixed in their society or they would never so blithely court scandal. None of them ever learn their lessons, they are just wilful, capricious and obey the dictates of their loins. I dread to think what will happen to Stephen and Bea when he starts to go impotent.<br /><br /> At best this is a mildly diverting book one can waste a few hours at the beach with, but in terms of capturing the Regency period, it is average to poor, and in terms of romance, it is poor.<br /><br /> The first thing you can teach ever author who comes to you for editing advice is, &quot;A romance is the hero and heroine falling in love, and working toward a happily ever after ending.&quot; I wish writers would remember that.tle world apart from Stephen and his misplaced Radical sensibilities if he is a Tory. <br />  <br /> The romance part of it: well, what can I say.

Also, Ramses having meaningless sex with a new stranger while everyone else in peril, including his beloved Nefret, is the height of bad taste and not true to the character at all. Daria has  no redeeming features and the psychobabble to explain Nefret's supposed frigidity is just too terrible for words.<br />Really, I want to see them solve mysteries, have adventures, not their romantic troubles. And making Sethos the master criminal toothless is just to silly for words, and also foreshadows the friendships between the characters which chronologically comes way later in the series.<br />If she is going to go back in time, why  not to the good old early days with Ramses as a baby/child!! Instead of making them all seem so puerile when they are in their 20s.	2004-05-25

I hated the heroine, the near love making scenes just got to be too much after a while. By the time thy did the deed I cold not have cared less about either of them. With the way the heroine behaved, it was a wonder no one put her in the madhouse before that, she was such a shrew. A badly written failure.	2004-05-18

He has also tricked her into intimacy for years as a child by posing as her beloved pet wolf. Really pervy.<br />We are told that Carpathian cannot live without their lifemate and will go over to evil if they do not have her. He is so close to the edge he might as well be over it. He has waited twenty three years for her after all-though after a thousand of not turning bad we find this hard to believe.<br />Despite Savannah's continuous protests, he takes her as his lover and partner. But there is no tender lovemaking-he nearly rips her to pieces in every sense of the word in an appalling scene which goes on for over 50 pages!<br />I do get the blood, really, but the gratuitous violence and rape in this book is simply not what I expect from a romance.<br />Nor does his terrible behavior get mitigated in anyway when he uses his saliva with all of its Carpathian healing properties to 'heal' her and of course make the moves on her at the same time.  Really graphic, take my word for it.<br />There is just too much nonconsensual sexual activity in this book for any sensible modern woman reader to be comfortable with. I gave up after 100 pages, the book was so crude, violent and graphic in its portrayal of his betrayals and rape of the heroine. I will not even go into the terrible repetitive writing, with the use of hunger, need and erotic used about 4 times on every page. The shocking violence should be enough to deter any ture seeker of a romance read.	2004-05-18

As do the villains. Then the emphasis swings to them and we lose the sizzle and spark we had hoped for. It could have been a much better and more sexy book. The ending was also quite predicatable, and I am not impressed with Seger's sudden change of heart after all his brooding. Still a fast and fun read if you don't mind the obvious, creaking plot and a hero who has nothing to recommend him except being a rake.	2004-05-03

James is wooden, a duke who does what all day? They are supposed to be betrothed for two months, yet the supposed sizzle is contained for that long? And they hardly know each other, we never get to see his family?<br />The whole blackmail thing is predictable and trite.<br />James' cruelty is inexusable, as is his lack of explanaion to his wife.<br />The whole latter half of the book is a tragedy of errors and i ca't honestly say I know enough about these characters at the end to be interested in them enough to figure out why they fell in love.  Or care.<br />Her second book is a lot better, sexy and witty. This one was passable, a tried and tested formula that in this case has the emotional intensity of a log.	2004-05-03

You meet the man of your dreams on a plane, and he turns out to be your new boss when you are back at work on Monday morning.<br />Only instead of telling a pack of lies to impress, she blurts out the whole truth about everything and every one in her life.<br />There are the white lies we tell, and things we don't say at all, to avoid hurting the people we care about, and then there are huge whoppers. Emma falls into the first category. Jack is so secretive she can't get him to talk at all.<br />When he finally does, he tells all about her, because he loves her. But with the most shcoing results.<br />The dramatic tension and romantic tension in the book is far better than any of her Shopaholic books. And I find Emma much more charming. the cast of characters who all get their comeuppance in one way or the other are priceless. One thing is for sure, you will never look at lawyers or little white lies the same way again, let alone thong underwear!<br />I loved Jack-he actually had personality compare with Luke in her other books.

Romantica is romantic erotica, and it is one couple with lots of heated erotic situations.<br />I totally agree that the characters are inconsistent. I also think the villains were too. The whole romantic suspense genre seems to be predicated on the most unlikely people with nothing in common falling into bed together. Or in this case the wall, shower and so on.<br />It also includes several detailed scenes of the villain having sex which were very offputting, as was his voyeurism with the various camersa dotted around his house, and the explicit nature of said activities in various multiples and gender combinations.<br />Kensington should make it clear that the Brava line is going to contain material like this. A reader who forked out good money expect Nora Roberts would well be peeved, not to mention goggled-eyed or even offended.<br />Having said that, the one thing the book does having going for it is an interesting if totally Neanderthal hero, though I can' tbelieve he had not had a girl for five years since his brother was killed, he is so rampant. The drought becomes a flood, and Raine is swept away, but I would have liked to see her exercise a bit ore common sense and spine. The games they play are not always healthy or safe, and Seth not trusting her toward the end is pretty unforgiveable even if their sex life is stupendous.<br />The book is way too long, with lashings of detail on every movement of his body (where are HER feelings in all of this)  and even the hero says himself they are like a pair of minks. Subtlty, nuance, romance, even foreplay, vanish in a haze of power pwoer games on Seth's part. This novel could have been cut to half its length and toned down and not suffered, and still got commitment and the happily ever after.<br />Readers who like Susan Johnson, Robin Schone and Thea Devine will enjoy these books, but anyone else should exercise caution.these books, but anyone else should exercise caution.	2004-04-26

At the center of the story are also love stories, loves which are thwarted, perverted, destroyed by the Kingscourt men.  Unfortunately, they all therefore lack depth in a novel of this scope. The famine aspect is covered in blistering detail, then forgotten.<br />Kingscourt's character is by far the most compelling yet we learn little about him apart from the surface material until very near the end, buy which time it is nearly too late. Mary is a cipher for the most part, as is Laura, his wife. Pius Mulvey becomes increasingly monstrous as the book goes on, to the point of him not even being human any more.  His willingness to do anything to survive which is commented upon by the author in the context of Kingscourt and the doctor Mangan's conversation in the latter half of the book does not excuse what he's done. He blights the woman he claims to love's whole life and still expects her to come back to him.  The book becomes so Dickensian it loses its humanity and appeal.<br />Still, for its descriptions of Connemara, and the Famine, almost all accurae and very well researched, it is well worth reading. (even if it has been done better elsewhere)	2004-04-26

We get more detail of her birth control practices than we do of her passionate interest for the hero. Ugh.<br />Our hero may be known as the Archangel and fabulously handsome and eligible, but he is thoroughly unlikable in my opinion. He is rude, patronizing, and above all, in love with another woman (another man's wife) in the book throughout nearly the whole of it, whilst still deciding to put himself on the Marriage Mart with the help of his female secretary, who he is trying to make into his mistress. Ugh again. He also has a ex-mistress he spends more time with than the heroine, and is so patronizing towards her it is a wonder she doesn't kill him with her bare hands!<br />I don't see anything passionate or sensual in this book at all.  The ONLY love scene in the whole book happens on page 71. Any of the usual conventional ways of getting them romantically linked again are totally forfeited.  The unchaperoned trip into the countryside, old deserted inn, all of them in peril...Sound familiar? But it is all to try to discover who has tried to murder him. They never even so much as kiss!! Or hold hands or touch!<br />The book drags on way too long. The title is based on the costume she wears in the last 10 pages of the book, when he finally sees how she really is through her startling family resemblance to all the males in her family. Silly, really.<br />The fact that the heroine is supposed to have been in so much danger all these years that she walks around in dark glasses to hide her eyes, which only call attention to her appearance, and a terrible wig which also calls attention to her, is all the more absurd. Anyone else would have just sent her to America or India if it were that risky for her to be found.<br />All of this absurdity might have been overlooked if there had been some heat between the couple, but anything there was in the wooden, totally in the dark love scene  which lasts a page or two without any sensuality, dies totally after page 72.<br />The so-called mystery is preditable, and not worth the time or effort to plow through the book.o America or India if it were that risky for her to be found. <br />All of this absurdity might have been overlooked if there had been some heat between the couple, but anything there was in the wooden, totally in the dark love scene  which lasts a page or two without any sensuality, dies totally after page 72.  <br />The so-called mystery is preditable, and not worth the time or effort to plow through the book.	2004-04-20

Nearly all of her supposed love scenes are nonconsensual. Please, can get get away from the bodice rippers of the 70s already.  Intelligent modern readers want so much more. The deflowering of women is just not an entertaining topic, and especially not when done with such graphic and down right crass mishandling.<br />William finds out she is not a virgin and immediately blames her without ever once stoping to look around him at the ruined mansion he has got thanks to marrying a total stranger. she is just a possession to him like everything else.  He just can't bear the thought of anyone sharing fun with her except him. He doesn't understand that every time he calls her CAt and falls upon her like a starving man on his dinner, that this is what her attacker used to do to her. He hardly even bothers to try to understand her point of view until it is forcibly shoved under his nose.<br />William is not quite as Neanderthal as her other heroes but he comes pretty close. Then we have her rapist Lambert going about scot free and trying to reclaim her. He tries to kill her, and at last she fights back for about a minute. Graphic violence ensues, and that includes William being stabbed in both sides with swords and still surviving to kill the villain. PUH-LEEESE.<br /> We never see any commitment warmth or fondness in any of these books, just unremitting doom and gloom, and miserable lives for all her female characters. This is not quite as depressing as some of Ms. Dain's other books, but the characters are flat and insipid and not people I ever care about even though we are supposed to admire her as a victim. and him for 'forgivng' her.<br />I would rather admire my characters for being brave, noble, loving and committed to one another. As most intelligent readers of romance would. Let this one go for sure.	2004-04-05

There is no spark in either of the two couples, and one good conversation between Aline and McKenna would have put an end to all the suffering and pain.<br />Also, there is no falling in love inthe novel except between the two lesser characters Livia and Gideon. Aline and McKenna are already in love and hot and heavy at the start of the book, then 12 years lapse.  he wants revenge, doens't get it, and we get nothing but cookie-cutter love scene which vary only in terms of venue and position.<br />With Livia and Gideon they go to bed with each other too quickly. Having two couples in the book waters it down way too much for my liking. And I have to say Gideon was far more interesting than McKenna.<br />Can someone please tell these authors that a romance  novel is two people falling in love?<br />One other small point-there were so many typos in this book, missing words, wrong words obviously inserted by a spellchecker, that it really got very irritating.

Wading through crudity and uninteresting characters just because they are supposed to be the descendants of King Arthur is NOT entertaining.<br />The violence and rape is gratuitous and the 'deflowering' of each girl is formulaic and about as romantic as discussing the laundry. Which they do at length.<br />The introduction is a rehash of Arthur pulling the sword from the stone to become king. Then we get his decendants hundreds of years later? Who cares-there is nothing mythological or magical about any of them.  The three novellas have as much depth to them or their characters as a puddle. Killing off the little sister Mary so the hero can be 'someone' in the first novella is absurd and crass and covered in about a paragraph.  It all goes downhill from there. Give us romances where we see the couple really falling in love. You can possible cover a year of marriage in less than 80 pages and leave the reader satisfied on even the most basic level.	2004-03-11

It is not Medieval, but the Dark ages, and very dark they are too in this book. The two of them snarl like a couple of wolves in heat. There is no sense of genuine commitment or love and the sex is pretty uninteresting. The book is littered with semi-colons I found myself counting them per page, 4 on average at the start of the book.<br />Her heroic struggle: to commit suicide by starving herself or working herself to death? She just ends up seeming like a selfish, short-sighted twit.<br />His heroic struggle? None so far as I can see.  Abusing one Roman woman to get even for being made a galley slave is just too trite for words. Not to mention vindictive and foolish.<br />This author really needs to have her very bad habits squashed out of her. The worst offence being that she is still writing bodice ripper style books which could have been done in the 70s or 80s, certainly I can't think why they are getting published in the 2000s.  There is little of interest here for the modern, clued-in sensual young woman reader.  Non-consensual sex scenes offend me.	2004-03-02

The heroine is totally uninteresting, and the hero is a humorless prig of the first order. He sits around worrying about his lust all the time and fails to care about any other person but himself.  When he finally decides he is going to consummate his marriage, with all of the enthusiasm of a man about to be executed, he really picks his moment. And has sex with her after she has just been nearly raped in a stinking dungeon and has just seen her assailant's head hacked off and rolling into the distance. That is truly just gross<br />Later, her stripping naked for bandages for one injured man is just silly-most normal women would just lift their skirts and cut off several yards of fabric, not strip naked in front of total strangers in the wilderness and then not even bother to put their dress back on<br />The story is way too short and 'one note'-his guilt over his supposed lust, and her love and then her anger<br />There is no real convincing falling in love with the story because she is already in love with him, has been since her childhood, and he is in lust with her.<br />Never once anywhere in the book do they say they love each other. Or even have a relatively normal conversation.<br />The sexual aspect of this novel is far too violent and her repetitiveness in the saying she will have to tolerate him for three years until she gets pregnant is just too silly for words. Her 'she loves him, she loves him not' attitude gets wearing after the first 50 pages.<br />The author also needs to be cured of her semi-colonitis. They are put all over the place and rarely used correctly and it only serves to distract from an already hard to follow and rather dull narrative.	2004-03-02

It is the sort you hear on really bad sci fi programs like the old Star Trek, where everything is explained in a really long winded fashion to give you the background information on who these character are and what their situation, likes and dislikes. Endless comments about wine, his clothes, prime rib being Matt's favorite meal, and the hole in the big toe of his sneaker are just not romance worthy and bog down an already dull book.<br />His whole dumping her at the altar and second chance and engagement to Lily in the wilderness survival course, should have been shown, not told in a paragraph or two.  Let alone dumping her at the altar again.  Tedious.<br />This author breaks every rule of good story telling and is really starting to show her sell by date. I am heartily sick of pseudo paranormal stuff in supposedly mainstream contemporary fiction. Is this really the only way they can solve the messes they put their characters in?<br />And not especially interesting characters at that? Where is heat, sensuality?<br />I am also sick of books where the characters are rarely ever in the same room with each other, and only ever fighting most of the time even when they are.<br />Also, if they are already in love then where is the romance? This novel fails on every level a romance needs to function, and it is total fluff so can't be labelled women's fiction.  I would give it minus stars if I could, it is so mediocre.	2004-02-17

The start of the book gives a full bio of the heroine and rants on for two pages about how the Maericans can make coffee and not tea. She is also so down on men that she spends most of her time avoiding any amatory activity. The height of interest her her talking about it, getting a massage with some 'extras' which are plain vanilla, and walking in on her roommate, who is now 'in love' and pregnant.  The other main heroine is a virgin, so nothing going on here except some pubescent fantasies and wondering, which she has to wait to find out about until the end of the book, when it is dealt with in one sentence!<br />The dominatrix with hideous old men, and the herone's mother getting more nooky than anyone else is just silly. All the guys are so unattractive in what they do or say that I can't believe they published this book. Black Lace is usually much more edgy and innovative than this tired middle class, middle of the road psuedo romance.<br />This reads likea really bad Harlequin romance with less sizzle if we are talking about the Blaze or Desire lines.  I totally sympathise with the writer for the loss of her hubby, as she indicates in the dedication, but this is not even a romance, let alone erotica.	2004-02-12

Her clever disguise and resourcefulness, and Mikke's growing maturity make for a gripping read!!<br />On the Christian level it is sincere without being preachy.<br />On the historical level it is accurate and very interesting. The details of life in the Viking world are superb.  A wonderful read for kids and adults alike.	2004-02-10
US	49216591	R80MPK2W3VFSO	0671739743	598069709	The Velvet Promise	Books	1	17	20	N	N	wooden, contrived and way too violent	I object to any novel in which rape is seen as an acceptable way for a man to bring his wife into line. Ditto smashing her in the mouth, and sadomasochistic kinky sexual practices.  there is way too much hot andheav stuff between Gavin the supposed hero and Alice, his mistress who has married another because she is ambitious. her husband is a savage who resorts to the abovementioned practices, and all the other women in the castle are like something from a Drcula film as they all satisfy their unnatural desires.<br />Judith is too good to be true in some cases and a total fishwife in others, and Gavin has got to be the dumbest man alive  not to see through Alice. For 2 whole years, no less. The ending is melodrama at its worst, and the miscarriage Judith suffers because of her is just as glossed over as the appalling violence toward women in the rest of the book. Their constant jealousy and bickering makes the book a chore to read after the first 50 pages. I kept hoping it would get better but it didn't. And of course evil Alice is left alive for revenge at the end of the book. I wish she had sapred us a sequel but she didn't.	2004-02-10

The fact that the supposed hero gets sexually aroused as she tells him about her life in a child brothel in Istanbul is just revolting, and there is about as much heat and sensuality in this book as a guttering candle. This is the first book I ever read by this author, and It will most certainly be my last.<br />These are not characters, they are cardboard cut outs. Even the dolpins are only moderately interesting, and her foster father is too stupid and terrible to be true. A real let down for intelligent readers who want more than simple minded fluff written in words of more than one syllable.	2004-02-02

The couple kiss once, have sex immediately after, and then basically split up again when he finally makes clear that he is still married. He should have told her clearly long before he ever dragged her out into the wilderness to have his way with her.  Most of the time he never even speaks and is little better than a Neanderthal, so it is not really a surprise, but it sort of puts the reader off him apart from his love of birds. His inadequate love for his daughter is also a real turn off. And his sticking to his terrible mother and wife just silly.<br />Harris is a weak man in every sense of the word, someone who cannot say no to any woman in his life. His wife Fannie is a sterotype, and the daughter too.  Even Ella, the supposed heroine, is as wooden as a cigar store Indian. A complte sterotype of ood little girl, plin, middle aged, raised by maiden aunts and as sexy as white bread.  There is no passion and not even an angst because Harris makes it clear as soon as they have had sex  that he has no intention of divorcing his wife. Pity he didn't tell her before!!<br />He goes back to his wife, and in fact very nearly has sex with her until he gropes her so extensively that he finds she is up to her old tricks of stealing drugs from his clinic to feed her habit. And of course Fannie is such a monster that she threatens to take away the bird sanctuary by demanding one half of all he has when he finally does tell her it is over because she is so selfish that he is neglecting her own 6 yr old diabetic daughter.<br />The whole secondary plots with Brady and Lijah drag the book out even further into what is essentially a soulless read apart from what the author has meticulously researched about birds. She would have been better off writing non-fiction!<br />Then ending can be seen coming a mile off, and my only wonder is that Ella immediately agrees to marry him with his wife's dead body not three feet away and scarcely cold.  She would have been better off with a man with a heart.<br />This is a good author who really needs to learn how to write a balanced book with emotionally mature and deep characters, and real problems and situations that they actively solve, rather than have ten ton weights land on their head all the time. And characters who have sensuality, and don't merely take their clothes of and get on with it in a sentence or two.a mile off, and my only wonder is that Ella immediately agrees to marry him with his wife's dead body not three feet away and scarcely cold.

It was suspense, fun, witty, and cleverly put together.  The hero is played like a violin by everyone who surrounds him, and there are some brilliant inversions of good and evil which I can't go into too much without giving the whole book away. Suffice it to say he gets revenge and gets screwed at the same time.<br />He is a wonderful anti-hero, clever, but thinks he is more intellligent than he actually is. His wry outlook on life is hilarious at times.  This is the real deal, a writer with talent turning out original material, not the usual pulpy trash that passes for suspense these days. I found my hands and feet sweating with every single close escape.  You will devour this book and be left begging for more. I sure hope he has a sequel.	2004-01-27

I think the whole abuse them is so graphically and tastelessly done that it can hardly be considered entertaining, and any author who makes money from this sort of sensationalist rubbish should donate her time and money to rape and child abuse crisis centers.<br />In terms of the writing, it is terrible, completely disjointed. and supposedly trying to portray her disjointed memories. But since she is supposed to have amnesia what does she really remember. And every time she asks she gets all lies anyway. It starts looking more and more like the author does not even know what information to give us to tie the whole thing together, and there are some real inconsistencies and irrelevant information about people and places that make this whole thing read like a disorganized mess in need of a really good edit.<br />Even leaving aside the problems with the narrative structure, we don't care about the characters enough to weed it all out.  The heroine Casey is so wooden and nearly always unconscious because constantly fainting, so that she is hardly of any interest and her boyfriend the wonderful doctor is too sterotyped and too good to be true.<br />Just as the mother and step brother and fiance are all  too terrible to be true, and the motives of the villains are just unbelieveable. As is the fact that Casey forgives them all in the end and they live happily ever after!! Even the good doc can't believe when Casy forgives them at the end. This is absolute drivel of the worst sort,  not romance, not a thriller. Don't waste your time.	2004-01-26

After allowing herself to be tied up because she thinks her lover has come back for another round of kinky S and M sex, she is found dead.  We also know her lover is a person she works with.<br />Then we have Russ, supposedly determined to get the killer no mater what spending all his time either arguing wih or defending Jennifer, who he split up with 2 years before.<br />Then we get tons of pyschobabble, a rather pathetic witness who keeps jerking everyone around, and Jennifer's own stupidity in going after the man she thinks responsible.<br />After a few minutes of angst ridden conversation, she and Russ end up in the sack, then he leaves a note on her pillow saying how much he needs to get away. He never calls and of course she starts to conclude that Russ is his partnr's killer after all. So much for the happily ever after and trust she promised him in the sack.<br />The diary supposedly left by Sharon is a red herring, and the S and M boyfriend, who is one sick dude, is turned into a laughable fool by the end of the book, as is the killer. Pathetic too in terms of his motivations.<br />This book did not ring true as either a thriller or a romance. The author took too many short cuts to both, with no genuine falling in love aspect, and no real suspense. We know who the killer is--giving us 5 suspects just makes the author look like she thinks her readers are all fools. It is all just meaningless sex, smoke and mirrors and no depth. This is the first book I have read by this author-I think it will be my last.	2004-01-26

Add to that all the background on the Maya cannabilistic practices, and we lose sight of the characters, who are not really intriguing enough to sustain this book. A worthy first effort which could have used a great deal more editing.	2004-01-26

Alas, our heroine Becka comes off as a complete witch, who never has any faith in him and treats him like a stereotype.  The author pumps up the sexual tension, hen leaves him and everyone else dangling, just because she blows hot and cold and really cold.<br />The book starts out well and you can tell the author likes baseball a lot, but they deal with a lot of issues outside the couple, so much so that the couple's affair takes a back burner every single time to the latest crisis with the team.<br />I would love to have seen a real development of character from both people. The near end of the relationhip was terrible-sensationalist rubbish, and if I had been Mace I would have just kept on walking away from her, because Becka sure wasn't worth it.	2004-01-26

And I am not Af-Am.<br />Add to that the sex play between the two and her voyeurism as he has sex with the woman who supposedly murdered his friend, and we have a really revolting book.<br />Even worse is again the premise in Forever of evil people kidnapping children to use for their own sick purpose, with no thought as to how offensive this is. This author should definitely spend some time working for a Missing person's/children's hotline if she thinks to make money from this as something 'etnertaining.'<br />The end of the book is so rushed it does not tie up all the loose ends, only goes on to try to show how she can get the power to get Adam back-by becoming more evil herself. We never see Adam in the book at all, the supposedly happy marriage etc that we were left with at the end of the last  novel, so the whole thing is just pointless drivel with a heroine with and an almost anti-hero in the constantly horny Linc even trying to have sex with various ghosts (including 4 at one time!!) who have all of the characterization of cardboard cut outs.<br />This and forever were the first two books I tried by Deveraux;  I will never read one of this author's novels again.	2004-01-14

Not so this couple.  We first of all get six extremely long background chapters trying to fill us in on all of the implications of Harold vs William trying to become the King of England pre- and post-1066.<br />We also get helps of violence and the hero Aimery's divided loyalties because he had an English mother. All of what he suffers at the Battle of hastings comes out in only occasional spurts to make him seem a tortured hero. He is totally inconsistent otherwise.<br />As for the heroine, she is stcuk in a convent at the start of the book, and will eventually be freed from there by the deaths of her father and brother. These events are treated in such an offhand manner it is insulting to the reader's intelligence. But since she is not a very interesting character, we do not really care anyway.<br />She is given an English estate to run, but her aunt and uncle treat the people really badly, and so the Engllish hate her and scheme against her at every turn.<br />Aimery is disguised as a highwayman to try to help the English people, and to oversee the lands which have been given away by William. I can understand some divided loyalty, with his uncle Hereward being the true owner of the land, and William being his godfather and liege lord. Much is also made of how English versus Norman he is. Yet he never once has any doubts about his course of action? It is all glossed over and made to seem irrelevant, when he risks danger from all sides.<br />Madeleine does, however, have doubts about everything he does.  She is convinced he is a traitor right until the last few pages of the book. They never get to know each other well enough to trust in the other. He is sure that she has been cruel to her tenants and so he avoids her like the plague. He only cares that her uncle beats her with a LOG because he is afraid the English people will be punished if anyone finds out they have been complicit in the abuse she is suffering.<br /><br />The wedding night is crude, and indeed all the violence as she is spanked,  manipulated,  and nearly if not totally raped by the different men who want to control her is really offensive even if we do assume that things were a lot more rough than in they are now. Aimery's reiterated point that it is not rape because she is his wife is just revolting.<br />Her sleazy cousin trying to betray them at every turn, and a cast of odious traitors makes it very hard to like anyone in the book apart from Aimery's brother Leo, already married.  The next book in the series is supposed to be about his brother Roger, but  the couple of times he appears he is so offensive, why bother? Aimery is supposed to be the hero but he has abot as much depth of character and heroic qualities as a sponge.<br />Madleine tries very hard to be a heroine, but she has little personality and is only seen a a voluptuous woman wih a natural talent in bed.  Or the target of the men's brutal violence and lust.  When she finally tells her she loves him, it is laughable.<br />This book was only interesting in terms of the historical period of time and William and his wife Matilda. Everything else was just macho posturing, violence, and crudity.

If you like erotica this is the book for you. If you like sensuality, and  characters who speak to one another occasionally and show true love and esteem, try another author.	2003-12-09

The ladylike heroine and the rakish man has been done to death at this stage. There is no spark between the characters apart from the kiss, no sensuality, and dozens of characters mentioned never to be seen again. I find that the other couples in the book are all more interesting than the central one, which is not saying much since even Anne the heroine finds them dull. And crippled heroines have been done to death at this stage as well, as has the innocent and niave girl who asks a rake for tutelage in love.<br />I also saw so many grammatical errors in this book that the whole thing struck me as slipshod and yet another book churned out to try to continue a successful series at the expense of commonsense and quality.	2003-12-01

The love scenes are terrible, and we never get a sense of ture commitment from Nat, only Sophie's love for him which looks a whole lot like frustrated need. His gleeful visit to the brothel followed by his sudden remorse, and decision to find a nice safe widow with the help of his friends is offensive. As is his decision to go after Lady Gullis, and constant bewailing of the fact that if he had known she was on offer sooner he wold never have got mixed up with Sophie!!<br />To allow his friend Eden, who sets up all of his amours, and knows the best tarts in London, to marry his niece, is the worst thing Nat could ever do.  Why wed her to a debauched pimp, even if he does have a title and wealth?<br />And they have the nerve to look down on other people? The whole book wa short but could have been shorter still without the subplot of Eden and Lavinia getting married, not to mention his sister and her cousin and blah blah blah.  the whole family tricking her into seeing him is just too absurd, as is her blurtingout her news-totally predictable.<br />The four horsemen are rude, vulgar, ungentlemanly, and crass, and there is no romance in this book, only copulation. It was exceptionally dull with no emotional involvement-like there is a thick pane of glass between their feelings and their actions.  Readers deserve better that this mish mash which tries to titillate and only irritates.	2003-10-21

I noticed this because of the rather gross and callous detail, which was not really sensual at all, more reminscient of an electrician who gets the shock of his life if you take my meaning.<br />De Rohan also threatens to overshadow David at times, and he is so lividly jealous of Betham Rutledge that I am amazed he does not go wild over Max being with his beloved.<br />The mystery element was ok, but anyone could have guessed who it would be from the clues she gave.  The whole lurid melodramatic scene in the brothel was also a bit of a let down.<br />People who had  not read the previous books might have had some trouble figuring out who all these people were, and why we should care. Cole Amherst as cheating vicar is probably my least favorite character after having read A Woman Scorned and this book. He too threatens to overshadow David and the family secret is overplayed. Still I liked both characters. A good way to wile away the time, and better than all the other books in the series, thoguh Max's is pretty good too.(No True Gentleman)	2003-10-21

Freya is the least likable of all the Bedwyns, and the tired predictable ploting just make this book plod along. The secondary characters are far more interesting than the hero and heroine, and the fake engagement is taken straight out of A Summer to Remember which was how this whole turgid series got started.  Either the author is really running out of ideas, that she has to keep repeating herself  or copying others' series, or the state of the romance industry is so sad that only the same kinds of books over and over again sell. Or maybe they just cash in on the author's name and reputation and assume they can give any old schlock to readers and they will spend money on it. Whatever the reasons, I long for a good juicy romance with characters who really know and understand each other, and who can have a good happy romping love scene without constant undertones of violence and depravity. Where is the sensuality and love? It is all animal passion and not even respect or regard for the other person as a human being most of the time. Thank goodness this series is over.  I was dreading having to sit through the rest of the horrible Bedwyn brood.	2003-10-15

The part in the brothel is totally gratuitous and there is nothing romantic about this book because they never realy fall in love.<br />Bryght himself tells her several hundred pages into the book that they never talk. How true-they are hardly ever in the same room together, both tearing off in different directions, him trying to save her and her getting involved in worse and worse disasters.<br />Trying to seduce his enemy and her old childhood friend are among the dumbest and most offensive things she does even after he has told her he  loves her and that she should try to trust him. All the people who hate him and her are the ones she does trust.<br />She is supposed to be named after the woman in Merchant of Venice who is able to discern truth from lies, and dispense justice. She is totally feeble at both, and  as blind as a bat to herself and others. A frantic book with little humor and even less love.  I will take Bryght any day, but he deserves a lot better than Portia.  No one would ever want to identify with such a priggish fool.<br />The endless warnings against gambling and descriptions of the games of chance and canals, and her afterword, show that the author really let her research show for all to see, and got way to carried away in her message to make us care about any of the characters. A feeble volume in this increasingly lacklustre series. Where is the sizzle?	2003-10-14

He becomes nothing more than a man who boinks his way through life and is actually even made into a figure of fun with his transformations.<br />The second half of the book is dominated by Rome and Dryas, and thus really not that interesting. The love story with Lucius is a total anti-climax, and Caesar, Cleo and Antony are all like cardboard cutouts. The ending is abrupt and leaves us hanging. The whole bizarre story with Calpurnia is just too silly, but it is critical to the whole plot.  I like Maeniel much better when he was in love with Imona, and his relationship with Dryas is absurd.<br />It starts out as erotic, and by the end it becomes, gee, they had a great time. We also get tons of characters with various depravities, but little point in introducing them.<br />I wonder if the author became as bored with the book as I did at the end. I mean, we all know Caesar is about to be assassinated, but there would have been more suspense! The history of the period is not really brought to life, for all the gladiatorial nonsense which has been done far better elsewhere.<br />I adored the Silver Wolf,  but she was a much more sensual character, with real depth, and Maeniel likewise gets to do far more exciting things than hunt and sniff women.  Apart from being a good hunter and lover, Maeniel just dwindles to almost nothing at the end of this novel.<br />I hope he will improve in the Wolf King; he was certainly a lot more interesting in the Silver Wolf.	2003-10-13

It covers every food group, has a pantry section at the back so you can make your own salsas, dressings, dips and so on really easily and healthfully, and gives you all your RDAs too.<br />The how-to and shopping sections are also superb.

Trying to set up for a new title in the series is never a good idea, and you would reall have had to read other books in the series to understand a lot of what is going on, or even like any of the characters.  Her terror of his violence becomes all too real, and making excuses is not acceptable. I agree with the other reviewers that publishing houses and especially the predominantly female editors in these house should never make abuse or forced sexual ecounters the stuff for which they base their entertainment or their profits. And any author who thinks it is amusing for readers should donate her time and at least part of her profits to a women's shelter!	2003-10-01

He tells her he is no capable of love, and yet acts in ways which quite clearly shows he cares. Because she never brings herself to trust him she brings all sorts of suffering down on himself, and yet he blames himself for hurting her.<br />Our hero totally lacks depth because she is the center of attention, and is so busy trying to protect himself from bing betrayed again. If he had any spine at all he would have it out with the villain once and for all in front of her and then there wouldn't be these incessant misunderstandings. They are in love with each other within the firstthird of the book-the rest just drags to the melodramatic and absurd conclusion. all the other sex with other people information and material about Kitt and Clay to set up for the next novel in the series, I could really do without.An average read with sentences and dialog so wooden I am surprised I cold bend the pages of the book.	2003-09-30

He tries to provide a full socio-economic context for the events in the Peninsula, but goes around and around in circles over spain. Undoubtedly it is good to use the underutilised Spanish sources, which are indeed interesting, but the fact is that the war begins in Portugal, yet is is scaracely given more than a few pages of background. The maps are useful, but there is little meat in a lot of what he says. As a beginner's book, this would leave a lot of confusion. As a definitive work, there is little new apart from the Spanish sources.  Perhaps a more clear organization of the book, with appropriate chapter headings and a better index would help.  By the time he gets to the Pyrenees, he, like so many other narrators, has long since run out of steam, yet it is in some senses the crux or end of the story, even if it did not take place in Spain.  I wish authors dealing with this period  would get over the annoying habit of mentioning what will happen later, and then giving only partial information, for example Zaragossa.  Perhaps a detailed list of all the battles/main locations with key dates/events might, but as it is it makes everything seem very patchy and badly thought out.<br />Perhaps if he had confined himself to Spain in the Peninsular war he would have done a great deal better. Likewise, a volume on Portugal, and on the Pyrenees would make much more sense than what he has ended up with. Since he has used so many Spanish sources, some of the basic ones British ones are badly neglected.	2003-09-29

Unfortunately it fails to deliver, for a number of very obvious reasons.<br />The beginning is excellent, and the attraction between Cyn and Chastity is clearly depicted, except that he never lets on that he knows she is a woman. she comes off as a real withc at times.  All of the inevitable jokes and lustiness as a result of her disguise and his silence is a man directed to a boy, for all intents and purposes, and all of his jokes about boys' schools and sodomy get to be really unromantic after a while.<br />Then we have his attitude to her when he sleeps with her without admitting he knows who it is. He looks down his nose at her for being a tart without ever once asking her for the truth about what has been going on. Even his own brother, combing the orgy with various lewd women, is able to penetrate her disguise. But he judges her and is not very pleasant at all. Nowhere do I see any convincing falling in love, just sexual attraction.<br />The rivalry with his elder brother Rothgar over the past and Chastity really weighs down the book as well, and is unworthy of both men. Once Rothgar gets involved, he has such convoluted machinations going on that the vein of romance running throughout the book virtually disappears.  Especially when Cyn declares he will never make love to her again until they are married. Ruin the sizzle and suspense or what!<br />The end is totally melodramatic, and despite all of the references to the history of England and Bonny Prince Charlie the reader is given very little context for all the events going on around which the escape of the two sisters has hinged all along.  It is all a muddle of revelations and murder.<br />The girls' father comes off as little better than a stage villain, and it is hard to believe that Chastity is able to keep escaping so repeatedly, let alone being rescued by Cyn so often. The brother Fort swings back and forth like a pendulum between defending his family and abandoning them. The ending gets completely tedious.<br />Finally, the orgy.  For deliberate shock value it is fine, rather silly, but none of the characters end up even remotely sympathetic as a result of all they do there.<br />Too much of the plot relies upon coincidence for this to be a really successful novel, and I would have loved some real romantic scenes between the two without his dress and her man's suit getting in the way so often.  Chastity is buffeted by the winds of chance and fortune, and would be a goner without Cyn. Which makes her weak and pathetic, and a rather dull character. The shift in the novel from his point of view to mainly hers really ruins it.  Cyn deserves better for sure.<br />A silly romp in an undefined 18th century England, with some hope for more in the series from the interesting Rothgar, and Cyn with a wife who really deserves him, one can only hope.ween defending his family and abandoning them.

US	49216591	RR7C7ET1MWLNF	0440241049	880815333	Slightly Married	Books	1	14	22	N	Y	Totally wooden	I know Aidan is supposed to be a solider, but his campaign to woo his wife is absoltely the most unromantic thing I hae ever read. He is constantly telling her he is going to leave her, and even his decision to take her to bed in a tawdry inn is based on the fact that he is going to dump her but since they are supposed to be married for the rest of their lives he might as well show her what it is like to have a man in her bed.<br />Eve and her lame ducks are very sweet, but she has about as much personality as a vat of goose grease.  The interfering Bedwyns really do very little to help this along, and the only man of any real sexual interest is the cold and aloof Wulf.<br />I cannot imagine anyone describing this book as a romance when the love scenes are at best a coming together of two rathr frigid bodies. There is no inidcation he loves and respects her as the person she has become, and even the premise that her love thaws him is flawed-he never thaws at all throughout the whole book, not even at the end when he decides to hang around after all. This is a wealthy man who can do or have whatever he wants, and hs just settles for her to keep his promise to her dead brother.  I have given up on the Bedwyn series-they are all exceedingly dull and certainly do not live up to their titles at all.	2003-09-25

Then just when she I about to get her dream come true with Jake, his brother Steve arrives and she jumps right back onthe merr go round with him.  finally,only when she has practically killed herself doe Jake admit how he feels about her.<br />A lot of what jake does is not hands on, so to speak, but the toher two men are hot.<br />Lots of dramatic tension, but as an erotic novel, not really.<br />As the other people have said, she is stoned a lot of the time and maudlin and sentimental.  she lives in a shadow world of her own making and Jake is never allowed the chance to do or say anything to explain himself.<br />the erotic potential Greg represents in freeing her from her cocoon and letter her be a gorgeous butterfly could have been explored better as well.<br />No real summer fever, more like a sand trap.	2003-09-25

But the sex scenes are nearly carbon copies of one another, and they have so little personailty for the most part that it is not exciting when the scenes finally do come. It is page after page of prehistoric life and the solving of a seeming murder, and a couple of accidents and woolly mammoths. The sex is mainly groping and over. I kept reding to see what would happen to skin, but Tooth and Bat were far more interesting characters, and Wolf, though why she had to be a midget I have no idea and everyone's motivations, such as they were for Neanderthals, were so simple as to be dull.  Not even sex drove them. Very long winded and would have benefitted from a lot more dramatic tension. And a lot more variety.	2003-09-18

The author has created supeb characters and the whole villain this is unsustained, confusing, predictable, and waters down what should be the terrific feel good ending to the novel.<br />Dominic is way too good to be true, in an interesting role reversal in which he tries to maintain his virtue in the face of her lust for him.<br />She is a bit too fey at times, and puts one in mind of cold Comfort Farm. The menagerie is adorable, and the only othr flaw I can find is the author working really hard to balance the heady romance aspect with the recovery aspect. Dom has the patience of a saint. It sort of drags on a bit as well, especially with her sticking henna all over everyone, and dressing in costumes like a child at play when she is 23 years old. No matter how traumatised she is, she would have more common sense.  The pairing off of the supposed eunuch, as well as Dom's sister Lucia also makes for one couple too many in this rather short book.<br />I also have to say I did not like the sanctimonious Kyle at all, for all he is supposed to be in love with his mistress and helping her, and is set up as the hero of her next book China Bride with a really heavy hand. The fashion for twins in books is getting a bit much.<br />An uneven achievement at best, but read this book for Dom. He is FAB.	2003-09-03

There is hardly any supernatural aspect, or any menage a trois with the PA, and theending is like something straight out of a really bad Harlequin/Mills and Boon romance. the interesting characters are tidied out of the way and the dominant Nicholas does nothing but have her hobble around with her kickers around her knees. Even worse is the fact that the author breaks the basic rules of show, not tell, by having the heroine Christabel recall the events after they have already happened rather than lead up to them and then follow through...I say she should have run away with Gussie, or her brother, and dumped Nicholas with his PA Jamie.<br />Totally lacks heat and spice.

The whole relationhip build up with Jessica and Dash never amounted to anything, and her relationship with the man of her dreams was also a final epilgoue in the last five pages of the book. Another female characcter in Sasha, and some stuff straight out oa Harelquin romance, made this book really tedious.  I was looking for something a lot more intense.

The bit at theend where he is so ill seems to go on forever and the book generally seemed too long for a very light-weight story with characters who lacked depth. His sister was dire.

They all end up sounding like wooden Indians.  There is also excessive fixation on butts. But other than that, she gets a wide variety of experiences. the hero is a fun and intriguing character, even if he does turn out to be a bit too good to be true in places. It can also be a bit too much of the same thing when she recreates the scenes from the Victorian erotic diary. On the whole, though, a good read. Especially the end in London.	2003-08-11

The BDSM side of things is sort of tacked on in various places, never really integrated into the book and dan as the good guy cop just never really fits in anywhere etiehr. then there is jonathan, far more interesting to my mind than any of the other men, and he is left dangling  with all sorts of even darker bdsm tendencies hinted at. Her boss is a waste of space, and we never really get to see what happens with her charging young assistant. The only other women in the book get very little play time, and the whole ending looks like a mash where the author reliased she was running out of space and just gave up.<br />Still, the first half of the book is enough to rev your engine, so I gave it 2 stars.	2003-08-11

She wants to have sex with him but doesn't trust him and is a most unpleasant person right the way through the book. Even her love for her sons does not redeem her.<br />As for the supposed villain of the peace, the whole thing is so flimsy and ridiculous as to be totally unbelievable, and ayone with half a brain would know her and Delacourt's secret. A light read for people who really don't care too much about anything other than plot.<br />The violent SM Bondage scene is really totally out of keeping with character and is not in the least sexy. In fact the book has about as much sizzle as a damp firework. Her debut novel was good, this was appallingly bad. She breaks the basic rule of any good writing, show not tell.  She gives details about her characters and situations with all of the pompousness of Dickens and none of the flair or interest.	2003-07-28

Neither character has any real depth, and apart from [physical activity], nothing in common.  Their forced marriage is so wretched it is a wonder it lasts as long as it does, especially since Bentley does so many stupid things any sensible woman would never trust him and walk out.<br />The whole issue with his family squabble is nearly pointless even taken in the context of his supposed deep dark secret which any reader with half a brain could figure out.<br />When it is revealed the whole book diverts away from the love story. Poor old Freddie gets a final mention in the book, and that is it.  The recurrence of characters from her previous books No True Gentleman and A Woman Scorned, who were never that interesting to begin with are also a big yawn.<br />Reminder to all-a romance is two people falling in love. Not having plain [physical activity]and trying to make the best of a bad job when she gets pregnant.<br />Any sensuality in this book would have been a relief.

But the swing in his character from hard man of the world who cynically sleeps with his twin brothers fiancee to prove she is a tart, to man who wants to be loved and not alone is way too abrupt. Coming as it does in the middle of an orgy it is just absurd.<br />In addition, the author cheats the reader on a nomuber of levels. There are so few real love scenes in the book, it is depressing. Also, they are very tame, and the week they spend together is summed up in sentences like 'they were inseparable for three days.' Boring.<br />Then it goes into the really absurd effort for him to try to find his arch enemy; he seems most inept for a spy, and the idea of having the ordies to keep an eye on all his enemies is also ridiculous. He makes the twin brother Damien look like a twit in the end as well, pretty much effectively ruining him for the sequle Lord of Ice she had planned. Making him propose to Alice to save her from Lucien is just silly, but even worse is Lucien's reaction-he is like a drunken Neanderthal, and if what he does does not ruin his chances with her, it should do. Is this supposed to be revenge for his sleeping with Caro at the start of the book?  We can see the supposed plot twists and turns coming a mile off. A really intriguing book for about the first 60 pages, and all down hill from there. I would love to see meaty, believable characters and some real engagement of feeling and sensuality. This is my third book by Foley, and all of them are from this emotional distance it is like the writer is observing them through a really thick pane of glass. The Duke was bad, Lady Desire was worse, this is the worst.	2003-07-03

First off, there are so many historical and grammatical inaccuracies, it was painful to read. There is no excuse for such shabby editing in this day and age with spellcheckers etc, and an editor who should have a degree in English.<br />Second of all, the hero was an idiot and she was not much better.  The whole predicament she finds herself in is worthy of farce, not romance.<br />The sinister undertones were never developed, and Belinda  goes from being skittish of Robert to orally pleasuring him at the drop of a hat almost as soon as they meet. This from a woman who was supposed to have been a virgin who was brutally raped. who decides to solve the problem by becoming a high-priced courtesan. If she was happy selling oranges to earn a decent living so she would not have to compromise her virtue, this transition is ridiculous.<br />The hero going off and practically killing her rapist with a steel pipe and stuffing him on a prison hulk to Australia, thus acting as judge, jury and executioner, is not endearing either. He is a prude, full of barely suppressed violence, and their first 'love scene' together on the dining room able is absurd and gross on every level given her history and that fact that he is supposed to be a Paragon.<br />He is cruel, judgemental, hypocritical. Instructing his own sister to ignore his mistress in public is just awful.  his political standpoint is equally terrible. He is a repressive Tory with a small social conscience but is so worried about what other people think of him he allows himself to always be led into doing things which are basically against humanity. You would think at the age of 35 he might be able to get over what his Daddy and other people think of him, but he would rather placate the tabbies of the Town than be kind to Bel. Would be willing to go through an arranged marriage to get political power, and still expect Bel to stay with him as though nothing had changed, even knowing she refuses to take any married lovers. He doesn't ever love her for herself, but who he wants her to be in relation to all HIS needs.<br />Our heroine Bel is so inconsistent she then starts calling him darling and  lavishing every endearment upon him the minute she goes into the house to live with him.

We are supposed to believe he has supernatural powers, we are supposed to think he is a ghost. Then he is an amnesia victim, but somehow he recalls all sorts of things about his past life. She is supposed to be a Private Eye sent by his sister. The motives of all the villains are not threshed out clearly, and the book just has too many inconsistencies. The characters also lack depth-I mean, this is Harlequin but they should still be something other than their jobs or medical conditions-we never do get to find out why they fall in love so intently in the first place seven years ago, let alone now.  And the fact that they already love each other diminishes the tension. Since we don't believe in the villains or the insuperable obstacles, we don't believe in their love and commitment either.	2003-06-19

None of the characters have depth , and the degree of either sensuality or witty repartee is totally lacking.  Fine if you have nothing better to pass the time with, but this is not a stand out novel, and it is quite telling that there is a request at the back of the book for aspiring authors to start submitting proposals.

They have all of the depth of a shallow pool and are completely unbelievable. We are supposed to take as gospel the demure ballet dancing school teacher turning croupier and femme fatale, sun bathing topless in the middle of a jungle with a dozen body guards and just happening to meet the  guy she had a three-night stand with as she, a virgin, picked him up in a bar and locked herself in her hotel room with him for that long.<br /> Add to that fact that she would not be glad to see him since he is such a jerk, and you have all the makings of a really gross novel in which he treats her like an object on a continual basis. The ending is so ridiculous as to not even be credited as she decides she is going to fight the villain and the supposed hero just allows Delaine to be carved up with a knife. Give us a break. Entertainment is one thing, ... stupidity with no basis in reality and not the least bit of sensuality or romance is quite another.	2003-06-19

Since the couple are already married, and have already made love, there is none of the tension involved in a genuine romance. She learns to change herself to be worthy of him, the supposed villains get their comeuppance, and the whole issue of her having been raped repeatedly for seven months by a Spanish partisan is swept under the carpet neatly. The whole lost identity and found father is just absurd and the long long cast of characters and the maiden auntie's romance thrown in for good measure is just dull. These characters all look as though they are intended for spins offs, we get so much detail, but the essence of romance is the couple meeting and falling in love. Not knowing her for 4 years and marrying her to protect her virtue, then losing her on the battle field and forgetting she ever existed until she turns up again. There is no sensuality or joy in this book and the hero and heroine are both spineless.	2003-06-17

He is so uncouth that his supposed reform is completely unbelieveable. There is no real romance or sensuality-the only two love scenes in the book are depressingly brief and belittling. He treats her like a whore, and anyone who has stand-up sex in the theatre toilet alcove is just begging to be ruined. The fact that she isn't is a minor miracle, as is the fact that someone with an pretensions to intelligence at all, as the heroine has, should have steered clear a million miles from such a debauched man. His decision to marry her is downright insulting and the ending trite, clich&eacute;, and completely unbelievable as well. This novel makes light of adultery, orphans and a whole host of social ills in an attempt to bre witty and amusing, and it falls flat because the 'hero' is so callus and her own family are also odious.

Jane is the typical heroine who starts out mousy and then shows her true colours. She may see some redeeming features in Jocelyn, but most of us would not. He is a fraud and has no notion of how to love anyone except himself. As for her, she is accused of murder and yet does nothing to try to help herself. He has to sort out all her problems for her, and then she is angry when he does.<br /> The getting to know each other part works out well enough, but the whole novel is watered down by the continuous and ridiculous vendetta of the Forbes brothers when Jocelyn has supposedly slept with their sister and allows everyone to go on thinking it even when his own bother is killed.<br />Yes, he may play the piano and paint like an angel but he has few redeeming features and the way he speaks to Jane and treats her is appalling. The so-called love scenes are extremely unsexy, along the lines of a business arrangement, and his hatred of her when he feels he has been betrayed is appalling.  Her 'betrayal' consists of not having quite worked up the courage to tell him that she is wanted for murder.  She wants to have one happy month with him before she turns herself in and faces the consquences, except they get one week and then he finds out. In any event, this would not be something most people would blurt out to a man who has told her he just wants her for sex, nothing more.<br />His insistence that he must marry her because she is an earl's daughter, and his resentment because of this, is offensive in the extreme and we never get a true sense of commitment at all. The ending where the boring beau tries to get her back is also throwing up yet another obstacle in the path of the couple, leaving us with the sense that he only married her so no one else could have her as if she is some horse bought at Tattersall's. I prefer my heroines with more spine and my heroes less Neanderthal.  She tries to give us explanations for why he is like that, but in all honesty the past is the past and the very fact that he has a house to keep his mistress in shows he is not the kind of person who can be redeemed because all women are objects for his amusement only, including Jane throughout the book.s Neanderthal.

Both have loved and lost and so are fearful of getting involved with each other, but anyone can see Blue and she are made for each other.<br />Interesting secondary characters create a very believable world. As always her heroes are divinely sexy, very manly, but perceptive and sensitive. The mystery element as she seeks her identity, which, if not entirely surprising. is handled well. A super read, one any lover of romance and women's fiction will really savour.

I can see he has had a hard life, but that is no excuse for what he does-he is driven solely by revenge.  Angry, mistrustful, and most certainly capable of betraying anyone and everyone, Victoria is thrust into his clutches and treated apallingly.<br />Also appalling in the book are sentences like 'Gabriel could even make rape pleasureable' as he does exactly that to her in a back door scene which would make any reader of romance cringe, and even himself cringes as he tried to doctor her tuch after he is done with her!<br />Aslo cringeworthy:  the graphically detailed description of his last female lover, and what he did to her (fisted). There is also the lesbian modiste who fits her for dresses and does the most fascinating things with a tape measure and a feather.  There is substantial same sex content in this book considering it is supposed to be a romance.  Those who also are not interested in voyeurism in a brothel would like to give his book a miss.<br />His explanation for why he is like that and the reasons for it do not make sense at all.  The timetable and explanations are  all wrong.  That and the appallingly weak ending, are just a few more let downs in this generally bleak and grim book.<br />Gabriel's only redeeming feature was his friendship for Michael and even that is basically destroyed, or given a sexual component which make Gabriel even more selfish than he already is.<br />I can't see anyone as tame as Victoria redeeming a man like him, nor would she really want to.  Redeeming him by allowing him full sexual licence to treat her like a sex object does not really ring true. Sorry, but there is a difference between consensual sex and sensuality, and exploring boundaries, and the exploitation of every human being in this book.  It is erotica, certainly, if you like that sort of thing, but not romance. A happy ever after ending for this couple or Michael and Anne? I don't think so!hael and Anne? I don't think so!	2003-06-16

There were a few loose ends to be tied up at the end which the author lost sight of, like thinking he saw his friend and the rather lame ending with Priapus, but  on the whole it was a gripping read.  The quirky elements did not get to silly (Selena the tarot card reader, for example) and the essence of New Orleans was captured very well.  The main unbelievable point was how they could resist each other for a whole month spent in bed reading Peter Pan and the Iliad!  Not possible with a man that hunky.  The sensuality level was ok, but the only love scene a bit of a let down since we already knew what was going to happen because of Cupid's prophecy. Also, the whole stalker thing was resolved a bit too readily to my mind, and no one seems to be too upset by it in the end-not exactly true to life.  So on the whole, a fun read, and lot better than her other books.	2003-06-13

A couple of moderately warm scenes and 'a first time together scene' worthy of only the worst in 'romance' are totally forgettable.  Tying up virgins and abandoning them without a word of explanation is really not the way to their heart. There isn't enough heat between them to sustain these scenes.  A romance is the hero and heroine falling in love, not arguing continually and talking about nothing but sex (which they never do!)<br />Lucien is also completely inconsistent at times and there are big gaps in the story re the pirates and the death of his brother. Our heroine is a worthy match for him, but Elizabeth is apt to be far too changeable at times.<br />The comedy is clever and witty one minute, downright vulgar the next.  This would have been a much better book without it on the whole; after what Lucien has been through the brooding hero in the ruined castle is more consistent than the man who decides to ruin her reputation at a ball because he is bored, and ends up having to marry  her to save both their reputations. Witty repartee is one thing, challenges to seduce the servants (which she does go through with) and detailed descriptions of male anatomy quite another. not to mention deliberately embarrassing each other in public all the time because they have so little respect for one another, especially at their own wedding.<br />The whole of the book is littered with grammar and punctuation errors, making the whole seem even more slap dash. Ms. Britton writes with verve but she loses sight of what she is writing and the style and tone swings are far too glaring to make this a smooth easy read. She has some interesting and sexy characters and does not need to try so hard to make them so with feathers and powdered sugar and bananas. It just doesn't work. And has been done far better elsewhere, lots of times before.<br />One final point-most of the action takes place over 2 days on their honeymoon-all of her anguish and love is just not believable given the extent to which she and he hardly know each other.<br />Having said that I really like Lucien despite the flaws in the writing and his character, though the whole is he a rake or not was really not handled very well or clearly at all.  I would love to have seen some real intimacy between them in the epilogue.  On the whole, an entertaining read, but I hope the next book will be a lot better.to make them so with feathers and powdered sugar and bananas. It just doesn't work.

My first quibble is I really did not like Riana the heroine very much-even her brothers tell her she isn't the kind of woman suited to Tynan and she has to grow and develop throughout the book to be worthy of him. She is emotionally dishonest and a real cow as well as coward at times. He change of heart happens a bit too suddenly in the last 20 pages or so of the book. Lots of loose ends were NOT tied up, a cheat for the reader, especially as there is not a series so far as I can see.<br />My main quibble is that it could have done with much better editing. There were absurd typos and grammatical mistakes which any editor with half a brain should have picked up on and it diminished the overall power of the author's work.<br />I also was not convinced by the details of what happened in Ireland and his Catholicism-it is not something that can be hidden that easily, and he was a bit too mercurial at times.  The getting to know you part of the romance was excellent, but there seems very little to love about her at times, and even she accuses him of just being obsessed with her breasts, which you can hardly blame the guy for if she is always flashing them at him.  Intense sensuality within he bounds of taste make this an excellent read despite the quibbles.	2003-06-03

There were a couple of bad bits like the romance scenes being a bit too wooden and lacking in sensuality, and his long mane of golden hair flowing all over the place got to be a bit silly after a while. The Don was also a bit too Alpha male at times, but given his nature and the curse that is to be forgiven.	2003-06-03

Inserting raspberries and back door action doesn't really do it for me nor for a lot of other readers, I suspect.<br />Apart from that there is not much sizzle in the book at all, and his consummation of their relationship in a carriage is not the least romantic. The only thing that as improved is the sex is finally consensual in the book; often in a Kleypas novel it isn't.<br />Amanda is a twit-she lets' herself be talked out of her relationship and neither of them seem to c are enough about he other to fight for each other.

In fact, I think she has the potential to be a really spicy writer.<br />Alas, she has tried to go mainstream romance paranormal in this book and has ended up with a hopeless hash that her editor really should have known better than to publish.<br /><br />The first complaint-the loves scenes are so toned down no as to be total plain vanilla between the hero and the heroine. But she commits the cardinal sin of having her heroine have a really spicy romance scene at the start of the book with her ex, and the lion's share of the rest of the 'loves scenes' is the manipulative woman who is the heroine's enemy using her power on an unsuspecting priest and the hero's brother.<br />Repeat after me: a romance is a hero and heroine falling in love.<br /> There are only three scenes which really count between the hero and heroine and the rest is her disguised as a hawk. She is an upyr, a half vampire half werewolf, but the supernatural bits are not really thrilling enough or fully consistent in the book. There was no genuine commitment or even conversation between the couple-I could never figure out why he was supposed to be so heroic. He was a knight at Poitiers? So were lots of others. The obsessive sister in law as villain is also pretty weak.  The truly intriuing characters get no real airtime, like her 'father'-but why introduce so many if it is only going to detract from the couple.<br />Ms. Holly is undoubtedly a writer with talent, but Beyond Seduction and Beyond Innocence were actually better than this novel because at least she was writing with some verve and style, and some passion, even if they were not very typical of what romance readers want (proposed menage a quatres and back door action, for example).<br />Some of the sentences in this book were unreadable.  There are plenty of other werewolf and vampire stories far more sensual (or erotic if you prefer).

Like all first novels, it really should have been relegated to the bottom drawer, kept as an embarrassing example of how not to write, in this case,  how not to write a 'romance.'<br />The book starts out with a masturbating heroine in the 20th century and a husband practically raping his wife in the 19th to get his conjugal rites at last. The sexually frustrated wife Elaine somehow swaps bodies with the frigid wife Morrigan-I read the whole book and never grasped how this happened.<br />But willing to suspend my disbelief and revulsion I read on. An on and on. And the book only got worse, if possible. Every single 'romantic scene' was the husband trying to exercise his conjugal rights, though it took him ages and lots of very repetitive groping to do so. His idea of foreplay is to grab her nipples or see how many fingers he can fit.<br />Even worse was the incest, near-beastiality with a bull, and every single bodily function known to human kind being performed in front of Elaine/Morrigan to show her who is boss by either her loopy relatives or her husband.  Since she is so fearful of giving the game away that she is from the 20th century she hardly ever speaks throughout the entire novel  except to say, \\"No, don't,\\" as the supposed hero forces himself on her once more.<br />Her objections to the hero are very real, for apart from being so revolting, she is in essence committing adultery against her husband in her own time<br />If I didn't know better I would have said this was a parody of a romance novel, but the writer's alternating of gothic horror with slapstick shows she really has no idea how to stick to one thing and do it well.<br />Even more ludicrous is that the Neanderthal hero Charles is supposed to be an expert on Tantric love practices designed for maximum gratification. But apart from showing her some mildly spicy pictures in the kama sutra he is plain vanilla missionary position all the way, and every single experience she has with him is painful on the physical level and degrading on the mental one. Even a 20th century guy would get two black eyes for the revolting things he does and the way he treats her, let alone someone in 1883.  Then we are supposed to believe they have fallen in love and he is glad that she has come from another century and can't go back to her own time? They never even have a conversation. Even after she is nearly raped and killed he ignores her for three days while he tries to decide whether or not to lock her in a loony bin!<br />Finally, the villain of the piece, a creature who can supposedly go into any body at all, and used to be Morrigan, murders various people and becomes the randy Pillsbury doughboy-the author's words, not mine.  And decides that it wants to know what it is like to have sex with itself with Elaine in its former body. I mean, really!<br />This book is easily the worst example I have ever read of an author doing anything to shock the readers even at the expense of basic common sense and taste. ... Not erotica, and certainly not romance, I would give this negative stars if I could. It was laughably bad when it wasn't totally disgusting.

I love Luna and Thomas; they are a terrific couple, really HOT and Taos New Mexico is really brought to life. Her daughter is a wonderful character too and also the secondary characters Tiny and Maggie.<br />It is not a perfect book, but it is really excellent. I read it in one sitting, just like her first. This one will not make you cry gallons, though. It is much more upbeat.  The use of Maggie the teen's diary is I think the only weak part in the book, since I really wanted more of a smoochy scene with Luna and Thomas at the end of the novel. But then I am an avid romance reader. One other minor flaw is the start of the book really lurched a bit and could have benefitted from a much better editor who could pick up the niggling little errors like what time the daughter's flight landed.<br /> This book is an excellent cross over thought for women who like good fiction, and anyone looking for a book which affirms the healing power of love and the fact that god really does work in mysterious ways. All I can say is, I can't wait for her next one!	2003-05-19

He tells her she has to sleep with him in order to make up for her brother ruining his sister's life with a thwarted elopement. As if ruining one woman is going to make up for it?<br />He treats her like a tart, and then wonders why everyone else does as well? He next agrees to tutor her in how to please a man so when he inevitably dumps her she will be able to get a higher price on the open market, when all he has to do is stop the vendetta against her brother so they can keep their home and fortune. He is a disgusting human being who leaves her open to scandal, ruin, VD, and rape at an orgy set up by his friends.<br />The heroine says it all when he attempts feebly to propose to her to try to keep her for his own selfish reasons. He is the kind of man she couldn't love. He doesn't know how to love. He is a rake and a user with no redeeming features except, as he says himself, an ability to make money, which he then throws at every problem.<br />In the last 20 or so pages of the book he then `reforms' and gives her lavish gifts for her services rendered which any woman with an ounce of self-respect would refuse. The brothel scene is really the last straw. She is just an object to swive, not even with his own natural endowments most of the time, if you take my meaning. There was no love, tenderness or commitment in this book, and the saccharine sweet romance between the sister and brother is the only high point of this otherwise awful novel.<br />I would give it negative stars if I could. Spicy is one thing, but there is no romance. And the writing style is so poor that the word `erotic' appeared on virtually every single page of every single sex scene. Of which there were way too many.  Please can we have some characters that speak and develop and grow, not pieces of anatomy that go up and down, in and out, round and round etc.<br />.	2003-05-19

He doesnt really want to be married,  but a recent brush with death makes him long for a son. No love or trust is ever really developed in the relationship, especially when he initiates their wedding night by saying she is going to have to go ahead and consummate the relationship sooner or later so she might as well get on with it. When she says no a second time later on in the book he just plows on ahead anyway.<br />Then she makes the bargain that as soon as a son is born she can leave. Well what woman in their right mind is simply going to dump their baby? He agrees to it and tells her fine, but if she wants the baby she has to initiate all the lovemaking from now on. Whoahe was the one who wanted the baby.  So he makes her jump through hoops to please him in every way while he just lies back and occasionally participates. It is about as romantic as watching grass grow. Finally he decides she has betrayed him and is going to kill her.<br />Her ambivalence in the marriage has been a-she has no idea who he is because he never spends any time with her apart from forcing his conjugal rights. And b-part of a supposed gipsy curse and she decides she loves him despite everything.<br />The paranormal aspect is thin but seems the only explanation for her putting up with the appalling way he treats her throughout the entire marriage right up to the last 20 pages of the book.  Another turkey from an author who thinks that sex scenes equal romance, and cant avoid the word erotic. The definite is ending to arouse sexual desire. The only thing these scenes arouse in me is a desire to throttle any author who portrays non-consensual sex as a given which women just have to put up with, and really like after all anyway because no one in their right mind can resist a rake.

The life depicted on stage as so wonderful Julia would never dream of giving it up is ridiculous given the nature of the theatre in this period of history, and especially given how actresses were treated.<br />A little bit of fluff to pass the time, but don't expect any real romance or high drama except between the actress and her father (or was that melodrama...)	2003-05-05

This is straight out of Johanna Lindsay, only far less well done. Kell  feels sorry for her, realises she is a virgin, she writhes all over him, he goes to sleep!! She tries to ravish him, he still falls asleep!<br />She shoots him, he shrugs it off and tells her to marry him. In the most UNromantic wedding night in the history of  literature he tells her to get on with it and lies back on the pillows with his arms behind his head! And there is another scene just like it later in the book! Sweep ladies off their feet much, Kell? I don't think so.<br />The book goes on forever, and fizzles  to a halt at the end, where the rampant alpha male hero famous for having the most spectacular gaming den in London lives happily ever after looking for an orphanage to run.<br /> I mean, really!<br />Every time the action  slows, which is frequently, the author  throws in a gratuitous sex scene with a fantasy lover, so that we never really get to see Raven and Kell interact apart from  the three awful so called love scenes previously mentioned.<br />I also don't believe they ever spend enough time with each other apart from the last 20-20 pages of the book for them to get to know each other well enough to fall in love.<br />Everything was so restrained and tepid, and even the supposed really wild erotic scene in the make believe pirate ship in the brothel was dull and predictable.  If I read the word breast one more time I was going to scream.<br />The villain of the piece is not in the least sinister, just mentally disturbed and rather pathetic.<br />I must say this has to be one of the dullest and most unromantic romances I've ever read.  A bit of dialogue and bonding between the characters would have been welcome.<br />The sexual tension is almost non-existent:  \\"You're my wife, so fulfill my physical needs.\\" \\"All right, dear,  it's only sex after all. You mean nothing to me.\\"<br />\\"Fine. You mean nothing to me either.\\"<br />Charming.  We can well believe it for both of them. Give this one a miss for sure!

I don't know what authors are thinking about making their heroines bumbling or witchy fools. Falling all over the place in the middle of a storm, nearly tearing his shorts off twice, and her awful singing really destroy the suspenseful atmosphere the author was rally struggling (and usually failing) to create.<br />Essentially, we don't like Tally, so we really don't care what happens to her and the hero deserves better. But even he gets wearing after a while.  Everything else is down hill from the first 40 pages on. The love scenes have all been done so much better elsewhere. A big yawn.

There is quite a lot of sizzle in the book, and some fairly erotic scene with a few sexual practices and discussions of sexual practices which some readers might find shocking. But it is labelled an erotic romance, and for once the book lives up to its label.<br />The only thing is, there is SO much discussion of what he is going to do to her that by the time he ever does it, it is a bit of an anti-climax. (if you will pardon the phrase).<br />The heroine as a person never really moves beyond victim of what men do to her and even we find it incredible that for al she is supposed to be 36 years old and untouched she does the things she does in THREE DAYS (and nights) when she forges her supposed relationship with Michael.<br />The gruesome ending also does not take into account her very genuine trauma, and the supposition that he is a prostitute because he likes women so much is as ludicrous as saying that women do it for the same reason. Gabriel the male prostitute for men really sends it over the top.<br /> The whole money is power, sex is power issue is really fudged and the men seem as powerless as the women as they are driven by their need for revenge. The sheer repetitiveness of the book goes from effective to annoying.<br />All of them seem one dimensional wind-up toys with a bunch of sexual hang ups or perversions which I can't imagine anyone being 'entertained' by. The book has so little plot and action apart from flashbacks which Michael keeps recalling over and over again, that could have been a short story.<br />Full marks for erotic, negative marks for perceptiveness, entertainment and storyline.	2003-05-01

Well, what do you expect from the town's walking male hormone?<br />The love scenes are about as spicy as yogurt.<br />Zane is an ok character, but we seldom see what he sees in her apart from her being the damsel in distress. The whole sinister someone is out to get her is ridiculous and predictable, the motives absurd.<br />The ending is a real let down. I was never convinced that they were totally in love in the TWO DAYS that it takes for them to start doing the hearts and flowers and wild thing thing, le alone two weeks. The ending doesn't convince me either.<br />Once again, a trite formula romance with the love scene on page 200. Please, give us a break. Aren't there any really passionate and genuinely erotic love stories any more that aren't bogged down by eccentric relatives, farce, cutesy children, or dogs?	2003-04-30

It's like everything happened 4 years ago when they first slept together, so why bother making them fall in love. But pouting is not attractive in any romance heroine, any more than sexist alpha male posturing is for the hero. This book has far too much of both.<br />There is far too much crass and slapstick humour to give the book any sizzle at all.<br />The most thrilling romantic thing in the whole book is a massage using oil and then sex?  Really. Use a bit of imagination here! Yawn.<br />If this is spicy, everyone in the universe must eat paper.<br />Gabriel leaves me neutral as a hero-he really doesn't have enough spine or personality to care about him one way or the other, and his motives for revenge also do not bode well for the couple.<br />Dodd was recommended as an author to me, but I have most definitely read better. This book has no real romance, just a pacy story line with lots of men running around wielding their weapons.  Make of that sentence what you will!<br />The ending is a real disappointment, designed only to lead up to the next book in the series, and thus a real failure to tie up the loose ends in the novel and convince us this couple has a hope of being in love, or being in love for all time.  A romance is about a couple falling in love. The sooner some so-called romance writers remember that, the better.	2003-04-25

Good writing has a wonderful ebb and flow, but this just kept going around in the same dull circles as she rejects him at every turn for no really good reasons that any person can see.<br />I never got the real sense of commitment I needed, and the supposedly sexy and salacious details mainly came from a journal that is so badly written, even if it is supposed to be in French, as to be laugable.<br />I never believe in the heroines's love for him when she finall says she will settle down-he just thunks her into sexual submission with him setting himself a two week challenge to win her.<br />When the fiance predictably comes back, she acts as if she could not care less about poor Nick.<br />Aurora is totally missnamed-instead of the Dawn, she is dusk, totally grim and uninspiring.<br />To add to the confusion we have Nick's sister Raven, his friend Lucian and her fiance all falling in love! Worse than any Shakespeare play.

Yet she allows him to take all sort of liberties including tying her up, oral sex, and having it off with himself all over the place and her (sorry, there is no other way to put it.)<br />Most of the time she is a passive recipient to all that is done to her, and she is just an object. There is only one full-on scene when he finally really makes love to her and she gets to engage in the action, and it is so weak as to  be really dull and anti-climactic. It is all the way at the end of the book-hundred of pages of nothing but gushing and will they won't they at last. Ugh.<br />I can understand the fooling around without actual sex in terms of historical accuracy because he fears her getting pregnant, and does not want to do the dirty on his brother.<br />What I don't understand is scene after scene of it which never really advances the story very much and does  not appear to do anything to advance the 'love' part in the book. At times it is as romantic as an anatomy lesson.<br />And the numerous rude words for his anatomy are all gratuitous-I mean, the girl would have to have lived in a nunnery to not know even the rudiments of what things are called.<br />There is no sexual awakening for her, just his pursuit to what he wants in the end. I can't see any woman getting caught up in this book, or feeling swept away by love, just boredom.<br />The author has an interesting facility for language, but lacks the full package of emotional intensity and a real joyous feel good factor at the end so that the reader is convinced of the happy ever after with real commitment, not just ravening lust (and not even much of that).	2003-04-21

But it was so wordy that it really took a while to get going.<br />Rule number one of romance--never start a book with a weather report, and graphic descriptions of physical brutality as the hero enjoys pummeling three men witless.<br />It was also so littered with tons of secondary characters with impossible names and titles, that it was like wading through Debrett's.<br />All of the standard regency slang was piled up everywhere it could be fit.  There were so many scenes with the hero and heroine separated I wondered if they were ever going to have a real conversation!!<br />The hero Kit is completely inconsistent, and while charming, is not really a heart throb for me at all. He seems neither one thing nor another, neither rake nor noble gentleman.<br />As for the heroine, she is so insipid as to be as dull as she claims to be. The four love scenes are equally so. There was never any real heat between them at all.<br />Heat? Yes, the kind of gut-wrenching desire Kit felt for his brother's fiancee, who we are then supposed to believe Kit just gives up on when she becomes available and in fact engaged to him thanks to his father. Kit balks because he does not wish to be married or have things decided for him, but he alienated his whole family for his ex Freyja. Then he jilts her for a milksop he is only using to deceive his family with? No way!  You get the feeling he is settling, and the happy ending at the end is really not convincing.<br />The introduction of the obnoxious Bedwyn clan in order to further them in the next three books by the author, which they have promotion for all over the place in the book front and back, further muddied the already murky waters. I am really starting to dislike novels where the author is so determined to set you up for the rest of the series, that they forget that romance is supposed to focus on ONE magical couple falling in love.<br />Overblown style in some places, crude in others, it was a real mish-mash.

Long winded descriptions of the decor when she is supposed to be giving us info on the hero, and even longer passages from the point of view of Roger the villain right at the start of the book make it exceptionally hard to get into.<br />Basic rule of romance: the hero and heroine fall in love!<br />They also usually need to be in the same room for this to happen, yet they all go haring off all over the place.<br />I never get convinced about Colton really wanting to marry her and it takes until about page 375 of anything to hot up in the book. Fron them on it is all plot-driven and confusing as she tried to give us some 'surprising twists' and turns which quite frankly were not (even given the directionless mess of the narrative), and may offend some readers. Not just because of the gruesome subject matter, but because they are handled in such a gratuitous way. (miscarriage, rape, abuse, assault)<br />The second strand of the plot with Felicity and the third with the identity of the baby all get in the way of was watching the  couple as they supposedly fall in love. It is more like an exercise in willfulness than love, or even lust. Endless reams of detail on the wolfhounds also seriously detracts.  The continual introduction of pets and babies into romances shold definitely be banned!<br />As for the love scenes, by the time we get any we really could not care less.  But they are so badly written, with the world's most unromantic dialogue that one wonders why they ever bothered to marry. And he is constantly grabbing her buttocks for the rest of the book-not the world's best idea of sweeping a girl off her feet except on the mundanely practical level. Really juvenile.<br />Very disappointing. Above all, it could really have used a good editor who would have stopped all the maundering and repetitive sections that went around and around, supposedly adding to suspense or depth of character, but really just irking the reader.

This is much better than Hidden Heiress, with a couple who has some sizzle and a hero who, even if he is the Scarlet Pimpernel in a kilt,  has depth and intrigue. (The author admits this happily herself at the end of the book).<br />The trouble with this author is that she reallty seems to work SO hard at making a series by setting up the next book with his long lost cousin that it waters down the romance and also really detracts from the fabulous Alex.<br />And her women are all vacuous, slightly mad, or shrews. Bab is a pain, always whining about how bored she is if she isn't out hunting, and all the talk about paddling her bottom like a child gets wearing. It was the same in Hidden Heiress.<br />Also all the to-ing and fro-ing about whether or not she will wed him.  In the end she does nothing because, as with the other novels, a spell has been cast over them both, and so they never really develop the love and commitment we hope to see.<br />Fin and Molly make an apperance in this novel as in Hidden Heiress, but there is no sign of her own brother Patrick, even at her own wedding, is really strange.<br />The wee fairy folk are not quite so irritating this time, nor quite so libidinous, which is just as well really as that took away from the last novel.<br />We have two middling romantic scenes in this book so readers looking for sensuality will be sadly bereft.<br />Finally, her ability to control her characters' accents is still sorely lacking. Her antecdents as a Regency novelist really start to show when all of the typical &lt;i&gt;Ton&lt;i/&gt; slang starts to creep in.<br />This is an author with a good talent for description who likes complicated plots, enjoys writing about the men, but forgets the &lt;i&gt;women&lt;i/&gt; are the characters female readers tend to empathise with or identify when they are reading romance.<br />But there is nothing likeable about Bab (Barbara) and one wishes Alex had done better for himself!x had done better for himself!	2003-03-25

This book never really takes off at all on a number of really glaring levels if this is supposed to be a 'romance.'<br />It is clear from the start that Elspeth and Patrick are destined to fall in love, so since it is all magic, there is little suspense or romantic tension. I would have loved to see some sizzle!<br /><br />The only sizzle are the copulating supernatural characters sucking each other's toes, and the eagerly swiving King James fondling every wench in sight when his lairds are all rebelling. Not too thrilling.<br />Even worse is to come, however!  I can see that the author is setting up for the next book in the series by introducing Patrick's sister Bab and her would-be suitor Alex, (no suspense there, eh?)  but it kills the romance to have Patrick treating Elspeth the same as his sister, and constantly threatening to spank her like a two-year old.<br />Likewise his seemingly unrequited passion for his best friend Fin's wife Molly detracts from his romance for Elspeth. Sorry, but it makes it much more gripping to have only one couple in a romance, with some real spark, not three of four with none.<br />On a practical level, the fact that Elspeth is known as Beth, Bethie, Bessie, and Elizabeth as well makes for confusion.  The reams of information on how to train a hawk are interesting but really not romantic at all.<br />There is no believable affection or heat between Patrick and Elspeth, and his accent shifts from the King's English right the way to Gaelic so often it is a wonder she could ever posibly trust him to get close to him,  let alone understand half of what he is going on about.<br />All of the characters are one-dimensional-the equivalent of the evil step mother and two step sisters, the decent guardian who is completely ineffectual against them. Out of the whole vast cast of characters, no one jumps out at us.<br />It is a totally unsexy version of Cinderella. Any of the suspenseful bits, for example the supposedly exceedingly nasty Earl of Angus who completely drops out of the picture once Elspeth's mother Nell escapes, and the whole danger of  Elspeth being killed, are badly mishandled and thus not effective.<br />Even the supernatural elements become, not magical or romantic, but silly and absurd.<br />This author has some very good ideas, but gets so bogged down in details and plot she forgets we are supposed to  have some characters that we really want to care about and root for to the happy ever after ending.<br />As a light read, it could be fine, but tipping the scale at four hundred pages or so, you really need to have stamina, a huge tolerance for boredom and saccharine 'romance', and nothing else to do with your time.y of the suspenseful bits, for example the supposedly exceedingly nasty Earl of Angus who completely drops out of the picture once Elspeth's mother Nell escapes, and the whole danger of  Elspeth being killed, are badly mishandled and thus not effective.  <br />Even the supernatural elements become, not magical or romantic, but silly and absurd.  <br />This author has some very good ideas, but gets so bogged down in details and plot she forgets we are supposed to  have some characters that we really want to care about and root for to the happy ever after ending.<br />As a light read, it could be fine, but tipping the scale at four hundred pages or so, you really need to have stamina, a huge tolerance for boredom and saccharine 'romance', and nothing else to do with your time.	2003-03-24

Here goes.<br />A-Storyline really lame-the ending in particularly is completely unbelieveable and pathetic.<br />b-Sex scenes left me cold. No ring of truth to the pleasure or sensuality, very very repetitive, mostly rear door for her as well as the guys,  and very little directed at the woman's pleasure despite being from the female's perspective. She just gets wet as she watches most of the time and waits her turn in quite a sad way.<br />c-lots of rear-door stuff focusing on the guys' own feelings and kicks, so if this is supposed to be women's erotic fiction, sorry, but I am a woman, not that interested.<br />Not to mention the fact that the guy i supposed to be so HUGE for the woman it sounds totally painful and unappealing. (not that it is in real life, but would be enough to give a woman who had not tried it or a guy  nightmares for the rest of their life!)<br />d-lots of info on how to get off guys, their butts, foreskins etc.  but reads like an anatomy lesson at times.<br />e-secondary character the villainness and her s and m totally gratuitous as were. All the details of other people doing it-i would have rather seen the main characters do more of it!<br />f-the fantasy ranged from absolutely brutal sexual battle of wills with whips and chains, to the most lame guy doing it to school girl in navy blue uniform fantasies-the fact that both guys had similar fantasies which went on for page after page just made it tedious.<br />g-the fivesome with the lesbian and the male transvestite boinking in the window seat. I mean, really. sad.<br />h-loses its way after the first third of the book, so to sustain it for another 200 pages is almost pointless. It really just flaps about limply rather than driving to a conclusion, if you will forgive the comparison. Months pass in the novel, yet hardly anything happens except the sex scene per chapter.<br />i-Joe's character's transformation at the end-totally not credible.  I ended up not liking him.<br />j-The heroine-not much to like there. Game for a laugh and a screw, but in terms of personality, I can't figure out what these guys like about her!<br />We never see a normal conversation-their mouths are usually too full or they are gagged or doing the sexual roleplay.<br />And there isn't enough chemistry between the woman and either of the two men to make this interesting. the guys are totally made for each other, she is thrown in as a spare part(s) most of the time.<br />I think if it were going to be the ultimate female fantasy, then she has to get swept off her feet by both men, not them sweeping each other and grabbing her for the novelty. Guys may have a different interpretation of this.<br />I am as open-minded as the next person when it comes to human bodies etc. and have no problem with consenting adults doing these things if it really turns them on, but I got the feeling she was just trying to shock readers in this book, and failed to even do that, let alone turn me on.

They are all sombre and silent Heathcliff types who use sex as a way of entertaining themselves and as a weapon to control women. I never get the sense of any clear commitment from any of her couples, only women boinked into submission.<br />The women especially are all naive virigins who endure untold suffering losing their virginity in 'love' scenes which make me cringe and wonder how on earth and supposedly talented rake can be so indifferent to their feelings.<br />They are all just too flat and unbelieveable for me. About as sensual as a dead fish and just as exciting.	2003-03-21

Of course it could also have been because she lost track of her plot and did n ot tie up all the loose ends.<br />The books alternative between sweet romance and very sensual, and the heroine is not someone I ever get to really know and like.<br />That could be because the hero Hugo is the central character in the book from the opening pages, but I never really understand what she sees in him. He is an excellent character, if a bit uneven in places, and not the total Alpha male who ravishes everything in sight.<br />Still I cannot figure out why he would ever have left her so shamefully-even the reasons given do not ring true considering how much chemistry the two of them evidently have in bed.<br />Some of the subplot with rescuing the sister from a bad marriage is quite heavy handed and you can see the ending  coming a mile off.<br />A lot of it reads like a pastiche of other books like Collins' Moonstone and several bad Hollywood films.  I wouldn't mind seeing Hugo again in another novel (or in my local bar!!) but the rest left me cold.<br />An entertaining and fast read, but don't expect any depth or real suspense.	2003-03-21

It is just a mutual satiation of needs.<br />He wants a wife.<br />She wants a child.<br />Both decide to use the other to get what they want.<br />She wants to explore sexuality, he offers himself as a volunteer to 'help' her, but all he does in the end is help himself.<br />After promising he will never  hurt her or move anything forward without clear verbal signals from her, he gets angry and 'predatory' when she tried to change her mind that things have gone too far, holds her down by the wrists and body and waits until she eventually gives up struggling mentally and physically.<br />When she complains losing her virginity hurt, he says well it only hurt for a minute as if he couldn't care less.  Two black eyes is the least this character deserves. Instead she accepts her fate meekly, though she is supposed to be anything but.<br />What is with these publishing houses that think rape is acceptable as a sign of sexual chemistry and commitment???<br />In the end she 'gives' herself to him, telling him he can do whatever he likes with her body, and some rather mundane sex with her on her front bowed down with her arms up in the air like some kneeling harem slave is supposed to be his ultimate fantasy. He spends most of the rest of the other sex scenes looking at her backside so this is no real surprise, but it is pretty lame for a man who is supposed to be the king of sexual predators.<br />Plus  I really wonder how this supposedly feisty heroine  who has always quarrelled with him and is supposed to possess a great intellect/bluestocking just accepts him so readily, and becomes this mindless sex toy.<br />Most of the characters are stereotypes, esp Kitty, and the whodunit aspect is predictable. If you can't figure out who and why, well, all I can say is, you weren't paying attention!<br />After ten books, it is good to see she is throwing in the towel on this series-enough really is enough.s-enough really is enough.	2003-03-13

Gratuitous titillation in this case.<br />We have to wait until the very end of the book for even one remotely spicy love scene, and everything is so repetitive and lacking in imagination that what should be sensual ends up just silly. Them finally making love is an anti-climax (and he has already had plenty of those in the book.)<br />Even leaving that aside, there is never any real build-up of commitment which is convincing. I want to see the couple fall in love and convince me they will livel happily ever after.<br />In this instance, the supernatural elements of the book, weak as they are, only add to this impression of a lack of commitment. She acts most of the time as if she could not care less about him, making us wonder why he would even bother with such a self-centered woman.<br />Marmaduke (awful name even if historically accurate) deserves a lot better. Not that she does not have issues, having been raped by the English, but it defines who she is, narrow and weak. Not feisty at all, though we are supposed to believe being nasty to everyone constitutes strength.<br />This is the second of her books I have read. Devil in a Kilt was ok, this was a complete yawn and very repetitive.	2003-03-13

I was hoping there might be some other explanation for what was going on, like that Lionel had some sort of guilt about making love to her etc. but how this passes for a romance is beyond me. No hero would ever allow his wife to be treated so.  Rape is rape.<br />How she could then fall in love with him is ridiculous. What happened to the lovely little intelligent girl in love with Robin her step-brother in the first book in the series?<br />Grim and plodding, lots of slow bits.  Tries to be sensational but the love scenes are all so flat and she frequently repeats herself. I want a book about the magic of falling in love, even with obstacles, not the bitter cynicism of the 'heroes' she has been producing in her last few books.	2003-03-11

Tarquin is not only all that, but he is completely selfish and unable to grasp Juliana's feelings about anything.<br />She is so determined to fight him that she gets herself into ever more dangerous predicaments, and her campaign to reform the prostitutes takes up way too much time in the book which should rightfully have been spent with them getting to know each other and falling in love.<br />As for the 'love scenes' he is there for all of two seconds and then pulls out without so much as a kiss and walks off.  It is evident this author does not like writing those parts of the book, in which case let us please use our imaginations rather than be so badly let down. By the time the book is half over all the love scenes vanish anyway.<br />He is a selfish man who moves people around  like pieces on a chess board because he is wealthy and can do it.  The idea of anyone loving him because of himself, and not because he is  a Duke is totally thrown away.  And the idea of them living happily ever after just does not ring true.<br />A much better book if it were half the length as well!	2003-03-11

The author has mastered the art of fine Regency romance writing, and though the hero and heroine are both flawed, we believe their happily ever after ending.<br />He is a decent man for all of his shortcomings in the social sense, and she, whilst behaving foolishly enough to compromise herself, is not the shrew everyone thinks her to be.<br />(I didn't give this a 5 only because I think she should not have helped her family, and when she did, she should have told hubby the truth and saved everyone a lot of bother).<br />Though it would have been a lot less dramatic if she had!<br />Some really clever moments like the opera and dinner table incident and the ball and the conclusion made this book one of the best things I have read for a long time.<br />Certainly better than what a lot of established romance writers from the big houses are churning out these days.

There is some sizzle in the one real love scene, but you have to plough through several hunded pages to get there.<br />I feel sorry for Simon-he really must be the romantic idiot everyone thinks him to be to take someone like Eleanor.<br />She redeems herself slightly in the end, but not enough to make up for the cruelty and her shocking lack of feeling for anyone other than herself.

The author gets so involved with her 'noble heroine' and the worthy peasants clches that she and the hero barely exchange words. There is no witty dialogue or reparteee, any of the 'getting to know you' one would hope for before they actually do the business.<br />When they finally do 'it' at about page 200, it is little better than a near rape as she 'comforts' him when he is having one of his flashbacks as to the awful things that happened to him in the war. Then he is furious that she is a virgin and didn't mention it (not that she ever got a chance!) and tells her to get out and he will never touch her again. We get gory descriptions of the blood all over her and what a 'bloody mess' she looks, as if she is some  thing, not even a person.<br />Only when her ex shows up and wants her back does James bestir himself to admit to her he likes her  (big deal) and needs her. (selfish brute who wants to forget the war)<br />He is not a bad man, but if the book was not so seriously skewed to her playing Lady Bountiful we might get to like him more.  The whole Lord Heartless image really starts to be unconvincing after the first couple of pages, but he does seem that way as we never learn anything about his former love, or his son--he even says he had only ever loved two people in his life-his first wife and Verity. Parents?  Son? The depth of character is just not there.<br />The entire book was predictable, and the only real star was her depiction of Cornwall, which reads like something straight out of the wonderful Poldark series.<br />A highly derivative romance, with no sizzle and some very distrubing undertones, and inconsistent characters I never get to feel I care enough about.<br />I ploughed to the end of nearly 400 pages just waiting for something to heat up, but it left me (and the lovers I shouldn't wonder) cold.	2003-02-14

Well, it was average at best.<br />I liked the history and the setting, though the author really does need to do a better job of capturing life in Renaissance England. The characters were wooden and predictable, the book plot-driven only.<br />As for sizzle and sensuality, more like fizzle and not even foreplay!<br />The hero tries valiantly to like her, but Pen is not a nice person a lot of the time.  The trust between them hardly builds enough to convince us they are falling in love, and the ending of the novel really falls completely flat.<br />I know it is supposed to be part of a series, but I am most definitely not swept away by this novel enough to care about Lady Pen, let alone the first or the next book.	2003-02-04

In this novel the sweep of history is such that the characters are often mere excresences, even while one of them is supposed to be the central character. If Cot is an every woman, or every Irish taken, then we can understand all of the terrible events which weigh down the book. Less is sometimes more.  We can appreciate the passionate outrage which first provoked the author to pen this story, and the modern liberalism which got this across the editor's desk and into print, but the plight of the Irish has been done better elsewhere. The book is unrelentingly gloomy and the narrative is jarring and does not ring true. For those readers with a background in Irish or colonial studies, it is seriously flawed. There is also a difficult balance between writing for readers who know nothing, and ones who are ardent about their hobby and know far more than the author, or indeed more than many academics, as I have discovered from the exceptionally erudite amateurs I have met in my own writing career.<br />The author is to be praised for her talent and imagination, and Penguin for taking a risk on this book. They are to be criticised for not producing something more tightly constructed with more rhythm and flow, and historically accurate. Still, well done on a book that will be talked about, and thus raise awareness.	2003-01-10

The evidence of travel all over the seas by everyone from the Vikings to the Irish monks who set up monasteries thoughout Europe as far as Moscow and down through the Holy Land by the end of the 12th century is irrefutable. In one Irish bishop's grave in Norway  archaelogists have uncovered his crozier, and a jade Buddha.  We know for a fact that Viking Longships from the Shetlands and Orkneys sailed all the way down to Rome to visit with the Pope in the early 11th century, that settlements in Greenland existed in the 9th.  Therefore, the debate will rage on as to who ever 'discovered' America  for a long time to come.  This book is vastly entertaining, though, and provides much food for thought, and provides us with a wealth of fascinating information on a culture with which we should seek to be more familiar.	2003-01-10

I thought it was going to be a tightly-written thriller.  Instead I got a book that when it was amusing, was in a juvenile sort of way, and utterly lacking in suspense.  I was also appalled at the way that killing, rape and setting people on fire was dealt with as if it were amusing, when sadly, there are a lot of crimes out there comitted like sickos like that, and it is anything but funny for the families.  In fact, as I write this, I wonder at myself for being 'entertained' by stories of sick criminal types.  they certainly abound in this book, though entertained is not what I felt.  more like offended and disgusted.

Lord Garrett raises Alicia as his niece, not out of goodness but for his own sinister purpose. To keep her disabled brother safe, Alicia must consent to steal money and jewels to support Garrett and his prodigious gambling habit. Now he has arranged for Alicia to marry Lord Adam McAllister to pay off his gambling debts and ensure a future income for himself. Alicia doesn't dare refuse or she and her brother will be homeless, as will her maid Hannah, whom her brother loves. She will marry Adam, at first because he is a means of escape, and then because she loves him. Adam is attracted to Alicia, but he too has an ulterior motive for the union. The intricate plot detracts somewhat from full emotional development but this Victorian novel offers very good reading, in its not quite but almost Regency-style story.

Innocent orphan Alicia is forced into a life of crime to support her crippled brother Roger.  Falling into the hands of debauched gambler Garrett, she is raised as a lady in straight-laced Victorian society, the better to steal from the wealthy to support Garrett's addictions.  As soon as she comes of age, she is sold in marriage to wealthy Lord Adam McAllister to pay off Garrett's debts.  Adam would be the man of Alicia's dreams, but his only motive for marrying her seems to be one of revenge on Garrett and their whole family. How can Lord Adam possibly ever come to love Alicia when she is no more than a commoner and a thief?<br />Not a typical Victorian romance novel!<BR>Surviving the harsh streets of London is worse than young Alicia could have ever imagined. She and her brother Roger are left to fend for themselves upon the death of their parents. Roger, being crippled, leaves Alicia little choice but to make a living for the both of them. Little does she know that two men would forever change her life in different ways. While trying to survive the streets of London, Alicia made the grave mistake of picking the pocket of one Alfred Garrett. In turn for not having her arrested he decided to put her skills to use. He swept Alicia off the streets gave her an education then promptly utilized her skills as a thief to support his habits. Upon reaching the age of marriage he immediately made arrangements for her to marry. Adam McAllister wanted revenge on Alfred Garrett for the wrong committed against his family by the Garretts. What better way than to take something of value to the old man? Little did he know that his plan was not to be realized. Adam's mother Victoria has been mad since the death of her husband. Maude, Adam's aunt is a thief in her own right. How is a man supposed to bring about revenge when he has so many problems within his own household? Alicia, not wanting to marry anyone, seeks a way to escape. She realizes that escape is what she wants most, but she finds she can't leave her brother Roger or her maid Hannah. She agrees to the marriage on the condition that she is allowed to bring Roger and Hannah with her. And so the race begins. Will Alicia and Adam find happiness and love? What will happen to Roger and Hannah? How does Alfred Garrett survive after the wedding? Does Victoria regain her sanity? Will Maude be discovered as a true thief? All these questions can be answered by reading this fun loving, well-told story. When I sat down to read this story I thought to myself, 'Oh no another Victorian novel.' Boy was I surprised. This is not a typical Victorian novel. It is a very fun, fast paced story where the heroine was not prone to do the expected. Watching the characters unfold was a great delight. I could recommend this book as a keeper for those who like really light reading. For my personal collection I would be hard pressed to let it go. This book was very well written and the characters were easy to lfollow. --Darlene Howard	2002-05-30

She has a good friend who escorts her to various functions without wanting more. That is, until she meets her brother's good friend Zachary Regan who has his own successful architectual firm. She likes him very much, a handsome interesting man who is married--he wears a wedding ring--so she's comfortable in his presence. Until he informs her that he's a widower with three children to raise and he's never going to marry again, period. Okay, she doesn't want to get married either, so why not have a platonic friendship? <BR>The reason is that there's a fierce sexual attraction between them, and Nicole doesn't play the bedroom hopping game. And since Nicole is his best friend's sister, Zachary can't very well do anything to ruin their friendship. Besides, he's an adult, he can control himself. Sure, he can; so can she.  After a rocky start in which Nicole wants to teach Zachary a lesson, their time together becomes more and more important to each of them. She knows that she's falling in love with Zachary, and tries to break up with him, but he isn't having any of that. Nicole doesn't want her heart broken, and keeps trying to cool off their relationship, while Zachary can't keep his hands off her. She is beautiful, intelligent and what he desires most in a woman, dispite their differences in background. He was raised by his Aunt in Harlem, working hard to overcome prejudices and poverty, which Nicole was raised in an afluent family without having to struggle for success. <BR>Nicole realizes that it's too late, she's already in love with him, and believes Zachary loves her as well. Now if she could only find out why he is so adamant about marrying again. And he wants desperately to overcome his phobia about marriage... <BR>I thoroughly enjoyed this love story of full of sexual tension, likeable hero and heroine who struggle to overcome the problems keeping them apart.

All of the flaws detract from the whole reading experience, but if you are interested in a fresh, lively voice, try it.	2001-07-08

But there is no denying the power of the book, and for that I am willing to overlook its lack of structure, grammatical precision, and the fact that there is not as much info about the baboons as I would have hoped. What was there was so powerful, and the ending is not one you will easily forget.  Makes us all want to grow up to be a baboon one day....	2001-05-22

Ther heroine Riona Connolly has to move heaven and earth to save her family and win the man she loves.  The dark forces at work against her in the form of Lucien's ex-fiance, and a horrible doctor who works with him, nearly cost her everything.  Lucien is an admirable hero, married to his work, hide-bound by society's expectations of him. He is an honorable and decent man, if a bit traditional, and terrified of falling in love.  The last thing he ever imagines is that he will fall for with a young woman from the wilds of Donegal.  The magic between them is felt by both, resisted by both, but in the end it brings them together, for the force of their destiny cannot be denied.  Both bring out the best in each other, in the worst of times. Both show true courage and decency, and the passion which shimmers between them nearly scorches the pages!  But don't worry, nothing crude here; the love scenes are really beautifully done. A wonderful cast of supporting characters as real to me as my own family and friends, and gorgeous descriptions of their travels in Ireland, make this book well worth reading.	2001-04-16

The characters Emer and Dalton were so wonderful, but went through so many problems, I was not sure that she could pull off the happy eaver after ending.  Well, I was thrilled to find that in addition to the romance there was also a great deal of excitement and adventure.  If ever a couple deserve to be together, it is this pair.
