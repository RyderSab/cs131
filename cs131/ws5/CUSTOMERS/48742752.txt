I've always been interested in cars, and for a while I earned a living writing about cars for a magazine. My shots were OK but not as good as they should have been. How I wish I could have read this book back then!<br /><br />James Mann's book gives you information on equipment, basic techniques, tips on preparing the car (detail first, and be sure to remove all stickers!), advanced techniques (check out the cover photo ... want to know how to do that?), motorsports events, groups, people, studio techniques and finally tips on doing a magazine feature.<br /><br />Every person who is involved in a job which even remotely involves photographing cars (Media people, Advertising, Marketing, etc.) should read this book!	2005-05-14

Worth having if you're a Ducati fan.	2005-03-14

As a Laverda owner (1997 Diamante), I feel there has been little written about these amazing bikes. They are Italian, have exotic components, but aren't Ducatis! Mick Walker covers the subject matter well in about 172 pages, but I would have liked to see more information about the Zane bikes. Perhaps a separate book on Zane bikes alone would be worth considering. If you own one, better grab a copy of this book while they're still available.	2005-03-14

Kid Rock gets his own softail WCC bike built at about the same time at Jesse's place and the two set off on a road trip to Mexico. That's about it. Lots of cool pictures which you'll like if you're into choppers and the whole Jesse James/WCC thing. Only problem with this book is that it has ALL the text right at the beginning followed by ALL the pics. A little frustrating having to read and then flip forward to look at the pics which were referred to in the text earlier. Other than that it's not really as interesting to read as \\"I am Jesse James\\", IMHO. Still, worth checking out if you're a fan.	2004-12-19

Not many of us who are car crazy will ever have a garage like the ones in the book but then again, something normal wouldn't be inspirational. There are slightly less exotic garages also included in the book but millionaire garage or not, all of them house historic, exciting automobiles and motorcycles and are an inspiration to all of us who aspire be the best at what we do with our much loved motorised possessions.	2004-12-19

This book is just pure eye candy. Considering that bike magazines are so expensive this book is worth buying for inspiration. As a 'coffee table book' (whatever that means!), it serves its purpose well, which is why I'm giving it 5 Stars.<br /><br />I'm not really into custom Harleys (As far as H-Ds are concerned I would prefer a Buell X1 Lightning or Sundance Performance Super XR1200) but I appreciate the effort, skill and craftsmanship that goes into each of his bikes. Jesse James is famous because he's the real deal. He can actually do his own metalwork, shaping sheetmetal into a tank or fender, and does his own welding. His style is a bit on the extreme side of things, yet isn't bizzare or cartoonish, which is probably why he's successful.<br /><br />I bought this book because I wanted to know ... \\"Who is this guy?\\" ... \\"Why is he so famous\\"? I've created a couple of special edition automobiles ... but why am I not even half as famous? :) We could all learn a bit about marketing, advertising and promotion from Jesse James. If you want to read about Jesse James himself, buy the Mike Seate book \\"Jesse James, the man and his machines\\".	2004-07-20

This is a basic black &amp; white book, similar to those model guidebooks with some shots that show detail, and some info on the car, and Jim Hall.<br />Worth getting if you're really, really interested in Chaparrals, or mid engine racecars. I was hoping for some info on how they built these cars, but there is not much info on the actual manufacturing process. No blueprints or plans either, which is why I'm giving it only 4 stars.<br />I don't really regret buying it, but I was expecting more. (Expecting too much, perhaps).<br />Might be inspirational for those who are considering building their own mid engine racecar!	2003-01-22

Buy this book then. A lot of good info for beginners and even people with a lot more experience. If you know all about engines, camshafts, etc., then this book will not be a good buy. Personally, I think it didn't have enough info on Honda engines, so I hope Mr. Edgar will write 21st Century Performance Part 2.	2002-07-31

There are colour pictures of carburizing, neutral and oxidizing flames which I had always found confusing.<br />The painting section has useful information on paints, safety and common paint defects.<br />A very useful short series of photos is included on how to build a 'copy' mould for fibreglass parts.<br />The book is short but contains condensed information on almost everything a person restoring or painting a car will run into. Obviously, when you strip down a car for painting you will notice all the rusted areas and you will have to deal with them.<br />There are lots of good books out there with more detail on painting, welding and composites but I don't regret getting this book as I refer to it often. If you're just starting and need basic information for your project then this is a good buy but remember this is NOT a metalworking book. It won't teach you how to use an English wheel or weld aluminium if thats what you're after. There is information on these subjects in other books.	2001-06-08

When my welding equipment finally arrived my father decided to get this book to help us with our restoration. In my case the front end of my car had been smashed by a previous owner and getting the original shape back would be almost impossible with my bodyworking skills. The book shows how to do this although I would really prefer more close up pics of EXACTLY how the front can be cut off carefully in order to preserve it. Sometimes you can buy a used Mini and chop off the front for less than it would cost to buy repair panels. This is especially true in countries far away from the UK where it is much easier and cost effective to buy brand new Rover replacement panels.<br />The photography is all in black and white and if you're familiar with Porters books this shouldn't come as a surprise. This might be a little dissapointing as these days there are websites where people post full colour, detailed pictures of their restoration projects. I may be mistaken but I believe this book was written in the 80s.<br />One dissapointment to me was the fact that there was no information on completely replacing the floorboards. The paint and upholstery scheme charts only go up to 1969 which was unfortunate since my car is a 1975 model Mini 1000.<br />It is not a book on metalworking but it would be nice to have sections on how to build floorboards from scratch. The Mini floorboards are not very complicated compared to newer cars and I believe this is something that a lot of hobbyists can do.<br />It would be good to have Porters bodyworking book, or the Richard Finch book on welding to aid you in your restoration if you're going to do it yourself. For engine repairs the two Haynes books on Minis would be good. If you're going to do any performance modifications then David Vizard's book on A-series engines is a must-have.<br />In conclusion I would recommend this book to beginners who want to restore their Minis but they should also get the relevant service manuals, bodywork and welding books. Experienced Mini enthusiasts might be dissapointed. 10 years ago, I thought the Porter book on VW Beetle restoration was excellent but when I read it now, after years of reading magazines, watching friends cars being restored and looking at websites, I don't have the same enthusiasm I had for his book as I did earlier but I still think his writing is good and very relevant as a guide to restoration efforts for beginners and even people with experience.eir Minis but they should also get the relevant service manuals, bodywork and welding books.

It covers types of discs, production, materials, pad materials, etc. There are also chapters on testing, maintenence and a cause and effect section with failed discs and the reasons why failures happen. There are colour photos of brake failures, abnormal wear, stress, heat and graphs help to explain heat, runout, noise, proliferation of cracks, vapour lock, fading and more. At 128 pages it seemed a little too short to me, but then again it was based on a 25 page booklet originally published by Brembo. The information was good but its more for academic interest. If you're interested in putting this knowledge to work it would be better if you were an automotive student or a writer. For routine servicing and maintenance your car's service manual should have all the information you need. The information is however very interesting. I was looking at it before buying it and was very tempted to add this to my collection of automotive books. Not least of the factors which tempted me was the fact that it was written in collaboration with Brembo, one of the worlds leading brake manufacturers. If you need in-depth scientific information on disc brakes then maybe you should take a look at this book. For more practical information I've heard that Fred Puhn's brake book is a good buy. Maybe both of these books will serve as a useful tool for sportscar design considerations.	2001-05-02

Every step has pictures and clear instructions for you to follow. Very expensive. Buy this only if you are totally obsessed with VW maintenance. A lot of the special factory tools are almost impossible to find and this dissapointed me quite a bit. As it does not cover later engines, transmissions, etc. it would be helpful to have other manuals and books to help you with your VW restoration. Books I would recommend are the later VW model service manuals by Bentley and Haynes and the How To Rebuild book by Tom Wilson. If you want to tune your VW there is Bill Fishers How to Hotrod book which is ancient (1971) but still very relevant to tuning aircooled VWs. If in doubt you can participate in online VW forums and ask questions. It took me 6 months to rebuild my VW motor following instructions in this book and other service manuals (Haynes, Autobooks). 5 of those 6 months were for research and getting all the necessary tools ready. Only about 1 months work on weekends and friday nights to rebuild a 1585cc dual port VW motor for my brother's 1965 Beetle.	2001-02-22

Bill Fisher's book is what most VW fans start out with. It may be outdated (written in 1971 I believe). The current printing has no updates and lists some catalogues as being 50 cents. The information is what most people will find interesting. Once you understand what Bill is talking about you can learn more by participating in online VW forums like the Cal-Look Forum on the net.

Books	5	38	38	N	N	An excellent outline on how to build a Seven replica	What a concept! Building your own car! With this book Ron Champion outlines a plan for building your own Lotus Seven/Westfield clone. Some sections may be not as detailed as some people would prefer but overall it is excellent and informative. There are lots of builders and discussion groups that readers could join and learn from. The most valuable part of this book, in my opinion, is how to build the frame. The frame is built from square section steel tubing and welding equipment is required. Parts like the nosecone, windscreen, etc. can be fabricated or bought. There are quite a few Seven clone manufacturers around the world. The 'for as little as..' part may be a slightly incorrect but its much cheaper than most kit cars. In the course of building this car the reader will have to learn a lot about suspensions, drivetrain and engine rebuilding, fibreglass work, etc. It's almost like an outline for a course in Motor Vehicle Technology! I must say that this is one of the best car books I have ever read and if you've ever had schoolboy dreams of building your own roadster type car then you've definitely got to get this book!	2000-12-09

This is a book which is not only useful for its historical value but also for the constructional articles inside. Many of the circuits are very similar to those found in classic valve amp brands like Leak, Quad, Radford, etc. As it is a reprint of an old book some of the components may not be easily available, especially output transformers, switches and capacitors. Theoretical information is kept to a minimum and is very useful. This is a book for constructors who really want to build their own amp. The is an excellent stereo preamp design and 20, 10 and 3 Watt mono amp designs. Designs for 7 and 3 Watt stereo preamps are also included. There are chapters on sources of distortion, hi fidelity amplification, construction and assembly.	2000-11-15

Most of the photos are black and white with a center section in colour. There is one factory drawing of a front 'stoneguard' and many uninformed readers will be surprised to learn of the successes of VW Beetles and derivitives in rallies and other motorsport competitions.

The book covers equipment, modifications to valves, guides and seats, port shapes, head machining operations, CR calculation, chamber balancing and reshaping methods. Other useful information on port and combustion chamber design, valve sizes, springs and spark plugs is also included. A useful appendix has chamber shapes for various British cars.

This book is intended primarily for motorcyclist but almost any enthusiast who likes cars and bikes will enjoy reading it. The book covers chassis, tyres, suspension, brakes and development. Most of the information here is theoretical but beginners would probably find it very useful. There are lots of useful formulas, (e.g. how to drill brake discs properly). It ends with some useful programs written in BASIC which is quite dated since everyone is using C++ these days. I refer to this book and its companion book on 4 stroke engine tuning regularly for information and would feel lost without them. Don't expect a lot of nuts-and-bolts info, however, it's mostly theoretical, but VERY useful.	2000-11-07

I am not a die hard Ferrari fan but I bought this book mainly because of its full colour photos. Laban includes little known facts (to me at least!) about Ferrari's handling of customers and his ideas for cars. The 166 roadster and the 250GT SWB are probably my favourite Ferrari's and there are some 2+2 models here that I have never seen before. As for technical information and photographs of engine and suspension details, Laban does not elaborate as much as I would have liked and this is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of five. My only complaint is that I would like to see how the cars were constructed. If you're looking for detailed technical information and how the cars were constructed then this probably isn't the book for you.
