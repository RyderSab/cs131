US	51975314	RF6MO5LFA6LMR	1400062314	9571448	Prep: A Novel	Books	4	6	7	N	N	I liked it.	Yes, the protagonist was unlikeable.  But aren't most teenagers?  Aren't most teenagers eager to be popular, attractive and sucessful?  Aren't most teenagers lazy with a sense of entitlement?  Aren't most teenagers unexceptional?   <br /> <br />Lee wants to be special, but she's not.  She's not pretty, not brilliant, not a good athlete, not rich.  So she's pretty much O for four in her version of the world.  For some reason she's put herself in an environment where she's even less special (relatively) and she's stuck dealing with the consequences.  Most of her whining is internal, so I can't fault her too much for that.  There are a few references to her being \\"special\\" and occasionally she seems witty.  I suspect the author relates strongly to her and maybe forgot to include some concrete examples of Lee's spark because she's either still exceptionally insecure or she didn't want to seem like she was bragging?  Also - since the character of Lee narrates the book, maybe it would be out of character for insecure Lee to toot her own horn? <br /> <br />It was very entertaining, but I agree with the reviews that comment on Lee's lack of appeal.	2005-06-22
US	51975314	R2T0MUQPCVCSYZ	0066214130	57180289	State of Fear	Books	2	12	24	N	N	hmmm...	As a fictional thriller I thought State of Fear was not up to snuff.   Enough about that.  As a commentary on the environmental movement I found it condescending and hypocritical.  I started this book already in largely in agreement with the author on environmental issues, although I'm sure he has done much more research and is more knowledgeable than me.  But I find it manipulative, heavy handed and even \\"unfair\\" to use a fictional story to point out the weak points in the positions of those you disagree with.  That approach gives too much leeway to pick and choose what info you want to emphasize and what you want to leave out.  The portrayal of \\"environmentalists\\" was cruel and reminded me of the Dick Cheney character in Day After Tomorrow.  It's not fair to use fictional character assasination of your opponents to make a point.  Unless you are writing a fictional book - and Crichton seems to want to use the guise of \\"fiction\\" to excuse himself.  And while I agree that the media fear-mongers and is irresponsible in it's science reporting, it's not any more ethical to use one's celebrity to promote a fictional book that by it's nature is not subject to formal peer review that promotes a contrary agenda.  *That* reminds me of Tim Robbin's ridiculous Oscar speech several years ago.  I guess I'm dissapointed that Mr. Creighton didn't do the work to write a non-fiction book on the topic.	2005-01-04

And I got the feeling that he reflects the author's perspective.  I'm no shrink, but there's something seriously wrong with ALL the women in this book, but what's stranger is the way their inexcusable behavior is excused by both the author and Frank.  I actually found the cuckolded husband (who was supposed to be the \\"bad guy\\") to be the most normal character.  The part about Frank supposedly being a alcoholic, but apparently having no trouble drinking in moderation was odd too.  The hostility towards financially successful men was distracting as well.  I would imagine that Keith Ablow makes plenty of money off his novels.  He should get over it already.	2004-12-02

I think the book accurately represents college life in the sense that most of the incidents are believable.  But the book is very misrepresentative in the way drunken, lewd behavior is described over and over, to the exclusion of much else.   However, the big problem is Charlotte herself.  I don't see how she can be considered a stereotype or archetype (unlike her 'boyfriends' - the frat boy, the nerd, and the jock).  She's a precocious nerd, but she's also a pretty, social-climbing user AND a naive, backwards hillbilly.  Not to mention a judgemental [...] with a highly developed sense of entitlement (apparently everyone is supposed to pay attention to her on her terms, but she is under no obligation to make any effort to reciprocate).  That's just too many things, and they are innately contradictory.  A social climber, especially an intelligent one, would not be that naive and backwards.  She would have seen a Cosmo before.  She would know not to wear keds and high-waisted denim shorts.  There were other things that didn't ring true.  Enough of them that I had to wonder where the editor was.  No girl, no matter how clueless, borrows a dress for a social event and doesn't try it on beforehand.  And well into the book it's revealed that Charlotte took some college classes at Appalacian State as a high school student.  So she's ALREADY BEEN TO COLLEGE.  huh?  And while ASU is certainly not Ivy League it is located in a mountain resort area frequented by affluent people (even bankers!).   Why even put that in there?   How is it that her dad is talented enough to can build a computer (practically from scratch!), but can't make himself employable?  I could go on, but you get the picture.  Wolfe's talent makes the book very enjoyable for the first half, but after that Charlotte really begins to grate.	2004-12-02

To be honest, I'm not literary enough to comment on the book's strengths.  But I did want to comment on some of the criticisms in the Amazon reviews.  Namely, that (1) the book is a novel, NOT a dissertation on teen mass murderers and (2) an unlikeable protagonist does not automatically mean the book isn't any good.  Eva's failings are part of what makes the story so haunting.   <br /> <br />I agree, that it distracted from the realism of the story that Kevin's problems were not addressed more aggressively by his parents, but his mother's negative, judgemental version of events had the benefit of hindsight.  There really aren't that many SPECIFIC instances of obviously deviant behavior (although there are some).  And in one case, Kevin is vindicated and his mother is shown to have judged him too harshly.	2004-11-12

This was a very entertaining book and I had a good time reading it.  I think what keeps it from being a great book is the author's failure to concentrate on either a literary, highbrow commentary on society and science OR an engaging adventurous sci-fi tale.<br />If she'd chosen the first route, she could have made her points without the simplistic, recycled, over-the-top science mumbo-jumbo which is clearly not her forte anyway (in the Handmaid's Tale the &quot;science&quot; behind the infertility epidemic was left appropriately vague).<br />If she'd chosen to go for an all-out apocalyptic anti-fairy tale she could have devoted more effort to making her world of the future more believable and Snowman's attempts at survival more credible (why is this guy living among dangerous animals unarmed and wearing a sheet that constantly falls off?  Everyone else is dead there's not an extra pair of pants and a weapon lying around?)  Even a potentially suicidal character would at least attend more diligently to their physical comfort.  More interesting details would have upped the entertainment factor even more.<br />Of course, there's no reason why a book can't be both, but Oryx and Crake doesn't quite make it.  Sure comes close though and I would recommend it.	2004-05-08

But after reading reviews for both books on Amazon I had top admit that Doomsday had some of the same flaws (most notably incredibly stupid, ineffective one-dimensional characters), to a much lessor degree.  I also found the book to be incredibly boring.  The pace of information-gathering is soooo slow that I started to forget what had already been revealed.  It started to seem like I was reading a description of the same incident over and over.  The eceptionally crude, black and white characterizations became increasingly difficult to stomach as the book wore on.  OK, you don't like Dr. Mandrake.  Can we forget about him now Joanna and stop acting like a third-grader running from a cooties victim?  Unlike everyone else in the book Maisie, the sick girl, is amusing so it's hard to understand why the protagonists who are supposedly rooting for her expend so much energy avoiding her.  Ultimately I felt the &quot;answer&quot; revealed toward the end was somewhat poignant, esp. in light of 9/11.   I actually figured that that was where she had gotten the idea and checked the publication date.  There was obviously a great deal of thought and care that went into the book, but nothing could redeem this book from the boring pace and unappealing characters.   But Wills does deserve credit for coming up with an interesting idea.  I just wish she would have presented it better.	2004-02-11

She has to overstate her case even though she has to know she didn't really prove it.  She wants to make money off her name, and a scholarly discourse on one suspect isn't what her readers are interested in.  I do agree that the chonology is very confusing and given that people with a lot of knowledge about the ripper case aren't going to like her book that much, it would have been a good idea to provide a summary of the murders and the other theories early in the book.  Her failure to pursue things that might weaken her case is a little irritating and distracting too.  For instance when she tries to link other murders to the ripper/Sickert.  OK there was a brutal murder when Sickert was in town.  Well, how many brutal murders were there the week before when he wasn't in town?  Put it in context!	2003-12-07

The two \\"research studies\\" he refers to are his extremely informal one with only about 50 subjects and another vaguely described one by Stephen Camarata with about 250 subjects.  The point of this book is that there appears to be a subset of late-talkers with above-average math and/or mechanical and/or musical abilities and they are usually boys.  Sowell objects to how these children are frequently labeled with \\"disorders,\\" especially autism.  I don't know much about this, but it was my understanding that autism is a wide-spectrum disorder and nothing in this book proved to me that many of these \\"late-talking\\" children Sowell writes about aren't simply borderline cases.  It wasn't very reassuring to me - the very mathmatical mother of a bright but speech delayed 23 month-old.  But Sowell admits that he is not an expert in this field and it seems that he has collected, analyzed and presented more information about this group of children than anyone else.  But what I found objectionable about the book was his hostility towards teachers, speech therapists, and the like.  I'm sure some are good and some are lousy, but to describe them as \\"semi-professionals\\" suggests to me an extremely biased mindset.  He also takes quotes from parents who disagree with him that he finds on the internet and tears them apart.  One in particular was from a mother who explained that she didn't want her son to just be good in math.  She wanted him to enjoy drama, peotry and liturature.  Seems reasonable to me, but Sollow apparently can't tolerate any suggestion that these children might have shortcomings, however minor.  This attitude might be more understandable if he extended his tolerance of different aptitudes to other categories of children.  But he describes a child with an I.Q. of 98 as being two points below normal!  Overall, it was worth reading and I give Sollow credit for tackling the topic.  But I hope more information about this cluster of abilities/delays becomes available.e Sollow credit for tackling the topic.

I was in a rush and thought it was about 'How to talk so kids can learn...TO TALK.'  So as the non-educator mother of a 13 month-old, my opinion may not be the most valuable.  However, I did find the book to be a little wishy-washy.  Of course its better to open a dialogue rather than to lecture, but does an adult have the obligation to walk on eggshells when responding to poor behavior on the part of a child?  And while I can see why gratuitous punishment might not work well, the advice to never punish seemed off base to me.  It could easily be interpreted as 'never force a child to face the negative consequences of their actions.'  I just don't think that works with kids.  But, like I said, I'm not a teacher.  It does seem like some of the advice in the book might create a better classroom environment in the long run.	2002-04-14

Way too many, way too easy 'clues' were sprinkled throughout the  story.<br />Also - it would have been more interesting if the author had spent  some more time developing the idea of another hidden culture, the science  behind the story, and filling in some of the holes in the story's logic.  Although maybe that's not a fair criticism if this book is a &quot;mystery  thriller&quot; and not sci-fi.<br />Finally...I thought the very end was  really stupid.

Ms. Reiss does not specify which 'studies' she is picking and choosing from, and she seems to lack the acedamic background to evalute their validity.  I'm not saying she doesn't know nutrition, but I think  she's in way, way over her head when it comes to interpreting controversial  findings and anecdotal evidence.  In other words, I don't think she's  qualified to separate the good from the bad when it comes to scientific  findings.<br />Another disturbing aspect of this book is her use of very, very  vague adjectives to describe food quantities, i.e. &quot;Eat plently, but  not too much.&quot;  Gee...that helps.  There are NO specific  recommendations in the book as to the amount of the recommended nutrients a  person should consume!  She doesn't quantify ANYTHING!  She does provide  recipes (half the book is recipes, so if you think you are getting 272  pages of dense nutritional advice, think again), but no integrated  recommended daily menus.  It would be impossible to put together a  nutritionally balanced diet using only this book, except through sheer  luck.<br />Perhaps the single most disturbing thing is Ms. Reiss' failure to  adequately stress the importance of folic acid in the weeks leading up to  conception.  She does mention it, but fails to recommend supplements or  suggest a SPECIFIC, QUANTIFIED regime of whole foods that would ensure an  adequate supply of folic acid.  <br />If you plan to buy many books, and read  them all, by all means read this book to get some additional theories about  fertility and nutrition to choose from.  Even though I think the book  stinks compared to others, to me, it was worth the dead presidents just to learn that  ginger might cause miscarriages.  But TAKE ANYTHING IN THIS BOOK WITH A  GRAIN OF SALT.  And if you do decide to follow it wholeheartedly, please  run your daily menus through some nutrition analysing software to make sure  you are getting appropriate quatities of nutrients.	1999-12-10
