I kept reading it only in the misguided hope that it would get more interesting.  It has an unlikeable and annoying main character.

I thought Books 4 and 5 were the sucky ones.  I was relieved to have Book 6 come along and be filled with action.  I felt it went much faster than Books 4 and 5.  For those of you saying this book was just \\"filler\\" until book 7 comes out...well, DUH, of course it is, I mean, JKR said there would be 7 books all along, so what makes you think there would be some spectacular climax in Book 6?  Personally I appreciated Snape turning out to be the bad guy, and although unfortunate that he died, I think that JKR tries to expose a fact of life - people can be mistaken about other people, and his death showed some of Dumbledore's humanness.  He wanted to believe the best in everybody, but unfortunately, everyone isn't good and doesn't deserve a second chance.   <br /> <br />The reason I give the book 4 stars instead of 5 is that I agree with other reviewers - I don't know how Harry will ever defeat Voldemort because he clearly isn't that smart or gifted; he's primarily lucky and somewhat stupid.  I actually hope JKR kills him off in the end because it would be a refreshing and memorable change to see a series have the bad guy win in the end, ala \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\"   <br /> <br />Oh, and what was the point of bringing up the idea that Neville could have been the chosen one in book 5?  In this book JKR points out that prophesies don't always have to come true, so perhaps Neville will kill off both Harry and Voldy for us.	2005-08-20

It tells some tips that others leave out, such as:  an easy way to remember what time it is when using 24 hour time - just subtract 12!  For example, 23:30 would be 23-12 = 11:30 American time!  Also, regarding shows in London - Steves suggested booking directly through the website of the show and not through a ticket broker.  One website I was planning on booking opera tix through wanted $120/ticket...same tickets, direct, were 45 Euros...good savings tip!<br />I was very disappointed, however, that he did not consider Greece good enough to make it in the &quot;best of&quot; guide.

Hmmmm.<br />I grew up in rural North Carolina and Georgia around all the sorts of people and job situations that the author investigated.<br />She wouldn't last a month if she were really in this sort of situation.<br />As other readers said before, she totally relied on previous money...but her main &quot;shield&quot; to me was that she knew it was all TEMPORARY.  She never faced the dispair of never really having money and not knowing how long such a situation would last.<br />I did appreciate her enlightening the plight of the workers and the housing conditions, but she herself annoyed the heck out of me.  Whining, moaning and groaning about basic work (having been a waitress myself - get over it sister) and being all hoity toity about the jobs that she would even interview for (I mean, hel-lo, if she was truly homeless and out of $$ I don't think she would have been so picky) - it got a little old.<br />But I do think it was a definitely good, although upper-class and social-class prejudiced, read.	2003-11-09

I am getting married in 99 days (yes, I know the number), and this book was just what I needed.  It profiles the neuroses that plague brides-to-be everywhere, such as searching for the perfect wedding-day shoes, dealing with coworkers who JUST DON'T SEEM TO REALIZE THAT YOUR WEDDING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN WORK, and caterers who are high on drugs.  The author struggles as to whether or not she should wear her mother's wedding dress...it IS hideously ugly, but maybe it can be remade?

This may be somewhat of an unpopular opinion, but I encourage you to read it all the way through before &quot;bashing&quot; me for only giving it three stars when it averages a &quot;5.&quot;<br />Ok, so what plot does this sound like?  5 travellers (3 male, one female, one animal) set off to the middle of a fantasy land, seeking its mysterious ruler who has never been seen?  Nope, forget Dorothy and the Tin Man.  What Julie Andrews has basically done with this story is copy the Wizard of Oz in a far less original manner.<br />There are weird, freaky characters with bizarre, over-the-top names.  There are dangers along the way, with someone (in this case the Prock) determined to stop them from reaching the castle (Wicked Witch, anyone?).<br />And the book is quite predictable.  We all knew full well that they would all find the Whangdoodle in the end, because gosh darnit, this was such a pure and sweet story that its readers just can't handle a sad ending.  We all knew that the High-Behind cat that visited Lindy was up to no good.  I am normally terrible at predicting what can happen in books, and yet this novel, which encourages readers to &quot;use their imaginations&quot; left little to it as far as the plot.<br />Another thing that annoyed me was the obvious &quot;morals lessons&quot; that were prevelent throughout the story.  Other children's books, such as Harry Potter, slyly weave morality throughout without force-feeding it to kids.  No kid wants to hear the Professor give a speech about how, &quot;Sometimes our greed gets the best of us and we do things that aren't always right.&quot;  It was also full of 50's-style &quot;father knows best&quot; mentality (whether when the kids were all gathered around in the family room with mom and dad, looking up words in the dictionary, or when the professor insisted that they always do what he said without questioning).  Granted, this book was published almost 30 years ago, but good grief.<br />I would have also liked the book better if the three children weren't such boring, predictable little puppets.  Get some spirit already, and stop being such goody-goodys!!<br />Mrs. Andrews did do a good job of not &quot;over-describing&quot; the characters in order that readers might come up with their own mental descriptions.<br />As much as I have pointed out the shortcomings in this book, it is still a quick, fairly interesting read.  Just don't expect spectacular originality or plot twists.d the book better if the three children weren't such boring, predictable little puppets.

Well...let's see...this book is very well-written.  The author is obviously widely-read and has a master command on the English language.  On the other hand, the book was full of so many obscure references (i.e. Salman Rushdie and the fatwa, all kinds of random artists, etc.) that if you are not as &quot;literate&quot; as Brauner (which very few of us are), then you can get lost in some of his analogies. <br />He's kind of like the Dennis Miller of literature with his random references.  I consider myself fairly well-read, but in order to really &quot;get&quot; this book one must be a master of history, art, and philosophy as well.<br />With all that aside, the quirky insights into human life were very amusing.  For example, he snacks at a &quot;hip&quot; coffee house where the employees provide terrible service, for to actually acknowledge the patrons' existance and/or hustle with their orders would be beneath them.  Also, Ronnie, the main character, has a way of discussing things candidly, though they may be politically incorrect and controversial.<br />I realize this book is primarily a love story and about how Ronnie doesn't really appreciate 'Sherpa,' aka Karen, his girlfriend.  I think, however, that the author missed the point.  Sure, Karen was a great girl, but why was everyone trying to make Ronnie see that she was perfect for him when really she wasn't?  She wasn't his intellectual equal, which was a very important quality to Ronnie, and they had nothing to talk about, nothing in common, except sex.  Ronnie admittedly attended her protests for the prospect of getting in her pants.  <br />I felt that Ronnie needed someone more of a thinker, such as his sister (except for that whole being-related part), to date and find happiness...and I felt that Karen needed someone more artsy, passionate and emotional.<br />A book that makes you think, but can get a bit overanalytical.  I'd recommend getting it from the public library rather than spending the $13.	2001-01-24

I have read only two of Oprah's books so far, and this one is far better than the first (Deep End of the Ocean).<br />It was definitely interesting, in the sort of way that people want to view car wrecks.  I had a hard time identifying with Delores, the main character, at points because a) she refused to help herself and b) she went through so many bizarre life experiences.  So I can not say how I would react to many of the situations that she experienced, but I can say that I wanted to reach inside the book, give her a good slap, and scream, &quot;Do something!  Anything!&quot; <br />But the best characters aren't always likeable (look at Scarlett O'Hara).  Lamb crafted a book that piqued and held my interest until the very end and helped to show many of the mistakes that women make in the name of supposed &quot;love,&quot; &quot;friendship,&quot; and family ties.<br />Definitely worth a read, but be warned - it is depressing at points.	2001-01-23

The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it could have been a little more descriptive, and at some points, the plot fell together just a little too neatly.<br />Otherwise, though, it's very interesting.  Stanley Yelnats must go to a detention camp to serve a punishment for a crime he didn't commit.  He must endure the idiosyncracies of his fellow &quot;campers&quot; and wardens in order that he may survive.  But most importantly (in my humble opinion) he forges a friendship with &quot;Zero,&quot; a camper who has never been or done anything worthy or useful - at least to ordinary observers.<br />This is a beautiful tale of human frailty, prejudice, friendship, trust and of promises broken and redeemed.  Definitely worth a read, no matter what your age (I am 23).	2001-01-23

First off, let me say that this book really held my interest and I enjoyed it (I gave it four stars, didn't I?).<br />Perhaps, though, I should not have read &quot;A Man in Full&quot; first.  There are so many similarities between the two books that I found myself thinking that Wolfe re-wrote &quot;Bonfire&quot; to make &quot;Man,&quot; yet based it in Atlanta instead of New York.<br />Let's see...both books had racial tensions, both concerned lawyers that only looked out for their own interests, both had a strong main character that eventually fell in the end, both involved a lot (and I do mean a lot) of spouse-cheating, both had political figures that were determined to get re-elected at any cost, both had characters that were oh-so-concerned with thrusting out their mighty muscles to impress the women...etc. etc. etc.<br />A previous reviewer stated that she didn't understand why people did not like the protagonist, Sherman McCoy.  Let's see...hmmm...he cheats on his wife, repeatedly...he's a jerk to his fellow co-workers...he has no thought to what the consequences of his actions could do to his young daughter...in short, he generally thinks with the, er, &quot;contents&quot; of his pants.  Granted, Wolfe writes in such a way that you do feel sorry for Sherman at the end, but I think it's important to remember that if he hadn't been cheating on his wife with Maria, then he never would have hit anyone with his car and the whole situation would have been avoided (although granted that would have made for a much less interesting book).<br />All in all, though, even if &quot;Man&quot; and &quot;Bonfire&quot; are similar, one cannot overlook the original genious of &quot;Bonfire.&quot;  Wolfe's descriptives of different types of people (the &quot;Pimp Roll,&quot; for God's sake, to describe how someone walked) and the vicious observations he makes on society and its shortcomings (and believe me, no one is exempt, not even authors) aid in the creation of an intricately woven piece of literature.	2001-01-23

Sigh...guess I'm getting a bit mushy in my mid-twenties.  =)  This book, although a bit cliched, shows the strength of a woman who must deal with a man that is stuck in his own past.  <br />An earlier reviewer said that the herione of the story was &quot;stupid&quot; for leaving Garrett because he could not get over Catherine; I disagree.  That was my favorite part of the book.  Women everywhere have to make difficult decisions that show clearly they are not responsible for their men's emotional hazards.  Rather than hang on to Garrett and hope that he would change, Theresa chose to control her own destiny and provide a form of finality, closure.<br />Of course Garrett recognizes his shortcomings in the end, but would he have really changed had they gotten back together?  It is all well and good for him to say that he was going to change, but the reader never gets to see if he would or not.  This, I think, allowed Theresa to have a happy memory of their relationship rather than a bitter one.<br />Well worth a read - just bring the hanky.	2001-01-08

This book is quite a jewel.  I am a Southerner, born and bred, and yet I can laugh at myself as well as the next person.  Each culture has its own idiosyncracies, and this book explores the unsaid rules of the South that slyly keep outsiders at arm's reach.  For example, how was Princess Margaret to know that ladies didn't smoke, chew gum in public, or wear white shoes after Labor Day?  I certainly am not the extremist pictured in the book, but I did attend the University of Georgia and rushed a sorority, and got to witness girls talking about being in the New Orleans Day parades, and attending the Old South ball, and yes, I was a baton twirler (although according to the book, that would never win you Miss America).  It very accurately personifies a particular eschelon of Old South behavior that still exists, and makes some of it seem as rediculous as it really is.  Definitely worth a read!!	2000-12-05

Ellen Conford had such a way of identifying with her readers. <br />In this book, the protagonist finds a lamp, which of course, when she rubs it, produces a genie that grants her every desire.  Or so she thinks.  For example, when she wishes for the &quot;perfect man,&quot; a guy suddenly pops up in her bedroom, bearing flowers in hand.<br />So saddened am I by the gradual disappearance of my childhood books such as this that I am going to try to track them all down and buy them for my future children.

If you look closely at the Harry Potter series of books, you will see that books 1-4 get progressively thicker.

I had to read this book twice to decide whether or not to give it 4 or 5 stars.  In fact, the first time I read it, I was in such a hurry to find out what happened, I missed much of the intricate detail that Feilding  weaves into this book.  Upon my second reading, however, I knew this book  had to get the full 5.<br />&quot;Edge of Reason&quot; has a greater depth  than &quot;B.J.&quot; but it equally as witty and funny.  Perhaps not the  most, er, realistic of plots, but it's just close enough to real life to  make readers identify with Bridge's mishaps.  I was practically rolling on  the floor at Bridge's Christmas cards that she sent, her plots to outwit  the Evil Jellyfish Rebecca, and her attempt to find the perfect man with  &quot;long eyelashes&quot; through the personal ads.  On a positive note,  though, this book made me think more so than the first one.  It explored a  few more serious issues, though always in a tongue-in-cheek way, and showed  how miscommunication in a relationship can make things much more difficult  than they have to be.<br />My main complaint about this episode - what the  heck happened to Tom?  I miss him!  He is just a side note to this book,  making him seem less of a crucial friend to Bridge and a whole lot more  superficial/insensitive.<br />Overall, however, this book neatly finishes a  lot of loose ends from the first installment.  There is somewhat of a  cliffhanger ending, which leaves B.J. fans certainly hoping that Fielding  will write another book, and leave it at a trilogy.  <br />A survival guide  for women everywhere who are desperately clinging to their sanity!   Fabulous!	2000-06-01

This book was quite entertaining and definitely held my interest, enough to prompt me to read its two sequals and eagerly await the third.<br />Rowling has quite the imagination and has a way with names; however, I did get confused initially with all the names that began with the letter  &quot;H!&quot;  Other than this, the plot is well-constructed and has quite  a few twists that keep the reader interested.<br />My one complaint with this  series of books is that the story-line is somewhat cliched.  It's your  basic &quot;rags to riches,&quot; &quot;Cinderella,&quot; &quot;the good  kid always wins,&quot; etc. motif that has been done oh-so-many times.  As  I pointed out earlier, though, Rawling has enough plot twists and quirky  details to refresh this type of story and keep both adults and children  alike turning the pages.<br />This is a book that appeals to people of all  ages and is written so that adults will not find it juvenile.  I recommend  this series to anyone who has ever fancied flying around on a broom or  turning his enemies into a frog!	2000-05-30

Although the author obviously has talent, she has wasted little of it on this book about characters with whom audiences do not wish to identify.<br />The mother in this book is a basket case, completely uncaring  about her family, and the reader finds himself unable to sympathize with  her over the loss of her son.  Most readers will sympathize with her  husband instead; he has born the brunt of her problems for years and  continues to do so after she loses her son at a class reunion.<br />I really  had problems getting into this book.  Admittedly, at the end, it did leave  me thinking about it somewhat, but it is slow and unrealistic.  I don't  consider this book to be any sort of &quot;future classic.&quot;  If I  don't consider reading a book for a 2nd time, then something's wrong (my  friends have always teased me about reading books over and over); this book  was borrowed from a friend and returned promptly when I finished it.<br />Not  horrible, but there are thousands of other books more worth your time.	2000-04-12

Words can not begin to describe the depth of emotion I felt after reading this book.  My boyfriend at the time kept pestering me to read it, so when I finally got around to doing so (you know how it is when you  &quot;have&quot; to read something - sometimes you tend to approach it with  a &quot;whatever&quot; attitude) I couldn't believe I had waited so long to  begin the book.<br />I could not put it down.  I took it to the pool.  I took  it to work.  I stayed up late (and woke up grumpy because of my lack of  sleep) to read it.  And then I wanted more of it.<br />Irving does such a  fabulous job of character development it is unbelievable.  One can see the  naive attitudes of John, Owen's best friend, so clearly and how they follow  him throughout his life.  The devotion that Owen feels toward John and his  gratitude that John treats him like he's &quot;normal&quot; is evidenced by  all that he gives up for John.  The angst of cousin Hester, the attitudes  of the townspeople...these people just came ALIVE!<br />I was so thrilled with  this book that I ran out and bought &quot;The 154-Pound Marriage,&quot;  also by Irving.  Perhaps &quot;Meany&quot; spoiled me, but I didn't find  this other work near as stimulating.

This book is a cute description of how a father attempts to coach his son's little league team while trying to a) not show favoritism to his son, who insists on copying a major leaguer's batting stance that makes him  strike out; b) deal with outfielders who would rather collect worms and eat  ice cream than play ball; c) decide whether to fire his drill sargeant  assitant coach; d) handle rabid mothers determined that their son's team  should win; and e) become the season champ without losing his mind!<br />This  book is a quick read, and has some insightful comments on the behavior of  adults who are supposed to be the 'responsible' ones in the world of Little  League.  It's not a masterpiece, that's for sure, but I got more than a few  chuckles.  If anyone has ever played t-ball as a child, or watched his  younger sibling's Little League game, then that person will certainly be  able to identify with this book.	2000-04-11

As an Atlantan, I must say this book describes the elitist attitudes of much of this city so accurately!   Not only that, Wolfe has made an extraordinary effort to accurately and historically portray the city and  its figureheads.  <br />An earlier reviewer thought this book was disparaging  to African Americans.  I completely disagree; I felt that it showed the  cynicism and hypocricies of the upper-class white &quot;good 'ol boys&quot;  in a viciously clever, cutting way.  <br />The scenes of life in prison were  astonishing; although one tends to sometimes get mired down in Wolfe's  descriptions of things and his occasional wordiness, such an accurate  portrayal of the sordidness of incarceration (or as I imagine it!) was  painted.  <br />Overall, I highly recommend this book.  I read it while in  college, and believe me, it is a page-turner.  It is, however, extremely  difficult to hide during boring classes because of its sheer size (plus, I  had the hardcover edition).  If you want a cynical portrayal of &quot;how  things really are&quot; in Atlanta, then you can take this book for the  gospel truth.<br />The ending, however, leaves much to be desired and seems a  little overboard.	2000-04-11

Although a little slow in the beginning, this book is as meticulously researched and historically accurate as the original.  I found the lessons in Irish and British history fascinating.  And the growth of Scarlett  O'Hara from selfish belle into mature woman is remarkable.  Those who would  criticize Scarlett for her insensitivity in GWTW will understand her a  little more in the sequel and cheer her on as she discovers who she really  is (finally!) and her self-acceptance.  <br />Imagine that you are chosen to  write the sequel to GWTW.  Of course people are going to rant that you are  nothing like Ms. Mitchell, and that you just want to make a profit, blah  blah blah.  I will bet that few of those maligners know that Ms. Ripley had  written several historical novels about Charleston before this book, and  she ties in &quot;real&quot; history so successfully to Scarlett's and  Rhett's time period and lifestyles that one can almost take the book for  historical fact.<br />As I stated before, this book is wonderful...as long as  you don't expect it to be the original.  Ms. Ripley has her own distinct  writing style, quite unlike that of the original book, but I feel this  allows her to express the characters better than if she had merely tried to  copy the original author's style and pace.<br />Buy it!  Read it!  It is a  modern classic, one that I came to love after several readings during which  I discovered something new each time.  Just don't rent the movie.  It is a  HORRIBLE, boring, overly-dramatic, soap-operatic misrepresentation of the  book (actually, it is nothing like the book...the plot, characters,  everything is different!).  Most loose ends from the first book are tied,  and at least readers feel like they have experienced satisfactory closure.	2000-04-11

Sure, Bridget is neurotic, and some people will tag her as a bit flighty, but that's what makes her so amusing.  I can't tell you how many times I thought, &quot;I do that too!&quot; when  reading this book (i.e. when hungover Bridget lies in bed, refusing to move  her head, and suddenly the thought, &quot;Ooh, I could really fancy some  chips&quot; pops into her head).  It shows how many women want to be raging  feminists but deep down go to war with their inner selves who just want to  get married.	2000-04-07
