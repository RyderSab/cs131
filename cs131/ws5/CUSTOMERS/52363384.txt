James Wilson's Hitler's Alpine Retreat proves to be an interesting photographic history of Hitler's Bavarian home in the Berchtesgadner area in Bavaria, Germany. Nestled among the high alpine mountains, Hitler choose this area to live away from the hustle and bustle of Berlin and its political arena. Wilson uses 270 German postcards that tells the story of Hitler's mountainside retreat. The postcards also show areas around Munich, Germany where Hitler and his Nazi Party had their headquarters and monuments.<br /><br />I found the book to be rather interesting since it shows the world, long destroyed by war and passage of time. The postcards, used for propaganda purposes, revealed an interesting reflection of the time and how Hitler liked to be presented to the German people and the world during the heydays of the 1930s. The postcards also shows the evolution of Hitler's home from a homely alpine cottage called \\"Haus Wachenfeld\\" to a more modern residence of Berghof and later, the infamous Eagle's Nest. The black and white postcards appears to be in excellent condition and its a look back in what it was. It interesting that Hitler appears to be a very much of a naturalist by outlook since he wants his home to blend with natural surrounding and an environmentist by action, even using electric power boat so not to damage the pristine lake water.<br /><br />The captions accompanied all the postcards as well as author's comments. Author seem to be bit sympathatic in his comments about Hitler and the kids photographed with him since most the memoirs written by those closest to Hitler revealed that despite of the many cute photos, Hitler rarely bonded well with children. There are also several photos showing the modern (2004) views of some of the scenes from the postcards, a nice \\"before and after\\" comparison can be made.<br /><br />Overall, a pretty informative photographic history of Hitler's Bavarian alpine home. An interesting book for anyone interested in the non-political element of Hitler's life prior to the war.non-political element of Hitler's life prior to the war.	2005-10-05

The book centered around the relationship between St. Helena's governor, Sir Hudson Lowe and Napoleon as they battled over protcols as if they were battlefields. In this book the author tries to paint out the much maligned governor, Sir Hudson Lowe in a more positive light. He secceeded only slightly to that goal. Sir Hudson Lowe, despite of Mr. Giles' best efforts, still ends up being a man of low imagination, petty minded and anal retentive individual who probably wasn't fit to supervised one of history's greatest figures. Its was Napoleon's misfortune that he was on an island governed by a jailer instead of a gentleman with a duty to perform.<br /><br />The book proves to be interesting because it reflects on the relationship between Napoleon and his greatest of all his enemies, Great Britain. Its almost amazing that someone with Napoleon's intelligence can be so naive as to think that his greatest enemy will go easy on him the second time around.<br /><br />The book also steered away from the conspiracy theory of Napoleon's murder as advanced in many of other books. Stomach cancer remains the cause of death in this book.<br /><br />I found this book to be well written and researched. Its not as detail as I hoped and its don't give us a good inside look of Napoleon's household during this period. There were a lot of interesting personalities at St. Helena while Napoleon was alive.<br /><br />Overall, this book proves to bit on the introductory level reading on Napoleon's exile to St. Helena and his life there. Easy to read and informative to a point, it should fill the void in any Napoleonic library until a more detail book comes out.	2005-10-02

The book deals with the events around the Glorious Revolution but it read more like a mini-biographies of James II and his two daughters. Of the three, Anne comes out the worst, probably because most readers probably knows all about James II but there isn't much written about Anne who comes out looking like a backstabbing hypocrite.<br /><br />The author definitely didn't paint any of the Stuarts here in any great favor. While James seem to be a caring and loving father superficially, its appears that he never did bonded with his daughters that much, always womanizing or being involved in his Catholic faith which proves to be a great dividing point within the family. Mary came out the best in this book although she whole heartedly supported her husband's effort to overthrow her father. At least, her motives were more reasonable and sincere then Anne who came out..as written above, as some sort of malice filled harpy with her friend Sarah Churchill.<br /><br />I would like to rate the book as 3.5 stars since it can be quite informative and interesting reading. However, the weakness in the book lies in its presentation of its characters, its all negative and read like a tragic soap opera in many areas. The author don't take a stand in her book and it felt like Stuart bashing all around. Something good did come out of all this but the author don't seem to notice it.	2005-10-01

Guttenplan's book on the David Irving's lawsuit against Penguin Books and Deborah Lipstadt proves to be a well written account of this trial where Irving lost his reputation as a respected military historian and gained a new one as an racist, anti-Semitic and a neo-Nazi. This is one major trade-off for any one individual. Mr. Guttenplan's book of the trial provides a clear and easy to followed account of the trial through its many issues and personalities.<br /><br />However, where Mr. Guttenplan goes wrong in this book was when he insert his own personal opinions on books and issues that were discussed and argued over during the trial. To be real, we readers are not interested in Mr. Guttenplan's opinions on these matter although he inserted it anyway. This colored the writing of the trial. This proves to be an contradiction to the general theme of the book where the author does his best to sound \\"neutral\\" when reaccounting the trial.<br /><br />It would also help if Mr. Guttenplan included some photos of the main characters of this trial as well as some diagrams of some of the areas of dispute. (Like Irving's claims that gas chambers were actually \\"air raid shelters\\"....!!??!)<br /><br />Overall, not a bad book but it could have been better.	2005-10-01

In a typical Osprey Campaign series, the book basically summarized the entire war the Malmuk wages against the their neigbors during the last few years leading up to the fall of Acre. The primary sources were probably too few to provide a lot of details but it also prevent massive information overload as well.<br /><br />I read the previous written review and thought the writer there expected too much from such a short book. But he does have certain points which Mr. Nicolle should have included, an order of battle, a good clear 3D map of Acre with scales in a single page instead of the map being compromised by a page divider. But that previous reviewer is wrong on one thing, Mr. Nicolle does give a clear reasons why the fortress city fell. Morale failure was key factor and despite of the questionable number of 15,000 defenders, there weren't too many real warriors among that questionable number. The city defense seem to be centered around the military orders and they don't seem to be in high numbers. Advanced mining and siege artillery did most of the damages. I think the lack of primary sources here is responsible for the lack of number tally.<br /><br />While the book wasn't as totally detail or totally informative as I liked, it was still pretty good reading and gives any readers who are not total experts on this field a nice summarized account of the fall of Acre and the events that led up to it.	2005-10-01

Mr. Nicolson does a fine job in relating what was important to leaders back in 1805 and tries to related that to the modern readers in hope to gained a greater understanding on how that affected the Battle of Trafalgar. I thought its a rather novel approach to the concept.<br /><br />People who wants a detail looks at the actual battle may have to look else where. The book looks at the situation from the British  perception since the author believes with certain justification that the battle once joined, was a sure victory for the British. Outcome which was decided long before the first cannon ball soared through the air on that October day in 1805.<br /><br />This book proves to be an interesting look at how leaders and style of combat were viewed and decided by the contemporaries of Horatio Nelson and how that translated to us today. Its interesting that the culture of the British Navy were quite reflective the nation its represented. Not only in terms of how they view wars but how they also regards their heroes, their battles and their enemies.<br /><br />Highly interesting book, thanks to the 200th anniversary of Battle of Trafalgar this year, we should have a good bumper crops of books on this subject. This book proves to be one of the highlights of that crops.	2005-09-19

The two authors who had the amazing luck to write this book centering on the Boston Red Sox season of 2004, tell it as it was. As a Red Sox fan myself, I can easily followed the emotional roller coaster ride that season turned out for me. Reading this book reminded me of all the joy, despair and total disbelief as our Red Sox moves mountain of miracles to win the World Series for the first time in 86 years. While some of the reviewers complaint about how the Yankees were regarded, at least its a very accurate way we Red Sox fans regards the New York Yankees.<br /><br />I think every real Red Sox fans will get a real joy in reading this book, especially those who did followed the 2004 season very closely like I did. The authors' reactions regarding many of the games won and loss, antics of the players, trading of Graciaparra and all that proves to be accurate and true to me.<br /><br />Highly recommended for any Red Sox fans and for anyone who enjoys a good story about two fans who followed their team honestly and with real zeal.	2005-09-15

While it was interesting to read about the affect of this great epidemic that most people really don't know much about, it was even more intriguing to read about how group of researchers tried to traced down this flu with the technology given during their days. This book is a history about the 1918 flu and its aftermath where researchers tries to see what the flu look like so they can find out what made it so deadly and to find the cure if it ever crop up again.<br /><br />I believed some of the other reviewers misunderstood the intention of the book but I thought the author did a good job in educating us on the subject on the search of the 1918 flu bug that went from Alaska to Norway to Hong Kong. I supposed its possible that many of the modern flu carried the traces of that 1918 flu in some form or another. Author does a good job showing how some of the major flu outbreaks like the swine flu of mid-1970s, actions taken at that time was influence by what happened back in 1918.<br /><br />Overall a pretty good science/history book on the subject.	2005-09-15

Its well written, easy to read and thanks to many sources, quite complete and informative. The biography centered more around the man instead of politics or warfare. You won't learned much about the Roman military history during the period of Marcus Aurelius but you will read quite a bit on what drove this man, how he thought and why.<br /><br />Birley write with certain objectively and with fairness regarding Marcus Aurelius. He allowed the readers to understand his subject and allowed the readers to make their own judgement on his subject. Overall, one of the better books on a Roman Emperor, I just wished that there were more attention paid to Marcus Aurelius' military life.	2005-09-15

Thomas Wentworth is a name probably little known to most Americans but he was one of the most important personalities that served the crown during the reign of Charles I prior to the English Civil War. C.V. Wedgwood wrote this book as a revaluation of her earlier work when she didn't have the access to many of Wentworth's papers. What we have here now is a more balanced view of Wentworth's life and his contributions to history. To many, he was known in history as Earl of Strafford although he held his earldom title for less then a year before his death at the hand of a man whom he so ably served. Some movie goers will remembered that title from that movie \\"Cromwell\\" where he make a brief appearance.<br /><br />The books read very easily and the author's writing skills proves to be superb. She can make the most mundane matter bit more interesting then it should be. The book appears to be well researched, you get a clear understanding of who Thomas Wentworth was and why he did what he did, as a ruthless servant of the crown and his desire for power and acknowledgement from his leige lord, Charles I. If he had survived to serve Charles I during the Civil War, he would have been a great service to him.<br /><br />Overall, a great book about a little known political figure who had an impact on English history.	2005-08-25

R.R. Davies' effort to correct that situation proves to be somewhat successful. This book proves to be very well researched, quite informative about the revolt and its background as well as the consequences the people of Wales paid for supporting such a revolt. The author clearly gives out the causes and effects of Owain Gly Dwr's actions and results.<br /><br />Where the book fell short - at least in my humble opinion - was that its written without much flair or energy. The text - informative and interesting as they were - proves to be quite dry and unexciting. In some way, it was like reading a college text book.<br /><br />But the book was well supported with maps, figures and several family tree lines that help make the events and people more understandable. Ironic, as the author himself wrote, we seem to know more about Owain Glyn Dwr's revolt then the actual man himself. Lack of a primary sources even prevent us of knowing what he looked like much less, his personality or character.<br /><br />This book was primary written for serious student of the medieval period regarding Welsh and English history. A beginner reader may get bore with the text since the book is bit hard to \\"get into\\". Despite of the exciting title, its not a very exciting book to read.	2005-08-07

This series of conflicts won by Rome, opened the way for decline of their Republican system and rise of Pax Romana of the Imperial period. While the author and some of the previous reviewers gaves hints that this wasn't a good thing, I thought as Cato did, that as long as Carthage exist as an economic and possible military rival, Rome can never gained total mastery of the region. Seeds of imperial Rome was planted during these wars although it took a while to bloom.<br /><br />I was impressed by the author's analyical accessments of who,why and how certain events turned out the way they did. He made it very clear why Rome won and why Carthage lost and it just wasn't about numbers and resources. Rome thought in the concept of total war, Carthage thought in terms of limited war. This difference determined the outcome of the First and Second Punic Wars and deciding factor behind Carthage's destruction in the Third War. Unfinished business was probably in Cato's mind when he called for \\"Delenda est Carthago\\".<br /><br />The author's book on the Punic Wars proves to be written with clarity and well grasp of the knowledge at hand. This make this book very ideal to read and understand, a hallmark of a very good military history book. Despite of the limited primary sources to these wars, the author does an excllent job in bringing out the conflicts while analysizing the source material itself.<br /><br />I would say that the only real weakness of this book lies in the fact that there weren't enough maps for novice readers to followed the wars, campaigns and battles as described in the book. Maybe diagrams of different military systems used by the Romans and their enemies would be nice as well.<br /><br />But overall, this book turned out to be one of the best books I ever read on the subject and come well recommended to anyone who have an interest in this period.who have an interest in this period.	2005-08-05
US	52363384	R1JSR5IJOOSHX5	0743226712	53542661	1776	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Good introductory book	I found 1776 to be good introductory book on the first year of the American Revolutionary War. The story centered around George Washington and his efforts to defeat the British and keeping his army intact. The author does an excellent job in creating this atmosphere and telling an interesting story of the trials and tribuations of Washington and his army during that year.<br /><br />However, this is a story that been retold and rewritten many times over. I didn't pick up any new insights or anything startling new in this book. Unlike many of his previous books, David McCullough this time around traveled on a well paved road on a subject matter covered superbly well by other authors. While the book is well written, well researched and quite refreshing in some way, there is really nothing new here that I read. I would strongly recommended this book for anyone just getting into the subject since I thought it was written with clarity and just amount of information won't overwhelmed any new comers to the subject.<br /><br />This book appears to be written strictly as a miliary history book and its seem to be a successful effort. There isn't much on the political aspects of the war. The Declaration of Independence for example, barely got couple of pages. The author's accessment of King George III is reflective of the changing way historians now looked at this misunderstood monarch who was often vifified in our history books.<br /><br />But to a well read individual, the book lacks a certain depth that make it stand out from other books on this field.	2005-08-05

The ninth man who were shot down was our 41st President to be, George Bush. The author takes great pain to create a level playing field on military morality. Taking a page from John Dower's War Without Mercy, the author takes great deal of pain to reflects our Allied forces disregarding the rules of war as much as their Japanese enemy. The author continued to followed Dower's train of thought by clearly showing that the Pacific War between two different races was a true race war, where both sides reduced each other to a subhuman level. It make killing so much easier in that regards.<br /><br />The fate of these eight men who were captured by the Japanese were already decided by the conditions of such a war. The author made that very clear. I think the book tells more then just the fate of these eight Americans. The book told a story of a rule of engagement that both sides fought under. The book told of a bigger story and these eight men who died on that island were just a mean to way. It was interesting to read how certain connections were made between the captors and the captured. The war created a lot of monsters on both sides of the Pacific Ocean.<br /><br />Overall, a pretty good book that needed to be told. Its not politically correct and while some uneducated folks might think it sounds bit like \\"America bashing\\", it tells the true state of war, where there are no rules.	2005-08-05

From reading this book, you come to understand O'Hara's strong and powerful personality. Her informative accounts of many of her famous movies proves to be a joy to read and many of her accounts of her fellow actors like John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart or Tyrone Power proves to be interesting. You also get a better understanding of how Hollywood worked back then from a woman's point of view. Her struggles against that Confidential magazine and Walt Disney proves to be interesting.<br /><br />The main focus of her Hollywood life seem to be evolved around her portrayal of famous director and fellow Irish, John Ford. Although her writing seem to sugar coated their relationship, there seem to be a real love/hate relationship between them and no matter how much Maureen O'Hara tried to be nice about, John Ford that come out of her pages appears to be a near psychopathical monster who just happened to be a superb film director. Was John Ford a homosexual and was he in love with Maureen O'Hara?? Such interesting twist of fate.<br /><br />Maureen O'Hara appears to be an pretty smart woman who probably made bad personal choices regarding her love life. In this case, she seem to ruled with her heart and not with her brain, an act that caused her much heartache in her second marriage. For a tough Irish lass, she proves to be very wanting when it came to personal choices. She came out ahead with her third marriage which tragically ended too short for her. But she seem to write them down in her book with some honesty and with a sense that even she was bit astonished how stupid or lucky she was back then.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed her book. Its well written, I liked the approach she takes in her book, as if she seem to be talking to reader directly with certain amount of candor and hindsight. Her tribute to John Wayne only increased my admiration for her. One of the previous reviewers stated that the book was full of contradictions. He is right, life is full of contradictions.ased my admiration for her. One of the previous reviewers stated that the book was full of contradictions.

Most of the book tells a basic introductionary history to the Pacific War up to the time of the mission as well as a semi-biographical sketch of Yamamoto himself. Its a pretty sympathetic sketch at that.<br /><br />The main gust of the book don't take off until the misson and its aftermath. It began with the pilot, Tom Lanphier taking a sole credit for shooting down Yamamoto's bomber transport plane and ends with Lanphier's total discreditation after his death. The pilot who ended up with most of the historical glory was Rex Barber who challenged Lanphier's claims quietly, indirectly and without rising much fuss. Barber's efforts paid off on the long run as wartime hype died off and replaced by those who want the records set straight. The fact that one of the Japanese escort pilots survived the war and he basically counterdicted Lanphier while supporting Barber helped cleared up the muddy water. Another Japanese eye-witness account published in a diary form also supported Barber and Japanese pilot accounts as well. Wrecked remains of Yamamoto's plane was found as well.<br /><br />Its a real shame that the best part of this book come only at the last third of the book. Its too bad that the author got so distracted that he lost focus of what the book was supposed to be about. Readers will get no great insights or real information on the Pacific War by reading this book, little on Admiral Yamamoto himself. There are plenty of other books on these subject matters that does a far superior job. Mr. Davis should have kept his eye on the ball since there's a real story to be told here on Yamamoto's death and the highly controversial aftermath. It is simply too bad that it took so long to get to the crux of the story so late in the book that I felt it got shortchanged. It would have helped if we had diagrams of how two pilots differed on how Yamamoto's plane was shot down and photos of the plane itself.<br /><br />For a book that was supposed to be on the long and difficult mission to shoot down Yamamoto and its aftermath, the book seem to be strangely distracted from that subject matter.<br /><br />(For some reason, I cannot understand why we Americans overrate Admiral Yamamoto so much even to this day.)had diagrams of how two pilots differed on how Yamamoto's plane was shot down and photos of the plane itself.  <br /> <br />For a book that was supposed to be on the long and difficult mission to shoot down Yamamoto and its aftermath, the book seem to be strangely distracted from that subject matter. <br /> <br />(For some reason, I cannot understand why we Americans overrate Admiral Yamamoto so much even to this day.)	2005-07-10

The book dealt a lot with Hepburn's last twenty years of her life, the twenty years which the author knew her quite well. The author proves to be quite insightful in his dealing with Hepburn although he cannot denied the fact that he was truly humbled by his friendship with Hepburn and found himself under her spell.<br /><br />There isn't anything really new regarding Hepburn's life prior to her meeting with Mr. Berg. Most of the subject matters of that sort have been covered most competently by other books and their authors. This book, basically deals with Hepburn's life during her last twenty years as old age finally began to dominate and compromise her life. Mr. Berg managed to captured Hepburn's personality during her last two decades pretty well.<br /><br />There were some insightful moments that Mr. Berg related to the readers I thought. One of the more interesing one was how Hepburn regarded Henry Fonda whom she seem to admired but not really respected in the end. Upon reading this, I thought this was the reason why Jane Fonda slam dunked Hepburn in her book when talking about working with Kate Hepburn while making On Golden Pond. Fonda's story about how Hepburn bragged about her numbers of Oscars compared to Fonda's sounds so cheap considering that in Berg's book and most of Hepburn's biographies, Kate Hepburn didn't regards the Oscars at all which is why she never been to one.<br /><br />I would say this book is strictly for Katharine Hepburn fans. Considering that Kate Hepburn regarded A. Scott Berg as her \\"biographier\\", I am bit surprised that Mr. Berg haven't written a formal biography on Hepburn instead of this lightweight material book that came out within couple of weeks of her death, making it looked like he was out to make a quick buck on her death. Is Mr. Berg coming out with a more weighter biography on Hepburn???	2005-07-08

He have a way for making the most outrageous plots more believable. That is in my humble opinion, make his Dirk Pitt books so popular and enjoyable to read. However, in this book, it seem like Crussler is either running out of fresh ideas or recycling old ones. I think I read Trojan Odyssey before but under different titles. The concept of the Celtic Homer and all that is geared toward pure fantasy. Clive Crussler is not Dan Brown in this case. There is little to be said about this book, it seem old and tired. I can't buy the plot that Crussler wrote and considering that I have brought every single other ones he wrote, that itself should be a good indictor of quality of this book.<br /><br />The book also suffered thanks to the introduction of his kids which definitely break up the momentum of the pacing of the book as distracted papa Dirk who seem to spent half of his life saving his two younguns. It seem like Crussler is trying to set up the two young Pitts as the main vehicle, retiring Papa Dirk who got married and nominated to head NUMA. Maybe for that, I gave the book three stars when it really deserves no higher then two, that this novel is a transition book. But I thought it would have been whole lot better.	2005-07-08

The approach this book takes is quite a novel one. The author's managed to captured the essence of Nelson's military personality. The author does this by avoiding the details of Nelson's life but by working on his personality, his spiritual and characteristics traits. What comes out is an amazing profile of Britain's greatest naval hero and a superb understanding of Nelson as a man and as a naval leader.<br /><br />Anyone who may be looking for the detail life of Nelson, his scandals, details of his battles and all that may want to look else where. The book is short and unlike one of the previous reviewers, I believed it to be well written, superbly researched and very easy to read. While the author admired and respected Nelson greatly, he was not above in pointing out his subject's sins. When the subject of Nelson's adultery came out in the spiritual context, Nelson's casual explanation that his soul belong to God but his body belong to Lady Emma Hamilton reflect on the curse hypocrisy that reflect the man's moral weakness when he tries to split hair with the Almighty. Nelson turned out to be a human being after all despite of his legendary  and God-like status as one of the history's great naval heroes.<br /><br />This is one of these books that must be a mandatory reading material for anyone who have any interest of Nelson or the time period of Wooden Ships and Iron Men. I think I finally began to understand Nelson better after reading this book then all the biographies previous published.	2005-07-07

The movie brought forward General Buford's finest day as a soldier and this biography bring forward the real man behind the Hollywood image.<br /><br />Its appears that writing a biography on Buford may have been a problem due to lack of first hand material. Its appears that Buford was not a writer or many of it did not survived. But what comes out from Longacre's book is story of a decent and highly motivated man who took the long road to Gettysburg. His premature death probably robbed him of greater Civil War fame since he have proved to be one of the best cavalry commanders within the Army of the Potomac by the time Gettysburg came about. What he could have done if he lived would be one of the great \\"what if\\" of Civil War trivia.<br /><br />Longacre's book is bit short on Buford's early life, lacking material would be my guess on this short coming. But the author was successful in bring out Buford's early military career, thus doing justice the subtitle of this book, \\"Military Biography\\".<br /><br />Only part I am not sure on Longacre's account was his take on where Buford and General John Reynold's initially met on that first day of Gettysburg. Most well known and movie take would be at the Lutheran Seminary Cupola where that most quote \\"The Devil's to Pay\\" came out. Although the actual words may be questioned, I don't exactly buy the author's contention that the first meeting came about in the town of Gettysburg. Why would Buford be there, away from a crucial battle? This was based on civilian eye witnesses, of course the same type of civilians even today who can't tell the difference between a new born 2nd LT and a three star general!!<br /><br />Other then that, this book proves to be quite readable, nicely researched and quite informative on the life of John Buford. This is the only biographical material I have read on Buford outside of that booklet I brought at Gettysburg back in 1995 written by Michael Phipps and John S. Peterson titled \\"The Devil's To Pay\\".ographical material I have read on Buford outside of that booklet I brought at Gettysburg back in 1995 written by Michael Phipps and John S.

A classical example of a man who was promoted into total incompetency, Hood's memoirs reflects his thoughts and his views on his military career. He spent much of his writing defending himself and his tactics and strategies. His book may be considered to be one of your classical Civil War memoirs which was written not for history's sakes but for reputation's sake. In doing so, his failures wasn't his' but those of others. As one previous reviewers wrote, Hood retreated from the truth to make his case.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the book remains quite readable, somewhat interesting and informative if only to see what Hood was trying to do and hope to do in retrospect. He could have been suffering from post tramatic stress syndrome as his actions seem to be more erratic as his wounds continued with the war.	2005-07-02

The author keep things simple and carefully summarized how, when and why so many various foreign nationals chooses to fight for a regime that proves to be so racially hateful. It seem to be interesting that Germans played its \\"anti-communist\\" card very well in recuiting foreign nationals to fight for them. Many volunteers from Western Europe came through that route. Fight against Stalin were another reason for the eastern Europeans to joined up with the Germans. Ethnic warfare, various form of anti-Semitic movements and desire for independence like the Indians were all part of the reasons why these foreign nationals fought for Germany. Some like Spaniards or the Italians were sent by their governments to Russia where they had a terrible time.<br /><br />The author also reflects on how these foreign nationals were used, how good they were and how they were trained and organized. Its interesting to note that once the German authority took them out of their homelands, many of these eastern European troops became discouraged and their effectiveness suffered. The book also point out how the Germans themselves have to adjust and adapt to many of their foreign soldiers, some like the Russians who were regarded as \\"sub-human\\" and amount of trust place upon some of them.<br /><br />The book also points out that at the end of the war, the British and American powers exactly didn't covered themselves with glory when they sent hundred of thousands of people back to Russia against their will where they were destroyed by Stalin. Western Europeans on the whole, met a kindlier fate then their eastern comrades.<br /><br />Overall, a very informative book, it got great photographs, the writing proves to be easy to read and the book appears to be well researched considering that its more of an introductory book to this subject matter.	2005-06-30

It was the period where privilaged white students (mostly), protested a war which they barely understood. It was a period of rebellion per say and while these students were the minority among the Americans, they spoke as if they were the majority. The incident at Kent State seem to be an apex of that movement. The book gives a close look at the backgrounds on events, students, guardmen and authority at large so the readers can understand how something like this could have happened and why.<br /><br />To be honest, folks of my generation have little sympathy for these anti-war protesters. While the poor folks fought and died, these students with college deferrment papers lived in comfort so they can protest and undermined the soldiers' efforts. What I find so amazing in the book was the total situational unawareness by many of the students. They totally failed to realized that what they were doing at Kent State and its surrounding area, rioting and vandalism in the name of war protest have turned off most of the \\"silent majority\\" of the American people. One of the victims who were killed were quoted as asking why the Guardmen were there in Kent State the first place. Was she totally clueless or totally arrogant? Ill-trained and ill led troops combined with clueless student protesters who seem to enjoyed provoking them, led to a lethal combination.<br /><br />Well written book, nicely researched and it even come with a documentary DVD on the subject matter. While it may not be the definitive book on the subject, this book will give most readers what they needs to know about this tragic incident.	2005-06-27

The book proves to be well written but poorly researched. It doesn't help that the author's objectivity was compromise because she was the author's grandmother, several times removed.<br /><br />In this book, it seem like Sally Denton is going out of her way to slam dunked the Mormons. Obviously, Jean Rio was misguided or misled about what the LDS was all about. Her ignorance seem to be classical that its based on blind faith and once she awaken to it, she discovered much to her dismay that her new church may not be all that she thought to be. The author stated that the Mountain Meadow Massacre was the cause of her defection but it seem all to pat to this reader. There seem to be a lot of mountains made from this molehill.<br /><br />I don't think her researched is all that well done. The author depends too much on diary left behind and make several conjectures which are not fact based. The book feel more like a personal biography of author's grandmother (several times removed), its short, readable but ultimately unimportant due to lack of depth to the research. While the subject person was important to the author, its seem like a story of dissatisfied customer.	2005-06-27

This proves to be a rather interesting book on the Chilkoot Pass trail. It seem to be a study of tourism and ecology mixed in. However, it seem to covered the trail pretty good. The first half of the book covered the history and trail used background of the Chilkoot Pass trail. There were a lot of interesting tidbits information regarding the park usage surveys where hikers of the trail had their inputs. The second half of the book dealt with the actual hiking of the trail. The authors apparently did their hike in August of 1998, the 100th anniversary of the Chilkoot Pass initiation to world wide fame. I found the hiking portion to be bit more tame although the clear, crisp colored photographs within the book proves to be totally superb. The authors don't write too much about the nature of the trail itself but just the highlights. In this, it doesn't reflect much information to anyone who may want to know what he or she is getting into. Photos helps but overall, more details would be helpful. Some part of the description also proves to be bit outdated. A good example would be where the authors describe the messy beaver pond which flooded the trail. The park service since then, have built a nice boardwalk over it. But overall, its a well written and entertaining book. Its provides some useful information on the trail and gives a reader a very general idea what to expect. Having hiked the trail several times myself, I can recommended this book to anyone who may be interested in doing the hike someday.	2005-06-14

This proves to be an excellent book on the 1381 Peasant Revolt that took place during the early years of Richard II's reign. The book will probably be compared with Charles Oman's book on the same subject but Alstair Dunn's book have been updated and improved upon from Oman's book.<br /><br />The book shows that the main revolt that started out in Kent was just a beginning of series of revolts that took place throughout eastern part of England during that year. There were various reasons for this revolt, mostly the costly and unsuccessful war with France. The author's subtitled,\\"Failed Revolution\\" proves to be an interesting but accurate description as the leaders of these revolts truly wanted to changed the economic and social structures of their kingdom.<br /><br />The book proves to be well written, easy to read and superbly researched by the author. Its a short book, less then 200 pages of text. But it does the subject justice in explaining the how, when, who and why of the events of June 1381. The only real weakness lies in lack of illustrations which this book needed. I thought the book also needed a more detail set of maps as well.<br /><br />But overall, the book come highly recommended to anyone who may be interested in medieval English history.	2005-06-14

I thought this book does an excellent job of relating Alaskan history prior to statehood. The impact of Russian America and World War II proves to be well written. After statehood, it seem like only thing that went on in Alaska were related to oil, native land claims and 1964 Earthquake. There were whole lot more that took place in this state during the last 45 years that the book covered. Unfortunately, the author seem to be enamoured with the big headlines subjects in the post statehood period.<br /><br />A thick book but its quite readable. For people living outside Alaska, this would be an excellent introduction to the Alaska's history. For the local folks like me, first half of the book remains interesting while the latter half appears to be rehashed of newspaper material. It may have been wise if the author stop at statehood and then wrote a second volume since he seem to have a decent flair for writing.	2005-06-11

I thought this book overall, proves to be well written and typically researched book on Battle for Peleliu. While definitely not the most bloodest battle in the Pacific (I think of Iwo Jima or Okinawa before Peleliu), this was a hard fought battle, won by the superb courage and skills of the US Marine Corps. It may be a battle that probably never should have been fought. On that part, the author does a great justice and skill in retelling that story and how the battle came to be and fought.<br /><br />However, we have reached a period in our nation's history where the author who only gives one sided view of the battle tell us that he didn't bother to do total justice to the Marines. After all, it was the Japanese soldiers, many of them fighting to the last man, that made the battle so bloody. The book reflects very little on these soldiers who made the Marines so courageous and heroic in the eyes of American history. There has been a gross tendency among American historians to write history from one side of the hill. That may be great during the post World War II period but we are way beyond that. Good Pacific War battle book should have chapters on the Japanese side as well as the Americans because only then, can there be justice done to the battle and blood spilled. Tom Brokow called this World War II generation \\"the greatest generation\\" but that would be a waste of words if they didn't have to go up against the greatest of enemies.<br /><br />Overall, a mildly interesting book whose style is bit dated for serious history in 21st century. It almost like reading a book on Gettysburg and only reading about the Union effort while totally ignoring the Confederate side. (I would recommend a book like Guadalcanal by Richard Frank as a prime example of what a \\"balance\\" view should read like and how such an approach does great justice to the memories of those who fell in that campaign.)	2005-06-02

It pretty obvious that the author went through a great deal of trouble to get the complete picture behind the operation which caused the death of Japanese Admiral Yamamoto. I think this book easily surpassed the dated effort by Burke Davis and gives credit where credit is due. In some ways, Glines' effort create an almost soap-opera like situation as to dealing with who really shot down the Japanese admiral.<br /><br />While great credit goes to the Americans who planned this operation, I can't help but to realized in hindsight what a great blunder this operation was in our effort to win the war against Japan. Admiral Yamamoto was a known quality to the American intelligence, his moves, mannerism, his style of operation were well known to us. As popular as he was to the Japanese troops, he was also popular with the American intelligence who was understanding him better as the time went on. Yamamoto as a naval commander was grossly overrated. His only real victory since the war began was at Pearl Harbor and even that, he didn't do a very good job. Yamamoto lost every battle and campaign since then. Yamamoto's death was unfortunate since he was replaced by series of unknown Japanese admirals and their varies abilities. And that ironically helped prolonged the war in the Pacific.<br /><br />This was probably an operation that should have never taken place, no more then we wanted Hitler dead in Europe. Hitler alive was an asset to the Allies, Yamamoto alive was an asset to the Americans. It may have been good for American morale and bad for Japanese morale but more of them died for it in the long run.<br /><br />Good book, great researching and highly readable material. For now, the definite book on the subject. It could used a little more insightful perception of the consequences of this operation instead of glorifying its success. This operation in hindsight, was not a good thing for the Americans.	2005-05-30

This guide book deals with life of this fictional character's early years as written by Bernard Cornwell. Presented here are the first five books: Sharpe's Tiger, Sharpe's Triumph, Sharpe's Fortress, Sharpe's Trafalgar and Sharpe's Prey which represent Richard Sharpe's \\"early adventures\\" (1777-1808).<br /><br />The book is basically divided into two parts. First part deals actually with the real British army of which this fictional character is part of. The study of Sharpe's British army organization, tactics, leadership, culture and society are well presented and easy to understand. Of course, throughout this history lesson, the author take pains to insert how Richard Sharpe fitted into and within the content of the series. This part of the book come with diagrams which help things along very nicely.<br /><br />The second part of the book dealt with the actual novels inwhich the author goes over each of the previous mentioned Sharpe novel with a historical eye. Included in each chaper which dealt with each novel are useful maps, sidebars of historical fact within the context of the novels and information on historical and fictional characters from each novel.<br /><br />As an avid reader of this series, I found this book to be highly useful in understanding the life and time of Richard Sharpe character as Bernard Cornwell wrote him and within the context of military history. It will surprised most readers of this series how much history Cornwell did put into his books. The book also come with useful section on Sharpe's early life before he joined the army as well as a time line of his life during the period covered by this book. The book also covered the period of Sharpe's life which wasn't covered in the novels.<br /><br />Its pretty clear that Mark Adkin wrote this book with a complete cooporation with Bernard Cornwell. This book should proves to be an super useful book to have for any fan of Richard Sharpe series who wishes to have a deeper understanding of the world inwhich this fictional character lives in. From one Sharpe fan to another, this book come highly recommended.eful book to have for any fan of Richard Sharpe series who wishes to have a deeper understanding of the world inwhich this fictional character lives in.

However, I also thought that this book was pretty bland and stale. While it packed a lot of information on the people, government, wars of the city of Sparta, it really didn't give us any great insight about this warrior civilization.<br /><br />One of the previous reviewers wrote that the author's seem to be talking over us and some way, that reviewer may be right. The author seem to take a lot for granted when he writes, thinking or hoping that we the reader, knows half as much as he does. Unfortuately, Spartan history is not a normal American or English reader's speciality. I would have wished for a different approach to the subject, something with bit more groundwork to help novice like me and most of the readers on the Spartans. After all, this book is too vague for serious scholar work while seemly too complex for introductionary readers.<br /><br />The book may have won praises from the experts on the field but I doubt if the general readers feel the same.	2005-05-13

Kennedy takes a pretty sympathatic feel on his subject. Dallek seem to write quite a lot on Kennedy's medical conditions which he suffered from his teen-age years until his death. In fact, in some ways, you can probably considered this book as JFK's medical biography as many words were written to that facts and how it affected JFK's life.<br /><br />Its appears from Dallek's perception that JFK spent much more time trying to hide his medical problems then his womanizing habits. It seem like despite of his youthful and robust appearance, JFK was a virtual cripple for most of his adult life. His family connections, wealth and name allowed him to overcome or bypassed his health issue. It was pretty obvious that he would not be allow to served in the navy with his conditions without his father's influence. When I was a boy reading his biography, I read that his \\"back problem\\" was due to wartime injuries but Dallek made it clear that Japanese destoryer had little to do with what was already there in the first place.<br /><br />Most of the book dealt with JFK's presidential years. One third of the book deals with JFK before his election and rest of the two third handled his election and his 1,000 days of presidency. Dallek's view on JFK proves to be pretty positive although he did sound disappointed in JFK's lack of action in the Civil Right movement. He obviously believed that JFK's rich lifestyle made him totally unprepared to deal with social issue dealing with white racism in his own country. I thought the book should have gone deeper dealing with his relationship with his own family: Jackie and the kids. This subject proves to be very sparse and the book's only real weakness.<br /><br />Overall, a well written book, interesting and quite readable. It may not be the best book on JFK but if you want to know his medical conditions in detail during his life, this is the book for you.	2005-05-09

Chamberlain and the American Civil War	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Well rounded biography	I found Alice Trulock's biography on Joshua L. Chamberlain to be quite readable, well researched and well grounded. Considering the length of the book, Trulock's book read quite well for most readers of any level. Well, it may not be good as the one written by John Pullen but it definitely is superior to the one written by Edward Longacre. I put that in just for comparison purpose.<br /><br />I think this biography may served as a good introduction to Chamberlain who's name have definitely reached near mythological level nowadays among Civil War readers thanks to Jeff Daniels and his role in that movie \\"Gettysburg\\". Of course, most readers would probably be disappointed that Jeff Daniel's portaryal of Chamberlain will not jive with Joshua Chamberlain of Trulock's book.<br /><br />The biography covers all aspects of Chamberlain's life. The book does a good job covering Chamberlain's military career which proves to be the most important period of his life from which Chamberlain's life will be centered around until his death. I do wish to make a point here. He died at the age of 86, a very ripe old age and I doubt if his wounds he got from Petersburg really hasten his death, it may have cause him a lot of pain but even in modern days, most people don't live that long!<br /><br />Overall, an very good biography on one of Union's more natural soldiers. A non-professional who performed better then most professional soldiers.	2005-05-09

Its an interesting collection of soldiers, some which every students of military history knows while others were folks no one never heard off until they read this book. These biographical essays proves to be a mixed bunch. Some are better then others. Some essays proves to be quite insightful and able to give an personal understanding of their subject. Others seem to be written by a clerk copying off some dossier file.<br /><br />The book is a companion to its sister volumes, Hitler's Generals and Stalin's Generals. I would put this book above Stalin's Generals but its definitely inferior to Hitler's Generals. I haven't seen titles for Roosevelt's Generals or Hirohito's Generals so I guess we are stuck with these three books.<br /><br />Overall, a pretty basic introduction essays. It should be enough to arouse your curiousity and hopefully you will read more on the subject. Some of the British generals like Slim really do need greater attention.	2005-05-05

The text appears to be well written and I enjoyed the comparsion photos between how the battlefield look back then compared to modern time. There have been comparison made between this book and William A. Frassanito's Gettysburg: A Journey in Time. I think both books got a lot of merit. Difference lies in presentation. Frassanito's book is all in black and white. Eicher's book got color photos. I liked color photos since it gives a more \\"modern\\" look in comparison to the old. Many of the color photos seem to be pretty well shot as well. It would be great if we can somehow combined both books together. I think both books supplement each other very nicely.<br /><br />Eicher's book got a lot of flak for some its numerous errors and typos. I supposed most readers can overlook that to a certain degrees. But the critics is right about one thing, that isn't Joshua Chamberlain above his name. Its rather surprising that this author would make such an error since Chamberlain is well known thanks to that movie. As for the photo sizes, yes they are rather on the small size. I can lived with it but I wondered why they were arranged in such a way?<br /><br />But overall, this book proves to be well worth the time and effort for anyone interested in the Gettysburg campaign. Its an overwritten subject matter but the interest carrys on generation after generation.	2005-04-30

Most of the information given in this book proves to be rather interesting because most of us know little or nothing about these Soviet generals outside of their names. However, its pretty clear that most of the folks who wrote these essays also know very little of generals themselves. Most of these essays read like some dossier files, giving you the achievements and awards of these Soviet commanders but very little about them as human beings. Compared to essays done in Hitler's Generals where very insightful perceptions on Hitler's generals were made, there seem to be almost none in among the essays wrote on Stalin's generals. Zhukov's essay seem to be bit overdone, overlooking his failures (like Operation Mars) while exhorting his victories.<br /><br />However, this book is quite useful in introducing these Soviet generals and gives the reader a good understanding how Stalin's general purges of the late 1930s really hurt his miliary in ways that cannot be counted.	2005-04-16

After reading this book, I was glad that I saved the old copies of Newsweek and Time magazines that covered the deaths of Saddam's sons and captured of Saddam himself. These old news magazines had far greater details on those subjects then this book.<br /><br />What does this book contained? Mostly selective special forces operations in Iraq that may be indirectly links to Saddam. These stories were well told and nicely written by an author who obviously enjoyed telling it. However, the author seem to put a rush job on the book since some of the writing seem to be bit hasty, if not little sloppy for a person of author's experiences. Also, the book have very little to do with the title and details about Saddam's capture proves to be weak and uninformative since it been told in greater details already by news magazines.<br /><br />If the book were ever to be rerelease some day, I hope it comes out with a different title instead of the misleading one that it has right now.	2005-04-15

I found The Prize of All the Oceans to be well written and nicely researched book. George Anson's voyage around the world which resulted in a captured of a major Spanish treasure ship haven't been told in such details in a long time. I believed the author did good justice to this subject. This book recounts this amazing story of a four year journey where the British fleet of six became one and over 80% of the original crew didn't make it back to England thanks to dieases, mutiny, the elements of mother nature and callous disregards by the British naval authorities who outfitted this mission. By all regards, this voyage should have been considered as a total disaster for the British Navy and its leader should have been court-martial and shot on the deck of his own flag ship. But one single act redeem this voyage and its commander, the captured of the rich and legendary Spanish galleon. This book tells the story of such voyage and the men who sailed it. Its also a story of George Anson, one determined commander who probably realized that he was falling into the pits of hell unless he can redeem himself and what was left of his men by peforming one major task which will correct all the wrongs that have happened so far.<br /><br />Its pretty amazing to read a story like this, where the human ignorance, the sea and the elements were the true enemies instead of their human opponents. Also considering that there isn't too many books written during this time period on naval affair, I would say that this book should interest any one who got any interest in the world of wooden ships and iron men.	2005-04-15

The book clearly implied that these frigate captains were the cream of the corps of naval captains. The demands of such captains compared to their counterparts commanding bigger ship of the line were considerably more demanding due to the initimate nature of the smallness of their vessel as well as its independent nature of being assigned to a frigate. Whether serving as a scout for the main fleet or on independent mission, these leaders have to proves their worth every day and under more tiresome conditions then their counterparts who commanded bigger ships. However, the pay-off comes in prize money and fame.<br /><br />This book proves to be well written and well researched on the subject. As one previous reviewer stated, this book is not for casual reading. The author managed to produced a very detail book on all aspects of a career of a frigate captain. It is not an easy read for beginners in this field. But once you can sort this book out, you come to realized that all these fictional heroes like Aubrey, Hornblower and Bolitho were not far off from real men who commanded the frigates of the British Royal Navy.<br /><br />A book that comes highly recommended despite of the heavy complexity of the subject. In some ways, many of the fine characteristics of a superb frigate captain can be applied to characters like Archer, Kirk or Picard from Star Trek fame as well.	2005-04-13

This biography of Napoleon deals strictly with his relationships with all the women in his life. In the simplistic terms, this is a book about Napoleon's romantic and sexual life. The military aspects are only given as a background material. There are plenty of books on Napoleon on his military life but this one by Hibbert proves to be a rarity.<br /><br />Hibbert paints a very complex but fair picture of Napoleon's relationship with all the women in his life. While Napoleon can be crude, tactless and perhaps an inept lover, he can also be affectionate, kind and caring.  After reading the book, it would be easy to called Napoleon a \\"male chauvinist pig\\" as one previous reviewer did but I think he was just a man of his time when all men were basically \\"male chauvinist pig\\" in one way or another. Napoleon may have been bit more extreme then the most.<br /><br />I found the book to be well written and well researched. There is a lot of in-depth look at Napoleon's personal life that comes out more strongly in this book then other books that centered strongly on his military life. His relationship with his sisters are strongly written here then most books I have read on Napoleon.<br /><br />Overall, I think this book belong to any Napoleonic library.	2005-04-13

The Chinese navy of the early Ming Dynasty was something to behold. With such a navy, they could have easily turn this world into a Sino-centric planet instead of Euro-centric one. Gavin Menzies' book does credit to giving light to one of the greatest navies ever created by a nation who had the power to extend their power on the global scale but in the end, choose not to. I am not surprised to learned how the Ming fleets expanded all over the Asian continental coast lines, even to Africa. Did Chinese fleet reached the new world, I don't doubt it.<br /><br />If the author kept the subject of the book to a level of realism, this would have been a great book. But unfortunately, this book become highly speculative as it seem like the Chinese were everywhere on the planet. Considering the scrope of the author's premise, I was wondering why the Chinese didn't reached Europe and made \\"first contact\\" (Star Trek term there) with the European governments. After all, if the Chinese can plant folks in the New England area, they can easily plant folks along the shores of Kent.<br /><br />I don't hold the author against any form of comparison like some of the reviewers did between the rising power of the Ming Dynasty against the European powers of that period. Ming Dynasty ruled a huge nation and they were on the rise. European nations at that time was small kingdoms and ducal states in a state of stagnation, its only logical that Chinese can do thing better and bigger. Situation got reversed 400 years later though and unlike the Mings, European powers were not afraid to insert their will and power over the Chinese.<br /><br />The author's premise that Chinese have been here and done that already may sound bit patronizing. Discovery is worthless unless its share with the world. The Vikings may have reached North America hundreds of years before Columbus but it was Columbus who made it public knowledge. Chinese may have discovered Australia or went through the Straits of Magellan first, but it was the European explorers who put it on the maps for all to see, published books on it and its upon them that we as the people of this world, relied upon to show us the way today. Chinese achievements may be totally awesome but equally, totally useless if no one benefits from it. It may be possible that some John Doe first created the light bulb but it was Thomas Edison who show it to the world.<br /><br />Overall a pretty entertaining book while it stay within the realm of history. But once the book began to stray off the charts of history and into the realms of speculative history, reading material regress into a lot of \\"what if\\" and \\"so what\\".ellan first, but it was the European explorers who put it on the maps for all to see, published books on it and its upon them that we as the people of this world, relied upon to show us the way today.

The author definitely knows her stuff and I found the book to be quite informative and interesting.<br /><br />However, I was bit surprised to read that this book really don't covered the plague in Dublin at all in any details. I was hoping that this book was some sort of micro-history of how one city was affected by the plague but instead, the city of Dublin was just a frame of reference to the plague. Much of the book dealt with the plague but along the European wide approach. I guess the author lacks sources to tell such a micro-history as the subtitle suggested.<br /><br />Still, I found the book to be decently written but I think the book's subtitle should be rewritten.	2005-04-12

I found No End in Sight to be rather an interesting and inspiring story about how one young woman can overcome her disability to achieved a dream. Her story from childhood to the acceptance to the Iditarod proves to be touching as well as courageous. Being legally blind and dog mushing do take quite a bit of guts and considering that most people with perfect eyesights would regard dog mushing as forbiddingly challenging, there is a lot to say about Rachael Scdoris' efforts in this book.<br /><br />Having wrote all that, I would say that this book was probably published as fund rising ploy since her story remains incomplete. This book would have been far more effective and engrossing if the author took the story into her 2005 Iditarod race itself. Although Scdoris didn't finished the race, her insights and experiences of running one of the toughest races in the world would have been a crowning jewel of this book.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad book, not a great book. I do hope that there is a second edition to this book which will have her Iditarod experiences added to it but if so, buying this edition would be waste. The twenty dollar price tag outside of Amazon will make this a tough buy.	2005-04-12

After reading this book which I thought to be pretty decently written and insightful in many of the problems that the Mormon Church suffered from. Then I was basically left with one question, was the author abused by her father or not? Since this was the core of the issue that forced her to leave the LDS faith, an unbiased (and non-Mormon) reader such as myself would be instantly be on her side. But it may not be so easy as that. Yes, Hugh Nibley was a great and famous writer for his church but was he a sexual predator of a young child as his daughter painted him to be?<br /><br />To be perfectly honest, after reading her book, I am not sure that Nibley was that kind of man. This probably had to do with the fact that suppressed memory is usually unreliable and easily prey to suggestive memory syndrome, which is implanting false memories. Did the author believed she was abused? Yes but by who seem to be the major question that she does not answer to my satisfaction. One of the previous reviewers stated that the author was abused - by a neighbor although that statement is also unreliable since it could easily be drummed up to save Hugh Nibley's good name.<br /><br />I think the weakness in the case of the author's assertion that her father abused her was that she failed to showed pattern of abuse in the Nibley household. Without such a pattern, it more like \\"she said, he said and we said\\" type of situation. The book seem to be more a case against the Mormon Church then really against her father. In that elements, I supposed the term \\"Mormon bashing\\" can be used here to describe her words against her former faith. The LDS Church in her book is some sort of a dark, menacing, Nazi-like theocracy that ruled with an iron fist veiled by a polar fleece.<br /><br />Overall, an one woman's story to get justice according to her. No Mormon should be afraid of this book. She bring out some good elements that probably needs to be laid in the open but overall, its a book where the author feel like she got an axe to grind.re the author feel like she got an axe to grind.	2005-04-05

It manages to captured the Star Wars Universe quite well and its characters. The plot immediately follows the Star Wars movie, Episode 2: The Clones War and the basic story was lifted from the script originated from George Lucas. This however take nothing away from the book which proves to be easy to read and fast pace.<br /><br />Of course, if you read this before you see the movie, the general plot of the Revenge of the Sith movie will be given away. However, if you are a true Star Wars fan like I am, I already knows the general plot of the third movie so it didn't harmed me at all. The book just go into more details than what any true fan already knows.<br /><br />I did find one major error with the continuity of the Star Wars saga. In Return of the Jedi (up in the trees with the Ewoks), when Luke asked Leia about her \\"real mother\\", Leia had vague memories of her, saying that she was beautiful and sad. But in the book and probably in the movie, Padme dies at childbirth. So how does Leia remembered her \\"real mother\\" in Return of the Jedi. Did someone dropped the ball here?<br /><br />Overall, this tome does the Star Wars series of books good justice. I would say that this is probably one of the better Star Wars books out there. For those who don't have clue about the plot, see the movie and read the book. For those already got the general understanding of the plot (true fans), reading the book or not is really up to you. Of course, not everything in the movie might be in the book. I read one previous reviewer talks about Wookies in the movie. There is no Wookies in the book. Overall, a good late night reading material, undemanding and a time killer (perfect for reading while traveling).	2005-04-04

They ranged from political generals like Keital to one of the Great Captains of history, von Manstein. Each biographical essay was written by different author who appears to have a in-depth knowledge of their subject. They were able in very few words, gives us a pretty good insights of these German commanders who fought for the Third Reich, some willingly, some unwillingly. The indivdual essays were written on the individual. Anyone looking for in-depth military history lessons should look else where.<br /><br />I was bit surprised by the latitude of some of these mini-biographies. Josef Sepp Dietrich, for example, appears to have a very much of a professional career, an interesting contrast to many accounts of him I have read in the past which painted him as Hitler's favorite \\"street thug\\" who knows nothing of military matter. It was interesting to note that Walter Gorlitz who wrote on General Alfred Jodl who was hung at Nuremberg forgot to mention that the German courts in 1953 exonerated Jodl, only Nuremberg defendant to be clear like that. Important omission considering that Gorlitz wrote rather sympathetically on Jodl. I found these mini-biographies to be insightful, interesting and entertaining reading material. A lot of information here without weighting you down with details.<br /><br />An excellent book which gives you a quick study of top men Hitler relied upon to wage war in Europe.	2005-04-04

The interviews are useful because they were done so close to the war, before politics, biased memories and self-justification really kicks in by these surviving German commanders who would write their own memoirs years later.<br /><br />The author uses these interviews to help justified his positions and theories of \\"indirect approach\\" concept which he have been harping on for a long time. Personally speaking, I see nothing really wrong with that since I enjoyed Liddell Hart's writing and see merits in them. The Germans who talked with Liddell Hart also seem to expressed that they too enjoyed his writing which may explained some of the openness they displayed.<br /><br />Overall, a pretty interesting reading material, probably considered as a mandatory reading for anyone interested in World War II.	2005-04-04

Edward Longacre's biography on General Henry Hunt was long overdue for most Civil War historians. Considered as probably the finest artillery man in the war, he was grossly overlooked by his contempories as well as historians there after until this book. I believed Longacre did pretty good justice to General Hunt.<br /><br />Hunt's contribution to the Army of the Potomac was pretty considerable. The book reflects much of Hunt's life as a preparation of this great ordeal. The author also points out that one fatal flaw in Hunt's character that proves to be so devastating to his career and life, his very sensitive and over blown sense of pride which made him headstrong, politically foolish and judgmental. This made his career harder and exactly didn't helped his post-Civil War life. But he was a fair man overall, man of honor and man of his time and class. The book was pretty well written in showing all that to the readers.<br /><br />The book revealed that Hunt spent much of the war trying to bring an unified central command of the army's artillery. Under such central command, the artillery units can be depatched where it was needed, when it was needed and with the proper strength. While that make common sense today, Hunt had a hard time during the war with it. What also make the book enlightening was that it shows why Hunt was so good with the guns. His performance at Gettysburg was a high water mark in his career and reflects his military skill as an artillery man.<br /><br />If there was a weakness in the book, the author didn't show the parallel between what Hunt was trying to do and the what other armies during that period was doing as well. Even Napoleon had an Artillery Reserves type of formation, his \\"Grand Battery\\" was under a command of a single commander moving it around like a ground formation, much like what Hunt was trying to accomplished. It was interesting to note that most West Pointers who had commands in the Army of the Potomac didn't understand what Hunt was trying to do even although their education at West Point in Napoleonics must have been pretty considerable.<br /><br />Overall, a well written book, interesting and filled a vital spot in any Civil War library.nd what Hunt was trying to do even although their education at West Point in Napoleonics must have been pretty considerable. <br /> <br />Overall, a well written book, interesting and filled a vital spot in any Civil War library.	2005-03-21

This is not your typical biography per say but more of a character study of the man. By centering on Washington's character and the impact it had to the world around him, the author managed to bring alive George Washington's humanity. By doing this, the author managed to allowed us to understand the influence Washington had as our leader during and after the Revolutionary War and how this shape our nation's destiny. The author proves to be fair to his subject. Washington we see in this book is a man full of greatness and flaws the enabled us to see beyond his iconic image that we see him today. This is a relatively short book, highly readable and gives the reader an excellent understanding of what made George Washington click.<br /><br />Since detail study of events of Washington's life is not found here, I would recommended other books if anyone is interested in such details. But if anyone truely wants to understand Washington as a man and don't want to slugged through several hundred pages to do so, then this book is for you.	2005-03-18

If I had a chocie, I would rate this book as 3.3 stars. The author tries to do justice to the first born son of one of the most famous Americans of the first quarter century of the 20th Century. He rightfully painted Theodore Jr. as a man totally overshadowed by the legacy of his father but yet managed to put his own imprint into history. I also thought it was insightful that Theodore Jr. did right to followed his father's examples even although by doing so, he ran the risk of being accused that he was merely mimicing his more famous sire. On these points, I thought the author did well. But when the author tries to paint a general picture of what kind of the man Theodore Jr. was but he was only partially successful. I would regard this a very friendly and sympathatic book on Theodore Jr. being that all of his strengths, accomplishments and great deeds were highlighted but there is nothing much written on his negatives or failures. (Even his defeat for his race for New York govenor's office was sugar coated.) As any reader would know, no one is perfect and no one is perfect as Theodore Jr. was portaryed in this biography.<br /><br />Another weakness of the biography lies in Theodore Jr.'s military career. He won the Medal of Honor of his actions on 6 June 1944 when he landed on D-Day in Normandy but I am still wondering what he did to earned such a prize. Outside of reading how brave, courageous, and a great leader of men that Theodore Jr. was, I didn't get any picture that separate him from any other brave, courageous and great leader of men that thousands of American officers who served in World War II outside of the fact that he was a high ranking officer. Maybe that where one of the main weaknesses of this biography lies, that the author's knowledge of Theodore Jr.'s military skills proves to be quite mininal. Citing Stephen Ambrose and reading out citations of valor exactly don't do justice to a man's military career. The author's sources appears to be somewhat limited. (That is bit ironic considering that the subtitled of this book is \\"The Life of a War Hero\\".)<br /><br />Overall, although its pretty well written and easy to read, I found this biography to be pretty limited. But it still the only one we have on the life of Theodore Jr. that I know of and perhaps some day, a more ambitious writer will tackled Theodore Jr. with more gusto.t limited.

I have read all the reviews written here on Amazon on this book. I can only come to one conclusion that this book may have been slightly overhyped by many reviewers who may have been impressed by von Luck's openness toward his foes, his own comrades and even those who worked against him.<br /><br />When I brought this book, I expected to get some insights from a veteran combat leader, winner of the Knight's Cross and a man who fought in all the major fronts of the European War. Instead, what I read is more of a personal journey of man with war as a backdrop. This is made pretty clear by his recounts of his combat experience, very vague and very sterile. Why is this so? The answer is pretty clear. This book was not written by a warrior but by a reconciler. Von Luck hold no rancor toward his former foreign enemies and equally, he hold none against the Nazi regime that lead his nation to doom. His book read like a \\"care bear\\" book with a military history slant. Its full of feel good views toward his friends and foes (foreign and domestic).<br /><br />I think this book was written with a classical trap built in by the author. The trap of biased memory which rejects all the unpleasantness of the war and only remembered the good things. It wasn't until he got captured and released did I felt like he was really speaking with his true voice of the time. I do not believed in von Luck's simple explanation that the oath of alligence blinded him and his fellow officers into unbending loyalty and obedience toward Adolf Hitler. A true Prussian bred officer like himself should know that Frederick the Great would preferred a true officer to be thinking men who have the courage to stand up to what may be wrong - even to a king and not mindless hollow yes men. It is ironic that its officers like von Luck who allowed the Nazi terror of World War II to go unchecked. Naive, unpolitical although probably a very moral man at heart, it seem like von Luck went through World War II with a pair of blinders on like a horse. Perhaps this sounds bit harsh but read the book and realized the total lack of insights this man have on the actions of his military forces and his nation.<br /><br />I thought overall, the book was pretty well written for its part. Its not as good as all the hypes painted it to be. There are many better and more honest memoirs written by German soldiers available in English language out there. It may be von Luck's bad luck to write his book so late in his life that he basically forgotten his first hand experiences.a pair of blinders on like a horse.

Over 25 veteran German divisions were wiped out in the massive Soviet summer offensive which was totally overshadowed by the Allied efforts in the west. Thus, this campaign was largely ignored and forgotten by most western historians who remains infatuated with the the Longest Day and ensuing Normandy campaign.<br /><br />The book proves to be well written, clearly presented and considering the shortness in length - there are a lot of information presented in this book. The reader will learned quite a lot about this campaign and probably like me, hope there will be a bigger and more detail book on this campaign someday. (Hint to David Glantz?) There is a nice simplistic order of the battle for both sides and few operation orders given out by both sides. The book gives some background to the campaign as well as the aftermath. Destruction of the German Army Group Center remains Third Reich's greatest military defeat of the war but yet, ironically, its not well known in the United States. The Germans lost over 350,000 men during this one month period while the Russian losses numbered over 750,000 men. But the campaign ensured that the German military have forever lost any chances of victory and the forward advances of the Soviet forces all the way to Berlin have been assured. Second half of 1944 was a bad year for the German military!<br /><br />This book was published 11 years ago and it should be a considered as a mandoratory reading material for anyone interested in World War II history in Europe. The scale and scrope of this campaign would be enough to surprised any American reader.	2005-03-06

This book tells the many stories of what happened inside the World Trade Center on 9/11 during the time that the first jet hit to the time when the second tower fell. That where the title come from. The stories about men and women, those who survived and those who were about to died proves to be vivid and mind-numbing at the same time. The authors wrote this book from many interviews, transcripts from phone calls, e-mails, radio calls and such.<br /><br />The authors made it clear that main building design flaws, \\"situational unawareness\\" and some sort of Titanic mentality were the main reasons why so many people were killed on that day. Conflicting information the people in the towers received from various authorities, almost a complacency minded thinking among many in and out of the twin towers. The book also describes not only of the civilians but of the courageous firemen who rushed into the buildings in their effort to save them, only to meet their doom. Much of that due to their total ignorance of what was going on. Lack of proper communication that failed to notified these men to get out. A chilling paragraph where group of court officers seeing hundred of firemen resting and at ease just minutes before the building would fall on them tells a whole sad story.<br /><br />The book proves to be well researched and vividly written. There are diagrams on how the planes hit and how the stairways were situated. It was pretty obvious that the World Trade Center wasn't designed to save many people in case of a disaster like this. The authors also brought up the fact that it seem like nothing was learned or gained from the 1993 attack.<br /><br />I thought the book could have use more photos.<br /><br />Overall, one of the most gripping books I ever read on 9/11. The reader must never forgot that this was no accident or natural act of God, but caused by an act of terror. That make the book even more gripping as an unexpected criminal act came out of the blue to cause so much death and chaos.cause so much death and chaos.	2005-01-25

Larrey created the flying ambulance system that allowed the French army to get their wounded quicker to the field hospitals, thus saving many lives. In other word, Larrey help invent the concept of \\"medivac\\" long before the helicopters was invented. Larrey also proves to be one of those rare humanitarians as he cares for the enemies of France equally as he care his own countrymen. Thus, he soon gained esteemable reputation among his nation's enemies as well as among his friends.<br /><br />The book proves to be well written and quite readable. It should be noted that this is a professional biography of Larrey, mostly concerning his professional life. The author stressed heavily on his relationship with Napoleon, the administrative red tapes and his close relationship with his patients. There are very little of his personal life written here. His wife get mentioned few times and he was a tyrant to his kids but outside of few things, we never get to know Larrey if he wasn't on the campaign trail.<br /><br />But this is a well needed biography about one of the more important but lesser known individuals of the Napoleonic France. I mean, if you mentioned \\"Dr. Larrey of Grande Armee\\" to most Americans, you might get lucky just to get a blank stare!	2005-01-22

Its part of Sue Henry's Alex Jensen and Jessie Arnold series. This time around, Jessie is without any doggies to help her around, a changed of pace for her. Most of the story take place aboard a ship and the story - which proves to be somewhat unoriginal - still was well written and paced.<br /><br />I thought due to the fact that it take place aboard a cruise ship, this was one of Sue Henry's lesser Alaskan atmospheric books. Tidbits of Alaskana flavors is shown but this proves to be rather a run of a mill thriller. This book is more of an Alex Jensen book with Jessie Arnold playing somewhat of a second fiddle.<br /><br />Despite of this rather lackluster endorsement, I still thought that the book was a page turner and the plot ended up working out pretty well. But overall, Sue Henry readers may regard this book as one of her lesser works.	2005-01-21

The author did the Napoleonic community a great service by making this book available in English, the complete set of Napoleon's Bulletins. The book also included other pages of history as Napoleons' decrees, treaties that was signed and even military reports.<br /><br />The Bulletins shows exactly what it supposed to be, a newsletter written for military consumption, and it was geared not only for the French army but also for their enemies. Thus, you will have not only the truth in those bulletins but also misinformation. It does boggled the mind to realized such effort was made to both informed and misinformed both sides of the battle line. As one previous reviewer wrote, a propaganda sheet. But it seems to work. If I was a French soldier reading these bulletins, it would be informative and if I was a their enemy, I would be misinformed. The bulletins also serves to give recognition to troops for their services or valor, both as an unit or as indivduals. These bulletins and its accompanying documents gives a clear inside view of how war looks to the men fighting it.<br /><br />However, unlike the other reviewers, I would say this much. I don't think this book is for everyone. Readers with limited background in Napoleonic military history will undoubtfully be totally confused or be misinformed themselves. Most of the bulletins were written with the understanding that people reading them knows who \\"Duke of Auerstadt\\" and what corps he commanded. It was written for people who already know what went on previously. I don't believed this is a book for beginners into this subject but someone who already have a good understanding of the Napoleonic wars and its terrains, leaders and troop types.<br /><br />A valuable book, a \\"must have\\" in any Napoleonic library and almost a mandatory reading material for any experienced Napoleonic reader.apoleonic reader.	2005-01-21

Yoshikawa's image of Musashi proves to be hard to shake. To reinforced that image, the three \\"Samurai Trilogy\\" movies starring Toshiro Mifune which was based on Yoshikawa's book, totally popularized Yoshikawa's Musashi. This is mostly due to the fact that Yoshikawa's book is probably the only book in the English language that dealt with Musashi's life in detail and even came out in popular paperback series in the 1990s. However, thanks to Wilson's new book, that is no longer the case.<br /><br />The Lone Samurai is the first English language biography on Miyamoto Musashi ever published. The book is highly readable, informative and considering the limited primary sources, pretty well researched. I seem to get the feeling that the author was trying to do his best to debunked the popular Yoshikawa's Musashi to the real man and his life. Musashi as a real man, still remains somewhat of a mystery to most historians. The book really isn't that thick and its pretty reflective on the lack of information on the subject. However, the author was pretty successful in presenting the facts in the simplist and most effective way possible for American readers for whom Japanese history, zen and culture may be bit confusing. I also enjoyed the maps presented in the book, one which traces Musashi's journey through life which I thought to be well designed.<br /><br />One of the few weaknesses I thought the book could used was that it could have probably used some diagrams illustrating Musashi's style and what make it stand out so much. If anyone out there have seen that movie \\"Kill Bill Vol. 1\\", Lucy Liu's character start her fight against Uma Thurman in a classical Musashi style.<br /><br />I should also point out that there isn't that much background information on Musashi's time period in this book so it would help if the reader have little background on the late Sengoku Period of Japan and the Tokugawa take over.<br /><br />Overall, a well written and highly informative book on the life and time of Miyamoto Musashi, one of Japan's premier experts on swordmanship and concepts that goes behind it.have little background on the late Sengoku Period of Japan and the Tokugawa take over. <br /> <br />Overall, a well written and highly informative book on the life and time of Miyamoto Musashi, one of Japan's premier experts on swordmanship and concepts that goes behind it.	2005-01-19

The author who lives in Alaska, gives the story a great Alaskan flavor as her story unfold about a man who everyone knows but didn't know, was found murdered with a shotgun blast into his chest. Stabenow's heroine, Kate Shugak seek out this mystery while dodging some blows herself.<br /><br />Since this book is part of the Kate Shugak series, the characters in the book were already established and set-up was pretty easy. The author moves the story well at a good pace and its a definite page turner. The book is a quick read. Well written, prose is good and mystery keep you going until the very end.<br /><br />Overall, a pretty good murder mystery novel with a great Alaskan flavor.<br /><br />(Trivial Stuff: If Kate Shugak really wanted to rebuilt her library, she would definitely go to Title Wave Used Books instead of Twice Told Used Bookstore. Also, initial suspects are house in Anchorage Jail instead of Cook Inlet Pre-Trial Facility.)	2005-01-17

Operations like Son Tay raid, O'Grady rescue, Desert 1 or what happened in Somalia appears to be summarized very nicely. Of course, if the reader want a greater details, there are books on most of the operations describe in this book which can give such a reader a superior understanding. But for those who do not wish to be bogged in such details, this book will work very well.<br /><br />The book appears to be written by couple of men who definitely seem to know their helicopters. However, thus lies one of the problems of the book. The authors knows their stuff so well that they expects the readers to know it as well. The book could have used more photos/diagrams of the flight vehicles they were referring to in their writing. I am reviewing the paperback version here so I have to say that lack of maps also distract from the writing. But I supposed since they were writing a more simplified version of these operations, maybe the authors thought such visual aids were unnecessary.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was a pretty decent introductionary material on many of these special operations. The reader can be satisfied with what lies in the book or they can move on. Good for the general masses although visual aids were lacking. Thus lies my three stars!	2005-01-17

As an Alaskan, I really don't considered our former governor to be a very witty or funny man. Even when I brought this book from him and had him signed it, he reminded me of some grouchy bear. I supposed to his family and friends, he must have a sense of humor since Mr. Roberts collected many of his quotes into a book.<br /><br />When I read through the book, some of the stuff he have to say were actually pretty funny, witty and somewhat interesting. I also read enough to know that many of the stuff in the book seem to be paraphasing of other sayings which I have read or heard before. Here is a classical example: \\"Government must care for the helpless. Govenment must not make people helpless by the care its provides.\\" [page 99] I have heard this statement so many times by so many people during the past 35 years of my life. The words get twisted but the meaning remains the same.<br /><br />Another thing about Wally Hickel was that as our govenor, he often don't practice what he preaches in this book. I could write a book on it but as an Alaskan, I know that Mr. Hickel's words and his actions often do not match.<br /><br />Still, its not a bad book of quotes. However, most people would have little use for it unless you are a Wally Hickel fan or lives in Alaska since many of the stuff he's quoted on were on Alaska's issues. For folks in the lower 49 states, some of that would be boring. I will end this review with one of his quotes: \\"I don't want to read what the man says, or hear him say it. I want to see him say it.\\" [page 197]	2005-01-13

The author does a good job explaining this as he traced the trouble past history of white-Indian relationship, he leaves no doubt for much of the American history, the Indians were basically left high and dry by the federal government and its white population. This situation helps created many of the myths and misconceptions people have of the American Indians today. However, by the book, the image may not reflect reality.<br /><br />The author then began to investigate what many of the modern day American Indian tribes are doing to readdressed their plight and what actions seem to be working and what was not. The book reads very nicely, clearly written and reflects on many information that most Americans today are not aware of. That the American Indians are conducting an silent revolution out there in various forms of guises that might reshape the way other Americans look at the American Indians and how they look at themselves.<br /><br />The book come highly recommended and its informative context should benefit anyone who reads it.	2005-01-13

The key of his near forgotten fame was that he was the governor of Alaska for only two years but yet, an important two years as Prudhoe Bay was being opened up and he was Alaska's point man during that time.<br /><br />Miller led a somewhat of an interesting life and most of the book geared toward his life. By chance, he became our governor when Wally Hickel went to Washington DC to be the Interior Secretary for President Nixon. Most Alaskan historians thought he did a decent job but he lost his job to Bill Egan \\"Mr. Alaska\\" himself so Miller faded from the public scene to a point where he doesn't even lived in Alaska anymore. But reading his book, it not too surprising that is so. Miller seem to be your classical transient. Of all our governors we had in this state, Miller had less roots and commitments to our state then any of them. He have led an interesting life but he's an opportuntist in Alaska, homesteaded and became an politican.<br /><br />Still, the book read very well and Miller's life, while never exciting or adventuresome, proves to be classical Alaskan story even if his stay in our state proves to be limited.	2005-01-13

This well written and researched book by Jonathan Waterman tells an interesting and pretty harrowing experiences of things that can go wrong when you climb a mountain. In this case, that mountain is Mount McKinley, the highest peak in North America and a popular climbing peak due to its accessibility. The author takes these \\"statistics\\" of injuries, accidents and deaths into a learning experience for the readers of his book. These \\"statistics\\" often results from accidents, carelessness, medical edemas, unprepareness, lack of skills and bad luck that can happened to anyone at anytime on Mount McKinley. But the author make it clear that if all the proper precautions, preparation and training were engrained, a climber would have most of the favors on his side (her side).<br /><br />I think this book probably could use an update. The book ends at 1990 which's 14 years ago and many things have changed and more lessons to be learned.<br /><br />This book basically go over many of the bad things that happened to people on Mount McKinley and why. The author make it clear that this is not a very safe mountain to climb despite of its yearly heavy traffic and high summit success rate. The book should be considered as a mandatory reading material for any first time climber of Mount McKinley. As Otto von Bismarck once said, \\"Only fools learned from their own mistakes, the smart ones learns from the mistakes of others\\". I think the author is trying to get that message out.	2005-01-13

His body was never found. Vernon Tejas was the second person to solo summitted the same mountain but he lives to tell about it. This book tells of that story of how Tejas managed to conquered North America's highest mountain during the dead of an Alaskan winter and survived.<br /><br />I thought the book was pretty well written and entertaining reading material. The book read more like the biography of Vernon Tejas which may disappoint some readers who may be looking for a more in-depth and detail account of Tejas' climb. Personally, I saw nothing wrong with that approach since the book is about Tejas and his efforts. Background on the man is useful in understanding what drives the guy to do a solo climb up Mount McKinley in the dead of winter.<br /><br />While the book won't win any awards, I thought it was an interesting piece of work on an event that need remembering. Tejas' accomplishment seem to have faded with the passage of time and this book should help rekindled his place in history.	2005-01-13

A very interesting book on a rare event where the Indians actually drove out their white conquerors from a long established colony. In 1680, the Pueblo Indians of northern New Mexico rose up in massive revolt against their Spanish overlords and managed for a short time, to regained their independence from colonial rule. This revolt came after nearly four generations of colonial rule where continued Spanish misrule generated this revolt.<br /><br />The book proves to be well written and researched as the author explained how this revolt came to be. According to the author, much of for the revolt had to do with the following factors. Rejection of Christianity, economic dependency on the white, inter-racial marriages between whites and Indians and how that reflects on the fact that small numbers of Europeans were controlling larger numbers of Indians. In four generations, many of the Spanish colonialists have intermarried with the local Indians, blurring the racial lines. White intimidation fades as the conqerors and the conquered blended in.<br /><br />The book proves to be a short read but it turned out to be very informative and rather an eye-opener. Spanish did managed to reconquered New Mexico once more in the 1690s, never again were the Indians sucessful in pushing out their European overlords which have been in place for generations. (It would be like if the 1862 Dakota Indian Revolt in Minnesota were successful!) The book come highly recommended for those interested in western colonial history.	2005-01-12

The book is written with clarity despite of the fact that its packed with information. Its pretty amazing that the book is so detailed but yet so readable. (I should note that having a good background on this time period would be very helpful.) The analyical insightfulness of Mr. Duffy's writing proves to be one of the strong points of this book.<br /><br />The book covers all aspects of this army. The leadership and officer corps as well its privates and non-commission personal. There is an interesting chapter where the author goes from province to province of the Hapsburg Empire, summarizing its ethnic make-up and its military representation. It really does give a clearer understanding of the people who make up this multi-national army that serves the Hapsburg so well during that war. The coverage also extends well into all the branches, infantry, artillery, cavalry, support units as well as Croats who get a chapter of their own. Background materials are given, there are maps and 12 pages of tidbits appendix information which proves to be quite useful.<br /><br />It should be noted that this book do not relate much about the Seven Years War. Its a book on the Austrian Army's internal structures during that war. Thus you may have to wait until Mr. Duffy's second volume where it suppose to show the Austrian army in action during that war.<br /><br />I would say that the only major weakness I could easily spot about this book was that it could have used more illustrations, both black and white and color. Also, this book wasn't written for novice reader of the subject. If you don't know who Maria Theresa was or what years the Seven Years War took place, I would recommend looking for an introductory book on the subject before moving up. (Like one of them Osprey books for example.)<br /><br />This book without a doubt, belong to the library of any one who have any great interest in this subject matter.

I found this part of the book to be highly interesting and if not truely admirable that the author was able to come up with this story that must be told. I had hope that the author would have gone into greater details into this platoon since many of the members are still alive today.<br /><br />The book would have been better if the author kept his focus on the platoon and not on the \\"bigger picture\\". Most readers who read this book will already have a good understanding of the Ardennes Offensive by the German forces in December of 1944. If they do not, this is not the book that will give you any great insight on the battle. There are plenty of books out there that does a superior job of telling of the Bulge then this one can at any length.<br /><br />Worst are the numerous errors in the text which I can't seem understand. A good examples would be on page 64 when author wrote \\"Irwin Rommel\\" instead Erwin Rommel or on page 115 when he wrote \\"Hermann Black\\" instead Hermann Balck. Was this a typo or a careless error since even the index got the wrong name! Also on page 54, the author goes into a lot hype about the \\"Death Head\\" insignia which every SS soldier wear...even Muslim SS soldiers! Author is also mistaken the fact that Peiper's 1st SS Panzer Division, \\"Leibstandarte\\" was originally built as Hitler's personal bodyguard unit and they never served as guards at the camps. Those guards made up the 3rd SS Panzer Division, the \\"Totenkopf\\" which was not Peiper's parent division. While these are just sample errors, individually they are rather harmless but collectively, you began to questioned the author's researching ability and it does downgrade the overall quality of the book.<br /><br />Still, I enjoyed this book about this extraordinary platoon made up of extraordinary men. Their story needed to be told but I wished it was told in greater details and without the redundant history lesson that serves no one but entry level reader who may be misled by many of its errors.I wished it was told in greater details and without the redundant history lesson that serves no one but entry level reader who may be misled by many of its errors.	2004-12-25

I read quite a lot of Ed Greenwood's Forgotten Realms novels and I enjoyed most of them. However, Elminster in Hell is one of his lesser works. While I have enjoyed Elminster's earlier books, this one was bit on the boring side. It had an interesting premise and story but the writing and concept got rather boring as the story line got repetitive. Its also a book of \\"flashbacks\\" which is nothing but Elminster trying to buy time for himself. The story also dispelled some disbelief at this weak arch devil who have Elminster in his power but still allowed himself to be toy by his victim. Overall, I thought the book was the weakest of the four Elminster novels and one of Ed Greenwood's lesser efforts.	2004-12-24

As the Boston Red Sox fan, I found this book to be utterly interesting. The book tells the story of how the money poor Oakland A's managed to fielded a winning team year after year on a budget which is only the third of the many of their rivals. Oakland's General Manager, Billy Beane have developed a new system of accessing talents and getting them cheap. In essence, it all about statistics, theories and possibilities that defied the traditional way for accessing baseball talent.<br /><br />Of course, as a Red Sox fan, I found this book to be a great interest because the Boston General Manager, Theo Epstein, is the great believer and follower of Billy Beane School of Thought on accessing talents. But unlike Beane, Epstein can applied this concept with a big checkbook and the result I believed was the glorious Red Sox victory of 2004.<br /><br />I think after reading the book, I believed someone like Epstein can applied the lessons of Beane and make it work more effectively with a big bankroll. Beane on the other hand, have to let go of players he developed as their demand for a larger paychecks continued. Thus lies Beane's great trap in life. He can maintained a winning team but probably never get to the next level because he can't hold on to what he have developed. The next level is, of course the World Series Championship.<br /><br />A great book for any Red Sox fans out there. It may give us a clue on what Epstein is thinking about when he is giving out contracts, or rejecting a player or getting new player. If not a Red Sox fan, the book is still highly educational in the revolutionary way baseball is changing in front of us.	2004-12-24

The Special Illustrated edition really advanced the story since the book shows prints of many of the arts, photos of buildings and  European locations as mentioned in the story. It really does helped to have the print of the Last Supper in front of you as the mystery unfold in the book. For many of us who never been Europe, such illustrations proves to be very helpful and I was more then happy to pay a little more if that enchane the story further.<br /><br />But after reading the book, I can understand why some of the people wrote negative reviews and picked at it. The main theme of the story would offend many who take their Christian faith very strongly and don't tolerate much lee way on the subject. Just look at that Martin Scorsese's film on Christ as a prime example of why this book got slam-dunked by many reviewers! If you are such a person who is dogmatic regarding your Christian faith, it may be that this book may not find your favor regardless of its fictional nature.<br /><br />The book combined elements of history, art and religion into the story. Some of the information are true, some are not and others stretch the fabic of truth and fiction for story's sakes. But the combination of all of the above is the primary reason why this book proves to be so entertaining, that the reader cannot tell fact from fiction, generating interest, debates and research among the readers.<br /><br />This book is a definite page-turner. Like it or not, you would feel compelled to read on, perhaps in pleasure, perhaps in anger but it will keep most readers glue to the end.

The length of the biographies goes from 8 pages for Augustus to two and half for poor boy Romulus Augustulus. Longer the biography, more important you are I guess.<br /><br />In each case though, the biographies are well written, nicely researched and quite interesting. This book make an excellent quick reference that would introduced the readers to other books if they wanted to know more. The book comes with maps and illustrations of each emperor, mostly from images from Roman coins made in their likeness.<br /><br />At great introduction to Roman history, useful and fun reading.	2004-12-10

The revolt of Queen Boadicea was one of the last major revolts against the Roman rule in England during the era of the Roman Empire. Graham Webster tells an interesting and if not astounding account of how this revolt got started and the pragmatic response of the Roman army reacting to it. There are enough background material in the book to familiarized any reader to this time period. This may be one setback in the book since it won't be until page 86 that the book finally get to the revolt. The book comes with photographs, charts, maps and other illustrations as well.<br /><br />However, it should be warn that this book isn't for everybody. The text - interesting for me - may sound bit dry for other readers who may not read much about the anicent history. Many readers may find it somewhat boring having to read 85 pages of background material to get to the revolt. Recommended only for people who have a great interest in this subject matter.	2004-12-10

The book traced this from the Napoleonic Period where the seeds was initially planted to the final event when the French withdrew from Rome in 1870, allowing the Italians to regained their foremost city and making it their official capital once more.<br /><br />The book proves to be well written and researched. The author present his material with clarity without cluttering it up with too much details. It was interesting to note that this national unification wasn't exactly a national event in Italy. It was basically the works of the Kingdom of Piedmont and a small numbered of well educated urban minority. Its appears that the rest of the Italian peninsula was dragged into it by sheer force of will.<br /><br />The book comes with some documents that gives a nice contemporary feel to it. I thought more maps and maybe some illustrations would have been nice. But overall, the book proves to be an excellent introduction to this subject and should provided a solid foundation for further studies on the field if desire.	2004-11-29

But I'll put in my two cents worth anyway by saying that reading this book did surprised me quite a bit. Katharine Graham wrote an amazingly honest auto-biography which enabled her readers to gained a great insight into her character, her life and her accomplishments with a great deal of understanding and clarity. To be honest, she was not what I expected. Its bit ironic that she actually became her own person only after the suicide of her mentally ill husband. The book also reflects strongly on the newspaper business and how her own presence helped make changes to that industry.<br /><br />The only real weakness of the book was that it didn't go into much details after the pressmen's strike. The Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton years rolled by pretty much as a blurr. Maybe her life wasn't so interesting any more during those period. Personally, I would find that hard to believed.<br /><br />Still, a well deserving of a Pulitzer, one of the better autobiographies I have read in recent years.	2004-11-24

The Life of Chesty Puller	Books	3	12	19	N	N	Slightly dated  biography of a great Marine	I considered this book to be a fine introductory material on this famous fighting Marine who served our nation so well. However, due to the rather biased approach, it may not have been as complete of a biography as it could have been. Burke Davis seem very much enamored with Chesty Puller, so much that the readers have to beware not to fall into a classical trap of a \\"perfect man\\" biography.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />It was interesting to note that the book does not give any reflection of how Chesty Puller felt about the intregation of the US Marine Corps, one of the tramatic events of the Marine Corps history during Puller's long career.<br /><br />But the book overall, provides a lot of information on the career of Chesty Puller and the readers will have a clear understanding why he was considered to be such a legend in the Marine Corps. As long as the readers can overlooked the racial slurs that most professional historians won't write in their narratives, the book serves an useful if not a limited purpose. I would like to look forward to reading a more balance account of Puller's life, a book that allows me to understand the man, his strengths and his weaknesses, which like all human beings on this planet, he was blessed with. The book only reflects on his greatness and that make him only a half a man that he truly was.	2004-11-24

Its written with great deal of clarity and it was pretty obvious that great deal of researched was done although lack of sources seriously hampered the details. I thought Turnbull wrote this despite of the title, with a more Korean slant then the Japanese. It may be that all these new sources from the Korean side excited the author enough that he wrote this from Korean side a bit more in detail then the Japanese side. The Chinese accounts remains almost minor despite of the major role they played in the war.<br /><br />Although book may be regarded almost like an introductory level into this war, this is probably the only book on the subject written in English. Still, it would helped the readers if they had some background of the Sengoku Period of Japan to familiarized themselves with many of the characters who played a leading part of the invasion.<br /><br />The book comes with excellent maps and illustrations. Most of the Japanese illustrations were contemporary works while most of the Korean illustrations were modern colored works. They were all useful in helping the readers understand the conflict.<br /><br />I was bit troubled over certain errors written in this book however, made by the author which make me think some of his other assessments may also be questionable. A good example was his reference that Battle of Sekigahara was fought in October 1600 when anyone who knows anything about Japanese history will know that it was fought in Sept. Also, I thought it was bit amazing that the author failed to realized that during the Sekigahara campaign, both sides were basically \\"fighting\\" for the Toyotomi family, a fight between retainers so to speak. Of course, one side had a greater ulterior motive then the other side. The fact that Stephen Turnbull don't understand this make me suspect what else he may not understand. After all, he's one of the greatest authorities on Japanese samurai history in the English speaking world!!understand this make me suspect what else he may not understand. After all, he's one of the greatest authorities on Japanese samurai history in the English speaking world!!	2004-11-20

Pringle's biography on Theodore Roosevelt to be bit overrated. Probably because it was published back in 1931 that make the material so dated. Passage of time and reassessment of Theodore Roosevelt make this book somewhat of an oddity. Despite of being published just 12 years after Roosevelt's death, it was interesting to read that this was basically a pretty negative outlook on a great American. The style of his writing, the way he jumped forward and backward simply confused the subject matter sometimes. It doesn't helped that the author never really get into the mind, personality and motives of his subject. Many of the issues surrounding Roosevelt's life are simply not in-depth enough to be interesting or informative.<br /><br />I supposed for readers back in the 1930s, this book had a lot to offered. But nowadays, with works by Edmund Morris, David McCullough, Nathan Miller and Kathleen Dalton, there is really very little purpose in reading this book. It doesn't offered any thing new nor offered any great insights.<br /><br />I read it because it was so highly acclaimed back then. It won the Pulitzer Prize and won high reviews back then. But reading it now after going through many of the modern materials on Roosevelt, make Pringle's work looked weak and stale.<br /><br />Not really recommended for anyone unless your curiousity get aroused by ancient work.	2004-11-20

The book is written with certain amount of balance in presenting both sides of the fence, the clarity of text is clear and it appears to be well researched.<br /><br />The book explains why the Allies suffered from series of military defeats during the first six months of the war which ended ironically with the Battle of Midway which sealed the fate of the Japanese effort to win the war. The book goes into details of the Allied defeats. While it does covered the entire Pacific area in general, the American efforts are presented here in greater details. The Philippines Campaign for example, got a lot of attention compared to the Singapore Campaign. In the typical Toland's style, the narratives were taken from individuals which were then woven into the general history format.<br /><br />I found the book to be interesting and informative. Only real deficit appears to be that the book was published in 1961 and some of the information presented may be old news to veteran military readers. But for newcomers to the field, this would be a great introduction to the subject matter at hand.	2004-11-18

Remini wrote what I can only considered as a very unbiased and objective account of life of Joseph Smith who founded the Church of Latter-Day Saints, known as the \\"Mormons\\". In what can be considered as a very short book, Remini make no judgement on the faith that Smith founded. He write with certain level of clarity and fairness on the actions and purposefullness of Joseph Smith, as a product of his environment, his society and world which surrounds him.<br /><br />The book doesn't try to justified or damned Joseph Smith as a religious leader who founded a new faith in this nation, but tried to accessed him as a man of his time. Well researched, nicely written and fast reading material, I think this would be a great introductary biography on Joseph Smith for anyone who might be interested.<br /><br />If I had a singular gripe, it was that it was too short. I wished Remini would have done a full scale biography on Joseph Smith in details. Maybe the author can write one on Brigham Young who definitely needs a biography that don't praised or condemned him excessively.	2004-11-15
US	52363384	RXPYPUQX1IBF2	0811714519	63891302	Right Hand of Command	Books	2	1	4	N	N	bit understated study	The subject of this book proves to be interesting but I think the author was bit too critical. In this book, the author spent a lot of time being critical toward how Civil War generals uses their staff. He think that with all these European examples, our Civil War generals could have done better. Of course, what the author forgets is that European examples which he often harped upon was not available in the United States during much of the war. The American Civil War was basically a war between civilians in uniform. The author was critical about why Civil War generals don't used their staff like their European counterparts. The answer should be obvious, their staff was untrained, inexperience and uneducated in most part, to the military. Not even Grant had a first class staff until the last year of the war, then they were all hard-core veteran officers.<br /><br />It could be that there wasn't enough source material for the author to investigate clearly. But by being fixated on this narrow subject, I don't think the author really understood what kind of men officered the armies of both sides.<br /><br />This book seem to give a false impression on reality of staff work during the Civil War. Amateur officers serving a West Point trained general usually don't get much trust as their European counterparts. This was one point that the author consistency seem to overlooked.	2004-11-03

Trefousse wrote a definitive biography on this great Republican that helped initiated the Reconstruction period after the post-Civil War period. The sub-titled: 19th Century Egalitarian proves to be an aptly named since Stevens proves to be one of the foremost egalitarians of his century. The book clears up the myths and misconceptions that Stevens were often regarded in and set the records straight. Well written, nicely researched and with superbly insights, I can only wished that the book went even deeper into Stevens' life.<br /><br />The book also goes into Stevens' strengths, weaknesses and his troubles. I thought it was a honest effort on the part of the author to showed the reader the complete man and the account of Stevens' life proves to be balance and fair.<br /><br />One of the more interesting aspects of this book lies within the struggled between Stevens and Andrew Johnson. The fight between \\"reconstruction of the south\\" to the \\"restoration of the south\\". This struggle had far reaching consequences in our nation's politics as well as racial relationship. Although product of his time and era, Stevens proves to be far ahead of himself in terms of race relations. It was interesting to learned that his concerns lies not only with the blacks but also toward Indians and Orientals. The book reflects accurately in the end that Stevens was a true egalitarian in the truest form.	2004-11-03

The book overall, seem to be confused and paradoxcial. In one hand, Grant must used the Bible as his primary source and yet in the other hand, he tries to debunked what the Bible is saying. The reader learned very little about Peter Simon, Jesus' leading disciple that they couldn't find out from reading the Bible. We know little about the man and Michael Grant's book revealed nothing new or noteworthy. To be frank, I don't understand the purpose of this book.<br /><br />I believed that Grant's mistake was trying to separate Peter from faith into history. Due to such limitation on the source material, it would be difficult to do such a task. St. Peter was a religious figure of faith, he cannot be nothing less than that and any effort to do so, would be contradictary.<br /><br />It would be nice if Grant was more adventuresome and tried to make some educated hypothesis on Peter but he didn't do that as well. The book reads very dry, almost clinical in nature which is often opposite to most of Grant's books which have been interesting as well as fun to read. It almost seem like Grant was uncomfortable writing this book as it was for the reader reading it.	2004-10-30

In this, I am trying to say that the book proves to be very tedious in nature, somewhat boring and very long-winded. The book is cluttered with information and material that could have been written in a more clearer and interesting style. Reading this book reminds me of sitting in a large college class listening to a professor while looking at the top of his head, droning so endlessly that even the most interesting subject, would be dead in the water.<br /><br />The subject matter, that the American Revolution changed radically the entire American culture from its English roots to the a more home grown American one. But this concept alone, isn't that new. I read some thing like this in my high school history book and in many other books on the American Revolution, they often talked about how the war for independence changes the social, political and economic structures of the new nation. But this was the first book that I read that dealt directly with that subject.<br /><br />It did win the Pulitzer Prize but I am not sure why. A very scholarly written material, probably best left for scholarly minded readers with interest in this subject.	2004-10-30

Its a whole new look at Battle of Hasting. The author does this by reassessing all the sources of the battle including the Bayeux Tapestry, previous books written on the battle and by drawing his own conclusion based on what he have learned. In doing this, the author have determined that perhaps, the armies were larger then initially believed, Norman cavalry may not have play that much of a role in the battle and King Harold probably didn't died from an arrow in his eye. There are more of course but it would be easier if you read the book yourself.<br /><br />The book rested basically on the author's own interpretation of the campaign but it appears to be well researched and well written material. The main source of the battle, the Bayeux Tapestry gets an indepth look and it may be that it didn't get all the facts right.<br /><br />Interesting book, well recommended for anyone who got any interest in mediveal warfare or English history in general. For anyone out there who got a great interest in the battle itself, this would be a \\"must read\\" material.	2004-10-30

The subject here was the First Minnesota who founded lasting fame on the fields of Gettysburg. The author, Richard Moe, did a superb job bring this regiment alive, using primary sources of diaries, letters and reports.<br /><br />The book traces the regiment's history from its Minnesota origins as it mustered into the Union army and fought its campaigns from First Manasass to Gettysburg. After Gettysburg, the regiment wind down before it was discharged in February of 1864. But it was at Gettysburg where the regiment met their final fame and glory. Just as 20th Maine showed their right stuff at Little Round Top and General Greene's brigade held by their fingertips over at Culp's Hill, First Minnesota saved the Union center by making a \\"banzai\\" charge against overwhelming odds with successful result. Their losses were heavy. The book skillfully reflects on their heroic actions against unsurmountable odds. It proves to be a very exciting and informative reading.<br /><br />They came on the field with roughly 330 men and lost 229 men (killed and wounded), about 67% loss. It was not the most in the Union Army for this battle. 24th Michigan of the Iron Brigade for example lost 73% loss while 2nd Wisconsin lost up to 77% of their strength. First Minnesota ranked 15th among Union regimental losses based on percentage.<br /><br />A well written book, superbly researched and easy to read, many Civil War regiments could wish that their stories could be as well told as the First Minnesota's thanks to the author. I believed this book belong to the \\"must read if you are interested in the American Civil War\\" list.	2004-10-20

The premise of the book appears to be very straight forward, Vichy France was an not only a collaborator ally of Third Reich but continued with unusual zeal, their persecution of the Jews within their borders. Vichy France's zealous anti-Semitic practices apparently surpassed most of Hitler's other allies including Italy. What seem to be so sad was the this phenomonen was not restricted to the government officials but to the French population overall within the Vichy borders. The book also shows how readily Vichy France supported Hitler's Germany and such supports seem to be a collective effort.<br /><br />The book proves to be well written and superbly researched. It was easy reading as history book goes and I enjoyed the prose and flow of the writing. Its definitely is a very uncompromising look at a nation and people who actions have been overlooked too long simply because some of them were actually our allies during the Second World War.<br /><br />After reading this book, its pretty clear why every French who lives through this period quickly associated themselves with the resistence movements which many of them were helping to suppressed during the war. Its a sad story of a nation who sold their soul to the devil and used their defenseless Jewish citizens to appleased that devil.	2004-10-06

Ironically, I met the author on Alcatraz where he was signing books.<br /><br />The book basically tell his life story in the nutshell. His upbringing was not a very happy one as he seem to get himself in all sort of trouble. His life as a criminal ended when he was arrested and sentenced as bank robber. The main gust of the book centered around his stay on Alcatraz during its last years of operation. His stories proves to be interesting but limited. That was because of 143 pages or so, only 30 was related to his experiences on Alcatraz. Surely Mr. Coon could write whole lot more then that. If his experiences on Alcatraz can be summed up in 30 pages, he must have slept a lot while he was there!! There is another 35 pages or so on information on Alcatraz with his personal insights. But those proves to be somewhat limited. I supposed some of the Asian-Americans might find his notes on Tomoya Kawakita to be offensive since Mr. Coon seem overly fond of using that inmate's nickname - which was \\"Jap\\".<br /><br />Overall, an interesting short memoirs of a sort. I was bit disappointed that author's experiences on Alcatraz was so limited that he can summed it up so few pages. I was expecting a lot more tidbits and insider information from the inmate point of view.	2004-10-06

Its well written, often filled with humor as he reflects on what he have learned since his changed of heart. It also a great book since it deal with coming to terms with his past and how it was all catching up to him. I think Shatner finally began to realized that no matter what he does for the rest of his life, he will always be connected with Star Trek, always be known as \\"Captain James T. Kirk of the Starship Enterprise\\" and that the way it will be long after he's dead and buried.<br /><br />So with that in mind, this book comes recommended. Its story of William Shatner and not Star Trek in general. He writes on his experiences regarding the phenomenon he helped create over 37 years ago and how he think about it when he wrote the book. (I thought his impression on autographs was very interesting.)	2004-10-06

The book was clearly written for scholar-like readers and not really for casual reader who may not find this book an easy reading. The writing style isn't very good and text reading somewhat boringly.<br /><br />One of the elements I disliked the most about this book was that the author liked to used French quotes without English translation when he tries to make a reference. You have to look in the back of the book for the footnotes on exactly what was written. I found this approach to be awkward and silly which handicapped the flow of the passage - unless you read French that is. If the book is written in English, write down the English translation to the quote (or put the translation immediately below the quote), anything else is just some sort of \\"elitist\\" over kill.<br /><br />Otherwise, this book should interest anyone with a good background on the French Revolution but anyone else should not bother with it.	2004-09-27

Its also an event that have been heavily clouded in myths and legends, thanks mostly to many self-serving memoirs, personal accounts and entertaining Hollywood movies.<br /><br />The book proves to be a very unbiased account of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, the author traced the all events leading up to the fight, detailed account of the fight and what came afterward. As one of the other reviewers wrote, it showed that in Tombstone, there was no definite \\"good guys\\" versus \\"bad guys\\" but all sides were basically grey. That is an excellent point that must be stressed heavily.<br /><br />If there is one book to read on this subject, I would recommended this book as the sole book for this subject.

In almost all cases, I discovered that the authors have done their homework and their accessments of what is a good seat or bad turned out to be true. Although their reviews on food remains subjective, I discovered that what they say about it also got a lot of truth behind it. Oakland do have one of the best hot dogs and many dogs wrapped in up in these tin foils really do not tasted all that good. (Is that why we often overdose these hot dogs with massive amount flavoring?)<br /><br />I have been to many other stadiums of the Major League and after reading the book, I discovered that what the authors' have to say would be a great guide to anyone else who may be looking to do such a vacation. Although the season is dying out this year, there is always next year and years on end.<br /><br />When I go on such road trips, I usually do buy my tickets ahead of time and usually try to get the best seats money can buy. The authors' book seem to be written for people who do this on the fly or on the budget. There is nothing wrong with that but they should know that not everyone do it like they do.<br /><br />The book come highly recommended by someone like me who likes to take a baseball road trips and have done so in the past.

While it is very detail, its also very readable and that is an asset since this book can be read by almost any one who is interested in this subject.<br /><br />The author wrote in his preface that he may be bit harsh toward General Sherman and he is. He also wrote that he is writing this book as if the event was unfolding and that is also good. However, the two approaches does not match since the author is very harsh  toward Sherman but only due to hindsight and research that he can be so critical of Sherman. Sherman didn't benefit from the author's hindsights and research so he was making mistakes that the author pointed them out with great relish. Is this a fair approach?  The author also seem to have a bone to picked with Liddell Hart's military biography of Sherman. He definitely don't like that book and made every effort to debunked it. While the author is hard on Sherman, he is also quite hard on the Confederate commanders, Johnson and Hood. It may sound like the author don't care for any army commander of any army during this campaign. I thought the book sometime read like two commanders were playing \\"dumb and dumber\\" act.<br /><br />Still, it does go through the Atlanta campaign with an certain level of authority and it does helped clear up many elements of the campaign which have not been very clear before. Outside of the author's treatment of Sherman, Johnson and Hood, three stooges that can't do much right, the book does a great job.	2004-09-24

Its appears that the author is trying to show how the French lost the war then how the Germans won it. Its seem pretty clear from the author's perception that French were pretty incompetenece from the top on down. But that didn't make it a sure thing for the Germans. The author also pointed out that Germans showed plenty of ineptitude of their own during the war. What made the difference between the two was that French military incompetenece and their reliance on their famed Chassepot rifle couldn't off-set German professionalism and their artillery - both elements which proves to be the main factors why the French lost.<br /><br />I was also reminded that the French army of 1870 looked a lot like the French army of 1940. In both cases, the French were military incompetent and their leadership at the top were totally brain dead. The courage of the individual French soldiers kept them in the game as long as they could but Germans won out in the end. Both times, it was a speedy victory for the Germans.<br /><br />I thought this book was well written, nicely researched and easy to read. It doesn't bogged you down with overwhelming details and its theme seem to be pretty clear from the beginning and it was from that point of view that the book seem to be written for. Well recommended even for casual reader, I agreed with one previous reviewer that this book won't replaced Howard's book but its a great fresh look.	2004-09-01

I found this book to be well written and very clever in its presentation. While Battle of Bosworth remains one of the main subjects of the book, its not the true subject of the book. The true subject of the book rest on the author's efforts to restored King Richard III's good name and hopes that his actions were done in honor and respect while maintaining the ruthless elements of his days.<br /><br />However, the author failed to make his points because he failed to delivered on certain elements of logic and facts that cannot be changed. Even if we accept the illogical fact that Edward IV was not a legitimate heir of the House of York, he remains the legitimate King of England. As a legitimate King of England, Richard swore an oath of loyalty to him as his lord and liege. While Edward's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville was unpopular, it was legal. Their two children cannot be considered as bastards even if their father was. (Sons of a bastard is not a bastard themselves.) If their father was the legitimate King of England, then they were his legitimate heirs and Edward V was Richard's lawful and legitimate King. They cannot be bastardized because of their father's status. The author totally missed this point in his long chapters which from his perception, seem to legalized Richard's actions because his older \\"half brother\\" (according to the author's premise) was not a true heir to the House of York. That shouldn't matter at all.<br /><br />I think the author was bit obsessive about how Shakespeare protrayed Richard III instead of how historians protrayed him.<br /><br />Richard did murdered his nephews, he did overthrow a legitimate young ruler to gained power and he lost his throne and crown to an upstart Henry Tudor who probably had every right to be more ruthless due to his initial lack of foundation of his family rule. I have no doubts that Richard did have many redeeming quality as the author like to point out and he was a \\"man of his time\\". But his actions reflects a power hungry man who wanted to be King of England. He fought well at Bosworth and was let down by his other commanders. The author failed to explained why Richard allowed himself to be place in a situation where he might be easily betrayed.<br /><br />The battle analysis was bit better and I really kind of wished that the author stay on this with greater degree. His attempts to turn Richard's reputation proves to be bit meaningless and it took away from what should be the main subject of the book.ns reflects a power hungry man who wanted to be King of England.

Nelson remains the main subject of the book but the author didn't skimp on the other major characters of the campaign as well as putting his massive technical knowledge of Nelsonian navy into the context of the book and campaign. One of the more interesting elements of the book was how the author compared the activities and motives of the two major players of this campaign, Nelson and Napoleon.<br /><br />I thought the book gave a very complete coverage of the entire naval campaign, told expertly by a naval expert. The author armed the book with many illstrations and maps that make reading and understanding the campaign that much easier. I thought it was one of the better books written about the campaign.	2004-08-31

I found this book to be highly interesting in its content. The author shows how the Douglases went from the front line defenders of Scotland to a dominant magnate house that could challenged the King of Scotland. It was interesting how initially close the Douglases were to the royal house of Scotland (the Bruces). It was that closeness that allowed the Douglases to rise to power and become one of Scotland's greatest clans during its heydays. But ironically, it was the inability of the Douglases to adjust and adapt to the changing relationship between themselves and their rulers as the nature of medieval kingship changes. This led directly to the tragic results of this family.<br /><br />While I found this book to be very informative, I also found it to be very dry reading material. Despite of the exciting subject matter, the author's text proves to be very clincial in nature. The book also don't give much background material so readers who are relatively new to the subject field (Anglo-Scottish conflicts and basic Scottish medieval history) may feel bit left out on many of the references the book mentioned, references that author obviously expect the readers to know already.<br /><br />I recommended this book for experience medieval readers who would like to have a closer in-depth look at one of Scotland's legendary families of the medieval period.	2004-08-29

Lee. Most of the book seem to be centered around Stuart's activities. Despite of what the other reviewers wrote, the author appears to be pretty sympathetic toward Stuart, running interference for him during Stuart's less then stellar performance during the Gettysburg campaign for example. In most all cases, the author tries to present JEB Stuart in the best of light. Once Stuart died at Yellow Traven in May 1864, the book come to a rather quick end as the remaining 47 pages dealt with what happened after Stuart's death and surrender of the Army of the Northern Virginia. This entire section get rather a short oversight even although it covers 11 months of the war.<br /><br />The book I thought was well written and nicely researched. Its readable but I thought its not really for first time reader material. Some background reading should be required before reading this book. But as a military history book on Confederate cavalry of Army of Northern Virginia, I don't think this book rank very highly.	2004-08-28

However, I believed that the author spent too much time being a tour guide of the city of each stadium instead of the stadium itself. I wanted a lot more information about the stadium of each city instead of the city itself. I can find other books on the city if I need to. I don't need to read about it in a book I thought would be about major league baseball stadiums.<br /><br />Each stadium is given a very short review and rest of the chapter centered around the sights, sound and places to stay. I really wanted to know bit more about the stadium, best seats, worst seats, food, and that sort of thing.<br /><br />I got the 2001 edition and it does feel dated already. I think this book have been effectively replaced by \\"The Ultimate Baseball Road Trip\\" book that came out this year and contain a huge wealth of information about each stadium and its suroundings. But in that book, the stadium and baseball remains the main focus; in \\"Fields of Dreams\\", it seem to be the city. In many ways, \\"Fields of Dreams\\" should have read like the \\"The Ultimate Baseball Road Trip\\" but the author wasn't ambitious enough to do it right.<br /><br />Overall, it does have useful information but they are rather minor and its dated. The \\"other\\" book have effective replaced it so I don't see why any one wants to buy this book any more.	2004-08-26

Background on Elizabeth's parents, Henry VIII and doomed Anne Boleyn comes in handy in explaining the tension between Elizabeth and her half sister, Mary.<br /><br />The author takes a Thomas Costain approach to history as she kind of mixed some fictional by-lines to moves the characters around within the historial context of the book. I think one reviewer before me called it \\"casual\\" and that might be a good word for it.<br /><br />But the book reads very well, it is an interesting and fun to read. It probably don't stand up to the test of the time thank to recent books that have come up on Elizabeth's early life but I think I think this book will be a nice first step on to that subject.	2004-08-26

I enjoyed reading this book by Howard Snyder which retells the story of the Wilcox Expedition to climb Mount McKinley during the summer of 1967. The climb was a total disaster as 7 out 12 climbers frozed to death, making it one of the worst climbing incidents in modern American mountaineering history.<br /><br />The author was one of the five survivors and he retells his side of the story on how this disaster took place and why. In doing so, he appears to put a lot of blame on Joe Wilcox, the expedition leader for making poor decisions that directly and indirectly, led to the death of seven climbers under his leadership. Of course, he also cites the Park Service for forcing him and his two friends joined Wilcox's expedition since the Park Service had a \\"four man team\\" rule.<br /><br />The story Snyder writes proves to be interesting, scary and quite numbing. It also cast Joe Wilcox as the main reason why the climb went bad. I think from Snyder's point of view, Wilcox was the captain of the ship and he's responsible for everything that goes on that ship (aka: expedition).<br /><br />This proves to be an interesting read but you shouldn't read it without having Joe Wilcox's book, White Winds nearby. White Winds is Wilcox's response to Snyder's book.	2004-08-25

This autobiography written by former Alaska governor, Jay Hammond proves to be a superbly entertaining book about his life - both personal and political. Hammond writes in a very easy going style as if he was sitting right next to you talking about his life story.<br /><br />As a politican, Hammond reflects a classical Alaskan character. Conservative with liberal bias. I found some of his accounts as our governor to be quite interesting. Especially how he dealt with the pipeline and the Permanent Fund. His personal life also reflects a great deal of adventures as he made his way to Alaska. He must have been very lucky to survived all these plane clashes!!<br /><br />Can't go wrong reading this book.	2004-08-25

I enjoyed reading this book, simply because there isn't too many books out there on the War of the Austrian Succession. In fact, I am willing to wager that probably only one American in 500 would know what this war was all about. (Maybe 1 in 1000?? One in 2000??)<br /><br />I am pretty familiar with this war and that helps a lot. The book was written by scholar for scholars basically. Its not an easy book to read to the uninitated reader going in blind. I think I read one previous reviewer suffering from that element.<br /><br />I thought the author have presented a very readable book, considering all the complex issues, battles and campaigns of this war. The author clearly defined this war as one of Empress Maria Thersea's finest moments as she fought off a very aggressive Frederick the Great and a superb Prussian army, gathered up alliances and waged an effective defense of her crown and territories although she lost Silesia for good.<br /><br />If there was a weakness in the book, I thought the maps were totally lacking. Considering how important geography was in this conflict, the author should have put in some effort in giving the readers practical maps relating to the war. Some battle maps and illustrations would be nice too.<br /><br />But its a book for scholars, written by one so I guess I may be asking too much here. Excellent book overall, well worth the time and money to get it and read it. Just have little bit of background to the conflict to get more out of it.	2004-08-25

White Winds tells the story of the Wilcox Expedition of summer of 1967 when seven out of twelve climbers frozed to death along the slopes of Mount McKinley. This proves to be one of this nation's greatest mountaineering disasters in modern history.<br /><br />The author was the leader of this expedition and this book was in all reasons, written in response to the book written by Howard Snyder, titled \\"Hall of the Mountain King\\" where Snyder basically put most of the blame for the disaster on Wilcox's shoulders.<br /><br />Wilcox's book proves to be up to the task. Not only he writes very well and tell a chilling story of how his expedition met with disaster but he supplied details notes, letters, logs, radio communications and even a detail scienific explanation of the devastating winds that killed seven members of his expedition.<br /><br />Obviously the author was making an all out efforts to clear his name and defend himself from Snyder's book. But instead of attacking Snyder, he was effective in blaming nature for the disaster. According the Wilcox and cornerstone of his defense was that the forces of nature, so strong and so powerful that no one was ready to deal with it and the seven who died, died because of such force that was beyond any human control and not because of any human element, mainly him.<br /><br />I think both Snyder and Wilcox covered what happened on that mountain pretty well in their two books. Anyone who have any interest in mountaineering should read this book as a good object lesson. Not being a mountaineer myself, I read it for the exciting but tragic story and for that, it was an experience enough.	2004-08-25

The book showed us nicely how well organized the logistic system of the Macedonian Army was and the hand of Alexander was everywhere.<br /><br />But the lesson the book shows also reflects the reality of today as well. Even this modern age, how well a military forces performed in combat reflects directly on how well that military forces is supported logistically.<br /><br />A mandatory reading material for any military historian and just about any professional soldiers out there.	2004-08-23

I am bit amazed that someone of Mr. Schom's talent as a writer and historian would be wasted on such bias effort. I would like to ask Mr. Schom if Napoleon have done anything good or decent in his life since he really like to paint this French Emperor and one of history's greatest military commanders as little better then petty dictator with delusion of grandeur with a Hitler complex.<br /><br />Mr. Schom would probably find a greater acceptence among Napoleonic readers if he would be more fair in his assessments of the facts and characters. When you are too bias against your subject, then its pretty clear to any reader that you got a grudge against it.<br /><br />The book overall, doesn't add anything new to anyone who is well read on the subject of Waterloo campaign. For experience readers, this book will end up in your local used book store. For casual readers, there are many anti-Napoleonic traps that author insert to make claims that Napoleon was nothing more then an early 19th century misanthrope.<br /><br />PS: I believed HMS Bellerophon was a ship of a line, not a frigate.	2004-08-21

The actions and accomplishments of the Royal Navy is known to many people but somehow, the deeds of the Royal Navy during the last year of the Pacific War remains somewhat casted in the shadows of the mighty American Navy that dominated the show. In this book, the author John Winton attempts to remedy that oversight with a very interesting and reflective book on the British naval activities in the Pacific during the last year of the war.<br /><br />The book reflects not only the military activities of the British navy but also the initial shortcomings of this overstretch navy and the initial disdain that many Americans felt toward them. Its interesting to read how the British overcame their design flaws (like wooden carrier decks) and managed to gained the respects of the American naval leaders to whom they were closely allied to. It also tell how the British naval efforts helped win the war in Burma and against Japanese territories elsewhere in that general region.<br /><br />The book proves to be well written and easy to read. I thought the only real weakness came when the author insert too many accounts of the European theater of operation as the background material. But this book covers an area of military history in the Pacific War that haven't been written up in great detail. Well worth the money and time to read it.	2004-08-19

The book proves to be extremely easy to read, understand and to appriecated because the author managed to amalgamate all elements that went into this tale. Everything from Pope Julius II's warmongering Papal policies and the love/hate relationship he had with Michaelangelo, enemies of both men and how they influence the project as well as Michaelangelo's personal life. The author put all these different tales together to woven an easy to follow book that fantastically tell an amazing story behind the painting of the Sistine Chapel's ceiling. A feat considered by many to be one of the finest works of art.<br /><br />I think the book only real weakness lies in the the lack of illustratons on Michaelangelo's Sistine Chapel works. It would be nice if we had a close-up look at what was being painted instead of just a big overall view.<br /><br />A book well worth reading and learning from.	2004-08-14

The book clearly explained how Scotland adapted the highly touted Swiss military system without understanding why it was so highly regarded. So while on paper, the Scots held all the advantages, there were many weaknesses within that army that led to its destruction.<br /><br />One of the better books written about this battle which not much have been written about.

Reading the interviews from the 1950s to the 1990s, it revealed an interesting evolution of Schulz's character, insights and his development as a cartoonist as he grow older and his &quot;Peanut&quot; empire got bigger. While you can't considered this as a biography, reader will definitely get a clear understanding of Schulz's personality from these interviews.<br />I was surprised that there was no mentioned of how Schulz and NASA got involved since Apollo 10 used Charlie Brown and Snoopy as code names. Such absolute faith in NASA probably needed further review.<br />Overall though, an excellent book that probably should be read by all fans of Charlie Brown and Snoopy strip.	2004-07-08

Schom doesn't get into the actual battle itself until the last part of the book so if you are looking for more complete account of the actual Battle of Trafalger, you should look for an another book. This book looked at the entire scope of the campaign from 1803 to Neslon's funeral in 1805.<br />One good aspect of this book was that it gives a limelight to William Cornwallis, a hardy and highly skilled British admiral who held everything together and helped set up the situation for Horatio Nelson to take over and win the battle and campaign. Cornwallis have often been overlooked and shortchanged by many historians who previously have given him only lip service before moving on to glorious Nelson and his deeds.<br />One bad aspects of this book was a near unchallenged disrespect and disdain the author have for Napoleon. What did this French Emperor do to Schom's ancestors that made the author so hostile? From what I read, it seem that entire defeat of the French fleet lies squarely on Napoleon's shoulders and if a French cabin boy trip over himself and began to shed tears, it was Napoleon's fault!! This author hates Napoleon to the bone.<br />But overall, it was an interesting reading of the Trafalgar campaign, easy to read, nicely researched and presented (except when Napoleon get involve) and overall, a justice to Cornwallis.	2004-07-07

Upon reading this book, I discovered that this book is perfectly geared toward the casual reader and those just coming into the Napoleonic study. The book proves to be well researched in information, very easy to read and equally easy to understand. I basically regards this book as very good introductory biography on Napoleon up to the end of 1805.<br />To a veteran Napoleonic bluff, this book may not served your purpose outside of reading a relatively objective book on Napoleon's early career. As other reviewers wrote, the book tries to revealed Napoleon the man instead of the Napoleonic concept that often swirled around his life and accomplishments.<br />So if you are deep into Napoleonic, you can probably skip this this book and the next. If you are just getting into the subject matter, this book and the next would make an excellent introduction to Napoleon's life and career without overwhelming you with information overload.	2004-07-03

The book isn't for the casual reader, it would really helped if you have some background to the subject material already. The book is basically written from the Russian point of view which proves to be quite unique and interesting since many of the stuff on the Eastern Front always have a German slant to it.<br />The book appears to be well researched. Its obvious that the author had access to many Soviet material not available to previous historians on the subject. But as other reviewers before me have written, this book is not very exciting nor is it written with a lot of grace. The author can present the researched material well but he can't put it into a historical story. The book read like a dry textbook, there is no feeling to events at hand and to be honest, the book get rather dull after a bit. If I could jest, this would be a type of book Mr. Spock (of Star Trek fame) would write, all facts, no spirit. It would really helped if you have a great interest in the subject matter since if you do not, the book might go unfinished.<br />But the book do get high marks due to the fact that it revealed in great details (boring as it may be at times), the Soviet efforts surrounding this famous siege and battle of Leningrad. Russian story of their war against Germany is one of the great unexplored territories in our studies of World War II. Its will amazed many Americans how dwarf our efforts were against the Germans compared to the efforts of the Russian military.	2004-07-02

Reddington have been acknowledge founder of the famous Iditarod Race to Nome, one dog mushing race every Alaskan virtually follow even if he/she isn't a fan.<br />The book appears to be well written and the author was probably well supported by the family members of Joe Reddington in writing this book. This make the author very sympathic toward his subject. While that itself is no great crime, like all student of history, I would like to know Joe Reddington bit more readily then his public image. Like all human beings, Joe Reddington had his moments of greatness and his flaws. I would like to have read more on his failings as well as his accomplishments. But nevertheless, the book does justice to the man and his accomplishments.	2004-07-01
US	52363384	R1TJ8BW9ICWEYS	156849372X	593057001	The Conquering Family	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Fantastic series	I am writing here for all four books instead just the Conquering Family. Its easier that way since most people who read the first book will definitely end up reading the rest of the three books.<br />This series by Thomas Costain have been around for a long time. Its one of the easiest to read written history on ruling family of the Plantagenats who ruled England from Henry II to Richard III. That's nearly 300 years of English history. Costain's story telling skills mixed with great history make this series one of the best set of books in introducing anyone to mediveal English history.<br />Having said that, it should be warned that Costain's history isn't exactly very scholarly. The author does take few liberties with the facts, even putting in few liners here and there to advanced the story. Even some events which may be more mythological then true, have been told as if they may be true. Costain also have his own bend to certain views and his sympathic views on certain events and personalities may not reflect history's. (The series almost does read like &quot;historical fiction novels&quot; and has been mistaken for such by the uneducated. Especially by those who worked in bookstores.)<br />But Costains' creative inputs should not distract from the fact the most of what written in his four books proves to be very entertaining and accurate history. Even those who may not care for mediveal history have enjoyed it since I have recommended this series to several friends who regards such subject as one of the most boring subject next to watching dust bunnies grow. By the time they were done with my books, they were ordering their own set.	2004-06-30

Both books proves to be well written and Lamb's storytelling does make both volumes read a lot like historical fiction. However, the book appears to be well researched if not slightly outdated by our standards today but still acceptable overall. (Both books been around for a long time.)<br />Because of the easy to read format as written by Harold Lamb, these two books could be read by almost anyone who have any interest on the subject. Its a great introduction material and easy to digest information would be welcome by many. Not only that, it tells a great story in an energic and entertaining way.<br />I was told and agreed that these two books compared favorably with Thomas Costain's four books series on English Plantagenat Kings. If you enjoyed Costain's works, you will definitely enjoyed Harold Lamb. They both writes in that style that make history into a story. Lamb would put into some fictional liners to advanced the story and takes legends into facts. But its a great way to start into the history of the Crusades and even if some of the modern works (you might read later on) might straighten out the details into proper perception, these two books helps in providing the background material which was so easily read and understood.<br />Excellent starter books, thick but very readable!!	2004-06-30

The book was initially published in 1968.<br />Views of this book, coming from a Japanese scholar who lives during the period of Japanese warmongering from 1931 to 1945 turned out to be quite insightful and perceptive for most American readers. Its always a treat to read what the \\"other side of the hill\\" are saying but this book bring out an unique point of view.<br />The author appears to be extremely hard on the Japanese leadership during this period. His views are also pretty hard on the behavior of the Japanese military and their commanders as the primary warmongers of Japan. Of course, historically speaking, this view is correct although the author almost seem to be venting on them with vengence!! The author however, also point out some of the good things that happened during the war for Japan, like ending white colonialism in most part of Asia and ironically, ending the role of the military forever in Japanese government thanks to the Allied powers!!<br />A book well worth your time to read, it will helped any historian gain a well rounded view of the Pacific War which started nearly ten years before Pearl Harbor.	2004-06-24

In its well written and well researched form, John Toland managed to create a book that would give readers how things look from the Japanese side of the war. The book covers all aspects of Japanese history from 1936 to the end of the war. This includes political in-fighting within the Japanese government during the 1930s where the members of the Japanese military were murdering politicans who stood in their way. The picture the author painted wasn't a very pretty one. Japan appears to be nearly schizophrenic in her behavioral pattern before and during the war with the United States. The book revealed Japan's attitude toward the United States with a mixture of opposite contradictions. On one hand, Japanese leaders understood that the Uniteds States is far more powerful then the Japan in almost every aspects of military production and manpower but yet believed that victory against the United States is possible due to spiritual paramountcy. This decision come about despite of the heavy Japanese military commitments on the Asian mainland. The book also reflects on the noblity of the Japanese effort to survived the war as well as her barbaric actions toward her enemies. In many ways, it shows the two sided coin of Japan. Japan that can be noble and generous as well as the Japan who can be cruel and maleficence.<br />This is a pretty thick book but its also very readable. The author's prose is smooth and its one of these heavy books that most well trained readers can breeze through with certain amount of joy. For would be historians out there, probably a required reading material for anyone who have any interest in the war against Japan, it might do good for any Japanese out there to read it too if they can get a Japanese language translation verison.	2004-06-24

I considered Edward Longacre's biography on George Pickett to be a pretty good one. The author goes into considerable length to show the reader what kind of man Pickett was behind his &quot;Gettysburg persona&quot; that most Americans know him from. The picture we get is one of strange contradictions of a man who can do a dishonorable thing like abandoning his own son to a brave and couragous soldier.<br />The author proves to be very sympathic toward his subject. However, not even Longacre can excuse Pickett for his foolishness at Five Forks. It was interesting that the author did not investigate the effects of post traumatic stress disorder which must have affected Pickett after Gettysburg. That may have answered many of unusual downgrading of Pickett's abilities as commander. (Another famous combat leader, Marshal Michel Ney of Napoleon's army also suffered from it after Russian Campaign of 1812 and his performance suffered thereafter.)<br />However, the book come highly recommended and it proves to be well written, nicely researched and very informative.	2004-06-24

I found Eric von Manstein's autobiography to be highly enlightening and insightful in its presentation. Eric von Manstein is considered by anyone who knows anything about World War II as one of the war's finest military commanders, on par with history's great captains. Von Manstein's accomplishments easily put - Patton's for example, to sad shame. As much as our American egos get ruffled at such statement, its pretty clear that von Manstein was the brain behind many of the greatest German military accomplishments in that war. It was therefore, quite interesting to have his take on how he developed the \\"sickle\\" plan which led to the fall of France in 1940, or his Crimean campaign and his effort to restored the Eastern Front after Stalingrad. His concept of mobile defensive warfare often ran countered to Hitler's rather entrenched warfare mode. The difference led to the dismissal of the field marshal.<br />I would say that only thing that held this book back was the usual old trap that most authors fall into when they write about their own career. The bias memory kicks in from time to time even for the great von Manstein as some of his errors were gross over and even acts that got him in trouble at Nuremberg war crime trials were overlooked.<br />But in retrospect, the book proves to be interesting, informative and well written by one of World War II's greatest military commanders who is almost totally unknown in our nation.	2004-06-23

However, it should not be mistaken like some of the previous reviewers that this book is some sort of history book on the German forces. If anyone wishes to read how well the Panther or a Tiger did in combat, read else where. This book remains a data reference source. In this book, you will find all you ever want to find on the technical military data of all individual German military vehicles and their different model types. I found the information to be highly useful in almost every usage I get out of it, as a historian, wargamer, modeller and even as a film reviewer.<br />The book claims to be a definitive book on the German military vehicles and for once, this is not an over hype. It would be hard to find another book which hold this much information and data on all the individual German military vehicles as this. I would considered this book as one of the mandatory books in any World War II historian's library.<br />(In clarification, this book covered all the combat vehicles which served with the German military. It doesn't covered vehicles like Schwimmwagen or Kubelwagen or regular army truck.)	2004-06-23

This insightful book covered the initial year of the German invasion of Soviet Russia. I thought the book was pretty well written and the author was able to go beyond the basic assessment as he tries with certain success, what went wrong and what went right during the initial seven months of this campaign. The author made it clear that it took a lot more then bad weather, Hitler's interferences and over extension of German forces to cost Germany any chance for victory during this period. He seem to be in the mind that German overall military leadership remains badly divided and also gives credits to the Russian willingness to trade space for time as they took the initial devastating losses and converted that time into a defensive position where they could launch a set of massive counter offensives. It seem that Germans were fixated into short term goals and objectives while the Russians were gearing for the long haul.<br />The author give a fair and pretty perceptive views of the strategic and tactical situation during this initial seven month period of the Operation Barbarossa. Its appears to be well researched and I enjoyed the book coverage of the leading military commanders of the campaign. I thought this book proves to be quite thoughtful and interesting to read.	2004-06-22

I agreed with the previous reviewer that the book wasn't very well organized. The amount of information in this book proves to be quite impressive but it hard to get to at time. Still, I found it to be a very useful reference book and since it covered all type of artillery and their ammo, its an useful single volume to have. What I found so useful personally, was to identifed many of individual cannon types which I photographed during my many trips to the Civil War sites. I have taken hundreds of photographs of cannons and this book proves to identifed all of them. Ironically, finding the photo in the book to match the mystery cannon photo of my own, with the information already there under the book photo proves to be quite useful.<br />Depending on your usage, this book may worth the price.	2004-06-20

In fact most of the book geared around the historical part of the Chilkoot although if anyone wishes to real a great book, Pierre Berton's Klondike: the Life and Death of the Last Gold Rush is definitely superior.<br />But I was basically looking at the book as guide to hike the actual trail. Having read the lastest version of this book and having hiked the Chilkoot Pass several times by now, I found the trail guide to be somewhat dated and rather uninformative. The basic details seem to be there but it looked like many of the information came second handed.<br />Book remains a pretty good introductary effort but I would recommended further research before hiking the trail.	2004-06-18

It proves to be well researched, easy to read and interestingly written. All major and even minors aspects of this great engineering effort lies between the two covers. Its almost defied the mind when you traveled on this railway how difficult it must have been to built this railroad. Roy Minter's book easily bring forth all the information needed to understand this endeavor. Author proves he knows his subject well, having been the railroad's vice-president before his retirement. This remains a definitive book on the history of this railroad.<br />Built to bypassed the Chilkoot Pass trail into the Yukon's interior, the railroad was successful in its effort. Ironically in the present time, the railroad now helped support the Chilkoot Pass hikers who needs a ride back to Skagway after completing their hike.	2004-06-18

What make this book so interesting is that it also spotlights on many of the players who used to played in Alaska during its short summer seasons who later on became big time Major League players like Mark McGwire, Dave Kingman and Randy Johnson. But overall, the main focus of the book remains on baseball in Alaska, the history of the teams, players and coaches along with some of it more eccentric fans. It may be that some of the players we see in Anchorage today during the summer season, may be a future Hall of Famer.<br />The book comes highly recommended for anyone interested in baseball history or enjoyed baseball in general.	2004-06-18

Well written, very gripping and a real page turner, it was no surprised that many people even today, would pick up this book to read. There was a movie based on this book which was also pretty good.<br />This is however a first book in a series although it can be a stand alone book. I would probably recommended that since the series can be somewhat of a let down after a such a fine novel. Technically speaking, the series that follows Advise and Consent branched off to two separate direction. One direction leads the United States into ruins while other direction leads the United States into victory and renewal over our enemies. The situation can get pretty soap opera-like and after you are done, it also felt bit dated.<br />Thus, I would recommended that you stick with this book alone and forget the series.	2004-06-16

The Barrier and the Javelin proves to be well written and well researched book which centered around Japanese and Allied strategies that led up the stalement battle at Coral Sea and total American victory at Midway.<br />The book revealed that Japanese naval forces, despite of all its abilities, superior ships and planes and its highly trained crew, could not defeat its outnumbered enemies due to poor strategy. It was clear that the Japanese have badly over extended themselves and try to be too clever with their strategies which backfired on them.<br />I agreed with the previous reviewer that the author, H.P. Willmott was bit too judgmental on the wrong sides at times. A good example would be those Japanese raids into the Indian Ocean which was a terrible waste of men and material, especially since the British navy in that area served as no threat and primary duty of the Imperial Navy was to chased down the American carriers. But on the other hand, I thought Willmott's condemnation of Admiral Yamamoto was right on the mark. Too long have this Japanese admiral been overrated by many historians based on one successful attack on Pearl Harbor. Yamamoto fumbled terribly at Midway. (Personally, I thought he fumbled badly at Pearl Harbor too.) The author also cites superior American military intelligence as well as a lot of luck to win a battle of Midway that the Japanese should have won hands down.<br />Anyone with any interest in this subject should be reading this very insightful book. Its not really for casual reader so I would recommended folks who already have a good background on the Pacific War to tackled this book. A good companion book to Willmot's earlier book, Empires in the Balance, both books, in my humble opinion, belong to any library of a military historian who got an interest in this field.	2004-06-16

Albert Speer as many of the previous reviewers have already wrote, proves to be a great mystery. However, the author provides some very interesting insights to Speer's rather naive but contradictory asute behavior during the time he serves for Hitler.<br />The book proves to be very readable and easy to get into. Its provides a very informative picture of Albert Speer without overwhelming you with mindless details and gives a clear idea what kind of man Speer was, before, during and after the Third Reich.<br />Its interesting that of all the individuals of Hitler's inner circle, Speer was intellectually, culturally and morally above the rest but Fest make it understood that Speer had some sort of psychological blinder on and spent much of his post-World War life with that blinder still partially on. From what Fest wrote, it seem that Speer suffered from some sort of a self-imposed martyrdom at Nuremberg.<br />Interesting book and well worth the effort to read, I thought I knew Speer a bit better now then before.	2004-06-12

The book proves to be well written and narrative of the battle provides interesting insights and perceptions. The book remains relatively unbias in nature. The author writes critically about leaders of both armies while understanding that sometimes, mistakes happens! The author provides good background material to the battle before and after.<br />I am not sure what the previous reviewer wrote when complaining about lacks of maps.

This book probably belong to that mandatory list of books every Civil War historian should have in his library. Superbly researched, well written and easy to read, its rather amazing how well put together this book happened to be.<br />In case you haven't read the previous reviews, this book is on the Battle of Second Manassas. I used the southern's name here since they won the battle. Its a fantastic retelling of how Robert E. Lee and his troops totally defeated the northern army led by John Pope. This was probably Lee's greatest victory next to Chancellorville although the talent that he was facing had much to be desire. Lee versus Pope, that would be like Joe Montana versus Ryan Leaf in comparison of talent, ablities and leadership. The book generally deals with the leadership of both armies and their consequences.<br />Only thing that really surprised me was that Lee was unable to destroy Pope and only a month later, he suffered defeat at Antietam from the same army he defeated earlier.<br />This book remains the definitive account of this campaign and battle.	2004-06-12

While I thought this book was mildly entertaining and remotely interesting, I thought it was clearly the weakest of the four Dune books I have read so far by the Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. The problems lies in a very sluggish plot and introduction of too many characters that don't do much in the book. It take too long to get things done. The authors would waste couple pages to get a point across when it should be done in couple of paragraphs. The book moves slowly at times and some of the characters' motives are not clear. I mean, why would cymek father allowed his human son other sources of information that directly conflict with his own. And why would that son so readily accepted such views after lifetime of believing in what he was taught. However to add that concept of machine overlord is rather an old one thus making the book feel bit like a retread.<br />But on the other hand, some parts of the book did proves to be nicely done. On the whole though, the deficits of the book outweight the positives. Strictly for die-hard Dune fans only.	2004-06-10

Antonia Fraser made it pretty clear that this Queen of France was probably one of the most misunderstood and most falsely maligned personalities of the French Revolution, accused by her enemies from being a lesbian to a drunkard. While Marie Antoniette was a person of many weaknesses, the author made it clear that outside of her undereducated and immature mind, her spendthrift ways which probably wasn't good for France, Marie Antoniette was none of the things that she was accused of being. Actually in reading this book, I was bit surprised how ordinary and somewhat boring her life was until the last six years before her death.<br />But here's lies the weakness of the book. The book really doesn't go that deep into Marie Antoniette's life during that crucial period. I have read more detail accounts of her life in other books that dealt strictly with the French Revolution then I have in this biography. The book was very good in informing the reader of the pre-French Revolution period of Marie Antoninette's life but faltered afterward. Maybe Antonia Fraser should have stop in 1789 since she really didn't have much to add that wasn't written before by other authors. (Of course, if she did that, it won't be a &quot;complete biography&quot;.)<br />Overall though, this book is well worth any reader's time to read if you have such interest in the life and time of Marie Antoninette. For those who don't read much on the French Revolution, its an excellent choice!  Author's effort to rehabilitate Marie Antoninette's reputation proves to be pretty successful and with certain justice, long overdue.	2004-06-10

After reading all 19 previous reviews on this book, I am spared that I don't have to write any more about the book's details since so much have been written already. Having wrote that, I can say that this book proves to be superbly well written and researched. Its easily readable and its catered even to the casual readers of the American Revolution. George Washington emerged once more as the great American hero and his fellow Americans proves within these pages, as our greatest generation of our national history and I write that with all due respects to Tom Brokow and his somewhat overhype &quot;greatest generation&quot; term he gave to the World War II veterans.<br />But the book isn't without some questionable judgment calls. One previous reviewers wrote that leaving out the deeds of John Honeyman while including some other very questionable events revealed a glaring inconsistency in the author's intent. I wondered why the author did not dig deeper into John Honeyman despite what he regards as &quot;questionable source&quot;.<br />Still, this book will probably replaced Richard M.

This thin book which contains series of essays on how Abraham Lincoln revolutionized our nation during one of the most important periods of our nation proves to be well written and amazingly easy to understand. James McPherson writes clearly how the American Civil War was truly a revolutionary moment in our nation's history and how Lincoln took steps to ensure these changes. How we lived, our political/racial/social norms that are part of our society today took form during the Civil War. Even the way we waged war, have it roots in the Civil War, all have Lincoln's fingerprints all over it.<br />The book proves to be easy to follow and read. But in its simple prose, lies amazing insights and perception of Lincoln's influence during the war and his abilities to effect changes in our nation.

Once more, Sano Ichiro goes forth against all evil to overcome and solved the crime.<br />I think this is a pretty decent book and it could have been better if the main villian wasn't so one dimensional. The Yanagisawa character proves to be very cardboard like in its characterization. Once more, I think that the author's understanding of Tokugawa politics appears to be very limited. Nobody with Yanagisawa's personality and tact as described in the book would last very long in samurai politics. Another thing is that the author seem to think that homosexual politics was paramount within the Tokugawa bakufu. Unfortunately for the author, homosexual activities in Japan was no more and probably no less then those in Europe. Why an all powerful Yanagisawa would ever fear a relatively nobody just because the Shogun seem to be mildy fond of him proves to be totally illogical. Another interesting oversight was the fact that Sano wears a Tokugawa crest when he works. That crest alone, would historically give him almost unlimited powers. No mere police officials would stand in his way or anyone's way if that individual was wearing the Tokugawa crest on his back. It appears that the author seem to be putting artifical elements in her story to created artifical dangers for her hero.<br />While good reading overall, the writing proves to be relatively lightweight in material and plot.	2004-06-07

While the story took certain forgivable liberties with the original Frank Herbert premise, I found it to be within a very acceptable framework.<br />While it would be a mistake to say that this trilogy is just as good as the one written by Frank Herbert, standing on its own merit, Dune House trilogy proves to be pretty entertaining and well told. In all three books, various plot lines were easy followed and they intermixed very nicely within the plot.<br />House Corrino, in my opinion, is probably the weakest of the three books simply because its too pat. The authors have to tied all the loose ends to a fitting conculsion and they probably short changed the plot to make it work. Thus they resorted in changing the premise of the continued story to make everything fit together. For example, I mean, its bit silly that the Bene Gesserit didn't know that the child of Jessica will be a boy. A group that looked into the human species as an exact science should have known such an information of such importance to them far before the birth. After all, we can do that even now!!! In using this case as an example, it shows how the authors artifically created an unrealistic premises within the Dune universe to create a format where they can tied couple of loose ends together. Thus, lies the weakness of the book. (And why the reader of this review should considered my 4 stars to be 3.5).<br />But overall, the book was enjoyable reading and it should satisfied anyone who enjoyed the universe of Frank Herbert....as long as they don't expect the writing and the style to be that of Frank Herbert.	2004-06-06

Perfumed Sleeve was my first Laura Joh Rowland's novel I read, given to me by a friend. I enjoyed the general plot, the writing was smooth and its flow nicely and overall, I liked the characters. As a murder-mystery goes, this book actually impressed me. The investigation, premise and power politics that was moving around the main character, Sano, proves to be a good page turner.<br />However, my major gripes come with historical premise of the book which revealed the author's lack of understanding of Tokugawa politics which lead the story into the realm of historical fantasy instead of fiction. While not to nitpick but these are the list of some of the major errors:<br />  1) The term &quot;elder&quot; was used to described a retired person<br />  from active service, a honorifed title. I think the proper<br />  term the author wanted to use was &quot;Roju&quot;.<br />  2) Just because you are the Shogun's favorite lover boy don't<br />  make you his heir. In fact, in history, such lover boys are<br />  automatically barred from such event.<br />  3) Its sheer silliness to think that a non-Tokugawa like<br />  Yanagisawa could even think that his boy could even be<br />  considered to be the next Shogun.<br />  4) Matsudaira was a name of junior branch of the Tokugawa<br />  Clan. No Shogun, even one as befudded as the one in this<br />  book would promote a member of a very junior branch to<br />  such high position and risk the wrath of the three major<br />  branches of the entire clan....Tokugawa of Owari, Mito and<br />  Kii provinces. Not only that, no man would called the<br />  Shogun &quot;Honored Cousin&quot; in front of everyone, even if that<br />  Shogun was brain dead. Such informality simply don't exist<br />  outside of total privacy between two men.<br />  5) No one in his right mind, will risk destruction of his<br />  house by open warfare. This is sheer fantasy on the<br />  author's part. Doesn't anyone remembered the fate of the<br />  &quot;47 Ronins&quot; story??<br />  6) Finally, the author uses the words &quot;Asakura Jinja Shrine&quot;<br />  couple of times in the book. In English, that would be<br />  &quot;Asakura Shrine Shrine&quot; since the word &quot;Jinja&quot; means<br />  shrine.<br />  7) One last tidbit...in the beginning, the author uses the<br />  words &quot;Shogun&quot; and &quot;dictator&quot; interchangably. A sign of<br />  uneducated historian since an educated one knows of the<br />  massive differences between the two.<br />But in the end, if you accepted the historical fantasy of the book, I thought it was a highly acceptable murder-mystery and despite of my feeling about the author's historical ability, I enjoyed her writing and I am encouraged to read other books of this series.Doesn't anyone remembered the fate of the<BR>      &quot;47 Ronins&quot; story??<BR>   6) Finally, the author uses the words &quot;Asakura Jinja Shrine&quot;<BR>      couple of times in the book.

We should be glad since Frank Herbert lies dead and may he rest in peace. However, it seem clear that many of the 150 or so previous reviewers were looking for Frank Herbert ghola to write more Dune clones.<br />I found both House Atriedes and Harkonnen books to be relatively interesting and fast paced. Its pretty obvious that they were not written by Frank Herbert so why are so many people whining about it. The new series appears to be written in totally different style. But I thought it was pretty well written. There are four different plot lines, Duke Leto's, events on Giedi Prime and House Harkonnen, events on Dune and events with the House Corrino. And of course, them little sisters of the poor. But the book was never confusing and the authors managed to intergrate all the plotlines very nicely. You have to read each book in order to get the most out of them but overall, its an entertaining reading material. Nothing serious and nothing really deep.<br />If someone wrote a spin off series on Middle Earth and people whine that he doesn't write like JRR Tolkien, is there any logic to that? There is only one JRR Tolkien and sadly, there is only one Frank Herbert. I think this series have to judge on its own merit and not on the merit of the original series.	2004-06-05

The research proves to be fine, informative and gives a great insight into this ruler who created England's first oversea empire.<br />The author gives all aspects of Henry's life, his strengths and his weaknesses that mold him into a King that he became in history. Henry's victories and failures were also shown with equal light but I would say that the author handled two great conflicts of Henry's life, his struggles against his wife and family and Henry's battle with Thomas Beckett superbly well.<br />Like most books on this series, it would helped if you had some previous background on the subject period. The book really isn't for a casual reader. The author didn't write this book to be on New York Times best seller list. Its a scholarly work for scholarly minded people. But the book still remains the standard work on Henry II to this day and it has stood the test of time so far.	2004-06-02

Maddicott's biography on Simon de Montfort, I would put this biography as one of the best biographies written for historical figures of this time period. Good thing is, they both compliment each other well.<br />Michael Prestwich's work proves to be superbly researched, highly informative and above all for me, very readable. It does help to have some previous reading on the subject since Edward I had a long career from his teen age years and it kept going until he died. The thick book covers all aspects of Edward's long and colorful life in richness of details and facts.<br />In this book, you will not see Edward Longshank of that movie, Braveheart, which probably did its outmost to ruined the reputation of this great ruler. In this book, the reader will understand why many regards Edward I as one of England's greatest rulers, easily in the top five, maybe the top three!!<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys this subject and had read on this material before. Good background reading would be helpful in getting the most out of this book. Written by a great scholar for other scholars or &quot;scholar want to be&quot;.	2004-06-02

The Russo-Japanese War proves to be one of the more interesting wars ever fought, since it proves to be forebringer of the future, World War I which will be fought nearly ten years later. Trench warfare, superiority of the machine guns on the battlegrounds and meaningless infantry charges were all shown in open light as the Russian and Japanese soldiers fought against each other.<br />The book proves to be well written, nicely researched and revealed a good insight into this war which ironically speaking, isn't too well known in Western nations. A serious student of World War I could see here, that chaotic command structure of the Russian army, had their root initially when they fought against the Japanese. While rarely outnumbered, the Russians were continouesly out-professionalized by their Asian opponents.<br />The war was the first time, a white European power have been brought low by a non-white power since the colonialism began in ernest. A good reading material that comes highly recommended by anyone who got an interest in this subject.	2004-06-02

The author proves to be fair and unbias in his outlook, he justly points out the errors made and personalities of the men and commanders were brought forth with justice.<br />From reading the past reviews, I found that people who tended to favor the southern views, found the book to be objectionable. They don't seem to like the way General John B. Hood was written up. For the rest of the world, General Hood was an utter failure who was probably one of those many generals in Civil War, who was promoted into total incompetency. The southern version of Burnside!! The book make this pretty clear to any reader.<br />Any American who read this book, should read it as an American, not like some neo-Confederate die-hard who still think that Braxton Braggs was a military genius, just like Hood!!!	2004-06-01

I supposed the first question that come to most people's mind when they see this book will be &quot;what in darn hoot was an intendants??&quot; Actually, these intendants were civilian administrators who represented the monarchy within the French military system during this period of time. I supposed in a modern terms, they might be something like Inspector Generals of our army or maybe even a Soviet commissar in their function. Although these intendants were given various duties and functions, their primary role was to be the ears and eyes of the monarchy to whom they report to and represent.<br />The book proves to be quite informative in relating to the functions of this office. The only major drawback lies in that the book isn't that easy to read and the author writes in a very dry and stiff style which will probably bore anyone who wasn't interested in this time period or subject matter. It definitely not for casual reading. It almost like reading a textbook!! If given a chance, I would have rated this book as 3.5 stars but gave it a four because its an informative book on a rare military subject matter.	2004-05-27

While initially successful, he allowed that success to go to his head and he was finally defeated and killed.<br />The book revealed a highly complex character, its superbly researched, readable to a those who knoweledge of the period is pretty good, bit hard on those who may be entering this subject for the first time. The author managed to intergrate all elements of de Montfort's life, as a great soldier, as a politican, a man of God with a look of idealism and above all, a family man. Along with his strengths, lies his weaknesses, his ruthless ambition, self-centered on family promotion and wealth at expense of others and his overwhelming sense of pride that borderline on sheer arrogance. The book clearly show how his strength gained him his victories while his weaknesses sent him into defeat.<br />With great insight, perception and scholarship, I would say this biography of Mountfort is probably the best on the subject and one of the best on any mediveal personalities of the time period. (Although Michael Prestwich's biography on Edward I is also quite excellent.)	2004-05-27

It revealed an Emperor who was not only very able but also quite ruthless. Being the first Emperor from Africa revealed how international the Roman Empire truly was back then. The book provides good material on this Emperor's life, his background and background of where he originated from. Its a must read for anyone who happen to be interested in this subject matter.<br />However, its not really for casual readers. The writing proves to be bit on the dry side and although the book packed with information, the story doesn't flow as well as it should. It had a dry textbook type of feel to it. If it wasn't for that, the book probably does deserved the five stars that other reviewers have awarded it.	2004-05-14

TR's muliti-complex personality and behavior proves to be a impossible task for many historians to grasp but Kathleen Dalton make it look pretty easy.<br />The author ensure that there was nothing simple or sternotypical about Theodore Roosevelt. In many ways, her work is quite comparable with Edmund Morris' work on TR although one author emphsis more on one subject matter compared to the other one.<br />A must read book for anyone interested in the life and time of Theodore Roosevelt.	2004-05-06

Its was generally written for the casual reader type so the writting proves to be clear, and it was pretty well researched from the western point of view. But since the book was written from that perception, I have no problem not having the Chinese view on the situation.<br />I would say this book is a very good introductory effort for any reader who are interested in this subject. There are other books, far more in-depth in nature that can fulfilled further study if needed.	2004-04-16

I believed certain parts have been rewritten to insert the reference to Mel Gibson's Braveheart movie which put the character, William Wallace into the forefront of Scottish history for many people.<br />The biography on the whole, I thought to be very balance, very detail and superbly written within the context of time period. The author obviously understand his character within the boundary of that time period and this keep the biography honest and unbiased. I have read several Wallace biographies since that movie and I have to say this one is probably the best one. Good thing is that this book came out way before the movie so it doesn't have that taint of cashing in on the movie feel.	2004-04-16

This well researched and nicely written book traces the combat activities of every single infantry brigade that fought at the Battle of Gettysburg. Each entree got a brief background of how the brigade developed prior to the battle and then go into considerable detail in what the brigade did during the Battle of Gettysburg. It also reflected on how much they lost and how they performed.<br />The book was written to supplement Larry Tagg's Generals of Gettysburg and it does the job well. The book covers only infantry units, artillery and cavalry units were not included, maybe it might be for later volumes.<br />The book, although written with certain level of clarity, was not really written for the casual reader. Anyone who read this book should have a very firm understanding of Battle of Gettysburg or else, they would have problem following the narrative. But for serious student, this book provides in-depth reviews of brigade level command which would be useful in understanding the battle.	2004-04-12

The book does a wonderful job contrasting the theocratic values of the Mormon's ideal world to the republican ideology of the United States at that time.<br />The key figure of this book proves to be the theocratic dictator of Utah Territory, Brigham Young, prophet and president of the LDS. Its pretty clear by the book that Young saved his church from destruction and with his single-minded clarity of mission, managed to saved Utah for the Mormons. But in doing so, he committed himself to unforgivable sins, worst being the cover-up of the Mountain Meadow Massacre. But it was also interesting how he created a shadow government to off set the loss of formal position. But to paraphase one of the quotes from the book, &quot;I may be the governor of the territory but Young is the govenor of the people&quot; (close?). His defense of polygamy aided the enemies of his church and his willingness to over looked the misdeeds of his underlings marked him as a great but deeply flawed man. The book covered this struggled between Young and all his foes who stood against his theocratic dictatorship.<br />The book appears to be very well researched, clearly written and easy to read. Its an interesting read of Utah's politics, wars and religious conflicts as the Mormons slowly but surely, began to assimulated into the American society.	2004-04-12

Well, I think I read enough praises of this book from reading all the past reviews written prior to this one. I supposed another one probably won't hurt. And I am sure that some other person will come along after me to say the same thing.<br />So having got that off my chest, I would say without a doubt that this book is probably the most readable biography on Eleanor of Aquitaine you will probably ever read. Its not only the most readable but its probably one of the best (although I enjoyed Amy Kelly's book just as much). The book was well written and with honesty, without much bias although it was pretty clear that Weir admired her subject. I liked that Weir tries to cut through many of the mediveal bias against Eleanor, especially on the Rosamund la Clifford affair. Only real complaint I would have is that its need more maps - for the casual readers whose knowledge of mediveal European geography may be lacking.<br />But no one can go wrong reading this book and enjoying it at the same time.	2004-04-08

Davout to life in a well written, superbly researched and very insightful biography. The author managed to intergated all facets of Davout's life into a single flow that provides clarity and understanding. The two previous reviews have spoken more then enough on this book so I won't go on. It was nice to read a great biography which did great justice on Napoleon's greatest corps commander (my humble opinion of course).	2004-04-08

This biography will probably ranked in my book, one of the best on Eleanor of Aquitaine next to the one written by Alison Weir. While Weir's book is far more readable, Kelly's book sides with a more scholarly approach. This book wasn't meant for the casual reader but for serious mediveal history readers. With that in mind, I thought the book was well written, superbly researched and provides a great deal of insights as well as cause and effects of Eleanor's presence in history.<br />If you are serious about understanding Eleanor of Aquitaine, I would strongly recommended this book and the one by Weir as the two books that will covered her life with justice and with completeness.	2004-04-08

I can say that people who wrote badly about this book probably didn't read it very well or didn't read it at all.<br />No one can start off his Napoleonic studies without reading this book. David Chandler's book is the fundamental book in understanding Napoleon and his military career. One of the previous reviewers stated that Military History and Atlas of Napoleonic Wars was better. That should be corrected in my opinion. The latter book provides a great companion book to David Chanlder's work but it lack the depth and understanding of the Napoleon's campaigns as described by Chandler.<br />I kind of considered Chandler's book as a sort of Napoleonic bible, bit overzealous maybe but this book is where most serious students of Napoleon's military campaigns should start. Most who do will not need to buy another book that covers Napoleon's entire military career. They can spend their hard earn money buying books on Napoleon's individual campaigns, battles, personalities and naval warfare.	2004-04-08

I personally thought the book was well written, very informative about the character of the war, problems and individuals that make up the Rough Riders and Roosevelt's own take on the war. I am pretty sure that Teddy didn't write this book just for history. He had politics in mind when he wrote it and he made sure that he was at the center of the universe in his own book. Actually, there isn't nothing wrong with that since the book reads well and Roosevelt was generous with his praises toward many people. Teddy was also quite insightful in his observations of the way our military campaign in Cuba was being handled. It was clear that he did care a lot about his men and took his responsiblity seriously. A good reading material on the Spanish American War even with the pro-Teddy bias, you can't help but to be entertained by it.	2004-04-07

I found this book to be quite entertaining and informative look at people who executed other people in the name of the law. The book centered more or less around British justice system. In more ways then one, these executioners tries to be as professional as possible in their crafts. The author goes back to the mediveal period to the current time in telling accounts of how executions were done and conducted. Stories like one of James Barry (a hangman) who came up with a chart of how far a man should drop before his neck breaks on the knotted rope based on the body weight revealed that some people tries to make serious work out of their job.<br />The author writes with clarity and the book appears to be well researched. I supposed the author tries to insert an political anti-capital punishment bias into this book but I thought the effort was partially defeated because the book showed how capital punishment if properly applied, works! (Meaning, murderers don't killed again after they were hung!!) After that read this book, I was more for capital punishment then before.	2004-04-07

The book traces the Church's history from the beginning and how they interacted with other sectors of American society as they grew and expanded. The author's premise was that the LDS was part of the America's growing pain during this period (1830-1846). The author maintained that Mormons remains true to the concepts of the Republic even although they were leaning toward theocracy. The book was well written, appears to be well researched and the author maintained an even approach while exploring his premise. Its a good book, quite insightful and should be read by anyone interested in Mormon history.	2004-04-05

The reviewer from Southern California on 26 Sept 2001 make an interesting statement that FDR knew from intercepted dipomatic message that Germany will declared war on US when Japan attacked the United States. Funny that I didn't see that in the book anywhere and for sure, its not in the index. I wondered where that reviewer got his information since I never heard of it. If such thing were true, then FDR may had a case for covering up and allowing the Japanese to attacked.<br />But since I haven't seen it on paper yet, I have to go along with the fact that if FDR wanted a war with Germany, Japan would be the last source. Did FDR knew that Germany would declared war on US? Did FDR knew that Hitler would make such a stupid blunder that will caused Germany repeat the mistakes of 1917 and if so, how come no one has written about such foresight? Becuase if all the answers to these questions are \\"NO\\", then this book don't have a purpose despite of all the nice writing and evidences provided by the author. Without war with Germany, there was no sense in having war with Japan, in fact that would be the exact opposite of what FDR wanted!! Japan's alliance with Germany did not gurantee Germany's declaration since such alliance was of a defensive nature. Why would anyone think that FDR wanted a war with Japan without Germany? If there is an evidence of prior knowledge that Germany will entered the war against the United States with Japan, I would like to know about it. That would be a real conspiracy worth reading about. But I doubt that the Japanese dipomatic corps knew anything about Pearl Harbor planning while Germany was still kind of hoping that Japan would help them against the Russians. But this book does not show such revealing evidence and in the end, its all second guessing, hindsight analysis and conjectures based on very good research but pointless without the real prize.	2004-04-05

I discovered this book to be most excellent in terms of recounting the Texas Revolution. The book proves to be superbly written, researched and you can read it in clarity despite of the details of information, data and personalities involves. Hardin's narrative of the Alamo proves to be quite excellent (see the Osprey's book Campaign 89 for Hardin's indepth look) and the way he goes about retelling the horror stories of Texians' blunders make it hard for the reader like me to realized how victory over the Mexicans could have been achieved. But Texians did win but according to Hardin, no thanks to Sam Houston. I guess this was where I wondered if Hardin's crusade went bit overboard. The author totally despised Sam Houston and its shows in his book. From the pages, it looked like the Texians won despite of the best efforts of Sam Houston. Didn't Houston do anything right in 1836??<br />Still, this is a great book, a standard on the subject for some times to come.	2004-04-05

The authors tries to traced the cause and effects of development of modern weapon systems within the British army and how its affected its performances during these years. There seem to be a strong leaning toward artillery as one of its main subject matters. The book also showed how these new weapon systems altered British concepts of war, campaign, battle and tactics as the British army went from a &quot;horse and foot&quot; army to a modern mechanized army. I thought the book was well organized, researched and written.<br />However, having said that, I don't think this is a book for a casual reader. The pacing is bit dry and reading material seem to be geared for die-hard military history readers. I am not sure that the price offered by Amazon can be considered to be very reasonable either. I brought my copy ten years ago used for ten bucks. Its an in-depth book but not worth $300!!!	2004-04-04

I thought this book was well written, research and quite interesting. The book was written without much bias and accounts from both sides were taken into consideration. Like the previous reviewer, I didn't understand why Mr. Duffy didn't go into Battle of Berlin which was the crowning jewel of the Soviet offensives which ended the war. I guess Antony Beevor's work have to covered that end. The book come highly recommended for anyone interested in the final months of the Third Reich along the eastern front.	2004-04-04

Actually, against my better taste, I enjoyed reading this book. However, I thought Threadwell was smoking something funny as his behavior seem to be so dangerous. The author was mauled and eaten by a bear in Alaska last October 2003 and the book seem to show why. He seem to treat bears like people but he forgot that like people, bears can go good, indifferent or bad. Ironically, just like its very dangerous for bears to lose their fear of humans, its equally dangerous for a man to lose his fear of the bear. The book clearly shows that Threadwell slowly overcoming his fear of bears (although he remains wary) and actually feeling comfortable around them as the pages turned. That can be considered as a bad move, arrogant and presumptuous. Threadwell also seem to mistaken bears' tolerance for him as some sort of a mystic connection. He began to treat these bears as if they were his personal wild pets, giving them names and intruding into their space. Such behavior only works while the bears were amazingly tolerant of Threadwell's presence. Although he had many close calls, it wasn't enough to bring caution into his mind. Despite of his obvious love of bears and fear that one of them might get kill because of him, Threadwell didn't seem to mind that he put himself in harm's way. Although Threadwell stated that he don't mind being bear fodder, he obviously fought back hard if the newspaper accounts were correct when he was about to become the next afternoon snack. The book also seem to revealed Threadwell's obession with proachers and all that although Threadwell don't go into any kind of details. I was left with an impression that maybe the author took some liberties while writing this book.	2004-04-03

The author present his material with certain level of clarity and insights that make this book a sure fire winner.<br />Luckily, the author does not malingered over the political correctness of the war as we see it today. The Mexican War cost Mexico any chance she had in becoming a dominate power in North America. That role went to the United States for better or for worst. As an American, I would say, for the better!!<br />The author also wrote with amazing sense of objectively regarding many of the major characters of the war, from Winfield Scott to Santa Anna.<br />If there was one book to read on the subject, I would recommended this one.	2004-03-19

I was bit surprised to find this book on the bargain bin at Barnes and Noble since the book proves to be quite excellent in portarying events surrounding the events at Charleston, South Carolina and attack on Fort Sumter. Key figure, Major Robert Anderson comes alive in this book as he toed the thin line between war and peace - a line that was getting thinner by the day.<br />The book proves to be well written, well researched and provides interesting insights into the mindset of situation at hand. I didn't see any obvious bias toward any sides although the author appears to be bit disappointed in Lincoln's initial behavior toward Anderson while forgetting under what conditions Lincoln was in when he initially took power.<br />Anyway, if you are interested in the Civil War and able to get this book such reduced price, it would be foolish not to buy it since the book is worth the price even at its original sticker.	2004-03-17

The transcripts of Hitler's military conferences might be interesting for selective folks who got a lot of military history background on World War II but for majority of casual readers out there, the book would make a better pillow then a reading material. (some of materials were released in other publications but this book claims to have it all.)<br />Having said that, for folks like me who do have good background on World War II, I found the book to be quite interesting and bit annoying. Like the previous reviewer, I was bit taken back by the fact that some of the most interesting conferences were not there and it was hard to assess the mood of the people at those conferences. It was plain amazing how trivial Hitler got in these conferences. I don't think no other commander-in-chief during that war ever got so micro-managing as Hitler got as the book showed. Of course, some part of the book was rather slow but it was interesting to see who was the toady and who wasn't at these conferences. Its a thick book and not very fast reading material. But for hard core World War II reader, this book should be read.	2004-03-16

Lee which exactly don't make it a very good biography if the author was too much in love with his subject. Certain sense of objectivity goes out the window. It doesn't helped that the author proves to be rather pro-southern in outlook which heavily tainted his approach. The book read very well though but much of the author's work sounds very dated compared to the newer works on Lee - that reduced Lee into something more human. I think authors like Clifford Dowdey seem to be outdated as the Civil War moves into a more objective outlook.	2004-03-11

I think some of the previous reviewers were looking for a military biography. But book talks more about Lee as a man instead of Lee as a military commander. On that, I found the book to be rather refreshing in outlook as the author intregated Lee's personal life into his military performances.<br />The author appears to be pretty sympathetic toward Lee, as a man with many problems at home before, during and after the Civil War. He writes with clarity and with empathy which helped the reader understand what sort of a man Lee was. While an analyical look, I found the book readable, enlightening and well presented.	2004-03-11

Some of the material have been retold already but the author writes with certain amount of clarity. Starkey made sure that the reader understand that Elizabeth had a relatively good childhood, a wealthy landowner even before she became a Queen and her powers were quite considerable, probably enough for her half-sister Mary to take into account. This proves to be a very readable book and gives us a good understanding of Elizabeth's early life and how it helped shape her as a Queen of England.	2004-03-09

This book by Anthony Arthur proves to be one of the more unusual book on the Anabapist kingdom of Munster that existed from 1534-35. Considered as a heretical kingdom by both Catholic and Protestant movements, the city went through a year and a half siege before finally falling to their enemies. During that time, this Dutch tailor became a self-proclaim king who ruled the city with an iron hand. From the author's writing, its pretty clear that this fellow was pretty psychotic and the entire situtation reminded me of what happened in Waco, Texas back in the 1990s. An interesting reading material all the way....	2004-03-09

I don't expect consistancy under these conditions and expect more diverse opinions and facts relating to the matter at hand. Each essay covered certain part of the long conflict that engulfed the British Isles between 1638-1660.<br />The book comes well armed with maps, illstrations and I thought it was quite readable. Anyone who read this book should have a decent background reading on the English Civil War prior since you will be reading an essay which don't give you much introduction space.	2004-03-09

Wert's book proves to be well written, nicely researched and very readable. But I think Wert feel bit too sympathetic toward his subject, mildly whitewashing many of Custer's gross sins both as a man and as a commander. Outside of that, the book doesn't add much to the Custer lore. For novice Custer reader this would be a good start (first of many). For veteran Custer reader, it won't add much more then what you already know so you can let your money make your decision on if this book is worth your while.	2004-03-07

I thought this was a well written, easy to read and utterly interesting book on the archeological research done around the Custer Battlefield (Little Big Horn Battlefield for the politically correct). The book centered around the common soldiers of the Seventh Cavalry instead of its more infamous commander. The study of human remains helped give a &quot;slice of life&quot; look at the regular cavalrymen of the Seventh Cavalry and how the battle went according to archeological finds of bullets, casing and where the men of Seventh fell during the battle. It was also interesting to read about how they tried to identified some of the remains they found. The book should be consider as a mandatory reading material for anyone interested in the battle of Little Bighorn.	2004-03-07

In a clear and well written style with good insights into his main character, Jeffry Wert did great justice to a man who was totally misunderstood during much of the latter half of the 19th century and at least during the first half of 20th century. In clearing up Longstreet's name, Wert restored an element of Civil War history back on its rightful place. Wert believes that Longstreet was the finest corps commander Lee ever had (and better then any Union corps commanders). That is a bold statement which will be debated by many. The biography was geared more toward Longstreet's military career then his personal one and although the book proves to be filled with information, its all easily consumable by a causal reader. A must have book for any Civil War library.	2004-03-07

The author skillfully tries to understand how two men could have committed such murders under God as they see it and what mind set such thoughts evolved from. He does this by tracing the history of polygamy within the Mormon church and how such practice created a cause and effect within the church that still lies deep within itself today. I won't considered this book to be &quot;anti-Mormon&quot; or anything like that since the author does not go around bashing Mormons. But the history of the Mormon church is not perfect and much imperfection of that history can usually be traced back to their practice of polygamy during much of the 19th century (that imperfection usually began with Joseph Smith himself who founded the church) and how that practice remains one of the controversial issues even today - especially among the Mormon Fundamentalists who seem to pick and choose their callings from God.<br />I thought this was a well-written book, nicely researched and it doesn't bogged the reader down with petty details. Its may be considered as a clear condemnation of the Mormon Fundamentalists whose belief the author clearly believes to be in the wrong.	2004-03-05

I considered this book to be one of the more readable and well researched books surrounding the Shenandoah Valley campaign of 1864. The book centered around the Battle of Cedar Creek where Phil Sheridan lost and won a battle all in one day. That left poor Jubal Early as the man who won and lost the same battle in the single day. The book was well written and very easy to consumed. It was generally geared for the public consumption since nearly half of the book was geared toward giving background information prior to the battle itself. Of 350 pages of printed narrative, only 150 dealt with the battle itself. It has a nice order of the battle but I wished there were some strength numbers to go with it. But overall, its intersting book with many things to say. The author is clearly very familiar with the subject matter and that ease make this book quite a fast reader despite of the details he provides.	2004-02-28

Everything from his psycho-analysis works to his family life, Jewish background to the political climate that surrounded his life were all integrated in this book in one massive volume. The book proves to be well written and relatively objective in outlook as the author maintain an even kneel toward his subject. I found the book to be quite informative and full of interesting insights on Freud's motives and actions.<br />It seem to the author that Freud's life really didn't start until he published his famous book, Interpretation of Dreams. Roughly a hundred pages covered his life prior to that and rest of 550 pages covered his life after that. There is another 150 pages of source materials and index just to let you know how thick this book can be. (Hardback)<br />It should be warned that due to an overwhelming amount of information provided in this book, most of the first time readers into Freud's life would probably suffer from information overload. Many of the technical terms used in Freud's work were not meant for casual readers. This biography is quite complex in nature and content. I would recommend reading couple of shorter and simpler biographies on Freud before moving up to this book. If not, you will just slog through this book like being stuck in a giant swamp of information.	2004-02-22

Led by General Jubal Early, the Confederate forces came pretty close to success and the authors were correct in saying that even if the occupation of Union capitol would only be momentary, the political and morale cost would be devastating for the north. While hindsight make this campaign almost a sideshow, the book revealed how close it really was to being a main event.	2004-02-21

This biography I thought, was pretty good work on Germany's most famous general (at least to the west). Irving's research proves to be quite good, its well written and very readable.

General Halleck have not been well regarded by most Civil War historians since the Civil War. This short biography (90% of 212 pages of text are on his Civil War years) by Stephen Ambrose tries to take a revisionist tack to Hallack's accomplishments, talents and his contribution to the Union cause. Ambrose's effort was to show that Halleck was bit more then just a paper general but an effective organizer and coordinator of the Union war effort. While admitting that Hallack was no battlefield general, his massive intellect on military matter was more suited for support roles to the armies at front, a classical bookworm general.<br />The book was originally published back in 1962 so the writing may not be as good as Ambrose's later efforts. But its still nicely readable and provides some very insightful views on Halleck's role in the Civil War. Whether you agree with Ambrose or not, is up to you.	2004-02-19

The amount of complaining, whining and sniveling in this book was simply astonishing. Never been a solider and least of all, a Marine, but is this a normal mental attitude? Do all Marines complains, whined and sniveled as this one did??<br />For the &quot;battlefield&quot; memoir of the 1991 Gulf War, the book is rather tame. Sure, the writing is blunt but mostly he seem to be venting. Maybe this was the way the author is treating his anger management problem. I wondered as I read this book if Swofford forgot that the Marines was an all-volunteer forces since it he seem to give a picture that he was an inmate in some brutal Stalinist gulag.<br />This is not to say that there were interesting spots along the book. There were and some parts of the book was actually quite interesting to know. But if Swofford and many of the reviewers before me thinks that writing a story of Marine who sounds like an unit crybaby make this a good book, I wondered how the Iraqis lost....?	2004-02-19

While Pride of Lions proves to be very readable and somewhat interesting book, I thought it was pretty lightweight material and it really wasn't that exciting as Lion of Ireland. I supposed there were few good spots but overall, the book slogs through the story.<br />I think the weakness lies in the length. My paperback version got only 395 pages. This story needs more. But what this story really need was a character, interesting, heroic and true and to be honest, the lead character Donough really don't fit the mode.<br />While I enjoyed Lion of Ireland, this follow-up book falls short.

This biography of Patrick Cleburne proves to be very readable and insightful. The book appears to be well researched and its obviously that the author favored his subject.<br />Cleburne appears to be a very controversial even while he was alive. Perhaps because of his foreign birth, he was more sympathic about the conditions of the blacks and made proposals that didn't go well with his fellow southerners. The book revealed that he was a superb leader and intelligent commander. His superiors definitely didn't aid their cause by keeping him just as a divison commander when he could have been an excellent corps commander - in an army where corps commanders were not well regraded.<br />The author painted a vivid and complete picture of this general whose reputation have grown considerably since the Civil War among all Civil War readers.	2004-02-19

Despite of the misleading title, I found this book to be quite engrossing and I read it compulsively from cover to cover in a single sitting. The book is different from other climbing books because it deals with medical part of the climb which is not often about making it to the summit but in saving lives. Dr. Kamler writes extremely well and this will be one book that you will read to finish. Like one reviewer before me stated, I was bit disappointed when the book ended.<br />The misleading title refered to the fact that I thought the book was more or less about that 1996 Everest climbing season that took so many lives. That section only took up a small portion of the book. Much of the book involves his other expeditions up to Everest. While not boring reading material, like most I probably expected more on that 1996 climbing season.	2004-02-19

In some ways, the book almost read like the history of Iditarod and as the founder of Coldfoot, Mackey probably won his place in Alaska history. I regards this more like public autobiography because Mackey mostly relates to his public life. What seem to be missing are stuff about his personal life outside of few mentions of his kids and his three wives. It would be bit more interesting to know the man behind his accomplishments and the cost.<br />But overall, I highly recommended this book about an extraordinary Alaskan who did extraordinary things. As a fellow Alaskan, I hope there will be more chapters to come.	2004-02-18

The book tells the story of this great Alaskan musher in an easy to read and entertaining prose.<br />However, as information goes, the book suffered because while the author tells us so much about Attla's accomplishments, the book doesn't go into the man itself. Its a very friendly biography written by the author who does his best not to paint any negative aspects of George Attla. A good example would the short time Mr. Attla spent in jail up in Fairbanks for reason Mr. Freedman should have known but did not go into.<br />Biography is a two edge sword. If you are going to write about a man, his greatness and his flaws must be presented. So far, the author seem to be high with praises only. How will we supposed to know who George Attla is without his weaknesses as well. Because of this, I can only considered this book as &quot;half biography&quot; of George Attla, entertaining reading but pretty lightweight material.	2004-02-18

I brought this book at Pea Ridge National Battlefield and read while I was at the park and immediately afterward. I found the book to be superbly written, insightful and well researched. Its also a pretty entertaining book. While packed with information about the battle, the book never weighted you down and the authors keep the pace going until the very end. I enjoyed reading the book while sitting at the actual location which gave me some very insightful understanding of how the battle went. This book will probably stand the test of time as a standard book for this battle for the current generation and maybe beyond.	2004-02-18

However, the book seem to be geared around his public life and his involvment with the Civil Rights movement of SCLC. Although this part of his life seem to be well documented and covered, the book don't tell us much about King's private life, his relationship with his family, or his sexual indiscretions and his own relationship on the personal level with so many of his fellowers, friends and rivials.<br />But its a superb coverage of King's Civil Rights involvement and actually tell a sad story of man who was definitely over reaching the limits of his own personal, mental and physical endurance. A good example would be how MLK's venture in the Vietnam War which definitely overextended his reach when so much still needed to be done on the Civil Rights front. This distraction also cost him friends and allies who could have helped him on that issue which should have been the main focus of MLK. I guess he lost focus in the end. I am bit surprised that the book didn't make any commentary on the legacy of MLK or anything like that. The book stopped with his death which almost sound like a blessing for MLK who seem at the end of his life, an unhappy man, totally stress out and  overwhelmed by his burdens.<br />But as biography goes, I thought this book was honest and interesting picture of a man. And thats good in my opinion, MLK was a man with combination of greatness and flaw that the book clearly points out with a great deal of objectivity. I thought it was kind of an ironic statement when the author stated that the only people who really knew MLK were his closest friends and the FBI who wiretapped him.<br />I should note that this may not be an ideal chocie for first time reader of MLK since there are overwhelming amount of material in this book which may create an information overload for some people.<br />My paperback book didn't have any photos which I thought to be bit strange. Book like this need photos. But overall, this is the best biography I have read on MLK regarding his public life. Will there ever be one of his private life??perback book didn't have any photos which I thought to be bit strange. Book like this need photos.

I found this book to be pretty interesting but I wondered if the author was really stating the obvious here. Cemetary Hill according to the author, was the real objective of Robert E. Lee's plans during the three days at Gettysburg. I don't think that itself was any great discovery on it own. Anyone with any knowledge of the battle would know this as I did for a super long time since it don't take much to read a map of the battle. Why is this so? Well, as the author clearly pointed out, Cemetary Hill is one of the major keys to the Union position. Capture of it would be a key to winning the battle. No great mystery here.<br />The book goes on to describe how Lee planned this battle to support this thesis. While I do not debate the central concept, I think the author overstates his case when he focus too narrowly on Cemetary Hill. After all, Lee's deployments and movements during the battle tells us that while he was aiming for Cemetary Hill as his ultimate target, he had other ways of getting there. The author dismissal of Little Round Top appears too casual. Of course he says this because he wondered how the Confederates can benefit from capturing Little Round Top with Union Sixth Corps so closed by. Of course, Lee didn't know that but the author does. This sound bit self-serving. The author often dismissed many accounts because they were made in hindsight after the fact, he too make too much assumptions of his own based on hindsight after the fact. Not only that, I don't think author's idea that Longstreet on the second day would advanced toward Cemetary Hill from his starting position to be very practical even if Union III Corps stay where it was supposed to be.<br />The book is not very strong when it deals with Pickett's charge. There seem to a lot of guessing and conjectures here over where the charge was to hit home. The idea that once the Confederate forces broke the Union lines, it will roll up the Union lines toward Cemetary Hill sound bit like a fantasy scenario considering all the reserves Union army had which will prevent such manuvers.<br />As any commander would say, any plan is worthless once contact is made with the enemy. I think what may defeat this book in the end will be the actual deployment, movements and attacks of the Army of Northern Virginia which historians will see as Lee's actual plans at work.cenario considering all the reserves Union army had which will prevent such manuvers.<br />As any commander would say, any plan is worthless once contact is made with the enemy.

All the major battles fought between the British and Germans are clearly written and describes here as well as some of the more interesting characters of the naval scenes. The author appears to be firmly in John Jellicoe's camp. Although at first look, it might be a general history of war at sea, its not. This is more or less, a strict view from the British point of view with a few German bones tossed in. French naval activities are almost non-existence in this book.<br />I think I read in one of the previous reviews about lack of maps. This I think is one of the major weaknesses of this book. Author is now writing military history book instead of policy oriented book of Dreadnought. In military books, you need to have maps of battles you are writing about. Somehow, I think Mr. Massie missed the ship on this one. It would have been nice if he included more photos as well, photos of men and ships that he was writing about.<br />But overall, I found this book to be a great read and lucky of me, I do have other sources in my library that got the maps and photos. While I don't think reading Dreadnought is a mandatory thing before reading Castles of Steel, it would probably helped greatly if people did read Dreadnought first. The author provides interesting insights and the book proves to be well written and researched.	2004-02-16

This book was written before that one so I expected the same and was not disappointed. Many of these stories get told 45-50 years after the fact, memories may fade but experiences and understanding of combat does not. Once more, this book collects a short set of stories as told by the veterans of their combat experiences. The stories were short but honest and with far more insight then most World War II movies put together. Some of them come with a late hour confessions of killing of enemy POWs or wounded enemy, some time in the heat of battle, some time out of need for survival. One man even kept photos of the three dead Germans from their paybooks. Maybe some of the more negative reviews didn't like that, after all it was more comfortable to know that ONLY Germans and Japanese troop were the ones that murdered POWs and shoot defenseless wounded soldiers. Shocking that we Americans did something like that in war. (It also allowed me to have a new perception whenever I read about enemy soldiers shooting American POWs or woundeds in battle...maybe they felt anger and hatred toward the Americans who were killing their buddies, comrades and mentors. Who say war was fair, eh?)<br />The book is written in a very readable form, its well organized and quality of the stories varies in details. But you will get a good slice of understanding of what it may be like, to be a soldier in war. Reading a book like this may also give an understanding that soldiers of other nations, even our enemies may have gone through the same experience.	2004-02-15

I think the Soviet defeat in Operation Star can equal this debacle that helped the Germans restored stability after their own disaster at Stalingrad. The book was well written and researched. The narrative was easy to follow and author gives good deal of insights on Zhukov's motivations behind his purpose. The book clearly revealed some fundamental weaknesses within the Soviet command while reflecting in some part, the strength of the Germans. Although I understand that the author wanted to give a the Soviet view on this matter, but if Zhukov lost the battle, Model won it and he probably deserves equal coverage. I do have one major complaint and that referred to the maps, while its clear enough, I thought the movements of units were not very clear and he should have used the standard NATO symbols to clarified the position instead of just writing a meshmash of lettering and numbers that designated units. It made a complex picture just more confusing when he didn't have to.<br />I also thought that the book was a textbook example of how the Germans could have fought the Soviets after Stalingrad. If the Germans decided against the Kursk campaign, battle like this would have been a good example of how the Germans could have outlast the Russians along the eastern front. Powerful mobile reserves, flexible command structure and capable leadership, post Stalingrad period would have been not a sure thing for the Soviets.<br />This is a book written for people who already got background education on the Eastern Front. Author don't waste a lot pages trying to explain what been going on since Barbarossa began and almost immediately plunge the reader into the conception and realization of Operation Mars and its relations.	2004-02-14

But this well written and easy to read biography, the author showed the Louis XIII was an equal if not a controlling element of a partnership that grew between him and Cardinal Richelieu. Through both men, France grew and became the next European super power. People of France suffered for that growth and men like Richelieu were often damned by later history as villians and monsters (Three Musketeers book for example). What was so interesting about this biography was the author make it so clear how politically and personally acute Louis XIII was in the first place. His support of Richelieu, during good times and bad, revealed a highly focus and mature mind. While his personality wasn't anything to bragged about, his quirks and eccentic behavior can be overlooked as long as he had his eye on the ball and kept on going. A book written with great insight, understanding and nicely researched, I am sure it will be a bit before this book will be surpassed.	2004-02-12

Each name got a short biographical or career notes attached next to them. However, not all names were not treated equal. The more famous or important names got a longer biographical/career notes while the lesser names only have one or two sentences after them. A good example would be that Admiral Yamamoto, who planned the Pearl Harbor attack got nearly three pages of biographical/career note while Lt. General Reizo Kato got only one short sentence telling us that he commanded the 28th Division in Manchuria from Oct. 1943. Poor General Kato, if it wasn't for this book, he would be forgotten completely by American historians!!!<br />An reference book that make it an interesting thumb reading material. The coverage isn't as complete as you might hope but there isn't too many books I know in the English language that got information like this between the two covers.	2004-02-12

This proves to be an interesting book about Japanese-American battalion that drove to saved another American battalion while at the same time, there was a German battalion which also cut off as well. Its an interesting story and since there isn't too many books out there dealing with the Japanese-American units, this book proves to be quite informative. The book also look at things from the German perception as well and their experiences which was much more bitter then the American &quot;Lost Battalion&quot;.<br />However, I also wished that the book was written better.

I think many reviewers didn't read the subtitle of the book, &quot;Lives and Films of.....&quot; I don't think this book was meant to be a complete kiss and tell biography of Kurosawa and Mifune, this is a book which chronicled their cooperative efforts together in making films that became great classics and their relationship with and against each other. This is a book on relationship between two giants of the Japanese film industry. It was not meant to be a total biography as so many reviewers seem to have wanted.<br />The book gives very good background material to both men but its always about the relationship between the two. After both men split up after Red Beard, the author took pains to how see each one of them dealt with their careers afterward. Kurosawa continued to have success while Mifune drifted into period films, TV shows and his achievements suffered greatly. The book also gives a great understanding on how Japanese film industry worked, how it declined and basically how it fell apart in the face of Hollywood. Even the author expressed mixed surprised how waves of American films in a foreign nation like Japan, completely converted the Japanese audience into their own as they abandoned their own film industries into Third World status.<br />I thought the book was well written, well researched and explained the relationship and the films made by both Kurosawa and Mifune. But for anyone looking for a true biography, look some place else, for film historians like myself, this book is a must read.	2004-02-12

The book does more then relates the stories of the Japanese-American combat units but also go into other fields that these folks went into which proves to highly useful and valuable in the war effort. Serving as translators, working in military intelligence service and working on propagranda were all important duties served by the Japanese-American soldiers who often had to fight this war on two fronts....the enemies and their own side.

However, she does certain amount of justice to the cause and I found her perception as an \\"outsider\\" looking in to be interesting. Her observations appears to be objective and fair. The book apparently seem to be written in two levels. In one level, she tells about her experiences personally while she worked as teacher in one of these relocation camps, Poston. Then at a next level, she basically tell the history of Japanese-American internment process and its aftermath. She is obviously very sympathetic toward the Japanese-Americans who she believed were treated unjustly.<br />Overall, this book isn't very thick but I thought I gave a good insight of an experiences inside of these internment camps through a fair and objective pair of eyes. It may be that she was in a perfect position to observed all that, without getting too close to the matter at hand.	2004-02-12

The book not only informed the reader about the policies and works of the two great leaders of France during this period but how their actions affected the people of France, her cultures, her friends and enemies abroad. Book of monumental study, it proves to be highly readable and while I have no knowledge of the French language, I can't complaint about the writing or the translation. This book clearly showed that when Richelieu became the Chief Minister of France, that nation was on a verge of becoming another Holy Roman Empire, weak, divided and a non-factor. But in partnership with his King, who realized a good thing when he saw it, by the time both men were dead, France was on a verge of becoming a next European superpower, replacing her old rivial Spain. But the cost of such move, was heavy on the French people. The book wonderfully explains the cause and effects of such policies. I would considered it as a mandatory reading material for anyone interested in French history.	2004-02-11

I found Anthony Levi's biography on Cardinal Richelieu to be quite readable and informative. The author definitely appears to know his subject well and the complex personality of Richelieu comes out with clarity and understanding. When you write a biography of man like Richelieu, background materials must be included to revealed the extraordinary period that he lived which made Richelieu, such an extraordinary historical personage. While deeply hated by his own people during his lifetime, it would be no discredit if he would be regarded as a national hero today since without Richelieu, there may not be a France as we know it.	2004-02-11

But the book also understand that Elizabeth didn't go into Ireland by chocie but by necessity. A weak nation so close to England where it could be used by her many enemies, Elizabeth couldn't let the Irish alone. Irish lords didn't help the matter by catering to Elizabeth's enemies. The near genocidial wars that took place during Elizabeth's reign was direct result of all that. Religion, English effort to colonialized and taxes didn't help. I thought the book covered the entire story of these Irish wars very nicely without boggling down the reader with excess information. But like the previous reviewer, I wish the author went bit more into the O'Neill rebellion which was quite important.	2004-02-11

It was one of the biggest mass murders in the history of the American west and ironically speaking, the killers were white men, murdering white people in cold blood. With considerable courage, the author painted a very clear picture of what this massacre was all about and within her limited means, gave a cause and effect of the incident. I used that term &quot;limited means&quot; because the author was (now deceased) a member of LDS and she probably compromised some of more inflamatory elements of the massacre so other writers like Will Bagley and Sally Denton can go at it. Her defense of John D. Lee was bit surprising to me but I figured that she knew that Lee was nothing more then a scrapgoat for the Mormon Church. But she did not take any inroads to the actual responsibility of the massacre. Like I wrote in the earlier reviews on books written by Bagley and Denton, I would considered this book to be a valuable first book of three that honestly deal with the Mountain Meadow Massacre.	2004-02-09

Still, the book covers all aspects of samurai warfare althought I thought it would be nice if he gave us a more indepth looks at some of the great samurai leaders like Ashikaga Takauji, Mori Motonari or even Oda Nobunaga. The book does a very creditable job overall in providing basic historical material on the samurai warfare. On this fact alone, its well worth the money.	2004-02-09

But I would be honest to say that this book is NOT for casual readers since the subject matter is so alien and complex to many English speaking readers. Meiji Restoration is a complex subject matter even for Japanese history students but Jansen should be credited for bringing such a matter to clearer light in his book.	2004-02-09

The author proves to be very skilled in explaining each element of the old samurai form of govenment that basically ran Japan for 250 years and at least I came out with a far greater understanding of how and why each element of such government existed.

Since the author don't make any bones that this is just an introductory work, I am judging on his intent, which was just write a simple biography which will be readable and understandable to the English speaking population.

In 215 pages, the author, John Curtis Perry managed to captured the basic essence of the American Occupation of Japan after World War II. From the way he writes, it appears to be one of America's finest hours, both as a nation and as a people. Rarely has the two foes who fought such a bitter war against each other, kiss and made up so quickly. As a people, Americans proves to be very magnanimous victors and interestingly enough, the Japanese were very agreeable losers. The book also revealed Douglas MacArthur at his best and considering all the things that should have gone wrong, it was pretty amazing that it went so right. Short, interesting and well written, a very good introductory book on the subject matter.	2004-02-08

His book represent the worst of the American adversial justice system but still, I found some part of what he has to say interesting. He's really trying to create a &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; case as the American court system demands but in doing so, forget that he's writing a history book. He forgets that history don't need a &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; to make its own definitation. There are several very simple and logical reasoning why most historians thinks that Richard III murdered his nephews. They are rather cut and dry and have been repeated over and over. That they disappeared as he took power, never seen again while Richard was in power. Sure Henry VII could have done it  and host of millions if you like but no one had the opportunity, the motive and the means to do it like Richard III. And like all previous fallen princes, they were deposed of as their living presence create a threat to the new ruler on the throne. That was the way it was back then and probably in many parts of the world today, still work that way. The author, by forgetting the basic of human nature, specially nature of mediveal rulers, goes off in all kind of unusual tangents to proves Richard's innocence. It might work if Richard was alive today but its still falls very short in the history.<br />In some ways, you can probably referred to this book as Richard III's defense manual.	2004-02-08

Personally speaking, I thought this was a well written and well researched biography that must be on mandatory reading list for anyone intersting in the life and time of King Richard III. However, it should be noted that the author proves to be very sympathic in nature toward Richard and although he does his best to clear all the Shakespearean myths about Richard, it could be said that he probably went too far in some cases in creating a Richard that may be too good. In one case, the case of the missing and presumably murdered Princes in the Tower, Kendall does go all out to proves Richard's innoence. I can lived with that but Kendall failed to realized why so many believed that Richard had a hand in it. Why? Well....the Princes disappeared as he took power and never seen again after he did. Sure, Henry Tudor could have done it and host of many, but like Edward II, Richard II and Henry VI, these princes were rightly considered as the direct threat to reigning ruler's throne which was bit shaky to begin with. Their termination would be logical, necessary and poltically acute - even in our time period. I think Kendall was one of the movers of the Richard the Innocent Man concept regarding the Princes' murders. Many books have been written to back him up or to condemn him. Just for that, the book needs to be read and enjoyed. Kendall proves to be an excellent writer, good historian and got a sense of justice even if you don't agreed.	2004-02-08

I considered this book to be an interesting and quite a complex book which integrated all facets of Civil War elements to explained why the South lost the Civil War. To fully appreciate this book, you have to be pretty well knowledgable about Civil War and understand it without regional bias. This is a military history book and probably not geared toward the casual reader. I have read the previous reviews and they tell me that these folks probably didn't understand what the authors were trying to do. A good example would be how one of them would complaint about how the authors would compared things with the Napoleonic armies and tactics. Well, to anyone who knows anything about the American Civil War, most of the miltiary commanders who were West Pointers were heavily influenced by the Napoleonic Wars and concepts. The southern commanders especially were heavily influenced by this. Its only logical that some cause and effect reasonings must be shown between the Confederate military effort and Napoleonic influence. Others complaint about lack of nationalism in the Confederacy that book explain. Yes, nationalism was very high at the beginning of the war but it wane considerably by the end. Like the Third Reich, Confederacy fought on beyond a reasonable limit and led to a devastating effects to the region as result. Lack of nationalism definitely made it easier for the North to overcome the south in the end as southern armies were bleeding men who were just walking away from their unit (see that movie Cold Harbor for small example). The hard core Confederate soldiers was heavily outnumbered by the southern population who just wanted the war to end. Was the authors bias against the south? I don't think so. I think the authors were pretty straight forward on the facts why the south lost the war. In defeat, the picture is never very pretty.<br />Overall, I found the book to be interesting. I supposed it could have been written so it might be easier for the casual readers but since it wasn't intended for such readers, it leaves folks like me to enjoyed what the authors had to say and to understand their perception even if I may agreed or disagreed at my option.but since it wasn't intended for such readers, it leaves folks like me to enjoyed what the authors had to say and to understand their perception even if I may agreed or disagreed at my option.	2004-02-07

Davis have provided us Civil War readers with another pure winner. Of all the biographies I have read on Jefferson Davis, this book definitely proves to be the best. It highly readable, interesting as well as entertaining and after you finished with the last page, you actually feel like you know something about Jefferson Davis, his talents which was outweighted by his weaknesses. The biography paint a rather tragic figure of man who was so devoted to his cause but yet, did so much to defeat it. The irony will proves to be unforgettable to anyone who read the book. I would considered this book to be one of these so called &quot;must read&quot; book by anyone who have a slightest interest in the Civil War.	2004-02-07
US	52363384	R2V5JJUKZ2K7WQ	0374253854	630469625	Samurai William: The Englishman Who Opened Japan	Books	2	13	18	N	N	Good writing, questionable history	Like most reviewers before me, I was quite enthralled with the story of William Adams, the foremost Englishman in early Tokugawa Japan period. I supposed the recent released of Shogun on DVD have inspired me to read this book since the main character of that show was based on the titled character. The book was well written but like one reviewer before me stated, it relied totally on European sources which have a tendencies to be very inaccurate or even bias. How can one write anything on Japan at all without Japanese sources. A good example of this was when the author described Shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu as &quot;sadistic&quot; for the way he dealt with the Christians. Considering that he was considered as quite an enlightened ruler by many historians, the author totally failed to point out that Iemitsu's actions against the Christians took on a devastating scale only after the Japanese Christians and their padres mounted a full scale revolt at Shimabara Castle in 1637. While considered as a &quot;peasant revolt&quot;, primary fighting forces were Christians. This revolt shocked the Tokugawa bakufu to the core which led to drastic reaction. Such oversight like this cheapen the accuracy of the well written words. (What ruler in Europe would not have done the same if a large group of Buddhists joined a large scale revolt against crown and realm??)<br />While the book was supposed to be on William Adams, it basically centered around the English effort to promote trade with Japan. Ironically, it might be hard to regard this as Adams' biography at all. He seem to be a background character a lot of time. What really hurt this book was that the author appears to be totally unfamiliar with Japanese history and totally lacks Japanese sources. Would a book on English history be any worth if there was no English sources?? Two stars for good writing and entertaining reading material though, can't fault the man's skill with the English language!<br />PS: In that revolt mentioned above, Dutch provided a warship that help pummeled that revolt to the ground. It was probably one of the major reasons why the Dutch kept their trade base opened while all other European powers did not.ove, Dutch provided a warship that help pummeled that revolt to the ground.

After reading Samurai William, I wasn't too impressed with Giles Milton but I was totally delighted with this book. Big Chief Elizabeth proves to be very well written and interesting book about the early effort of English coloniziation of the North America and their disappointing fate until Jamestown. There are a lot of histoy here but its all very readable and easy to digest. The author obviously in this case, knows his material and his interesting explanation on the infamous lost colony of Roanke proves to be quite interesting. One of the better books written on this subject, almost anyone would enjoyed this book as entertaining as the characters and stories goes.	2004-01-21

However, the book proves to be an excellent reference material as well. Its pretty clear that David Rattray knows his material and how to present them. Combination of great photos (b/w and color), excellent illstrations, maps and well written narrative, this book actually covered all aspects of the Zulu War. There are tons of information packed in this short book. This book appears to be a history book in disguised as a tour guide book.

Its honest because its brutally politically incorrect. The American soldiers who relates their stories, tell not only of the horrors that the Japanese troops committed but additional horrors of what they did to the Japanese troops. This was no-hold bar combat, where there were no &quot;good guys&quot; or &quot;bad guys&quot; per say. The stories related in this book was all about killing, surviving and living on. In doing so, anything goes and there were no rules. It may be that many general readers may be kind of shock to read so honest account. Some of them may not like the read how the Americans in these pages acted with certain amount of brutality that almost mirror their enemies. But then, what is war after all, right?	2004-01-12

Glines	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Superbly written and presented autobiography...	This book definitely stands out as one of the superior autobiographies to come out of a major World War II figures. Its come a bit late but I found it to be quite rewarding reading material. Perhaps he was right, he would never be this lucky again since his life story appears to be filled with eternal good fortune, blessed by a first class mind and abilities. I was surprised to learned how much time he spent in Alaska (my home state) and many other details of his life which most readers will not know about. The book proves to be quite addictive and I frankly, read it in a single sitting. The man have done and experience so much stuff that it must have seem to be like a dream to him, looking back. I considered the book a must read material for anyone interested in a major World War II figure or anyone with any interest in aviation history.	2004-01-12

I think this book was geared too much toward the general readers. Much of the information seem rather generic in nature and book as a whole, don't say too much. For beginner level Roman military history, its a pretty passable book but for experience reader like myself - and perhaps like some of the previous reviewers, I found the some of the information pretty questionable, unproven or simplistic. There seem to be little source to the facts given and as previously reviewers noted, there were two 10th Legions and there seem to be no fact linking Caesar's 10th to the 10th that took Masada!!

This book proves to be very nicely written, well researched and clearly unbias in nature. The writing prose flows very nicely and I was pretty much engrossed by the subject, material and information the book provided. Since it covered a subject matter not well known in the United States, we can considered it as a blessing that there is such a book like this to enlightened us.

I believed that Gavin Daw did an excellent job in this book and it probably a must read account for everyone.<br />To most Allied POWs, their treatment at the hands of the Japanese must be shocking, unthinkable and utterly humilating. It was also quite deadly as well. The book revealed all this very nicely and with shocking details. Its not for the weak of heart here. These men were taken prisoners by an troops who don't believed in surrendering as long as their nation was at war, thus these Allied POWs were often looked upon as cowards, unsoldier-like or subhuman insects by their captors. And they were treated as such. Looking back on Japanese own military history, their many civil wars they fought against each other, I would considered it as a near mircle that they took prisoners at all!!!! I think what really hurt the POWs was that the Pacific War was a racist war, where both sides have basically reduced each other to a subhuman level and thus, the Allied POWs were treated as such. Such as Henry Wirz, infamous commandant of Andersonville, no longer look at his Union prisoners as human beings, Japanese captors did the same and result was a horrifying sense of holocaust of the Allied POWs during the Pacific War.<br />A great book overall, a book that will preserved the horror of war for the men who experienced it and for folks like me to learned from it. Man inhumanity to man, whether bayoneting a helpless, straving POW or firebombing a grade school from high above, there are no rules in war!!!!	2004-01-12

Desmond Seward's book does much to clear the myth about Henry V from the theater and movie images but as the title of the book suggested, Henry V was a warlord and a pretty good as that. I enjoyed reading this book, clearly written, neatly on focus as Seward does not spread himself too thin and kept his eye on the military aspect of Henry V's career. That was his purpose for the book, wasn't it? The book revealed that Henry was a gifted commander, brutal as any but no more then any for the time period. he waged an aggressive war and took advantages of his enemies. That don't make him a bad man in my book, not during that period of history. Henry V's only sin, it seem was that he simply died too soon and left a son too young. Overall, a very good book, author's effort to show the \\"real\\" Henry V was a success but Henry's accomplishments were real enough that Shakespeare wanted to make him a national hero!	2004-01-12

Fought during the Second Punic War, Hannibal who won this great tactical victory will be forever be remembered by it. This battle set the standard of what we would regard as a total tactical victory on the battlefield. Gregory Daly's book goes into considerable details on how this event took places, forces and commanders involved and lay-out of the battle, location, formations and conditions. Daly's put considerable effort into his research and what we have here is a very definitive book on the battle of Cannae. Its also helped that I thought Gregory Daly wrote pretty well, nicely paced and clearly written. Anyone with a slightest interest in this time period should buy this book.	2004-01-12

The book proves to be superbly well written and very easy to read. Its a history book on general regular war in Spain, looking closely at battles and individual campaigns which made up this war. As one of the earlier reviewers wrote that it really doesn't go into that much details about politics, people or guerillas. I supposed for an one volume book, there probably isn't enough pages to due justice if Gates spread out too thinly. With this in mind, this book with its extremely readable writing, should be part of every Napoleonic library.	2004-01-10

Mr. Turnbull did great justice with probably limited reference material (mostly in Japanese no doubt) in trying to revealed what this 12 years of campaigning between two great Japanese warlords - Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin - over the same territory was all about. I believed Mr. Turnbull did accomplished his goals within the frame work of the short Osprey format. I thought the book was pretty well broken down into easy to read sections, each of them going through each of the five campaigns that took place in and near Kawanakajima area. It was ironic that all the efforts and time both leaders put into their Kawanakajima campaigns probably ultimately weaken their respective clans in the face of up and coming warlords like Oda Nobunaga. While Takeda Shingen did appears to win the overall 12 year struggle, it was all for nothing since his clan didn't survived his own death for long. I thought the book was pretty well written by Mr. Turnbull and anyone who is interested in this time period of Japanese military history should enjoyed this addition to the Osprey Campaign series. Overall, a pretty good book of a little known set of campaigns - little known in this country that is.	2004-01-10

Unlike one of the earlier reviewers, I don't think this book is superior to David Chandler's Campaigns of Napoleon which is still the standard work but this book might proves to be a great supplement. John Elting's writing flow very nicely and he says a lot in a limited space. His opinions are always reflective of the true measure of the situation and he make difficult scenes easy. This book must be a standard issue in anyone's Napoleonic library.	2004-01-10

However, the writing proves to be so sympathetic that its almost useless as reference material or even an understanding look at the man's life. The author, Susan McCloud obviously cares much about Brigham Young to a point of almost hero worship. She seem unable to write about the man since she seem to be totally enamor with her subject. Not once did I believed that Brigham Young as so loving, so perfect and so holy as the author painted him to be. McCloud's Brigham Young don't even seem to be human at times. What good is it to point out his greatness without revealing his weakness? Without such contrast, how can you write about such an important man - not only in Mormon history but in the history of the American west???<br />For once, I would like to read a biography on Brigham Young without someone praising him to heaven or damning him to hell!!	2004-01-08

I was bit shocked at the level of bias that the author had against Napoleon. Actually I shouldn't be since I read couple of his earlier books and they were definitely anti-Napoleon in nature. To called this book a \\"hatchet job\\" on Napoleon cannot be too far from the truth. The author really seem to distaste Napoleon and I am afraid that make him totally unfit to write his biography. If you hate Napoleon, then this book is for you. If you want a more fair and objective biography, please look else where.	2003-12-30

I thought the author did an very good job in analyzing and thinking through the military, economic and political situation prior to the Pacific War. The book also goes into what the allies were thinking as well and their strategies in responding to the Japanese moves. The book covered the period up to April 1942. By then, allies strategic plans have gone down the wastebasket with Singapore and Bataan falling to the outnumbered Japanese. When I initially read this book, it was one of the first time I realized that the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor may not have been a big as success as we Americans often thought it was. I realized now that Admiral Yamamoto's objective at Pearl Harbor should have been the naval base at Pearl Harbor instead of the ships. In many ways, the battleships were unimportant element in the overall scheme of thing. The base, was far more important then any group of ships! Interesting insight such as this can be found throughout this book which make it somewhat a necessary for any one interested in the Pacific War to read.	2003-12-30

It was not as complete or good as As Christ and His Saints Slept and this is probably because the first book centered around Matilda while the second book really don't have a real center. I thought Time and Chance was perhaps too short of a book and more pages could have been given to dig deeper with Thomas Becket or any other characters who looked like they needed more fleshing out. I thought Eleanor have gotten a short end of the stick which is kind of funny since Penman wrote her pretty well in her shorter mystery novels. I hope this will be just the weak link of the trilogy since I am looking forward to the third book, perhap realizing that it cannot be as bad as the second.	2003-12-30

This book seem to be written in the exact same prose, style and concept as most of David Eddings' works that came before it. I was almost expecting Belgarath or Sparhawk to pop out somewhere but too bad they didn't show up. The plot, the story or the characters were not very original. It seem that David Eddings have lost his creative genius and seem to be recycling his earlier works all over again. Instead of taking several books, he does it all in one this time around. If he was in such a rut, maybe he should write another Belgarath novel or something since he seem unable start sometime totally new.	2003-12-30

Outside of a very misleading title, this book proves to be an indepth study on the conception, consideration and ultimate rejection of Morgenthau Plan. The plan was considered very controversial because it called for Germany to be stripped of all industries and reduced to an agricultural state. In hindsight of course, the plan can be considered to vastly short sighted and un-American in nature, almost guranteeing a very vengeful Germany somewhere in the future. But during the latter part of the World War II, Morgenthau Plan had its supporters and it was considered as a serious plan. This book proves to be one of the few books that actually looked behind the Morgenthau Plan. It also take a good look at Franklin Roosevelt's declining ablity to lead our nation in the time of war and how he ignored the destruction of the Jews in Europe. I think I read this in one of the earlier reveiws but I also wish that there was a section on how our nation went from something like a Morgenthau Plan to the Marshall Plan. Story of that transformation would have been a good addition to the book.	2003-12-26

It may not be the best biography on Elizabeth, that honor probably belonged to Alison Weir's work but written like a novel, this book will take you places where history books rarely does. Here, you learned quite a bit about Elizabeth and her world. You will also learned quite a bit about Elizabeth the person as well. In our modern era, Weir's work and this Mary Lukes' work have withstood the test of time. The difference between the two was the Mary Luke's work may not be as historically accurate as it can be since she explored all aspects of Elizabeth's life, including some of the more legendary incidents. If anyone who watched Elizabeth R on Masterpiece Theater now available on DVD or VHS and wants to get into her life a bit, Mary Luke's book would be a fantastic jumping off place. And believed it or not, you will feel right at home reading this book than a more &quot;scholarly&quot; work. Mary Luke also wrote two more books that dealt with early lives of Elizabeth that may be worth reading as well.	2003-12-10

Unfortuately, its also a tale of saddness and disappointment as the toll of war made it mark on the survivors while it took the lives of others. I think one of the great tragedies of this book probably lies with the author's father, who strunk back when he should have spoken out during the long life that was blessed him. Men like him should be speaking since so many who were at Iwo Jima could not. But the book proves be reflective on the cost and toll of our soldiers in war, any war.	2003-12-06

Rather an amazing book on one of the darker sides of American society in the south, it almost unbelievable that until just a short generation ago, such a way of life was generally accepted by the white people of the south. Concept of Jim Crow justice seem so un-American that its small wonder why black people today don't wholly trust the white people. The book deals around the Parchman Farm and the Mississippi prison system but I supposed something like this took place all over the southern states during the Jim Crow era. Its a shock to the system but probably a must read material for any one who is interested in the social history of the southern people.	2003-12-04

I can say nothing but huge amount of praises for Allison Weir's War of the Roses. Its superbly readable, entertainingly fun and quite educational. But why would an author of her scholarship end the account of the War of the Roses at Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471? This is supposed to be a book on the War of the Roses, right? Its like writing a book on World War II and ending it at Stalingrad and Fall of Tunis in first half of 1943!! I read Weir's Princes in the Tower and that book is more like an investigation of their death and the blame. War of the Roses stuff were basically background material. So it can't be considered as &quot;second volume&quot; of this book. Since anyone who knows anything about War of Roses knows that the war &quot;officially&quot; ended with Battle of Bosworth in 1485 which saw the fall of Richard Plantagent to Henry Tudor which resulted in the total change of the royal line (even if they are all related in one ways or another), this book should have gone on that point. Weir probably thought that after Tewkesbury, there wasn't much going on military wise for 14 years until Bosworth but politics can be considered as a form of warfare back then and there were a lot of that going on to make War of the Roses one of the more interesting military conflicts in history. But until she stopped, Weir does a very good job and maybe, she can write a real &quot;second volume&quot; of this book.	2003-12-04

A very interesting and well researched book about Emperor Hirohito and his era. I think this book does clear up more forcefully that Hirohito was involved a lot more with his nation's policies then we have known before. But I think the author got little bias in trying to condemned Hirohito for doing this but I asked, what is wrong with that? He was their Emperor, he should as their Emperor support his own nation's policies if such policies would help his nation. What head of state would not do such a thing? Second, it seem that Bix misunderstood under what conditions Hirohito got his information that his decisions was based on. From all accounts, he was never given the whole picture, never the details and probably in some way, never the whole truth. He was lied to often, deceptive form of misinformation led him on throughout the war until common logic prevailed him to realized that Japan's glorious victory only lies in the minds of his protectors. I think Mr. Bix tell us a lot about how Japan worked prior to end of World War II but not too much about the man himself. Perhaps the title is little misleading after all.	2003-12-04

From my perception, he seem to be saying that Hirohito is gulity of war crimes but not responsible for them. I think I get the feeling that Behr himself may not be sure. One of the earlier reviews which compared Hirohito with &quot;Mr. Carlson from WKRP&quot; seem to be a very good analogy. I don't think Hirohito was that clueless but his influence wasn't all that great. I would recommended that new Pulitzer prize winning biography that came out several years ago. It has a more balance view on the man.	2003-12-03

The book clearly and basically tell, without bogging down the readers, the politics, reasons and why of this campaign and the battle. The maps provided in this book proves to be highly useful, epecially the one that showed how Japan was divided between Ishida and Tokugawa sides. I think the only issue where the author failed was in part, he didn't explained how the Toyotomi family felt at this period since they were at the moment, the ruling family of Japan. (They thought this was a war between their two major retainers - only to realized later on that only one of the retainers were really loyal to them - the loser!) In a campaign and battle where loyalty, betrayal and backstabbing seem to be the order of day, the author does an admirable job in putting it all together under 100 pages. Considering that there isn't too many books written in English about this battle in the first place, it probably a must read for anyone who have any interest of the Sen-joku Jidai.	2003-12-03

William Piston's work came first so he get the credit for turning the tide for James Longstreet who have long been a goat and villain of the Lost Cause of Confederacy. Piston proves to be a good writer, fair and honest about Longstreet. The controversy that surround this general are treated with a sympathic outlook, realizing that perhaps, Longstreet was too honest and blunt for his own good during the time and period he was alive. Longstreet made many errors during the war and he did many great things as well. His major mistake was telling the south after the war that Lee did the same thing. I think if the reader read both Piston and Wert's biographies, he got Longstreet pretty well covered.	2003-12-02

Obviously, there seem to be several different accounts of this incident but I found Buckner Melton's version to be pretty close to the mark. Other reviews before me have written much about it but I would add little bit of review, the book could have used some illustrations, of the ship, the primary players of this incident and maybe even a blue print of the Somers. Considering level of teen violence today, Melton's accessment sound pretty reasonable to me.	2003-11-30

After reading many of the reviews, I was bit dismay to figured out that many of these people wanted the authors of this book to basically mimic Frank Herbert. Well, much to dismay of these readers, Frank Herbert been long dead and he should not be mimic by his son. After reading this book, I began to enjoyed the story, the fast pace style and exciting set of characters. I wasn't concern if the trivial storyline don't jive with the original storyline written by Frank Herbert as long as the basic spirit was there and presented in a fine form. When I read this book, I didn't expect to see the ghost of Frank Herbert and the exactness of his universe. Being a Trekkie of a sort, I am quite used to how things don't jive with the original TV show. I haven't read the second or third books on this series but I thought that the first book was good reading and fun. I think expanding and adjusting Herbert's universe is a good thing. As science fiction reader, I can appriecate that we will not be gridlock into a vague format.	2003-11-29

To a serious student, its a well known fact that the quality of the German army was much higher then our's. We had quantity in terms of material while they had quality in terms of men. Much of this had a lot to do with difference of training, troop assignments and relationship between each other. The author explained this in a clearest way, why the Germans were able to maintained that quality in the mist of defeats while Americans were not able to catch up even while we were winning. I think what will amazed any reader is how well the German military actually took care of their troops - in terms of support and morale. Fighting against the Hollywood image mode, the author make it clear that the German army was actually bit more caring then the American army in the way they treated their soldiers. How the Germans maintained their esprit de corps will be an eye-opening reading experience, even for American WWII veteran who may wished that they were also treated as such. Author compared the two armies putting out the pros and cons of their methods. But book clearly show that the best army always don't win the war and quality of troops, never how high, cannot win victories if everything were stack against them. There is a lesson to be learned here even today as our highly trained and high tech army cannot secured a defeated nation. This book belonged in every World War II reader's library and it should be reread every couple of years. Don't let the price scare you.	2003-11-29

Luckily, I didn't buy this book at Amazon and thankful that I did not. For 96 pages of information (rest is index), this book is grossly overpriced. The material isn't too bad and its quite informative if your knowledge of Imperial Roman administraton is limited. The book discussed how client kings works, how cities were managed and all that. But the writing is bit dry, it felt more like a college thesis then a professional work since due to short length, it summarized a lot.

Jimmy Doohan who became famous by playing &quot;Scotty&quot; on Star Trek TV and movies wrote what must be a relatively dry book on his life. While information was somewhat interesting and his background material a food for trivia loving Trekkie, Doohan apparently forgot why he was so famous...famous enough that people will buy a book about his life. Whether Doohan like it or not, Star Trek made him and without it, he would have probably been just another character actor, competence but forgettable. His views on Star Trek would have been very valuable and interesting to all fans who followed the show and in turn, followed him. So it was pretty disappointing that he didn't covered Star Trek that much and didn't get deep into it. William Shatner, whom Doohan admit that he didn't like, wrote a more honest set of memiors although I am sure from the perceptions of others, that may be debatable. I hope Mr. Doohan rethink about his legacy which for better or for worst, lies with Star Trek and write a book - a second volume if must be, on his experience on that show and movies.	2003-11-29

War Without Mercy is a very original book because its one of the first time that the Pacific War was reduced to a common level of hate. The author make it clear that hate was the primary factor here, pure and simple hate that reduced their enemy into a sub-human level. Some Americans might be offended by that and go into denial that their fathers might behaved in such matter but in war, everything goes and everything is justified. Many of our veterans might take offense that they shot up defenseless Japanese sailors in water or took their ears for jollies (things that only our enemies would do by our propaganda) but the bias memories of today will not erase the butual elements of the war itself. Was the Pacific War a racist war? Of course it was, how can anyone think otherwise? Was American soldiers racist in nature against the Japanese? Of course, America of 1930s and 40s was a racist society in the first place. If you think otherwise, asked any black person who experienced the American dream during that period. This book is a must read for every World War II reader who wants a greater understanding. It will make any reader realized that even in the war between the &quot;good guys&quot; and the &quot;bad guys&quot;, there is only a thin line of difference and that line get crossed every single second of this war. Both the Japanese and American military fought against each other with extreme hate that can only be rival by combat situation in the Eastern Front between the Russian and the German. That was race war too. It may sadden the readers today how dirty both sides were and how merciless both sides acted. Only thing that really should amazed the readers today would be how thing changed so much when the shooting stopped. See Dower's Embracing Defeat for the next step.	2003-11-28

This latest book by Stephen Sears proves to be highly readable and interesting account of the Battle of Gettysburg. Sears reaccount the battle very clearly and his perception proves to be fair and on target. Its a thick book and gear toward the hard core readers of the American Civil War. Sears does something that very few Gettysburg books ever tried to do, that is to give credit to George Meade. While many books tries to explained how Lee lost the battle and why, the man who won the battle often get the short end of the stick when it come to this battle. Sears can be credited in correcting that and giving Meade good credit for out-generaling Robert E. Lee. Meade in this book, proves equal to the task and it was nice to read for once, how Meade won the battle. In my view, I thought that this approach was way over due and make the book more interesting - especially for those who have read many books on this battle.	2003-11-27

While its not good as his work on Patton, D'Este managed to conveyed a true essence of Eisenhower and his abilties as a soldier. The author is fair and correct and while Ambrose's books may be more detail, Ambrose was definitely Eisenhower's admirer and defender. D'Este appears to admired Eisenhower but he seem to realized that Ike got some super limitation as a soldier, that is - a fighting soldier which Ike definitely is not. Eisenhower we see here proves to be the ultimate paper pusher, supreme organizer and as many thought during the war, a fantastic chairman of the board. He seem to be the World War II version of General George McClellan of the Civil War in some ways (without McClellan's super ego and risk fearing personality). What is interesting is how Eisenhower, a student of military history, failed to understand the political aspect of war which is just as important as the military aspect. I don't think Ike ever considered the post-war situation once during his period as Supreme Allied Commander and that was a major failing in his part. But a great book overall, I wished D'Este finished covering Eisenhower's military career which did not end with the surrender of Germany. (It also interesting to note that General Omar Bradley continued to get bad press by historians of our generation.)	2003-11-26

Its definitely is a military history of those troops instead of social or political history. The author appears to know his stuff and I supposed for many neo-Confederates out there, this book will sound very politically incorrect since it shows the brave soldiers of the south murdering defenseless black POWs after some battles. Of course, I am sure the black troops did some paid back as well which in the face of war, was only proper. This seem to distract many readers but overall, this book is about the black troops of the war and how they fought, performed and conducted themselves. All was not glory for them but in hindsight, they did quite well considering the situation they were in.	2003-11-01

MacArthur's War proves to be an fine indictment on General Douglas MacArthur's conduct during the initial year of the Korean War. While many reviewers out there don't like the negative look on this man, its pretty clear that MacArthur totally misread the entire military and political situation during his tenure. MacArthur's Inchon landing must be one of the great masterpieces of military operation but his actions after Inchon proves to be totally incompetent, out of touch and wishful thinking. MacArthur's fall from grace is nicely told in this book and despite of many reviewers prior to this writing who thought that the book was hack job on MacArthur, nothing can deny the fact that the Chinese caught MacArthur with his pants down, drove back his forces, inflicted losses on us and we suffered a major military defeat in North Korea under MacArthur's leadership. The author was correct in pointing out how little time MacArthur spent in Korea and that &quot;Dug-out Doug&quot; mentality didn't help the situation when things got rough along the Yalu. While Douglas MacArthur was one of our greatest soldiers of the 20th century, toward the end of his active career, his talents and instincts began to failed him. This book showed the flashes of his genius as well as follies of his arrogance.	2003-10-31

Any educated Civil War (or &quot;War for Southern Independence&quot;) reader will have a good time reading this book which borderlined on historical fantasy.

I found Sally Denton's American Massacre to be a fine piece of history writing. She have written well, the cause and effect that initiated one of the greatest atrocities in American history. I'll be frank here, if you are a member of LDS, you will probably find this book to be offensive and defies all you were ever told about this incident. That is too bad but I guess the book was written for rest of the world. Denton make it clear that it was the white Mormons who without mercy, cruelly butchered 120 men, women and children, under the flag of truce on a pretension of a honorable surrender. What make it worst was that even if Bingham Young, prophet and leader of LDS didn't ordered the killing, he took an active hand in protecting the murderers, covering it up, making him just as guilty as those who committed the foul deed. This doesn't make Young much of a prophet which was why LDS today decries any effort to bring up this old atrocity. So much of their faith depends on Young being a prophet of God instead of Satan. Nazi-like style of massacre also don't painted the white Mormon milita very well either which was another reason why this church like this entire incident swept under the carpet. If not, then let the blame go to the Indians and to the victims. These were Mormons' excuses even to 1990s. The author rises a super interesting question here. Why did Young sent a messenger telling his Mormon fellowers not to harm the wagon train. Well, anyone who watches too many Colombo episodes can tell you why....its called covering your rear end. Let us face it, since Utah at that time was run as a theocracy with Young at the top, nobody will ever do anything this big without some form of approval from above. Mormons were too well discipline to take things into their own hands. As Denton revealed, blood atonement for anyone stepping out of bound provided that discipline. The author tell stories of Mormons who were badly beaten or killed for helping out that wagaon train - either out Christain charity or greed. Wiping out an entire wagaon train was too much responsiblity for any one at a local level, some sort of approval must come from Salt Lake City and guess who resides there. Denton turned many of this into a working theory, perhaps in modern time, enough to bring Young to a grand jury. This overall, proves to be an important book but if there was a weakness, its not as detail as you want. Thus, I believed that this book, along with works by Juanita Brooks and Will Bagley, form a trilogy of books which should be an standard reference for Mountain Meadow Masacre for many years to come.either out Christain charity or greed.

But Leonard Arrington avoids the major controversies that surrounded Brigham Young, exhorting on his virtures rather then his faults. While that does not make a bad biography, it doesn't show us the complete man.  Arrington make it clear that Young was the right man for the right job at the right moment in history. Without his leadership, intelligence and gusto, the Mormon church probably won't have survived the death of Joseph Smith, its founder. Arrington revealed how talented, how skilled and how devoted Young was to his church and how he put all he had into it. But what Arrington failed to get into, was some of Young's failings which must be just as important as his accomplishments. Arrington played into the traditional Mormon defense on Mountain Meadow Massacre, doesn't question Young's devotion to plural marriages which often rallied the rest of the nation against the Mormons and Young's racist attitudes - especically toward blacks that the LDS Church didn't resolved until the 1970s. Although these are just examples, they presented long term problems that Young left behind and they should have been address by the author. But overall, its still a good biography and worth the effort in reading it and understanding the basic essence of the man.	2003-07-09

I found the book to be quite an enjoyable read but like most of the other people who wrote reveiws on it, what bring down the book was lousy maps. Considering the details that the author offered in the book in tracing movements, battles and all that, good maps should have been alloted all over the book. Instead there were basically generic maps in the middle of the book. It sad when I have to go to other books like West Point Atlas of Napoleonic Wars to get a clearer pictures of what the author was trying to say. Considering how familiar the author is to the entire area of operation, maybe he fell into a mind trap of thinking that everyone knows the terrains as much as he. Other then that, I don't have much more to add then what was written before.	2003-07-09

This proves to be a pretty interesting conspiracy book which in some way, may related to our current problems with terrorist activites. Here, we have an alleged set of papers found on the body of Colonel Ulric Dahlgren who was leading one of the cavalry columns which was supposed to free the Union POWs in Richmond. The papers found states that Dahlgren and his men planned to mass murder the Confederate government and burn Richmond to the ground. These papers gave a pretext for the South to go ahead with their own plans to conduct terroristic actions against the North. Was the papers planted and forged? Its a story of truth, half-truths and lies. One of the central themes that the book covered was if these Dahlgren papers were real or fake. Duane Schultz (the author) believed them to be fake. I find logic in what he is saying and believed that faked papers were meant to arouse the Southern spirit which have been in doldrum and give pretext for deseperate actions in the north. Well written, nicely researched and well presented, the book proves to be informative and easy to read. Of course, you have keep an open mind as well.	2003-05-16

For people who say that Alison Weir did an axe job on poor Richard, they are right! Was Weir bit bias against Richard? Yes, she appears quite bias and that's showed quite a bit. But she was trying to make a point in this book. The point is that Richard III was responsible - directly or indirectly - of usurping and murdering his lawful King to be (his own nephew) and his brother. For people who may have been sway by reading Paul M. Kendall books or Sunne in the Splendor by Sharon Penman, that may be hard to swallow. There are many folks out there who refused to believed that Richard III can be a murderer of children. But the two princes disappeared from sight forever during Richard's period of power and no one will have the guts to kill royalty without expressed permission from royalty. Weir make that pretty clear in this book. Agreed or disagreed with her evidences and facts, certain aspects of history remains constant.	2003-05-07

She also captured Elizabeth's people that surrounds her, the enemies who envied her and her society that was defined by her. It really hard to go wrong in reading this book. There are tons of Elizabeth I's biographies out there, I read quite few of them myself but I believed this book by Weir would stand the test of time as the best general biography of this great English Queen.	2003-05-07

The author is trying to make a case where he believes that the Japanese samurai's evolution started from 500 AD and continued onward until they took power with Minamoto Yoritomo. Since much of Japan's early military history is unknown to most English speaking people, I found those chapters to be specially enlightening. I found it interesting that Japan's armies between 500-900 AD fought along the continental Asian style with formations - massive armies of peasants rise by local &quot;strongmen&quot; who may have been forerunner of the diamyo class. These armies were led by imperial court's nobles. Only when the court's failure to invest money into this concept did a more specialzed concept of a warrior class slowly came to be. This warrior class which began as specific palace units and local strongmen, will soon supplant the Emperor and his court as the rulers of Japan. Only in the last chapter where it dealt with the Kamakura Shogunate did the author seem to stumble. Apparently either he don't understand or make it clear that Kamakura Shogunate was actually run by the Hojo Regency who did run Japan with an iron fist for many years before the Mongol Invasion which ironically led to the fall of Hojo family (50 years later) who usurped the powers from Yoritomo's family. Author somehow believed that Kamakura's rule wasn't that complete. The fact that he barely mentioned the Hojo family (and how they took totol control of Japan through their puppet Shoguns) or even one of their greatest leaders, Tokimune, who led Japan's defense during the Mongol invasion period tells me that maybe his research in this period wasn't that complete. Otherwise, this proves to be a highly educational and entertaining book to read.	2003-05-04

Alison Weir make an excellent case in stating that Mary, Queen of Scots was not involved in murder of her husband. Her condemnation of the Casket letters appears to be the center point of her case. Since these letters damned Mary, they must be forgeries or else the whole book is meaningless. I am sure that there will be many historians out there who will not agreed with Weir's interpetation and perception but her reasoning appears to be quite fair. Weir does a good job in portarying Mary as an immature, over stressed, under educated and extremely incompetence ruler but not a murderess. Her actions at times were so illogical that it really do defied common sense. Alison Weir does some excellent research and I would considered this to be an excellent supplemental work along with Antonia Fraser's Mary, Queen of Scots book. And its excellent reading material all the way.	2003-04-09

I never understood why so many people called this book a \\"revisionist\\". The book offered new ideas and new ways of looking at things. The center piece of the book lies in George Thomas whom I admired and I thought this book did a fine job in bringing forth his abilities and accomplishments. The author also tore into Robert Lee as well and many called that \\"revisionist\\". Ironically that is not so. Immediately after the end of the war, Lee was critized by many. His status into southern godhood didn't start until after his death when southerners revised their assessment of him and made him into a god-like myth. This was a true period of Lee's historical revisionism. Only in the 1970s and on ward, did the Civil War historians finally began to reverse the trend, bringing Lee down to earth. This book does that very well. I don't exactly agreed with the author's assessment of Grant but I think his admiration for Thomas carried him away although its for a good cause. Grant's military accomplishments during the war was far greater then Thomas'. I do agreed with one previous reviewer who thought that the author should write a biography on Thomas to \\"get it out of his system\\". I think thats an excellent idea. George Thomas needs a good biographier!! (It should be interesting to point out that Thomas, a Virginian, stay true to his sworn oath as a United States army officer while people like Lee broke his sworn word of honor and uses his family as an excuse to do so. Who indeed, had the greater honor??)	2003-02-24

I had profound understanding of George McClellan after reading this book. Stephen Sears, I thought did a fantastic job in bring the truth about this historical character. Some readers may be slightly turned off by this biography since Sears proves to be totally unforgiving toward McClellan. His mistakes, personality and his delusions are presented here starkly, honestly and without mercy. But before anyone think this is a hack job on poor McClellan, think again. Sears presented his facts clearly, logically and with candor. Of course, McClellan wasn't a total dunderhead. He created the famous Army of the Potomac, organized it, reformed it and gave it life which lasted until the end of the war. For that, he deserves the thanks of the Union and a honor place among the heroes of the North. But what curse McClellan was his abilities as a combat leader. McClellan simply didn't know how to used this terrible swift sword, acting as if it was made of glass instead. Sears made it plain that his ineptness as the battle commander doomed McClellan's reputation forever. By far, this book will be considered as a definitive biography on George McClellan for some times to come. When you read it, you will discovered why Robert E. Lee loved him so much as his opposing commander. I would too if I was Lee!!	2003-02-24

When I brought this book, I expect to read about the modern pro and con of actions of Robert E. Lee. Instead, what I got was a superifical biography on Lee and some summary judgement of his actions based on the author's say so. So where is that debate of Lee's critics?? Many people like to dismissed Lee's critics as revisionists but they got it backward. While Lee was alive, he was soundly critized in many circles by veterans of Confederacy and by his foes. It was only after Lee's death did this mythology of Lee's greatness took on a godly scale as the reconstruction period was ending. This period of Lee's mythology is the true period of revisionism which did  not really end until Thomas Connelly came out with the Marble Man which brought Lee back to Earth and where author critized without merit. This book lack any depth and appears to be pretty shallow work. If the author wanted to back up Lee, do with so with evidence and logic. Just saying so don't mean much. This book will probably go back to the used book store soon......	2003-02-23

This book covered a very unglorious period of our nation's history and how our nation grew. The author proves to be quite informative in his study and tried to take everything within the context of the period. Was the Indians in the east coast doomed as Jackson believed? The book make it very plain that they were doom because of people like Jackson. If the whites were honorable and true, most of these Indian nations would have survived easily but since the whites were not, the Indians were doomed as Jackson stated and wanted. Its almost amazing how treaties were made and thrown away like toliet paper. After reading a book like this, it really hard for our nation to stand so tall morally. Yes, all this took place a long time ago but we still whine about Pearl Harbor and the Alamo like yesterday. Our nation commited thousands of Pearl Harbor and Alamo on the American Indians as this book tell us so I think for that, it worth a read.	2003-02-21

I really don't have nothing more positive to add compared to two previous reviews which speak for itself. The book proves to be everything they stated. However, I would like to add this train of thought which may sound bit negative but something for author to considered in the future. For one, it needs a map. Imperial Japan isn't one of these geographical places many Americans really know about. Maps and diagrams would have been greatly helpful. Second, more photos of historical characters in the book. It would be nice to have faces to go with the names - most who were total unknown to most Americans. I am surprised considering the research involved in this book that Mr. Keene could not add more photos even although he writes about them in the book. Otherwise, the previous two reviews proves to be very accurate. Top notch book that combined biographical as well as historical evolution of the Meiji Emperor and his reign.	2003-02-20

The background information involving the troops, Zulus and politics proves to be very informative and well written. Even the aftermath of the battle proves to be quite good as the authors' researched revealed many aspects of interest. However, I wasn't too impressed with the way the author wrote the battle. The maps - while very colorful, wasn't every effective. Description of the battle failed to convey the situation very clearly. I would recommend Zulu Victory by Ron Lock for the best written account of the battle and this book for the best written background material to the battle. If you read both books, you should have an excellent understanding of the entire Isandlwana campaign.	2003-02-20

Well, since there are so many excellent reviews already been written, there is little that I can add outside of this, I believed this book and the one by Juanita Brooks will probably the standard for this subject matter for some times to come. I have long been interested in the event of one of the greatest mass murder ever occured in American West but so little was known about it. But this much is pretty clear by the author, in a modern criminal justice system, Brigham Young would be doing prison time. In 1850s, Utah was ruled by a theocracy - no serious student of LDS history could ever considered that event such as this could be authorized or even be considered without the head of that theocracy knowing about it. I would considered it quite ironic that 19th century version of the 9-11 was perpetuated by another religious minded people, lashing out in blind hatred,	2003-01-24

Battle of Isandlwana was one of the greatest victories that native Africans ever achieved against an European power. This book proves to be one of the best books on this battle. The book covers all your usual stuff like political conditons, military conditions leading up to the war and so forth. But key element of the book was how its dealt with the battle itself. As far as I know, it got one of the clearest blow by blow account of the battle if that could be possible. Many myths about what happened at Isandlwana seem to be more clearer now and respect for Zulu military organization grows as you read on. Its amazing how long it took the British to finally realized that they were coming uder a full scale attack. The book also discussed the covered up by Lord Chemsford after the battle. The covered up was basically to protect Chemsford's military carelessness and the fact that he have been out-generaled by the Zulus. In this, he chose Colonel Durnford since the good colonel was already dead. Interesting how blaming a dead people for mistakes have always been a popular habits of all defeated commanders. The book appears to be well research and the authors' distaste for Chemsford become pretty clear as you read the book. It also got very details maps which help understand the battle. The nice photographs helped - including the infamous British ammo box which showed what a pain it can be to opened one up. Well, with or without ammo, British were doomed in this battle anyway. Probably the best book written on Isandlwana right now.	2003-01-24

Upon reading all these previous reviews, I am still delighted to see that we are still fighting the Civil War in the 21st Century. Instead of muskets, we now uses words. This book is quite a study and I must give the authors high credits for getting the details of the battle down so well. But I think the main element of contested ground of this book lies not in the the authors' study of the battle but the performance of one man in that battle. That one man being Robert E. Lee. The main point of agrument of this lies in how we view this man. Here we are divided into &quot;pro-Lee&quot; or &quot;anti-Lee&quot;. The authors are totally &quot;pro-Lee&quot;, their distactors are &quot;anti-Lee&quot;. Those who praise the book are &quot;pro-Lee&quot; and those who don't like the book are &quot;anti-Lee&quot;. During the post Civil War period, Lee was risen to a near mythological level. This continued until the 1970s when a new thought on Lee which made him a far more human and flawed commander came out. This book does a fine effort to try to turned the tide again to Lee the Perfect General. Its everyone's faults but Lee's, he cannot do no wrong and his generals from Longstreet, Stuart, Ewell and all, failed him. Other reviewers excuses Lee and brought this agrument. If there are any military officers out there, asked yourself this question, who is responsible for the conduct and operation of your troops - you or your subordinates? If your subordinates are making errors, whose responsibility is it to correct them, aid them and help them performed their mission. Lee commanded two untested corps commanders and basically did his usual fire and forget style of command. He did not adjust or adapt the changing situation within his own command structure. Even when he knew or realized that errors were being made, chances wasted, he did nothing to personally correct the situation. In an era of combat where ranking generals can still make a major difference on the battlefield, Lee held a lot of responsiblities in his hands and sat on them. This book basically boiled down the blame game. Who is responsible for the Confederate defeat at Gettysburg? The authors states that its everyone but Lee. Is there a serious military historian out there who think this is bit weird??? (Joseph Hooker didn't lose at Chancellorville, it was XI Corps and Howard!! Napoleon didn't lose at Waterloo, it was Ney! Or should I say, it wasn't Lee who won Chancellorville, it was Jackson! And so on...)eld a lot of responsiblities in his hands and sat on them.

There is a fictional scenairo written by Clunn which he describe the destruction of the three legions and in some parts, reduced it to a personal level.

This book proves to be a great case study for these POWs who suffered in Japan during World War II. While there is no question that they did, the question lies in what does this book mean?<br />In a time of war, unjust and unfair things happens. Its the dirty, dishonorable and unglorious part of any war. These POWs were warriors who took their chances and paid the penalty for their country. They were also unfortunate that the Pacific War was a race war where both sides reduces each other to sub-human levels. Racial hatred is the lowest mean of human emotion and outlook. Are we surprised that they were treated like sub-humans?<br />Our nation also did many things during that war which we were not so proud. We fire bombed cities and people like barbeue. This meant schools, hospitals and civilian homes were cooked up like Sunday picnic (with women and children, of course). But this too, is part of war and it will always be that way.<br />If we fought a honorable war and they did not, then there is just cause. But if both sides fought dirty, using POWs as slaves was one way to the means for the Japanese trying to win that war.<br />Only way the author and her cause can win - will be by changing or rebuking the peace treaty with Japan - who just happened to be our most strongest ally and trading partner in the Pacific. This is a nice way to win trust and maintain friendship. Americans seem to forget that they have a nasty history of breaking or foregoing treaties with non-white people as the American Indians can understand. Are treaty with the Japanese just as expendable??<br />Author also point out with certain racist overtone that American government was justified in rounding up American citizens of Japanese descent because the Japanese army rounded out American citizens in their areas of conquest. Can anyone tell me the slight difference in concept here?<br />Were American POWs abused and mistreated. Yes. So were all POWs captured by the Japanese during that war and for history, Japanese have always done that, even to their people during their civil wars. To be fair to Japanese way of war, they had the lowest amount of POWs taken during the war then any major combatants - so they do practice what they preach - that anyone who surrender during the time of war - is lower then a cockroach in their eyes.<br />It should be mentioned that Japanese probably enslaved whites as one of their major goals of the war - the one they actually achieved even if they lost the war. This goal was to destoryed the concept of white supremacy and colonialism. White folks as slaves does that very nicely to Asian eyes all over the Pacific.<br />The author's cause also may open up a can of worms we may not want to - for if the POWs were able to collect, then that may open up the door for all these blacks whose forefathers were enslaved by whites to get some form of compensation. Fair is fair is it not? Maybe, Japanese and German survivors may sued Boeing and other American companies who built the bombers which was used to firebombed their schools and hospitals for compensation. (I mention this because the author seem to be very fond of quoting the Genvea Convention in her book. I think fire bombing schools and hospitals is also against the Genvea Convention...isn't it?) Where will it end?<br />In war as I understand in history, there is NO RULES. Its not a game, if one is captured by an enemy, he can shoot you, enslaved you or torture you. Its part of being a soldier, isn't it?<br />While I feel bad for these POWs who suffered for our nation, I cannot in good conscience, support their claims - no more then I support the claims of blacks who want compensation for slavery or our former enemies (and we have many) who want compensation for wrongs done in the past by our military and industry.Japanese have always done that, even to their people during their civil wars.
