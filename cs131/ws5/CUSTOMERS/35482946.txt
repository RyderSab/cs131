All he really wanted was to give love and to be loved. This memoir is full of emotions some bad, some good at the beginning I wanted to cry I became angry at the way he was treated as a child. Then to grow-up and to think he had found the love he had been trying to find for so long only to be hurt over and over again. His writing draws you into his life I can only imagine the struggle it must have been to relive some of the events all over again. Nevertheless he is an outstanding writer and storyteller. I recommend this book to all its a look inside of a man's soul, a soul that was Broken but now has been mended!!!	2003-08-27

In some ways Judge Braddock and Derrick McCalister &quot;The Moon&quot; from Surviving Mr. Right almost sounded like the same person(!) Nevertheless both books were outstanding. Keep up the good work you are on the road to success.	2003-06-09

The book is suppose to be about a young girl being molested and her twin sister carrying this secret inside for fear of hurting her mother. (Yeah right) you would think that is what the plot is but noooooo it starts out as the girls being almost 30 years old. The book was poorly written it could not hold my interest. Satin Doll was a much better book. If at all possible please wait and buy this book at a garage sale or check it out in the library.	2002-08-31

I have read all of Omar's books and was very disappointed in For The Love Of Money that is why I waited so long to read this one. I thought the book (Just say no) showed not only a person's love for music but love between two friends. When reading a story you must look at it from all directions. That way you can go where the author is trying to take you. Omar hat's off my brotha you did A fine job the book was kinda lenghty but every word had to be said. The true readers can testify to what I am saying. I cried at the end what a beautiful way to close out the story.	2002-08-25
