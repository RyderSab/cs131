Though I'm new to Howard's work, it's not hard to tell that she is a stand-out writer. The problem comes in when she attempts to make her mystery a passion/romance thriller. And while it's not necessarily something UNFAMILIAR to the mystery/thriller category, I don't see the need for the explicit details throughout. Not only does it take away from the plot, it adds unnecessary clutter to the story. If I'd wanted a cheap romance book, I would have bought one.<br />The plot follows a beautiful female butler/bodygaurd, Sarah,  who suddenly becomes victim to a few 'random' murders in an exclusive area of Georgia. Unfortunately, any true element of suspense is diminshed terribly by the storyline taking on the viewpoints of the other characters. While I can see the author's attempt at versatility with this, it is generally a pretty weak effort and reminds me identically of a James Patterson mystery that was out earlier this year. <br />It's an okay book for a long weekend at home. It just doesn't have any real stand-out qualities.	2002-12-31

A year ago? Two? Since then, her works have weakened with each effort. Princess Diaries I was great, II was above average, III was unfulfilling and now this.<br />Well here it is folks, Cabot's cheesy attempt to portray American families.<br />Is there any cultural diversity in the book? No. Sure, Catherine (the lead character's best friend) is of Hispanic decent, but she's too perfect. The characters have no flaws, no tough side, nothing to make them real. They're thin, transparent. They could never survive the real world.<br />So all right.. Samantha Madison, our leading lady for this story is the tortured middle child striving for individuality (Yet her favorite band is NO DOUBT). She has no shortcoming except her brutal self-esteem level. She saves the life of the president, strives for some more individuality, falls in love with the president's son and they all live happily ever after.<br />Gag me with a spoon.<br />\\"Samantha\\" uses a lot of unnecessary commas. I can excuse profuse swearing, but profuse comma use is just an offense to humankind.<br />The story trivializes what it is to be an American teenager. Where are the gang shootings? Where are the overcome-the-impossible encouragements? Where are the striking words that will allow me to find a true sense of self?? Better yet, where are the author's standpoints on America? If you're doing a book, do it right. I found this book ridiculing and offensive and have lost all respect for Meg Cabot, Jenny Carroll and all other handles she'll go by in the future. I knew musicians could sell out, but authors? It's just inexcusable.<br />I don't mean to offend anyone with this, but it's my opionion and I felt it right to express myself fully on this.	2002-10-21

Being an Atheist, it may seem strange to some people that this book holds any meaning for me, but I think that, despite the religious references, people from all walks of life will relate to the poetic prose of The Prophet.<br />Kahlil Gibran has been greatly celebrated in several countries for the book's simple yet biting phrases. Any two sentences in this legacy of living can be made into a thought-altering quote.<br />Gibran uses a prose style throughout. Short lines of words written as freestyle poetry create a rich medium to deliver his words.<br />Each section has something poweful to say, but some of my favorites were those on Work, Giving, Children, Crime and Punishment, Freinds, Time, and of course Love. <br />As oppposed to most books containing the word \\"Prophet\\" anywhere in the title, Gibran expresses life as something to be enjoyed and soaked in as many ways as possible. The book does not stress the punishment of sins, but to bask in pleasure and not look back. Decadence is not suggested, but the basic purpose of Gibran's legacy is to tell us that life is short and must be lived without regrets.<br />It is a book that includes such beautiful metaphors and velvetty language that you are always sucked into reading \\"just one more section.\\" What makes the book work is not just the simple genius of the author's statements, but also the beauty of his words, the flow of his language.<br />I hate to be like everyone else (in more instances than just this), but it does change you. It states what any prophecy should, and allows the religious aspects of the beliefs to take the backseat to the love of life and aspirations.<br />Buy, read, and live by The Prophet's words.	2002-10-05

Sarah Dessen is by far the best of young adult authors, but I thought that after such a diverse and moving line of novels, this would surely be less effective.<br />What can I say? I'm wrong about a lot of things.<br />The book, which explores the life of Remy, daughter of a best-selling romance novelist, is perhaps Sarah Dessen at her absolute peak.<br />Remy's father was a songwriter who left her mother shortly after discovering she was pregnant with Remy. Perhaps feeling ashamed, he wrote a song called \\"This Lullaby\\" to apologize in his own way. <br />Remy has a ridiculous amount of stepfathers since her father. Her mother, forever the romantic, is planning her fifth marriage to used car salesman Don at the beginning of the book. <br />The character development from there is just sensational. Remy meets Dexter, the up-and-coming local musician who ends up playing at her mother's wedding. Dexter believes in fate and true love, Remy doesn't believe in either. It leaves you asking.. who will be the one to transform and give up?<br />All the characters are created with such depth, you feel as though you know every one of them personally. From the girls' nights out to get Diet Cokes and go to The Spot to the slow but steady realization that Remy's life is about to change forever as she heads off to college. Every detail is so meticulously and beautifully, you can't help being entirely engrossed.<br />It's an enchanting, fresh look on young adulthood, and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a different kind of teen novel.	2002-09-26

Aimee, the best friend of lead character Zoe, commit suicide about a year ago when the book takes place. Zoe was charged with murder because she was sleeping over at Aimee's house that night. We get conflicts of viewpoint throughout, which makes for an incredibly moving storyline, but we also feel Zoe's shame and inability to forgive herself. Though she was proven not guilty at trial, she still feels responsible.<br />You also get a wonderfully emotional look at Zoe's life. The author speaks so genuinely, it's impossible to believe that she hasn't lived Zoe's life. The words flow easily and make the story both darkly wonderful and easier to relate to. Zoe feel entirely unloved by her parents, and feels that her group of friends from \\"there\\" were the only people who ever understood her. All the bad memories are covered by the wonderful memories. <br />It's a book that keeps you guessing. Will Zoe and Chard be able to make it as more than friends? Can her parents, in spite of their possible divorce/separation, become closer to her and show her she's cared for? And, most importantly, can Zoe ever overcome her traumatized adolescence?<br />Buy the book and find out!	2002-09-26
US	47851619	RTLUOZUJ0QTF	0060185147	737127896	Courting Trouble	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Mediocre With the Potential of Being Great	I am new to Lisa Scottline's line of legal thrillers, but suspense as an overall category is certainly nothing I'm a novice to, so I can tell you one thing about this book right off the bat: The author needs help. From the murder that the book circles around on, it was painfully obvious to me who was responsible for the death of Willa. I was a little surprised that the author did throw in the main suspect at all, but I suppose it was to lead you in one direction.<br />I kept reading. <br />And I was very annoyed.<br />Anne is a beautiful girl from California thrown into Philly because she has a stalker. We don't find out about this stalker for a good three chapters (besides the stray elusive comment). It would seem to me that a stalker would always be one of the largest parts of your life. The book should have built up suspense with Anne always making sure her doors were locked, carrying guns, being a hard-core kick-rear babe.<br />....But it didn't. Because Anne is flawed. She feels so un-pretty and her poor little self-concept can't quite understand why people hate her.<br />I think it may be all those Mental Notes. (Come on, I wasn't the only person irritated by those.)<br />The book tries to incorporate too much and loses the potential to be truly scary or grotesque. Anne tries to find love and friends, to save her mutilated family. Because of that, the book loses potential in Anne overcoming her fears and taking a stand for herself.<br />I'll admit it kept me turning pages, but that's due to the beautiful imagery and usage of the English language throughout. And don't get me wrong- Anne has some fun quirks to her personality. It's a nice book to read and it is somewhat uplifting, but it makes a mockery of true suspense/thriller novels. I'm not sure if I would read another of Mrs. Scottline's works, but I think I would read this one again.	2002-09-20

Georgia Nicholson is debating her place in the world yet again. The family vacation to Och Aye Land (otherwise known as Scottland) is one of the highlights of Rennison's hilarious 3rd work, \\"Knocked Out By My Nunga-Nungas.\\" <br />Georgia is a character we have all grown to love through Rennison's \\"Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal Snogging\\" series. We have seen her grow to become the official girlfriend of a \\"sex god\\" named Robbie and enjoyed her ongoing jokes about her parents.<br />Now, some new crises arise.<br />Georgia's cat, Angus, is in love with a Burmese \\"sex kitten\\" owned by Georgia's neighbors. Her father has wanted Angus's \\"trouser snake addendums\\" to be surgically removed for quite a while now, and with Naomi now pregnant, it looks as though Angus's manly days are through.<br />Georgia also thinks she may have some unresolved feelings with her \\"red herring\\" Dave the Laugh (whom she used to entice Robbie the Sex God). She even admits that her relationship with Robbie is strange since he is several years older.<br />It's a book that will make you look like a sputtering fool if read in public and a general good read. I only give four stars because the ending is such a merciless hook (\\"will the kittens be Angus's? Can she balance both a sex god and a laugh at the same time? This is her prime, after all. We'll just have to wait and see.\\") Other than that, it's a great rainy Saturday afternoon read.	2002-06-24

Bridget is a thirty-year-old woman searching for &quot;Mr. Right.&quot; She is infatuated with her boss Daniel, but his attention is not necessarily focused on Bridget. Months of in and out lead into one long, drawn-out account of the boredom of being a &quot;singleton.&quot; The grammar and arrangement is atrocious and unappealing. The book is written like a very long to-do list. It includes nothing in the present tense, and as we all know, inactive verbs make a really boring read! <br />&quot;Bridget&quot; manages not only to be annoyingly British, but also obviously not British at all. The dates on her entry are American dates (mm/dd/yy) and opposed to the proper European way (dd/mm/yy). Her spellings are American but her slang is British.<br />It's just plain confusing and not worth the waste of time it takes to finish. Get &quot;Confessions of a Shop-A-Holic&quot; or &quot;Shop-A-Holic Take Manhattan&quot; by Sophie Kinsella for a more unique, honest and funny portrayal of single British women.	2002-06-10

Susanna Kaysen has done a very good job of criticizing and joking about the very serious problem of personality disorders in her memoir \\"Girl, Interrupted.\\" <br />Kaysen was only in her teens when she tried to commit suicide by taking 50 Aspirin. She states that she didn't really want to die, just to kill off the part of herself that wanted to. This rationalized thinking does improve the overall theme of the book. From her theories on the \\"brain interpretters\\" to her self-discriminatory evaluations of her teen troubles, Kaysen faces the problems uniquely with not only interest, but genuine light-heartedness.<br />The problem comes in that the book is written so lightly, it's hard to tell if Kaysen was honestly a mental patient or is only writing a \\"purposeful fiction.\\" Her poking and prodding at an individual's self-doubt of sanity does prove some points simply without the \\"psycho babble\\" in most mental hospital accounts. <br />Susanna talks about her shortcomings and failings as a teen. From her too-flirtatious personality to the doomed-from-the-start marriage that saved her from further mental hospitalization. She recalls admissions in sexuality with other patients. Her recollections of those who were finally able to recover and those whose conditions declined after leaving McLean Hospital. Her impartial and emotionless recount is good from a non-judgemental standpoint, it even would help people dealing with \\"wrist banging\\" and \\"is that an armoire or tiger in the corner.\\" However, the book is too short, too uninformative. She doesn't inform us how her failed marriage affects her. Why her borderline personality disorder was stopped short, her emotions on leaving the hospital, even her details of her perception of herself today is not as clear as it should be.<br />I applaud Susanna Kaysen for her brave recovery and admission to such a difficult problem. Her ability to make light of a troubled past is very admirable. I just didn't think the book was as satisfying asit could have been.	2002-06-10

She's not quite cut out for the job: Big feet, bad hair, and vegetarian are traits not necassarily princess-y. Despite various efforts by her Grandmere, Mia is still awkward and resistant to her position as princess.<br />I don't know about you, but if I had always been the high school geek and were suddenly the heir to a European principality AND my mother were having my algebra teacher's baby AND my best friend were some irritating psychoanalyzing pug-like person, I'd be a little more interested in change.<br />But my personality is relatively open to change, so perhaps I am reading the wrong books these days.<br />That known, Mia is now dating her nerdy Bio partner Kenny, whom she loathes but holds onto because she's failing most of her subjects and because of social pressures.<br />Well, Mia's always loved her best friend Lilly's brother, Michael. Now okay.. the title is Princess In Love and we know she's sending him anonymous love notes. Plus most of us have also seen the movie already as well. Can't you guess how it's going to end?<br />I'm sorry, but I just didn't think it was funny. I didn't think it was an interesting concept since it's identical to Louise Rennison's or Meagan McCafferty's works. As much as I would like to come here and rave about Princess In Love, I must say that I just don't like the series anymore.<br />Of course, I didn't like \\"Jenny Carroll's\\" (that's Meg Cabot, too) books at all, and she seems to have tapped into the personalities of the characters from her 1-800-Where-R-U series. ...	2002-06-01

Now I know you've heard me before when I said I would never purchase a book featured in Oprah's bookclub. I also know when I am being silly for no particular reason, thanks to Christina Schwarz.<br />Drowning Ruth is one of the few books I've read set in this particular time frame (late 1800s-mid 1900s) that I can actually say I've enjoyed. It's an astounding work of melancholy, suspense and drama. It strikes a chord with anyone who cares about their family and who tries to keep the peace.<br />Amanda was the eldest child and her parents always favored the younger daughter, Mathilda. Amanda's rough mannerisms held her back for years and a hate and jealousy was shrouded beneath the formal fascade of love for her family. <br />Amanda doesn't find love until long after Mathilda, but has full faith in her lover, Clement. But it isn't until too late she realizing a shocking secret and worse-- literally carries his burden for the rest of her life.<br />It's romanticly detailed and you will find yourself immersed in the lush scenery details, each character's well-plotted and thoroughly fitting mannerism. Every asset of this novel builds suspense and sadness, showing the shallow and empty life that both Mandy and Ruth are forced to live without guidance from the light-hearted Mathilda. <br />Intrigue. <br />Repentence. <br />Starting over as best you can. <br />It's an outstanding book in a world where literature mostly seems to be mediocre.<br />I will be ticking days off my calendar for Christina's next novel.	2002-05-31

It's one of those too-innocent and unrealistic types, but that's probably why I like it. <br />The book is about Landon, a high school senior who ends up in drama class because he doesn't want to take the &quot;difficult&quot; classes like chem, physics or advanced math. To say is taken aback by Jamie's beauty from the beginning is a lie, Jamie is regarded as weird because she does good deeds and reads the Bible during lunch.<br />Jamie and Landon end up with starring roles in the senior play, Landon wants to be nice to Jamie because he owes her a favor, but is worried about preserving his reputation. Being seen with nice people is too unpopular.<br />One begins to wonder about Jamie when she starts talking about her goals in life. She says all she wants is to get married. At the time, it seems like a silly goal, but she's with holding a secret that changes everything. It's easy reading, but does the job nicelt.

Well, being the long-time Mary Higgins Clark fan that I am I really thought I'd like this book. But truth be told, this holiday &quot;thriller&quot; is a thunker. It delivers no pinache or pizazz and is written on a 3rd grade level. As a Christian, I am also unhappy with the plot. It's the most unoriginal and tired storyline I've ever read, due to the poor writing it almost is as though they're making fun of Christianity! The lead character was a self-absorbed jerk who lived only for himself and was afraid of commitment &quot;here on earth,&quot; so the saints send him back to prove he's got a good heart. You read the first chapter and you know exactly how the darn thing will end.<br />It is not chilling with mystery. The only criminal aspect is that the little girl this kindred spirit is to save has a father in the Mafia. They try to make it a heart-warming tale as well (which puts the hope of any book being a good mystery right in the stew pot with the burner on high). <br />Mary does well on her own, but Carol's books are notoriously bland. The recipe for a good mystery book simply does not have &quot;co-write with your daughter&quot; in the ingredients. Pick up It or On the Street Where You Live for a suspense novel you'll never forget.	2002-05-02

It was an inspiring and realistic look at teen life, and followed some very different teenagers all with very different goals. So, when I bought America, I was hoping for something equally as stellar.<br />From the first page to the last, America is hard to follow. It's filled with flashbacks and flash forwards, is uninspirational and gives you no sense of the character, really. Sure, you pick up that America feels he's bad because his abusive foster uncle told him so. You pick up on the fact that he's given up on so many things he could have succeeded in easily. His love of his foster mother, his bitterness towards his uncle. He admits to murder and arson, living with a strange man who sells shoelaces.<br />It's all just too bizarre to follow and lacks the passion that was in Life is Funny. It trivializes the matter of being sexually abused and ends with no sense of actually ending. It's a nice thought that America (so named because his mother slept with so many men she figured anyone in America could be his father) could come through his pre-adolescent abuse so easily, but all in all, America's audience is limited, it's style is weak, and it's subject is too harsh.<br />Better luck next time.	2002-04-29

When Nick's girlfriend Caitlin finally files charges agaisnt him for abuse, Nick makes a complete turnaround. While I find such complete revelations virtually impossible, it feels refreshing to read that there is help for people like Nick and Caitlin and that sometimes the things you love most, you have to let go of.<br />It's touching, inspiring and absolutely wonderful.	2002-04-06

When I went looking for a new book a few months ago, I knew I wanted something a little different, something exciting and unique.

For a day I took this book everywhere, I just couldn't stop reading it. The thrill is top notch and the ending is both surprising, yet it all ties in well to the clues.<br />The thing that struck me most about the book was the obvious talent of the author to take on a female lead character and express her every hope, fear or wish so completely. Her strength and determination are inspiring, her personality is lovable yet harsh at the appropriate times. It's a true credit to Mr. Allen's profession as an author that he's so willing to take on such a risk, while the well-known male authors of our time tend to only write about male characters. <br />This book is a work of intense suspense, supreme fiction and gets in some remarkable looks at life.

My first was \\"Skipping Christmas\\" which got great reviews but I thought was just average or worse. There was no mystery, no thrilling plot, no murders up around the bend. How anyone could think that book is better than this one is beyond me.<br />As a novel, it's not typical. It doesn't contain thousands of pages of padding and useless character development. You're thrust into the life of Ray Atlee who receives a \\"summons\\" from his father, a retired judge who still believes he owns the small town of Clanton. <br />When Ray arrives, he find his father napping on the sofa, but a closer look reveals that Judge Atlee is dead. Supposedly from cranking up his own morphine pack.<br />When Ray finds $3.2 million in the Judge's cabinet, the book takes off. Rattling doorknobs, freaky notes with no return address (that contain cryptic messages such as \\"You don't need an aiplane, quite spending the money\\" or photos of the storage place where Ray is hiding the money.<br />It had a good ending (though I personally suspected the guilty party the entire time), it had enough plot twists along the way to convince me I was wrong.<br />I think this is a miserably underrated book, and one of the finest mysteries I've read in a long time. It might not compare to The Brethren, but it  has Grisham's signature of simple writing and believable plots. Take the book for what it is, don't try to make it something too fantastic to be believed.	2002-03-27

I read this late last summer and thought it was cute, but it didn't change my preconceived notions that leprechauns simply don't exist. <br />When the author decides she will take a vacation to rediscover her Irish roots and take a break from everyday stress, we discover immediately that she has not had the best of mental health in the past, herself. Taking that into consideration might explain the commonplace descriptions of the leprechauns- as though she's been seeing them all her life.<br />Reading this would convince one that perhaps she HAS.<br />Tanis not only speaks to the family of leprechauns, but also the other spirits. She goes shopping with them, shares her cabin with all sorts of fantastic creatures a five-year-old would delight in reading about. As the book progresses, it just begins to irritate those of us who are \\"denser\\" than Ms,. Helliwell (I know not her current marital status). Because she's so willing to believe in the supernatural, she's therefore able to see and communicate with them.<br />According to her, the leprechauns have become her friends and still visit her periodically! They're the reason she's written this book. To tell us mortals (what does she believe herself to be?) that we should not eat lettuce because it screams when it's uprooted. (I swear to you, this is ACTUALLY in the book, mentioned several times.)<br />For what it's worth, the book is charming and quaint fiction. As a realistic look at the supernatural, it's simply not up to par. Read it if you'd like a refreshing work of fiction or a nice break from your typical gory Stephen King cold-blooded murder mystery. For something about the supernatural, keep looking. Even the most open-minded reader would find this exceedingly difficult to believe.	2002-03-17

The plot incorporates three different stories and ties them all together... strangely. However, it seemed to me that anyone reading of \\"the motherless boy\\" a.k.a. Curtis and his escapes from his mother's killers' brutality would easily tie to abused, neglected and disabled Leilani. Why the incorporation of so many children in this one? <br />Then there's the plot of Michelina Bellsong, abused as a young girl. Her sudden revelation seems unlikely (even if small). The incorporation of her character is understandable, I suppose, but seems somewhat unnecessary.<br />As miracles go, the one of Extra Terrestrials is to be used only sparingly. This book seems overly padded and underly interesting, of course I never was a fan of sci-fi. While it does offer an exciting plot, I prefer my books a little more realistic.	2002-03-11

What did I get?<br />The plot is based on the \\"dark vibes\\" coming from the Nutcracker Inn, owned by Qwill's friends the Bambas. Well, as fiction, it's EXTREMELY bad. Why does she include information on the mosquitoes and go absolutely nowhere with it? Koko's eccentricities even got on my nerves halfway through. What happened to all Koko's helpfulness in this one, anyway?  <br />As a mystery, it's possibly worse than it is as a fiction. From the first murder, it's quite obvious who the perpetrator is (to me, anyway). While Qwilleran should be investigating these crimes, he prefers to spend his long days without his love interest Polly Duncan watching bad school plays, poor reenactments and drab operas. Is this a true crime reporter? Did Qwill lose every aspect of his old personality?<br />Well, the book has a lot of loose ends and an extremely poor plot. (Why do we include the walnut furniture if it has nothing to do with anything?) I got the feeling, the entire time I was reading this, that it wasn't even a Lilian Jackson Braun novel. This would disappoint any prospective fan of her work, I'd suggest to new readers that they get my personal favorite \\"The Cat Who Ate Danish Modern\\" (her first one). THAT was an excellent mystery. Sorry Ms. Braun, but I'm going to have to agree with the masses: You've gotten yourself a ghost writer to do these!

I got this book after reading the GREAT book \\"Hope Was Here,\\" in hopes that this would be similar. Well, it was. Too similar for me. The plot follows Jenna, a teen just dealing with the problems of impending adulthood. Her father has always been an alcoholic, when he comes back to town after her parents' divorce, Jenna is faced with all the problems of her early life again. <br />Jenna works at Gladstone's Shoes, when owber Mrs. Gladstone notices Jenna's exemplary work, she offers Jenna a job as her driver. What awaits is a summer of discovery. <br />For all that, it's a great book. But, if you compare this to Bauer's \\"Hope Was Here,\\" it's practically the same plot: You can try running away from your problems, they stay with you anyway. Just when you start to realize how good a person is, they die. And for some people, there's just no reformation. It's the identical plot, practically word for word, with a mask of different characters and a slightly altered situation. I'd recommend reading this, it is very entertaining.

She feels like her family doesn't want her?<br />I don't think so. <br />The plot begins in \\"Sick Minds\\" (a mental hospital otherwise known as Sea Pines though there's no sea or pines), Callie refuses to speak (Reminds me of the good novel \\"Speak-\\" almost identical given the fact that this reads like I wrote it.) and is threatened that she will be forced to leave if she doesn't cooperate.<br />There is so little character development, you can predict the triteness from the time you begin the book: yet you can't pull away. From the beginning, it's as though Callie is carrying a heavy burden, but we never figure out WHAT. It gets annoying and you have to put it down. <br />I think it is worth reading, it's very easy reading for a rainy day, and fun fiction. For real issues dealing with teen cutting, I'd look elsewhere. This simply isn't realistic.	2002-02-22

The heartbreaking, straight to the point verse in which it's written cuts right through you. As Jolly loses her job to \\"Mr. Fingers Boss\\" and has to find some way to support the family, Verna shows her the love nobody else ever has. She fights off cockroaches and makes up songs for the kids, scrubs the floor. She even takes Jeremy for shoes and pays for them because Jolly can't.

I thought I would not be interested in the plot or (even worse) hate it altogether. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. The book is a sort of diary outlet for the lead character \\"Charlie\\" (That could be his real name, and it could not). Charlie writes to his \\"friend\\" quite often as his life becomes increasingly complicated. He looks at life with a refined wisdom and a long line of new feelings every day, he has an undeniable innocence and a good character development. <br />The book is tragic in a way. I won't spoil the ending for those who haven't read it, but it is heartbreaking to realize why his character is the way it is. On the way to all that sadness, however, are some wonderful times with his friends Patrick and Sam and a lot of the usual self-discovery themes. The book tends to revolve upon Charlie's school reading assignments, and there are often veiled references to characters and plots from the stories mentioned. <br />The perspective on life is fresh and light, with very little unnecassry information to drag down the plot. It's a book very similar to The Princess Diaries or \\"Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging,\\" yet keeps a very clear and refreshing plot. This is a book every teen would enjoy.	2002-02-12

It is the second book in the Make Lemonade series (I highly recommend the original as well) and has been highly anticipated for 8  years. <br />The lead character (LaVaughn) is a typical fifteen-year-old. She's unsure of herself, loyal to friends she doesn't necessarily like that much and downright confused about the person she wants to become. Her father died when she was very young and she and her mother have had to struggle to survive ever since.

Because it's written on a lower reading level than \\"The Giver,\\" it was considered a fatal choice for a time. Then interest began to resurface. That's when I discovered this book.<br />Gathering Blue is futuristic look at society, similar to The Giver. It follows the life of Kira, whose mother has just died at the beginning of the story. It obvious almost immediately that Kira is different, she is disabled. Since most disabled people are killed at birth in her soceity, life becomes an unbearable struggle after her mother's death. <br />Her father, apparently killed during a hunt shortly after Kira's birth, has eluded her throughout her life and she often feels empowered by .... something to weave spectacular cloths. <br />When she is threatened by some women of the village for her land, Kira feels as though her life is over, but a great amount of luck is in store for her, thanks to her remarkable sewing/weaving abilities.<br />Kira soon discovers that the tenants of the building she is allowed to live in have similar stories to hers. She faces a very difficult decision at the end of the book: Be forced to live in a society where you might be able to change things, or simply go to a society where you will be accepted.

But as things focus more on Shayla, Tia, and their mother and grandmother, it takes strong motivation just to get the next chapter.<br />Worth skimming, but not a favorite.	2002-01-13

When a friend suggested it, I thought &quot;Oh, why not?&quot; and am very glad I did. The plot follows Annie Darling, who owns a mystery novel shop (Death on Demand) and her husband Max. When Annie's father finally shows after deserting Annie and her mother so many years ago.. the plot thickens. Annie is thrown in the middle of a (somewhat corny, and only slightly suspenseful) mystery with bland clues and very few plot twists. I was a bit surprised by the ending, but looking back, I really wasn't paying much attention. I was trying to be a &quot;filter&quot; and not a &quot;sponge&quot; and in this case, it was a bad decision. <br />Well worth reading, but more a work of fiction than a murder mystery novel.	2001-12-26
US	47851619	R2RZ5YMJSAN1JZ	0769293034	919504095	Christina Aguilera	Books	5	5	5	N	N	THIS IS SHEET MUSIC!	First and foremost, THIS IS NOT A BIO OF CHRISTINA AGUILERA, IT IS SHEET MUSIC! If you are looking for a bio of Christina, try Molly MacDermont's, it's informative and a quick read. <br /> This is a nicely put-together collection of Christina's songs, all bound up in a beautiful color introduction book. This includes all of her songs from her debut disc, including hits such as &quot;What A Girl Wants,&quot; &quot;Reflection,&quot; &quot;Genie In A Bottle,&quot; &quot;I Turn to You&quot; and the original (no rap) &quot;Come On Over.&quot; It also has some wonderful non-single tracks like &quot;When You Put Your Hands on Me&quot; and Christina's favorite of the album, the soulful &quot;Obvious.&quot; <br /> While I have several of these books for different artists (BSB, *NSYNC, Britney Spears, Mariah Carey and of course Christina), this is perhaps the most stunning because this one includes an introduction from the man who &quot;discovered&quot; Christina. It's very informative and a wonderful source of info for hardcore fans like myself. <br /> Some of the songs are excellent (if a bit on the difficult level), while other lack proper keys, there are several obvious mistakes in this book, and a few not-so obvious.<br />If nothing else, it's a wonderful guide to her lyrics and vocal arrangements and an informative behhind the scenes look at the album, the song selections, and the fun of putting it together! A must for any fan.	2001-12-19

It was one of the hardest books I ever finished, and not because it was written in a difficult manner, not because it was boring, because it was one of my favorite books, I loved the characters too much to part with them.<br /> In this book, Spinelli uses several techniques to make Stargirl stand apart from everyone. From the way she dresses and behaves to the way she brings her pets to school with her, this girl stands apart from everyone.<br /> The lead character, a quiet observer, falls in love with Stargirl and they start to date. After endless ridicule, Stargirl's friendly, free-spirited nature is crushed as she tries to become &quot;Evelyn Everybody.&quot; <br /> The story offers an important rule: You have to be who are inside to be happy. No clothing can hide who you are and self-suppression is over rated! Though the book makes home schooled kids look like freaks (we're not! We're really not!), it also displays that perhaps it's best to follow your own path instead of the one everyone else is.	2001-12-18

First off I want to say that I DID enjoy reading this book very much. It offers a lot of &quot;solutions&quot; to teenage problems (relationships, death of a friend, family etc) and at times was very interesting. <br /> So why the three stars?<br />Well, the book follows the lives of four friends (Tibby, Bridget, Carmen and Lena) as they travel the world on summer vacations- sort of. The plot is well on the lame side, if you can't tell from the title. The &quot;magic&quot; of the pants is that they fit all four girls-wow! Can you imagine THAT? (I wonder how many people in the world are size 5?) <br /> The plot is hard to follow at times, the switch between characters isn't smooth, and at times it's so boring it's hard to continue. So why the hype? Let's face it, compared to a Grisham novel, this has nothing. Compared to J.R. Lankford's &quot;The Crowning Circle,&quot; it's even less. This book is overhyped and the author is overrated. While Louise Rennison and Meg cabot know how to write a book that will appeal to teenage girls, Ann could use a little help. Better luck next time.	2001-12-18

Luther, the main character, decides that since his daughter has joined the Peace Corps, he will skip the holiday and go on a cruise with his wife. What follows are weeks of satire, ostracism and disappointment.<br /> Though written by typical Grisham standards, the book fails to deliver somehow. I just don't feel the effort in this book that I  felt in &quot;A Painted House&quot; or &quot;A Time to Kill,&quot; because it is so short. There is no research on the author's part to further back the time period. Despite that, I like the idea of, instead of tauting Christmas as the hap-happiest time of the year, displaying it as a money-maker that leaves you with a sea of people all holding their hands out. A bit of a disappointing ending, but you smile nontheless.	2001-12-17

After all the hype and all the praise, I expected something more informative and more outrageous.<br /> The book covers the history of bioterrorism in a cheap, cheesy, slapped together at the last minute approach to a very suspenseful novel.<br /> It does give information on possible biological weapons, and their effects on the human body, but lists them in a helter-scelter fashion. That's all well and good as an attempt to keep the reader interested, but does very little if you want quick facts. A table of germs would have been nice, and THEN they could have listed every possible way to deliver them, when they've been used, and when they were discovered.<br /> Overall, it's written blandly and reads like a text book despite the editors' attempts to dress it up. Judith Miller has been preaching the bioterror sermon for a long time, and this book shows what has been on her mind. Though it's being acclaimed as something extraordinary, it's really just mediocre at best.	2001-11-25

Reading just one chapter shows the author's incredible writing abilities. Hope is a 16-year-old &quot;city girl&quot; who has been working in the food industry since she was fourteen. Her mother, incapable of raising Hope appropriately gave Hope to her Aunt Addie as a baby. <br /> Hope's childhood was rocky for more reasons than her birth name (Tulip), she and her Aunt  Addie are always on the move from town to town until the diner at which they're employed is run out of business or worse. With only occaisional appearances from her mother, Hope has grown to become an independant. <br /> The adventure begins when Addie and Hope leave the New York diner where they've been for several years for a small town in Wisconson. There, a cast of delightful characters come to life so vividly, you feel as though you've known them your entire life.<br /> G.T., the short order cook and owner of the new diner announces that he is running for mayor during a parade, making Hope's life even more hectic. There's plenty for everyone, adventure, love, anger, loss, and hapiness. A must read.	2001-11-25

It shifts from character to character for a greater perspective of life.

Well, to begin, though there are a few reviews on here saying that the book is stereotypical and prejudice, I don't see it. The book deals with daily life in Greenwich Village, New York and follows the life of fourteen-year-old Amelia Thermopoils. &quot;Mia,&quot; as she likes to be called has a very eccentric and quirky personality, the more you read, the more you love her. From her vegetarianism to her devotion to Greenpeace, Mia never fails to surprise with her fast-paced, directly contradictory thoughts. <br /> Mia's life is filled with several twists and turns, such as her mother (famous contemporary painter Helen Thermopolis) dating Mia's Algebra teacher, &quot;Mr. G.&quot; Algebra, the subject Mia is flunking.<br /> Mia's father has been struggling with cancer, and after much chemotherapy, it's discovered that he can't have any more children. And Mia is therefore told she is the heir to the throne of Genovia. <br /> After much resistance, Mia must go through with &quot;princess lessons&quot; with her French grandmother who treats Mia with little respect and still less appreciation.<br /> There are the typical day to day teenage happenings; dates, new friends, first kisses, friendships in trouble, the reformation of paradigms about everyone and everything around her- all leading through several plot twists and eventually coming to a very happy resoltion.<br />    I recommend this book to anyone with a sense of humor. If you can't take a joke or can't remember what being fourteen was all about, it probably isn't for you. If you do like this book, be sure to read the (much better) &quot;Princess Diaries Volume II: Princess in the Spotlight,&quot; &quot;Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging&quot; and &quot;On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God.&quot;	2001-09-22

From Grandma Dowdel's relationship with her neighbors, her trigger-happiness, and her eccentric personality, she's just about the most lovable character I've read about lately. <br /> The book includes everything a book should; humour, adventure, drama, and real life situations.     Peck is a very talented author, deserving the awards his book has received, but this is more children's lit than teen lit. Still, I would recommend it to everyone, it's a great summer book, and the easy reading level makes it a quick read. Check it out, I think you'll like it.	2001-07-14

Fans of this book should definitely read &quot;Native Son&quot; and the other way around.<br /> Steve is on trial for murder. Being called a &quot;monster&quot; and the worst part is, even HE isn't sure that he's not a monster.    The way the book is written, taking place during the event, might sound like a bad way to write a book. In this case, it works. The flashbacks don't feel like flashbacks, as they are written separately from the trial. And the writing is superb. Alternating from a play script to Steve's diary entries keeps the reader fascinated, and makes the book very unique.<br /> While I see nothing really offensive in this one, most kids under twelve won't understand the depth of the writing, and the serious nature of the book. I don't think there is really a specific age group for which this is written, though. If you're over twelve, I think you'll find this quite interesting.	2001-07-14

After I was contacted by the authoress herself, I couldn't resist picking a copy up.       The plot line follows various murder mysteries in a small, non-existant Ohio town, all leading up to a big finish. I swear, I am addicted to this book. The minute I received it, I could not put it down, I carried it to the school cafeteria, the dinner table, I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning just to see how it ended. Of course, I had quite a few nightmares, but they were well worth it.  I stil read my favorite parts practically daily.      The book shows real promise for its author, the way the chapters flow smoothly, yet incorporate so many different characters. It is a masterpiece, a work of art, literally breathtaking. I recommend this to anyone and everyone, no matter what their taste in literature. It is what I would term an &quot;Ultimate Thriller&quot; with lots of surprises along the way.	2001-05-30

It takes 120 pages just to get to that point. They go through all these trials and tribulations while setting up and getting situated, on and on and on. By the time I reached the end, (it took some serious self-motivation,) I felt confused. After all the hype, all the wonderful things everyone says, this book is a sham.

The book has it's fresh points, it's weak points, and a few surprises along the way. Tan did something very refreshing, however, she added two books within a book. The character Ruth's life story is the focus of the book. When a grim fact is discovered about her mother, Ruth decides it is time to investigate LuLing's life. In the book is a memoir of LuLing's life and her &quot;nursemaid&quot; (I won't say more than that for now,) Precious Auntie. The book deals with the very real emotions of caring for the elderly.

Though this book proved to be helpful when we first bought our new crean point, what struck me is that it doesn't discuss most of the details of cat owning nor does it really give detailed descriptions of illness. We had never had a cat before. How would we know if the darned thing is sick when we bring it home? This book was supposed to help with that, but it only skims illnesses in kittens and cats and spends most of the time discussing showing your new Himalayan. Anyone reading this would be reading it for help on training, diet suggestions and just basic &quot;Cats for Dummies&quot; sort of stuff. While it does offer excellent photos of rare cats and features extra glossy pages making it fun to flip through, it needs more of a point. So Himalayans throw up when they eat grass, any cat will. tell me something I wouldn't know that is unique to long haired or Himalayan cats and kittens, like the watery eyes and constant infections. How to deal with fleas and ticks and how to tell worms would have been nice if they were just doing a a generalized book, but in most aspects you know nothing more on completing this than you did before.

(Generation Girl)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	One of the Best Gen Girl Books	Being an enormous fan of Melanie Stewart's work, I have read all of her books, but this is superior to all but one. (#4, Singing Sensation is tops, in my book.) The writing demonstrated here is much better than most of the other books, though.    The story follows Lara Morelli-Strauss, a fifteen-year-old girl who's father is German, Mother is Italian, and the family just moved to New York from Paris, France. Lara has made five best friends from different corners of the world, and is adapting well, Mama is a fashion designer and always can just throw herself into a new life full throttle, but Lara's father does not adapt as easily. Dr. Strauss likes lots of quiet, lots of time to  sit and think or to study a book.    Lara's mother and father start having fights more often and more furiously than before, everything starts to bug them about one another. Lara wonders why they're acting weird, but she is so focused on an upcoming art competition, she can ignore the stress around her with ease- for a while. Until her parents start hiding the fights when she enters the room, Lara knows something is going down, but she can't figure out what. For a while, she is distracted by the idea that film star Troy Marcus has been nominated for &quot;Principal for A Day&quot;- and accepted!    When her parents announce a split-up, Lara runs away, writes notes to her friends, but, unbenounced to her, they never get them. This leads poor, emotional Lara to a feeling of being deserted by everyone. Is there any way everything can work out? <br />The best thing about the first Generation Girl books: Lots of sub-plots. They  follow many adventures of many of the girls at once. The raw emotion in this book leads me to believe the authoress herself has gone through a parental split-up, (I just gave away the ending, didn't I?) I have and believe me when I say you can only express these feelings if you've lived them. This is one of Stewart's greatest works, and since it's approx. only a 110 pgs,it makes a great weekend read. It will tug heart strings, fill you with digust and hatred toward the pompous movie star and make you appreciate what you have. It's just terrific.	2000-12-11

This book, the first in the series, follows Barbie's adventures. (Each book follows a different girl) This is the perfect beginner book and I read my favorite parts of it about every day. Barbie moves away from her comfy, sheltered home in California and into an apartment with friends of her parents' all the way across the country in NY. Barbie encounters a very outspoken girl on a subway while trying to get a seat for an elderly gentleman. The girl helps Barbie get a seat, but then vanishes as mysteriously as she appeared. Later, Barbie's first friend is robbed of one of her most treasured possesions, her paint box. Barbie sees the girl she met on the subway skating away with the box and knows there must be a mistake, but is it worth risking her friendship to not report the girl?<br />Meanwhile, life is flying at a typical New York pace, Barbie has been offered a spot in a commercial, met more friends and is trying to keep in touch with her family back home. <br />This is a book you've got to read not because it's the introductory book but because there's always something fascinating going on. As for the resolution, well, you're just going to have to read the book!	2000-12-04

I would say neither Britney nor her mom REALLY wrote anything here. Sheryl Berk, the so-called contrbutor did it all.  If you've ever heard Britney speak, you'll know what I mean. Let's get serious here: First off, what self respecting mother lets her daughter run around in tube tube tops and mini skirts (Neither of which really serve ANY purpose.) and second off, if Britney is so busy, how could she possibly have the time to write an autobiography. There are some amazing pictures here. I especially like the one where Brit's eating a cookie and I love the one side by side with Christina, but the writing is WWAAAYYY under par and there doesn't seem to be any real purpose in writing this. Just to tell what a swell relationship Brit has with her Mama, and how &quot;Totally happy&quot; they are. Barf-o! (I especially liked where Britney asked her Mama if there were cows in New York. I thought, &quot;Oh, I see, she was always a bright child.&quot;)  I like how there are examples of poor grammar in nearly every chapter and best of all how you feel that after reading it, you don't know anything you didn't before and feel no new emotions about Britney, her career, OR her mom. I'm giving it four stars because I like Britney, and I think the pictures are all good. I also think that, with time, it could have been a better book. But at 18 with just two CD's out, it all seems like a bad idea to me.	2000-10-25

It was Lilian Jackson Braun's claim to fame, her very first book. Though it is a little predictable, you will find the plot pleasing, with just enough turns to keep you guessing until finally reaching  a compelling  conclusion. Qwill remeets an old flame, gets assigned a new beat as food critic, gets to move into a fabulous apartment, but he still isn't satisfied. (If you ask me, the Moose County Something might as well just give Qwill the crime beat, it always takes his moustache to solve all the Moose County crimes anyway!)  I think this is my second favorite &quot;Cat Who..&quot; book because it not only debuted the famous series, it interested the publice enough to KEEP READING! Not very many writers can go as long as Lil did without publishing a book, only to become a smash hit AGAIN. If you're loo king for a first &quot;Cat Who..&quot; This is great. It introduces the characters nicely and makes you feel more acquainted. It also makes later works easier to follow.	2000-10-25

It tells everything from what note she had to hit to get the part in &quot;Mulan,&quot; how she and Britney Spears feel about one another, her favorite words and clothes, how she does her makeup, even what brush she  combs her hair with! Molly really got her facts straight and put together a great Christina book. It's particularly good if you just want to know you're Christina trivia fast. There's even a quiz in the back! Don't wait one more second on this, GO FOR IT!!!	2000-10-25

She always keeps gross and explicit things out of her books and trails the adventures of Jim Qwilleran and his two Siamese Ka'o Ko Kung (Uh, Koko for short), the male cat, and Yum Yum, the female. In this particular book, Qwill is in for many surprises and Mrs. Braun did a great job. The  suspense builds until the last couple of chapter where the climax and falling action leave you too ecited to put the book down.  An elaborate plan by a criminal and his kleptomaniac &quot;wife&quot; leave Moose County in a swirl of confusion until Qwill reveals the real intentions of the dashing decorater. A must read!	2000-10-24

This is the most touching read EVER! And I'm not a just stupid teenager, so don't give me a negative over that! I have read Steinback, Alcott, Salinger, Frost, Kipling, all of Dickens's novels and had an extensive personal library of award winning children's literature when I was younger (Which I recently had the pleasure of cleaning out, thanks a lot mom.) and this is by far the best of any of them. It is based on Barbies, but it's also based on real girls. Everyday life is difficult today for teens. Adults don't understand it, they see everything as trivial and meaningless and I suppose it might seem that way, but in our society, every little task is a duty to prepare us for adulthood. It's a duty to remain a clean and descent person. Not to give into drugs, sex, violence. Even though it might seem like no problem at all to an adult, everything has a deeper, more symbolic meaning now.  In this, my favorite of all the Generation Girl books, Chelsie Peterson, an exchange student from London is nominated by her friends to write a school musical. Chelsie performs one of her songs for her friends and they think it's depressing. A major fiasco in the teenage world. (Uh, they don't understand her, YOU GET IT?)  Chelsie's father is a British diplomat, and is seldom there for her. Chelsie's mother has neve bonded much with her daughter and therefore Chelsie feels alone. She is afraid to tell her mom about her friends for fear that her mother will find them unsuitable. So, she hides them.  After a big fight with her friends, Chelsie comes across a letter from a boarding school in England. The same one her mother attended.  Days before the set date to return to England, Chelsie's friend take her out for a day on the town in New York City. She wears a crazy outfit and for the first time in her life, just gets to be herself.  The day before the date scheduled on the one way ticket to misery. Chelsie's mom still hasn't even brought it up, and Chelsie just doesn't know what to do. She tries talking, but her mother sees the outrageous outfit and sentances her to the good old fashioned upbringing. Chelsie's dad is millions of miles away and no one can save or help her. It's up to her friends to pull this one off, there are lots of tears throughout the book, even if you're not usually touched by books (Like me) this one will have you sniffling right along with the lead characters. The ending will make you cry a river, but you'll enjoy every moment of it!	2000-10-18

Women of all ages can and will relate to the follies of the little women. From burnt hair to boy troubles to feeling stupid and made into a fool, we've all been there and experienced it in some form or another. My favorite chapter is actually the first one (Though I can recite any passage from any chapter of the book word for word.) A Merry Christmas introduces us to the characters and show the unity and support in American families during the Civil War. Dark Days has you feeling the worst is around the corner, but then some sun peeks through the ice encrusted tree limbs. And though The Valley of Shadow brings about darker days yet, good things come of them, and in the end, life is beautiful! It doesn't matter what your usual style of reading material is, this is by far the greatest work ever published. I have this particular copy and there are about four or five exquisite full color drawings inside and some truly magnificent sketches, aslo. Don't even consider waiting one more second to pick this one up, whether you're a long time fan who's been looking for the perfect copy or a new reader, trust me when I say you will want this one longer than any library in the country will allow it out. Enjoy!	2000-10-18

Then, in the fall, these books came out and I was hooked on all things Gen Girl. This is a favorite for anybody into sports or who's feeling overwhelmed and like they can't overcome something in their lives. In this story, Ana Suarez meets a guy, gets pushed by a girl, sprains her ankle, breaks up with a guy, gets back with the guy, the same girl that pushed her becomes her personal coach, and Ana still goes on to compete in three Olympic sports. Whew! This girl is busy. But never too bust for her friends, Barbie Roberts, Blaine Gordon, Chelsie Peterson, Lara Morelli-Strauss, Nichelle Williams and Tori Burns. This is a book that always keeps you guessing and has a great, though somewhat predictable ending. Even though this says it's not for ages over 12, that is sooo untrue. It's a great weekend read for older girls, too. Don't feel embarrassed or even hesitate to try this book. It's not my personal favorite in the series but well worth a good look. So? What are you waiting for?	2000-10-18
