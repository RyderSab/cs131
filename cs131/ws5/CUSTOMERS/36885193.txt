From 1941 until the end of the war the Americans and British collaborated ? in a sometimes prickly relationship ? with the desperate task of deciphering the messages sent between German U-boats in the North Atlantic and Grossadmiral Karl D?nitz, commander-in-chief of the German Navy. Fortunately for the allies, the admiral liked to keep in close touch with his fleet of U-boats, providing a steady stream of messages with clues to the U-boats? position and intentions.        <br /> <br />In 1939, with Germany threatening to invade Poland, the Polish had turned over to their British and French allies all the work they had done during the previous nine years on the ciphers generated by a machine called an ?Enigma? that the Germans used to send secret messages. The Polish artifacts included a mechanical device called a ?bomba kryptologiczna?, or ?bombe? in French. In response, the British set up a Code and Cypher School (note the British spelling of cipher) at Bletchley Park. That story has been well told many times and the contributions of at least some of the men and women who served there ? most notably the mathematician Alan Turing ? have been publicly recognized. <br /> <br />In the United States much of the code breaking was done in Dayton, Ohio, by NCR in cooperation with the US Navy. The Bombes used in the US were designed and constructed in Building 26 under the leadership of engineer Joe Desch. Desch was one of many people who have never received proper acknowledgement for their work during the World War II because of the tight security surrounding their duties. Putting together their story has been a labor of love for Dayton reporter, Jim DeBrosse, and security historian Colin Burke. Be warned that there is very little about the technical aspects of Enigma encryption in ?The Secret in Building 26?, but there is a wealth of information about the men and women who worked ? often for years of long, hard days and under tremendous strain ? for the love of their country.	2004-07-21

In History Lessons, a philologist and a historian walk us through US history as it is presented to high school children in 28 other countries by their history textbooks. For each of 50 topics that normally appear in US junior or senior high school history books, the authors have located about a page of text from one or several foreign books that address the specified topic. <br /> We start by learning about Viking Exploration as it is taught to children from Norway and Canada, work our way through the American Revolution as taught to the British, slavery as taught to Nigerians, World Wars I and II as taught to Germans, visit Cuba and Vietnam, and end up in the Philippines, North Korea and the Middle East, as taught to young Israelis and Saudis. But this isn?t history as Americans are taught it, the land of the free and the brave, the land of Free Trade. This is a country that is positively alien, where Americans are often the bad guys to be resisted and mistrusted. How can this be? <br />Those of us ? from wherever we came ? who have read the history of our countries in foreign books have passed through a series of emotions: denial, anger and (if we?re lucky) understanding. Every child everywhere in the world is taught at school that he or she comes from the most important, most heroic and most humane country in the world. Our parents and teachers said so, therefore it must be true. The difficulty comes when we leave our home country and find that others don?t have the same benign attitude to us. That is a hard enough transition for an individual. When two countries face each other, as the US and Iraq have recently, there is the potential for wholesale confusion and misunderstanding. It is incredibly hard to rethink such basic facts about our identity as those we were taught as children. It is harder still to comprehend how those foreigners could allow themselves to be cuckolded into believing such lies about us. History Lessons won?t entirely resolve this difficulty, but it does make a starting point for understanding how people worldwide can have such contradictory ideas about the ?facts? of history.<br />Taking 50 topics from Viking Exploration through New World Order, Dana Lindaman and Kyle Ward show how that subject is treated by one or more countries. The entire list of countries comprises Brazil, Canada, Caribbean, China, Costa Rica, Cuba, France, Germany, Great Britain, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Nigeria, N Korea, Norway, Philippines, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, S Korea, Spain, Syria, Vietnam and Zimbabwe. The authors have restricted their comments to a very short introduction to each section. This minimizes ? but does not entirely eliminate ? their own biases on the topic and lets us read the excerpts with fresh eyes, just as schoolchildren do.   <br />Although the US is at center stage of this book, there is no suggestion that historical events involving the United States are any more prone to misreporting by foreign textbooks than are events involving any other country. Nor is there any suggestion that US textbooks are any more ? or less ? accurate than the textbooks of any other country. The authors claim that political correctness has reduced US textbooks to ?a series of inoffensive facts and figures,? but the excerpts in the book suggest that this is a worldwide failing. Few, if any, of the passages are engaging and only the Nigerian book quoted seems to assume any intelligence on the part of students. <br />What is not included in History Lessons is any kind of statistical analysis. The authors have not made a survey of world textbooks; they do not claim that the passages quoted are in any sense typical ? or atypical ? of their continents or political regimes. They do say that most countries have some kind of centralized control over school textbooks, so that these passages come from either the only book available to students, or at least one that meets standardized guidelines. Depressingly, nowhere in the world are children exposed to a wide variety of views. None of the statements in the books seem open to debate, even when their authors piously invite their young readers to ?discuss? the topic. <br />The natural readers of History Lessons are high school history teachers and teachers at schools with immigrant children. But the book will have the greatest value if we can let our children read it at an age when their minds are still open to new and diverse ideas. The aim is not to teach them that US textbooks are ?wrong?, but that we need to look elsewhere than received wisdom to find what is common to humanity.	2004-07-19

For over a thousand years, Europe was the victim of a series of epidemics which decimated the population. One of the last of these epidemics was the Great Plague of London in 1665 that killed probably a third of the population and left few families untouched.<br />Plagues are a huge subject. Even today there is little agreement between medical experts as to which pandemics were caused by Yersinia pestis (the bacillus almost certainly responsible for the 1665 plague); what was the contagiousness and morbidity of the various strains of plague; and what were all the ways that it could be transmitted to humans. Then there are all the complicated social questions to sort out: What was cause, what effect, and what coincidence? All this has to be carefully determined from the artifacts left by a largely superstitious and semi-literate society in desperate times. <br />The husband and wife team of Lloyd and Dorothy Moote have pooled their skills in European history and medical research to examine the human side of the Great Plague. By going back to original source materials, they have provided an intimate picture of life during the plague year that is as free as possible from the myths and misunderstandings that have grown up around the subject. Most valuably, their interpretation of events is sensitive to the knowledge and beliefs of the people at the time. This was an afflicted community only three hundred years after the Black Death - one of the world's greatest horrors - and two hundred years before scientists such as Filippo Pacini, Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch would connect disease to an &quot;organic, living substance of a parasitic nature.&quot;<br />Other books on the plague have tended to concentrate on the epidemiological and political aspects of pandemics. &quot;The Great Plague: The Story of London's Most Deadly Year&quot; is a very welcome addition to the literature because of its careful and sympathetic treatment of the human side of plague.	2004-07-13

London is \\"sordid\\", Mexico City is a \\"hypertrophied organism\\", Las Vegas a \\"dubious urbanoid organism\\", Atlanta is a \\"galaxy of Edge City projects tied together by freeways and gruesome collector streets.\\" Paris, Boston, Berlin and Rome don't fare much better. Good golly, it almost makes you wonder why we city-dwellers have actually chosen to live here. <br />A book subtitled \\"Notes\\" is entitled to be personal, random and subjective. Taken as such, there's a good deal here to inform, entertain and warn: Just don't expect objectivity or sensible suggestions for improvement. Kunstler sees the urban future given over to \\"tarantulas, buzzards and rats.\\" But many of we city-dwellers live where we do because of the complicated histories behind our places of abode and the disordered messiness of the buildings, streets, parks and people. \\"The City in Mind\\" feeds that craving by telling some genuinely interesting stories about the background of these cities. <br />Kunstler uses Rome to digress on classical architecture, Mexico City to retell the history of Mexican Indian civilization and its effect on modern urban bureaucracy, and Berlin to tie a community's self-image to its choice of architecture. The problem is that, since he concentrates only on a few aspects of each city's development - and usually negative aspects, at that - readers not personally familiar with these cities are going to get a very distorted view of them. I know most of these cities, I've lived in more than one, but I still don't trust the picture presented of the couple I haven't personally visited.<br />At least one can't accuse the author of a foolish consistency. The chapter on Mexico City describes in some sympathetic detail the possible reasons behind the Aztecs' docility in the face of Spanish assault. But another chapter fails to identify the exact same phenomenon in Atlanta suburbanites who are faced with the carnage caused by automobiles sharing space with humans. He condemns Boston's plan to use the 27-acre site over the Big Dig for a huge \\"open space\\", but is as \\"shocked\\" as a Victorian maiden when startled by another man enjoying London's Hampstead Heath who steps into his path from behind one of the trees in a \\"thicket of real woods.\\"      <br />I suspect that most of the negative reviews of this book have come from people who have seen their favorite cities gored by Kunstler. It's fine for us to complain about our cities, is the attitude, but we just don't appreciate visitors from Saratoga Springs doing the same thing. That's unnecessarily defensive. Our cities have burned to the ground (Atlanta and London), been bombed into smithereens (Berlin), and fallen on hard times (Rome and Paris). They will survive a curmudgeon.	2004-07-08
US	36885193	R1BZ7S7HTG4Z3J	1560255927	625564077	Blood, Class and Empire: The Enduring Anglo-American Relationship (Nation Books)	Books	3	19	30	N	N	The transatlantic bond as a dysfunctional relationship	\\"Blood, Class and Empire\\" was originally published in 1990. This is a reissue with a new forward dated October, 2003, but with no other changes identified.  That explains a lot. Christopher Hitchens has a well-earned reputation for writing succinct, witty, hard-hitting articles for Vanity Fair, as well as other prestigious and literate magazines. He must not have found his voice yet in 1990. The writing is entertaining only in patches and the book overall, other than being in chronological order, poorly formed.<br />The meat of the text is a series of anecdotes concerning relationships between Englishmen (rarely Englishwomen), Americans and English-Americans in the early days of the United States up to around the 1950's. The author has gone to some trouble to root out the most unsavory characters from both sides of the Atlantic. Based on this book, the \\"special relationship\\" between England and America was a series of behind-the-scenes deals between greedy, ignorant, self-serving politicians, businessmen and private individuals. Rudyard Kipling, an Englishman living in India who moved to the United States, is quoted most frequently. From this reading, he sounds both highly influential and a thoroughly loathsome racist. Since he gave the world the famous line \\"You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din\\", I'll reserve judgment on that. Although he certainly wouldn't be the first great artist who was a jerk in private life.<br />The \\"special relationship\\" between the United States and England has been a topic of heated debate recently in the United Kingdom because of the war in Iraq. The British Prime Minister has asserted that the relationship both required Britain to join America's alliance against Suddam Hussein and gave the British some influence over events. In that case, replied a goodly portion of the British electorate, let's be done with a relationship that costs so much and achieves so little. But according to Hitchens, it is the UK that is constantly pushing the US into ill-thought out wars.... It's hard not to be skeptical about that.<br />When it comes down to details, Hitchens' case that the \\"special relationship\\" is alive and well and only slowly dying, is based on the presence of a faux-British pub in California, a one-upmanship contest between two senators trying to outquote Kipling to each other, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's reported (but unconfirmed) comment to George Bush Sr that \\"this is no time to go wobbly\\" when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. <br />For a student of the \\"special relationship\\" between England and America, \\"Blood, Class and Empire\\" contains a good deal of historical source material that is not well-known. In that respect the book is genuinely of interest. But those of us looking for a modern, balanced and preferably entertaining report on the current situation between the two regions will have to look elsewhere. Most of the items here are as out of date as the word \\"Empire.\\"	2004-07-04

It is some hundreds of years old and stands lopsidedly in the middle of the picturesque old village of Hay-on-Wye on the border between England and Wales . The Wye valley winds green and lush along foot of the brown hills known - with Welsh poetic license - as the Black Mountains. It sounded like an ideal place for a young writer and his artist wife and toddler son to settle down. And it almost was.<br />Several years ago, Paul Collins was living in San Francisco with a first book ready for publication and a certainty that he and his family needed to move somewhere cheaper and safer. Hay, which he had visited before, sounded ideal. As it famously advertises, it has 40 bookstores serving its 1500 residents, and it considers itself the world's antiquarian book centre. The Hay Festival in early summer attracts visitors from every English-speaking country.<br />With more modesty than accuracy, Collins claims that he was offered a job sorting out the mounds of books in the American literature section of a rambling bookstore in Wye based purely on his American accent. But Collins obviously knows his books. He has filled \\"Sixpence House\\" with snippets from obscure volumes that are by turns bizarre and hilarious. He has also developed a Theory of Dust Jackets:<br />\\"There is an implicit code that customers rely on. If a book cover has raised lettering, metallic lettering, or raised metallic lettering, then it is telling the reader: `Hello. I am an easy-to-read work on espionage, romance, a celebrity, and/or murder.' To readers who do not care for such things, this lettering tells them: `Hello. I am crap.' Such books can use only glossy paper for the jacket; Serious Books can use glossy finish as well, but it is only Serious Books that are allowed to use matte finish.<br />Diminutively sized paperbacks, like serial romances or westerns or dieting or astrology guides, are aimed at the uneducated. But diminutively sized hardcover books are aimed at the educated - except those that are very diminutive, which are religious books aimed at the uneducated - and unless they are in a highly rectangular format, in which case they are point-of-purchase books aimed at the somewhat-but-not-entirely educated.....\\"<br />This book, by the way, has a \\"matte\\" cover in a \\"muted, tea-stained\\" colour. That means that it is Serious Literature. Oh, surely not that serious, Mr Collins.<br />The author's theory of house prices was less successful. Assuming that anywhere as far from paid employment as Hay was bound to be a cheap place to live, he went in search of a quaint old home with stone walls, massive beams and a huge garden for his son to play in. This would have been fair enough when Britain's economy really was \\"sad\\", but it has developed something of a smirk in recent years. All those affluent townies buying second homes for the weekend have sent house prices in rural England and Wales rocketing out of reach of young families in the countryside. The only houses that are \\"quaint\\", but still within the price range of an aspiring writer, come encumbered with entailed land or six inches of water in the basement. Successful writers, as Collins deserves to be based on this book, may find a wider choice.	2004-07-02

Note that if you want to do business with one of these entities, you will do better to head for London, Tokyo, Liechtenstein or New York than anywhere outside territorial waters. \\"Offshore\\" is a virtual space defined by its exemption from taxes, regulations and other annoying features of the nation-state.<br />Ronen Palan brings an outstanding depth of knowledge of his subject to this book. He traces the roots of the offshore system to the late 19th century, when the concept of sovereign states was developing in ways that often presented obstacles to international traders. The result today is a system of non-sovereign states that has grown in parallel to, and generally with the support of, nation-states. Most of that growth has occurred since the late 1960's, at the time of the profitability crisis and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system. Today an estimated $2 trillion per day passes through the offshore foreign exchange market and 20% of total private wealth is parked in tax havens. And those figures are growing.<br />Aside from the breath-taking sums that flow through a system outside tax or regulatory control, what are the political implications of offshore? Palen's thesis is that nation-states have lost control of the monetary system: The offshore tail is wagging the sovereign-state dog. Wealthy individuals and multinational corporations can simply pick up their financial assets and take them offshore if nation-states don't lower taxes and regulatory requirements to their dictates. And without sufficient funds democratic states are in no position to provide either their populations or offshore facilities with the services and security they expect. The paradox is that offshore has been an inevitable outgrowth of the division of the world into sovereign states. <br />Professor Palan sees the growth of offshore accelerating. Sooner, rather than later, its dark matter will dramatically impact our visible world in ways we cannot yet foresee. \\"Offshore can end only when either the state system has ended its long half-millennial journey or capitalism itself has been replaced by another system.\\"	2004-06-15

A struggling poet, defeated one stormy night by British Railway's unfathomable time-tables, takes shelter in an old toyshop, only to stumble upon the body of a woman inside. But when he returns there with the police, the toyshop has gone and in its place is a grocery shop. It sounds like a story from Ray Bradbury, but this mystery is caused by very common human greed.  <br />Edmund Crispin was the pen-name of composer Bruce Montgomery. British movie fans will recognize his name as the creator of the music for the Carry On comedy series. Crispin is one of the mystery writers from the Golden Age of mystery fiction between the wars whose works have stood the test of time. It's a pity that so many of them are currently out of print. <br />Where American writers specialized in hard-boiled detectives, like Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe and Dashiel Hammett's Sam Spade, the British fiction of the period preferred its heroes to be languid, educated and world-weary. It goes without saying that they spoke several languages, including French and Latin, were familiar with classical music and literature, and hedonistically fond of cigarettes, whisky and good port. <br />The Moving Toyshop has remained a favourite of classical mystery fiction fans, because it incorporates all of the best features of its genre. The amateur detective is Gervase Fen, a disarmingly eccentric professor of English Language and Literature at Oxford University. The narrator in this story is a querulous, but biddable poet, a cross between Conan Doyle's Dr Watson and Douglas Adams' Arthur Dent. The conversations concern bad literature and Oxford dons, and usually take place in a comfortable Oxford pub. And the villains escape on bicycles.	2004-06-13

Going Nucular is a collection of 65 articles, each one based on a word that is commonly used in political speech. It's an eclectic list: terrorism, vision, freedom, régime, hero, torture, capitalism, postmodern, fascist, google. Then, of course, there's nuclear.<br />I had a momentary fear on receiving this book that it would be yet another diatribe against (or for) the current president, who is well-known for his tendency to mispronounce nuclear as \\"nucular.\\" But the author reminds us that this word has tripped up a series of presidents from Dwight D Eisenhower to Jimmy Carter to Bill Clinton. Nunberg's point, as usual, is more subtle. He notes that some of the people who talk of \\"nucular weapons\\" have no difficulty pronouncing \\"nuclear family.\\" So are they really stubbing their toes on a hard-to-say word or are they indulging in faux-folksy speech?     <br />Warning to grammarians: Nunberg has no patience with the dictionary police. In his opinion, English is at its best in creative hands - just think of Shakespeare. How we use and change words gives those with the ear to hear a wealth of information about how we think.

Explorers urgently needed better maps and navigational systems. Scientists were competing to accurately determine the shape of the Earth. Add in a little political intrigue and you have the subject of The Mapmaker's Wife: a 1735 French mapmaking expedition to Peru that lasted a decade.    <br />The European Enlightenment was an extraordinary time for all intellectuals. France was the center of scientific research: Spain concentrated on exploring - and occupying - the new world. When French scientists suggested a journey to the Andes to measure the lines of latitude and longitude there and settle the question of the shape of the Earth, King Louis XV saw a chance to get information on the closely guarded Spanish empire.<br />Robert Whitaker has won acclaim for his scientific journalism and he brings all his skills to The Mapmaker's Wife. The real story of 18th century mapmaking is more exciting than any fiction and the characters involved are full of life. As part of his research for the book, the author traveled to South America. Although he doesn't mention his own travels in the book, the detailed descriptions of what travelers encountered could only have been written by someone who knew the region.<br />The mapmaker's wife only appears towards the end of the book. Isobel Godin was a Peruvian who had married one of the younger members of the mapmaking expedition. After waiting twenty years for him to return, she set out east across the Amazon jungle to find him. Her journey became one of the great survivor stories of the century and nicely complements the experiences of the French mapmakers in their journey west.	2004-06-11

If nobody is following you, then no matter how inspiring or impressive you may think you are, you are not a leader. To lead is to persuade others to follow: That is the essence of leadership.<br />\\"Leading IT: The Toughest Job in the World\\" is what you get when you take the best book on leadership available; remove the repetition, padding, footnotes, appendices and inspirational fluff; but leave the intelligence in place. The result is 115 pages containing the essence of leadership, boiled down to the core.<br />Here is a typical example from a sidebar headed \\"Leadership is easiest in a crisis\\":<br />\\"...Leading an organization is much, much harder when there's no emergency. Consider Franklin Delano Roosevelt: His greatness resulted less from his resolve following the attack on Pearl Harbor than from his response to the Great Depression. By putting people back to work and through his weekly radio broadcasts he gave people hope. Arguably, it was by restoring America's belief in its ability to solve its problems that he could lead the country through World War II....\\"<br />How's that for a timely reminder?	2004-06-07

The narrative is related by an old woman who is what was once called \\"simple-minded.\\" Passed around as a child amongst adults who alternately love, use, tolerate and scorn her, she struggles to make sense of events in terms she can understand. Painfully aware of her \\"differentness\\", she learns to ride the hard times patiently and fight back only when pushed beyond endurance.<br />Azzopardi has cleverly allowed the thoughts of her protagonist, as expressed in the story, to be articulate and perceptive, although the character struggles to express herself out loud to others. The result is a sustained level of tension with poetic imagery that never becomes overwrought or maudlin.      <br />By the end of \\"Remember Me\\", Winnie has made her peace with the world, and neither wants nor needs our sympathy. Nevertheless, we should be ashamed that she was based on a real life \\"resident of the streets\\", one of those forced to squat in abandoned buildings in the middle of so much affluence.	2004-06-06

How is it that exactly the item we want is available in our local store, when we didn't know the farmer who grew the cotton, the dyer who dyed the thread, the tailor who sewed the pieces, nor the shipper who shipped the shirt? Nor did most of these people know each other. Of all the things that might puzzle a Neanderthal who wandered into our time zone, this would be one of the strangest.<br />In this wonderfully readable book, subtitled \\"A Natural History of Economic Life\\", Paul Seabright follows the story of what he calls the \\"shy, murderous ape\\" from lonely hunter to homo economicus, confidently mingling with crowds of strangers and daily dependant on numerous people whom he has never met. Amazingly, to our Neanderthal, we have learned to trust strangers.<BR>    <BR>The question asked in the second half of the book is how far we should rely on such leaderless chains. Some items, such as airline travel and hospital care, don't lend themselves to blind trust. And who is to stop the cotton farmer from polluting the river that the dyer downstream drinks from, or the dyer from polluting the air that the tailor breathes? At what point do the connections between countries or companies become impossibly fragile?<br />Finally Professor Seabright dismisses recent talk about globalization as \\"excitable\\" and dismisses it as a mere continuation of a trend of \\"at least the last ten thousand years.\\" That does imply that, as far as economics is concerned, camels and the Silk Road are no different from container ships and the internet highway. This is one of several topics in the final chapters of the book which are only touched upon and which would repay our closer attention. Perhaps we can hope that The Company of Strangers is only the first volume in a story to be continued.<BR>   <BR>Kudos also to Leslie Flis, Tim Flach and Augustin de Berranger for the stunning dust jacket. They too were part of the chain in the production of this highly entertaining and  likable book.	2004-06-01

This Boston-based murder mystery is illustrated throughout by reproductions of his art work, including those persistent ants on their twisted band of paper. <br />Like Escher's parade of ants on the Möbius strip, the characters march around and around and end up back where they started. Like Escher's \\"Birds and Fish\\", The plot has repeating patterns that change subtly over time until they turn into something quite different. The images in Escher's \\"Reflecting Sphere\\" become Doppelgänger. (How many women in green coats? How many shy Leonards?) Most dramatically, there are the stark contrasts of dark and light: Here is love and hate; joy and tragedy; kindness and malevolence.     <br />The husband and wife detective pair of Homer and Mary Kelly struggle to relate the people in torn pieces of family photographs. Which is up and which down? Who is parent and who child?  And just as the puzzle pieces begin to fit, the pattern breaks up again like a surreal dream.  By the way, just in case you rushed to read the book without checking its cover, count carefully how many pillars there are in the pagoda.	2004-05-29

One would expect no less from a master news editor like Rene Chappon. The formula Cappon follows is to write a very brief explanation of a problem; an example of the problem; a sentence dissecting the example; a rewriting of the problem sentence; and a summary of the topic. The result is almost always memorable. Consider this typical section on The Elegant Variation (capitalized words below are italicized in the original):<br />***<BR>Writers who believe that the repetition of plain words within shouting distance of each other is crude take off on synonym safaris.... It's all the more grotesque as there are few true synonyms and the author may introduce misfits:<br />\\"The mayor's task force was asked to meet with the owners of the STRUCTURES, discuss whether they wanted their BUILDINGS preserved, and recommend ways to adapt older EDIFICES to new use.\\"<br />STRUCTURES could be anything and EDIFICES is too grandiose; the story concerns commercial and apartment buildings. If the author didn't want to repeat BUILDINGS, a pronoun was the way out:<br />\\"...to meet with the owners of the buildings, discuss whether they wanted THEM preserved, and recommend ways to adapt the older ones to new uses.\\"<br />The same craving for daintiness will convert elephants to PACHYDERMS, dogs to CANINES, cats to FELINES, tigers to STRIPED PREDATORS and cars to VEHICLES. Petroleum becomes BLACK GOLD, snow becomes WHITE POWDER (a justly forgotten poet once called it \\"God's dandruff\\"), a banana turns into THE ELONGATED YELLOW FRUIT.<BR>***<br />The benefit of this style is that Cappon's admonitions pop up unasked whenever we commit one of the sins he identifies.

In \\"Status Anxiety\\" he looks for the source of modern angst-not to mention obsession-about our social rank. In particular, he examines the stories we tell ourselves to explain the righteousness of our situation and how those stories affect our happiness. <br />De Botton looks back at a time long ago when peasants led a far harsher existence in material terms, but rarely worried that their difficulties were \\"their own fault.\\" Thus had God made the world, and such were the affairs of men supposed to be. When we could not improve our social rank or material worth, there was no tendency to confuse riches with saintliness.<br />Starting from that idealized Rousseau-esque time, the author follows changing ideas about personal rights and responsibilities and finds a distinct downside to the whole concept of Western meritocracy. If we can be anything we want to be, our current relative lack of wealth, power, beauty and fame must be our own fault. No longer able to blame God, bad luck or the stars for misfortune, we see the world split into winners (virtuous, hard-working and strong) and losers (evil, lazy and weak). Where we once understood the complexity and frailty of human existence, we now see the world in terms of newspaper headlines:  \\"Oedipus the King: Royal in Incest Shocker.\\"<br />Finally, \\"Status Anxiety\\" looks at some of the ways that modern humans have tried to escape this social trap. It considers both bohemian and Christian philosophies and finds merits in both, if notably fewer in bohemianism. Ultimately, the book concludes, if our current set of values offers true happiness and contentment to only an elite minority, the democratic solution is to change those values. De Botton's contribution to that end is this book.	2004-05-25
US	36885193	R398XTGLJPHWN2	0066209250	530766530	A Mighty Fortress: A New History of the German People	Books	5	85	92	N	N	Two millennia of German history	\\"A Mighty Fortress\\" undertakes to narrate the history of Germany as a cohesive story, beginning at the beginning and ending today. It is a mammoth task, covering over two millennia from the days of the Roman Empire: That is ten times as long as the United States of America has been in existence. The result is a massive amount of information packed into one book, but it does give an intelligence to events, which is missing when we randomly examine short periods of historical time with the benefit, and distortion, of our knowledge of the future.<br />Fortunately, the book spends more time on some periods of history than others. We are taken at a fast clip up to the Middle Ages and through some less pivotal times. But the author slows the pace and looks in fine detail at such critical persona as Martin Luther and Otto von Bismarck, both complex and contradictory figures. Placed in historical context, much of what seems short-sighted or self-defeating today becomes understandable when approached forwards from the past, rather than backwards from the future. In this way, familiar names develop the immediacy and vivacity that they must have had to their contemporaries: Dürer, Kant, Goethe, Hegel, Beethoven, Marx, Nietzsche, Grass.    <br />The book contains eight pages of photographs and six maps. That is really not enough to follow the constantly changing borders of Europe and I found it helpful to keep a historical atlas handy. Less easily resolved was the author's practice of Americanizing names. This may have been a conscious choice to isolate us from pre-existing judgments about historical characters, but it would have been more forgiving to map in a footnote, for example, Ludwig von Yorck to Generalleutnant Hans David Ludwig Graf Yorck von Wartenburg. In addition, converting every Heinrich and Henri to Henry (or Frederick or William) made it hard to separate the players, given the lack of imagination of the European aristocracy in naming their offspring. These are,however, all very minor items.<br />Judging from the reception \\"A Mighty Fortress\\" has received in Germany, Professor Ozment has correctly identified the frustration of modern Germans in being identified only through the dreadful years of the Third Reich. Ozment may be more willing than most to sound the all-clear on Germany's potential for belligerence, but he has served the interests of all of us in placing Germany in factual historical context.	2004-05-25

That was before several recent high-profile fiascos in the US, UK and Australia, where badly-run call centers destroyed in a few months the customer goodwill that had been expensively built up over years.<br />It doesn't have to be that way. David Butler shows how call centers can be a bottom-line asset to companies, not just a money sink. It cites, for example, the case of a highly cost-effective center in the south-west United States with an annual employee turnover of under 3% and (if I guess the real identity of the company correctly) many happy repeat customers, including myself.<br />David Butler owns a call center management company and is a recognized expert on the subject. \\"Bottom-Line Call Center Management\\" contains detailed information on where best to locate new call centers, how to evaluate and implement new call center technology, how to calculate the value of a call center in dollar terms, and how to create an environment that will attract and retain a loyal and productive staff.  <br />For those of us on the customer side of the business, Dr Butler stresses the need to ensure that representatives are familiar with the products they support or sell. Call center representatives, just like all customer-facing staff, need to understand how customers use the company products and services.  If representatives can't articulate product knowledge and understand customer concerns, they really are just a \\"cost center\\" and, as the author repeatedly warns, are in danger of having their jobs eliminated or sent abroad. That represents a disaster to their communities and a financial loss to the companies that employed them.	2004-05-20

There is general agreement in the United States that the last few decades have been much more profitable for the wealthiest few percent of the population than for everyone else. \\"More Equal Than Others\\" makes the point that even this understanding of inequality is greatly underestimated by most Americans. Godfrey Hodgson, who is a long time Washington correspondent for the British media and who wrote this book for The Century Foundation in New York, believes that the US media have consistently presented a picture of the country that makes it appear more economically successful and more egalitarian compared to other countries than is in fact the case. He claims that recent statistics show that the US is, by some measures, the least egalitarian of the eleven most industrialized countries.<br />Hodgson bases his case on a review of history from the 1970's through the first couple of years of this century. Much of what he presents will be entirely familiar to anyone who has lived in the US during that time. Indeed, the book has a tendency to present history by anecdote, rather than analysis. Nevertheless, it contains nuggets of information which should interest any close social or political observer of the country. Where he doesn't persuade, he certainly proves himself to be a worthy debating partner. Above all, he makes us think.<br />Godfrey Hodgson's political concern is made transparent by both the book's title and its dust jacket, which shows two photographs: One is of a man in a suit looking at the skyline from a penthouse office; the other is of a group of people seated around a table under a freeway overpass. That neither photograph needed to be staged is unarguable. By chance, I am writing this review looking out from just such a luxury high-rise overlooking an empty lot where three men are asleep on the ground. They must remember better days, because they have lined up their pieces of cardboard against a wall like beds in a dormitory. Only feet away is one ofthe busiest freeways in the United States.   <br />The question is whether Hodgson's book will play only to the liberal choir, or whether he has introduced enough new facts, or presented existing facts in a sufficiently original manner, to persuade any of those freeway drivers to stop. <br />\\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others. - George Orwell, Animal Farm\\"	2004-05-16

The descriptions of the establishments that I am familiar with were right on the money. They are grouped by neighborhood and have basic information, such as opening hours. I was disappointed that Indonesian restaurants were short-changed, because they \\"aren't authentically Asian.\\" True, but an Indonesian rijstafel shared between half a dozen or more people is not too expensive and is an authentically Dutch form of entertainment. The biggest problem with the book is that it doesn't open flat. You need both hands to force it open wide enough to read comfortably and then it's hard to flip through the pages. And you will do a lot of flipping, because there's no good index to help you find things. <br />There are about half a dozen pages of photographs of the Amsterdam area, unnaturally sunny and uncrowded. Amsterdam is one of Europe's most interesting and picturesque cities, but nobody goes there for the weather, and the crowds of pedestrians and bicycles are part of the charm. The description of Dutch culture was spot on. Amsterdammers in particular are very broad-minded-one of the reasons that Amsterdam is a favorite vacation spot for gays and lesbians--but they're not part of the have-a-nice-day crowd. Expect them to be polite and helpful, rather than effusive.    <br />I have half a dozen guides to Amsterdam and find that no one of them covers all aspects of a visit. \\"Lonely Planet Amsterdam\\" is most useful as a way of finding somewhere quick to eat when you're out sight-seeing.	2004-05-15

Ian Caldwell and Dustin Thomason have set their debut novel on the campus of Princeton University and populated it with academics, scholars and students. <br />Four undergraduate room-mates are drawn into the obsession of one of them, understanding the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, a book published in 1499, part illustrated encyclopaedia, part erotic novel. Scholars have been trying to unravel the secrets hidden in the pages of this strange book for 500 years. As it finally starts to yield its encrypted message, the fight to become the first to publish turns murderous.<br />The authors rely on a large cast of mostly classical and Renaissance players for quotations and ideas: St Augustine, Browning, Dante, Descartes, Galen, Goethe, Michelangelo, Ovid, Al-Nafis, Milton, St Paul, Pliny, Savonarola. Even Schrödinger and Stoppard drop by. This is very much a book for readers. <br />For anyone who wants to dig deeper, a copy of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili is available free on the web courtesy of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or in English translation from Amazon. The real book may not contain a steganographic treasure map, but the authors make the idea credible.<br />According to the dust jacket, Ian Caldwell and Dustin Thomason have been friends since childhood and they have been collaborating on this book for six years. In that time, they have cleansed the story of every awkwardness, hyperbole or inconsistency. The result is good, plain English and a satisfying story that finishes with a bang.	2004-05-11

Who cares about you?	\\"City of Truth\\" is really two short stories, three if you count the brief final section. Each section is almost worth its own review, because they are so different.<br />City I is a description of a society where people have perfect honesty literally burned into their brains. It's incredibly funny because it contrasts so completely with our own feel-good consumer society. Politicians candidly admit that they accepted kick-backs; a salesperson tells you where to buy an item more cheaply from a competitor; restaurants sell \\"murdered cow\\" sandwiches with \\"wilted lettuce.\\" <br />The odd thing is that the city is rather a flat, cold place. Parents critique their kids' drawings (\\"It's pretty ugly.\\") and romance is replaced by the brutal, hurtful truth. After a while, you long for someone to say \\"Have a nice day!\\" with a big smile, instead of truthfully expressing their complete indifference. <br />City II describes a rebel group which teaches people to lie again. The treatment involves exposing disciples to genetically-engineered impossibilities: pigs that fly, dogs that talk. Why this is supposed to help isn't entirely clear, but it enables a father to tell \\"kind lies\\" to his terminally sick child. The problem is that the boy can see that his father is lying: This is one case where honesty would be the best policy. City II is a real tear-jerker.<br />City III has the family leaving both the Truth Tellers and the Liars and settling for the kind of messy mix that we have: trying to tell the truth as far as possible, but making space for poetic license and white lies. That's fair enough, but there are no revelations here. Most of us feel this way already. <br />Consider the five stars all for the first section and well worth them.	2004-05-09

Mr T, Smiley then discovered, had trained at Longchamp in France and had won races all over the United States. From here there was no going back. <br />Thanks in part to Mr T, Smiley now owns a string of Thoroughbred race-horses and dreams, but only dreams, of leaving her writer's days behind her and becoming a full-time horse-trainer. In the meantime, she has compromised by writing \\"A Year at the Races\\", an account of her experiences as a racing-stable owner. <br />Each chapter reads like a letter to a friend and the entire book covers an amazing amount of ground. The author looks at the special role of horses in human society: Horses, according to Smiley are more intelligent than dogs and more like humans in their wide-ranging abilities. She considers the personality types of horses, compares them to human types, and considers how we both react to our environment, challenges and communities. <br />The book also takes a long, hard look at what horses have to do earn their living. Horses, unlike other \\"pets\\", are too expensive to be indulged as only companions: They must race, jump, show or carry. Mini-horses are even earning a place as guides for the blind. A horse that fails to socialize properly and learn to earn a living has a poor future. That gives owners and trainers a particular responsibility to help the horse succeed at its job and remain healthy and strong.<BR> <BR>Where I am sure the book will draw criticism is in Smiley's use of \\"horse communicators,\\" who claim to be able to \\"talk\\" to horses. It sounds silly and it's only when the author disarmingly admits that such activities are probably \\"rubbish\\", but nevertheless wildly entertaining, that you realize that it is not Smiley who is the fool. She is an intelligent and open-minded individual, who can explore possibilities that are beyond the imagination of most of us. That is what made her a Pulitzer prize-winner and that is what makes \\"A Year at the Races\\" a great read, even for those who don't consider themselves \\"horsy.\\"	2004-05-09

One woman excoriated her lover in a note left under the windshield wipers of a car parked outside a rival girlfriend's house that she thought belonged to him. She finished her letter with a postscript that read: Please call me. What was she thinking of? <br />It's amazing how many people curse out inconsiderate neighbors or car-parkers a blue streak and then politely end their message with \\"Thanks.\\" The entertainment in the book is mostly in the incongruity of the messages. On the other hand, after a few pages the humor fades. Either the notes aren't especially amusing or they're obviously deliberate attempts at humor. At least, I hope the person asking for information on a lost cobra \\"answering to Psycho\\" was making a joke.<br />A couple of items are an odd choice for a mostly funny book.

When someone else commits the evil deed first, Strangeways is called in to sort out the resulting mess.<br />Taken on one level, The Beast Must Die is an entertaining, if rather over-written, crime thriller. At another level, it's a much more entertaining spoof of the kind of mannered stories about the British middle class between the wars that were popular at the time.  The book's opening sentence has become a classic: &quot;I am going to kill a man... I have no idea what he looks like. But I am going to find him and kill him.&quot;<br />The title is taken from the Book of Ecclesiastes: The beast must die, the man dieth also, yea both must die.	2004-04-29

(Modern Library Classics)	Books	5	10	18	N	N	Edwardian crime stories as recommended by Harlan Ellison	This book of short stories with a foreword by the great science fiction writer, Harlan Ellison, is centered on one story, The Problem of Cell 13, which was first published in The Boston American in 1906.<br />Harlan Ellison's twelve-page introduction is entirely honest about the merits of the book. He first met the The Thinking Machine, Futrelle's brainy protagonist, when he read The Problem of Cell 13 as a boy and fell in love with this beautifully-crafted little puzzle story. Futrelle's other stories are distinctly ho-hum and Futrelle himself lost his life when the Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg in 1912.<br />The ONLY reason for reading this book is to explore crime fiction as it existed in the Edwardian era. But that's a very good reason and you have Harlan Ellison's word for it.	2004-04-27

Part I narrates the love affair between a clever young man of good family and an uneducated woman twenty years his senior. Somerset Maugham explores the same topic in \\"Of Human Bondage\\", as does J W Goethe in \\"Die Leiden des jungen Werther.\\" Schlink adds his own twist by making Michael only 15-years-old at the start of the affair, two years younger than he tells 36-year-old Hanna and several years younger than he behaves.<br />Michael's youth emphasizes his innocence in the affair, his seduction by an older woman, and allows a light-hearted, romantic introduction: Michael and Hanna bicycling through the German countryside; Michael and Hanna making tender love; Michael reading the classics to an enthralled Hanna.<br />Fast-forward seven years to Part II, when law-student Michael attends a Nazi war crime trial as part of his studies. There is Hanna again: Hannah as a former prison guard at the concentration camp in Krakow; Hanna making the prisoners read classics to her before \\"selecting\\" them for extermination at Auschwitz; Hanna letting prisoners burn to death in a locked church, because \\"otherwise they might have escaped.\\"<br />Schlink lets the action slow as Michael holds a prolonged conversation with himself about the morality of the situation. Should he tell the judges of Hanna's lack of education, not to mention apparent complete lack of human intelligence, as a mitigating factor to lessen her sentence? Was he right to condemn all members of that generation equally, even those who were not actively supportive of the Nazi regime, such as his father? <br />The final section of the trilogy provides a satisfying solution to the paradox, at least as far as Michael is concerned: Hanna nobly enduring her punishment; Hanna painfully teaching herself to read; Hanna educating herself about the role of women as prisoners and guards; Hanna saving her meager pay as \\"restitution.\\" Finally, and most necessary for justice, there is Hanna hanging herself so that she does not become a burden on Michael. <br />Bernhard Schlink has written extensively on the subject of justice and the third Reich. \\"Der Vorleser\\" assumes knowledge of those times, as well as of the conflict between the Nazi and post-Nazi generations in Germany. His unadorned German prose leaves it to the reader to distinguish truth from irony.	2004-04-18

I first read the book when it was published in German in 1993 and it's the only one of the series that I regularly enjoy re-reading. There's nothing slick about the story telling: it has a very raw edge to it.<br />The story follows the traditional Wallendar plotline: an exotic foreigner arrives in the peaceful coastal town of Ystad, accompanied by a slew of violent acts and connections to powerful people that shock the overworked local police force. In this case, the foreign dogs who wash up on Sweden's shore are two very dead businessmen with drugs in their systems.<br />Wallendar follows the trail back across the Baltic Sea to Riga, the capital of newly independent Latvia. There he involves himself more in local \\"affairs\\" than is politic or safe. Mankell kicked up some dust with this book. The Latvia described is a chaotic mix of gangland crime and corrupt officialdom. Some Latvians took exception to that bleak picture. (Latvia became independent in 1991 and \\"Hundarna i Riga\\" was published the following year.)<br />Kommissar Wallendar is often compared to Georges Simenon's Inspecteur Maigret or Colin Dexter's Chief Inspector Morse. In this book, he also shows traces of John Le Carré's Smiley. Mankell has been extremely popular in Europe for a long time. Maybe his books are better read in a cold, damp climate like that of Sweden, but I can't see anything that makes them \\"difficult for some American readers\\" as Publishers Weekly advises.	2004-04-13

The much-honored Harvard professor claims that the gap between common wisdom about national economics and reality has widened alarmingly in recent years.<br />The center of the book's thesis is that what we once called \\"capitalism\\", and now usually call a \\"Market System\\", has morphed into a \\"Corporate System\\" controlled by management bureaucracy. Here are two short fragments to give the flavor of Galbraith's tract:<br />Myth: Shareholders own corporations.<BR>\\"No one should be in any doubt: Shareholders-owners-and their alleged directors in any sizable enterprise are fully subordinate to the management. Though the impression of owner authority is offered, it does not, in fact, exist.\\"<br />Myth: The public sector is entirely independent of the private sector.<BR>\\"At this writing, corporate managers are in close alliance with the President, the Vice President and the Secretary of Defense. Major corporate figures are also in senior positions elsewhere in the federal government; one came from the bankrupt and thieving Enron to preside over the Army.\\"<br />In earlier times, this book would have been burned in the public square.

The author calls this approach Human-tech.<br />Consider that one of the reasons that hospitals continue to kill patients, even after badly designed equipment is identified, is that medical personnel dare not openly admit error, because of the severe career and legal consequences. This type of problem goes beyond traditional technical design issues of usability or ergonomics.   <br />Ultimately, Dr Vicente is optimistic that we can and will resolve these problems. He offers the commercial airline industry as an example. In 2001, despite the horrendous murders on September 11th, the total number of major airline crashes was fewer than in any year since World War II. What the aviation industry did for commercial flights, we can do for our healthcare system, airport security, or anything we want to turn our hand to.	2004-04-08

Each piece concentrates on a different aspect of the writer's trade, from giving a lyric poem that final polish, to understanding rejection letters, to negotiating a book contract.  <br />That there are thirty-one contributions is in itself a measure of the complexity of the writer's world. In addition to editors, writers must deal with agents and publicists, booksellers and  literary organizations. There are readings to give, flyers to print, contracts to negotiate, and book tours to arrange. For people used to solitary work, that can be overwhelming. <br />Writers, as several of the contributors point out, are sometimes out of the loop as far as the `business' of publishing is concerned. Even though the industry revolves around them, the writers themselves may be unaware of what drives companies to accept one piece of work and reject another, or promote one book to best seller status while letting another languish on a back shelf.  <br />Therese Eiben and Mary Gannon of Poets&amp; Writers magazine have brought together a wonderfully knowledgeable and supportive group of people. \\"The Practical Writer\\" is full of solid, substantive advice.

There have been some interesting new insights in the field during the past few years, and the story is well worth retelling. Indeed, what makes humans so different from other animals is that we would consider telling \\"our story\\" at all.<br />The core of the book is the chain of events that could have created our modern minds from those of our ancestor apes. It stresses the concept of humans getting an evolutionary \\"free ride\\" from fortuitous changes. For example, the author offers the controversial suggestion that the increased cortical connections that eventually enabled our higher thinking abilities originally benefited pre-humans by helping them coordinate the complicated body movements used in hunting herd animals. Those with more neural connections had a better chance of bringing home lunch. Intelligent thought was simply a happy later by-product.<br />Anthropologists usually look backwards, but this History takes a quick peek at the future. Modern minds are far more than the hardware of cortex and neurons. Human infants start busily \\"softwiring\\" language and other skills into their brains as soon as they are born. William Calvin considers this new stage of evolution - one that we actually have some control over - and comes up with some surprising, and disturbing, predictions for our postmodern future.	2004-03-25

It avoids the metaphysical and mystical (what Edelman calls \\"spooky forces\\") and clearly explains any technical terms used. A glossary at the back of the book defines words from Action potential to Zombie. (\\"A hypothetical humanlike creature that lacks consciousness but which, it is erroneously assumed, can carry out all of the functions of a conscious human.\\")    <br />The author uses the concept of neural Darwinism to suggest how consciousness evolved in mammals by massively increasing the connectivity between the cortical areas of the brain that carry out perceptual categorization and the frontal areas responsible for value-category memory systems. The definition of zombies turns out not to be purely whimsical. Consciousness requires specific neural activity - and where that activity occurs there must be consciousness.<br />Dr Edelman promises a \\"deeper insight into issues that are the center of human concern\\" to any reader willing to make a concerted effort to understand this challenging subject. He delivers wonderfully well on his promise. The conscious brain as described in \\"Wider than the Sky\\" is complex, dynamic, variable and unique to humankind.	2004-03-21

The premise of \\"The Naked Crowd\\" is that we have become addicted to expensive feel-good gadgetry to protect us from terrorism, but that this gadgetry neither serves the needs of those who want more security nor those who want more privacy.<br />Rosen finds plenty of examples to bolster his case: the face-recognition systems that can't tell men from women, and suspect databases that force customs officials to pull 5-year old children and 85-year old seniors out of line, and have turned travel into a Kafkaesque nightmare for some unfortunately named individuals.<br />The more interesting question that the book addresses is why we are drawn to these worthless schemes. Rosen gives the unexpected results of an airport scanner test as the provocation for writing the book. People offered a choice of going through two airport scanners, which were identical in every way - except that only one had the image of the travellers' naked bodies obfuscated from the guards' screen - often chose the \\"Naked Machine\\" in preference to the other. The reason they offered was that they were using their voluntary humiliation as proof of their trustworthiness.  <br />Rosen suggests that this need to \\"expose\\" ourselves has been caused by our moving from small communities, where we knew everyone, to a hyperspace of constantly changing crowds of strangers. We each develop a mental thumbnail sketch of ourselves that we feel obliged to \\"market\\" via weblogs, bulletin boards - and user reviewer bio's. It forces us to  concentrate on revealing ourselves, rather than trying to retain whatever privacy we could in townships where everyone knew everyone else's business.<br />It would have been helpful if Rosen had offered a working definition of \\"privacy\\" or an explanation of why we should \\"protect\\" it. He pokes good fun at the British, who have mounted video cameras on every available vertical surface in the country in response to three decades of terrorist bombings. He uses this as the prime example ofan invasive, but useless, defense system. The cameras haven't resulted in the arrest of a single terrorist: they have simply  become a very expensive way of nabbing the occasional car thief. <br />However, the British don't find the cameras particularly intrusive. They, on their part, are dumbfounded at Americans' willingness to allow employers to read private emails, which they find far more intrusive than a web cam in the parking lot. Whose definition of privacy is \\"right\\"? If we can't define \\"privacy\\", how can we \\"protect\\" it?    <br />As much as has been written on security and privacy recently, I found a great deal new to think about in \\"The Naked Crowd\\". It raises issues which are more complicated than simply choosing the level of \\"privacy\\" we are prepared to give up for more \\"security.\\"	2004-03-20

He was afraid it was going to be a boring assignment. Not a bit of it.<br />Hoping to get an in-depth understanding of the source of the problem, he asked to be sent to the worst department, a back-office Securities Centre where people complained non-stop. They complained about the bureaucracy, the procedures, the head office, the branches, the IT department, the staff shortages, the computer system, the pay, the bonuses, and the furniture. They complained about the way people always complained. They rolled their eyes at the union representative and at the \\"Rah Rah\\" videos sent from head office.<br />They sat gloomily while management explained why that quarter's huge profit was actually bad news that would mean that the hiring freeze would continue, if it didn't actually lead to layoffs. The bank's officers couldn't understand why the staff were always so negative.<br />The employees seemed to have taken a shine to the amiable young American and freely confided their opinions about everybody and everything. In fact, they seem to have been a rather jolly group. They understood exactly how far they could go and what the rules and rituals of complaint were. They managed to complain ceaselessly, while ensuring that nobody ever felt complained about. They were kind and self-deprecating and often quite content with their jobs.<br />In \\"Unpopular Culture\\", John Weeks examines the role of culture in an organization: how local cultures (such as that at the Securities Centre) relate to corporate culture. In particular, he observes how deliberate attempts to change the culture usually fail, while actual changes to the environment can have a profound effect.       <br />Despite the slightly frivolous art work on the cover of the book, this is a thoughtful ethnography.

Now three professors of economics have used money from the Russell Sage Foundation to examine the record to see what actually happened to American firms during those stressful years. They wanted to know whether public perceptions matched reality.<br />The limited funds placed significant constraints on the resources available to the researchers. The value of their work depends heavily on their skill and judgement in using publicly available statistics and discrete private data bases to reveal more than at first sight evident. The result is a model of econometric technique. <br />The first conclusion is that newspaper media tended to favor the dramatic figures from large, well-known manufacturers. Manufacturing in America has been in long-term decline since 1967 and manufacturers have steadily shed jobs. So far, perception matches reality. However, agriculture and manufacturing only provide employment for 15% of the population, so this segment is not a good proxy for the entire economy.<br />What happened in the Service Sector that employed the other 85% of the population? Unfortunately, we can only see gross trends, because the government doesn't collect steady, detailed statistics on this segment. The researchers were forced to use some indirect techniques to tease out meaning from what was available.<br />\\"Downsizing\\", it turns out, is corporate-speak for upsizing. Firms laid off one set of workers - disproportionately less-educated, older, female or parents of young children - and hired on another set, by implication younger, male and single. Was the resulting workforce more productive? No, there was no change in employee productivity. Moreover, non-managerial employees bore the brunt of the layoffs, so that claims to be ridding the company of \\"fat\\" actually increased the management-to-staff ratio.<br />Did investors reward companies for theiraction? Perception says that downsizing is followed by an increase in the stock price. The reality is that stock prices remain steady or decline after downsizing announcements. <br />So what were the benefits of downsizing? The authors come to a surprising, but authoritative conclusion. Downsizing announcements force down staff wages so that the firm retains more profit. Simple really, isn't it?<br />\\"Downsizing in America\\" contains numerous graphs, tables, and economic formulae. Professors Baumol, Blinder and Wolff have spent the Sage Foundation funds wisely to \\"foster the development and dissemination of knowledge about the economy's political, social, and economic problems.\\"	2004-02-22

In Business 2010 they are attempting to objectively determine what the business landscape will realistically look like through the end of this decade. <br />There's no blue sky sci-fi here: the predictions, whether you agree with them or not, are all hard-headed business. The authors claim 85% accuracy from their previous predictions and confidently expect the same in this book. As they say: <br />\\"...predicting technological capabilities over the next ten years is relatively straightforward. What is difficult is predicting which capabilities will be exploited and how...\\"<br />What makes the book so interesting and valuable is that the authors \\"show their working\\". Starting with a brief description of technological trends already in play, such as biomimetics, increased bandwidth, WiFi and artificial intelligence, they plot the network of interactions with social and economic trends to estimate the probable future. Business 2010 may be aimed at corporate leaders and entrepreneurs, but if Pearson and Lyons are close to correct, there won't be many people whose lives don't drastically change before the end of the decade.<br />We are already seeing the leading edge of some of the changes that the authors detail: the automation of most administrative and call-centre type jobs and the geographic dispersal of many knowledge workers, often to their homes. But Pearson and Lyons look further into the future and see the \\"de-skilling\\" of many professions, such as medicine, law and management. All these tasks can be done more cheaply and reliably by software. \\"Personal care\\" workers may thrive, but those of us who aren't in the tiny minority of highly sought-after creative geniuses, can expect a continuing and stressful cycle of redundancy and retraining.<br />Who are the institutional losers? The authors see a hollowing out of power, a movement towards purely local organizations on the one hand and global entities on the other. National governments will become increasingly irrelevant as bits flow across country borders. Corporations will also lose out to smaller \\"virtual companies\\" and \\"virtual co-operatives of workers\\", electronically created organizations with no geographically identifiable location that are quickly formed and eliminated as needed. Only mines and factories will change more slowly:<br />\\"...General Motors is more likely to survive another 20 years than Microsoft...\\"<br />Substantive debate about the future of the \\"jobs economy\\" in industrialized nations and about international governance has hardly started. Pearson and Lyons have made an excellent start towards a more thoughtful and less politicized dialog.	2004-02-15

The book contains a good selection of applications for Excel, Word and Access. All of them, fortunately, are on the book's web site, so you can download a sample program and just change it as needed.<br />InfoPath is completely new. It's part of the Professional Enterprise Edition and it's for \\"creating distributable forms\\". Bluttman's book contains screen shots of all the dialogs needed to design new forms, which makes it pretty straightforward to follow along. It looks as though this could be really useful in a group environment.<br />There's a lot of information in this book, but all the samples I tried worked fine and were useful applications.	2004-02-15

A Wall Street Journal financial reporter has returned to her roots as a trained anthropologist to look at the cultural implications behind Japan's continued failure to deal definitively with its insolvent banking system.<br />The core point that Gillian Tett returns to again and again is that Japan's problems started when its traditionally-run banks extended into global markets. There they operated without any of the checks and balances provided by either Japanese society or Western business methods. <br />American, European and Australian customers were only too happy to take advantage of Japanese banks that lent money without any attempt at risk analysis. They called the bankers \\"unseasoned\\" and \\"juvenile\\". The Japanese, on their part, saw the West as a Garden of Eden, ripe for the picking. It was sweet revenge after the humilation of World War II.<br />The important point is that these wealthy, powerful men with their sophisticated knowledge of derivatives and debentures, were hopelessly naïve about the differences between Japanese and Western social and business assumptions. Despite many of the Japanese having lived and (often very successfully) worked in Europe or the US, and some of the Americans having lived in Japan, neither side showed any insight into the social mentality of the other. Crucially, this caused them to misinterpret even such basic tools of their trade as the implications behind a simple insurance contract.<BR>   <BR>There aren't many heroes in this tale. The Japanese bankers and their Japanese customers were crudely vulgar. The Western \\"ex-patriots\\" in Japan were crassly bad-mannered. It's no surprise that the more the Japanese public learned about both groups, the more outraged they became. Frustratingly, even the ongoing churn of politicians and political parties in an attempt to get the system reformed, and a few nominal criminal charges of fraud against some of the Japanese participants has failed to significantly cut the Gordian knot created in the 1980's and 1990's.    <br />At the date of publication (and of this review), Japan is still an economic basket case, its banks loaded with an unstable mountain of debt. In the final chapter, Tett lets the major participants involved in the takeover of one of the biggest banks by a Kansas-based \\"vulture\\" fund have the last say. Unsurprisingly, they all disagree with each other.	2004-02-09

As much as he wants to help the US stop the smuggling of Chinese illegals into the US, the favors being done for one of the illegals in return for his testimony against a notorious snakehead leave a sour taste in Chen's mouth. It doesn't help that the wife of the illegal, whom the American inspector is supposed to escort back to the US, has inconveniently disappeared.<br />All this sets the stage for why a Shanghai chief inspector (even one with a degree in English and American literature) is investigating the probably gang-related disappearance of a Chinese lower-middle class woman with a blonde American tagging along (even a member of the US Marshals Service with a degree in sinology.) The situation gives Chen the opportunity to show the American (and us) the best of Chinese cuisine, music, literature and traditions, while exposing her to the everyday lives of the kind of people who populate a criminal investigator's world. Chinese cities are crowded and life in rural China is still harsh for most people. Qiu doesn't evade that reality, while he acknowledges the growing existence of an affluent, sophisticated middle class in cosmopolitan areas like Shanghai. <br />Be warned that the author uses his characters to discuss some hot political issues, such as the Chinese one-child per family policy and US immigration law. He takes care to allow both sides of every issue to be aired, but these are still topics that distress some readers. Qiu is not a `safe' writer. He probes and provokes and touches some tender spots.      <br />The spotlight, however, remains on Chief Inspector Chen Cao, a most extraordinary man. He's intelligent, educated, thoughtful and realistic. Working within a bureaucratic organization, dealing on a daily basis with the criminal, vulnerable and damaged, he uses his love of poetry and respect for Chinese tradition to maintainhis bonhomie and integrity in a conflicted society in confusing times. In many ways, he represents the best of modern China.	2004-02-01

But The Rise of the Creative Class has recently been reissued in paperback, is frequently quoted by ambitious politicians, and is still being touted by its author. Therefore, it matters that we re-examine its contents carefully.<br />Richard Floridas thesis is that there is a niche group of society, which over the past century has grown to become a separately identifiable class in its own right, distinguishable from the Working Class or the Service Sector Class or the almost-disappeared class of agricultural workers. This is different from saying that todays better-educated workers need less direct supervision, or that many jobs vary more in content from day to day than used to be the case.<BR>    <BR>The author struggles mightily to define the nearly one-third of the population that he calls creative as a valid class. He proposes definitions, backs up a couple of pages later, corrects his proposal, and starts off down another path. The result is more of an out loud conversation with himself than a clearly delineated model. There are no neat conclusions here.<br />The book uses both published sources and the authors own research to identify the characteristics of his new class: who they are and what motivates them. Sometimes the sources are of doubtful value. <br />One has to wonder why he would turn to his public policy students at prestigious Carnegie Mellon University to find out why highly-paid manufacturing jobs are no longer attractive to young blue-collar workers. A stroll through any of Pittsburghs poorer neighborhoods would surely have elicited a more sensible and substantive response than that such jobs were insufficiently creative. <br />Similarly, the book quotes an Information Week magazine survey of high-techworkers on what mattered to them. Florida reads the low rating of stock options as a motivator to mean that respondents valued creative work more than money. As one of those respondents, I can tell you that we were simply saying that the declining stock market had rendered all our options worthless. We were tired of being paid in funny money.<br />A core point in the books thesis is that creative workers deliberately move to diverse, open, tolerant regions and that creative companies follow them there  a reverse of the earlier pattern of workers going to where the jobs were. This is one of the many patterns Florida tries to pin down, but which squirm under his microscope. San Francisco follows the pattern, but pleasantly homogenous, middle-class Austin, TX is a high-tech Mecca, while funky, artistic, open, tolerant, diverse New Orleans lags. <br />Tolerant of whom, by whom? Florida points out that there is a negative correlation between non-whites and creative class companies. The best leading indicator is the presence of a gay community. But is it surprising or meaningful, that the most affluent areas of the country are frequently home to double-male-income, no-kids households? Surely, this datum isnt enough to define a new class?<br />Dr Florida assumes  as did  most of us  that 2002 represented the nadir of the US economy and that we were rapidly returning to a more normal job situation. In retrospect, we were all wrong, but what can one say about the Creative Class thesis with the benefit of hindsight? Lets quote, as the book does, Hewlett-Packard CEO, Carly Fiorina, the quintessential creative class leader of the time:<br />Keep your tax incentives and highway interchanges; we will go where the highly skilled people are.<br />Most recently, this same CEO has angrily declared her right to move those same jobs to a tax-shelter in funky, artistic . Bangalore. If a million jobs can be re-categorized overnight from Creative Class to commodity Service Sector, were they ever really part of a Creative Class at all?<br />** Dr Florida has created a web site that can legitimately be regarded as an informal addendum to the book: [...] .	2004-01-25

McGovern et al define what they call \\"agile architecture\\". <br />Traditional forms of architecture have been overly complex, expensive and inextensible. Agile methods hope to cure that problem by using minimalist forms of the standard tools described in the book. The authors warn that their primary audience is composed of experienced software developers and architects, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the book to newer entrants to the field. This makes a very good overview of modern IT architectural practices.<br />Various chapters contain thumbnail sketches of such techniques as: SOA, web services, UML, SEI/CMM, the Zachman Framework, MDA, and RUP. Most importantly, they examine the benefits and drawbacks of these techniques and how they can be modified to fit the \\"agile architecture\\" model. <br />On a minor note, the book is beautifully produced on high-quality paper, using a clear font and just enough diagrams to add meaning to the text. Considering how much information has been packed into one book, the clear layout really helps to make it usable both for reading from beginning to end, and also for referring to later.	2004-01-04

Bill Blunden lists all the horrendous coding techniques he's come across in commercial software, while offering detailed tips on debugging and optimizing code. The very useful code examples are written in C++, C or assembly language, mostly on an Intel platform.<br />The aim of the book is to help computer science and engineering students jump the chasm to corporate life by giving them the real-life vocabulary and practices that they can expect to meet over the first few years of their professional life. Much of what they will learn is to forget most of what they've been taught in college -- from terse variable names to an infatuation with recursive routines.<br />Amongst the challenges that Blunden expands upon are the realities of corporate and office politics. Here are all the gory details of the name-and-blame game, information hiding and \\"Sysyphean\\" tasks aimed at pressuring people to quit. <br />Ultimately, Blunden concludes, software engineering, as a career path, has become a \\"quaint anachronism\\" and programming is \\"strictly a short-term occupation&quot;.

He's even enjoying a bit of success in his senior years. <br />In these six short stories, Rumpole represents an accused murderer,  a police officer accused of conspiracy to murder, and  a newspaper accused of invasion of privacy. He even gets to spring one of the incorrigible Timson's in the cleverest Timson tale yet.<br />What makes the Rumpole series so popular is not just the shear likeability of its untidy and overweight Old Bailey hack, but his deep-seated understanding of the difference between justice and law, and his true affection for the poor and unempowered. <br />In this book, the author depicts such thoroughly modern characters as a child of the streets, a poor single mum, and a `redeemed' con. As Rumpole says when he encounters an injustice: Get up on your hind legs and make a fuss about it!<br />By the way, there was another English author who exposed the underside of English society in a series of popular tales. His name was Charles Dickens.<br />*** Also recommended for anyone who enjoys the Rumpole books of Sir John Mortimer, anything by Janwillem van de Wettering.	2003-12-07

Obviously, the American Programmer is in decline, so Ed Yourdan got that right. The question is whether the book has anything important to say to us today.<br />This is a book about case tools. Anybody remember them? Yourdan's argument was that the willingness of Indian programmers to use case tools would enable them to produce good, cheap software at a fraction of the cost of that generated by American 'cowboys'. His strong advice for programmers in the US was to start using mechanistic methods, so that they could also start churning out code like cookies in a cookie factory.<br />Most probably, Decline and Fall will remain an interesting book for students of computer science to read for many years into the future - not for what it got right, but for what it got wrong. Common wisdom today (which may become foolishness tomorrow) is that American Programmers can't hope to compete against people living in poor nations by trying to undercut them on cost, but only by using their native creativity and willingness to explore new frontiers to create truly new products. <br />In other words, Yourdan correctly forsaw the future, but badly misjudged the solution.	2003-11-02

The Art of Interactive Design was the sleeper of the year for me. I'm surprised it hasn't created more of a splash. Perhaps it's because it's published by a lesser known publisher and it doesn't fit the standard format of most usability or GUI books. It doesn't, for instance, include any code examples. It's purely about concepts and approaches.<br />What Chris Crawford does that is so effective is to approach design issues from such an oblique angle that I found myself looking at very familiar situations with new eyes. The text bursts with the outraged language of a frustrated user. Consider his description of the old documentation issue:<br />\\"I hold in special contempt those designers who dismiss users' fears with RTFM (Read The Manual); I'd love to lock them in a dark room at four in the morning with a 400-page manual explaining how to turn on the lights.\\"<br />That kind of robust language, and some very useful technical information from his experience as a games programmer, makes this book an easy five star recommendation.	2003-07-31

But it does cover syntax, flow control, classes and methods, inheritance, exception handling, file I/O, GUI's, collections and threads. That's genuinely Java in a nutshell.<br />The author can offer such a stripped-down book, of course, because he assumes that the reader already understands programmatic flow control and objects, and can follow a basic inheritance hierarchy without tedious explanation.<br />Java isn't a difficult language: it can merely be made to seem so by textbooks that bury simple facts under mountains of verbiage.

As obvious as that might sound to most technical workers, companies continue to teach a command and control approach using bribes to coerce staff into certain behaviors.

The book is buzzword heavy and assumes a great deal of prior knowledge. Terms like lambda calculus, process calculi, PKI, six sigma and BPML are scattered throughout and not generally explained. The authors make a rather poor attempt at explaining Business Process Modeling Language (BPML), which lies at the heart of BPM (BPML is similar in format to XML and generates flowcharts), but otherwise you're on your own.<br />The overall tone of the book is abrasive. Smith and Fingar rail against \\"technology gods\\" and \\"cast in concrete\\" data stovepipes. They lament the disruptive and \\"painful reengineering\\" second wave advocated by their former colleague, James Champy. They see the main differentiator of BPM as being its ability to connect outwards to partner businesses.<br />What Smith and Fingar hope to achieve with business process engineering is to cut IT entirely out of the business change loop. They envisage being able to completely describe all business processes in BPML diagrams - down to the \\"Coke\\" machine's inputs (coins) and outputs (cans of soda). This way, business managers need never deal with IT folk again, and they can outsource entire processes by exposing the relevant sections of BPML to subcontractors.<br />It's truly hard to tell from the book how much of this is blue sky and how much is part of the trend already underway. Either way it behooves anyone who might be in a position to benefit from BPM -- or to get trampled by the BPM steamroller -- to familiarize themselves with the subject.	2003-01-19

There's nothing new in the book, except the way the authors have combined tried-and-true techniques to handle very large business application development in a consistent and low-risk manner. The smallest headcount that could justify the overhead is about twenty, although it could scale up almost indefinitely.  Palmer and Johnson describe their methodology as light but, on a scale of five (heavy) to one (agile), FDD rates about a four.<br />The second point is that the techniques used assume very heavy customer involvement and clearly understood business rules. For example, the original project that inspired the book was a banking system in Asia. The procedures wouldn't be well-suited to innovative product development in a competitive environment. This is no alternative to extreme programming.<br />Lastly, the methods used aim to get good results from inexperienced employees. Despite a reminder that highly-ranked programmers are better value than entry-level personnel, this type of project often relies on an army of tightly-controlled programmers, led by a few experienced team leaders. Although the authors differentiate the FDD organization from the old Chief Surgeon model, this is still basically just a variant on that theme. <br />There are also more than a few hints that the book is not intended solely, or even primarily, for US readers. We are abjured to speak in English and leaders are advised to use a soccer whistle to control meetings. As beautifully as the authors describe how to divide up a large project by feature (and it is beautifully clear and simple), some of the advice in handling personnel leads me to hesitate before recommending it without reservation to every potential reader, which is the criterion Amazon requires for a 5-star rating.	2003-01-01

This collection of fifty-five software facts and ten fallacies is distilled from his forty-five years of programming experience. Much of it is the kind of thing your grandmother could have told you -- if your grandmother was a programmer -- but some items will surprise and others annoy some people. <br />Take the following two items as examples:<br />\\"The 60/60 rule: 60 percent of software's dollar is spent on maintenance, and 60 percent of that maintenance is enhancement.\\"<br />\\"Understanding the existing product consumes roughly 30 percent of the total maintenance time.\\" <br />That implies that one of the most valuable skills you can teach a Computer Science student is how to *read* code. But as Glass points out (and he taught graduate students for a while) CS courses only teach students to *write* programs, and then they don't often grade the code on readability.<br />The section on design, which Glass describes as the most intellectual phase of a software project, is the best description of how software designers actually work that I've ever read. He claims that top-ranked designers routinely ignore or subvert the methodologies used by their shops in order to do the job the right way. He has an especial warning for anyone trying to develop anything other than the most trivial program using XP.<br />The ten fallacies may have taken some well-known quotes out of context. Surely Eric Raymond of the open source movement didn't really mean, \\"Given enough eyes all bugs are shallow\\", to be taken literally. Either way, the point Glass is trying to make is that, without proof, we shouldn't *assume* that open source code is less buggy than proprietary code.<br />Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering is aimed at two audiences: those without Glass' 45 years of programming experience, and those who have it but, like all good professionals, want to refresh the basics. Since some of the wisdom came with useful statistics that I've never seen published before, I'd recommend the book to anyone involved in developing or maintaining software.	2002-12-02

Most technical books I read once and pass on to the public library. I kept these books because it's so easy to quickly find in them what I need --  and yet they are very complete. Everything is here in one book. <br />Each CICS command is laid out in a set format: function, syntax, options, exceptional conditions, notes &amp; tips and a coding example. Most of them fit on two pages and you have everything you need to use the command in one location. <br />The book covers traditional items, such as BMS maps, VSAM files, and CICS service transactions, such as CEDF and CEMT. It also has a nice section explaining how to code programs that have a web interface, including how to generate and manipulate HTML documents. <br />I was also pleased to see that the occasional places where C programs behave differently from COBOL programs were documented. That's the kind of detail most books on CICS don't bother to mention, which can be very frustrating. But I couldn't find anything that was missing from this book.	2002-11-12

Rusch's vision of a humanity that utterly flunks its first interactions with alien species rings completely true. The aliens in \\"The Disappeared\\" don't just look and sound different from us, they make fundamentally different assumptions about right and wrong, fair and unfair.	2002-10-10

I thoroughly enjoyed Pete McBreen's immoderate attack on heavy-duty software engineering practices in &quot;Software Craftsmanship&quot; and I had expected more of the same in &quot;Questioning Extreme Programming&quot;. But McBreen comes across more like a schoolmaster reluctantly telling his favorite pupil that he only got a B. His point is that the conditions for XP to be successful are almost never found in nature: a dedicated customer, enthusiastic programmers, trusting management, an &quot;expressive&quot; language, a non-political office and a talented team &quot;coach&quot;. He makes one other strong warning:<br />&quot;If the majority of your projects involve writing life- or safety-critical embedded software, please don't even think about using XP.&quot;<br />That's a peculiar sentiment to express about a methodology whose main selling point is supposed to be that it produces a higher quality product. But the only claim that McBreen makes for XP is that programmers would have fought to introduce eXtreme methods to their shop have found the experience &quot;fun&quot;. Ultimately, McBreen seems to be saying that XP is better than old-style software engineering, but so is almost every other modern software practice.<br />Q. If XP is the answer, what was the question? <br />A. What is the best way to write a program in *Smalltalk*?	2002-09-28
US	36885193	R3PIUKVWRMPIFL	0446609641	78385270	Time Past	Books	5	9	10	N	N	new style of space science fiction	I haven't enjoyed a sci-fi novel so much since Neal Stephenson's Diamond Age -- not that Time Past is a derivative of anyone else's work. This is a new style of writing space science fiction that I haven't seen before.<br />The characters in Time Past speak and act like real people: they don't have the theatrical quality and stilted speech of many sci-fi characters, who have to 'explain' what the book reader can't see or hear. You don't get spoon fed each fact just as you need it, the way you do in television scripts.  But this also isn't one of those books where you're left guessing at the end.<br />The best sci-fi novels have always offered a 'point' rather than just being robotized cops-and-robbers. Time Past considers the way we misreport history, making saints and villains out of more mundane folk and ascribing every event of their day to them, whether they were personally involved or not. It also questions how loyalty and authority work in groups and larger communities. And it considers the trade-off between today's needs and the needs of the future. <br />That's a lot of weight to put on a book that also maintains a taut storyline and a large cast of characters, humanoid and other. It says something for McArthur's ability to keep the flow of the narrative that I didn't find myself checking back every few pages to see who was who and what they'd done.<br />At the end of the book I found a short bio of Maxine McArthur. She's an Australian who's lived most of her adult life in Japan. Writing is her second career. Maybe it's having lived a rich life that has enabled her to write books that are both complex and intelligent, and explains her ease with intercultural (interspecies?) relationships.	2002-07-07

The West has its Judeo-Christian traditions and Puritan work ethic: China has Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism. There's a saying that only the fish doesn't know water: we have to leave our surroundings to understand them. Adeline Yen Mah left French-occupied Shanghai and British-administered Hong Kong to earn a medical degree in England from Oxford University, and then worked in the US as a doctor for thirty years. Now she's on a mission to explain to us what makes the other one fourth of the world's population 'tick'.<br />This isn't a textbook, and it isn't an autobiography, although the author draws heavily from her experience of living with her adored Buddhist grandfather. It's a meandering walk through Chinese history (all 8,000 or more years of it) and Chinese foods, medicine, language and writing. We learn how Confucius (Kong Fu Zi) strove to rid China of its cruel mandarin ruling class and replace it with an educated meritocracy -- and left a long-term legacy of a stultifying bureaucracy and contempt for feminine intellect. We learn how Taoism was subverted into a set of kitschy superstitions. And how Buddhism merged with Chinese thought to become Zen.<br />The book is beautifully presented. The paper is fine quality and the text clear and well laid out. Dr Yen often gives the traditional Chinese ideograms for Chinese words and explains their derivation. What we write and what we say is what we think. No wonder the Chinese government has difficulty with the concepts of 'human rights' and 'privacy' when they have no words for them. And we have no words for tao or li or qi. We have a lot to learn.	2002-06-25

The Salmon of Doubt is an unexpected mixed bag of short pieces composed from the odds and ends he left on his hard drive after his untimely death in 2001.<br />There are a couple of fairly substantial pieces from what might have been the sixth chapter of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and another \\"Dirk Gently\\" novel. Just a few touches of classic Adams show through:<br />\\"... The following morning the weather was so foul it hardly deserved the name, and Dirk decided to call it Stanley instead....\\"<br />Some of the other, shorter pieces are curiously personal. There are several items about his concern for the world's wildlife --  including his personal favorite, saving the rhinos of Africa. He understood that you have to help the people in Africa help the rhinos. He comes across as a very nice man. <br />For some reason, I'd always thought of Douglas Adams as a nerdy type -- like his hero Arthur Dent in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. But this book tells us he was a big man, a jovial, boyish 6 foot 5 inches. He grew up on comic books and loved (and performed) music all his life. Although the pieces on his computer were probably not sent to the publisher for good reason, this is a curiously touching anthology.<br />We miss you, Doug.	2002-06-17
US	36885193	R1PLQ0KN51XI2R	0743215362	869948861	Tesla: Man Out of Time	Books	5	5	7	N	N	Fascinating biography for any physicist or engineer	Nikola Tesla, a Serbian immigrant to America, was a strange man. He was frequently referred to in the press as a 'mad genius', and previous biographies have been sensational, rather than informative.<br />Tesla thought in pictures rather than words (like Einstein) and had a photographic memory until well into his adult life. At least three of his senses, hearing, sight and touch, were sufficiently over-developed that they caused him physical discomfort. He was an intuitive thinker: he grasped concepts as a whole, and then worked backwards, painfully and not always successfully, to realize the practical details that would utilize his grand ideas. He was able to model and test equipment in his head, rotating it as needed and putting it through its paces, so that when the equipment was finally built, it worked perfectly the first time.<br />The problem, admitted by biographer Cheney, is that an inventor who goes directly from mental concept to patent papers leaves a thin trail behind him as to his thought processes. The constant need to obtain funding for his experiments and the legal ramifications of being first to patent new ideas, meant that Tesla -- already a loner by nature -- was driven to keep his work as secret as possible. Cheney finally located his private papers in a government department, out of sight under lock and key. <br />Tesla was more of a scientist than the purely practical Edison, his main competitor for funding. Although some of his more famous patents -- the Tesla coil and 'polyphase' (i.e. alternating current) electricity -- became the foundation of American engineering before World War II, other patents were filed and not followed up on as Tesla lost interest in them. He filed patents for a transistor and for wireless broadcasting. But it was Shockley et al who build the first working modern computers (and received the Nobel prize) and Marconi who transmitted the first long-distance wireless messages and is generally recognized as the founder of modern broadcasting.<br />Biographer Cheney has presented as much of the material on Tesla's life as seems currently available except, of course,  for the patents themselves, which are publicly available. It is up to us, the readers, to try and understand how the mind of this inventive genius worked based on our own knowledge of both science and psychology. That doesn't seem an unreasonable chore on behalf of a man who once said:<br />&quot;I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success.&quot;	2002-05-27

That gave me a better feel for how use cases work than the usual Bank Customer Withdraws Cash or Online Customer Makes Puchase. As far as system software is concerned, Cockburn says:<br />&quot;Occasionally I hear someone complain that it is hard to describe the requirements for a tape merge operation or a compiler with use cases. I wholeheartedly agree. Those are best described using algebraic or tabular forms.&quot;<br />* Can I go straight from use cases to design?<BR>One of the misconceptions I had was that you could design directly from use cases. Cockburn goes to some trouble to explain that there is no one-to-one mapping between use cases and code, although use cases do make an excellent basis for test cases.<br />&quot;The design doesn't cluster by use case. Blindly following the use case structure leads to functional decomposition designs (this is really of concern to object-oriented and component design teams.)&quot;<br />* How do use cases relate to requirements?<BR>The most valuable concept I obtained from &quot;Writing Effective Use Cases&quot; was that the primary value of use cases is to tease out the complete requirements, including how failures should be handled, from the potential customers of the system. <br />&quot;[The use case] becomes a communication device between the different stakeholders on the project&quot;.<br />Recommended by the author:<BR>Mastering the Requirements Process by Suzanne and James Robertson	2002-05-05

Nine different methods are presented by an international team of software experts like Larry Constantine and Philippe Kruchten. <br />All the authors are trying to solve constraints or deficiencies in existing methods. Since these are all new or experimental techniques, each author explains exactly what problem s/he is trying to solve, where the new method might be best used, and how it worked in practice. Most of the sections work through a couple of cases, so you can see how the method works.<br />A couple of the writers have pointed out how difficult current heavy-weight methodologies are to use. The models generated, unless the modeler is extremely experienced, are usually not correct. What's more, as the first chapter notes, the modelers don't realize that their models are bad. A couple of writers have tried to deal with the problem that business customers can't understand UML-style notation, and don't mentally describe their jobs in terms of classes or windows. That cuts customers out of the system design process at exactly the point where they should be most engaged.<br />The editor repeats what is generally recognized: that very few people use a methodology as such. Most of us use a grab bag of techniques from a mix of methods, heavily customized to our own needs. Mark van Harmelen's book may be best addressed to those who use mixed methods, because it helps us to see how experienced architects decide which techniques to use in different circumstances and how we can determine whether we were successful.	2002-03-31

That must be why everything is clearly explained, rather than just giving the syntax and leaving it at that. In addition to the chapters on JCL, there are sections on ISPF, SMS, VSAM, IDCAMS, IBM utilities (IEBCOPY etc.), SORT, REXX and UNIX system services.<br />In other words, this is a very handy general purpose mainframe reference book, that will earn its place on my bookshelf.	2002-03-25
