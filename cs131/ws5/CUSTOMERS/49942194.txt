Move To Strike continues with single mom, and recently widowed lawyer, Nina Reilly. Nina takes on the case of Nikki Zack, a rebellious teenager, who is friends with Nina's son, Bob. Nikki is up for first degree murder of her uncle, Bill Skyes, a wealthy plasic surgeon. Although Nikki was at her uncles home the night he was killed to steal from him, she claims she didn't do it. To make matters more interesting, Nikki's cousin and Bill Skyes son, Chris is killed in a plane crash the same night. Nina believes Nikki knows more than she is saying, but Nikki is keeping secret what exactly she saw that night. Nina hires Paul Van Wagoner, a ex love and private detective who always helps her out. Paul and Nina dig up motive to kill from quite a few, and have to rely on the facts they discover to help Nikki out. Move To Strike is another page turner we've come to expect from O'Shaunessy. Nina Reilly is a great heroine, that I hope sticks around for more great novels!	2001-06-18

The Villa is Nora Roberts newest novel, which centers around the Giambelli-MacMillan winery and vineyards. Sophia Giambelli is the grandaughter of matriarch Tereza Giambelle. Tereza announces big changes for the company, including putting Sophia and Tyler MacMillan working together to learn the ins and outs of each others job. As changes are being made at Giambelli-MacMillan, someone is trying to sabotage the company, even going as far as murder to ruin the family name and business. As always Nora throws in a cast of characters that are so easy to enjoy and love (from Sophia's mom-Pilar, Tyler's grandpa-Eli, David-the new COO, Theo and Maddy-David's kids, the list goes on and on). The Villa if full of the excitement you can expect from Nora Roberts, not to mention the romance (espically the heat coming from Sophia and Ty! What a great couple!). P.S. Even the ending was a shocker that was not expected!!	2001-06-06

As they spend the week together in the romantic atmosphere they soon become lovers. The beginning of the book is more like a fantasy and fairy tale as Caren and Derek become &quot;soul mates&quot; within hours of meeting. Once back from their vacation the book starts to pick up and become more realistic. Caren finds that Derek has a secret he failed to tell her and she finds herself in a terrible situation. Tiger Prince is slow starting and once you get past the vacation in Jamaica it picks up the pace and becomes a pretty decent romance novel.	2001-05-28

Teil McCoy, a news reporter is headed for her vacation destination when the radio announces that Russell Dendy's (a local wealthy powerful man)daughter has been kidnapped from school. Teil immediately calls off her vacation so she can scoop the story. How convienent for Teil that when she stops at a store for refreshments who should come in to rob the place? None other than......you guessed it, Russell Dendy's very pregnant daughter, Sabra, and her &quot;kidnapper&quot; boyfriend, Ronnie. While in the store holding it up, Sabra goes into labor. A mysterious handsome stranger named &quot;Doc&quot; is able to help Sabra, along with Teil's assistance. To make a long story short, the whole book revolves around the holdup and Sabra's labor, placing the whole setting in the convience store in one nights time. Of course Doc and Teil become attracted to you, which is very hard to believe. Who has time for romance in between being hostages and delivering a baby? Standoff is hard to believe and not one of Sandra's best attempts at a novel.	2001-05-14

Jim and his brother Alex were skiing when Alex had an accident that left him dead. Jim's family has turned against him and believes he is responsible for the death. Nina prepares to defend Jim, but is doubting whether she believes his story or not. In the meantime, assistant DA, Collier Hollowell returns after being gone from the last book. As always I am once again disappointed in the way Nina can never make her mind up between Collier and Paul, the detective she often hires. In one book, she loves Paul, in the next, it's Collier. Make your mind up already!!! Acts of Malice doesn't have as much twists and turns as O'Shaughnessy's other novels, but can still be a good read if you stick with it. The ending is a for sure shock, that I still can't get over.	2001-04-30

Lindy is a extremely wealthy woman who has built a multi-million dollar company with her husband, Mike. Mike dumps Lindy for a younger woman, and leaves Lindy with nothing. Lindy hires Nina to help her win half of their assets although legally, Mike does not have to give Lindy a dime, because all assets are in Mike's name alone, and because they actually never married, Lindy hardly stands a chance. Nina has to prove to a jury that Lindy is entitled to half of the $200 million, since Lindy and Mike built the company together and lived their lives as a married couple for years. Nina soon realizes that when that much money is at stake, people will go to extremes, even to kill if that's what it takes. With a combination of secrets, murder, and money, Breach of Promise delivers another suspensful thriller from the O'Shaughnessy's. Can't wait for the next one!!	2001-04-13

In this book, Nina Reilly and DA Collier Hallowell go on a date hiking. First of all the date was a little weird, considering in the last book Nina and Paul had something going on. Anyway, while on their hike they witness Ray de Beer's death from a lighting crash. The death brings back old memories for Collier of his deceased wife Anna, who was killed in a hit and run accident. Collier hires Paul to try and find clues from Anna's death. In the meantime, Ray de Beer's son, Jason is indicted for murder, and Nina is defending him. As Paul and Nina find out, Anna Hallowell's and Ray de Beer's death are more related that one might think. Obstruction of Justice fits right in with the previous two books in this series, as all are hard to put down, and are great reads. In this book, the only problem I had was that the ending was a stretch and quite unbelievable. Other than that, Obstruction of Justice, is another winner from the O'Shaughnessy's.	2001-04-06

Invasion of Privacy continues with Nina Reilly, the lawyer who we first meet in Motion to Suppress, the first novel by Perri O'Shaughnessy. Nina is defending Terry London, a filmmaker who is being sued over a film she made about a young girl who has been missing for 12 years. Terry is a quite diffucult lady to get along with and Nina decides to persuade her to find another lawyer. Before this change happens, Terry turns up dead, shot to death in her own house. The man seen coming from Terry's house is someone very close to Nina's past, that she has not seen in years. Of course he is being held for the murder, which he says he did not do, and Nina decides to defend him, not really knowing for sure if she can believe him or not. The damaging evidence is a videotape Terry tapes as she is dying. Nina has to work hard to find the evidence to set her client free, which in the process she runs across something that could destroy her family forever. Invasion of Privacy is another hit by Perri O'Shaughnessy, which is a hard to put down page turner that had me up till the wee hours.	2001-03-25

I am just curious to know why I haven't heard of Perri O'Shaughnessy before now. The first book (as I understand this is a continuing series), Motion to Suppress, is a thrilling book with the plot thickening each chapter, and definetley plenty of twists.I just can't believe this book has been out since 1995, and I haven't heard the name before now!! I am so disappointed to have not found the authors (Perri O'Shaughnessy is the pen name for two sisters writing together) earlier! In Motion To Suppress, Nina Reilly is a lawyer who has just opened her own practice in Lake Tahoe. She takes on her first case, which is a wife, named Misty Patterson, who is accussed of killing her husband. The kicker is that Misty remembers hitting him while they were arguing, but doesn't remember anything thereafter. Of course when her husband turns of dead, Misty is to blame. Nina is in a race to find the truth about the murder, and finds lots of &quot;interesting&quot; facts along the way. I overly enjoyed the whole book, right to the very end. The only reason I gave Motion To Suppress one star short of perfect is because the writing is hard to understand and wordy in places, which can be expected since this is the debut novel, and will get better with each novel. Other than that Motion To Supress is a great mystery/thriller that will leave you guessing throughout the whole book, not to mention changing your mind on &quot;who do it&quot; with each passing chapter. Perri O'Shaughnessy is a winner!	2001-03-20

Logan has to heavily persuaded, to the point of blackmail, search and rescuer Sarah Patrick and her dog Monty to help him find his employee and the kidnapper.As Sarah finds out, a little too late, the kidnapper is after more than money, he is a person from Logan's past that is back for revenge, leaving everyone, herself and Monty in danger.

Callie was raised at Parker Manor, as was Bode Jessup, who was taken in by the Parker family, both were raised by the wonderful Mama Pearl. Sela Bronson and Brie Canfield are the other two friends who spend their childhood days playing with Callie and Bode. As they all gather for the Callie's wedding, Callie is involved in an accident that puts her in a coma. The whole story drags on and on about daily visits to Callie, how tired they all are, whats for supper, etc., and spends way too much time on racial issues. Callie is a spoiled snot who expects the world from Mama Pearl and never realizes how much her friends gave her. Which surprises me how Brie, Bode, and Sela can even consider her a friend, let alone how Mama Pearl can love her so much! Yesterday just did not have enough juice to keep me going and is not worth the time or energy to wade through!	2001-02-26

He is the reason I gave this book 3 stars. The book starts with someone breaking into Jesse LeBeau's house and trying to kill her. Jesse and King were raised together by King's father, after Jesse's dad died. So King comes to rescue Jesse and bring her back home to the Double M Ranch, so he can protect and take care of her. What King doesn't realize is that when Jesse ran away three years before, it was because she was in love with King, but he only saw her as a sister. Now that Jesse is back she wants to make King love her, and NOT as a sister!! The story line could have actually made a good book, but it was obvious from the beginning who was behind the murder (which was actually suppossed to be a kidnapping). And something else that turned me off was the way anything Jesse did was portrayed as &quot;life threatning&quot;. It just made Jesse seem like she was a push over. About the only thing King's Ransom had going for it was the King himself!!	2001-02-16

So, of course, I had to find the book and read it before the movie came out. Now I'm looking forward to the movie, which airs February 28th. In Sanctuary, Jo Ellen Hathaway, a famous photographer, starts getting pictures in the mail of herself and one of her mother, who the family always believed left them over 20 years ago. Jo Ellen goes home to Sanctuary where she meets up with Nathan Delaney, a childhood friend, who has also come back, to eventually tell the Hathaway family that he believes their mother didn't leave them, but was murdered. Jo Ellen is still being stalked while on the island, what she doesn't realize is the stalker is out to kill her also. Sanctuary was a good suspense novel, although it didn't leave much guess as to who the killer was. I did enjoy seeing the family overcome their bitterness toward each other, and see them all find love. Hope the movie is as good as the book!	2001-02-11

Considering Kate is a follow up from the Stanislaski series that Nora Roberts wrote a few years back (but is now re-released). Kate Kimball, the daughter of Natasha and Spencer (from Taming Natasha), is a ballet dancer, who has come home to open a dance school. Brody O'Connell is the contractor who fixes up the building for Kate's school. Kate and Brody automatically hit it off, but Brody is leary of a relationship because he is a widow with a 6 year old son, Jack, to take care of. Kate is flirtatious and pushes Brody to take her out, Brody on the other hand is trying to resist her, although he wants her. In Considering Kate all the characters are winners. You will fall head over heels for little Jack, not too mention the rest of the family. Considering Kate is a great read, and a great follow up. I really got into the whole family and at times found myself laughing and tearing up, which I think a good book should make a person do!	2001-02-04

Heart of the Sea is the final book in Nora Roberts Irish trilogy. It is a great read, and even better series. In this book Darcy Gallagher, the only Gallagher sibling yet to find love, meets Trevor Mcgee. Trevor is in Adamore, the quaint Irish village, to build a music theater, which will be part of the Gallagher Pub. Darcy has always dreamed of marrying rich, and of course Trevor is loaded. Their relationship starts as a cat and mouse game, but evolves into something neither of them expects....love. Darcy doesn't want to admit she loves Trevor for fear that he doesn't feel the same way. While Trevor doesn't want to express his feelings because he thinks Darcy just wants what his money can buy. Of course Gwen and Carrick are there to help them, as they themselves want Darcy and Trevor to unite, to break the century old spell against their love. Heart of the Sea touches base with the rest of the family: Aidan and preganant Jude, Shawn and Brenna, and of course the rest of the pub gang. I have to say that out of the three books this one was a little slower. It seemed as if Darcy wasn't portrayed the same as she was in the first two books. Not that I didn't love the book, it was still good, as it connected with the rest of the series, it just seemed to lack something between Darcy and Trevor. The whole trilogy is a definte read. All in all you gotta love those Irish!!	2001-01-20

In Tears Of The Moon Shawn Gallagher and Brenna O'Toole, lifelong friends, find they have an attraction for one another. Both couldn't be more different. Shawn is a laid back cook for the family pub and doesn't rush to do anything. On the other hand, Brenna is a feisty, always in a hurry &quot;handy woman&quot; who works with her father. What makes Tears Of The Moon so great is the difference in the Shawn and Brenna. Believe me, there is never a dull moment with these two!! The story continues as both realize they are in love, but neither is ready to admit it, for fear they might jeopordize their frienship in the long run. As in the first of this Irish series, Jewels Of The Sun, we meet up with Lady Gwen and Carrick, both ghosts from centuries ago. Carrick placed a spell on his and Gwen's love long ago. Now in order to break the spell, he has to match up three couples and have them discover love. So of course, he has two down with one left. We can only guess that this will be Darcy Gallagher in the next, and last, book of the series! What a riot that should be!! Hope everyone enjoys Tears Of The Moon as much as I did, it is laugh out loud fun. No kidding!!	2001-01-07

Although I have had Jewels Of The Sun since it was released, I just now read it. I had a feeling I would fall in love with characters so quick and easy, as with all Nora's series, I wanted to wait till I had all books in hand before starting. As hard as the wait was, it was well worth it!!! In Jewels Of The Sun, we meet Jude Frances Murray, a professor from Chicago. Realizing the life she is living isn't for her, she runs off to Ireland to find herself. While there she meets Aidan Gallagher, who runs the local pub. While Jewels Of The Sun centers around Jude and Aidan falling in love, it also involves a tale of Gwen and Carrick, both ghosts from centuries ago searching for lost love. As far fetched as I believe ghost tales are, I found myself losing myself in the whole Irish/faerie/ghost scene. I have already fallen in love with the whole gang in the book, and can't wait to finish the rest of the series. Boy, I am so glad I waited now!! Between Jude and Aidan, you can't leave out the rest of the Gallagher siblings (Shawn and Darcy), not to mention Brenna O'Toole, what a hoot they are!!! I could go on and on about characters you will just love, but I will leave it to you to read this series and see for yourself. Believe me Jewels Of The Sun won't dissappoint.

Don't get me wrong, the book was good, if your'e in the mood for a quick and light read. Dani Quinn and Logan Webster reunite at their ten year class reunion. Both were in love in high school and they got married right after graduation, only to have Dani's parents wisk her away to have the marriage annualled, because they felt Logan wasn't good enough for her. Dani has come back to talk Logan into giving the charity she works for some land that he owns. Logan is willing to give her the land, in exchange for spending time with him, hoping to win her love back. In A Class By Itself is your basic love story, zooming through the plot and leaving a lot unanswered.

Both save her, but she has lost all her memory, so they call her Lucky, since she can't remember her name. Greg starts to discover clues about Lucky and they soon figure out that someone tried to kill her, not that she ran off the cliff.

Another believer dies in this book, while we gain two more. The safe house if found out and they find a new place to hide out. And of course, Nicolae comes back from the dead, which takes place at his own funeral. Even though The Indwelling was slower than the other books you still need to read it to keep up with the series.

Rayford and Ken Ritz end up having to rescue Tsion, Buck, and Chloe from Jerusalem, since Nicolae and the GC forces are after them. This event proves to be very exciting and full of drama. The locusts also comes in this book. They start stinging all non-believers, and they have to suffer for 5 months. In such pain many try to kill themselves but cannot die. Apollyon stays with the beat of the rest of this series. It keeps you in suspense and pushes you to hurry and finish to find out what happens. As with the rest of the series....so far, so good!	2000-09-21

I think I have said this of each book, but Soul Harvest has been the best  yet of the series! The story takes place after the anticipated earthquake.  There is lots of mystery in this book with Rayford and Buck trying to find  Amanda and Chloe (both are either lost or dead, and Rayford and Buck have  no idea which). We also get to meet other believers in this story, such as  Mac and Ken, who both have finally come to believe. Of course we also see  more of the evil Nicolae is capable of. I really have to say that each book  keeps getting better and better. Soul Harvest kept me glued in my seat till  I finished it! I can't wait to start book #5, Apollyon, because if the  books stay the way they have been going, Apollyon will be GREAT!!!	2000-09-17

First off I have to say that I am glad I'm starting this series after most of the books have been published! Both Left Behind, and the follow up,  Tribulation Force had such &quot;shocking&quot; endings, I don't think I  could have waited for the next books to be published. Although I have just  finished the second book, I am really into this series and can't wait to  start the next one. In Tribulation Force we see Rayford, Chloe, Buck, and  Bruce pull to together to study what is to come in the next seven years. We  also see Nicolae work his evil ways to get the power he wants. It was nice  though to see a love between Buck and Chloe develop, espically when they  need all the happiness they can get. I have been telling everyone about  this series it has struck me as being so wonderful! So now I'll tell you  too, read up and enjoy!	2000-08-31

Just about everyone I know has read or is reading this series of books. I kept saying I didn't think I would enjoy it, because I am not a church  goer, and I am embarrassed to say, I don't know ANYTHING about the Bible. I  finally gave in and borrowed a friend's copy of Left Behind. Halfway  through I was begging her to bring me the other books in the series! Left  Behind is easy to understand and very self explanatory about Rapture. I  feel I am learning a part of the Bible in a fun and interesting way. I feel  that this book has changed me in a way. I'm already relaying the book to my  husband and telling him we really need to consider starting church. Left  Behind is great and I'm so excited to start the next books!	2000-08-22
US	49942194	R4VPQ90PJ237E	0446608653	287482638	The Alibi	Books	4	6	6	N	N	One Star Short	The Alibi had a great story line and was hard to put down. I gave it one  star short of five stars because I felt like the main character, Hammond  Cross, who is the Assistant D.A., was lacking in likeablilty. I won't say  much about the storyline, because I don't want to give it away. Basically  The Alibi is about a influential man, Lute Pettijohn being murdered. Every  character in the book basically has motive to murder him, it's just a  search to find out who did. In comes Alex Ladd, who is accused of the  murder, but has a &quot;secret&quot; alibi, that will rock the case if it  comes out. I recommend The Alibi as a great read. Espically if you are a  Sandra Brown fan. This book doesn't dissappoint as a few of her latest  releases does.	2000-08-13

First off I want to say that if you are a total mystery buff and not into romance, do not read this book! I read this title after finishing my first  Tami Hoag book, Ashes to Ashes. Dark Paradise is nothing like it. This book  is mainly a romance between J.D. and Marilee. Marilee comes into a small  town to visit her best friend Lucy, only to find that Lucy is dead. The  longer she is there she starts to believe it wasn't a hunting accident, as  the town has said, that killed Lucy. Determined to find the truth, she  starts doing some investigating on her own. While in the meantime she fills  her free time with J.D., where, of course, a love blossoms. I enjoy  romances, but for some reason Dark Paradise didn't really hit me like I  felt it should. I went and bought most of Tami Hoag's earlier releases, I  just hope I enjoy them more that this one.	2000-08-06

This is my first Tami Hoag book, and believe me, it won't be my last. Ashes to Ashes is about a serial killer that the press has named &quot;The Cremator&quot;, because he sets his victims on fire. After a teenage girl,  named Angie witnesses the &quot;Cremator&quot; as he burnes one of his  victims, in comes Kate Conlan of the victims unit. She tries to help Angie  tell what she saw, but she is to scared to talk about it. When the police  find out that one of the victims is the daughter of a local billionaire,  John Quinn of the FBI is brought in. John and Kate have a past together and  this brings them back together after 5 years.  Ashes to Ashes had me  changing my mind every chapter about who I thought the &quot;Cremator&quot;  was. There was always something new popping up that would make me have to  continue reading to find out what it was. Believe me this book is a good  one that will keep you up well past bedtime! Now I have to rush out and buy  more Tami Hoag books!	2000-07-14

I have read all three available books in the Donovan series and I have to say that Pearl Cove is the best yet! It centers around Archer, the oldest Donovan sibling, and Hannah, his stepbrothers widow. Archer and Hannah are  out to find the Black Trinity, a pearl necklace that is stolen from Hannah  and her deceased husband. I think Pearl Cove was so good because in the  first two novels Archer seems so &quot;tough&quot;. We actually find out  that he is a &quot;softie with a big heart&quot;. It's hard not to fall in  love with him!  Pearl Cove was very good reading. It was also great to  visit with the other Donovans. Can't wait to read the next one!	2000-07-07

Jade Island is about Kyle Donovan, the youngest son of the six Donovans. Kyle meets up with Lianne,  who is being accussed of stealing the legendary Jade Emperor's Tomb.  Together Kyle and Lianne must convince the government that Lianne is  innocent, while falling in love at the same time. Jade Island is full of  excitement, laughs, and plenty of &quot;heat&quot; between Kyle and Lianne.  If you read Amber Room and was disappointed, as I was, this one will make  you want to finish the series.	2000-06-29

I enjoyed Amber Beach and can't wait to read the rest of the series. Jake and Honor make a good couple. Honor is hard-headed and has a  quick wit about her, she really makes their relationship  &quot;interesting&quot;. I only had one problem with the book and that was  that it was hard to understand about the &quot;Amber Room&quot; and all the  politics surrounding it. All in all Amber Beach is a good read. Now I'm off  to read the next book, Jade Island.	2000-06-23

This book, Two Alone, took me 4 days to read. It could not hold my interest enough to even pick it up. The story starts with Rusty and Cooper, who are the only  survivors of a plane crash. They have to depend on each other and survive  in the woods till they are rescued. The story, to me, really didn't go  anywhere. I didn't even enjoy Rusty and Cooper like I felt I should since  they are the main characters. Rusty was whiney throughout the book and  Cooper was rude and inconsiderate most of the time. To dislike each other  so much they sure fell in love awful quick. This is definetely not one of  Sandra Brown's best books, I enjoy her newer novels much better.	2000-06-15

Having just finished Irish Hearts and jumping straight into Irish Rebel I am a bit sad. I'm very upset to be leaving the Grant family! I absolutely fell in love with the whole gang of them! Irish Rebel continues with  Keeley, the oldest daughter of Dee and Travis, and with Brian, a horse  trainer Travis hires on. Keeley is a strong minded woman with a horsing  business of her own. Although they both realize they have come to love each  other, Brian doesn't feel is right to be with Keeley, since he is the hired  hand. Keeley has to try to make Brian see that she loves him regardless of  what he is. Irish Rebel was a great sequel to Irish Hearts. We got to visit  Dee, Travis, Paddy, Erin, and Burke from the first novel, and see the  children that are now grown up. It just breaks my heart that I'm finished  with the series! Maybe Nora could finish with the rest of the family, that  would be great!	2000-06-12

Both stories in this novel revolve around raising horses and racing them. The first story is about Travis and Adelia &quot;Dee&quot;. I was hooked on this couple right after the first chapter.  Dee is a feisty Irish and her temper turns Travis on even more. Needless to  say this couple is hilarous! The second story is about Burke and Erin.  Burke is so laid back and wants Erin so much he will do anything to have  her, but he doesn't realize he has fallen in love with her. Both stories in  this novel are wonderful! I don't know much about horses, and was surprised  to find myself cheering for the horses at the races. I felt like I was in  the stands myself! Both couples our so easy to like and you can feel  yourself losing yourself in their stories. I'm looking forward now to  starting the next novel to go with this book. It is called Irish Rebel and  it picks up with Travis and Dee's daughter, Keeley. Hope all enjoys Irish  Hearts as much as I did!	2000-06-06

This book kept you guessing till the very end, and I mean &quot;The End&quot;! Although I was almost positive I had it figured out, I was still shocked in  the end. This is a book that will keep you up at night trying to get closer  to finding out who done it. That's what makes Iris Johansen's books so  enjoyable. It was good to read about favorites from Face of Deception (Eve,  Joe, and Logan), and I really enjoyed the new characters (Jane, Sarah, and  of course Monty). I see where her next book is going to have Sarah, Monty,  and Logan in it. I can't wait to read it if it's as good as Killing Game!	2000-05-12

It was fun to see how everyone in the first books were doing (C.C., Trent, Amanda, Sloan, Lilah, Max, Suzanne, Holt, and you can't leave out the kids, CoCo and  Colleen!). Megan and Nate were perfect for each other and enjoyable to read  about. I also was glad to see that CoCo finally found her someone to love  (it was about time, after all she was the matchmaker for all the girls!).  If you haven't read the first four books, read them before reading this  book, it will make it a lot more enjoyable.	2000-04-18

Lilah and Suzanne's stories were a good follow up to the first of this series (C.C. and Amanda). I had a hard time staying into Lilah and Max's story. To me they just didn't seem to &quot;fit&quot; as a couple. Anyway,  this was the slowest story in all of the series. Suzanne and Holt's story  made up for it though, cause they were so easy to fall in love with. All in  all I enjoyed reading about the  Calhoun's. I really get into Nora Roberts  books when she does a series like this. You get the chance to find out what  happens after they fall in love and &quot;live happily ever after&quot;. I  just found out that there is a follow up to this series. It is a Silhoutte  romance called Megan's Mate. Megan is Sloan's sister (Sloan married  Amanda). Anyway I'm off to start it next!	2000-04-14

I enjoyed C.C., as she is nicknamed, because she is such a &quot;tomboy&quot;. C.C. and Trent are complete opposites who fall in love  with each other anyway. Their story is an enjoyable one. Second is Amanda  and Sloan. I liked this story best, out of the two. They bicker back and  forth just to get to each other. It is quite amusing and funny! Both  stories, were quick to jump to the &quot;love&quot; part of it, but they  were good romance reads, which I enjoyed. Next comes Lilah and Suzanne's,  the last two sisters, stories. I can't wait to get started, espically to  see how C.C., Trent, Amanda, and Sloan are doing.	2000-04-05

I fell in love with the Nouvelle family (including Mouse and LeClerc) from the very first chapter. Luke and Roxy were great together, you could feel the connection between them from the  time Luke joined the family, as a young boy.  I found myself close to tears  at times, sitting on the edge of my seat plenty, and laughing quite a lot.  Honest Illusions is a wonderful, magical read, you will just fall in love  with it!	2000-04-02

I gave it three stars because I enjoyed the two main characters, Cyn and Worth. But I felt like the book was rushed, all the way to the ending. I think this is one of Sandra's first romance novels, and she has definetely gotten better  over time. A Whole New Light was an ok book, but if you want a better  Sandra Brown book, buy one of her newer releases.	2000-03-19

First of all I have to say that I just sat here tonight and devoured this book in one sitting! I didn't realize when starting Send No Flowers, that it was a follow up to Breakfast In Bed. This story was about Alicia, who  was suppossed to marry Carter in Breakfast In Bed. I enjoyed Alicia and  Pierce both, along with Alicia's fiesty boys, Adam and David. The boys  really added spunk to the book because they craved a father so bad and were  young enough to say whatever comes to mind! It was nice to see Alicia meet  a good man like Pierce after all she had been through. I must say though,  that the &quot;problem&quot; that Pierce has is pretty much predictable,  and you can pretty much guess how the book is going to end. And another  thought I had is &quot;where does the title Send No Flowers come  from?&quot;. But definetely, Send No Flowers is another winner for Sandra  Brown!	2000-03-16

I absolutely fell in love with Emma and Kenny (espically Kenny, who I know has to be the HOTTEST man!). Not only will you enjoy Emma and Kenny, but Kenny's family (espically his sister Tori). Emma was always up to something  that had me cracking up. And Kenny was always one step ahead of the  determined Lady Emma to keep her out of trouble. Believe me these two are  absolutely hilarous together! I started this book on a Sunday night, and  all day at work Monday I couldn't wait to get home and finish it. Then when  I did get home to read, I noticed I was trying to drag out finishing the  book, all because I didn't want it to end! Lady Be Good is definetely a  wonderful book that you will absolutely fall in love with!	2000-03-15

And I haven't, I borrowed both the Testament (which I hated) and The Brethren. I just couldn't get into The Brethren. The way it skipped between the prison  and political story lines kept me confused, and wondering how they were  going to tie in together. I felt like through the whole book that it was  going nowhere. Nothing to keep me wanting to continue after each chapter,  no character to &quot;root&quot; for, and nothing special to really stand  out. I also felt like the ending was thrown together, like maybe it come  deadline time and John wasn't quite finished. To sum it up, The Brethren is  not worth the time or money. If you must read it, wait for the paperback or  borrow it.	2000-03-09

Although this book started out fast at first, it slowed down to where it just seemed to drag on. It was one of those books that I could have read or left. It didn't impress me that much. I felt it skipped a lot of important  information, such as Page and Simon's relationship. Who knows, maybe I was  expecting more romance than this novel had to offer.

Like all other Susan Elizabeth Phillip books it was a book you could sit back, relax, and totally get lost for an afternoon. First Lady made me literally laugh out loud at some of the funnier parts. My husband would ask me &quot;what is so funny?&quot;, so I  would have to tell him what was going on. I would definetely recommend  First Lady to anyone. If you've never read Susan Elizabeth Phillips and you  read this, believe me, you won't be able to wait to read her other titles.
