US	51391015	RE1XHIIVE6H1Q	0965874079	36777627	Teenagers Guide To The Beatles	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Great idea for a book	I bought this book at a festival for Beatles fans in Chicago.  While there, I had a chance to sit in on a discussion with the author.  It was easy to see he loves the Beatles and that the book was a labor of love for him.  I bought the book planning to give it to my 13 year old nephew, but I wanted to read it first.  Even though I'm a huge Beatles fan, there are lots of little stories and facts that I don't know about them.  I found several funny anecdotes and quotes I'd never heard before.<br /><br />While I am disappointed at the editing of the book, the content is great.  The book is like a timeline, covering each phase of the Beatles' careers in order.  It is written rather simplistically, which is fine, since it's targeted at kids and teens, and I think the length of the book is just right for kids.  It covers the Beatles' careers without putting in too many details kids may find boring.<br /><br />I think Mr. Lalani's idea to write a book introducing the Beatles to the younger generation is great, and he pulls it off well.  Since I was only one year old when the Beatles broke up, I had to learn about them through books, too, and I remember an oversized book with more pictures than text being my favorite.  This book, though, definitely tells their story better.  It's nice to have a general overview of their career in a concise, easy to read book.  I recommend it for anyone trying to explain the phenomenon known as The Beatles to a new generation.	2005-09-07

I love Christmas-themed stories, so one has to be really bad to disappoint me this much.  It's the only David Baldacci book I've read, and I thought maybe it was an anomaly, since he seems to be quite popular.  But I think I'll take \\"Sludge's\\" word for it and not read any others.	2005-09-06

This is the first book I've read by this author, and I suspect I'll be picking up some more.  The author includes just the right blend of romance and humor.  The lead characters are likable, if somewhat dense, as they usually are in this type of book.  They have to be dense in order to stay apart for most of the book for seemingly no good reason.  Heath, the high-powered, workaholic sports agent and Annabelle, the idealistic, romantic matchmaker are a classic case of opposites attract.  She balances him out perfectly.  Though they never met until Heath hired Annabelle to find him a wife, they have a circle of friends in common.  Many of Annabelle's strong, supportive female friends are married to men in the sports field.  The book also has a subplot going on featuring Annabelle's rival matchmaker, Portia Powers and Heath's assistant, Bodie.  Their story is just as interesting as the main one, and they'd make a great book themselves.  I highly recommend this light, fun romance.	2005-09-06

I'm an adult who sometimes likes to read teen fiction if there's a hook that draws me in.  The \\"hook\\" in this book, to me, is the fact that it takes place on a movie set.  \\"Fearless Productions\\" gets permission to film a movie at the private school Jessie and Tracy attend.  In what would be a dream come true for just about any teenage girl, Jessie unexpectedly lands a fairly big part, opposite Shane Rockett!  Shane is the hottest young actor in Hollywood, a real Southern charmer who calls every girl darlin'.  Although Tracy is jealous at first, she quickly gets over it when she's granted exclusive \\"backstage\\" access to take pictures of the actors and crew.  Though Jess is in a long-distance relationship with Marc, who lives in New Orleans, she can't fight the attraction she feels for Shane.  When Shane turns his charms on Jessie, all thoughts of Marc leave her head.  Shane tells Jess that this isn't just a one-movie fling - he plans on her coming to California to act in more movies together and being his girl.  And Jess can't help but want to believe him.<br /><br />Besides the romance with Shane and Jessie, the book has an element of mystery when Tracy's camera turns up missing.  It appears someone on the set doesn't want her pictures to be seen.  It could be anyone, since several people on the set are distrustful of Tracy.  They're afraid she's going to blab their secrets to the tabloids.  When an aging, not-well-liked star's trailer starts on fire with her in it, Jessie and Tracy find they have the answer to the who-dunnit right in Tracy's camera.<br /><br />I think the subject of Hollywood coming to a small town will appeal to girls.  The book is very current, mentioning names of real Hollywood stars that are hot right now.  This could make the book seem dated in a short time, given the fickle nature of the entertainment world.  Even with the Jessie/Shane romance, it's pretty wholesome, so I think girls as young as 10 and maybe up to age 16 would enjoy it.  Older girls may find it too tame.e, so I think girls as young as 10 and maybe up to age 16 would enjoy it.  Older girls may find it too tame.	2005-08-22
US	51391015	R19SYHXPJZ3UJJ	0758204418	616615582	Lone Calder Star	Books	3	14	15	N	N	Getting better	I'm pleased to say that this latest Calder book is much better than the last one.  While I don't think the newer books will ever be as good as the first few in the series, I hope Ms. Dailey continues to improve.  This book doesn't take place on the Triple C ranch, and I think it could easily be read as a stand-alone book for someone who never read the earlier books.  Chase, Cat and Jessy are mentioned, but you don't really need to know any of the Calder history to understand this book.  The story focuses on Quint Echohawk, Cat's son with Logan.  As with all the Calder men, he is strong and honorable.  Jessy sends him to the Cee Bar ranch, the land they own in Texas, to see what's going on there.  The last ranch hand on the Cee Bar has up and left without telling anyone or giving a reason.  After arriving in Texas, Quint quickly learns that the Rutledges are responsible for scaring off all the employees.  They are trying to buy all the land in the area, and they're using any means necessary to do it.  The first person Quint gets to know in Texas is Dallas, a waitress/store clerk/student who has some experience of her own with the Rutledges.  She and her grandfather, Empty Garner, were forced to sell their ranch to the Rutledges.  Quint thinks she's pretty, but he assumes she's younger than she is.  He thinks she's in high school.  (He later learns she's legal, and then the sparks fly.)  I won't tell the story, but Empty and Dallas end up working on the ranch with Quint and they all fight the Rutledges together.  Also, I don't know if this is a \\"spoiler\\" or not, but Ms. Dailey has decided NOT to kill off any major characters in this book!  Hallelujah!	2005-06-23
US	51391015	R20U4LC0YB6YX6	0843953993	629423341	Got Fangs?	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	Nice teen book that adults can enjoy, too	I'm a huge fan of Katie Maxwell's \\"Emily\\" series of books, which started with \\"The Year My Life Went Down the Loo.\\"  I highly recommend that book to anyone over 13, by the way.  I knew Katie had written several vampire books under her adult pen name, Katie MacAlister.  Since I'm such a big fan, I decided to give her teen vampire book a shot, even though I have no interest in the whole \\"vampire thing.\\"  I'm glad I did.  I'm an adult, but I still found the book entertaining and a quick read.  Fran is a 16 year-old girl who feels like a freak and doesn't fit in in most crowds.  Her mother, a wiccan, drags her off to Europe as part of a traveling Goth/Psychic Faire.  While there, Fran meets a 300+ year-old vampire, called a \\"Moravian Dark One\\" in the book.  Benedikt, the vampire, is gorgeous and smitten with Fran.  Fran can't decide if she's ready for a boyfriend, much less one that's over 300 years old!  And she definitely doesn't like his macho, overprotective ways.  Their scenes together are the best part of the book, although there's a bit of a mystery to be solved, too.  Katie does a great job describing all the people you would find at a goth faire: the psychics, the wiccans, the magicians, the palm readers, etc.  I actually found it educational, though I wasn't sure what was \\"accepted\\" as common knowledge amongst those who follow that stuff and what she may have made up to make a good story.  Regardless, the story of a teenage girl who feels like a freak is one many can relate to, vampires or not, and a hot hero is a hot hero, right?  The book has a little romance, a little mystery, and an interesting setting.  All in all, it's a nice way to spend an afternoon.	2005-06-03

But I just didn't like this one as much.  The fourth book wasn't quite as good as I had hoped, either.  Emily is eighteen now, and I had hoped she would start acting a bit more mature, but she doesn't seem to have changed much.  She still talks way too much and has terrible impulse control.  The crazy things she did in \\"Loo\\" when she was sixteen were funny then, but I'm growing weary of it.  Sometimes I wonder what a perfect guy like Fang would see in her.  But I guess her babbling and outrageous antics are also part of her charm.<br /><br />I would have liked this book to have more of a story to it, maybe a big adventure or some crisis between Em and Fang (not just the \\"crisis\\" that she can't kiss him on the mouth because he's sick).  I guess I wanted Em and Fang to spend more time together now that they're on the same continent and maybe move to the next level with their relationship.  I know it's a teen book, but there was more \\"action\\" in the earlier books when she was fending off Aidan or planning to sleep with Devon (who, by the way, this book needed much more of).<br /><br />As I said, I don't like saying bad things about Katie's books.  I would rather have a sub-par book about Emily than no more books about Emily, as the author originally intended.  And I am an adult reader, and maybe teens will like this better than I did.  But I was also adult when I read the first three books.  I still like to re-read them occasionally because they were that good.<br /><br />Just some minor stuff:  I don't like the new cover look for the book.  It doesn't really match the book.  Either did the title, for that matter.	2005-05-29
US	51391015	R2GMVPVLXUX159	0060009268	926354235	The Trouble With Valentine's Day	Books	3	6	8	N	Y	Not great, not horrible	I was really looking forward to this book, since I absolutely loved three of Gibson's previous books and liked the other four.  This one falls into the \\"like\\" category-with reservations.  First of all, I agree with other reviewers about the mistakes.  It's ridiculous that the book could make it to the stores with that many errors!  After a while I found myself looking for them just for fun.  But putting the errors aside, I was mostly entertained by the story.  I also agree with the reviewers who question Gibson's idea of a \\"hot\\" leading man.  A fu manchu, a soul patch and a humongous tattoo wouldn't normally do it for me.  I guess I'd have to meet Rob to understand his sexiness.  As is typical in Gibson's and other romances, Rob is a \\"slut.\\"  It's a little hard to work up a good crush on a man who wrecked his marriage by cheating on his wife.  But if you believe he's a changed man, Rob does seem fairly likable now.  He's happy just running his store and fishing in his time off.  Kate is an okay heroine, but nothing about her really makes me like or relate to her.  The romance between her grandfather and Rob's mother was sweet, I guess, but didn't do much for me.  As a reader of all of Gibson's books, the one thing I really enjoyed was the way she mentioned characters from \\"See Jane Score\\" (yummy Luc Martineau) and \\"True Confessions\\" (Sheriff Taber, the Aberdeens, Dixie, etc.).  That made the book just a little more fun.  Overall, though it's not her best work, I'd still recommend this book to friends, especially ones who already like Rachel Gibson.	2005-02-08
US	51391015	R1YO03INMGVK9K	0060590076	300552352	3 & 4: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson (adult)	Books	4	12	12	N	Y	Very entertaining book!	This book is a compilation that contains the third and fourth volumes of the best-selling Georgia Nicolson diaries.  It contains \\"Knocked Out By My Nunga-nungas\\" and \\"Dancing In My Nuddy-pants.\\"  Both those books have Amazon average ratings of 4.5 stars, so that should give you an idea of how good this book is.  Some reviewers rated the first compilation book (containing volumes 1 and 2 of the series) very low because they were confused and thought it contained new stories.  I, for one, like the compilation because I didn't own any books from the series, and it's just more convenient to have one large book instead of two short ones.  This book picks up seamlessly from where \\"On the Bright Side...\\" left off.  The book is written in diary style, so it's very quick and easy to read.  I love the British slang and the quirky expressions the title heroine, Georgia, and her friends use.  They're fourteen and go to a strict religious school (Catholic, I think).  Pretty much all they think and talk about is \\"snogging gorgey lads\\" (don't worry - most of the words you can figure out by context, and the author includes a British-to-American glossary).  The rest of their time is spent thinking up new ways to make the boring school day a little less boring.  The book makes Georgia seem self-centered, and she is, but it is her diary, after all.  Whose diary wouldn't be self-centered?  Plus, she's a teenager, and that's how teenagers act.  Georgia's parents are a continuous source of embarrassment to her.  Her cat, Angus, is part wild, and the little bits the author throws in about him are always amusing.  As is Libby, Georgia's four year-old sister, who insists on sleeping in Georgia's bed, along with a half a dozen hard, pointy toys.  In this compilation Georgia has finally landed her man, Robbie the Sex God, but she can't help thinking about Dave the Laugh.  She even finds herself \\"accidentally\\" snogging him twice!  I'm looking forward to the next volume in the series to see if Georgia matures a bit and realizes which boy is right for her.  I recommend this book for girls over 12, especially Anglophiles.Georgia matures a bit and realizes which boy is right for her.

I, for one, like the convenience, since I planned to buy the whole set.  This book has been rated unfairly by people who were confused.  If you look at the average stars for the two books contained in this edition, you'll see that they average 4.5 stars.  That means people really like the stories.  Now, about the stories.  I love anything having to do with England, so I wanted to read all these Georgia Nicolson books.  I loved reading all the British terms and slang, though it was sometimes hard to tell what was legitimate British slang and what was made up by title heroine, Georgia Nicolson.  One thing I did not like at all, though, was the way Georgia added \\"osity\\" to practically every-other word (i.e. sophisticosity, maturosity).  That was getting on my last nerve.  But there were a lot of laughs in this book for teens and adults alike.  One review I read said Georgia was self-centered.  That's true, but it's that exaggerated self-centeredness that makes it funny.  The way Georgia and her best friend, Jas, talk to each other without really listening to each other is hilarious.  They're both just pretending to listen until they can talk about themselves again.  And Georgia is 14 years old.  All teenagers are a bit self-absorbed.  I look forward to reading the rest of the series and seeing if Georgia matures a bit.  The books are, for the most part, pretty wholesome, and I'd recommend them for girls 12 and up.	2005-02-05

Do that many people appreciate good grammar?  Or is it maybe that they have trouble with grammar and bought this just as a reference guide?  Either way, it's a good thing if it helps improve writing skills in this country.  I bought this book not only as a reference, but to read for fun.  I think the author's clever title greatly helped in getting the word out about this book.  It's mysterious enough to draw people in to see just what the heck it means.  And I must say, I whole-heartedly agree with Truss about people putting an apostrophe in a possessive 'its'-as in \\"the dog chewed it's bone.\\"  That's probably my biggest pet peeve on Earth!  You see it everywhere.  If you like this book, you might also enjoy \\"Woe Is I\\" by Patricia T. O'Conner.	2005-01-31

I chose this book to start because it had some of the best reviews.  I must say I was very pleased.  I liked the way Ms. Aidan expands on the original story without changing the essence.  She just fills in the behind-the-scenes parts we didn't read about in the original.  It's like she made the book three times as long, and the more P&P, the better.  I especially like her imagined version of Darcy's relationship with his valet, Fletcher, and all of Fletcher's machinations to keep Darcy at the height of fashion.  This first book in the 3-part series describes Darcy's meeting Elizabeth Bennet and the whole embarrassing Bennet family.  Of course, the scenes between Darcy and Elizabeth are the heart of Pride and Prejudice.  From what I've read, Elizabeth isn't in the second book at all, so I don't expect to like it as much, but I'll give it a chance.  My only complaints about this book are the typo's and misspellings that simple editing should have prevented.  At one point, the name of Bingley's brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, was spelled \\"Mr. Hearst.\\"  That's just careless editing.	2005-01-23

Since the book comes with the doll, I thought I'd read it just for fun.  I thought it was a pleasant, well-written book.  I think it would especially appeal to girls ages 8-12 who like to dance.  But I think this is also a good book for any child who is forced to move from the home and neighborhood they love and is having a hard time adjusting.  Marisol is a good kid (possibly unrealistically so) who handles her family's move without much whining or complaining to her parents.  She soon learns that the move may not be all bad.  The new neighborhood is definitely quieter, and right next door is a girl in her exact grade who also likes to dance.  The only real worry is that there is no dance studio in her new town, Des Plaines, IL, and Marisol lives to dance.  When Marisol meets her soon-to-be ex-upstairs neighbor's daughter, a dance teacher, she tries to convince her to move to Des Plaines to open a dance studio.  Marisol is a very persistent girl who doesn't take 'no' for an answer.  I like the fact that the book has many Spanish words sprinkled throughout, and there's a small glossary in the back so readers can look up those words.  The book has a slightly educational feel to it, but kids won't even notice it.  They'll just enjoy the story.	2005-01-18

I, too, loved Jack Wagner in the 1980's.  (Actually, I still think he's pretty hot and I love his singing voice.)  But this book just didn't do it for me.  I love a book with a good love story and, ideally, lots of laughs.  Sure, there were some funny parts, but I never really laughed out loud.  I was amused by Eliza's tales of her \\"rock star\\" boyfriends from her high school days.  But there was no real romance in the story.  I thought Andrew was good for Eliza and was rooting for them to get together.  Call me shallow, but I like a nice, happy ending.  There was no closure to this book.  I see most reviewers really liked it, but I give it 2.5 stars and can't really recommend it.	2005-01-15

This is the 7th Rachel Gibson book I've read, and so far, it's in my top three favorites (a toss up with See Jane Score and Daisy's Back).  I'm sad that I only have one Gibson book left to read and then I have to wait for her next one to come out!  This book centers around Delaney and Nick.  They grew up in the small town of Truly, Idaho knowing each other, but never quite friends.  Then one night, just after Delaney's graduation, the two share a passionate encounter.  Circumstances surrounding the encounter cause Delaney to leave Truly for good.  Now, more than ten years later, a death in the family brings Delaney back to Truly.  She can't seem to avoid Nick in the tiny town.  She's unsure of her feelings for him, and she really doesn't know what he thinks about her.  Gibson has said that she thinks women will either love Nick or hate him, and I can see her point.  Personally, I loved him!  He walks a fine line between confident and arrogant, but I like that in a man (if he can back it up!)  As usual, the love scenes are awesome.  Nobody does them better than Rachel Gibson.  The story is hot, hot, hot!  You have to read this!	2004-11-20

This is my fourth one, and it is probably my least favorite so far.  BUT, that doesn't mean it's not very good.  The first two-thirds of the book are especially good while Max and Lola are on the yacht.  This book differs from the others in that it has more action.  That surprised me, but in a good way.  Max is a sexy leading man, even though he's a bit too chauvinistic.  I, like most women, like a strong, take-charge, hero type of man.  Max is all that (and the proverbial bag of chips), but in the beginning of the book he's a little mean to Lola when she unexpectedly gets in his way while escaping the drug lords that are out to kill him.  My other issue with the story is the so-called obstacles that keep them apart, but this is typical of romances like this.  These \\"obstacles\\" never seem that big or real to the readers, just to the poor distressed heroines.  Overall, it's still a really fun read and I recommend it to romance lovers who like a little adventure thrown in.	2004-10-02

I had a chance to page through the Genesis Publications version of this book that sells for about $600, I think, and I had to be careful not to drool on it so they wouldn't make me buy it! That book comes packaged in a replica of a red metal British post office box. The postcards, though fake, look incredibly realistic, as they are glued in like you would glue real postcards into a photo album. They are limited to 2,500 and Ringo signs each one. But since I can buy 35 of these books for less than one of the Genesis versions, I'll stick with this. I was so happy when I found out there was going to be a cheaper version so everyone could enjoy the postcards. I love reading the personal, sometimes silly messages the Beatles wrote to Ringo. Since they were never really intended for public viewing, you get to see the Beatles as just four close, normal friends.  This is evidenced by the way they addressed most of the cards to Richard Starkey, Ringo's real name. I especially like the funny messages and drawings on John Lennon's postcards. This book is a really fun piece of Beatles history, and I am glad Ringo saved all those cards years ago!	2004-09-26

It was just dull, dull, dull.  The main character, 17 year-old Viva, is quirky, but not in a good way.  The book seemed like it should be interesting based on the strange cast of characters in Viva's life, but nothing ever happened!  I didn't like the author's writing style, either.  I found it annoying.  Even though she's only 17 years old, I found myself wishing Viva would just have sex already and get it over with, since the author kept teasing us with the possibility of sex.  Just a very disappointing read.  Save your time for better stuff, like any of Rachel Gibson's books or Bridget Jones's Diary if you've never read that.	2004-09-09

I had to see if and how Emily would finally get her man (Fang, of course!)  I knew early in the first book that Fang was the sweetest guy she'd ever have the good fortune to meet, and I'm glad Emily finally figured that out, too.  I liked that even though Devon wanted to date Emily, he was honest and told her how Fang felt about her.  She sometimes needs help seeing what everyone else sees.  I think every girl needs friends like Devon and Fang.  It's a shame that Devon isn't in England for this whole book, but at least his presence is felt via his steady, supportive e-mails.  Holly and Dru are also around offering advice and unconditional friendship.  Fang is as great as he always was, and if Emily ever decides she doesn't want him anymore, I'll take him!<br /><br />After having just finished some adult books while waiting for this book to be released, I forgot how funny and typical teenager-like Emily is.  I love how she thinks she's so grown up and even likes to counsel her shyer friend Hope about men.  But we the readers see Emily make silly, impulsive decisions that get her into trouble time after time.  This book has Emily working in a less-than-ideal museum job, and the destruction that follows in her wake is amusing, as always.  I think she's done some maturing since she arrived in England, and I can't wait to see how she turns out.  I'm so glad to hear Katie Maxwell has decided to write a fifth book for this series.  I want to see how Emily gets through her senior year and I hope she stays close with all her English friends.  Fans of this series won't be disappointed!	2004-09-03
US	51391015	RW0LRIXNK476I	0380814382	658316423	True Confessions	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Another great Rachel Gibson book!	I really want to give this book 4 1/2 stars, but that's not an option, so I rounded up.  This is my third Rachel Gibson book, and I haven't found a bad one yet.  This book, like the others, has a strong, sexy, gorgeous leading man.  He seems almost too good to be true. (Well, I guess since he's fictional, he isn't true.)  Dylan Taber's an upstanding sheriff, a great lover, and a loving single father.  As usual in Rachel Gibson's books, the love scenes are super hot.  Hope, the female lead, is likable enough, but not perfect.  I sort of felt that she wasn't good enough for Dylan.  Hope's job, writing made-up stories for a gossip-type magazine, seems pretty stupid.  I wondered how she could look down her nose at the sometimes strange residents of Gospel, ID when her job has her making up Bigfoot and alien stories.  The peripheral characters (those strange Gospel residents) are really cool and add humor to the story.  There is one plot point about the deceased former sheriff who inhabited Hope's rented house that I feel was kind of left hanging.  This is my least favorite RG story of the three I've read so far, but I still loved it better than most books.	2004-09-01

This is my second Rachel Gibson book (I read See Jane Score first) and I loved them both so much that I bought all the books she's written.  This book had mixed reviews, so I didn't know what to expect, but I loved it.  My favorite thing about Gibson's books is her love scenes.  They're written more realistically than some other authors (Janet Dailey comes to mind).  And she seems to favor characters in their thirties (at least the two books I read) which is nice.  I liked the premise, that Daisy, Jack, and Steven were best friends growing up and betrayal separated them.  I'm not giving anything away to say that Steven and Daisy's 15 year-old son Nathan is really Jack's.  The book begins with Daisy going to Jack's house to tell him the secret she's kept for all those years.  She's only supposed to be in town for a week, but Jack's bitterness won't allow him to hear her out, so it takes several tries on Daisy's part to talk to him.  The more they interact, the more Jack finds he still can't resist her, even though he doesn't want to want her.  The scenes where they briefly re-unite, almost against their own wills, are so hot!  But when Jack finally learns the truth about Nathan, he's furious.  He feels robbed of all those years he's missed with his son.  Jack is a likable, sexy, strong character, one most women would be attracted to.  He's bitter, but anyone can understand that, considering what his two best friends did to him.  But the reader sees Daisy's point, too, and how scared she must have been to be eighteen, pregnant, and thinking her boyfriend doesn't love her anymore.  The thing that saves Daisy as a character is that she's very remorseful and never tries to defend her actions.  She really wants Jack to get to know his son.  The later part of the book, where Jack and Nathan get to know each other is very sweet.  I really enjoyed this book, and if it's not Gibson's best work, then the others must be pure gold!	2004-08-28

Turns out, it wasn't so great.  The heroine, Maggie, is a life-long dieter who has finally accepted her weight and writes a famous column helping others to do the same.  So her losing weight quickly and even having a cosmetic procedure seemed very unrealistic-even with the great motivation of meeting a gorgeous Hollywood hunk.  Also, the book started too slowly.  I almost gave up on it.  It took about 100 pages for Maggie to finally get to Hollywood to meet the hunk, and then it was a letdown when she got there.  I expected a grand romance, but it was just a fling, although the author did portray the actor as a pretty nice man.  The story's theme of \\"sometimes what you're looking for is right under your nose\\" was kind of sweet, but not enough to make me recommend this book to friends.  Maybe it's just me, but I also didn't like the author's writing style.	2004-08-20

I'm not one who enjoys writing scathing reviews, but as someone who has read all eight of Janet Dailey's Calder books, I feel qualified to review this one.  Each book in this series seems to get worse and worse!  I hope Ms. Dailey checks Amazon to see how her loyal readers feel about her latest books.  Maybe then she'll get back on track.  From what I can tell, most of the reviewers have read the series from the beginning and feel the same way I do.  I loved \\"This Calder Sky\\" so much in '81 when it came out.  And the next couple were good, too.  But the last story I liked even a little bit was \\"Calder Pride\\".  The three since then have been such disappointments.  This book tells the story of Laura Calder, Ty's daughter, Chase's granddaughter.  It's pretty bad when you can't even work up any liking for the heroine, let alone the men she's supposed to be \\"torn\\" between.  Laura is spoiled and shallow.  Although she's said to be beautiful, I had a hard time believing that two men would fall in love with her on the night they meet her.  It appears maybe Boone isn't really in love with her, but he wants her for a trophy wife to satisfy his father.  I did like Sebastian a little, and I actually thought he was too good for Laura.  Dailey continues her alarming trend of killing off beloved characters.  By the next book, Chase will probably have died, since he's suddenly in his 80's.  (Wasn't he about 22 in 1981?)  Although I find it annoying, I do understand the rapid aging of the characters.  They do it on soap operas, too.  It's the only way to keep the stories going.  But, considering how the stories are going downhill so fast, maybe Janet Dailey should just quit while she's behind.	2004-08-16
US	51391015	R1OEOB1K6SAL94	0060009241	418168365	See Jane Score	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Great book!	This was a really fun book.  The main characters, Luc and Jane, are both likable.  At first they seem like an unlikely match, but don't the best love stories always start like that?  Luc is a gorgeous star goalie for the Seattle Chinooks hockey team, and Jane is an introverted journalist hired to travel with the team and get interviews.  Jane is not at all welcomed by the team.  This is especially true of Luc, who has had several bad experiences with the press.  The team decides to give her as little help as possible with her columns, and they try to fluster her by getting naked whenever she approaches them in the locker room.  Predictably, Jane eventually ends up breaking them down and winning their trust and admiration.  But what happens between Jane and Luc is the real story.  Initially, they misjudge each other.  She believes the rumors about his past drug problems and penchant for the ladies and writes him off as arrogant and shallow.  He thinks she's asexual at best, possibly a lesbian, and wonders why she tries so hard to make herself look unattractive.  As they interact more, they find out they have misjudged each other.  Luc is actually a good guy who is trying his best to care for his much-younger, newly-orphaned sister.  Jane has a very sexual side to her, the side of her that secretly writes the Honey Pie sex column for a porn magazine.  Jane finds herself very attracted to Luc but fights it because she wants to be seen as a professional journalist and not have people speculating that she gets her interviews by trading sexual favors.  When she departs from her usual black, shape-hiding clothes for one night and wears a sexy red dress, Luc starts to re-think his former ideas of beauty.  She's short with A-cup breasts, not at all his type, but he can't stop thinking about her.  There's some \\"will they/won't they\\" tension leading up to the very well-written and extremely hot love scenes.  You won't be disappointed with this book.	2004-08-07

I read this book a couple years ago, so I don't remember many specifics, but I remember it being one of the funniest books I've read in my life.  I even forced it on a couple of friends.  They loved it, too.  One of the funniest bits in the book that stands out in my mind is about actuary tables and how people get injured.  Bryson tells how, according to these tables, thousands of people are injured each year by bedding.  And there's a funny bit about the ratio of cup holders to passengers in newer model cars.  I highly recommend this book to anyone with a sense of humor.	2004-07-27

As an adult, I found them both a tiny bit dull, but I think a teenage girl would like this book.  The main character, Chloe, is a self-proclaimed chicken.  She fears anything new and adventurous.  When it is discovered that Chloe is interested in Egyptian culture, her parents decide to send her to Egypt to work as an amateur archaeologist with a group called DigEgypt!  It's a month-long program for teens interested in archaeology to get some hands-on experience.  Chloe's father thinks it will look great on her college applications, but the thought of going makes Chloe sick.  She's afraid of the whole thing, starting with the flight.  Since no one will know her in Egypt, Chloe decides to use the month to re-invent herself.  She's going to be brave and outgoing.  One thing threatens to ruin her plan, though, and that's Connor, an older boy from her school back home.  But Connor is under the mistaken impression that Chloe hangs out with the cool crowd back home, and Chloe lets him think that.  During the dig, Chloe becomes a leader for the other teens.  She even leads a mini-revolt to get them more water for baths and laundry.  Chloe and Connor grow close, and there's some nice teen romance.  The rest of the plot involves an ancient bracelet from the tombs that Chloe can't seem to get rid of.  This is the part of the book that is intertwined with Eyeliner of the Gods, by Katie Maxwell.  In that book, Jan James is having a similar problem with a bracelet.  Chloe thinks Jan is stuck-up because she's on the restoration team, and Jan thinks Chloe is a shallow, lip gloss-obsessed girl.  I recommend reading EOTG first.  When you read each book, you get to know Jan and Chloe more intimately and you find they're both wrong about each other.  I think teenagers would enjoy both books.	2004-07-24

I was a precocious 8th grader then.  Either my tastes have changed, or Janet Dailey is losing her touch.  I thought the last book in the series (Green Calder Grass) was the worst at the time it came out, but this one reaches a new low in dullness.  It's nice that the author has involved patriarch Chase Calder more in this story.  He's the man that hooked us all in the first book.  I guess she had no choice since she killed off Ty Calder in the last book.  That was a crazy move, since he should have lived to become the new Calder patriarch.  But the book's main romance, which Dailey is famous for, is between a mysterious stranger, Laredo, and Ty's widow, Jessie.  I found their relationship rather boring.  There wasn't enough interaction between them to make me really root for them to get together.  Maybe it's because I don't care much about Jessie anymore.  I just find myself wishing Janet Dailey had killed her instead of Ty.  The mystery of who's trying to kill Chase isn't bad, but all in all, the storyline is weak.  I'll probably continue to read any Calder book Dailey puts out because I have so much invested, and I'm a glutton for punishment.  But I think now I'll just get them from the library.	2004-07-15

I was a little disappointed.  This book is better suited for a younger audience, which is, of course, the book's target audience.  But with the \\"Emily\\" series, even an older person like me could enjoy it.  Younger girls might like this one.  I'd have no problem letting my 12 year-old niece read it.  The romance was sweet and very tame.  The characters were likable enough, but I found the story a bit dull. I think Katie does a great job of researching the places where she sets her stories.  The references to Egypt and Egyptian history were nice.  I think maybe I unfairly compared this book to Katie's other Young Adult books: \\"The Year My Life Went Down the Loo,\\" \\"They Wear What Under Their Kilts?\\" and \\"What's French For Eww?\\"  They were tough acts to follow.  I would recommend anyone who hasn't read those to read them first.  Now I'm just looking forward to the last book in that series, \\"The Taming Of the Drew.\\"	2004-07-13

It could have been one gigantic novel if the author had chosen to combine them.  Thank God I discovered them late so I didn't have to wait for this sequel!  This one is as good as the first, maybe even better because it offers resolution to the whole \\"Marcus Flutie situation.\\"  It's great to be able to follow Jessica from just before her 16th birthday to the end of high school.  We get to see her change and grow and eventually become more comfortable in her own skin.  The way Jessica's relationships with her classmates and family change over the three years is so realistic.  And the Marcus Flutie character is so cool and so smart, that I found myself falling for an 18 year-old fictional character--and I'm 36 years old!  This is exactly the kind of book I would have loved back in high school.  I absolutely love it now!  You really need to read \\"Sloppy Firsts\\" first to understand what's going on in this book.  There is a lot of sexual content, so I would recommend it for teens 14 and over, if they're mature.	2004-07-05
US	51391015	R3VJMZJ7BAVP19	0671040510	678008967	This Calder Sky	Books	5	2	2	N	N	An old favorite	I read this book way, way back in 1981 when it was originally released.  (I was in the 8th grade but very precocious!)  I don't remember all the details, but I know I loved it and have read every book about the Calders Janet Dailey has put out since.  This one, the first one, is still the best!  The romance between Chase and Maggie sizzled, and the suspense/adventure part of the book was really good, too.  This book starts a long series of books about the great Calder family, and I recommend reading them all.	2004-07-03

Jessica has deeper thoughts than most of the kids at her school. Her mother describes her as \\"complicated\\".  She's a very mature, super-intelligent girl and a very likable character.  I easily related to her feelings of loneliness and discomfort with her surroundings.  She really can't stand her \\"friends\\" but tolerates them just to keep up the appearance of being normal.  This also helps to keep her mom off her back.  She doesn't understand Jessica because they are just totally different personalities.  On a rare mother-daughter outing, she even tells Jessica that their relationship would be easier if Jessica were less complicated, like her older sister Bethany.  Her dad only talks to her about track, and his pushing sucks all the enjoyment out of it for her.  After Jessica's best friend Hope, the only person in the world who understands her, moves away, she feels like she'll never have a connection like that with anyone again.  She finds one in the strangest of places: a \\"slutty\\", drug-using criminal named Marcus, a fellow student and former friend of Hope's brother.  Their unusual relationship confuses Jessica and leaves the reader hanging on the edge of her seat, dying to start the sequel, Second Helpings.  Although it would be most appreciated by girls, I recommend this book for anyone 14 and older.	2004-07-01

Set in England, this book will appeal to all the Anglophiles out there.  American Tessa Riordan is picked to play a duchess for a month on a reality-type show about life in England in 1879.  Her British duke, Max, is jaw-droppingly handsome, with stunning blue eyes, and he likes Tessa!  Flab and all!  However, his daughter, Melody, is another story.  Tessa has to win her over if she is going to live happily ever after with her duke.  And then there's Max's snobby sister, Barbara, who wants Max to marry another woman.  As the lady of the house, Tessa's main responsibility is to oversee the staff of approximately fifteen servants to ensure things run smoothly in the house.  Keeping them happy proves to be no easy task.  The funny things that happen during the month of filming the show keep the book moving along quickly.  The dialogue is great, and the many love scenes between Max and Tessa are really hot.  This is a lighthearted romance and I recommend it for anyone who likes a little humor with their love stories.	2004-05-23

It's loaded with beautiful color photos.  There are pictures of the actors on the set, the English countryside where the miniseries was set, and scenes taken from the miniseries.  The book gives behind the scenes information on how several of the actors were chosen for their roles and how the locations were chosen.  I especially like the publicity photos of the actors as they look when not in their costumes.  Some are barely recognizable!  It's a great book to have if you love the miniseries as I do.	2004-05-23

Emily is spending a couple weeks in Scotland, ostensibly for a school project, but really in search of hotties in kilts.  This book maybe had even more laugh-out-loud moments than \\"Loo\\". Emily learning the basics of sheep-herding had me laughing hysterically.  Creepy Aidan is out of the picture now, and Emily is competing with her shy friend, Holly, for the attentions of a Schottie (Scottish hottie).  His name is Rory (not the real spelling, but Emily trying to spell it is another highlight of the book).  Her friends Devon and Fang make appearances in this book, too, along with her e-mails from her friend back home, Dru.  This is another great book by Katie Maxwell that any teen girl will love.  I strongly recommend you read the first book, \\"The Year My Life Went Down the Loo\\" first.	2004-05-10

Books	4	10	11	N	Y	Katie's books are always great	I'm another adult fan of Katie's \\"Emily\\" series, and I thought this was a great book.  The use of Paris as the setting was really fun, especially Emily's massacring of the French language.  My favorite part of the book was Emily's \\"son\\" Jack, the pregnancy-prevention doll she was forced to lug around Paris.  I missed Emily's interaction with her family, especially her father Brother.  I can't wait for her to get back to England.  I didn't like this book quite as much as the first two in the series, but Katie's worst book is better than most other authors' best.  Maybe I just liked it less because I know Emily was meant to be with Fang, and he wasn't in this book at all.  But I can be patient until the next book where I'm sure Katie will wrap things up nicely.	2004-05-10

I am an adult who stumbled on this book while looking for a book for my 10 year-old neice.  While it is definitely too mature for her, I absolutely loved it!  I like the way the book is composed of e-mails from Emily describing her exploits with her new friends in England to her friend, Dru, back in the States.  The made-up \\"Emily\\" words sound like the way two teenage best girlfriends talk to each other.  Being an Anglophile myself, I loved reading about Emily learning and using the local slang.  Although Emily thinks going to England for a year is the worst possible thing that could happen to her, the three boys she meets there make things interesting.  One boy, Fang, is a sweet guy that Emily likes as a friend, but doesn't quite see as the one who really cares about her.  I like Emily's father, who is really a pretty cool guy, although Emily thinks he's ancient and a constant source of embarrassment to her.  I'd say this book would appeal to any teen girl 14 or older, or even younger if they're precocious like I was at that age.	2004-05-10
