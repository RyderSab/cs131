Williams did an excellent job of juggling multiple plot lines and developing his characters.  The first book in the series moved a little slowly while he introduces all of his elements but once you get through it the final three were quite enjoyable.  I eagerly followed the adventures in the virtual world and was always excited to see what the next world would be when they crossed through a portal and were transported to a new land.  A lot of creative thought was put into the writing (I enjoyed the Oz land....a very wry twist on what COULD have gone wrong in that realm).  All that being said I was somewhat disapointed with the ending.  After all, again, reading all four book was quite an investment of time and I felt that Williams did a few to many cliffhangers (Dread's final victims, Renee's father and company to name a few) that were resolved by basically saying &quot;and then they were rescued&quot;.  After 4,000+ pages he could have spent the time to elaborate on these story lines and completed them in a much more satasifactory manner. All in all, though, a good read and I would recommend it.	2004-04-27

This book had its funny moments - Mainly at the beginning. However, the further one reads the clearer it becomes that the same 3 jokes are being repeated over and over and over again.  She drinks...A lot! She worries about not having sex...a lot!  She abuses and takes advantage of everyone around her.... a lot! What I had hoped would be a quick and fun read quickly turns to tedium.  I would suggest buying this book for a flight that is going to take several hours ...but once you're done with the flight you should know that there is no point in reading any further..you've gotten some laughs and really have covered every aspect of the character that you're going to learn..even if you do sludge through the rest of the story.	2003-08-03

The tale of how Pi survives his ordeal at sea (and his living arrangements with the tiger) is completly engrossing.  Martel's prose is excellent and flows seamlisley.  I enjoyed the juxtaposition of Pi's religous beliefs wuithin various passages throughout the book.  It's definitley a read that could soon be considered a classic!	2003-07-23

HOWEVER, if the reader can put himself in the mindset of pre-civil war America this is a great multi-level story.  Obviously many reviewers are going to talk about the theme of slavery contained in the book.  I think Samuel Clemens did a fantastic job of portraying his disdain for it.  Blacks were considered almost below animals at the time.  Consider the portion of the book where Huck is spinning a tale to Tom Sawyer's Aunt Sally and says that his boat was delayed becasue of an engine explosion.  When she asks if anyone was hurt, he replies that a \\"nigger was killed\\" to which she responds \\"Well that's good, since sometimes people do get hurt\\" and then goes on to relate a tale of a white engineer that was killed in a similar accident.  She didn't think about her response.  This was simply the automatic reaction of southern slaveholders of the time.  In this environment, in this society for Huck to grow to realize that Jim is a true. loving caring human being is amazing and the heart of the story as far as I'm concerned.  Set aside any preconceptions that you may have about the book and give it a try!	2002-03-01
US	52757332	R5XOA0SJSO7F7	0743211383	241269653	Dreamcatcher	Books	2	1	3	N	N	A Fall From Grace	Don't know WHAT the Amazon.com reviewer read but this is a book to lament, not for fans to rejoice over!  King (as we all know) is a fantastic writer but somehow when he tries to delve into science fiction/invaders from outer space he simply falls flat on his face.  Tommyknockers was my least favorite novel of his - but now this one is a tight contentder for that designation.  The first half of the book just drug on terribly between jumping between characters and flashbacks -- I really kept losing interest and having to walk away and at times forcing myself to go back to it hoping it would pick up.  From reading all the advance reviews I think everyone knows about the &quot;implants&quot; but it takes almost 300 pages before the aliens even make their first appearance!  For me, the second half involivng the military pursuit of the alien inhabited character was the best part.  That was when some of the old King suspense shone through  (although you never had ANY doubt about what the end result was going to be -- unfortunately predictable in that area) Finally, don't pick up this book, as others seem to have, thinking it is some sort of sequel to &quot;IT&quot; or even the clown.  Except for a VERY fleeting reference to child disapparences in Derry during one of the flashbacks you won't find any more talk of that story.  Final thought....PLEASE don't let there be a sequel to THIS book as was alluded to in the end of the story.  If so, it would be the very first King book that I would decide not to spend money on.	2001-06-10

The characters are fairly well developed and the action is well paced.  I especially liked the chapter of &quot;snapshots&quot; of what happened when the comet hit and the italized asides throughout the book that described geographical and political results of the impact.  These details are what draws one into the story and helps you visualize the magnitude and scope of such a disaster.  (While not profound, I first read this book when I was in high school and one of the images that had stuck in my mind for over 20 years was that of Gil trying to ride out the tidal wave that hit Los Angeles.)  In fact it was that tease of a memory that made me look in the bookstores for Lucifer's Hammer so I could re-read it again.  I would have rated the book 5 stars exept for the last 3 pages.  It really feels like after building up to a climax that Niven and Pournelle had never really agreed on who was going to write the conclusion.....and the book ends quite abruptly with a  really unsatisfactory summary.  I would have preferred that they added an additional 50 pages to flesh out was what discussed in these 3 pages (......maybe some year a sequel?)  All in all, despite my personal complaint about the ending, a good read that I would highly recommend.	2001-01-24

Generally, I greatly admire her story telling - but have to admit that &quot;The Fresco&quot; really goes nowhere.  While I wouldn't portray her as shrill, I would say that this novel does go a bit over the top with friendly aliens appearing and solving all the world's problems for us by forcing everyone to be openminded.  I think this could have been a much better novel if it had focused on The Fresco itself and the fact that once it is uncovered it represented something totally different than the aliens believed and how that affected their society.  I definitely will continue to read Tepper's novels but doubt I would ever recommend this particular one to friends.	2001-01-16

Long ago, he seemed to have fallen into ultra-trite, repetitive formulas.  Christopher Snow and his buddies are SO goody-goody that I was practically  rooting for the monkeys (don't ask).  I mean come on, Sasha plays the  synthezier, acoustic and electric guitar, sax, piano, composes original  scores , is a gourmet cook, maintains an elaborate indoor herb garden,  holds a fulltime radio job in addition to being general manager of the  station, and yet still manages to have a loving and deeply meaningful  relationship with someone who can't be exposed to any sort of direct light?  (plus being so good - luckily - with a gun)  I felt guilty just wasting the  time sitting in my dusty living room reading the book!  Koontz also has  decided he needs to impress us with his elaborate knowledge of surf lingo.   Guess what...don't care.  Orson was an annoying, too cutsey addition.   Koontz has hammered super-intelligent animals to death in several books.   He's also hammered to death Moonlight Cove being ground zero in genetic  manipulation gone awry.  What is this....the third book that he has  subjected this particular population to some sort of de-evolution?  Is  there anyone even remotely human remaining in this city?  Ultimately the  book fizzles to a very unsatisfactory ending with no climax.  It is so  boring that I have no desire to pick up the sequel if one ever is printed.	2000-06-19

It was way too much.. &quot; and then the battle was over&quot;   As another reviewer mentioned, when I got down to 75 pages I realized that  Stirling was going to cheat and rush the climax.  Although it is blatently  obvious that another book (or even trilogy) is potentially in the works,  don't think I'll bother.  (Could Marian really survive another war?)	2000-06-04

THE SPARROW was an incredible book that deserved to be written and read.  This one doesn't match up at all.  I found the Sandoz character's quandries to be extremely  redundant from the first book and rather boring (we've HEARD all of it  already).  The developments on Rakhat were interesting but really could  have been included in the first book as a condensed couple of additional  chapters.

But the thought that I'm having as I write this is &quot;I'd love to meet this woman sometime&quot;.  I didn't feel that this was &quot;hypercomplicated&quot; or  &quot;confused&quot; at all. Tepper's plots are always intriguing and  thought provoking.  I really liked the addition of Coyote and Bear and the  rest of their clan.

This collection is interesting for the &quot;historical&quot; sense that it was her first effort.  At a minimum,  all one can say, is that she came out of the gate with a bang with her  writing career.  Note:  I was almost put off by the  &quot;professional&quot; reviewers that talk about this collection  anticipating the Dungeon and Dragons craze because I then thought that the  books would be focusing on &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; somehow.  The  only similarity is that in Tepper's lands some people have different types  of Talents (firestarting, mindreading, shapeshifting, to name a few) and  the people with these talents can band together and battle (or as the book  describes it &quot;call game&quot; with one another).  So with that  knowledge you can say these books don't anticipate D&amp;D anymore or less  than Tolkein did.   The story line is a little more staight forward and  with a smaller cast of characters than in some of her more recent books  which makes it an easier read in that sense.  But don't worry, if you are a  long time Tepper fan, it is not all lite  - there are still the good ol  Tepper philosphical questions wound into the story that makes us enjoy her  so much.  With all that said, I think this collection is better than  &quot;standard&quot;.  It's GREAT.  Wizards and mindreaders, dragons, and  &quot;magical&quot; talents galore.  If you enjoy fantasy stories you'll  enjoy this.  If you have never read her, this is a great series to get  introduced by (even though all of her books are great to be introduced to  her by).	1999-12-14

I understand that EARTH ABIDES was written in the forties, but the stilted style of  writing used and the attitudes and world view of Stewart's main characters  are so jarringly anchronistic that I could never forget I was reading a  book --- it never transported me into the world that the writer was trying  to create.  The italized asides within the chapter explaining what was  happening elsewhere (i.e., lice, cats, ants, etc.) were interesting but not  enough to save the book as a whole.  LUCIFER'S HAMMER, WAR DAY, or THE  STAND are all much better &quot;end of the world&quot; type books	1999-12-06

I love King's new style but reading this reminded me why I got hooked on him in the first place.  A combination of fear of the dark and the knowledge  that (despite Hollywood's protestations to the contrary)good does not  automatically vanquish evil in all cases and ANYTHING can happen to  characters you care about in King's world. A great scary read that I would  recommend to anyone who loves vampire stories.	1999-12-03

The book goes in for far to strong an explanation of the church's heirarchy and  various functions, history, and traditions and the story the novel is  supposed to be about gets definite short shrift with a very unsatisfactory,  rushed, and cliched ending.  Note that I have nothing against the Mormon  faith itself and actually quite enjoyed FOLK OF THE FRINGE which also had a  strong Mormon content.  All in all, LOST BOYS is a huge disapointment due  to false billing.  One of the very few books I have ever thrown away.	1999-11-23

I think Phantoms, Whispers, House of Thunder, and Intensity are among his best.  BUT the other extreme are his characters that are super-perfect and overcome such odds that it  left me rolling my eyes in exasperation.  Also the ending greatly  disapointed me.  &quot;Was&quot; he or &quot;Wasn't&quot; he?  There is no  closure.  Don't waste your time!  Along with 'The Mask' one of Koontz's  worst ever.	1999-11-22

This book (combo of two volumes) definitly has a plentitude (?) of twists, plotting, romance, and details.  Once started I didn't want to put it  down....HOWEVER, while you learn a LOT about the Thraish, the Talkers, and  the Trecci...it is rather annoying that more detail and attention was not  given in developing the Strangeys, their contribution to life on the  planet, and the conclusion of the Lila substory.  In some ways it feels  like the needed explanations were cut out in the editing and unfortunately,  the result left me feeling that there is a fairly large hole in the narrat  sligtly wanting.  Ultimately it was hard for me to give an rating - I think  3 and a half stars really more accurately reflects my feelings.	1999-11-05

I converted to Catholicism a few years ago  and feel that this book definitely helps me understand the roots that Christianity grew from.   Unlike Isaac Asimov's Guide to the Old Testament which focuses more on the  physical placement and names of tribes, lands, and battles, Mr. Cahill  explores the psychological development of a people and their view of the  universe and their lives.  Humorus descriptions (Sodom and the Night of the  Living Dead for example)are enjoyable and don't detract from his narrative.   At the end, one realizes that the gifts that were given us were indeed  immense and affect us every day.  I highly recommend this book, no matter  what your beliefs are, it can be enjoyed by all.	1999-09-29

I found Reichs style of writing to be far more enjoyable than  Cornwell and Temperence to be a more believable character than Kay  Scarpetta. Also, Harry is a more enjoyable and interesting secondary  character than Scarpetta's daughter.  The story had twists and surprise  connections/revelations at the end.

I finished it in the first couple of days.  I have not read much &quot;alternative history&quot; but this book has whetted my appetite for  more.  I thought the author handled the question of how the island realized  they were affecting the future with their very existence was well handled.   What are these people supposed to deal --sit there, eat nothing, and starve  to death?....that is unrealistic.  As at some point the book notes the fact  that the charecters continue to exist proves that life goes on.  I  speculated in my mind of how &quot;our&quot; presenct would be like if this  event had actually happened and civilization had gotten such s jump start.   For the reviewers who don't like the lesbian captain....GROW UP.  Gay men  and women are and have always been here.  We are just as &quot;normal&quot;  as you and can be just as &quot;emotionally screwed&quot; up as straights.   It was a delight to read a book with such a positive gay character.  Thumbs  up to the author.

I was a third of the way through this book and mentioned to my roommate that I wondered if the people who had made the Blair Witch Project had read the book.  I love King's older stuff and I loved this book, too.  He proves  that you don't have to have goblin's and deamons jumping out and drinking  human blood every other page in order to ratchet up the reader's fear.  Patricia's desperation and degeneration as the days of her trek continue  were very believeable and very frightening. The one thing I didn't  particulary like was the &quot;God of the Lost&quot;.  It felt as though he  just through this supernatural element in as a bone to all those people he  knew were going to be whining because it wasn't another &quot;Salem's  Lot&quot;.

I found the description  of  re-decent into legalized slavery and company towns, all with federal  and local blessings very frightening. I agree with a previous reviewer that  the Earthseed religion did not add all that much to the story,  but taking  it as a story of human preserverence over chaos and evil, it was a great  read.  I highly recommend it.	1998-12-27
