The writing (and editing) weren't really that great, but I was expecting a bit more substance.<br /><br />The author gave an overview of mercenary operations over an extended period of history and then gave relatively short shrift to current operations, particulalry in Iraq, where PMC's (Private Military Companies) are making sinful amounts of money out of the ongoing debacle in Iraq.<br /><br />The author doesn't appear to have an agenda with this book, other than to get published and make money the sad thing is that with a little more homework and fact checking, he could have done something special.	2005-07-18

Urban does fine work here.<br /><br />Like many other reviewers, I have come to this work by way of several different fiction series' about the Napoleonic period.  My particular interests in the famed Riflemen of the 95th comes directly from my exposure to Cornwell's \\"Richard Sharpe\\" novels.<br /><br />My wife gave this book to me as a Christmas gift, and amply demonstrated just one of the many reasons I love her so much.<br /><br />This book was a great read!  Plain and simple.  It has it all... cowardice, humor, bravery under fire, soldierly comradeship, human failings, honorable (and despicable) behavior, and plenty of action.  Best of all, it's all true!<br /><br />If you have an interst in the period, particularly about the penninsular campaign, you will be doing yourself a favor by reading this book.	2005-03-30

The Japanese take Hawaii... ok, but with only one division?<br /><br />I realize that American airpower was not a factor after the opening of the campaign, but air superiority or no, The available American forces should have been able to better than that.  Alright, I understand the suspension of disbelief, so I'll move on.<br /><br />I just don't see that this series, for I am certain that there will be more, is going to do it for me.

It seems to me that Turtledove has left the door open for another book in this series... something that I fervently hope that he doesn't do<br /><br />This book was dull.  I wish I could say something better about it.  I only gave it three stars because of past work by the author, and because we were finally wrapping up a nice string of novels.<br /><br />Harry, please do better next time.	2005-03-30

It was different, exciting in most places, and fun to read.<br /><br />I think that Stirling has a great imagination and, if the previous reviews indicate anything, he makes the reader think.<br /><br />Many previous reviewers have strong opinions, of one sort or another, about the morality of the scenario/author/characters, but it should be remembered that this is a story.  Did you hear what I said?  A story.  It isn't about the author's opinions or his politics.<br /><br />Having said that, I will say that Stirling has never let me down, and I enjoy his work immensely.<br /><br />Well done!	2005-03-30

In the 16 years since, I have read it four more times.  This book isn't literature, and it isn't high art, but it is damned good.<br /><br />Grimwood tells a tight story, with just a few central characters... he isn't trying to paint broad vistas, so don't expect that.  The story is at times romantic, and at times rather grim, but it is entertaining throughout.<br /><br />When you get right down to it, this is a story about the self-examined life... wouldn't we all like to experience just a little of what Pamela and Jeff did?  To be able to do some things different in our lives, or at least re-enjoy the special things from our old memories?<br /><br />If you are looking for hard science fiction, this isn't it, but I think that if you have the slightest bit of wonder in you, you will enjoy this book.	2004-12-02

Despite the opening of the book, I settled in to enjoy it.<br /><br />Birmingham seems to have been successful at, what I am certain is, the intentional tail-twisting of some American conservatives by naming a ship after the fictional President H. Clinton, but that isn't the sum of this book's parts.<br /><br />Like many, I didn't care for the language of some of the female characters... but, this is a novel, so I took it for what it was worth.<br /><br />I think his one big glaring flaw comes from his lack of study done about the U.S. Marine Corps.  There are no Doctors in the Corps... medical personnel are supplied by the navy.  Naturally, as a USMC veteran, I would notice that.  The author, being Australian, is completely forgiven.<br /><br />Birmingham tells a story that is fun to read, and will be enjoyed by people who are fans of the genre.  As a military fiction fan, I would have enjoyed more detailed descriptions for the weapons, but hey, you can't have everything.<br /><br />This book is fun to read.  Don't take things too seriously and enjoy yourself with it.	2004-11-27

The authors talk about the game and equipment in terms that someone with no prior knowledge can easily digest.  They resist the over-usage of jargon and where they do use jargon, they explain what they are talking about in a way that doesn't leave the reader sitting there scratching his/her head.<br /><br />I plan to continue my exploration of the world of Rugby, and Rugby For Dummies has become my chief reference.<br /><br />Kudos to the authors!	2004-09-13

I won't rehash the story... if you are reading this, you have seen enough of that already from other reviewers.  What I will tell you, is that Judson has given us a \\"future history\\" unlike any most of us have ever seen.<br /><br />The scope of the story is wide without being to wide to take it all in.  The characters are developed well enough to see the things that drive them.  The descriptions of wholesale slaughter in battle are done well enough to make you nearly feel as if you were there, without getting wrapped up in techno-war speak or gratuitous desriptions.<br /><br />The main characters, of Fitz, Buck, Hood, and Robert are well done, and I hope that Judson will again, someday give us a glimpse into the world of the Yukon Confederacy.<br /><br />Full marks!	2004-09-06

Further, she doesn't shrink from taking stab at today's almost-useless civil rights leaders.<br /><br />It is time, and past time for us to be proud of who we are for what we are and what we have done in this country.  Not because white people will acknowledge it... some will, some won't, but so what?  The acknowledgement of others shouldn't be the goal of ethnic pride.  That said, it should also be said that ethnic pride shouldn't be a bar to the pride that comes from being an American.<br /><br />It is time, and past time for us to stop seeing ourselves only in comparison to how we are treated by white people... or any other people, including other black people.  Black Americans have done remarkable things.  We are inseparably woven into the fabric of American history and society.<br /><br />It is time, and past time for us to stop pretending that we exist outside of American society.  We don't.  This is our country, we are full citizens... let's act like it.  We should walk tall, be proud, look others in the eye and smile, or not..., but not because of hostility, but because we are sure of ourselves and our great role in the building, and the success of this country.  We ought not wait for the approval of other people to feel good about ourselves.  This is childish behavior.<br /><br />This book could have been written better, and I don't agree with every word that is printed here, but what Dickerson wrote needed to be said.<br /><br />Dickerson is right... the mind truly is the last plantation, and all we need do is walk out through the open gate and decide to opt in.	2004-02-11

President Carter deserves credit for doing a novel about the southern theater of war during the American Revolution.  It is time and past time that we delve into that region during this period, which is generally ignored or glossed over in our schools.<br />The characters in this book aren't developed terribly well, and the writing seems labored at points, but since this is Carter's first novel he can be forgiven for that.<br />I enjoyed it, and although I only gave it three stars I would recommend this novel... especially to anyone who has an interest in that particular part of our national history.	2004-02-11

He illustrates the unfortunate fact that politicians aren't the only people that practice the arcane, dark art of politics, but that our military leaders did it (and still do it) every bit as much.<br />Reading about Ken McCoy and the others is a comfort, to be sure.  It is sort of like a visit from old friends, but I would like to see some of the supporting characters fleshed out a bit more.<br />Having made the criticism above, I will end by saying that despite a few very minor things, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone.	2004-01-12

If I could give this book 10 stars, I would gladly do so.  Dr Slade has hit a historical homerun with this well-told tale of the birth of our republic.<br />Told from the viewpoints of Benjamin York, a pressed British seaman that deserts in 1775 Boston, and Genevieve, the Massachussetts farm girl he marries, this story takes us from the beginning of our war of independence at Lexington &amp; Concord, to it's end at the Battle of Yorktown.<br />Not only does Slade tell the story well, he does something that will truly shock some people:  He teaches you as well!  This is no dry historical tome that will send you off to sleep after the first few pages.  No, indeed.  When you put this book down, you will have a real feeling and understanding about the American Revoultion that so few people ever get.<br />When you read this book, Breed's Hill and Bunker's Hill will become real places and real battles, not just dry factoids from high school.  Not only will you see the battles as real, but the pople as well.  From the hunger of the foot soldier, to the real moral and tactical dilemma's facing the various commanders.<br />Slade makes people like George Washington, and Nathaniel Greene real flesh-and-blood men, not the cardboard heroes we often read about.  The fact that he makes them human makes them all the more heroic.<br />Another point in Slade's favor is that he doesn't fail to discuss the southern theater of operations. Many Americans don't realize that some of the bloodiest fighting of the war took place in the Carolinas, and that the most militarily significant battle of the war was that of Guilford Courthouse, in North Carolina.<br />Slade has done nothing short of brilliant work here.<br />Buy this book.  You won't be disappointed.	2003-08-14

I found Mr Blanchard's book to read more like a political treatise than a manual for responsible gun ownership. Indeed, I found the book to be more of an NRA recruiting pamphlet than anything else. In his book, Blanchard makes some inflammatory statements about race and religion that he puts forth as fact, when indeed they are opinions.<br />Advocating that gun ownership is fine and good is one thing (and I agree with it).

I enjoyed this book a great deal, particularly because he was a bit less preachy in this one than he was in his first.<br />The main character, Mitch Rapp, is rather enigmatic, but then looking at what he does for a living, that would be appropriate.  The characters were good, the scenery was described well, and this time Mr Flynn didn't make everyone that was a non-conservative, a cross between the devil and a child molester.<br />Mr Flynn does a good job with the local geography as well.  Many authors tend to make things up as they go along when describing Washington, DC (Clancy comes to mind here), but Flynn gets it all down just right.  From George Washington University Hospital (where my daughter was born) and campus, to the State Department and Naval Bureau of Medicine on 23rd street that I drive past every morning and afternoon<br />This isn't high art, and it isn't literature, but if you are looking for a fast paced novel about political intrigue, assassins, and tradecraft this is your book.<br />As a personal aside, I think Mitch Rapp should ditch that Beretta he uses and get something a bit more practical for his line of work.	2001-06-25

It was awful.	2001-06-25

The author does a nice job of wrapping up the series while setting us up for another series at the same time.  This trilogy was well worth the read, and I plan to read it again.  If you are a fan of military science fiction, Mr Douglas will not disappoint you.	2001-02-16

Avenging the loss of his Battalion's colours, Richard Sharpe and his trusted friend Sergeant Patrick Harper, set out to capture a French battle standard... an Eagle.<br />In Sharpe's Eagle, Cornwell again gives us the detail, and the fearsome exhilaration and confusion of personal combat and brings it to life.  As with Sharpe's Rifles, I couldn't put this one down.  As soon as I read it, I had to go to the library and get the next one.	2001-02-06

I finally picked up &quot;Sharpe's Rifles&quot; months after having the series recommended to me by a friend.  I wish I hadn't waited.  Although I read a lot of military fiction, I have never read anything about the Napoleonic wars.  Cornwell actually brings the battles to life, from the cries of the dying and wounded to the smell of the smoke of the battlefield.  All of the cahracters come to life, and are exemplary of the kind of lives lived by the soldiers and officers of the era.  It is obvious that Cornwell did his homework here.<br />Richard Sharpe is a well developed character, an everyman that developed not only into a super warrior, but also into a superb leader of warriors.<br />In this novel the author gets right down to the story, and wastes no time getting to the heart of the story.  The writing is straightforward and clean.<br />Highly recommended	2001-02-06

I realize that you have to suspend belief to a certain degree to enjoy technothrillers, but this is quite a stretch.  The reason that the best technothirllers are so good, is because they have some degree of believability.  This story just didn't have that.  Many other reviewers have made the same comments that I would make, so I won't repeat them.<br />I hope Harry's next offering is better	2001-02-05

I enjoyed the story well enough, but what really caught my attention is that Cornwell told such a detailed story of the assault at Paoli's Tavern and the Battle of Germantown, that I could practically smell the smoke of the cannon and hear the rattle of musketry. It was also nice to read a story about the American Revolution told from a different perspective.<br />Cornwell deserves full marks for this effort. If half of what I hear about the &quot;Sharpe's&quot; series is true, I am in for quite a treat.	2001-01-09

Coupled with the inclusion of wonderful photography and maps, this book leaves the reader with a full grasp of what the pleasant Prince and his various protectors, guides and benefactors went through during his five months as a fugitive in the Scottish countryside.<br />The authors also gave great detail, without undue romanticism,  of young Flora MacDonald's role in the Prince's escape.<br />People interested in the history of Great Britain in general, and Scottish history in particular will greatly enjoy this book.	2000-10-23

Moore's work does something extremely important for the student of early American history. He de-mythologizes the beginnings of the American Revolution, and sheds new light on the people that most Americans were taught to view as villains, those who remained loyal to King George III.<br />Moore not only describes the revolution from the perspective of those those that remained loyal to their King and country, he also details some of the less than democratic ways our forebears treated them.<br />I highly recommend this book to all who are interested in a more even handed study of the period than the highly propagandized version we usually get here.	2000-10-18

The story is good, and we don't find out &quot;whodunit&quot; until the very end.  My only complaint is that the characters were a bit cliche.  Dr. Melanie Anderson was just about the angriest character I have ever seen.  In my own humble opinion, I don't see how she could possibly have risen to a position of responsibility within the CDC with some of the know-nothing convictions she holds. Agent Cavanaugh is the quintessential &quot;man afraid of commitment&quot;<br />Read this book and be entertained for a few hours.	2000-10-11

I had hoped that after the disaster that was \\"Rainbow Six\\" you would have made a little more effort this time around.<br />* You have turned your main character, Jack Ryan, into a know-nothing Buchananite Libertarian that has nothing for disdain for the people that serve their country by working in government (except for soldiers and cops). Not to mention that he swears entirely too much.<br />* You have shown an apalling lack of attention to detail regarding the geography of the DC area, which is a shame as you live so nearby. NOTE: A north-bound ship, heading for the Washington Navy Yard needn't pass under the John Phillip Sousa bridge... You meant the South Capitol Street bridge... which isn't a drawbridge.<br />* Your plots are thinner and thinner.<br />* Your addition of gratuitous sex scenes is an indicator of a lack of imagination or immaturity<br />* Your combat scenes are ludicrous<br />* Your overuse of Secret Service codenames was silly.<br />* People (even us awful slackers in government) rarely refer to the President as POTUS, and even more rarely do they refer to the First Lady as FLOTUS.<br />In closing, your work was overwrought, over-written, and just plain ol' poor. It is obvious that you didn't do much research for this novel, and that you REALLY do need to reunite with Larry Bond. [...]	2000-09-05

I bought this book at lunch time yesterday, anxious to see what Clancy has  been up to since the release of Rainbow Six.  Naturally I don't know what  he has been up to, but it hasn't been paying attention to deatil.  Pardon  me for nitpicking, but I feel that I must.  <br />In the first chapter, Clancy  refers to a character as a National Intelligence Officer.  In beltwayspeak,  this person would be referred to as a NIO (rhymes with Geo).  A NIO is an  intelligence officer that gathers collected intelligence data and prepares,  then delivers daily intelligence summaries for The President.  He goes on  to describe this NIO as being at CIA HQ in Langley, Virginia, preparing a  briefing, then DRIVING (during the DC rush hour!) to the White House and  going to his office.  On the next page, this NIO is revealed to be the  National Security Advisor. Again, this may be overly picky, but please!   The National Security Advisor to the President of The United States doesn't  drive to CIA HQ, then drive to the White House.  Further, the National  Security Advisor doesn't normally present the daily intelligence  summary<br />For someone as clued in as Clancy was always purported to be,  this seems quite shoddy.  One wonders if all of his good ideas went out the  window when Larry Bond went off to write on his own.<br />I'll have more when  I am finished	2000-08-22
US	50390375	R3VOWLS5L0P96P	0671023187	590280047	Term Limits	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Decent first offering	I am glad that I read Flynn's second novel first, because this one was certainly not as good.  Mr Flynn makes a fine entry into the genre with this piece of work but could have really used some better editing.  I  realize I may be nitpicking a bit but Mr Flynn has nearly every major  character in this boook, all educated people, using some fractured  english.<br />Further, Mr Flynn repeatedly (as many as 5 times on a single  page) referred to American military personnel as \\"commandos\\".  With the greatest respect to the author, I must say that  \\"commando\\" is a word seldom, if ever, used in the American  miliary lexicon.  Special Forces personnel are usually referred to just  that way, or as \\"special operators\\" or \\"spec-ops\\"  etc...<br />His main character, Michael O'Rourke, fits the typical description  of today's so-called \\"angry white male\\"... He is a 32 year old member of  the House of Representatives who lives in Georgetown (an area of Washington, DC that is home to some of it's wealthiest citizens) and carries around a .45 caliber pistol in fear of  \\"roving youth gangs\\"  (Mr Flynn  must be writing about a different Georgetown than the one a five minute  drive from my office).  O'Rourke actually advocates the murder of politicians that are no good (I wonder why this novel didn't have a Strom Thurmond or Jesse Helms counterpart).  No wonder this book is so well reviewed by so many self-described Rpublicans and Conservatives.<br />I realize that this was his first time out of the gate, but I would suggest to Mr Flynn that not all of the people in the world are not either Irish, Swedish, or from Minnesota.<br />This book was a good read, but incredibly  preachy.  Read it, you may have some fun.	2000-06-08

In a genre that almost never fails to typify &quot;operators&quot; as blood lusting Rambo-types, Mr Flynn has  taken the right path with Mitch Rapp.  No undue  gunplay.  No gratuitous sex scenes. Not too much hokey dialogue.<br />I look  forward to FFlynn's next offering.	2000-06-01

Even the unlikely separate peace with the Soviets was an interesting take.<br />The problem with this book is in the  writing.  The authors are proffessional game designers which, I am sure  helped in working out the fictional tactics and strategies used by the  combatants, but, they should have employed a writer to at least help them  with their style and substance.  I found the characters to be flat and in  some cases cartoonish.  The authors use of German was poor at best, ham  fisted at worst.<br />Read this book if you have a few hours to kill, but if  you have anything better to do, like trim your toenails, take a pass.	2000-06-01

Once again Stirling shows that he ranks right alongside Turtledove in the alternate history genre.  If you are reading this you probably already read the book, but if you haven't, stop reading this and go out and get it.  No  need for me to synopsize, as that has already been done, but I must say  that Stirling knows how to write a combat scene and shows, throughout the  series, that he knows a great deal about the brotherhood of arms.  Further,  Stirling seems to know from whence he speaks regarding firearms... The fact  that the armed forces of The Repubic of Nantucket are using copies of the  Colt Python as their standard sidearm speaks well for Stirling, as the  Python is the finest revolver ever produced.  I look forward to the next  installment.	2000-05-19

He slowed the pace a bit for character development which is always a good thing.  Concerning the political/military situation  in the world, Turtledove has set up some scenarios that touch enough modern  issues (such as middle eastern tensions) to interest readers that don't  have a particular interest in history from the WW2 era and its aftermath,  as well as many things that will speak forcefully to anyone that has a  great interest in that time period as well.<br />I heartily disagree with  one of the reviewers that suggested that the America depicted in this book  is a happier place than the one we know from OTL (our time line).  The  America depicted here seems to be tottering on the edge of becoming a  police state... then again, there are many Americans that wouldn't seem to  mind this.<br />I look forward to the next installment with great  anticipation.<br />So nice to hear from Stirling.	2000-04-04
