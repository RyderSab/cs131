I have read all of Anne's vampire books and have, for the most part, loved each one in it's own right.  This, however, is such a departure in writing style, story-line and intensity, that I am shocked it was written by the same woman who brought us timeless stories of other vampires.  Lestat seems to be written like an 18 year old surfer, using the word &quot;dude&quot; too many times for me to count.  Mona is detached and cold.  Quinn is a stumbling fool.  This book lacks Lestat's charm, it also lacks Louis, Marius, Armand, Pandora and every other entertaing character she has previously brought to life.  I am sad this is her last chronicle.  I am more sad that this is how the chronicle ended, which such a disappointing book.	2004-04-19

This is my second attempt at reading his material and I seriously wonder how this man ever got a book deal. ..... To sum it up, every 100 years the devil tries to come back to life and this time he targets a small town that harbors a secret sea of graves from unwanted/ill children.  Basically, evil babies, big and small, dig their way out of the mass graves to mutilate adults and children alike until they bring back the devil to rule through the &quot;one&quot; child.  The book is full of disfigured, oozing babies trying to take a bite out of anything that moves.  Am I the only one who finds this absurd????  After a few of the townies start shooting giant, green oozing babies I came to the conclusion that Bentley Little books should be dumped into mass graves instead.	2003-09-15

The copy I have happens to be a first edition, signed copy from \\"Dallas\\".  I was very excited to get started on this one, given all the controversy behind it.  I have to say I enjoyed the book to an extent, but it really lacks a complete story.  <br />As you know, the story involves friends from NY that visit their pal Carla, who is renting a lovely, isolated cabin by Dead River.  Once all are there, terrible savagrey falls upon them. The first 70 pages or so really center too heavily on Carla and the dispositions of her friends and their drive up. I found myself just skimming these lines in hopes of getting to the good stuff.  Once the \\"creatures\\" hit the cabin, the pace really picks up and the book maintains its pace through the end.  After finishing, I thought to myself....I want to know how the kids became what they were..  Where did this surrogate family start and how long ago?...Why did they pick this area to dwell in?...I think it's a history of this clan that I desired and not just a book that leads you to believe they just showed up one day and now they terrorize this costal town.  <br />All in all, it's an interesting read, and quite short.  The book really isn't at gross as some of the reviews hint, but don't expect lite gore either.  Since this book is so difficult to find, try a library or borrowing.  I wouldn't pay over 20 bucks for it, or you'll be disappointed.	2003-06-27

I was quite impressed with their writing and seeming knowledge of science.  This book is well written, fast paced and incredibly exciting.  <br />The story starts with a dig for a new complex in NY which happens to unearth a gruesome crime over a hundred years old.  Enter the strange FBI agent, the trusty reporter, the disgraced cop and career problemed archiologist.  For unknown reasons all become involved in a game of cat and mouse, each the target of a deranged killer. The end will suprise you and the book will consistently keep you at the edge of your seat.<br />I highly recommend this book.  I know I will be out purchasing more by this team of very savvy writers!	2003-06-27

Having read reviews for this book I figured this would be a perfect read for me.  Alas, I was wrong in my assumption.  This story is gross at times, and does have some humorous moments, but when all is said and done you really wonder what the point was.  <br />This story centers around a small town with a legend of the \\"bighead\\" and the long lost niece that comes back to visit her aunt with one of her city friends, who happens to be a coke addict and nympho.  Throw in some evil nuns, a prophane priest, two twisted punks and the devil and ya got yourself this story - in a nut shell.  I couldn't help but think the two punks (balls and dicky) were pointless, as was their violence and the fact they were never caught astounds me.  The story really lags throughout, lacking a certain spark I expected.  The end is so ridiculous and unexplained that I felt it was just tacked on for the heck of it.  I don't care if a book is gross, tacky, etc. but the story MUST be good.  When the story is good, who cares what lies within.  I must say - this story isn't good. I would rather read Ketchum any day!	2003-06-24

The vivid pictures of the hotel, the foggy coast, the mobster Uncle, the vampire family and love in bloom.  This is just a hint of what's inside this book.  This is an excellent story, written well, fast-paced and leaves you hanging, just a bit, in the end.  I'm hoping...sequel???...but no matter.

What if the outrages that have happened in this world, (i.e. war, Hitler, murders, etc.) have been a direct result of mind vampires?  People with super powers who can manipulate others to do their bidding.  What if these people get into their own war with each other?  This is the basis for this book.  I was so impressed with the depth of this book, the complex characters and the vivid descriptions.  Simmons writing reminds me of Stephen King, only better.  Highly recommend this book for an interesting, exciting read!	2003-04-11

I'm a huge fan of paranormal books, regardless of genre, and I also enjoy Nora Roberts.  So I borrowed this book from a friend because the premise sounded great.  Needless to say, what a bore.  The characters were underdeveloped, the magic lacking and the typical Nora Roberts passion gone.  I was so disappointed in Liams and Rowans lack of feeling or expression of it.  The flipant attitudes of the characters suprised me and by the end of the book I thought was a waste of time.  My suggestion is to stear clear of this one and pick up The Passion by Donna Boyd!	2003-04-11

I got this book because of the premise...Santa steps out on Mrs. Claus..there's bound to be some interesting results.  Interesting is not a word strong enough!  I love the strange, the morbid, the sick and demented, but this was extreme.  I couldn't help but think the book was written for shock-value in hopes of getting the curios to buy.  I guess it works in that respect.  The story involves Santa's affair with the Tooth Fairy and snowballs into a sex-fest.  There is very graphic sex involving everyone and their grandmother, to the sexual assult of a mortal woman by the Easter Bunny, who just happens to be a voyer.  Ummmm...can I just say...Ew[...]  I think the humor in the book is way off the mark and borders on sick. I can't even imagine what goes on in the head of the author to dream up such grim circumstances these characters create.  Highly disappointed with this novel and never, ever want to read it, or see it, again.	2002-04-12

I read this book a couple years ago and passed it along to my mother, who loved it.  This book is charming, funny, touching, sad and forgiving.  It's about the bond of lifetime friends, relationships between siblings and last, but not least, that special mother/daughter relationship.

I enjoyed that book so much, I rushed out and got Moonfall.  What a disappointment!!!!  Gone was the fast-paced, struggle of good and evil that kept me so glued in Haunted.  I found this book boring, lacking the excitement and creepy crawlers that I fully expected.  I trudged through this book just waiting for it to be over with, not caring much what happened to the characters and almost cheering for the satanic nuns with garter belts to kill them all!  Don't start with this book, go for another one of hers instead!	2002-03-28

The premise is fascinating, from the living blood and how it is shared, to the pain this particular man feels having loved and lost over so many years and his struggles with living a double life.  However, I don't think this book packs as much punch as it could.  I found the first 3/4's of the book slow, with only glimmers of excitment.  The ending was great, but it didn't make up for the rest of the book.  I have to say, I was disappointed.  I've heard so many good things about this book, that I was really looking forward to it, and it's sequel.  Now I'm not so sure I want to continue with the saga.  If I do, I won't be purchasing the book.  I suggest a trip to the library and hope for the best.	2002-03-28

Since I love anything involving haunted houses, I decided to make this my first venture into Bentley's world.  I must say, I wasn't impressed with this book.  I found it a bit boring, and for me, a struggle to get through.  I was also a little disturbed with the sexual nature associated with the little girl in the book.  I think the premise was great, but it got muddled along the way.  Unfortunately, I've not had the inclination to pick up another Little book since this one, and have no immediate plans to give him another shot.

I didn't know what to expect with this trilogy, and what I got, wasn't what I thought it would be. This tale is interesting, sometimes disturbing, sometimes touching and always erotic. The love/hate here knows no bounds between gender, age or race. There are some fascinating observations about human behavior, emotions and what lies deep inside each one of us. I've never read anything quite like this book and probably never will again. I recommend it just for curiosity of it all.	2002-03-28

I wasn't sure what to expect in this book, but was pleasantly surprised. The story line is sometimes a little choppy, but no matter.  It's an incredible journey of youthful friends torn apart by fear, hate and unintelligence. I saw a reviewer remark on the need of openmindedness to the homosexual relationships contained in the story. I'm not gay, but was touched by those relationships, as I think anyone should be, regardless of sexual orientation. I was also appalled at the treatment given to the characters just because of their preferences. I recommend this book to anyone and can't wait to read more from Rice!	2002-03-28

I would read it, put it down, not come back to it for weeks, until I finally got through it all.  I can't explain it, I just wasn't interested in him, or any of the other people in this book.  Above anything, I love vampire books, and this book just didn't cut it for me.  About the only thing I found interesting was how he fed.
