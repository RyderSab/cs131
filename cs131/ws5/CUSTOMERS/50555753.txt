Although the information presented is very compelling, it is somewhat outdated. <br /> <br />Written in 1997, many of the topics that author David Shenk describes in the future tense have already occured.  For example, he goes into great detain about the Y2K computer problem and the effect it could have on people's computers.  We all know that this turned out to be no problem at all.  Further, he mentions the need for a national no-call list for telemarketers.  Again, this has already happened since this book was published.  I feel that it is time for a new edition to be published with more up-to-date information. <br /> <br />I do feel that the idea of \\"data smog\\" the overabundance of information that is overwhelming people today, is covered very well.  I found the thirteen laws of data smog very interesting, and the antidotes to combat these laws were informative and helpful. <br /> <br />Overall, this book rates slightly above average, due to it being 8 years old, and many of the topics discussed have already taken place.  If the author were to write an updated edition, then I would rate it higher.  However, there are some good points that will make the reader think about the amout of information being placed for consumption and what we as consumers must do to filter out the smog so we can make good and informed choices.	2005-09-30

Located deep in the oil fields of Oklahoma, Bartlesville was home to Phillips Petroleum Company.  Phillips had great influence over many of the areas of Bartlesville, including the library.<br /><br />One of Miss Brown's favorite activities was planning story time and fun things for children.  She included black as well as white children at her gatherings.  This infuriated many of the townspeople, for Bartlesville, as with other areas of the country in the late 1940s and early 1950s, was engulfed in racism and segregation.  Also, Miss Brown was accused of having \\"submissive materials\\", including the magazines \\"The Nation\\" and \\"The New Republic\\" on the shelves.  Many people felt these were Communist-type propaganda magazines that should not be available to the general public.<br /><br />Miss Brown remained defiant.  She continued to hold her de-segregated story hours and shelve her \\"submissive\\" magazine, all to the chagrin of the \\"powers-that-be\\".  She even entered a downtown drug store with two African-American women and asked to be served.  She was refused.<br /><br />Finally, under pressure from the big wigs at Phillips, as well as other people in the community, the city commission removed Miss Brown as librarian for having submissive materials available to the general public, when in reality she was fired for promoting racial equality.<br /><br />Miss Brown eventually filed suit against the Bartlesville city commission, but she lost on appeal.  She then took a job in Mississippi at Piney Woods Country Life School, a school for African-Americans.<br /><br />Miss Brown died on September 10, 1975 at the age of eighty-four, but her legacy lives on.  She promoted racial harmony and equality during a time of the Ku-Klux Klan and lynchings.  She promoted free speech and expression during a time of censorship.  And she promoted the library as a place of learning which should be accessable to everyone.<br /><br />This is a fabulous book.  From the moment I started reading, I could not put it down.  The story told by author Louise Robbins is excellent, and her prose is easy to read and understand.  I give this book my absolute highest recommendation.  Read it and see how one woman's courageous struggle changed the landscape of censorship, race relations, and libraries forever.	2005-09-27

Normally, I wouldn't read anything like this book, but after finishing it, I was very glad I chose to read it, and I found myself wanting to learn more about this concept of the \\"Flat World\\".    Author Thomas Friedman presents his argument about the flattening of the world in clear and concise terms that are easy to understand, and he provides testimony from business and laypeople alike to back up his argument that the world is no longer round, but flat.  Friedman argues that there have been several occurances over the last ten years that have caused the world to flatten out, but the three that stick in my mind are the bringing down of the Berlin Wall, the availability of the Internet to a much wider group of users, and the ever-increasing amout of outsourcing to foreign countries by American companies.    With the fall of the Berlin Wall, many former Communist Bloc countries now had access to the rich knowledge and business operations of the West.  Also, the availability of the Internet to a much larger group of people provided them with the knowledge they needed to succeed in the flat world.  Finally, outsourcing to foreign companies has not only benefitted the American companies in terms of cheaper labor and benefits, the host country, such as India or China, have seen their economies skyrocket as a result of the increased job opportunities provided by these American firms.  Workers in these countries consider these jobs to be of much higher prestiege than American workers would, and they are not afraid to work 15 to 18 hour shifts.    Being a huge sports fan, I especially liked Friedman's reference to the U.S. Olympic men's basketball team as having to compete in a flattened world as well.  For years, the Americans dominated the sport of basketball in the Olympics, but recently, countries such as Argentina (who won gold in the 2004 Athens games) have been able to study thetactics of the Americans and, by using such tools as the Internet, have closed the gap so much that they were able to overtake the Americns at their own game.    I found this book to be a fascinating read.  Friedman presents his arguments clearly, and he backs his points up with testimonies from business leaders such as Bill Gates and Jerry Yang.  The text reads like a novel.  If business leaders of the twenty-first century fail to realize that they are indeed living in a flat world and fail to adapt their business practices appropriately, they will undoubtedly be left behind by the strategic thinkers in the industry.  I highly recommend this fine book. Read it and learn what businesses, firms, and individuals must do to survive in a flat world.	2005-09-19

In this book, author Marc Landas takes the reader on a journey that started with a B-29 raid in May, 1945, and ended with consequences that no one could have ever imagined. <br /> <br />The pilot of one of the B-29s on that fateful raid was Marvin Watkins.  Along with his crew of nine other men, they were returning to their base when they were attacked by Japanese fighters.  Suffering fatal damage, Watkins ordered his crew to bail out while he stayed at the controls of the plane.  One by one, the men bailed out.  But as it turned out, their worst fears were just beginning, for after being captured by the Japanese Kempei Tai, they faced horrors unimaginable to most people. <br /> <br />The surviving eight men from Watkins' B-29, along with thirty-nine other American POWS, were either beheaded by the Japanese, or, in the case of Watkins' crew, subjected to inhumane and fatal medical experiments.  On three different occasions, the beheadings occured, and on one of the occasions, the war had already ended.  The men who were used for the medical experiments  had seawater pumped into their veins as well as having lungs, stomachs, and livers removed.  They were alive but unconscious the entire time; they ultimately died. <br /> <br />In November, 1945, the Americans, acting on a tip from an informant about the downing of Watkins' plane, began an investigation into the possibility of Japanese atrocities being committed against the American POWs.  Over the course of the next 2+ years, the investigation turned up allegations of behheadings and medical experiments.  Many Japanese were indicted and a trial began in 1948.  Through the meticulous work of the American investigators and prosecutors, several Japanese officers were found guilty of murder and handed sentences ranging from death by hanging to several years of hard labor.  However, due to the rising threat of the Soviet Union and China, the Americans realized that an allied Japan would help stem the flow of Communism in the region.  In a move that left me as a reader dumfounded, the Americans gave all of the convicted Japanese officers clemency in the name of establishing friendly relations between the United States and Japan. <br /> <br />I found this to be a very eye-opening book.  It is inconcievable to me how the Japanese, who were found guilty at trial, were  allowed to get off scott-free, while the American POWs were murdered at the hands of these same Japanese officers.  As for the book itself, the author does an extraordinary job of describing the downing of the B-29, as well as the beheadings and the other atrocities committed by the Japanese.  People who think the United States was barbaric in using the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki should read this book and learn what real barbarism was.	2005-08-26

From the attack on Pearl Harbor to the surrender of Japan, this book covers every major campaign of the Pacific war and includes testimonies from ordinary men who went on to become some of the best pilots in the world.  Included are testimonies from Butch O'Hare, America's first ace, who shot down six enemy bombers over the aircraft carrier Lexington, Jimmy Thatch, a true innovator and creator of the \\"Thatch Weave\\"; a highly successful technique which enabled slower American fighters to compete with the Japanese Zero fighter, Ira Kepford, another Navy pilot who ended the war with over 20 confirmed kills, Alex Vraciu, another 20+ ace who shot down six enemy planes during the Marianas Turkey Shoot, and David McCampbell, the leading Navy ace with 34 kills, who shot down 9 enemy planes during the battle of the Philippine Sea.    This book is a good introductory volume to the air war in the Pacific, but it doesn't go into great depth.  The oral histories presented by the pilots are very interesting, but the narrative provided by the author is somewhat weak, and there are several mistakes in the book.  For instance, the author refers to Japanese submarines as \\"U-Boats\\" throughout the book.  This terminology is incorrect; the Germans used that phrase for their submarines.  Also, he refers to the SBD Dauntless dive bomber as the SPD.  These may be minor details, but for true World War II history buffs, they do stick out somewhat.    There are two areas of the book which stick out above the others in my opinion.  Astor's description of the mission in which Butch O'Hare was shot down is described in great detail, and the story of the ill-fated Japanese battleship Yamato suicide mission during the Okinawa campaign is told in a very exciting manner.    Overall, I did enjoy this book.However, I've read better books on the subject.  If you are looking for basic information on the air war in the Pacific, then this book will help in that aspect; just don't expect a lot of detail on the specific battles.	2005-08-18

Locked away for some 45 years, these vivid, graphic, and moving photos show what life was like immediately after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br /><br />O'Donnell's photo archive begins with images from his arrival in Japan.  A prayer service offered aboard a landing ship, and the unloading of equipment are shown in this section.  The harbor at Sasebo is photographed with many American ships filling its waters, but it is in this section where the reader gets their first glimpse of the level of destruction wrought by American planes; most of the surrounding city is literally flattened.  Many displaced Japanese citizens are shown wandering the streets of what has become a barren wasteland.<br /><br />O'Donnell has also included images of American soldiers giving candy to Japanese children, and Japanese geishas performing dances.  Images of children with babies strapped to their backs cleaning rubble and elderly displaced civilians with few or no possessions really touch the reader.<br /><br />The most eye-catching part of the book for me was the images of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Both cities were literally wiped off the face of the earth; only massive piles of rubble remained.  O'Donnell had to travel by horse to navigate through the massive piles of debris.  Images of people wandering about aimlessly, smashed factories, and burn victims dominate this part of the book.<br /><br />The most piognant pictures I saw in the book are the one of the three brothers in Nagasaki; the eldest pushing his brothers in a make-shift cart, and the most heartbreaking one, the photo of the child who has come to the cremation site in Nagasaki with his dead baby brother strapped to his back, all the while struggling to keep from crying.  I can't remember seeing a more moving photograph.<br /><br />This is a tremendous book.  Each photograph tells its own story, and O'Donnell has provided excellent narrative above each photo.  I highly recommend this fine book.  Open it up and take a photographic journey through a defeated Japan.  Some photos will inspire awe; others pity, and you'll get a true sense of what it was like in Japan immediately after the war ended.remendous book.

Due to their advance, the United States Navy was looking for a forward base which could also serve as a fleet anchorage.  The Palaus island group was selected for that purpose, with the island of Peleliu being the main objective.  For the next thirty days, the Marines that landed on the tiny coral island faced some of the most brutal fighting of the entire war.    Due mostly to faulty intelligence, the Marines thought that they would be facing many fewer Japanese than they actually encountered.  An operation which was supposed to take, in the words of Marine General William H. Rupertus, no more than a few days, turned into a month-long struggle for survival, as nearly 11,000 Japanese troops were dug in in a series of caves, tunnels, and pillboxes.  The American landing force consisted of only 9,000 men.    For one month, the Americans slugged it out with the Japanese defenders.  Many of the island's natural features took on a life of their own.  Places such as \\"The Pocket\\", \\"The Great Wall of China\\", and \\"The Five Sisters\\" soon took on images of death and destruction that the Marines would just as soon forget.  Typical of the Japanese and their Bushido code, they literally fought to the last man, and only about three dozen surrendered to the Americans.      Many of the surviving Marines have openly questioned the necessity of the Palaus campaign.  Peleliu and its neighboring islands had little or no effect on the upcoming Philippines campaign, and Admiral Nimitz had been criticized for not following Admiral Halsey's advice to totally bypass the Palaus.  The veterans also blame their superiors, General Rupertus and Colonel \\"Chesty\\" Puller for some of their losses during the battle.  Puller has been characterized as \\"a butcher who callously disregarded the lives of his men\\", while Rupertus was accused of pushing his men too hard.  Admiral Jesse Olendorf's ineffective pre-invasion bombardment also led to the carnage when the Marines went ashore.  Was Peleliu worth it?  Many of the survivors think not.    I thought this was a very good book.  Author David Sloan, who also wrote the excellent \\"Given Up for Dead\\" about the heroic defenders of Wake Island, concentrates his study on Company K, 3rd Batallion, 5th Marine Regiment.  This group began the campaign with approximately 275 men, but by the time the battle was over, their numbers had dropped to well under 100.  Names such as Sgt. Fred Miller, Lt. Ed Jones, Seymour Levy, \\"Red\\" Womack, and PFC Arthur Jackson became synonimous with American bravery while facing the fanatical Japanese. From blasting pillboxes to providing aid to a fallen comrade, this company fought on the front lines longer than any other unit on Peleliu.    I highly recommend this book. Although it seems to drag a little at some points (my reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5), it is still packed with action as Sloan does a teriffic job of describing the battle from both American and Japanese points of view.  Read this book and see how one small group of Marines helped to capture a vital island in the Pacific.	2005-08-01

Glusman has written a masterful book about the horrible conditions Allied POWs faced as prisoners of the Japanese.  In particular, this book concentrates on the lives of four American doctors; Lt. George Ferguson, Lt. Fred Berley, Lt. John Jacob Bookman, and Lt. Murray Glusman.  All were stationed in the Philippines when the Japanese attacked shortly after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.    After enduring the defeat of Bataan, and later Corregidor, some 78,000 American and Filipino POWs were forced to march over seventy miles in what became known as the Bataan Death March.  For the next three and a half years, Ferguson, Berley, Bookman, and Glusman were at the mercy of their Japanese captors.  Food and water rations were virtually nonexistant, beatings were frequent, and the work was long and hard.  The atrocities committed by the Japanese can only be described as barbaric, and the doctors did the best they could to help the sick and wounded with virtually no medical supplies at all.      Eventually, the doctors were loaded aboard Japanese \\"Hell Ships\\"; overcrowded freighters converted into ships to carry POWs to mainland Japan.  The conditions on the ships were worse than in the camps.  Men were placed in vastly overcrowded and stifling holds, given virtually no food or water, and were unable to even lie down due to the crowding.  But the greatest fear faced by the POWs was attack by American submarines.  Once torpedoed, the Japanese were known to machine gun the surviving POWs in the water.  Indeed, George Ferguson died when the ship he was on was torpedoed.    Once in Japan, the remaining three doctors were once again placed in concentration camps where they tended the wounded and sick.  But as time wore on, they soon began to see hundreds of American B-29 bombers winging above them.  They surmised that the Americans must be close to winning the war.  However, they still had to endure the firebomb raids of Kobe and Osaka that virtually destroyed the cities.  However, after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of 1945, the Japanese finally surrendered, and John, Murray, and Fred were finally able to return home.    This is a spectacular book.  John Glusman does an excellent job of describing the fall of the Philippines, the Bataan Death March, and the atrocities that the POWs faced at the hands of the Japanese.  My favorite part of the book was the extremely vivid description of the firebombing raids on Japan in the spring of 1945.  I give this book my highest recommendation.  Read and see how four ordinary men from the heartland of the United States managed to survive against a brutal and unforgiving enemy.	2005-07-20

But beginning with the Doolittle raid in April of 1942 abd followed by the Battle of the Coral Sea in May, the Americans had finally begun to check the Japanese advance.  The Japanese, infected with \\"victory disease\\", nevertheless felt that if they could draw the U.S. Pacific fleet away from Pearl Harbor, they would be able to destroy the remains and continue on toward Hawaii and perhaps the West Coast.<br /><br />However, the Americans had one huge advantage over the Japanese.  The Americans were able to read the Japanese JN-25 naval code, and this provided a wealth of information as to where the Japanese planned to strike next.  Under the command of Joe Rochefort, the code-breakers at Pearl Harbor soon had enough information to predict that the Japanese were going to strike at Midway.  The Americans would be waiting for them.<br /><br />On one fateful day in June, 1942, the tide of the war in the Pacific turned against the Japanese.  In the span of only a few minutes, three Japanese aircraft carriers, all veterans of the Pearl Harbor attack, were sunk by American dive bombers.  The fourth Japanese carrier was sunk later in the day.  The Americans lost the carrier USS Yorktown, but it was a relatively small price to pay for such a smashing victory.  American industrial capacity had increased by this time, and new carriers would soon be coming into service, so the loss of the Yorktown was diminished.  The Japanese, however, had nowhere near the capacity of the United States. The Japanese never recovered from this terrible blow.<br /><br />I've read Prange's excellent analysis of Pearl Harbor, and this book does just as good of a job describing the battle of Midway.  From the initial sighting of the Japanese fleet to the final withdrawl, Prange describes the battle in a manner that will keep the reader enthralled throughout.  Prange earned the title of \\"The Dean of Pearl Harbor\\" with his masterful trilogy, now he has added the battle of Midway to that impressive list.  I highly recommend this great book.  Read it and discover how a small American fleet destroyed a vastly superior enemy force and turned the tide forever against the Japanese.itial sighting of the Japanese fleet to the final withdrawl, Prange describes the battle in a manner that will keep the reader enthralled throughout.

Author Bruce Gamble has done a teriffic job of describing Marine squadron 214 and their heroic actions over the Solomons during 1943-1944.  Commanded by  Major Gregory \\"Pappy\\" Boyington, a hard-drinking, hardfighting pilot, the Black Sheep compiled a record of enemy kills that other squadrons could only dream about. <br /> <br />Boyington himself was credited with twenty-eight enemy planes shot down, including six as a member of the famed \\"Flying Tigers\\".  He was the leading Marine Corps ace of WWII. <br /> <br />I remember as a child watching the television show \\"Black Sheep Squadron\\" with Robert Conrad starring as Boyington.  I enjoyed each episode, and that experience made reading this book that much more enjoyable.  Gamble does an excellent job of describing the evolution of VMF 214 from their days on Guadalcanal to their heyday under Boyington.  After Boyington was shot down and captured by the Japanese in January, 1944, the remaining members of VMF 214 were assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Franklin, but they endured tremendous hardship when the Franklin was nearly sunk by a Japanese dive bomber in March, 1945. <br /> <br />I've been a World War II aviation reader for many years, and this is one of the best books I've read.  The many battles fought by the Black Sheep are described in great detail.  I highly recommend this great book.

This book contains numerous photos of the attack, both in black and white and color, along with informative maps and drawings.  The narrative is very good and provides an authoritative, minute-by-minute account of the attack. <br /> <br />Oral histories from both Japanese and American personnel, as well as Hawaiian civilians are also included.  These exciting testimonies give the reader a true sense of what it was like to be at Pearl Harbor during the attack.  From a captured Japanese midget submarine crewman to American sailors and airmen, their stories are brought to life inside the book. <br /> <br />One section I found especially interesting was the list of casualties included at the back of the book.  One look at the size and length of this section will make the reader realize just how tragic and costly December 7, 1941 was for the United Staes armed forces. <br /> <br />Finally, the photos of the USS Arizona memorial, with the \\"Mighty Mo\\" serving as a guard, bring a poignant end to the book, and lets the reader know that December 7 will never be forgotten. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.  I've read numerous books on this subject, and I was very impressed with the quality of the photos as well as the accompanying text.  As a stand-alone volume or companion to another book, this work of history deserves its place as one of the best books on the subject of Pearl Harbor.

Jackson got his inspiration for this great book by coming across a lock of hair that his mother had sent to his father, who was a radioman aboard the Santa Fe. <br /> <br />The Santa Fe was one of the newest light cruisers in the Pacific fleet.  weighing in at 11,000 tons, it was hard to describe her as \\"light\\".  She packed a powerful punch, with twelve six-inch guns in her main battery, and numerous 5-inch, 40mm, and 20mm for anti-aircraft defense.  She also held the record for the longest cruise without being sent back to the United States, but she claimed her nickname, the \\"Lucky Lady\\", from somehow managing to stay out of harm's way, and she suffered no casualties of her own during the course of the war. <br /> <br />The Franklin was one of the new Essex-class aircraft carriers that began rolling out of U.S. Navy shipyards in early 1943.  At over 850 feet long, she was nearly as big as three football fields, plus she could carry 100 aircraft as well.  However, she had her share of run-ins with the Japanese and, unlike the Santa Fe, was heavily damaged by a kamakaze in October 1944. <br /> <br />These two ships' lives intertwined forever on the day of March 19, 1945.  Sailing less than 100 miles from mainland Japan, an enemy dive bomber managed to make it past the combat air patrol and the anti-aircraft defenses to put two 500 lb bombs into the Franklin.  The carrier was loaded with bombs, torpedoes, and thousands of gallons of oil and aviation gas and soon became a blazing inferno.  The Santa Fe was part of the screening force surrounding the carrier group and was soon on her way to help the injured flattop.  Undeterred by the flames and explosions, the captain of the Santa Fe manuvered his ship directly alongside the Franklin to assist in fire-fighting operations and the removal of injured personnel.For over two hours, the Santa Fe risked herself to help the Franklin and its crew. <br /> <br />Despite the horrendous damage and the loss of over 700 of her crew, the Franklin managed to limp back to the United States under her own power for repairs. <br /> <br />Much of the credit for the saving of the Franklin belongs to her heroic crew, who fought fires and rescued wounded comrades without regards for thier own personal safety.  The Santa Fe also deserves credit for assisting in fire fighting operations as well as removal of wounded men while placing herself directly in harm's way. <br /> <br />This is an extraordinary book.  The author does an excellent job of describing the saga of these two ships and their crews.  The camaraderie of the crewmembers shines through on each page, and the heroics of these young men are discussed vividly.  He devotes equal time to the stories of each ship, their crew, and the battles they fought.  The highlight of the book is the impeccable narrative concerning the bombing attack on the Franklin and the heroic actions of the Santa Fe to help the injured carrier.  Read this excellent work of naval history and discover how two ships, working together, overcame nearly impossible odds.	2005-07-05

In the beginning, Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi are piloting their starfighters in battle against the Separatists in order to save Chancellor Palpatine, head of the Republic.  Commanded by General Grievous and Count Dooku, the Separatists have placed Palpatine in a starship and are luring Skywalker and Kenobi  towards them. <br /> <br />Anakin and Palpatine have enjoyed a very close relationship since Anakin was a young boy.  Now \\"The Chosen One\\", Anakin still seeks advice and guidance from Palpatine.  However, many members of the Jedi Council fear that the relationship between Anakin and Palpatine may explode into something much worse than what it is. <br /> <br />Anakin and Padme, married now for several years, are shocked and excited to find out that they are about to become parents.  But, they also know that as long as Anakin is a Jedi, they will never be able to be together and raise their family. This knowledge places much strain on their relationship, and Anakin is troubled by nightmares of Padme dying in childbirth. <br /> <br />As the book progresses, Anakin continues to slip more towards Palpatine and farther away from Obi-Wan and the Jedi council.  Palpatine fills his head with many things, and Anakin finds himself believing everything he is told by Palpatine.  The Jedi also find out that Palpatine is threatening to dissolve the Jedi council completely.  The Chancellor finally reveals himself as Darth Sidious, leader of the Sith, and in turn influences Anakin about the dark side of the Force.  Will Anakin be strong enough to resist Palpatine?  Can the Jedi stop Palpatine before its too late?  What will happen between Anakin and Padme? <br /> <br />This is an excellent book.  If you've already seen the movie, you'll find yourself remembering scenes from the film as you read.  If you haven't seen the movie, this book will serve as a perfect introduction.  Read this exciting chapter in the Star Wars series and experience Anakin's ultimate fall to the dark side.	2005-06-16

After much careful consideration by the American commanders, most notably Admiral Nimitz, it was decided that the Americans would try to intercept Yamamoto's flight and shoot down his plane.  The Americans were concerned that this mission might compromise their secret knowledge of the Japanese codes, but it was decided to proceed anyway. <br /> <br />Eighteen P-38 Lightning fighters lifted off from Guadalcanal early on that April morning.  Led by John Mitchell, the flight flew for over 400 miles at heights no greater than 50 feet above the water.  It was the longest fighter intercept mission of the war.  A 'killer group\\" of four P-38s was assigned to attack the Betty bombers which were carrying Yamamoto and his staff.  Among the hunter group were Tom Lanphier, Rex Barber, Besby Holmes, and  Ray Hine.   <br /> <br />Once the dogfight began, the sky became a crowded mass of planes fighting for their lives.  In the end, Yamamoto's bomber, along with the other Betty bomber, were shot down and Yamamoto was killed, but this is where the controversy began.  Each pilot in the hunter group claimed responsibility for shooting down Yamamoto.  Who actually did it?  In the end, it was accepted that Tom Lanphier shot down Yamamoto, but author Donald Davis does a remarkable job of piecing together each pilot's story and sheds enough doubt to question Lanphier's claims. <br /> <br />This is an excellent work of military history.  Donald Davis does a fine job of describing Yamamoto's life as a young militatry attache in Washington during the 1920s as well as the meticulous planning for the Pearl Harbor attack and the failures of Midway and Guadalcanal.  The reader gets a true sense of what Yamamoto was like; a reluctant admiral who knew that fighting a war against the United States would lead to ultimate defeat for Japan. <br /> <br />The story of the intercept flight, dogfight, and aftermath is some of the most exciting reading that I've read.  The reader gets the sense of being in the cockpit of one of the P-38s on the fateful mission, and the aftermath, with its many individual claims and the subsequent near-disaster of the revealing that we had indeed broken the Japanese code, are presented with extreme realism and action.  I highly recommend this great book.  The action is fast-paced and the story reads like an action novel.  Read this excellent work and learn how a million-to-one mission came together in the skies over the Pacific.	2005-06-07

After reading \\"Winter's Heart\\", I was hoping the momentum would finally continue for more than one book, but, true to form, the series has AGAIN slowed down. <br /> <br />As for the plot (I use that term loosely), here's what's going on:      <br />Mat is still fleeing from the Seanchan, Perrin is still hunting for the Shaido, who still hold his wife Faile captive, Camelyn and Tar Valon are under siege, the Aes Sedai are considering an alliance with the Black Tower, Rand is pondering a truce with the Seanchan, there is a face-off between Egwene and her forces, who are laying siege to Elaida's forces inside the White Tower, and finally Tuon, the Daughter of the Nine Moons and the one who Mat is destined to marry, has being concealed by Valan Luca's travelling show. <br /> <br />There are many plots and sub-plots going on at the same time, but none are really developed fully.  As in the previous book, Perrin is still trying to rescue Faile, but Jordan never really pursues this storyline to completion.  It is just left to \\"wither on the vine\\".  The jumping from one story to the next left me confused and I actually forgot what I was reading during some passages.  I felt Rand's basic omission from this book was a mistake, and I found it difficult to follow what he was actually doing when he was mentioned.  The same goes for Mat.   <br /> <br />I'm glad to be done with this series for the time being.  I realize that book 11 is due to be released in the near future, and I can only hope that Robert Jordan has drastically changed his writing style in this new book.  Otherwise, I'll have to plow through another huge volume that has no real sense of direction.	2005-05-24

Frances is a cute little badger who has a passion for bread and jam; so much so that she refuses to eat anything else. <br /> <br />Breakfast, lunch, and dinner consist of the same thing; a slice of bread with some jam spread on top.  Frances refuses to try the other meals her mother makes, such as veal cutlets or soft-boiled eggs.  She just happily eats her bread and jam and skips rope.  Eventually, her mother and father only fix her bread and jam, while they eat other types of food.  Soon, Frances is asking why she is not getting such things as spaghetti and meatballs, while the other family members are.  Finally, Frances agrees to try the other food, and much to her surprise, she enjoys it very much. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful book for young children, and it provides them with a valuable lesson; too much of a good thing can turn out to be bad.  The pictures are fun to look at, and the story is very entertaining.  I can remember hearing this story when I was a child, and my own children have grown to love it just as much as I did.  I highly recommend this great book.  Your childen will surely enjoy hearing about Frances and her picky eating, and how with a little love and encouragment from her parents, she learns to try new things.	2005-05-23

Their target was the Italian naval base at Taranto.  Lying at anchor were six battleships, along with several cruisers and destroyers.  This group made up the majority of the Italian Navy. <br /> <br />Relying on the navigational skills of the pilots, the British aircraft swarmed over the harbor, dropping flares to illuminate the ships and dropping torpedoes and bombs while facing murderous anti-aircraft fire from the Italians.  For the loss of only two aircraft, the British managed to sink three battleships, three cruisers, and a destroyer.  This successful raid greatly altered the balance of power in the Mediterranean and forced the Italians to move the rest of their fleet to safer harbors in northern Italy. <br /> <br />I was a little disappointed with this book.  The title is somewhat misleading, for the actual attack on Taranto is only covered in two chapters.  Much of the remainder of the book deals with the development of the British carriers in the pre-war years.  Much time is also spent on the entire battle of the Mediterranean; something that maybe should have been left to a larger book.  The chapters that actually deal with the attack itself are very good, and the attack is described in great detail. Being a Pearl Harbor buff, I also enjoyed the chapter that compares the Taranto raid to the attack on Pearl Harbor. <br /> <br />I feel that this could have been a much better book if the author would have devoted more space to the actual Taranto raid.  One to two chapters just doesn't due the attack justice. I did enjoy learning about the battles in the Mediterranean. However, I read this book hoping to learn about the Taranto raid, and after finishing it, I didn't learn much more than I already knew before reading the book.  If you're interested in learning about the whole battle for the Mediterranean Sea, then this book does a fairly good job of describing it, but it lacks quite a bit in the description of the attack on Taranto.	2005-04-28

Missouri on September 2, 1945.  Each major campaign of the Pacific war is covered.  Battles such as the Coral Sea, where the Japanese were turned back for the first time, Midway, where the Japanese lost four aircraft carriers in a matter of minutes, Guadalcanal, where a six-month struggle ensued, and concluding with the bloody battles of Iwo Jima, where twenty seven medals of honor were awarded, and Okinawa, where the Japanese kamikazes wreaked havoc with the American fleet. <br /> <br />Each battle is described through the oral histories of the men who actually fought there.  These testimonies shed light on what it was really like to fight against the fanatical Japanese, who were known to fight to the last man, never surrender, and beat and starve American POWs.  Although North's narrative is good, the oral testimonies are the best part of this book. <br /> <br />An excellent DVD is also included.  It describes the battle of Midway and the invasion of the Marianas.  Actual footage along with expert narration by North make this bonus DVD a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br />Along with covering all of the major battles of the Pacific war, North also includes some lesser-known items as well.  These include interesting chapters about the Flying Tigers, a group of volunteer American fighter pilots who fought the Japanese in China, the Black Sheep, a group of Marine fighter pilots led by Gregory \\"Pappy\\" Boyington who became the terrors of the South Pacific, and the attack on the POW camp at Cabanatuan which freed over 500 American POWs.   <br /> <br />Overall, I thought this was a very good book.  North does a good job of blending the narrative and the oral histories together, and the photographs and maps are extremely detailed.  However, there were some mistakes, such as the Japanese battleship Yamato being referred to as the Yamamoto, and the false claim that the American carrier Saratoga was sunk off of Iwo Jima.  The Saratoga actually survived the war.  I recommend this book to people who are looking for a general overview of the Pacific war.  The information provides a good foundation for each battle of the Pacific campaign, but does not go into great detail.  The DVD makes the book that much better.  Pick up this book and learn a little about each phase of the war in the Pacific.	2005-04-21

Jenkins and Tim LaHaye introduce the reader to a new group of characters and old friends as well. <br /> <br />Marilena Carpathia and her husband Sorin are professors at a university in Romania.  Married by name and title only, there is no real love or romance in their marriage; only intellectual conversation and platonic companionship.  Bored with her marriage, Marilena begins attending meetings at the local library conducted by Viviana Ivinisova, a woman who claims to be able to speak with the spirit world. <br /> <br />Drawn in by Viv's lectures and teachings, Marilena becomes more and more intrigued by her.  Meanwhile, Marilena is having feelings of her own; maternal feelings.  She explains her feelings to Viv, who encourages her to follow through on them.  Knowing that Sorin has no interest in being a father after announcing to Marilena that he is a homosexual, she, along with Viv, seek help through artificial means. <br /> <br />Viv has also been receiving messages from the spirit world about Marilena's unborn child.  The child, called the \\"chosen one\\", is to be raised to worship Lucifer and follow his teachings.  Soon, a boy, Nicolae, is born to Marilena, and Viv moves in with her to help raise the child in the prescribed manner. <br /> <br />Things go along smoothly for a few years, but soon Nicolae is beginning to pull away from his mother, leaving her confused and hurt.  Nicolae is also showing maturity way beyond his young years, even mastering several different languages and complex subjects.  Viv is encouraging Nicolae's continued growth, while Marilena has been left in the background, slowly falling farther away from her son.  Eventually, Viv and Nicolae end up leaving Marilena to set off on their own.  What will happen to Marilena?  Will Nicolae fulfill his pre-determind prophecy and become the Antichrist? <br /> <br />At the same time, in the small Northern Illinois town of Belvidere, Rayford Steele is having his own problems.  Faced with the task of choosing a career in commercial aviation or taking over the family business, Ray struggles with the choices he must make.  He ultimately decides on aviation and attends college on an ROTC scholarship to Purdue University.  He meets two beautiful women; Kitty and Irene.  Polar opposites of one another, Ray must choose between the two. <br /> <br />Overall, I thought this was a good book, but there are some points that I had problems with.  For instance, the first part of the book moves along rather slowly in real time, but after the first half of the book, the pace picks up incredibly, and several years of real time are covered.  (I believe that Nicolae is 24 years old by the end of the book).  It seems to me that a great deal of detail was left out in the second part of the book.  However, this does not take away from the great story.  Jenkins' writing has always kept me interested, and this book is a real page-turner.  I especially enjoyed the story of Ray Steele and how he evolved into a commercial pilot.  Conversely, Nicolae's and Marilena's story is much more dark and sinister, but still enjoyable nonetheless.  I've read all of the other books of the series, and this is on par with any of the others. Soon, Nicolae and Rayford will clash in the ultimate battle of good vs. evil that will shake the world to its very existance.  Pick up this great book and read about Nicolae, Rayford, and Irene before they were \\"Left Behind\\".	2005-04-13

In October of 1945, the Chicago Cubs were playing the Detroit Tigers in the World Series.  Games 1-3 were held in Detroit, where the Cubs won two of the three games.  Returning to Chicago, the Cubs had hopes of closing out the series in front of the hometown fans.  One of the fans who came to see the Cubs was William \\"Billy Goat\\" Sianis, a Greek immigrant who owned a nearby tavern. <br /> <br />Sianis came to the park with two box seat tickets; one for himself and the other for his pet billy goat \\"Murphy\\".  Ushers immediately tried to prevent Sianis and his goat from entering, but they failed to keep them out.  Once inside, Billy and his goat made their way onto the field before the ushers intervened again.  Billy and Murphy were allowed to take the seats they had purchased, but, under orders from Cubs owner Phillip K. Wrigley, Billy and Murphy were ejected from the game due to, according to Wrigley, the goat's odor.  Outraged, Sianis placed a curse on the Cubs that they would never win another pennant or play in the World Series.  The birth of the \\"billy goat\\" curse had occurred. <br /> <br />The Cubs eventually lost the 1945 World Series to the Tigers and Sianis sent a telegram to Wrigley stating \\"Who stinks now?\\" <br /> <br />From that fateful series against the Tigers until today, the Cubs have never won a pennant or played in a World Series, just as Sianis said they wouldn't.  There have been close calls (1969, 1984, 1989, 1998, and 2003), but ultimately something happened to spoil the Cubs dreams, such as the black cat incident in New York in 1969, Leon Durham's misplayed ground ball in 1984, and the infamous Steve Bartman foul ball interference in 2003.  Although classifed as an \\"Urban Legend\\", many Cubs fans really believe in the curse.  I must say that everything that Sianis said would happen to the Cubs has happened.  How much can be attributed to the curse or to just poor luck or bad play?   <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book a great deal.  Although it is relatively short, it still gives very good information about the curse and some of the other lesser-known Cubs curses, such as the curse of Fred Merkle.  I highly recommend this book.  Baseball fans and, more specifically, Cubs fans like myself, will enjoy this fun look at one of the most famous curses of all time and how it has affected the Cubs for sixty years.	2005-04-05

From humble beginnings as a youngster in Cuba to the bright lights of major league baseball stadiums, Canseco lays everything on the line, including his use of anabolic steroids. <br /> <br />Called \\"The Chemist\\", Canseco was a human guinea pig for steroid use by major league baseball players.  He freely passed his knowledge of steroids on to trainers and fellow players such as Mark McGwire, Jason Giambi, and Rafael Palmeiro, even claiming to have personally injected many of the players himself. <br /> <br />Canseco claims that many of today's baseball superstars are actively using steroids, and judging from the way many of these players have \\"bulked up\\" and enjoyed second primes in their careers, I would tend to agree with him.  Just take a look at Barry Bonds or Sammy Sosa early in their careers and compare that image to what they look like now and its easy to see that Canseco probably has a good argument. <br /> <br />There are many interesting aspects to this book.  I enjoyed reading about Jose's rise to stardom from a difficult childhood and the support he received from his mother.  Conversely, I think that he overplayed the \\"downtrodden\\" and \\"singled out\\" Latino just a bit too much.  There are many examples in the book where Jose believes that racism was involved against him and even called Mark McGwire and Cal Ripken \\"America's Boy\\".  I believe that in some instances race MIGHT have been a factor, but I believe that he may be overexageratting as well. <br /> <br />Jose also believes that, if taken correctly in conjunction with diet and exercise, steroids can be beneficial.  This might be true, but Ken Caminiti, a former player for the San Diego Padres, just recently died from the effects of steroids.  I don't know if I would want to take my chances so easily. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a very interesting book that sheds light ona very controversial issue.  Baseball needs to clean up its steroid mess and put some hard and fast rules in place to stop the use of performance-enhancing drugs.  Canseco does a very good job of explaining how steroids work and he gives the names of suspected steroid users.  You can choose to believe him yourself about him injecting other players.  The bottom line is there is a problem that needs to be addressed, and this book has finally shed some light on a topic that has been around for a long time and needs to be looked at by the powers-that-be in baseball.	2005-04-01

One book will be fairly good, while the following book will be disappointing, and so on.  Such is the case with \\"Winter's Heart\\".  It was much better than its predecessor, \\"The Path of Daggers\\", and the action has once again picked up considerably.<br /><br />There are many sub-plots contained in this book.  At the beginning, Faile is captured by the Shaido and Perrin sets off to find her, but abruptly, this storyline ends.  I was disappointed with the way Robert Jordan handled this aspect of the book, because this had the makings of a very interesting part of the story.  It was a shame that he let this part die, unless he plans to re-visit it in the next volume.  Elayne is still waiting to claim the crown of Andor, and she, Min, and Aviendha have bonded Rand as their Warder.  And, in perhaps the most exciting ending of any of the books so far, Rand finally changes the balance of power in his battle against the Dark One.<br /><br />I thought this book was a step up from book eight.  Aside from his unexplained abandonment of the Perrin/Faile story, this book moves along at a fairly good pace.  I especially liked the way Jordan developed the society of Far Madding, where channeling cannot take place.  The final chapter is some of Jordan's best work so far, and the end of the book is very exciting.  I hope that the momentum that has been created here will carry over into the next book, but I'm a little skeptical, as each good book in the series has usually been followed by a poor one.  Hopefully, that pattern has finally been broken.	2005-03-25

Many thought that Kimmel was made out to be a scapegoat and did not deserve to be relieved, but Roosevelt felt that a new commander was needed to lift America out of the ashes of Pearl harbor and begin the road to ultimate victory.  The man chosen for the task was Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. <br /> <br />Nimitz was chosen over many higher-ranking officers, but in the end, Nimitz proved to be the perfect choice to lead the American Navy.  Blessed with a keen sense of fairness to his fellow man, this fine book examines Nimitz and his admirals and how they ultimately won the war in the Pacific. <br /> <br />Although Nimitz was considered a \\"calm tower of strength\\" and the principal architect of victory in the Pacific, he could not have accomplished this feat alone.  His choices of supporting staff members and Admirals are the ones who, in the end, helped win the war for the United States. <br /> <br />This book examines many of Nimitz' Admirals, but four really stand out above the rest: Ray Spruance, Bill Halsey, Kelly Turner, and Marc Mitscher.  Halsey was the fire and brimstone commander who fearlessly took on the Japanese in the early days of the war.  He also said that after he was finished, the only place where the Japanese language would be spoken was in hell.  Spruance was the antithesis of Halsey.  Calm and cerebral, Spruance endeared himself to Nimitz with his careful consideration of the task at hand.  It was said that Halsey could win a battle, but Spruance could win a campaign.  Turner was cut from the same mold as Halsey.  Fearless and intimidating, even to a fault, Turner was the architect of the brilliant amphibious landings of the war.  Meanwhile, Mitscher was in charge of the fast carriers and endeared himself to his fliers by lighting up his entire force's lights to help bring the boys home after a nighttime raid against the Japanese.  In the end, it was Nimitz' use of these important men that ultimately won the war for the United States. <br /> <br />This book, written by historian Edwin P. Hoyt, does a fine job of explaining the transition of the U.S. Navy from a weakened and busted fleet early in the war to the offensive juggernaut that it became by the time of Japan's surrender.  Each important naval battle is discussed, and the role of Nimitz and his commanders is explained.  Form the dark days of January 1942 to the ultimate victory in September 1945, Nimitz' navy fought the Japanese tooth and nail, and, more often than not, came out on top.  The book also discusses the inter-service rivalries that existed between the Army and Navy, as well as the rise of the \\"young turks\\", or the Naval Aviator Flag Officers.  I recommend this book very highly.  It does a very good job of explaining Nimitz' role in the Pacific war, as well as that of his commanders.  Read it and learn about one of the greatest commanders and leaders our country has ever had.	2005-02-24

Eight of the Marines' twelve F4F Wildcat fighters were either destroyed outright or damaged so badly as to be unflyable.  For the next fifteen days, the Marines and civilians endured daily bombing raids.  On December 11, the Japanese tried an amphibious landing, but this was beat back by the defenders at tremendous loss to the Japanese.  Three destroyers were sunk, a light cruiser heavily damaged, and hundreds of Japanese sailors and Marines were killed.  However, this action only offered a brief respite for the Wake defenders, for on December 23, the Japanese returned in much greater numbers and successfully landed on Wake. <br /> <br />After much savage fighting in which the Americans inflicted much greater losses on the Japanese than they suffered themselves, Commander Winfield Scott Cunningham, perhaps somewhat prematurely, decided to surrender to the Japanese.  Major Devereux was in charge of passing the surrender order to the surprised and angry Marines.  Many contimplated mutiny and threatened to continue to fight, but in the end, all surrendered to the Japanese.  This surrender began the defenders' three and one half years as POWs. <br /> <br />In no greater battle have the Marines fought so bravely against such unbelieveable odds.  These men held out for fifteen long and stressful days against an enemy who was better equipped and more numerous than themselves.  The amount of damage they were able to inflict on the Japanese is staggering considering there were less than 500 Marines on Wake.  It is a true testament to their skill and desire to survive that they held out for so long. <br /> <br />This book gives a unique look at the battle as told by the members of the Wake Marines.  The stories are heroic and horrific at the same time.  Many of these men charged into battle with little regard for thier own lives.  Their only objective was to stop the Japanese, which they did very effectively.  The story of the Japanese POW atrocities brings to light the mistreatment that these brave Americans were forced to endure for forty four months of captivity.  Surviving on very little food and water, these men survived on sheer will and determination.  The acts of cruelty that the Japanese took out on these men is simply unforgivable.  Its no wonder that so many of these brave Marines called the Atomic Bombs an act of deliverance.  If not for their use, they would have been forced to endure a much longer time at the hands of the sadistic Japanese. <br /> <br />I found this to be a very interesting and eye opening book.  Many historians can write about a particular battle, but the only way to get a true sense of how it REALLY was to be there is to hear it from the survivors themselves.  These heroic men tell their tales in graphic detail.  Each aspect of the battle is described; from the initial bombing to the thwarted invaision, to the surrender.  These men were the first heroes of the war.  Their heroic example served as a benchmark for all future battles.  It is a testament to their will to survive and thier guts that they managed to hold out so long.  Read this well-written book and learn first-hand what it was like to face the Japanese and slap them in the face.	2005-02-08
US	50555753	R1GH22L0QUWQ1H	0553802577	767640279	The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors: The Extraordinary World War II Story of the U.S. Navy's Finest Hour	Books	5	7	7	N	N	A Thrilling Story of Courage and Heroism	James D. Hornfischer has vividly brought to life one of the shining moments of the U.S. Navy in World War II in this excellent book.  In October, 1944, the Americans began landing at Leyte Gulf to begin their push to re-take the Philippines.  General Douglas MacArthur's vital transport ships were unloading men and supplies, but the Japanese had devised a plan to trap the lightly-armed transports in a pincher movement, destroy the American beachhead, and deal a devastating blow to the invasion plans.   <br /> <br />The success of the Japanese plans hinged on Admiral William Halsey, commander of the mighty 3rd fleet, taking the bait that the Japanese had left for him.  Japanese Admiral Ozawa had positioned his carriers north of the Philippines with the hope of drawing Halsey and his fast carriers and battleships away from Leyte so two other powerful Japanese fleets approaching through Surigao Strait and San Bernadino Strait could link up and destroy the now unprotected American beachhead.  Halsey, always hungry for a fight, fell for the trap and sped north to attack the Japanese flattops.  Unknown to him, the Japanese had flown virtually all of their planes off the carriers, leaving them virtually empty and of little value anyway.  Halsey's terrible blunder left San Bernadino Strait wide open for the hard-charging Admiral Kurita and his battleships and cruisers.  The only American ships in his way were six \\"jeep\\" carriers, along with some destroyers and destroyer escorts.  But these brave little ships would put up a fight the likes the navy had never seen before and save MacArthur's beachhead in the process. <br /> <br />For over two hours, the tiny American armada slugged it out with the vastly superior Japanese force.  Surviving by improvisation, the Americans attacked with makeshift weapons and uncommon valor.   The brave little destroyers and destroyer escorts charged unafraid into the teeth of the enemy fleet to get close enough to launch their torpedoes at the enemy.  Under the brilliant guidance of Admiral Clifton \\"Ziggy\\" Sprague, the Americans held off the Japanese fleet while the escort carriers made good their escape.  The cost of this battle was high, as the Americans lost five ships and over one thousand sailors, but their heroic actions saved MacArthur's vital beachhead from Japanese attack. <br /> <br />This is an excellent book, and the battle is described in very vivid detail.  Drawing on eyewitness accounts and interviews from both American and Japanese sources, as well as many declassified documents, James Hornfischer puts the reader right in the heart of battle.  The uncommon valor of these heroic men is etched on every page, and the action is non-stop.  I highly recommend this fine work of naval history.  Read it and get an idea of what it was like to charge headlong into battle against overwhelming odds as well as capturing the true essence of heroism, loyalty, and honor.	2005-01-28

So many more characters have been introduced that I've completely lost track, except for the main characters, of course.  There are now so many that I simply scan right over the new ones. <br /> <br />As for the activites of the characters, Rand is on the brink of going insane while continuing his battle against the Seanchan, who have overrun Ebou Dar and are now threatening Rand's armies.   The Bowl of the Winds has been used and the drought that had covered the lands has been replaced by thunder, lightning, rain, and even snow.  Egwene continues to develop her hold as the real Amyrlin as she heads toward Tar Valon and her confrontation with Elaida.  Nynaeve and Elayne continue on toward the Lion Throne while trying to evade the Seanchan at the same time. <br /> <br />I had a difficult time maintaining my interest while reading this book.  There were several times where I read many pages, but I had no idea what had happened.  The introduction of so many new characters has made it very difficult to keep track of who's who, and thus the overall plot of the series has suffered.  The great cyclical nature of the entire series has been frustrating as well.  Just when the reader thinks that the series is picking up, another dud such as this book comes along and sets the whole series back.  I will read the final two books of the series, and I can only hope that the roller coaster will swing back up again.	2005-01-10

There have been definite peaks and valleys, and, after suffering through a valley with \\"Lord of Chaos\\", the series has taken another rise in this installment.   <br /> <br />Several sub-plots are playing themselves out in this volume, including Rand's successful escape from his imprisonment by the Aes Sedai and his subsequent removal of Colavaere Saighan from the Sun Throne.  After her removal, Rand banishes her to a farm, but she ends up hanging herself. <br /> <br />Lan, Moiraine's former warder, has returned and has married Nynaeve.   <br /> <br />Nynaeve, Elayne, and Mat are continuing their search for the Bowl of the Winds, a ter'angreal which may be able to reverse the endless heat wave which has been covering the world and restore the world's natural weather. <br /> <br />Finally, the Seanchan have come back and are attacking Ebou Dar. <br /> <br />Some interesting new charatcters, such as the Asha'man, men who have come to the Black Tower in order to learn how to channel, have appeared in this volume. <br /> <br />I found this book to be better than book six was.  Overall, I've enjoyed the series as a whole, but there has been little consistency from one book to the next.  Aside from books one and two, the qualtiy of each following volume has changed with each ensuing installment; one book would be good, and the next would be not so good.

Henry C. Clausen, a San Francisco lawyer with his own practice, was appointed by Secretary of War Henry Stimson to conduct a thorough investigation of the Pearl Harbor disaster after it was discovered that there may have been some tainted testimony with the recently completed Army Pearl Harbor Board investigation.  Armed with \\"Magic\\" decrypts in a \\"bomb pouch\\" which Clausen was to detonate if captured, he set off to take affidavits from the key personnel involved in the Pearl Harbor disaster. <br /> <br />According to the book, from November, 1944 to September, 1945, Clausen traveled more than 55,000 miles and interviewed over one hundred U.S. and British Army, Navy, and civilian personnel.  Clausen had the authority from Stimson to go anywhere and interview anyone under oath from enlisted personnel up to General George C. Marshall.  After completing his investigation, Clausen presented an 800 page report which revealed a massive failure by the United States to use the intelligence obtained months before the Pearl Harbor attack. <br /> <br />The crux of Clausen's investigation centered on the failure of the Army and Navy to share intelligence.  It was the Navy's responsibility to share their intelligence with the Army, but, according to Clausen's investigation, this did not happen.  Clausen also faulted Admiral Kimmel and General Short for failing to correctly interpret Washington's war warning message dated November 27, 1941.  Among the other charges leveled by Clausen against Kimmel and Short were Kimmel's failure to share intelligence with the Army and his own staff, while Short was charged with failing to defend the fleet, failing to adequately prepare to assume command in Hawaii, failing to alert his forces of the probability of a surprise attack, failing to conduct reconnaissance, and failing tocommunicate effectively with Kimmel. <br /> <br />Clausen names others who were responsible in his investigation, from Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner's attempt to take over Naval intelligence and assuming that Pearl Harbor had a \\"Purple\\" machine, to Fleet Intelligence Officer Edwin Layton, who failed to keep the Army abreast of intelligence developments by not following Kimmel's directive to deliver intelligence to the Army in person.  Others are listed as well, but these four men, especially Kimmel and Short, bear much of the responsibility for Pearl Harbor, according to Clausen. <br /> <br />Clausen was called as a witness before the Congressional hearings to testify about his findings.  He did a masterful job of handling the committee's questions, and managed to sway the thinking of several of the committee members. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this fine book.  Written in the first person by Clausen himself, he takes the reader on an incredible journey that uncovered many falsehoods and half-truths while, in my opinion, accurately identifying the persons directly responsible for the disaster at Pearl Harbor.  The only part of the book where I felt Clausen spent too much time on was the \\"Winds\\" message.  He admitted himself that he devoted perhaps too much time to this one issue, but this is a minor point which does not take anything away from the book.  Colonel Clausen did his country a remarkable service by completing such a fine investigation.  His methods were precise and produced the desired results.  I believe that Clausen's report accurately identifed who was to blame for the attack.  There is an excellent appendix section in the book which contains many of the \\"Magic\\" intercepts which Clausen used in his investigation.  Read this excellent work of history and find out who was responsible for the attack on Pearl Harbor.	2004-11-30

Intelligence showed that the Japanese were building an airfield on the island of Guadalcanal, located in the Solomon Islands.  If the Japanese were allowed to complete construction of this airfield, they would be in position to threaten Australia and vital American supply lines.  The joint chiefs, in July, 1942, made Guadalcanal their target.  In the next six months, some of the most ferocious fighting of the Pacific war would occur, but one battle turned the tide and assured that Guadalcanal would not be re-captured by the Japanese.  That battle became known as the battle for Bloody Ridge. <br /> <br />Bloody Ridge is an area of high ground about one mile from Henderson Field, the re-named airstrip which the Americans captured when they initially landed on Guadalcanal.  Whoever held the high area would control the airstrip.  For three bloody days in September, 1942, the Japanese and Americans fought ferociously and fanatically for control of the ridge. <br /> <br />The Japanese outnumbered the American marines approximately three to one, but the marines, led by such men as General Alexander Vandegrift and Colonel Merritt \\"Red Mike\\" Edson, held out and defended the ridge against these overwhelming odds.  In the final analysis provided by author Michael S. Smith, it was imperative for the Americans to hold the ridge, for in Smith's opinion, a Japanese victory would have meant certain re-capture of the airstrip by the Japanese.  Loss of the airstrip would have been disasterous for the Americans.  The certain destruction of the American aircraft by the Japanese would have left the Americans defenseless in the air, but, fortunately for the Americans, they proved that they could defeat the famous Japanese jungle fighting soldier. <br /> <br />This is an excellent book.  Author Michael S. Smith not only provides analysis of the American side, but he also goes in-depth in his analysis of the Japanese as well.  He paints a vivid picture of the ordeals faced by both sides, such as lack of sufficient food and ammunition, as well as providing expert analysis of both Japanese and American plans for battle.  The maps, tables, and photographs presented throughout the book were of great assistance for me in following the flow of the battle.  I highly recommend this book.  Read it and discover how a group of under-fed, low on ammunition American marines managed to hold off a superior Japanese force and ultimately turn the tide of battle in their favor.	2004-11-18

Despite being spotted on four different occasions by Allied forces, these Japanese ships managed to achieve complete surprise on the unsuspecting Allied forces covering the entrance to Savo Sound.  In the span of eight minutes, four Allied heavy cruisers (USS Astoria, USS Vincennes, USS Quincy, and HMAS Canberra) were sunk by the Japanese, whose expertise at night fighting and the use of torpedoes became painfully clear to the Allies on this night. <br /> <br />Why were the Japanese so successful and why were the Allies caught so completely by surprise?  There are several factors.  First, the Japanese cruisers carried torpedo tubes while the Allied cruisers did not.  The Japanese used their torpedoes with deadly accuracy, while the Allies had to rely on guns alone.  Second, the ultimate failure of the command structure of the Allied forces played a large part in the defeat.  The Japanese force was spotted on its approach at least four times.  Each time, the sughting was inaccurately described, or the message never reached those in charge of the ships.  Also, the overall commander of the Allied forces, Admiral Crutchley, failed to notify the commanders of the other ships that he was removing his flagship, the HMAS Australia, from the group.  This left no one in overall command.  The cruiser captains were forced to fend for themselves.  These factors, plus an overwhelming desire by the Japanese to succeed, led to the disaster at Savo Island.  Had the Japanese continued the fight and attacked the American transports which were unloading off of Guadalcanal, the disaster would have been much worse for the Allies. <br /> <br />Author Richard F. Newcomb does a very good job describing this great loss for the Allies.  He describes the intrepid Japanese Admiral Mikawa, who decided to attack the Americans, as well as all of the sightings of his force by the Allies.  Perhaps his best work in this book is how he describes the action on each Allied cruiser, devoting a separate chapter to the Astoria, Vincennes, Quincy, and Canberra.  A good follow-up to the battle is also provided at the end of the book. <br /> <br />I recommend this book.  It does a good job of describing one of the darkest days of the United States Navy and the lessons which were learned from the defeat.  These lessons led ultimaely to the defeat of Japan.	2004-11-14

The story begins with four army chaplains, each of different faiths, being placed aboard the U.S. troop ship Dorchester. Chaplain George Fox was a World War I hero who had recieved wounds that had not completely healed.  Nevertheless, he volunteered to serve again in World War II.  Chaplain Alexander Goode had a dream of uniting all people of all faiths.  It was this drive for universal harmony that led him to enlist.  Chaplain Clark Poling, the son of a famous evangelist, loved football and the spiritual world.  He even had a conversation with God on a mountaintop, much like Moses.  He enlisted to share his beliefs and enthusiasm with others.  Finally, Chaplain John Washington, a priest from a struggling family, faked an eye exam so he would be allowed to serve.  These brave men left behind wives and children so they could follow their heavenly calling to minister to our fighting men overseas.    God must have had a plan for each of the chaplains, as if by providence, each was assigned to the Dorchester.  While on their way to Greenland, the Dorchester was forced to pass through an area known as \\"Torpedo Junction\\"; an area with a high concentration of German U-Boats.  Shortly after midnight on the night of February 3, 1943, the German submarine U-223 launched three torpedos at the small convoy that the Dorchester was in.  One of the torpedoes slammed into the side of the Dorchester.  In a matter of minutes, the Dorchester had taken on a sharp list and was surely going to sink.    During this time, the four chaplains were passing out life jackets (even their own) and giving the men encouragement as the order to abandon ship was given.  But a huge problem faced the men.  The water temperature was barely above freezing, andafter a period of about twenty minutes, hypothermia would set in.  Many of the men had not followed the earlier order to put on their heavy clothes and lifejackets, so they had on only shorts and t-shirts as they went over the side.  The chaplains, seemingly having made up their minds to remain on board, continued to provide encouragement and assistance until the Dorchester slid beneath the waves approximately 45 minutes after the torpedo hit.  The chaplains, linked arm and arm and voices raised to heaven, went down with the ship, but not after each chaplain had surrendered their own life jacket so some other terrified soldier might live.    The task of rescuing the survivors fell upon the coast guard cutters screening the convoy.  However, due to a procedural order, the cutters were not able to begin rescuing survivors immediately, for fear that the German submarine may still be in the area.  Most of the men who died in the water passed away during this interval between the sinking and the beginning of rescue operations.  Finally, the order was given to begin rescue, but by this time, the men had been exposed to the wind and water for almost an hour.  Most had already died.  This was a grievous error in not allowing the cutters to begin rescue earlier.  As it was, the survivors who did make it were barely clinging to life with frozen arms, legs, and feet.  Approximately 200 survivors were pulled from the icy water.    I've read numerous books about ship sinkings and rescues during World War II, and this book is definitely one of the best I've read.  The chaplains' story  and the sinking of the Dorchester is told in great detail, and the memories of the survivors make the reading that much more insightful.  I give this book my highest recommendation.  Read this book and discover the true story of four ordinary people who, through their trust in God, saved the souls of many others.	2004-11-09

Born and raised in Las Vegas, Jenna Massoli, at the tender age of sixteen, began frequenting tattoo parlors and hanging out with a very surly crowd.  One person, Jack, befriended Jenna and soon they were going out together.  However, on a trip to Jack's uncle's yacht, Jenna gets raped.  This incident started a chain reaction in her life which led to drug abuse, rebellion, and ultimately her entrance into the world of pornography. <br /> <br />In the years that followed her encounter on the yacht, Jenna rose up the ladder of the adult film business at a skyrocketing pace.  She started out dancing in clubs, but graduated to magazine layouts and ultimately adult films, while leaving a path of broken relationships (both male and female) in her wake. Jenna's true wish was to find a person she could settle down with and have a family, but it seemed that every relationship she entered into turned sour and ended with huge fights and nasty breakups.  The drug abuse grew, and she developed a serious eating disorder.  In the end, she was able to overcome her addictions and find someone she truly loved. <br /> <br />I found this book to be a thought-provoking look inside the adult film and entertainment industry.  Jenna gives a no-holds-barred narrative about the business itself and about her own personal life and struggles to make something of herself.  She describes each awful relationship she entered into, along with her encounters with such celebrities as Bruce Willis, Tommy Lee, and Howard Stern.  Jenna is now recognized as the top female porn star in history.  I give this book a very high recommendation.  Jenna's story is both exciting and funny at the same time, and you'll find yourself laughing and sympathizing with her.  Read this book and watch the life of an adult film actress unfold.	2004-11-04

Unknown to Grianne, the Straken has released his own creature into the Four Lands to break down the barrier which holds the Jarka Ruus inside thier prison.  Will Grianne find a way to stop the creature, or will she remain trapped inside the Forbidding along with the Straken Lord? <br /> <br />Pen Ohmsford, Khyber, Cinnaminson, and Tagwen are continuing their search for the Tanequil, an ancient tree that, if persuaded, will give up one of its branches to be made into a darkwand which will allow Pen to pass over into the Forbidding to rescue his trapped aunt.  However, the group has numerous run-ins with nasty creatures and Shadea a'Ru's druids before finally reaching the Tanequil.  Will the price the Tanequil requires be too great for Pen to pay? <br /> <br />Bek and Rue, Pen's parents, have been told by Shadea's druids of the disappearance of their son and have been told to come to Paranor to begin searching for him.  However, Shadea has her own plans to use Bek and Rue to lure her to Pen before he can reach Grianne.  Bek learns of this plan, but Shaeda discovers that Bek is using his magic to find Pen, and she throws both Bek and Rue into her dungeons.  Will Rue and Bek escape, or will they remain locked away in Paranor? <br /> <br />Sen Dunsidan, Prime Minister of the Federation, has developed a new and frightening weapon to be used against the Free Born in an effort to break the twenty year stalemate of their war against one another.  Will this weapon succeed, or will the Elves, led by a new hero, defeat the Federation? <br /> <br />Hopefully, all of these questionswill be answered in book three.  I found \\"Tanequil\\" to be one of Terry Brooks' best works.  Brooks has a gift of narration and scene setting for the reader that is unsurpassed by other fantasy writers.  I found myself on edge with every passing page due to the excellent narrative provided by Brooks.  His storytelling is definitely his strong point, and it is most assuredly on display in this fine book.  Needless to say, I give this excellent book my highest recommendation.  After reading this, I'll have a hard time waiting an entire year for the final book in the series, but the wait will be worth it, because I'm sure it will be just as good, if not better, than this book is.	2004-10-28
US	50555753	R24HVBJRLEBHS9	0451208730	411917543	Pacific Alamo: The Battle for Wake Island	Books	5	9	12	N	N	Remember Wake!	In this fine book about the heroic struggle for Wake Island, author John Wukovits describes in great detail the heroic stand made by a handful of Marines and their civilian counterparts against a vastly superior foe.  Mere hours after the Japanese had successfully attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbor, bombs began falling Wake.  Unfortunately for the Americans, this first attack destroyed eight out of VMF-211's twelve Wildcat fighters.  But what was to occur over the next two weeks has gone down in the anals of Marine lore as one of their finest hours, for this small group of Marines and their civilian counterparts held out against vastly superior forces, while inflicting tremendous damage on the over-confident Japanese. <br /> <br />On December 11, 1941, the Japanese tried their first amphibious assault against the Wake garrison.  Major Devereux, commander of the Wake Marines, told his gunners to hold their fire until the ships got well within range of their five inch guns.  Once in range, the Marines unleashed salvo after salvo on the completely surprised Japanese.  Two destroyers were sunk, a light cruiser was heavily damaged, and the invasion attempt was repelled. <br /> <br />However, the Marines and their civilian construction worker counterparts were unable to celebrate their victory for long, because the Japanese were still delivering their daily air raids against the island.  Little by little, the bombers took their toll on the remnants of the Wake air force.  Soon, only one of Major Paul Putnam's fighters was able to fly, and the men, suffering from lack of food and sleep, were beginning to show signs of wearing down.  To make matters worse for the defenders, a relief force organized at Pearl Harbor by Admiral Kimmel was ordered to turn around by Kimmel's interim replacement, Admiral Pye.  Pye took over for Kimmel when he was relieved of his command, and he feared that the rescue attempt would cost the navy more ships that it could afford to lose.  Regardless, men aboard the ships could not believe that the force was being recalled and many men contimplated mutiny to keep the task force heading for Wake.  Admiral Pye was never to hold another sea command during the war. <br /> <br />The Japanese finally made a successful landing on Wake on December 23.  The Marines and civilians, after holding out for two weeks, were now faced with fighting the enemy on land.  Despite the fact that they were greatly outnumbered, the Marines and civilians fought like caged animals, and on Wilkes island, actually had the Japanese on the run.  However, an overly cautious Commander Winfield S. Cunningham, believing that there was no way to repel the invaders, ordered the island to be surrendered.  Upon receiving Cunningham's order from Major Devereux, many of the men believed that a mistake had been made.  The Americans had killed many more Japanese than they had lost of their own, and the Japanese that were still on the island were being routed by the Marines.  However, the order stood, and the gallant Marines and civilians followed the surrender order and laid down their arms. <br /> <br />After the surrender, the Marines and some of the civilians were loaded aboard a transport ship and moved to POW camps in China and Japan.  Some of the civilians remained behind to finish work on the projects that had been started before the war, but now they were working for the Japanese.  In 1943, after an American bombardment of Wake, the Japanese commander became so infuriated that he ordered the remaining civilians rounded up and executed.  The commander was executed in 1947. <br /> <br />After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Wake islanders were finally allowed to go back to the United States.  Some men adjusted to civilian life rather easily, while others struggled with nightmares and physical ailments until they died.  But no matter wich group they fell into, these men were heroes.  They provided a glimmer of hope for the folks back home during the dark early days of the war, and, by their example, the American people knew then that we would win in the end. <br /> <br />This book offers a fine account of bravery under fire and uncommon valor.   The story of Wake's defenders is told in vivid detail, and nothing is left out.  Each chapter is ripe with stories of heroics and acts above and beyond the call of duty.  From the opening shot on December 8, 1941 until the last man returned home in 1945, John Wukovits covers every aspect of the battle for Wake and the struggle these heroic men faced on a daily basis.  Written with grace and conviction, the story of Wake comes alive in this book.  I highly recommend this fine work  of military history.  The contents are fascinating and the story incredible.  Read this fine book and learn about some of the first true heroes of World War II.	2004-10-13
US	50555753	R3W1PNPFT3G73M	1585746436	226392454	The Men of the Gambier Bay: The Amazing True Story of the Battle of Leyte Gulf	Books	5	15	17	N	N	Brave Ship, Brave Crew	By June 1942, it had become clear to the U.S. Navy that some type of smaller aircraft carrier would be needed to provide antisubmarine protection as well as air support for troops on the islands of the Pacific.  Thus, the concept of the \\"baby flattop\\" or \\"jeep carrier\\" was born. <br /> <br />These carriers were built on converted liberty ship hulls.  Their flight decks were a little less than 500 feet long, or about 350 to 400 feet shorter than that of a fleet carrier such as the Essex or Enterprise class.  The Gambier Bay was one of these small carriers. <br /> <br />This informative book by noted historian Edwin P. Hoyt describes the brief life of the U.S.S. Gambier Bay and her dedicated crew of sailors, officers, and pilots.  After her commissioning in December, 1943, the Gambier Bay sailed for the hostile waters of the Pacific.  Her first mission was to ferry replacement planes to the larger fleet carriers, but the battles in the Pacific were growing in size, and more ships were needed for actual fighting.  The Gambier Bay soon found herself in the midst of the fighting. <br /> <br />Her first real action took place during the Marianas campaign in the summer of 1944.  During this battle, the Japanese lost over 350 planes in what has become known as \\"The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot\\".  The Gambier Bay's fighter contingent gave a good account of themselves in this battle by downing enemy planes and flying sorties against enemy shipping. <br /> <br />By the fall of 1944, the objective had shifted to MacArthur's return to the Philippines, and once again, the Gambier Bay was called upon for her services.  Formed into a larger group of other escort carriers, the Gambier Bay and her sisters were to guard the American beachhead on Leyte from enemy attack.  There would be no help from the battleships or fleet carriers, as Admiral Halsey fell for a Japanese trap and headed north to pursue the Japanese flattops.  The Japanese flew their planes off their carriers to land bases, but Halsey couldn't resist the urge to chase after the now planeless flattops.  Halsey has been criticized for this decision for years, because he left the invasion beaches wide open to Japanese attack while he was off chasing carriers which were virtually harmless. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, a large force of Japanese cruisers and battleships were steaming through the San Bernardino Strait directly for the American transports.  The only ships in their way were the Gambier Bay and her fellow baby flattops.  The actions of these ships can only be described as heroic, as the baby flattops, their planes, and the escorting destroyers held the much larger Japanese fleet away from the beaches with timely air and torpedo strikes.  However, Several Japanese cruisers managed to get close enough to the American fleet to begin firing shells, and the Gambier Bay, being nearest to the Japanese ships, became the focal point of their attack.  The little carrier was raked for over an hour by Japanese shells, and finally, the brave ship rolled over and sank, the only American carrier to be sunk by gunfire during the war. <br /> <br />Many of the survivors had to spend up to three days in the water before they were rescued, due to faulty rescue procedures.  Unfortunately for the Americans, this would not be the last time during the war when a failed search and rescue would occur, for nine months after the sinking of the Gambier Bay, the U.S.S. Indianapolis was torpedoed, and the survivors had to deal with much the same obstacles as the survivors of the Gambier Bay did, including sharks, thirst, hunger, and hallucinations. <br /> <br />The crew members who did survive were finally rescued and put aboard destroyers for their journey back to Leyte.  Many of the survivors were sent back to the United States for leave before shipping out again as crewmembers on a different ship to continue the fight against the Japanese. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book very much.  From her launching until her sinking, the Gambier Bay and her crew fought bravely in each engagement they were involved in.  I especially liked the way Mr. Hoyt devoted a chapter each to the captain, crew, pilots, and ship herself.  The battles which the Gambier Bay participated in are described in great detail, but the author does an especially good job describing the Battle of Leyte Gulf and the plight of the survivors after the sinking.  I give this book my highest recommendation.  Read it and learn about a heroic ship and her crew and how they put up such a brilliant fight against a much stronger enemy.	2004-10-07

With the last two books, the action was fast-paced and there was very little  down-time, but Jordan reverts to his long -windedness again in this book. <br /> <br />As for the characters, Rand, The Dragon Reborn, has started a school to train men how to channel.  He has also sent Mat and his group to find Elayne and bring her safely to Andor so she can assume the Sun Throne in place of her mother, Morgase.  (By the way, what exactly happened to Morgase?) <br /> <br />Egwyne and Nynaeve have been risen to full Aes Sedai, with Egwyne being risen to the Amyrlin Seat of the Salidar Aes Sedai.  The Tar Valon group of the Aes Sedai still recognize Eladia as their Amyrlin Seat.  Nynaeve has also discovered how to heal stilling, and she cures Siuan, the former Amyrlin who was stilled by Eladia and her cohorts. <br /> <br />The Salidar Aes Sedai and the Tar Valon Aes Sedai are both interested in Rand, and Eladia is determined to have him before the Salidar group.  Her group does indeed sieze Rand, and they put him in a cage to be returned to Tar Valon. <br /> <br />Perrin, Faile, and Loial are all brought back in this volume after being left out since book four.  I was happy to see these characters returned to the story,as they are some of my favorites. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the series has slowed down a little again with this book.  The series slowed down after book three, but picked up again with books four and five.  I was disappointed with this book, and I would rate it as only average.  I found myself struggling at times to get through it, and I was glad when I finally finished it.  Hopefully, book seven will re-energize the series the way book four did.	2004-09-29
US	50555753	R31R2LYMYJPNN6	0393049248	648234425	The Eagle and the Rising Sun: The Japanese-American War 1941-1943: Pearl Harbor through Guadalcanal	Books	4	7	8	N	N	The Early Battles of the Pacific War	This book describes the period from Pearl Harbor through Guadalcanal, while also providing information on the Japanese invasion of China, as well as the various arms confernces of the 1920s and 30s. <br /> <br />During this early phase of the Pacific war, the Japanese achieved victory after victory, while the United States and her Allies struggled to stop the rising tide of Japanese victories.  From Wake to the Java Sea, the Japanese Army and Navy ruled supreme while the Allies lost countless numbers of men, planes, and ships. <br /> <br />For six months, the Japanese never lost, but in June, 1942, at the Battle of Midway, the Japanese advance was stopped.  Four Japanese carriers were sunk, and many planes and men were lost which coluld not be replaced.  Japan would never regain the offensive again. <br /> <br />This book has both its high points and low points.  Among the high points is the very informative narration about the Japanese invasion of mainland China in the early 1930s.  This is where the Japanese \\"Bushido\\" code was developed.  Unfortunately for the Allied POWs, they found out first-hand how this horrible code worked.  The background information about each principal player in the Pacific War was also helpful.  From Yamamoto to Nimitz, Author Alan Schom provides good background information to help the reader understand these personalities and how they fought. <br /> <br />There are also some poor points in the book, too.  For example, the heroic struggle for Wake Island in the days following the Pearl Harbor raid is barely mentioned.  These heroic civilians and marines were the first true heroes of the Pacific war.  They deserve more attention than they received from Schom.  The battles of the Coral Sea and Midway are given just thumbnail sketches as well.  More detail could have been given in these areas as well.  However, the author does a god job describing the battle of Guadalcanal. <br /> <br />I do think this is a worthwhile read.  The background information on the Japanese invasion of China is very good, as is the information on the Japanese and Allied commanders.  However, I wish the author would have given due recognition and more information on some of the crucial battles of this period of the Pacific war.	2004-08-16
US	50555753	R2MJY14IS3SP3U	0553803026	181608296	Given Up for Dead: America's Heroic Stand at Wake Island	Books	5	16	18	N	N	The Alamo of the Pacific	The heroic defenders of Wake Island have often been compared to the band of soldiers who defended the Alamo , and in this fine book, author Bill Sloan describes the battle for Wake Island from early on December 8 until the Marines finally and grudgingly surrendered to the overwhelming Japanese forces on December 23, 1941. <br /> <br />The first bombs began to fall on Wake just five hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Eight of the twelve aircraft from Marine fighter squadron VMF-211 were destroyed on the ground and the airfield was left pot-holed, but the Marines' spirit was never broken.  A few days later, the Japanese tried an amphibious landing, but the Marines, led by Major James Devereux, succeeded in replusling the invasion attempt.  Wake had three twin batteries of five inch naval guns, and these batteries succeeded in sinking two Japanese destroyers and heavily damaging a light cruiser and several other ships. <br /> <br />For the next two weeks, the brave Marines endured daily bombing raids by the Japanese, but the Marine anti-aircraft gunners managed to put up a tremendous volume of flak and succeeded in downing several Japanese planes.  However, on the 22nd and 23rd of December, the Japanese, supported by two aircraft carrier groups detached from the returning Pearl Harbor strike force, managed to successfully land troops on Wake.  For the next few days, the Japanese faced the wrath of the greatly outnumbered Marines and civillian workers.  Japanese casualties were horrendous, while the greatly outnumbered Americans fought with bravery and gallantry right up until the controversial surrender order was given. <br /> <br />Many of the Marines on Wake thought the order must have been a mistake.  The Japanese were being pushed back into the sea at many points, but the overly conservative Commander Winfield Cunningham thought that there was no way to stop the advancing Japanese.  Many men contimplated mutiny and vowed to continue fighting the Japanese, but, in the end, the valiant Wake defenders surrendered to the Japanese after having inflicted many more casualties on the enemy than they suffered.  These heroic defenders were now condemned to finish the war as prisoners of the Japanese. <br /> <br />I've read dozens of books about the Pacific war, and this is one of the best I've read.  Bill Sloan has done an amazing job in bringing the heroic struggle for Wake to life.  The book reads like a novel, and I definitely felt like I came to know each Marine mentioned in the book.  Sloan tells it all; from the American's decision to turn Wake into a military base in the late 1930's, the attack by the Japanese, the aborted rescue mission by an American task force in which many American airmen came dangerously close to mutiny, and to the final surrender.  I give this book my absolute highest recommendation.  From the day the Japanese landed until the surrender, the Marines fought with gritty determination against vastly superior forces, yet they didn't waiver in the face of battle.  This battle solidified the meaning of being a Marine.  Semper Fi.	2004-08-02

Although the information presented in the book is good, it is very basic and does not go into much detail. The information included in the book really only amounts to a thumbnail sketch, and the author seems to concentrate his discussion more on the shortcomings of General Short than Admiral Kimmel.<br /><br /> The author bases his arguments from information obtained from the several Pearl Harbor inquiries, mainly the Army and Navy board inquiries. For example, in the chapter entitled &quot;Accountability&quot;, each charge against Short is listed, along with an analysis of the response of Short. What perplexed me is why a similar approach was not taken in regards to Admiral Kimmel? I felt that by reading this book, much of Admiral Kimmel's story was omitted.<br /><br /> There are some interesting parts of the book, however. The author presents compelling evidence about the inter-service rivalries that existed between the Army and Navy, and how these rivalries directly lead to the disaster on December 7. Also, the failure to coordinate training and liasion activities between the two branches is effectively discussed.<br /><br /> Overall, I found this book to be interesting, but very basic. The information presented is good, but only the surface is scratched and the author doesn't go into great detail on any subject. I would recommend this as an introductory book, but there are other books about Pearl Harbor that discuss these same topics in much greater detail than this one does.	2004-07-21

Months of stinging defeats coupled by the continuous bombing of the homeland had brought the Japanese to a state of near extinction.  Some factions of the Japanese were ready to surrender, citing the mounting losses from the American bombings, but most in the military favored continuing the war while preparing for the inevitable Allied invasion.  Japan would strike at the Allies with massed kamikaze attacks while fighting to the last man on the invasion beaches.<br />Meanwhile, the Americans had perfected the world's first atomic bombs.  After a successful test in the New Mexico desert, two bombs were shipped to the Marianas for eventual drops on Japan.  The first bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, while the second was dropped on Nagasaki.  Even after the atomic bombings, Japan refused to surrender.  The Japanese were still holding out for the final battle on the Japanese mainland.  However, Hirohito and members of his cabinet were discussing the acceptance of the Potsdam Decleration, the Allied message to Japan stating the Allies would only accept unconditional surrender from the Japanese.  This caused the Japanese great concern, for they wanted the freedom to disarm their own troops, prosecute their own war criminals, maintain the emperor, and have no Allied occupation.  All of these terms were considered unallowable by the Allies.<br />At the same time, Russia had entered the war against the Japanese, and they were sweeping through Manchuria with their sights set on Northern Japan and a chance at being allowed as part of the post-war occupation force.  The Allies wanted to avoid this possibility.<br />After a moratorium on bombing raids over Japan, the raids began again.  Since most important targets had been destroyed, the target selected was the Akita Oil Company refinery in Northern Japan.  Was this a coincedence, or did the Americans specifically select this target so it wouldn't fall to the Russians in the event they advanced into Northern Japan?<br />Radar picked up the B-29s as they were heading North, and a total blackout of Tokyo was ordered.  It was feared by the Japanese that the Allies were prepared to drop a third atomic bomb on Tokyo, thus the city was blacked out.  It just so happened that the blackout occurred precisely when the scheduled coup was supposed to start.  The main objective was to find the wax disks that Hirohito had used to make his surrender recording on.  The militants wanted to destroy these disks and make their own broadcast stating the continuance of the war.  However, due to the blackout, the militants had a very difficult time finding their way around the Imperial Palace, and the coup failed.  Hirohito's broadcast went on as planned.  Is it possible that this one final mission indirectly lead to the failure of the coup due to the blackout order?  There is compelling evidence in this book to support this argument.<br />I found this book to be good overall, but the title is a little misleading.  Most of the book deals with the coup plotting, while only a chapter or two actually deals with the &quot;last mission&quot;.  However, I did learn some things that I didn't know before.  I do recommend this book.  It contains excellent information on the coup, as well as the atomic bombings, and the information that is presented about the final  ission is interesting.  Read this book and learn about a turbulent period in August, 1945.	2004-07-15

It was decided that a thrust into the Central Pacific island groups of the Marshalls and Gilberts would be the objective, with the island of Tarawa in the Gilberts to be taken first.  What happened on that tiny island in the Central Pacific can only be described as some of the bloodiest fighting of the war and a near disaster for the Americans.<br />Tarawa is surrounded by a coral reef which reaches as much as a half mile out into the ocean.  Preliminary reports stated that the tide should have been high enough for the invasion fleet to successfully navigate over the reef, but the reports proved to be wrong.  Much of the reef was exposed, so men were forced to wade in chest-deep water up to a half mile to the beach while facing murderous Japanese fire.<br />The pre-invasion bombardment of the island destroyed much of the above-ground buildings and outposts, but the Japanese had spend considerable time and labor constructing bunkers and pillboxes made from coral, logs, and concrete so strong that only a direct hit from a heavy bomb or shell could successuflly knock them out.  These positions proved to be deadly for the Americans, as many were constructed to provide covering fire for other positions.  <br />Once ashore, the Americans faced a fanatical enemy who refused to surrender.  Many Japanese were literally burned alive by flamethrowers or blown to bits by grenades.<br />The losses of the battle were horrific for both sides.  The Japanese lost virtually every man, while the casualties the Americans suffered were unlike any ever seen, and only matched by Iwo Jima and Okinawa.  A battle that was supposed to last but a few hours turned into a week-long struggle for survival.<br />I felt this book did a good job of describing the decision to attack the Gilberts and Marshalls, and the description of the battle for both sides was well done.  The quotesfrom veterans were essential to understanding the true essence of the battle, and the author supplies many quotes throughout the book.  I recommend this book.  It gives a good basic description of one of the bloodiest battles the Americans fought against the Japanese and the lessons learned from it.	2004-06-28

Jordan builds on the momentum he captured in book four (\\"The Shadow Rising\\"), and the storyline and character development continue in TFOH.<br />As for the main characters, each is facing new and exciting challenges in this book.  Rand is still dealing with the realization that he is The Dragon Reborn.  He has rallied the Aiel clan chiefs in a massive battle against the rebel Aiel chief Couladin, who claims that he is the true Dragon Reborn.  Couladin and his followers, the Shaido, meet the fury of Rand and the rest of the Aiel in a decisive and climactic battle.<br />Egwene, Elayne, and Nynaeve continue their pursuit of the Black Ajah.  Word has reached them that Siuan Sanche has been overthrown and stilled by Eladia.  The three have also learned that a group of Aes Sedai has decided to try to overthrow Eladia and reclaim the White Tower.<br />Mat, Lan, and Moiraine continue to travel with Rand.  Mat distinguishes himself in the battle with the Shaido by beheading Couladin.  Moiraine has decided to become more yielding to Rand, but this turns into disaster at the end of the book.<br />This book is the best of the series so far in my opinion.  The storyline and character development is very good, and the plot keeps the reader interested throughout the book. The last 200 pages of the book are some of Jordan's best work.  The ending of the book is a true cliffhanger and will leave the reader wondering what will happen next.  I'm looking forward to the next book in the series.  Hopefully, it will be as good as this one.	2004-06-07

Books	4	29	30	N	N	&quot;One of the Blackest Days in American Military History&quot;	On December 8, 1941, a scant ten hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, a large force of Japanese bombers and fighters crippled the largest force of four-engine B-17 bombers outside of the United States, as well as many of their P-40 support fighters.  This sudden blow allowed the Japanese to rule the sky over the Philippines, removing the only effective fighting force that might have opposed them in Southeast Asia.<br />How was this attack allowed to happen?  Why didn't General Douglas MacArthur, commander of all military forces in the Philippines, have his planes in the air, or even better, why wasn't he launching an attack against the Japanese bases on Formosa?  These questions have been asked almost as much as who was responsible for the Pearl Harbor attack, but what makes the Philippine disaster much worse is that MacArthur had ten hours' warning that the Japanese were probably going to strike but he failed to act!<br />General Brereton, MacArthur's air chief tried repeatedly to get clearance from MacArthur to launch an attack against Formosa, but each time he was told by MacArthur's chief of staff General Sutherland to stand by and not to use the B-17s offensively or even for reconnaissence without first obtaining Sutherland's permission.  By the time Brereton was finally allowed to mount a reconnaissence mission against Formosa, it was too late, the Japanese were already winging their way toward Clark Field. The B-17 attack against Formosa never occurred.<br />What happened on December 8, 1941 can only be described as a huge derelection of duty by Sutherland and MacArthur.  MacArthur should have sought out Brereton himself and devised a plan to attack Formoosa as soon as news of the Pearl Harbor attack was known, or, at the very least, Brereton should have been allowed to speak to MacArthur instead of receiving the run-around he got from Sutherland.<br />The results of the Japanese attack were devastating.  Almost half of the B-17 force in the Philippines was destroyed on the ground as well as many of the P-40 pursuit planes.  The Japanese, as at Pearl Harbor, suffered only minor losses.<br />I found this book to be a fascinating read.  Mr. Bartsch describes American involvement in the Philippines from the build-up (and Washington's fatal decision to put their faith in a long-range bomber force as a deterrant to Japan) right through to the attack on Clark Field.  Japanese and American viewpoints are presented, and the Epilogue solidifys Bartsch's case against MacArthur and Sutherland.  I highly recommend this fine book.  This subject has never really received the coverage it deserves, but this book describes in great detail one of the most destructive attacks against the United States.  The ironic part is that it all could have been prevented if MacArthur and his staff had reacted differently.	2004-05-04

Their mission: to destroy the remaining believers on earth and set up Carpathia's reign.  However, God has another plan for Nicolae and his army.  God sends his son Jesus to destroy Carpathia and his army while setting up his thousand year reign on earth.<br />The most special part of this book for me was when Jesus appeared in the clouds on his white horse along with all of the angels and prophets.  The &quot;voice&quot; of Jesus seemed to leap off the pages.  Jenkins' &quot;voice&quot; of Jesus and the resulting death of the G.C. soldiers at merely hearing His voice was extremely captivating to me as a reader.  The vivid descriptions of Carpathia's and Satan's destruction was awe-inspiring as well.<br />I've read other reviews of this series by people who claim that the writing and storyline has slowed down with each new book in the series, but that cannot be said about &quot;Glorious Appearing&quot;.  In my opinion, this book is the best of the series.  The writing is excellent, and the &quot;voice&quot; of Jesus makes the book that much better.  LaHaye and Jenkins did their best work with this book.<br />Having read each book in this series, I'm sorry that its now over, but I've learned much more about the Rapture, Tribulation, and Resurrection from reading this series.  The image I will remember most from this book occurs in the last three pages when Rayford, his family, and the rest of the Tribulation Force is reunited.  I can almost feel their joy and excitement.<br />I highly recommend this fine book.  You'll surely be drawn in just as I was.	2004-04-22

After struggling through &quot;Dragon&quot;, I found &quot;Shadow&quot; to be much more enjoyable to read.<br />There are many subplots going on at the same time in this book.  Rand, having declared himself the Dragon Reborn by removing Callandor from Tear, is trying to decide on what his next move will be.  Ultimately, he decides that there should be a conference of all the Aiel clan chiefs, so he proceeds to the city of Rhuidean, where he learns about the Aiel customs and practices, albeit in a rather strange manner.<br />Dain Bornhald, captain of the Children of the Light (Whitecloaks), is determined to avenge the death of his father, Geofram.  Dain believes that Perrin is responsible for the death of his father, so he leads his Children to the Two Rivers, home of Perrin, Mat, and Rand, where he is determined to face off against Perrin.<br />Elayne and Nynaeve are still pursuing the elusive Black Ajah, led by Black Aes Sedai Liandrin.  Their journey, where they discover the strange &quot;Sea Folk&quot;, takes them to the town of Tanchico, where their search continues. They are determined to find the Black Ajah before the Black Ajah can spring their trap they have prepared for Rand.<br />At the White Tower, rebel Aes Sedai, lead by Eladia, have overthrown Amyrlin Seat Siuan Sanche and stilled her.  Forced to flee the White Tower, Siuan, Min, and Leane set out into the wilderness.  How long will Siuan live?  Most Aes Sedai who are stilled don't live very long, but Siuan is determined to gain revenge on Eladia and her allies.<br />The only complaint I have about this book, and the reason for four stars, is the number of new characters that Jordan introduces.  There are so many now that I've found it hard to remember who everyone is, except for the characters that have appeared in all of the books so far.  However, I did think this book got the ball rolling again after book three's let down.  Let the Wheel of Time continue to turn.	2004-04-06

Perhaps the best thing about this book is that it contains so many curious George stories.  You could read a different story each night for several nights.  My children have quickly become as fond of George as I was when I was a child.  The accompanying illustrations are very colorful and they definitely grab a young child's attention.  I highly recommend this fine children's book.  It is a great book to share with your children and perhaps serve as a reminder to your own childhood.	2004-03-17

This battle turned out to be the turning point of the war for both sides.  For the Americans, they finally managed to stop the Japanese advance, while the Japanese suffered a crushing defeat and were put on the defensive, never to regain the offensive again.  One of the ships sunk in this momentous battle was the American aircraft carrier Yorktown.  This ship, the &quot;fighting lady&quot; as she was known to her crew, became the objective of undersea explorer Robert Ballard.<br />Ballard, who discovered the Titanic, Bismarck, and the lost fleet of Guadalcanal, journeyed to Midway to locate the sunken Yorktown.  What he managed to find was a ship in almost pristine condition.  The excellent photographs and drawings of the Yorktown contained in the book bring her back to life.  Resting in several thousand feet of water, the Yorktown looks in remarkably good condition.  The torpedo holes on her side are visible, but the flight deck and island are in very good condition.  Also included in the expedition were several Japanese survivors of the battle.  Ballard had hoped to locate the four Japanese carriers sunk during the battle, but he unfortunately could not locate them.<br />The book also describes in great detail the battle itself, and there are many actual photos from the battle contained in the book as well.  I have the video of the expedition entitled The Battle For Midway, and this book makes a fine companion to the video.  I highly recommend both the video and the book.  They do an excellent job describing one of the most important battles of the 20th century as well as bringing a &quot;fighting lady&quot; back to life.	2004-03-17
US	50555753	RDVXYYCX2TZSI	1585673978	253034337	The Destruction of the Bismarck	Books	4	8	11	N	N	The Sinking of Germany's Supership	In May, 1941, Germany unleashed a terror in the Atlantic; the battleship Bismarck.  At over 50,000 tons and armed with 15 inch main guns, the Bismarck was the most powerful battleship afloat at the time.  Germany's objective was to unleash the Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen in the Atlantic through the Denmark Strait against the vulnerable British convoys making their way across the Atlantic.  These convoys were usually guarded by destroyers and corvettes, which would be no match for the heavy guns of the German ships.  The transports would be slaughtered.<br />Due to information received by Swedish spies, the British were alerted to the Germans' plans.  Two British Spitfires were sent to fly over a Norwegian fijord to discover if the Bismarck was at anchor.  Sure enough, the Spitfires spotted the German ships.  However, the Germans were still able to proceed into the Atlantic while the British were left trying to decide how to deal with them.<br />The British had two cruisers stationed near the Denmark Strait, and they eventually made radar contact with the German ships. The British managed to shadow the German ships and maintain radar contact while alerting other British forces to the location of the Bismarck.  Two British battleships, the Hood and Prince of Wales, set course for the Bismarck.  The Hood was the pride of the British fleet.  She had the same size guns as the Bismarck, but much thinner armor.  The British captain made several errors which, in the end, would turn out to be fatal.  Instead of allowing each ship to fight independently of one another, both were forced to move in conjunction together.  This allowed the Germans to &quot;cross the T&quot;, allowing full broadsides to bear on the British, while the British ships could only fire with their forward guns.  The Germans' fire support radar was also superior to the British, and soon the Bismarck had the range.  In under six minutes, the Bismarck destroyed the Hood and severely damaged the Prince of Wales.  Only three men survived from the Hood.<br />The chase continued for several more days and several thousand miles of ocean, with the Germans losing the British, and the British finally finding the Germans again.  Other units of the Royal Navy had been following the Bismarck, and finally were close enough to launch an air attack against her.  The only planes the British had available were obsolete Swordfish torpedo bombers, but they bravely took off from the aircraft carrier Ark Royal to attack the Bismarck.  The Bismarck put up an umbrella of anti-aircraft fire, but the Bismarck suffered a torpedo hit in her most vital area; her steering gear.  Now only able to manuver in a circle, the Bismarck became easy prey for the other pursuing warships.  The following day, the British battleships attacked, and soon the Bismarck was a flaming wreck.  Torpedoes finally put an end to her, and she disappeared under the waves of the Atlantic.<br />This book gives a very good account of the Bismarck chase.  From the description of the German commanders, Admiral Lutjens and Captain Lindemann as well as the British commanders Pound and Tovey, to the sinking itself, the reader is drawn in by the excitement of the hunt.  Lindemann and Lutjens never got along.  Lutjens was a strict by the book commander who very rarely shared any information with anyone, while Lindemann was well-liked by his crew and loved his ship and continually feuded with Lutjens, all the while saying he would not have his ship &quot;shot out from under him&quot;.  Indeed, it was Lutjens and his constant radio messages to the German command that enabled the British to find the Bismarck in the first place.<br />One aspect of the book that I found intriguing was the participation by the United States in the hunt for the Bismarck.  I was unaware that an American coast guard cutter could have directed British torpedo planes toward the Bismarck.<br />The chase and sinking are presented in great hour-by-hour detail throughout the book, as well as secret manuverings between Churchill and Roosevelt. Read this book and discover the story about one of the dramatic turning points of World War II.	2004-03-01

The first part of the book describes the feared &quot;Hell Ships&quot;.  These were massively overcrowded freighters that the Japanese used to transport POWs.  Most of the time, the POWs were packed in so tightly that they were unable to lay down.  Very little food or water was given to them, and their latrine amounted to a trough hanging over the side of the ship.  Aside from facing the constant beatings from the Japanese, these men also lived in fear of Allied submarine attack.  Indeed, many of the POWs died as a result of an Allied torpedo striking their Hell Ship.  The Japanese did very little to assist the prisoners in case the ship needed to be abandoned.  Most of the time, they were locked in their holds to drown as the ship sank.<br />Japanese submarines and commerce raiders also played a role in the high seas atrocities.  Many Japanese submarine captains would surface their sub after sinking an enemy vessel and machine gun the survivors in the water.<br />The chapters dealing with biological warfare and &quot;comfort women&quot; are particularly disturbing.  The Japanese would use Allied POWs as human &quot;guinea pigs&quot; for &quot;medical&quot; experiments.  As noted in the book, the Japanese would allow the POWs very little clothing and as they proceeded into colder cilmates, they would see how the POWs bodies would react.  Many of them died from exposure to the cold.  Others were thrown into the sea for &quot;survival tests&quot;, while others were subjected to various vaccine tests.<br />The &quot;comfort women&quot; were mostly young Korean women, about 12 to 20 years old, who were subjected to forced prostitution.  These women were lured in by false promises from the Japanese commander, placed aboard a ship, and sent to the front lines for the Japanese sailors and soldiers.  Many went mad, most contacted various diseases, and manydied.<br />The fact that amazes me is how to this day the Japanese can still deny so much of these atrocities.  Much of the history from this time period is not mentioned at all by the Japanese.  Hopefully one day they will realize their earlier wrongdoings and apologize for them.<br />I felt this was a good, albeit short, analysis of some of the atrocities committed by the Japanese.  I found the reading hard at some points due to all of the Japanese terms that the author chose to use, but overall, the book gives a good introduction to some of the crimes committed by the Japanese.	2004-02-19

According to the title, this book should be concerned with Rand, but in actuality, he is hardly mentioned in this book at all.  Instead, Robert Jordan has concentrated on the other members of the group from the Two Rivers, namely Mat, Perrin, Egwene, Nynaeve, and Elayne.<br />Mat has been taken to Tar Valon to be healed by the Aes Sedai after having the dagger from Shayol Ghul removed.  He is then given a letter from Elayne to deliver to Elayne's mother, Queen Morgase.  After delivering the letter, Mat learns that some of the Queen's guards intend to capture and kill Elayne, so he sets off to warn her.<br />Meanwhile, Elayne, Egwene, and Nynaeve have continued their training to become Aes Sedai, but they have learned a disturbing secret; some of the Aes Sedai are members of the Black Ajah; serveants of the Dark One.  The Amyrlin Seat has sent them off to track down the whereabouts of the Black Ajah. Their pursuits soon lead them to the city of Tear.<br />Perrin is in pursuit of Rand along with Moiraine, Lan, and Loial.  Bedeviled by dreams, Perrin is grappling with another deadly problem; how is he to escape the loss of his own humanity.  Rand is in search of the great sword called Callandor.  It is a crystal sword held in the Stone of Tear, in the chamber of the Heart of Stone.  No hand can touch it except the Dragon Reborn.  One of the signs of the Dragon's rebirth will be that the Dragon has taken Callandor.<br />Overall, I did like this book, but not as well as the first two books of the series.  The action throughout is good and kept me interested, but the title is somewhat misleading.  Rand is the supposed Dragon Reborn, but, as I stated earlier, he is hardly mentioned in this book at all.  I do recommend this book to fellow fantasy readers, but be aware of the misleading title and don't expect to read too much about Rand al'Thor in this volume.	2004-02-11

Located approximately 150 miles north of its more familiar neighbor Iwo Jima, Chichi Jima served as an early warning radar and radio station for the Japanese.  Nine American aviators were shot down over the island.  One, George Bush, would later become President of the United States.  The others disappeared.<br />In the course of this excellent book by the author of &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot;, the reader is taken back to the 1850s and the birth of the Japanese military and &quot;Bushido&quot; system.  At first, I was disappointed with the way the book was set up, and I felt that a lot of the information in the first few chapters was irrelevant to the subject being covered.  But as I read further, I discovered that this was the perfect introduction for the material covered later in the book.  The foundation that was laid in the beginning, such as the birth of the bushido code and the resentment that many Japanese felt toward the Americans after the visit of Commodore Perry helped to describe the transformation of the Japanese soldier from a normal human being into an unhuman killing machine.<br />Although the book describes the story of the airmen shot down over Chichi Jima in great detail, Bradley also talks about the entire Pacific war and the role that air power played.  From the attack on Pearl Harbor to the surrender of Japan, Bradley describes the heroic Flyboys and their contributions to victory.  <br />The atrocities comitted by the Japanese against the American aviators are described in chilling detail.  The Japanese regarded anyone who surrendered as sub-human, because surrender was unfamiliar to them.  Japanese soldiers were taught never to surrender.  Instead, they should kill themselves before surrendering.  Aviators were treated even more harshly than other POWs, because the Japanese held them directly responsible for the effects of bombings and so forth.  But the events on Chichi Jima were so grotesque that its hard to imagine that anyone was capable of them.  The Japanese would have a burial detail dig a hole, then the POW was blindfolded and forced to kneel while a Japanese soldier would behead him with a samurai sword.  But the part that was so inhumane was the dissection and eating of the flesh by the Japanese.  The boys shot down over Chichi Jima became food for the Japanese.<br />Many people wonder why the Americans dropped the atom bombs on Japan, and many called the acts &quot;inhuman&quot;.  If the atomic bombings were inhuman, then what would one call the slicing and eating of another human's flesh?<br />I highly recommend this fine book.  The narrative is impecable, and the story is almost too bizarre to comprehend, but Bradley writes about this little-known aspect of the war with a true flair and amazing storytelling ability.  A masterful work of history, this book will change our understanding of the Pacific war	2004-01-12

Everyone is in the town of Fal Dara.  The Amyrlin Seat; leader of the Aes Sedai, has arrived to meet with Rand, Mat, and Perrin, but before the meeting can take place, a raid by Trollocs and other followers of The Dark One results in Padan Fain, an imprisoned follower of the Dark One, being freed from prison.  This raid resulted in Fain acquiring Mat's cursed dagger along with the Horn of Valere, which, if blown, will awaken the dead spirits to fight, regardless if the person who blows the horn is good or evil.<br />After Fain's capture of the Horn and dagger, Loail, Rand, Mat, and Perrin set out with Ingtar and his soldiers to recover them.  Mat must recover the dagger and deliver it to the Aes Sedai for healing or he will die. <br />Meanwhile, Egwene and Nynaeve begin their journey to the White Tower in Tar Valon to begin their training as Aes Sedai.  Once there, they meet two new friends, Min and Elayne, and also a future enemy, Liandrin, who ends up betraying them.<br />Many new characters are introduced in this book, and long-lost and feared dead gleeman Thom reappears as well.  The story flows along very well and the action is fast paced and exciting.  The momentum picks up greatly from the first book.  I've enjoyed this series so far, and I'm looking forward to the next installment.  Fantasy fans will definitely enjoy this action-packed series.  One aspect of Jordan's books that I've found helpful is the glossary that he includes in the back of his books.  It makes it much easier to keep track of terms and places by referring to it when necessary.	2003-12-17

The story centers around Estel Myers, a young man who joins the Army as a corpsman.  After serving a tour in China, Myers was assigned to the Philippines shortly before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. The Japanese invaded in mid-December, 1941, and Myers was taken prisoner by the Japanese.<br />Myers suffered for two years in a Japanese prison camp with very little food or water, but his ultimate punishment was soon to follow.  The Americans had turned the tide against the Japanese,and were fighting their way back to re-capture the Philippines.  Realizing this, the Japanese began loading their POWs on &quot;Hell Ships&quot;; grossly overloaded freighters; for the long voyage to prison camps in Japan.  Myers was loaded aboard the ship Oryuku Maru with approximately 1,600 other POWs.  Only about 400 arrived in Japan alive.  Myers survived the sinking of the Oryuku Maru as well as transfers from two other Hell Ships before reaching Japan.  <br />The conditions on the ships were much worse than in the camps.  Each man was allotted approximately 1/4 cup of rotten rice per day, along with a tiny amount of water.  Men were unable to sit or lay down in the holds of the ships due to the massive overcrowding.  Sanitary facilities amounted to a bucket lowered by the Japanese.  The death rate was astounding.  In the later stages of the voyage, as many as fifty men were dying per day.<br />Upon reaching Japan, many of the men were put to work on docks, in coal mines, or building defense shelters.  Many died, but some, including Myers, managed to survive to be liberated by the Americans.  Myers eventually succumbed years later due to the toll taken on his body by the Japanese.<br />This is an eye-opening book.  The atrocities committed by the Japanese are unbelievable, and it is a miracle that Myers managed to survive for so long.  Read this fine book and live the life of a POW.	2003-11-14

At over 750 feet long, it was nearly as large as a World War II era battleship.  The thing that made the &quot;Fitz&quot; so special was her large cargo capacity; she could carry well over twenty thousand tons of cargo in her massive holds.  However, these holds might have ultimately led to her demise on a stormy night in November, 1975.<br />The Great lakes are famous for their storms and gales, but in early November, 1975, a storm of immense strength bore down on Lake Superior and unleased its vengance on the ships that dared sail on the lake.  The storm was born in the southwestern United States, and as it moved slowly northward, it gathered tremendous amounts of moisture.  Its warm winds, when coupled with the north's cooler air, made a cauldron of swirling winds, sleet, and snow.  The winds whipped as much as one hundred miles per hour and made waves as high as thirty feet.<br />While this storm was intensifying, the &quot;Fitz&quot; set out on its trip across Superior.  Another ship, the Arthur Anderson, was travelling in the same direction as the Fitzgerald and they kept in contact by radio.  Soon, the rolling seas were slamming into the Fitz, and she began to take on water.  Some water managed to leak in around the hatch covers, but, without radar to assist them, the Fitz was forced to rely upon charts from the U.S. and Canada to map a course across Superior.  Unfortunately, the charts weren't completely accurate, and the Fitz's course sent her directly over a submurged shoal, which punched holes in the hull, allowing more water to enter the ship.<br />The ship began to list and the pumps were unable to keep up with the amount of water pouring in.  Finally, a huge wave hit the side of the ship, driving the bow deep into the lake, and instead of popping back up, the bow kept on going down, taking the rest of the ship along.  Twenty nine men died in the span of a few minutes as the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald came to rest in 530 feet of water at the bottom of Lake Superior.<br />This book gives an excellent narrative about the loss of the Fitzgerald and life on the Great Lakes in general.  The reader also gets a glimpse into the lives of each crewman aboard, as well as some other memorable shipwrecks that occurred earlier on the Great Lakes.  I recommend this book very highly.  Maritime readers and adventure fans alike will surely enjoy it.	2003-10-28

Louis was a typical young child; full of mischief and adventure, and he always seemed to be getting into trouble for one thing or another, but thanks to his older brother Pete's love and encouragement, Louis' life began to change for the better.<br />Pete was an outstanding track and field athlete and he encouraged Louis to do the same.  Soon, Louis was a world-class middle distance runner and held the national collegiate record for the mile run.  He qualified for the 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin and placed eighth in his race.  Even though he didn't win a medal, he still accomplished what the large majority of people never will.<br />A few years later, Louis joined the army as a navigator on a B-24 Liberator heavy bomber.  Based in Hawaii, his crew participated in the bombing of Japanese-held territory as well as search and rescue missions.  It was on one of these rescue missions that Louis' own plane became disabled and forced to crash.  What happened next can only be described as a miracle, as Louis and another crewmember survived for forty seven days on a rubber raft, while eating small fish and even seabirds while collecting rainwater to drink.<br />After drifting for two thousand miles, Louis was finally picked up by the Japanese, where he was imprisoned on the Japanese-held island of Kwajalein.  During his time in prison on Kwajalein and later in Japan itself, Louis was subjected to numerous beatings and very little food.  One particular guard called &quot;The Bird&quot; was especially cruel. <br />The war finally ended in September, 1945, and slowly, Louis managed to return to civillian life.  However, he had accumulated a great amount of hatred, and he suppressed his feeling with alcohol and carousing.  Finally, Louis met a woman named Cynthia and fell in love.  However, their relationship was anything but easy.  Louis' drinking and harsh worlds nearly drove Cynthia and their newborn daughter away, but she decided to stay.<br />Cynthia met a neighbor who was a Christian and started attending meetings, but Louis was reluctant to go.  After some nudging from his wife, Louis finally attended and a transformation began; Louis began to have feelings he never had before; feelings of forgiveness.  Louis accepted Christ into his life and began working as a Christian missionary.  He even travelled to Japan, met his former captors face to face, and forgave them for what they did to him.<br />This is a truly uplifting and inspiring book.  Louis' life has been truly remarkable in every sense of the word.  I was drawn in to his story and found myself cheering for him when he became a Christian.  Read this great book and experience the growth of an unruly young man into a messenger for God.	2003-10-21

It is now twenty years after the survivors of the battle with the Morgawr have returned, and Grianne Ohmsford, the former Ilse Witch, is now the Ard Rhys, or High Druid.  However, not everyone at the Druid's keep at Paranor is supportive of her.   Shadea a'Ru, a rival druid, has devised a scheme to remove Grianne from Paranor and place her in another dimension.  Using a potion called liquid night, Shadea manages to sneak into the Ard Rhys' chambers and administer it to her.  When Grianne awakens, she is no longer at Paranor, but trapped inside the Forbidding.<br />Tagwen, Grianne's faithful dwarf assistant, realizes she is missing and immediately suspects Shadea and her accomplices.  Immediately, he decides to find Grianne's brother Bek Ohmsford, because his use of the wishsong may help in finding Grianne.  Unfortunately upon arriving, Tagwen discovers that Bek has gone away on an expedition and Pen, Beck's son, is the only one home.<br />However, the druids have also thought of it to search for Bek and arrive almost at the same time as Tagwen.  Pen and Tagwen flee and begin a journey to Emberen in search of Ahren Elessedil, the Elven Druid who survived the battle against the Morgawr twenty years earlier.  With information given to them by the King of the Silver River, the companions begin their journey to find the Tanequil, a tree which has branches that will enable Pen to cross over into the Forbidding and bring Grianne back to the Four Lands.  Will the companions make it to the Tanequil?  Will Grianne survive inside the Forbidding?<br />Brooks has written another fine book which is surely to become a fantasy classic. As with each of Brooks' preceeding books, this one immediately draws the reader in with characters that the reader genuinely cares about and a plot that will definitely keep the pages turning.  I'm only sorry that I'll have to wait until next year for book two to be released.  I highly recommend this book.  Its a great beginning to a new and exciting Brooks series.	2003-10-14

Rand al'Thor is the hero of the series and he begins his journey from his home in the Two Rivers in this volume.  He is sent on an epic journey to unite the people of his world against the evil forces of the Dark One, who has sought out Rand and his friends Mat and Perrin for his own use.  Rand's quest leads him far away from home and to places he's only heard about.  Will Rand succeed in his quest or will his world be destroyed?<br />This is the second epic fantasy series I've become involved with, the other being Terry Brooks' Shannara series, and Jordan compares favorably to Brooks in terms of character development and storytelling.  I was hooked as soon as I started reading this book, and it got better as I went further along.  Although the pace slows somewhat toward the middle, it still held my attention throughout the entire book.  After reading this book, I'll now read the others in the Wheel of Time series.  I'm sure fantasy fiction fans like me will enjoy this book.  I'm eagerly anticipating reading more about Rand and his companions in upcoming volumes.	2003-10-02

Authors such as Stephen Ambrose, John Keegan, and Dan Kurzman have contributed to this fine book.  The layout of the book is excellent.  Instead of having individual chapters, the editors have put the essays into chronological order, so the reader doesn't necessarily have to read the book in sequential order.  Rather, the reader has the freedom to skip to the parts of the book that they find the most interesting if they so choose.<br />Each essay gives a unique insight into a specific area of the war.  Some of my favorites included \\"Diary of a Tail Gunner\\", told by a B-17 tail gunner who survived twenty six missons over Nazi territory.  I also enjoyed \\"The Other Pearl Harbor\\", which discussed MacArthur's failures in the Phillipines after the Pearl Harbor attack.  There is something for everyone in this book, regardless if you enjoy reading about the European or Pacific theaters.<br />This is a good book and gives a fine overview of the entire war as well as some lesser-known encounters.	2003-09-08

Brooks, the author of twenty New York Times best-sellers, provides readers with valuable tips for coming up with ideas for their book (described in his chapter about daydreaming), outlining, character development, publishing, and many other tips designed to help the new author.<br />I also enjoyed Brooks' description of his own struggles to get his first book, the legendary Sword of Shanara published.  Brooks was born and raised in Sterling, IL, which is a town located only ten miles from where I live.  One person, Lester Del Rey, believed in Brooks' work and offered to publish it.  The rest, as they say, is history.  Thanks to Lester's faith, Terry has become one of the top-selling fantasy fiction authors.  <br />The personal insights into Terry''s life provide the reader with a picture of how Terry has become the author he has today.  The chapters dealing with Terry's grandson reveal how a child's imagination can be used as a basis for writing.  Also, Terry's poor experience with the adaptation of the movie Hook and the subsequent success with the adaptation of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace show that by learning from past mistakes and applying the lessons learned, success can be achieved in a later similar project.<br />I've read all of Terry Brooks' books and will continue to do so with great enthusiasm.  I highly recommend this fine book.  Aspiring authors will surely benefit from Terry's teachings, while fantasy fiction fans will enjoy getting a glimpse into what makes Terry's ideas come to life.	2003-08-26

This final volume of Samuel Eliot Morison's fine series covers the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa along with the formal Japanese surrender on September 2, 1945.<br />The main purpose for securing the island of Iwo Jima was to provide a rescue station for crippled B-29 bombers returning from Japan as well as an advanced fighter escort base for P-51 Mustang escort fighters.  The invasion took place in February 1945, and it was originally thought that securing the island would only take about four days.  How wrong we were.  This battle lasted four weeks and cost many thousands of American casualties.  The enduring act of the war for the Americans occurred during this battle when the flag was raised on Mt. Suribachi and was forever captured on film.  I was disappointed with this section of the book.  Only 70 pages of the book deal with the Iwo Jima campaign, so I felt that many important aspects of the battle were left out completely.<br />In April, 1945, the Americans turned their attention to Okinawa.  Located only 350 miles from the Japanese mainland, Okinawa was to serve as a prime staging area for the invasion of Japan, which was scheduled for November 1945.  This battle covers the great majority of this book.  Every aspect of the battle is covered, from the landings to the kamikaze attacks against the American ships.  Perhaps the best part of the book deals with the description of the kamikaze attacks against the radar picket destroyers which were stationed around Okinawa.  These ships faced the wrath of the kamikaze forces and many were sunk, but these heroic sailors and ships put up a tremendous fight against the Japanese and provided an invaluable service by vectoring out C.A.P. aircraft as well as warning the fleet to incoming kamikaze attacks.  They were the true heroes of Okinawa.<br/>Other important events, such as the suicide mission of the Japanese superbattleship Yamato and the tragic and unnecessary sinking of the USS Indianapolis are also described in this volume.  As with other books in this set, this one contains excellent photographs and maps to assist the reader.  <br />With the surrender of Japan in September 1945, one war ended and another war dawned; the cold war, which lasted for forty three years.	2003-08-13

The Juneau was taking part in the great Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on the night of November 13, 1942.  Designed to provide anti-aircraft protection, the Juneau was not very well equipped for ship to ship fighting.  During the course of the battle, the Juneau suffered many hits from Japanese ships which resulted in a broken keel, but she was still able to manuver under her own power.  However, a lurking Japanese submarine snuck in and torpedoed the hapless ship.<br /> 700 men, including the five Sullivan brothers, managed to abandon ship, but, to their surprise and ultimate dismay, the task force kept on going without stopping for survivors. The task force commander felt that it was too risky for the other ships to remain in the sub-infested waters, so the survivors were left to fend for themselves for eight days against the sun and shark attacks.  In the end, only about 100 of the 700 who went in the water survived.  Among the casulties were all five Sullivans.<br />I highly recommend this book.  The author does an excellent job of describing how the Sullivans enlisted together and insisted on serving on the same ship.  The Naval Battle of Guadalcanal is described in a vivid narrative that places the reader at the center of the action.  I've also read several books about the sinking of the Indianapolis, and the parallels between the Juneau and Indianapolis are uncanny; both sunk under very similar circumstances, and the survivors of each ship suffered under almost identical conditions. Finally, the U.S. Navy named a destroyer after the Sullivan brothers.<br />Read this book and learn about the heroic Sullivans and how they made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.  I would also recommend the book &quot;Fatal Voyage&quot; by the same author, and the movie &quot;The Fighting Sullivans&quot; for more information on this topic.	2003-07-30

From the opening landings in August, 1942 to the final Japanese withdrawl in February, 1943, every skirmish, banzai charge, and naval engagement is covered in this excellent volume.  Frank's writing style is engrossing and easy to follow so the reader will not get bogged down along the way.  This is a large book at over 700 pages, but it reads like a novel.  I was immediately drawn in from the beginning, and Frank held my attention throughout the book.<br />Every aspect of the battle is touched upon at some point in the book.  From the capture of Henderson Field to the great Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, the reader is taken on a journey of survival against an enemy which fought with barbaric ferocity.  The Japanese came to call Guadalcanal &quot;The Island of Death&quot; due to their huge losses in both men (from starvation and battle) and equipment.<br />Rarely does a book come along that so thoroughly covers a topic as this one.  I highly recommend this excellent work.  If you've never read anything about the battle of Guadalcanal, you'll be an expert after reading this book.  I also recommend Frank's other fine book entitled &quot;Downfall&quot;, which deals with the invasion of Japan and the atomic bombs.	2003-07-29

O'Donnell has taken oral testimonies from surviving veterans of the war in Europe and put them together in this excellent book.  Beginning in August, 1942 with the Dieppe raid to the fall of Germany in 1945, these men give heart-felt accounts of what it was like to be on the front lines of combat.<br />Each veteran has his own unique story to tell.  Some men sweated out long nights under artillery fire, while others patrolled deep into German-held territory.  O'Donnell also does a wonderful job of describing the bond that formed between these men.  Each man was willing to give his own life so the others in his platoon might survive.  It was this uncommon valor among the men that helped them survive and, ultimately, win the war.<br />The book also contains excellent commentary by the author.  He sets the scene for each chapter with a compelling narrative about the battle or campaign that is covered, then he lets the men who actually fought there bring the battle to life.  My favorite section of the book dealt with the siege of Bastogne and the battle for the Hurtgen Forest.  The images created by O'Donnell are very vivid and will surely remain in my mind.<br />I usually read about the Pacifc theater, but this book has opened my eyes to the European conflict as well.  I give this book my highest recommendation.  Oral histories are the best way to learn about history, and this book keeps up that tradition.  I also recommend O'Donnell's excellent work about the Pacific theater entitled &quot;Into the Rising Sun&quot;.	2003-07-24

Layton served as Fleet Intelligence Officer for Admirals Kimmel and Nimitz.  He, along with the other members of station Hypo, were assigned the task of breaking into Japan's secret codes, especially their JN-25 cypher.  Through exhausting efforts by its members, they were finaly able to penetrate enough of the JN-25 code to make reasonable assumptions as to what the Japanese navy was planning.  &quot;Magic&quot; was the term used for the intercept and decryption of these secret codes.<br />However, no decoding was actually done at Pearl Harbor, because there was no &quot;Purple&quot; decoding machine there.  All intercepts had to be sent to Washinton for decryption, and Hawaii relied on Washington for their information.  Layton's thesis is that Pearl Harbor was denied vital intelligence which, if issued in a timely fashion, could have alerted Pearl Harbor to the impending attack which occurred on December 7, 1941.  Although I agree with some of his thesis, I also believe that the Pearl Harbor commanders made terrible mistakes of their own which also contributed to the unpreparedness of Pearl Harbor.<br />One message that Washington failed to send Pearl Harbor which I believe, along with Layton, could have alerted the fleet to the attack was the so-called &quot;bomb plot&quot; message.  In a nutshell, this message divided Pearl Harbor into several sections and placed ships in each section; almost like laying an invisible grid over the harbor.  Of all the messages that Pearl Harbor failed to receive, this was probably the most important.<br />However, with this stated, I also believe that the commanders made grievous errors of their own.  On November 27, 1941, a &quot;war warning&quot; message was sent to both commanders at Pearl Harbor.  Both seemed perplexed and unsure of the course of action to be taken.  Why was this?  Both Admiral Kimmel and General Short were high ranking members of the military, yet they both dragged their feet when they received this message.  Short simply ordered defense against sabotage instead of ordering an all-out alert, while Kimmel failed to order any further long-range patrols, plus he didn't order the battle force to sea. They seemed incapable of making any independent judgement of their own.  Instead, they needed to be told directly what to do.  These omissions are unforgivable.<br />Inter-service rivalry also played a role in the failure.  As pointed out by Layton, there was very little inter-service cooperation or sharing of messages, so most of the time, one usually didn't know what the other was doing.  Further, during the Midway operation, a rivalry betwen station Hypo and the Washington-based intelligence unit nearly cost us the battle, but fortunately, Layton and commander Joe Rochefort were able to convince Nimitz that Hypo, not Washington, was correct.<br />I thought this was a good book, but I disagree with Layton's assertion that Kimmel and Short were scapegoats and had no clue what was happening.  Granted, there was some intelligence that was definitely denied to them, but they should have been able to interpret events on ther own, namely the war warning message.  This book is a good counter-argument to other works, such as &quot;At Dawn We Slept&quot;.  The information about the battle of Midway is especially interesting, plus the story of the codebreaking activities was well-done.this message.

Iwo was sought by the Americans as an emergency airfield for the B-29 Superfortresses which were damaged over Japan, as well as an advanced fighter base for fighter escorts.  <br />This book describes in vivid detail the American invasion and struggle to secure the island.  Much to the chagrin of the Marines, they found out that the island was covered with ash which made it next to impossible to walk or move heavy equipment.  As the Marines made their way inland, the Japanese, who constructed underground bunkers and pillboxes which were virtually untouched by the shore bombardment, began to attack en masse.  The Marines suffered more casualties in this battle than at any other time in the war.  Also, over twenty medals of honor were awarded (some postumously).  Ross describes each medal of honor recipient and what they did to earn the medal. Some threw themselves on live grenades to save their comrades, while others rushed enemy pillboxes in the face of murderous fire.  This was the most fascinating part of the book for me.<br />Ross has produced an excellent book about Iwo Jima that will undoubtedly remain a classic.  His writing style flows very easily and the reader never gets bogged down.  I highly recommend this work along with &quot;Flags of our Fathers&quot;.  Both do a commendable job of describing the ferocious fighting that took place on this tiny island.	2003-07-08

A powerful Japanese fleet sailed into the bright blue waters of the Coral Sea.  However, unknown to the Japanese, the Americans, through the efforts of their code-breakers, knew the number and types of ships in the Japanese force and they sent their own force to halt the Japanese advance.  <br />This was the first naval battle fought where the opposing sides never saw one another.  The Americans, under the command of Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher, stuck first at the Japanese, sinking a light aircraft carrier.  An ironic note occurred here as the two air strike forces actually passed each other, but neither side sighted the other.  The Japanese had greater success, sinking the carrier Lexington and damaging the Yorktown.  In the end, this turned out to be a tactical victory for the Japanese due to the greater American shipping losses, but it was a strategic victory for the Americans because the Japanese forces were forced to withdraw, never threatening Port Moresby or Australia again.<br />I enjoyed this book very much.  The description of the battle is very good, and the author pays great attention to detail.  Perhaps my favorite part of the book involves the struggle of the oiler Neosho and the destroyer Sims, both attacked by the Japanese because they were mistaken for aircraft carriers.  The author devotes several chapters to the heroic struggle of these tiny ships and their survivors.<br />This battle changed the outcome of the war for both the Japanese and Americans.  After this battle, the Japanese never regained the offensive in the Pacific, while the Americans began the long road to Tokyo.	2003-07-08

There was a secret third ship, the Shinano, that was to be included in this class.  However, with the rise of the aircraft carrier, it was decided to convert the Shinano from a battleship to a carrier. Measuring almost 900 feet in length, Shinano was the largest aircraft carrier in the world, and she held that distinction until the United States launched the USS Enterprise in the 1960s.  Cloaked in secrecy, the conversion took place.  Crewmembers were threatened with imprisonment or execution if they muttered even the slightest words about the existance of Shinano.  Due to the extreme secrecy of her construction, many essential tests, which would later prove to be fatal, were not conducted on Shinano.  For example, the watertight integrity of the bulkheads and seals were never tested properly.<br />An ocean away, Captain Joseph F. Enright and his submarine Archer-fish, were leaving for the boat's fifth war patrol.  Captain Enright had been haunted by the memory of failing to sink an enemy carrier earlier in the war while serving as commander of the submarine Dace.  Feeling inadequate as a commander, he asked to be relieved of command.  After serving at the American submarine base on Midway island as a relief crewman, he finally got his chance to command his own boat again, and he was determined to make sure that he didn't repeat his earlier mistakes this time around.  Taking up his patrol station along the main Japanese island of Honshu, Archer-fish awaited action.  This particular area of ocean had become known as the \\"hit parade\\", due to the large number of sinkings by American submarines.  On Tuesday, November 28, 1944, Archer-fish sighted a large enemy vessel with four escorts.  This proved to be Shinano.  Unable to run at maximum speed due to only eight of her twelve boilers being lit, and also suffering from a problem with her propellers, Shinano was limited to a speed of approximately eighteen knots.  What ensued over the next several hours could only be described as a classic game of cat and mouse.  Enright and Archer-fish desperately tried to keep up with the Shinano while trying to anticipate any course changes she might make.  Finally, at 0300 hours on Wednesday, November 29, 1944, the Archer-fish was ready to fire.<br />A spread of six torpedoes leapt from her torpedo tubes, each being fired at eight second intervals.  Four explosions rocked the Japanese carrier while Archer-fish dove for the safety of the depths.  The ship was mortally wounded.  Her protective bladder had failed to stop the torpedoes, and, in the words of Enright, they cut through the bladder \\"like a sword through butter\\".  Later that morning, the Shinano, with her bow raised high out of the water, slipped below the surface of the Pacific Ocean.  Her maiden voyage had lasted all of seventeen hours.<br />This is a very exciting book.  The format is excellent, with the chapters alternating between the action on the Archer-fish to the action on the Shinano. The first-hand account of the action by Captain Enright leaps off the pages and places the reader directly at the conning tower during the attack.

This volume describes the action which took place in and around the Marianas Islands in the summer of 1944.  The islands of Saipan, Tinian, and Guam were successfully captured and turned into air bases for the big B-29 Superfortresses so they could reach the Japanese homeland.  These battles were fought with great savagery on both sides.  For example, rather then surrender to the American forces, many Japanese soldiers and civilians threw themselves from cliffs overlooking the Pacific on Saipan.<br />The Battle of the Philippine Sea is where the Japanese navy ultimately, for all intents and purposes, ceased to be an effective fighting force.  However, at the beginning, it was the Japanese who sighted the Americans first.  They launched four successive attacks against Admiral Spruance's carriers while Spruance was still searching for the Japanese ships.  Thanks to murderous anti-aircraft fire and superior combat air patrol, the Japanese would end up losing over four hundred aircraft in what has become known as the \\"Great Marianas Turkey Shoot\\".  Three Japanese aircraft carriers were also sunk by American submarines and planes.  However, this victory was greatly scrutinized.  Spruance was criticized for not finding the enemy ships sooner, and for conducting poor air searches.  Many believed that the victory could have been even greater than it was had the Japanese been spotted sooner, or had the Americans done a better job of pursuing the fleeing Japanese.<br />This is a very good book, and the battle is explained expertly with the help of numerous maps and photographs.  I highly recommend this book, as well as others in this series.  They give the reader a first-hand account of the war at sea.	2003-06-19

Author Jere Longman has taken biographical sketches and family rememberances of each passenger along with specific details about the flight itself and   created a testimony to the passengers that will endure for a long time.<br />Each passenger has their own biographical sketch; from Todd Beamer's devout Christian background and his unforgettable \\"Let's Roll\\", which became a rallying cry much like \\"Remember Pearl Harbor\\" from a generation ago, to Jeremy Glick's undying love for his new baby girl, the true heroes of 9-11 are brought to life on the pages of this book.  Using comments and testimonials from family members and intertwining actual events which occurred on the plane after the takeover, the reader gets a clear picture of what happened aboard United flight 93 on that fateful September day.<br />By now, everyone knows the story of how the passengers and crew fought back and ultimately saved hundreds if not thousands of lives by forcing the terrorists to crash the plane, but let us never forget these heroic people who, in the face of certain death, made the ultimate sacrifice so that others might live.<br />This is the first book I've read on the September 11 tragedy, and I recommend it.  The biographies of the passengers are the main part of the book, and I felt like I got to know each person on an individual basis.  The only part of the book that I found to be what I considered lacking was the actual events aboard the plane.  I wish more attention could have been paid in this area.  Overall, however, this is a good book and does a good job of explaining what the members of flight 93 faced and how they banded together as one so that others would not meet the same fate.	2003-06-16

Having finally escaped from his abusive mother, Dave spent several years as a foster child, all the while being shuffled between different foster homes.  Upon reaching the age of eighteen, he decided to join the Air Force with the hopes of becoming a fireman.  As per his nature, Dave worked hard, but his dream ended up in disappointment.  Due to a mix up in paperwork, Dave was given the job as a cook.  Undaunted, Dave dove into his new assignment with his typical gusto; always wanting to do the best he could.  While toiling away as a cook, he began to develop interest in becoming an aircraft crewman specializing in mid-air refueling.  He again applied himself as hard as he could only to have his dream shattered again.  But his determination and drive to succeed drove him to keep sight of his goal.  Finally, he received his long-awaited commission as an in-flight refueler; a post he held for thirteen years.<br />Dave also met and fell in love with a woman named Patsy, but their marriage was rocky at best.  Dave was never able to completely allow himself to break free from his past, and this affected his life with Patsy immensely.  Fights always broke out, and Dave seemed to always be the one apologizing, while Patsy continued her freeloading ways.  They did have a son, Stephen, who is the light of Dave's life.  After ultimately divorcing from Patsy, Dave met and fell in love with Marsha and settled along the Russian River.<br />As with the other books in this series, Dave takes the reader on a journey through the highs and lows of his life.  Dave is confronted with the fact that his alcoholic father, who never so much as raised a hand while his mother was abusing him, is dying of cancer.  Ultimately, Dave finds it in his heart to forgive his father, but he never forgave his mother for the hell she put him through.  <br />This series is a must-read.  Froma terrified child to a successful best-selling author, Dave Pelzer has seen and endured more in his lifetime than most people ever will, and he's survived by his life-long motto of trusting in God and working as hard as you can.  The result is a successful author and motivational speaker.  Dave's inspiration should serve as a shining example of trusting in one's abilities to overcome even the most extreme of circumstances.  Congratulations, Dave!	2003-06-11

On April 9, 1942, the penninsula of Bataan fell into Japanese hands.  The surrendering Americans were then subjected to a ninety mile march without adequate food or water.  Men were shot and bayonetted for sport by the Japanese.  Once the Americans reached their prison camp, they were herded into a tiny area with only two water spigots.  Hundreds of men died each day from dysentery, malaria, and starvation.  Many healthy men were soon reduced to skeletons.  Others simply refused to go on any further.  Still others found that the only way they could survive was to find a friend to help them get through.<br />After two to three years of living in this nightmare, the American forces returned to liberate the Philippines. Fearing that the prisoners would be liberated by the returning Americans,  the Japanese loaded the surviving POWs into \\"Hell Ships\\"; massively overcrowded freighters to be transferred to the Japanese home islands. Some of the men went mad, while others drowned when their ships were sunk by American submarines. Once in Japan,  the men were forced to work long hours in Japanese factories and mines while still receiving little in the way of food or medical care. The conditions in the Japanese labor camps were as unimaginable as they were in the Philippines; little food and water and constant beatings by the Japanese guards.<br />I've read several oral history books about World War II, and this book is one of the best.  Knox lets the survivors' stories create this book.  I was in awe of the horrible conditions that these men were forced to survive under.  It is a true testament to the human spirit that these men were able to overcome the merciless beatings and the extermely meager food and water rations they received to survive and return home.  Anyone who questions why the Americans used the atomic bomb should read about the Bataan prisoners and what they were forced to endure.  I highly recommend this fine piece of oral history.  Read it and understand what some of the true heroes of World War II did for their country.	2003-06-05

This book picks up where \\"A Child Called It\\" left off.  David, emotionally and physically scarred from the abuse suffered at the hands of his alcoholic mother, has finally escaped her grasp and has been put into foster care.  Although he has finally escaped from his mother, David soon realizes that he still has much to learn.  In the space of a few years David was shuffled between several different foster homes, each with a different set of circumstances.  Along the way, David finally learns what its like to have simple hugs and kisses, words of encouragement, and real food to eat.  All of these things were denied to him by his mother.<br />David also faces the stigma of being labeled an \\"F-Child\\"; a foster child.  Most \\"F-Children\\" were automatically considered outcasts by others, regardless of circumstances. He suffered the ridicule of others and wondered if he was worthy of being loved or if he will ever be a part of a REAL family.  The instability of being in and out of five different foster homes also left a mark on David.  Just as it seemed he was becoming accustomed to his \\"home\\", something would happen and he would be moved to another foster home.  Through all this, David always maintained his faith and remarkable inner strengh.  He knew in his own heart that he was special, and that mattered more than anything else.<br />This book and \\"A Child Called It\\" have left an indelible impression on me.  I can't imagine the pain and suffering that David was forced to endure, yet due to unbelievable inner strength and through the power of prayer and self-perserverance, David Pelzer managed to overcome what may seem to some as insurmountable.  David's resiliance and courage are shining testimonies to the power of believing in oneself and never giving up no matter what.  Needless to say, I give this book and \\"A Child Called It\\" my highest recommendation.  I'm sure you'll probably cry along the way, just as I did, but this young boy's strength and courage should serve as shining examples to all of us who think we have it bad.  We don't know what bad is until we have experienced just one minute of David Pelzer's life. Bravo, David!!	2003-05-14

This book is different from others on the subject because it deals strictly with the attack itself instead of covering the events leading up to the attack. It wasn't written to be an all-encompassing book about diplomatic manuvering and behind-the-scenes negotiations.  Lord's purpose was to describe the attack itself, and he accomplishes his thesis very well.  Lord starts his story in the early morning hours of December 7 describing the last night of peace in Hawaii.  Many of the servicemen had been attending parties and dances like any other Saturday night.  There was no inkling of the impending attack.<br />Lord does an excellent job of describing the events from both an American and Japanese perspective.  Extreme attention is paid to the preparation of the Japanese pilots and crews.  He also describes the conditions in Honolulu and aboard the ships anchored in Pearl Harbor.  Many of the sailors were returning to their ships from a night out,while others were planning to spend a lazy Sunday ashore.  Civillian accounts of the attack are also included in the narrative.<br />In the span of approximately two hours, the Japanese severely crippled the U.S Pacific Fleet.  Over 2000 service personnel were killed and many hundreds more injured.  Scores of airplanes were destroyed, and many ships sunk or damaged.  (However, the only ships that were complete losses were the Arizona, Oklahoma, and Utah.  All others were repaired and returned to service later in the war). Japanese losses were light; twenty nine aircraft shot down and five midget submarines sunk.<br />This book does an excellent job of describing the attack itself.  I've read dozens of books about Pearl Harbor, and I would rate this as one of the best.  However, I caution the reader that this book deals strictly with the attack itself.  For information about the diplomatic aspect of the attack, I would recommend Gordon Prange's \\"At Dawn We Slept\\".	2003-05-08

The book, written by David himself, chronicles his life as a terrified young child growing up with an abusive, alcoholic mother and a spineless father who simply turned away when the abuse started.  Over the course of several years, young David was forced to endure abuse that is almost impossible to comprehend.  He never received regular meals, he was forced to sleep in the garage which would got very cold at night, his drunken mother tried to force him to lie down on a lit stove, he was stabbed in the abdomen, yet his mother refused to take him to the hospital for medical care.  He was simply sent back to his worn-out army cot in the basement.<br />Soon, David turned to stealing food from other children at school.  This worked for a while, but word soon got back to his mother, who beat him severely for his stealing. <br />The abuse suffered by David was not just physical; it was emotional and verbal as well.  David's mother soon quit referring to him by his name.  He soon became \\"the boy\\", and finally \\"it\\".  He was never allowed any interaction with the rest of his family.  He simply remained in his own little world while the rest of the family ate their meals and did other family things.  David was then forced to clean up after the family's meals within a specified time or he would receive another beating from mother.  If he made it, sometimes he was \\"rewarded\\" with a few left-over scraps from the dirty plates.  This type of abuse continued for years. The only thing that kept David going was his desire for someone to love him, take care of him, and call him their son.<br />I cried several times while reading this book.  I immediately thought of my own son while reading and how much I love him.  It is incomprehensible to me how anyone could possibly harm a young, defenseless child.<br />This book rates as one of the best I've ever read.  As a father of two young children with another on the way, I simply cannot comprehend how someone could abuse their own children so severely.  Granted, David's mother and father both had severe drinking problems, but that is no excuse for abuse.  Also, why was David singled out?  None of the other children were ever abused.  David deserves tremendous credit for surviving for so long.  Without his strong courage and desire to live, he probably would have ended up dead.  All children are a blessing.  Parents should be thankful for their children and love them unconditionally. They are gifts from God.	2003-05-06

It is MUCH better than the last one.  In this volume, the members of the Tribulation Force are scattered all over the globe; some in the Middle East, some in the underground compound in San Diego. However, all too soon, the members are about to find out that their safe house is no longer safe.  Chloe Williams decides to go outside of the compound in San Diego to have a look around after she spotted a GC vehicle while looking through the periscope which is used for outside surveillance.  Unfortunately, she is captured by the GC and taken to prison.  Forced to endure questioning by the GC, Chloe remains steadfast to her friends and family through God's help.  Frustrated at not receiving any information from Chloe, the GC decides to move her to a maximum security prison to be executed.<br />Meanwhile, a plague of darkness has engulfed Nicolae Carpathia's headquarters in New Babylon.  None of the unbelievers can see, and each is suffering from constant pain.  However, the members of the Trib force are unaffected by the plague and use this time to dig up some information on Carpathia's furure plans. It is decided that, since the safe house in San Diego has been compromised, the Trib Force members should fly to Petra.  <br />What will happen to Chloe and the remaining members of the Tribulation Force?  Will they survive to see the coming of Christ?<br />This book is excellent.  I've read each of the previous books in the series, and this one rates as one of the best.  After the previous book, I was afraid that this book would not be as good as the earlier volumes, but it definitely is.  The story is truly exciting and the pace flows along rapidly.  Of course, there is a cliffhanger at the end that will have to hold everyone over until next spring when the 12th and final volume is released.  I can't wait.  If the final volume is as good as this one is, then it will have been well worth waiting for.  I highly recommend this book.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.	2003-05-02

This book is the story of Major Charles Sweeney, the pilot who commanded the Nagasaki mission. <br />Major Sweeney had risen through the ranks of the Army Air Corps, becoming proficient in many different aircraft.  As fortune would have it, Sweeney met Colonel Paul Tibbets, who was in charge of a top secret operation.  Immediately intrigued, Sweeney spoke with Tibbets and asked if he could be assigned to Tibbets' unit.  Tibbets agreed, and eventually Sweeney would become Tibbets' right hand man.  Stationed at Wendover, Utah, Tibbets put his men through a rigorous training course.  His men became experts in the flight and operations of the B-29, as well as techniques designed by Tibbets.<br />Finally, the group left Wendover for Tinian island.  This would be their new base of operations.  Training continued, and on August 6, 1945, three B-29s lifted off the runway bound for Hiroshima.  Tibbets piloted the bombing plane, the Enola Gay, while Sweeney flew one of the reconnisance aircraft.  (Sweeney was the only person to be invloved in both atomic missions).  At 8:15 on August 6, 1945, a single bomb fell from the Enola Gay and vaporized the city of Hiroshima.  However, the Japanese did not surrender.  Three days later, a second mission, commanded by Sweeney, again headed for Japan.<br />The target city was Kokura.  The weather aircraft flying ahead of Sweeney's plane reported clear weather over Kokura, the primary target, and Nagasaki, the secondary target.  However, fires from a nearby city which was bombed the night before began to obscure Kokura.  By the time Sweeney and his crew arrived, the city was covered by smoke and clouds that had rolled in.  Sweeney had strict orders to only bomb visually; no radar drops.  Sweeney made three passes over the target; an almost unheard of tactic.  Still, the smokeand clouds did not dissipate.  Low on fuel because a mechanical malfunction had resulted in 600 gallons of fuel being trapped in the bomb bay, Sweeney headed for the secondary target of Nagasaki.  Sweeney was informed that he would only have enough fuel for one pass over Nagasaki.  Upon arrival, Nagasaki was also cloud covered.  Sweeney had made up his mind to drop by radar, but the clouds parted sufficiently for the bomb to be sight-dropped, although they were not over the primary aiming point.  The drop was successful, but now the crew had to worry about their fuel situation.  Thanks to some skillful flying by Sweeney, the crew managed to land their plane safely on Okinawa with only seven gallons of fuel to spare.<br />I enjoyed this book, but the beginning is kind of slow, and I think Sweeney held Tibbets in almost God-like reverance.  However, the description of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is very good.  For more information on Paul Tibbets, I recommend the book \\"Duty\\" by Bob Greene.	2003-04-23

Their target: Tokyo.  Conceived by President Roosevelt and commanded by Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle, this raid was designed to strike back at the Japanese as well as avenge the Pearl Harbor attack.  The Hornet was supposed to cruise to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast, but the task force was detected by Japanese fishing boats while they were still over 600 miles from their target.  Doolittle wasted no time in launching his strike, all the while knowing that it would now be virtually impossible for the planes to reach their pre-arranged landing sites in China.  Although the damage done to Tokyo was slight, the psychological impact of the raid on the Japanese military was considerable.  The raid forced the Japanese to keep more of their planes in the home islands for defense and also sped up the planning for the ill-fated Midway campaign in which the Japanese navy would lose four aircraft carriers.<br />This book does a good job of describing the planning involved in the attack as well as the attack itself and the subsequent aftermath for the crews. However, there are some factual mistakes, and  I felt that the section dealing with the actual bombing could have had a little more detail, and only one chapter really delved into the eight crew members who were taken prisoner by the Japanese.  Only four of these men made it home.  Three were executed by the Japanese and one died in prison.  I would have liked to have seen a little more attention in this area. The part of the book dealing with the plane which landed in Vladivostok, the internment of its crew, and their subsequent escape to freedom through Persia is a definite high point.  I was mesmerized by these men's heroic efforts to regain their freedom.  I also enjoyed the final chapter which gives a brief synopsis of the major personalities involved with the raid and how their lives during and after the war played out.<br />I recommend this book for the following reasons.  I enjoyed the recollections of the surviving raiders very much.  Hearing the description of the raid from the men who actually participated in it made the book much more enjoyable.  Also, the book flows in a manner which is easy to read and understand. Although technical, it is not so much so that the reader becomes bogged down. <br />For more information on the Doolittle raid, I would also recommend &quot;The Doolittle Raid&quot; and &quot;Four Came Home&quot; by Carroll V. Glines.	2003-04-09

Greene's father served as an infantry soldier in Italy, while Tibbets was training his men in Wendover, Utah for a mission which would hopefully end the war.  <br />Tibbets and Robert Greene, Sr. lived in the same town in Ohio, but had never met.  Bob jr. writes about how his father would speak of Tibbets and call him \\"the man who won the war\\". While Bob jr. was back in Ohio to be with his dying father, he drew on his memories of Tibbets.  Finally, Bob went to meet Tibbets.  What occured was the beginning of an unlikely friendship that spanned a generation and allowed Bob to discover things about his father and his father's generation that he never understood before.  <br />Bob found Tibbets to be a very honest and straight-forward man.  There was no nonsense from him; everything was in plain terms.  Tibbets talked frequently about his mission to Hiroshima on that fateful day in August, 1945.  He said several times that he had no regrets for what he did and he always slept easy at night.  Tibbets' stories enabled Bob to see that his father and many other men just like him also played large parts in winning the war.  Tibbets never liked the phrase \\"the man who won the war\\".  He was always quick to give credit to the soldiers as the real heroes, just like Robert sr.<br />Perhaps my favorite part of the book is the several chapters which deal with the trip to Branson, Missouri.  Bob, Tibbets, Tom Ferebee (bombardier), and \\"Dutch\\" Van Kirk (navigator) took a trip to Branson over Memorial Day weekend and they were treated like conquering heroes by the public.  But what impressed me was the candor and openness that these men spoke with.  I learned a lot about the Hiroshima mission that I never knew before.  <br />I found this book a little slow at the beginning, but it definitely picks up over thesecond half.  Read this book and learn about the generation of men who won the war.	2003-03-26

Testimonials are included from both American and Japanese survivors of the attack.  Of particular interest to me was the story of Kichiji Dewa, a crew member of the submarine I-16.  He describes the launching of a midget submarine that they were carrying on their deck.  Pilot Haruo Yoshino's story of his torpedo attack on the USS Oklahoma is informative as well.  Also mentioned in the book is Kazuo Sakamaki, a crew member of one of the midget submarines that tried to enter Pearl Harbor.  Sakamaki's submarine was damaged and lost its way. After spending many hours trying to enter the harbor, Sakamaki and his other crew member were forced to abandon their submarine.  The crewman died, but Sakamaki made it to shore where he was captured by an American soldier.  Sakamaki became the first Japanese prisoner of World War II.<br />This book is very short, but it does contain some good information, and the pictures and maps are very good.  This is a good introductory book about Pearl Harbor, but I would recommend something larger for a more complete analysis of the attack.	2003-03-12

From the first American offensive at Guadalcanal to the final shots on Okinawa, McDonnell's interviews take the reader into the heart of combat in the Pacific.  Often graphic and touching at the same time, these interviews tell the reader firsthand what it was like to fight against the Japanese.  The soldiers often speak of the horrors of war, such as having a buddy die in their arms, seeing a fellow soldier break down mentally, or facing the atrocities of the Japanese, such as cannibalism of dead American soldiers.<br />The heart-felt interviews by these veterans were touching to read, and they brought a human element to the war.  Many of the vets said that they tried to never get too close to another soldier because of the risk of death, but inevitably, friendships were formed, and when someone died, it usually affected other soldiers in a very personal way.  Many of these men would cry like babies after losing a buddy, especially if his dying had saved someone else's life.  Uncommon valor was a common virtue amongst these men.  The vets spoke of men hurling themselves on live grenades to save their platoon or crawling great distances under enemy fire to rescue a wounded comrade. Compassion was also talked about by the vets.  American soldiers on Okinawa continuously helped the civillian population after the Japanese tried to use them as human shields to stop the Americans.<br />This book moved me in a way I've never felt by a book before.  I found myself grimmacing with every bullet wound and crying with the men as they discussed the death of a friend or some horrible act committed by the Japanese.  This book offers a perspective on the war which can only be told by the men themselves.  I highly recommend this excellent work.  The stories contained inside will truly move you, and I'm sure your emotions will come out as well.	2003-03-11

This book describes one alternative; the invasion of Japan itself.  The invasion was to take place in two assaults; one, scheduled for November 1, 1945, was to involve the southern Kyushu area while the other, scheduled for March 1, 1946, was to occur in the Kanto plain area near Tokyo.  After the island of Okinawa was secured in June, 1945, the Americans turned their attention to the coming invasion.  The Kyushu portion of the invasion had the endorsement of President Truman and the joint chiefs.  The invasion would have been on a scale never seen before.  Thousands of ships, planes, and men would land on Kyushu and begin their drive northward.  However, due to ULTRA intelligence intercepts, the Americans learned that the Japanese build up on Kyushu was much larger than expected.  Many divisions of men and upwards of 10,000 aircraft were poised to meet the Americans.  The Japanese were also prepared to meet the Americans on the beaches, differing from their customary approach of leaving the beaches uncontested and fighting it out inland.  If the Japanese defense of Kyushu failed, there would be little left to defend the Kanto plain with, so the road to Tokyo would be wide open.<br />The author takes the view that Japan was a defeated nation ready to surrender due to the blockade and bombing missions being employed by the Americans.  He points out that Japan had virtually no navy or air force and that the remaining elements of the imperial army were so poorly fed and equipped that they would be no match for the Americans.  I tend to disagree on some points.  The Japanese have always been fanatical fighters, and would be even more so if their home islands were invaded.  Furthermore, the kamikazes, if employed in force, could have done tremendous damage to the invasion force.  Inevitably, the Japanese would succumb to the Americans, but not beforethey inflicted serious damage.  Also, he points out that the atomic bombs were used to send a political message rather than an end to the war.  Again, he feels that the Japanese were a defeated nation ready to surrender, but the build up on Kyushu leads one to believe otherwise.  The atomic bombs, in my opinion were wisely used.  Yes, they caused great loss of life on the Japanese side, but the invasion would have cost many more.  Furthermore, the American public wouldn't have stood for a prolonged battle against the Japanese after the invasion.  They wanted the men home as soon as possible, and the invasion would have kept them fighting for at least another year.<br />Overall, I thought this book did a good job of explaining the logistics and construction of the invasion plans.  The organization is good, and the book is well-researched. It gives good information regarding a possible invasion, but little information about the atomic bomb.	2003-03-04

On the night of July 30, 1945, two torpedoes struck the unsuspecting cruiser, and she sank in less than fifteen minutes.  Almost 900 men managed to make their way into the water, but unfortunately for them, their ordeal was just beginning.  For the next four days, these men were to face conditions almost unimaginable to civillians.  The sun beat down on them mercilessly during the day, while at night, many fought hallucinations and sometimes each other.  Shark attacks were common, and many men lost their lives to these predators.  <br />Meanwhile at Leyte, no one thought to check on the status of the Indianapolis, for it was not customary to report the unarrival of combatant vessels.  If this rule had been modified or if any of the port authority personnel had thought to act on their own initiative instead of doing everything stictly by the book, many lives could have been saved.  In the end, only 316 out of a crew of over 1100 survived.  Captain Charles Butler McVay III was among the survivors, but if he had known what was about to transpire, he might have wished that he didn't survive.<br />After an inquiry by the Navy, it was decided that Captain McVay would be court-martialed for failing to steer in a zigzag pattern and for failing to give the order to abandon ship in a timely fashion.  The trial took place in Washington, and the prosecution brought the Japanese submarine commander who sunk the Indianapolis, Mochitsura Hashimoto, to testify against McVay.  He claimed that it wouldn't have mattered if the Indianapolis was zigzagging or not.  He still would have sunk her.  However, despite convincing testimony from surviving crew members as well as an American submarine expert, McVay was convicted for failing to sail in a zigzag pattern.  It was noted in the book that Hashimoto happened to surface his submarine atprecisely the perfect moment when the Indianapolis was visible against the horizon.  If Hashimoto would have waited even 10 minutes later, he wouldn't have spotted her.  Luck was on Hashimoto's side that night; not on McVay's<br />I was very impressed with this book.  The events leading up to the sinking and the sinking itself are described very accurately, but the part of the book that impressed me the most was the excellent coverage of McVay's court-martial.  Several chapters are devoted to the court-martial, and every aspect is covered.  I've read many books about the Indianapolis, and this one covers the court-martial phase better than any other.  The introduction and afterword by Peter Maas brings the reader up to date with events concerning the Indianapolis.  It was the opinion of many that McVay was used as a scapegoat so the Navy could cover up their own mistakes, and Maas mentions a boy named Hunter Scott, who did a history project about the Indianapolis.  After spending numerous hours interviewing survivors and lobbying members of Congress, his efforts to have McVay exonerated finally paid off.  Even with the exoneration, the Navy will still have a black mark next to it for the way Captain McVay was mistreated.  For more information on Hunter Scott's efforts, I recommend the book \\"Left for Dead\\", which deals with his efforts to have McVay exonerated.<br />\\"Abandon Ship\\" is a fine piece of naval history.  Read it and discover the tragic tale of the Indianapolis.	2003-02-20

He wanted to give something back to the fans of Chicago who had adored and revered him for so long, and this touching book is it.<br />Walter was the best running back ever to play the game, period.  He never ran out of bounds, he could run like a deer, catch like a wide receiver, throw like a quarterback, and block like a truck.  Coach Mike Ditka once said that when God wanted to make a halfback, he just chiseled a certain type of body and he gave it to Walter Payton.  Walter may not have been the fastest or strongest, but he was the best simply because he refused to lose and he worked hard to be the best he could be.<br />I have never read a book that touched me the way this one did.  At some points, I found myself on the verge of tears, while at other parts I found myself laughing out loud.  The lessons that Walter talks about can be applied to anyone in their own lives.  He believed that you should do your best at anything you set out to do, and if you don't succeed, at least you gave it your absolute best shot.  His love for family and especially children are shining examples of the type of person Walter was.  He never stopped signing at an autograph session until he had spoken to everyone.  Our athletes of today should use this as an example to live by.  Children were his passion.  He set up a foundation in Chicago that delivers toys and clothes to children at Christmas.  One year, they serviced over 50,000 children.  Just imagine that for a moment!<br />I truly enjoyed the way this book was formatted.  The trestimonials of such people as Mike Ditka, Jim McMahon, Roland Harper, Mike Singletary, and others offers insight into Walter the player as well as Walter the person.  The way the narrative was interspersed between the testimonials was extremely well-done.<br />I simply could not put this book down.  Once I started reading, I was hooked.  Just reading about Walter's courageous fight against his disease gave me inspiration and helped me realize that some of my so-called problems were tiny compared to what he went through on a daily basis as his disease progressed.  I especially enjoyed the last chapter, which contains the complete memorial speeches of Jarrett Payton, Eddie Payton, John Madden, Mike Singletary, and Mike Ditka.<br />Walter Payton touched countless numbers of lives with his humor, his charm, and his wit.  This book is a fitting reminder to the type of person that Walter was; no nonsense, straight-forward, and loving.  Read this moving book; you will surely enjoy it, and it will give you a different outlook on your own life, too.	2003-02-12

Attu and Kiska were occupied by the Japanese and the thought of them on American soil outraged many Americans back home.  Thus, a campaign was launched to retake them.  After some hard fighting, the islands were recaptured, but the Japanese managed to evacuate their garrison from Kiska right under our noses, much the same way they did at Guadalcanal.<br />Operation &quot;Galvanic&quot;, the invasion of the Gilbert islands, got underway in November, 1943.  The main objective was the island of Tarawa.  The island is completely surrounded by a dangerous coral reef, and the tides are very unpredictable as well.  It was against these obstacles as well as a dug in enemy that the Americans made their attack.  As fate would have it, it happened to be low tide when the Americans attacked, thus exposing the coral reef and forcing the landing craft to unload much further from the shore as was preferred.  The Marines had to wade as much as 800 yards to the beach under horrific fire from the Japanese.  The bombardment by the Americans did little to the well-fortified Japanese defenses, and they made the landings extremely costly for the Americans.  Although Tarawa was secured in less than a week, the Americans suffered terrible losses which shocked the folks back home.  However, the Americans now possessed an excellent air base to further their operations.<br />After the capture of Tarawa, the Americans moved to attack the Marshall islands, with the main objectives being Kwajalein and Eniwetok.  The lessons of Tarawa had been well-learned.  Both of these islands were subjected to a murderous bombardment by the American fleet and air forces, so the Japanese resistance; although spirited; was less effective here.  The Americans managed to capture these islands in under a week and were now a step closer to Tokyo.<br />As with previous volumes of this excellent series, Mr. Morison has included numerous maps and photographs to expand upon the text.  There are some good personal narratives in this volume as well.  I recommend this volume along with the others of this series.  It gives an excellent first-hand account of one of the early amphibious assaults by the Marines.	2003-02-06
US	50555753	R1OJEXHTFOYY4G	096677910X	413506198	The Last Great Ace : The Life of Major Thomas B. McGuire, Jr.	Books	5	13	13	N	N	An Outstanding Book About a True Hero	There is only one word to describe this book; TREMENDOUS!  Author Charles A. Martin has written a masterpiece of aviation history.  In this book, the reader is given insight into the life of Major Thomas B. McGuire, Jr.  who would end up as America's number two all-time ace with thirty eight confirmed (and many more unconfirmed) victories.  This book does a superior job of giving the reader insight into McGuire's life.  The first half of the book deals with McGuire from a young age until he entered flight training.  Some of the other reviewers of this book thought that the first half was a waste; I highly disagree.  Mr. Martin gives us insight into Tommy's youth and his upbringing, which in the end ultimately resulted in the kind of pilot and leader of men he turned out to be.  His upbringing had a major impact on the type of commander he was, and I applaud Mr. Martin for including the early years of McGuire's life.  Too often, biographers just concentrate on a specific area of a person's life.  I'm glad that I found out what type of person Tommy McGuire was when he was younger.  It's easy to see from his childhood how he grew to become such an effective leader.<br />The second half of the book deals with the actual combat life of Tommy.  From August 1943 until his untimely death on January 7, 1945, Major McGuire compiled a record which most fighter pilots only dream about.  He shot down thirty eight enemy aircraft; second only to his rival and friend Dick Bong's forty.  He also grew to be a highly respected leader, tactician, teacher, and friend.  Tommy was a fiery individual in combat, but he was a true friend to his comrades in every sense of the word and he always looked out for the well-being of everyone in his squadron.<br />I've read dozens of books about the Pacific war, but this book rates as one of my all-time favorites.  This is a true classic of aviation history.  Read it and discover the life of a true American hero.	2003-01-24

Richard B. Frank has produced an excellent book on this very topic.  The book begins by describing the terrifying fire bomb raid on Tokyo on the night of March 9-10 1945.  Hundreds of B-29 Superfortresses dropped incindieries on the Japanese capital.  Fueled by a wind that gusted upwards of 60mph, 15 square miles of Tokyo was reduced to cinders, as many as 100,000 Japanese were killed, and over a million were left homeless.<br />Dispite this terrible raid, the Japanese still fought on.  Many Americans, including General Marshall and Admiral Nimitz (who later changed his mind) believed that Japan must be invaded to secure surrender.  Thus, operation Olympic was put into action.  This operation called for a landing on the island of Kyushu on or about November 1, 1945.  A follow-up invasion, operation Coronet, was scheduled for March 1, 1946, to take place in the Tokyo area of Honshu.  Gaining their information from Magic and Ultra sources, the Americans were given an estimate of Japanese strenghts on Honshu, but the Japanese build up was just beginning.  Soon, the Americans would be facing a ratio of almost 1 American soldier to 1 Japanese soldier; a disasterous ratio for the invader.<br />Meanwhile, scientists working in the United States had successfully tested the first atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert.  Two bombs were available for use against the Japanese.  The first of these bombs, \\"Little Boy\\" was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945.  Actual figures differ, but at least 60,000 Japanese were killed in this raid.  Three days later, \\"Fat Man\\" was dropped on Nagasaki.  The results were not as devastating with this bomb because it had to be dropped by radar and thus missed its projected point of detonation by over a mile.  Still, over 30,000 Japanese died in this attack.<br />Even with the dropping of thebombs, there was no guarantee that Japan would surrender.  In the event of surrender, Japan wanted certain terms from the U.S. such as the right to disarm themselves, the preservation of the Imperial throne, no Allied occupation of Japan, and the right to oversee any war crimes trials.  The United States insisted on unconditional surrender, however, they finally agreed to allow the Emperor to remain on the throne.  Many believed that he sould have been tried as a war criminal. On the American side, there was no deviation from unconditional surrender.  Japan must surrender to the Allies without any conditions.<br />In final analysis, the dropping of the bomb saved numerous lives, both Japanese and American.  Losses on both sides would have been horriffic. An analogy used often in the book cites \\"twenty Okinawas\\"; this being the number of casualties on the American side alone.  Even with the dropping of the bomb, there were many in the Japanese government who still wanted to fight on.  It was only after the Emperor intervened that the surrender occurred, and fighting still took place in isolated areas well into September, 1945.<br />This is a well-researched book on the topic of the Japanese surrender.  Specifically, chapter twenty deals with the revisionist viewpoint that the Japanese would have eventually surrendered without the use of the atomic bomb, and Mr. Frank does an excellent job of refuting these claims, specifically pointing to the massive Japanese build up on Kyushu, and, through Ultra and Magic intercepts, learning that Japan intended to fight to the last man.  <br />I highly recommend this book.  The information presented within is excellent and gives the reader a true sense of what might have happened if the atomic bombs were not available or not used.	2003-01-10

The first of these battles was fought in the Coral Sea.  The Japanese wanted to invade Port Morseby and use that as a springboard for a futute invasion of Australia.  However, the Americans, with their top-secret code breakers, already knew the composition of the Japanese forces and where they planned to strike.  In early May, 1942, the two sides engaged each other.  The Coral Sea battle was the first sea battle fought where the opposing ships never saw one another.  This was a tactical victory for the Japanese due to the fact that the American carrier Lexington was sunk along with a destroyer and a tanker, but it was a strategic victory for the Americans, because the Japanese recalled their Port Morseby invasion force.<br />The most important battle of the Pacific campaign was fought less than a month after the Coral Sea battle at a tiny island known as Midway.  The Japanese hoped to capture Midway and use it as a springboard for a possible invasion of Hawaii or even the west coast.  Once again, Nimitz knew of the Japanese plan thanks to his wonderous code-breakers.  The Japanese launched a massive air assault from four carriers against Midway but failed to destroy the airfields.  Aircraft were left on the decks of the carriers waiting for a second strike against Midway when the American torpedo and dive bombers appeared.  The torpedo planes were slaughtered by Japanese fighters, but they didn't die in vain.  They pulled the Japanese fighters down to sea level and gave the dive bombers a clear shot at the carriers.  In a matter of minutes, three Japanese carriers were turned into blazing infernoes by accurately placed bombs.  The fourth enemy carrier was sunk the next day.  The tide had now turned against the Japanese.  Never again would they regain the offensive.<br />This book does a good job of explaining both of these important battles.  Important charts and maps are also included which made reading and understanding the battles much easier.  Also included are early submarine attacks against the Japanese, the story of the Aleutian campaign, which was designed by the Japanese in the hopes of luring the American forces away from Midway.  Fortunately, Nimitz recognized this as a feint and didn't bite.  The opening stages of the Guadalcanal campaign are also discussed.  The following volume in this series deals exclusively with Guadalcanal.  I recommend this fine work of naval history.  It will help the reader understand these two important battles and the role that they played in changing the course of the war in the Pacific.	2002-12-20

Rather than attacking each island individually, it became the policy of the United States to \\"hop\\" over some of the islands, thus leaving the defending Japanese to \\"wither on the vine\\".  In effect, they were completely cut off from reinforcement and resupply.  An excellent example of this tactic was employed against the great Japanese base at Rabaul.  With over 100,000 Japanese troops defending the area, the Americans simply captured the islands surrounding Rabaul and strangled it to death.<br />This excellent work by Samuel Eliot Morison tells the heroic tale of the battles fought in and around the Bismarcks.  Some of these battles included the battle of the Bismarck Sea, where the Japanese lost a dozen ships, thousands of men, and a large amount of aircraft, while the Americans lost only 5 planes.  Admiral Yamamoto's last flight is told in vivid detail, and the other invasions are brought to life, as well.  Interestingly, this campaign was fought largely without aircraft carriers.  Destroyers, Cruisers, and PT boats helped win the day for the Americans.<br />As with other volumes in this series, this book contains helpful charts and maps to help the reader.  I knew very little about this particular area of the Pacific campaign, but Morison's book opened a new chapter in the Pacific for me.  I highly recommend this book.  Its very helpful in describing the beginning of the long road toward Tokyo and final victory.	2002-12-11

John Ross has moved on to Seattle, where he has met and fallen in love with Stefanie Winslow, a strikingly beautiful woman.  Both of them work for a homeless shelter called Fresh Start.  Fresh Start is run by Simon Lawrence, a self-made man who has made it his life-long challenge to help the homeless.   Ross has renounced his vows to the Word.  Earlier, he suffered a traumatic personal experience.  There was a hostage takeover at a school, and fourteen children were killed.  Ross was foretold of this event in his dreams, but even though he thought he had everything figured out, the children were still killed.  He has blamed himself for this tragedy, as well as blaming the Word for not helping him.  Thus, he renounced his faith in the Word.<br />Meanwhile, back in Hopewell, Nest Freemark is visited by Ariel, a tatterdemalion sent by the Lady to help Ross.  Areil explains to Nest that John is in great danger and Nest must warn him.  Nest, now a student at Northwestern University, isn't sure what she can do, but she decides to go to Seattle.<br />Upon arriving, Nest finds her way to Fresh Start and immediately begins to feel ill.  She steps outside to get some air, but she recognizes where the sickness has come from; a demon.  Finally, Nest meets up with John and she explains to him how the Lady sent Ariel to tell her about him.  John dismisses everything, saying he's perfectly happy with his life the way it is now and he has no intention of going back to being a Knight of the Word.  He still blames himself for the death of the children.  <br />Ariel then tells Nest that she's discovered a sylvan guarding one of the parks, and they go to meet him.  Unfortunately, the demon found out too and he is there as well.  Nest is forced to flee back into town away from the demon.  She vows to herself to stay in Seattle to see everything through to the end, but will she be able to convince John before its too late?<br />I found this book to be very good.  The characters are brought vividly to life by Brooks, and its easy to allow oneself to become immersed in their fight for survival.  I thought Brooks went a little overboard with his discription of every square foot of Seattle, but he more than makes up for it by weaving a genuinely exciting tale.  I highly recommend this excellent work.  It will leave you wanting more.	2002-11-15

This book is truly exciting and left me on edge throughout.  In this installment, he focuses on the group of adventurers after the destruction of Antrax, the evil magical force from book two.  Druid Walker Boh has been left mortally wounded from his encounter with Antrax, and the Ilse Witch was forced to confront her evil doings by the Sword of Shannara.  The Witch, who has finally accepted that she is Grianne Ohmsford, Bek's sister, withdraws deep within herself after seeing the vision in the Sword.  She is unable to forgive herself for what she had become and completely shut herself off from everyone, including Bek. However, Bek is determined to break through to her and release her from her trance-like state. Meanwhile, the evil Morgawr, a magical creature thousands of years old and the trainer of the Ilse Witch, has commandeered a fleet of airships to seek out the Witch and destroy her. He will stop at nothing until the Witch is either dead or he has sucked the lifeforce from her. There are many adventures throughout as the Morgawr attemts to capture the Witch and as the group tries to escape.  The airship battles are told in vivid detail, as well as the various encounters the group comes upon. <br />The book is excellent.  I could not put it down.  It is loaded with action and adventure on every page and left me wanting more.  The ending is a real cliff hanger and sets the stage for the next trilogy, which is due to start next year.  I highly recommend this book. It is a fitting conclusion to the \\"Voyage\\" trilogy.	2002-10-31

I've read dozens of books on the Pacific theater of operations, and this book ranks as one of the best.  Bergerud covers every miniscule aspect of the air war right down to the types of diseases faced by the men.  Each chapter is brilliantly written, and, with the inclusion of excellent personal narratives by both American and Japanese veterans, Bergerud brings the action in the South Pacific to life in a compelling and edge-of-your-seat narrative.<br />I learned many new things by reading this book.  For example, Bergerud points out the difference between a radial and an in-line engine and explains the pros and cons of each in an easy to understand format.  Also, all of the intricicies of both the Japanese and American aircraft are explained in amazing detail.  Although outclassed at the beginning of the war by the Japanese Zero, Bergerud describes, with the help of the excellent narratives, how American fliers were able to compensate for their inferior aircraft by using superior tactics to even the playing field.  Overall, Bergerud points out that although Japanese aircraft ran wild at the beginning of the war, it was only a matter of time, due to superior training, tactics, and, ultimatley, greatly superior aircraft, until the Americans gained the upper hand and strangled the Japanese to death.<br />The most interesting part of this book in my view are the excellent narratives given by the Japanese and American pilots.  These first hand accounts give the reader a sense of actually being in the battle, and they greatly enhance the book in terms of understanding the author's points.  They are hauntingly vivid and give a sense of what it was really like to fly a fighter or bomber over the Solomons.<br />All aviation and World War II readers will definitely enjoy this fine work of aviation literature.  I highly recommend it.  Read it and watch the air war in the South Pacific come to life.	2002-10-21

Despite the objections from Admiral Nimitz, Admiral Ernest J. King, chief of U.S. Naval Operations, insisted that the court martial proceed.  What occurred was one of the most incredible cases of injustice in U.S. Naval history.  McVay was convicted for failure to steer in a zigzag pattern.  This manuver is supposed to make a ship more difficult to hit in case of a torpedo attack, although this theory was completely disproved during the trial.  The Japanese captain of the submarine which sunk the Indy was brought in to testify against McVay.  It was his opinion that he still would have sunk the Indy regardless of the zigzagging. Another charge of failing to order abandon ship in a timely fashion was overturned.  The survivors of the Indianapolis always felt that their captain was used as a scapegoat by the Navy to cover up their own mistakes, and they have spent years trying to clear their beloved captain's name.<br />In 1996, a young boy named Hunter Scott was watching the movie Jaws.  One of the characters in the film portrayed a survivor from the Indianapolis.  After seeing the film, Hunter became more interested in the story of the Indy.  He used its story as a theme for a history project he was working on. This 11-year old boy did the unthinkable.  He made it his goal to clear McVay's name.  He sent out numerous questionnaires to survivors and conducted personal interviews as well.  Newspapers picked up on Hunter's crusade and soon the whole country was aware of his efforts.  Appearances followed on Late Night with David Letterman as well as trips to Capitol Hill to lobby members of Congress.  A meeting with the Senate Armed Services Committee took place on September 14, 1999.  Hunter, with the help of Senator Bob Smith, told the tale of the Indianapolis and her survivors to the committee.  By the time they were finished, they had swayed Senator John Warner, chairman of the committee.  He now felt that McVay should be exonerated.  The Senate resolution passed in October of 2000, but on July 11, 2001, Hunter received the news that McVay had been exonerated.<br />Author Pete Nelson does a fine job of telling the story of the Indianapolis, her sinking, the struggle for survival, and the exoneration.  I've read numerous books about the saga of the Indianapolis, but this is the first one I've read that explains the efforts of Hunter Scott.  This is a truly moving book.  We are lucky to have people such as Hunter Scott, who sacrificed so much for a person he never even met.	2002-09-24

Born in March, 1914 and raised in St. Louis, Butch loved the simpler things in life.  He enjoyed spending time with his father hunting or fishing, or playing with his younger sisters.  Family was always important to Butch, and the authors do a good job of stressing this throughout the book.   Butch eventually left St. Louis and attend Annapolis, graduating in 1937.  Butch's first assignment was aboard the battleship New Mexico, and he quickly developed an affection for the ship's float planes.  After serving aboard the New Mexico, Butch signed up for flight training and was stationed at Pensacola, Florida.  There, Butch earned his wings.<br />Butch's most famous flight occurred on February 20, 1942.  Butch was on board the carrier Lexington when a group of Japanese torpedo planes attacked the task force.  Butch scrambled his F4F Wildcat fighter off the deck and rose to meet the enemy.  In the span of about 5 minutes, Butch single-handedly shot down 6 of the attackers while saving the task force from certain damage.  Butch was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Roosevelt at a ceremony at the White House.  Afterward, Butch embarked on a war bond tour where he visited factories and gave rally speeches.  While on a visit to Grumman, Butch was able to talk to designers about the limitations of the F4F.  This input led to the development of the F6F fighter, which Butch would fly later in the war.<br />The authors do a good job of describing in great detail Butch's war days.  I felt like I was flying right along with him.  Particularly interesting was the detailed description of Butch's final flight.  After attacking a group of Japanese planes, Butch's night fighter group was to regroup and head back to their carrier.  However, a series of unconfirmed and sketchy events occurred which led to the death of Butch. Some people believe that Butch died as a result of friendly fire,while others believe that a snooping Japanese plane managed to get close enough to shoot Butch down without being detected.  The authors claim the latter, and I agree with their assessment.<br />Butch O'Hare was a true war hero.  His bravery and courage were shining examples to others, and his heroism was a true morale booster during the dark early days of the war.  A replica of Butch's F4F stands in O'Hare airport, named for him, in Chicago.  Read this excellent book and experience the life of a true American hero.	2002-09-11

The World Wonders	The battle of Leyte Gulf was the largest naval battle of World War II and for all practical reasons, the end of the Japanese navy as a fighting force.  Kenneth Friedman has done a superior job of describing each encounter that took place between the Japanese and Americans off the Philippines. <br />The goal of the Japanese was to destroy the American troop ships anchored off of Leyte.  They devised a bold plan to trap the Americans in a pincer movement.  One force was to steam through the San Bernadino Strait and attack from the center, while a second group was to attack from the South out of the Surigao Strait. A 3rd force consisting of the Japanese carriers attempted to lure the bulk of the American carrier strength North from the Leyte beachhead, leaving it virtually defenseless.  American submarines spotted the Northern force and sank 2 haevy cruisers.  The force reversed course, but did not retreat, much to the later surprise of the Americans.  Meanwhile, a group of American battleships, some of them Pearl Harbor veterans, thoroughly destroyed the Southern force.  However, the center force had regrouped and continued through the San Bernadino Strait.  The only force the Americans had guarding the beaches were 3 light carrier forces under the command of Admiral Clifton Sprague.  What transpired over the next couple of hours can only be described as a naval miracle.  Using sheer courage and excellent tactics, the tiny carriers managed to hold off a force consisting of battleships and heavy cruisers and kept the beachhead safe.  Meanwhile, Admiral Halsey's tactics were severely scrutinized.  He took the Japanese bait and led his entire force of fast battleships and fleet carriers north to attack the Japanese carriers while leaving the Leyte beachhead virtually defenseless. This prompted Admiral Nimitz to send his famous message: \\"Where is Task Force 34?  The World Wonders\\".  If not for Sprague's heroics, the outcome of this battle could have been much different.<br />I thought this book was very well written.  The author included many tables and charts which helped me understand the battle much better.  Perhaps my favorite part of the book was the story of Sprague's escort carriers.  The author credits Sprague with saving the day for the Americans.  I would highly recommend this book.  It flows along at a good pace and does a good job of explaining one of the major battles in U.S. Navy history.	2002-08-26

In &quot;The Remnant&quot;, the Jews gathered in Petra have been attacked by Carpathia's forces.  Miracuously, the Judah-ites survive after having two bombs and a missile fired at them.  Carpathia of course blames the pilots when in reality, God was protecting his chosen people.  <br />The story moves on to the rescue of Sebastian by Chloe and Mac, which, in my opinion, took up too much space in the book.  Jenkins and LaHaye must have dragged this episode out for well over 100 pages.  I wish this incident could have been wrapped up more quickly and more time spent on other events.<br />I also had a hard time keeping track of all of the characters, old and new.  I would hate to guess how many different ones there are now.  Hopefully, not too many more will be introduced in the following volumes.<br />In the last 2 chapters (38 pages), the authors cover approximately 1 year of time.  I felt this was too much time to cover accurately in such a short space.  As I stated earlier, they devoted approximately 100 pages to the rescue of Sebastian which took nowhere near 1 year.  I wish they would have spaced things out a little more evenly.  The last judgements are just touched upon and they are not allowed much detail.  The authors should have spent a little more time and a few more pages with this part of the book.<br />Overall, I did enjoy this book.  I have come to like LaHaye's and Jenkins' style of story telling very much.  Although I do recommend this book, I hope the ones to follow are a little better laid out than this one was.	2002-08-08

If completed, the Japanese would have access to vital American supply lines, as well as Australia and New Guinea.  In response to this threat, the United States launched thier first major offensive of the Pacific war.  Samuel Eliot Morison was commissioned by President Roosevelt to write the official naval history of World War II, and he does an excellent job of telling the story of Guadalcanal, where, according to the author, \\"the navy saw more fighting than in any three previous wars\\".  From the opening shots of the debacle of Savo Island, where the Allies lost four heavy cruisers, to the Japanese withdrawl in February of 1943, Morison covers every major battle of the Guadalcanal campaign. Notable engagements covered include The Battle of the Eastern Solomons, The Battle of Cape Esperance, The Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, and the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal.  He also includes a breakdown of forces involved in each battle, as well as numerous maps and photographs which I found very helpful as a reader. This battle was deemed the turning point of the Pacific war, and Morison does a good job of covering the major aspects of the battle.  For further reading, I would also recommend \\"Guadalcanal\\" by Richard B. Frank.	2002-07-22
US	50555753	R1NWEI7R06V2RR	0140159096	656167052	Pearl Harbor: The Verdict of History	Books	5	44	55	N	N	Totally Refutes the "Revisionist" Viewpoint	Over the years, there has developed a \\"revisionist\\" group of historians who claimed FDR Knew in advance about the impending attack on Pearl Harbor and he did nothing to stop it.  In this excellent book by Gordon Prange, this somewhat questionable viewpoint is thoroughly destroyed.  One of the revisionists' claims is that the radio stations on the West Coast were able to track the Japanese fleet due to their radio signals.  This is impossible, since the Japanese fleet NEVER broke radio silence, and, in fact, had their transmitters removed from thier radios all together.  Mitsuo Fuchida, the pilot who led the attack, also said that \\"the force maintained the strictest radio silence throughout the cruise\\".  Revisionists also believed, according to Prange, that if the Japanese task force would have been discovered, it would have turned back.  Again, this is not true.  The Japanese hoped to attain surprise, but if they were to have been discovered, they were prepared to fight all the way to Pearl Harbor to deliver their attack.  What Prange attempts to achieve in this excellent book is who really was to blame?  In this aspect, the War Department and the commanders, Kimmel and Short, are held responsible.  Prange comes down hard on the War Department for failing to notify the commanders of the intercepted \\"bomb plot\\" message.  This message, intercepted by \\"Magic\\", was transmitted to Japan by a Japanese spy.  It broke Pearl Harbor into several sections, which, in effect, could be interpreted as a bombing grid.  This information was not transmitted to Kimmel and Short, and could have proven invaluable.  But the bulk of the blame appears to fall on Kimmel, Short, and the subordinate commanders.  Kimmel and Short both grossly misinterpreted the \\"War Warning\\" message dated November 27, 1941, and sent to them by Washington.  Short only alerted his troops against possible sabotage and maintained his training schedule.  The War Department is also to blame here, because they failedto follow up to make sure Short understood the meaning of the message.  Kimmel also failed to grasp the meaning of this message, and, unfortunately, communication between the army and navy was poor at best, so very little information was shared between the commands.  One must also realize, and Prange makes excellent reference to this in the book, is that the Japanese placed tremendous amounts of time, thought, and training into this mission, and they must be credited with the success of the attack.  America's belief of their huge superiority in both ships and personnel was totally destroyed.  Prange also covers each of the resulting investigations fully and includes excellent testimony throughout the book.  In summary, this is an excellent book about the aftermath of Pearl Harbor and does a good job of refuting the revisionists and acurately placing blame.	2002-07-08

Six ordinary men, who in one moment frozen in time have become etched in our minds forever.  These are the men who triumphantly raised the flag on Mt. Surabachi.  James Bradley, the son of Jack &quot;Doc&quot; Bradley, has done a magnificent job of telling the story of these ordinary young men who in the face of battle became heroes. They came from ordinary backgounds, left their families, fought and, ultimately, died for thier country.  Mr. Bradley examines the life of each of the flagraisers, from Ira Hayes, the Indian, to his own father Jack Bradley, who wanted nothing more than to open a funeral home in his hometown.  The strain of the three survivors of the war, Hayes, Bradley, and Gagnon, is brought to life as they cris cross the country attending various galas and services.  Ultimately, Hayes has numerous brushes with the law and ends up in prison, where he ultimately dies.  Meticulousy written in a style that cannot be put down, &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; is destined to become, in the words of Stephen Ambrose, &quot;One of the Best Battle Books Ever&quot;.

Mr. LaVo writes with the style of a novelist and keeps the reader on edge throughout this exciting story of the Squalus and Sculpin.  He starts his story with the ill-fated test dive of the Squalus.  A valve is mistakenly left open, although it shows as being closed on the control panel.  Thousands of gallons of sea water pour into the open hatch and the sub plunges to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.  Thirty Three men survived the sinking, but they are trapped on the ocean floor.  &quot;Swede&quot; Momsen, inventor of the submarine rescue chamber, and his crew are summoned to the sunken submarine.  Thanks to incredible human effort, the thirty three crewmen are successfully rescued and the submarine is rasied and refitted.<br />Perhaps the best part of this book is the story of the war patrols of the Squalus (now re-named Sailfish) and Sculpin.  Mr. LaVo does an excellent job telling about the numerous war cruises of each submarine.  Both ran up an impressive list of enemy ships sunk or damaged.  The testimonies of the crewmembers are skillfully blended into the author's narrative and they give the reader a sense of actually being on the submarine.<br />An ironic twist of fate will forever seal these submarines together in history.  The Sculpin was sunk by a Japanese destroyer, who picked up the survivors from the submarine.  They were taken to the Japanese naval base at Truk, where they were transferred to the aircraft carriers Chuyo and Unyo for transport to Japan.  The Sailfish intercepted the Chuyo and sank her with torpedoes.  All but one of the Sculpin survivors was killed.  Twenty survivors were aboard the Unyo and made it safely to Japan, where they were interred, under horrible conditions, for the remainder of the war.<br />Written with great knowledge and a true sense of suspense, this book belongs on any World War II or submarine enthusiasts' bookshelf.  I also recommend &quot;The Terrible Hours&quot;by Peter Maas for more reading about the Squalus.	2002-06-13
US	50555753	R28JF6MHHUJTG3	0312286902	408379748	The USS Arizona	Books	2	10	13	N	N	Disappointing	I should have followed the advice of my fellow reviewers. I was extremely disappointed in this book.  I have read many books about Pearl Harbor and the Arizona, and this has to be the worst.  There are many factual mistakes in this book.  For example, the authors state that there was no lull between the first and second Japanese attack waves.  This is simply untrue.  In fact, there was about a twenty minute lull between the first and second waves.  This allowed the Navy to unlock the ammunition and to fight back.  Hence, the Japanese suffered their greatest losses in the second wave due to the lull.  The authors also state that \\"luckily, no American planes were shot down\\" by friendly fire.  Again, this is untrue.  The USS Enterprise was returning from delivering fighters to Wake island and launched several SBD Dauntless dive bombers to scout ahead and land on Ford Island.  Indeed, several of these were shot down and several pilots and crewmen were killed due to overanxious American gunners.  Finally, the authors say that a dive bomber dropped the bomb wich ultimately destroyed the Arizona.  Untrue.  The bomb was dropped by a high-level bomber.  The bomb was too heavy to be carried by a dive bomber.<br />There was also too much repetition in the book.  I grew tired of hearing how many different men shined the decks or worked in the messhalls. <br />I did learn a few things from the book.  I was unaware that both the Captain of the ship and the battleship division admiral were killed on the bridge during the attack.  Also, some of the survivors did give excellent personal renditions of life aboard the Arizona and the attack itself.<br />However, overall, I was disappointed in this book.  There are much better books available on the Arizona and Pearl Harbor than this one.	2002-06-04

In World War II, the B-17 was known as a \\"glamor plane\\".  It received all of the attention and it was the plane that everyone wanted to fly.  But thanks to Ambrose's excellent narrative, I realized that the B-24 was just as important in the bombing campaign against Germany. The B-24 was faster, carried a bigger bombload, and had similiar armament to the B-17.<br />I particularly enjoyed the stories of the crews who flew these big bombers.  The book focuses on George McGovern's crew, and follows these boys from flight school all the way to the surrender of Germany.  They were a very close crew, and the enlisted men especially looked up to McGovern.  Ambrose writes about a particular instance in the book where a bomb got stuck in the rack and would not fall.  Finally, the crew is able to jar the bomb loose, but to the crew's horror, it falls directly on a farmhouse at noontime.  McGovern is haunted by this unfortunate accident throughout the war, but McGovern was actually able to meet the people that lived in the house after the war and found out that everyone was fine.<br />Filled with action and excellent narration, The Wild Blue is definitely worth reading.	2002-05-29

Indianapolis	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Leaves Out Some Important Details	I've read several books about the sinking of the U.S.S. Indianapolis, and I would rate Ordeal By Sea as only average.  Mr. Helm does a good job of explaining the sinking itself, and the story of the survivors in the water is well-done, but some aspects are either complelely left out, or they are barely mentioned.  These events, such as McVay's request and subsequent denial of a destroyer escort, failure to alert McVay about the recent sinking of an American destroyer along his proposed route, the ignoring by the navy of an intercepted message from the I-58 stating that she had sunk an American battleship,  and the huge mess up regarding the departure and arrival of the Indianapolis are barely touched upon.  Also, Mr. Helm devotes only a few pages of text to McVay's court martial procedure.  While the book does a good job of telling about the sinking, abandoning, and struggle of the survivors, I was disappointed about the omission of the vital events leading up to the sinking. However, the author of the afterword, William J. Toti, does a good job of bringing the reader up to speed on the recent efforts by the survivors to get McVay's name cleared.  I would recommend &quot;In Harm's Way&quot; by Doug Stanton over this book.	2002-05-29

The plan was to launch B-25 Mitchell bombers from the deck of an aircraft carrier, bomb Tokyo, then fly to safety in China. In this excellent book by Carroll Glines, the story of the famed Doolittle Raiders unfolds.  President Roosevelt conceived the idea.  American morale was very low after the Pearl Harbor attack, and the President felt that an attack on the Japanese homeland would do wonders for the American civilians as well as the armed forces.  Colonel Jimmy Doolittle was selected to lead the mission.  Famous for his air racing and numerous speed records, Doolittle assembled sixteen crews and began training in Florida.  Finally, the planes were loaded aboard the U.S.S. Hornet and the task force set sail for Japan.  The original plan was to approach to within about 350 miles of the Japanese coast before launching, but a Japanese sampan discovered the task force while they were still some distance from the take off point.  I enjoyed the way that Mr. Glines told the individual story of each crew involved in the attack.  This aspect of the book made it much more enjoyable to read. The dialogue is so vivid that one can imagine themself sitting in the cockpit.  In the end, most of the planes successfully crash-landed in China, but eight men were taken prisoner by the Japanese.  They suffered horribly at the hands of their captors.  One man died in prison, three were executed by the Japanese, and four survived the war to return to the United States.  Another book, entitled Four Came Home, also written by Mr. Glines, tells the story of the four survivors in much greater detail than this book.  I would highly recommend both of these books as they both do an excellent job describing this first strike against the enemy.	2002-05-21

Most of the others deal mainly with the events leading up to the attack and the attack itself.  Mr. Clarke has chosen a different path with Pearl Harbor Ghosts.  He has concentrated on the evolution of Hawaii and Honolulu from the time of the attack to the present day and inserted lessons that may be learned from the attack.  Before December 7, 1941, Honolulu and the Hawaiian islands were nothing like they are today. Life consisted of working shortened days so that one could go to the docks to see an ocean liner off.  Lazy sugarcane fields and pineapple plantations covered the soil.  Life was much simpler.  But December 7 changed Hawaii from a tropical paradise into a modernized military outpost.  Gone were the lazy drives up winding roads to the beach.  The rule of the day now was working long hours to repair the damage done by the Japanese.  Americans and Hawaiians, as explained by the author, had developed a sense of arrogance.  No one in their right mind thought that a bunch of inferior people could attack the United States by surprise. We were, unfortunately, proven wrong.  One partiular aspect of this book which I especially enjoyed was the discussion of the Japanese islanders and thier treatment after the attack.  Many of the Japanese were rounded up and put in internment camps on the mainland.  Large numbers of the nisei (second generation Japanese) had joined the American armed forces, and now faced the horrible task of fighting an enemy that looked just like themselves. Others simply left the islands altogether.  Some of the nisei were simply discharged from their units after the attack and given no explanations.  After time, a full nisei Regiment was developed, fought in the European theater, and became the most decorated group in the war.  Still, even 60 years after that disasterous day, many American survivors still harbor ill feelings toward the Japanese.  Will these feelings ever go away for thesemen?  That is a difficult question to ask.  Meanwhile, Honolulu has developed like most other American cities.  Gone are many of the plantations and palm trees, having been replaced by shopping malls and skyscraper office buildings.  The dirt roads have been mostly replaced by interstates.  And the Pearl Harbor ghosts still linger for some of the survivors.  Will they ever be completely forgotten?	2002-05-21

A hatch which was shown to be closed on the sub's control pannel was left open and thousands of gallons of water poured into the submarine as she was executing a test dive.  The sub plunged to a depth of over two hundred feet.  Thirty three men out of a crew of fifty nine survived as the sub landed on the bottom, but no crewmen had ever been rescued from such a depth.  &quot;Swede&quot; Momsen, the developer of the Momsen lung and the submarine rescue chamber, was summoned by the Navy to assist in the rescue.  It is in this part of the book where Maas does his best work.  He tells Momsen's story with brilliant detail and puts the reader on the deck as the brave divers attempt to attach the diving chamber to the deck of the Squallus.  Due to the heroic efforts of Momsen and his crew, the thirty three survivors are eventually rescued.  But Momsen's work didn't end here.  These same men also accomplished the amazing feat of actually raising the Squallus to the surface and returning her to port.  This book describes in great detail the story of Swede Momsen and his heroic group of divers, who, despite over 600 individual dives, did not lose a single diver.  This book also points out Momsen's other contributions to the submarine community, such as the development of wolfpacks, where a group of three submarines hunted enemy shiping as a group, and the correction of the faulty  torpedo detonators which failed to explode.  Swede Momsen had a huge part in the development of the American submarine fleet, and this excellent book is a fitting tribute to him and his brave men.  I highly recommend this excellent book to anyone who enjoys submarines or good old fashioned heroism and courage.	2002-05-13

She was the pride of the submarine fleet and contained many features not found on older submarines, including air conditioning.  However, on Tuesday, May 23, 1939, something went terribly wrong.  A valve, which was shown to be closed on the submarine's contol pannel, was left open and thousands of gallons of sea water poured into the Squalus as she started one of her last test dives.  Fifty nine men were suddenly trapped at the bottom of the  Atlantic ocean.  Never before had surviving crewmen ever been rescued from a sunken submarine-until now. &quot;Swede&quot; Momsen, a U.S. Navy officer, risked his own life numerous times to rescue the trapped crewmen.  Momsen was the man who developed the Momsen lung, a breathing device which allowed crewmen to ascend to the surface by using controlled breathing techniques.  But perhaps his greatest achievement was the development of the submarine rescue chamber; a bell-shaped device which attached directly to the submarine over the hatch.  By using this apparatus, Momsen and his men were able to successfully rescue the thirty three men left alive in the submarine after she went down.  However, Momsen's job was not finished.  After the crew was rescued, attempts were made to raise the submurged Squalus, and Momsen's team was again at the forefront of these efforts.  On September 11, 1939-after over 600 individual dives and over 100 days after disappearing into the Atlantic, the Squalus was raised.  Momsen's contributions to the Navy did not end with this mission.  He helped correct the problem that submariners were having with the detonaters on their torpedoes by test firing them against a rock cliff and designing a new detonator.  Also, it was Momsen who came up with the idea of deploying submarines in &quot;wolfpacks&quot; to attack enemy shipping.  The results of these &quot;wolfpacks&quot; were devastating to Japanese shipping.  This is an excellent book of how a determined man and his crew risked their lives to save the lives of others.  If you enjoy submarines or just good hero stories, then read this excellent book.	2002-05-06

Although this book is short, the author does a good job of explaining the events leading up to the attack, and how this small force managed to take the Italians complelely by surprise.  Furthermore, the Japanese used this attack as a model for their Pearl Harbor operation.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Pearl Harbor.

There are several different points that the author makes in this book, but his main thesis is that Admiral Kimmel, Commander-in Chief of the United States Pacific Fleet, was denied valuable information which, in his mind, could have prevented or in the least alerted the U.S. forces to the impending Japanese attack.  The author brings up several points to prove his case.  For instance, Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner, chief of the war plans division, believed that Kimmel had in his possession a &quot;Purple&quot; machine, which could decipher the Japanese diplomatic code, and that Kimmel was reading all of the information that Washington was receiving.  This was not true. The Purple machine that was supposed to go to Pearl Harbor was instead sent to the British.  Admiral Stark and General Marshall are also singled out by the author.  No &quot;clear&quot; war warning message was sent to Kimmel by Washington, and on the Day of the attack, Marshall was out horseback riding and did not arrive in his office until approximately an hour before the attack began.  A warning was sent when he arrived, but it was delayed by atmospheric problems and could only be transmitted as a telegram.  Kimmel received this message about an hour after the attack began.  In retrospect, Washington must shoulder some of the blame for failing to keep its Hawaiian commanders informed, but Kimmel and his subordinates must share some of the blame as well.  For example, the author tells of the story of the Japanese submarine that was spotted and sunk off the harbor entrance.  Why was there no alert after this sinking?  Also, two army privates spotted the Japanese attack planes on radar while they were still over 100 miles from Pearl Harbor.  Still, no alert was issued.  This book also has excellent excerpts from the Congressional Hearings held in 1945-46.  Overall, I think this book is aexcellent, although short, examination of Kimmel and Washington.	2002-04-23

There are many photographs in this book that I have never seen before.  The captions that go along with each photograph describe in detail the action taking place in the photograph.  This book also makes an excellent companion to other books about Pearl Harbor that contain text.	2002-04-23

Mr. Weintraub has taken on the enormus task of not only describing the events of December 7, 1941 in regards to Pearl Harbor, but he examines the Day of Infamy on a world-wide scale. The reader finds themselves in the frozen Soviet Union as the Germans desperatley try to hold back the counterattacking Red Army.  In North Africa, Rommel is being harassed by the British at Tobruk. In Washington, the reader is taken inside the White House as Roosevelt writes his personal plea for peace to Hirohito. I thought that the chapter headings with a clock showing the time at different places in the world was a nice touch for the reader.    I have read numerous books on the subject, but never on a world-wide scope such as this.  I would highly recommend this book for Pearl Harbor readers. Another book that is similar to this one is Gordon Prange's December 7, 1941.	2002-02-08

As soon as I started reading I was hooked.  The hardships that the men of Bataan had to face at the hands of the Japanese were unbelieveable.  Hampton Sides tells their story in a way that draws the reader in and doesn't let them go.  The book's chapters alternate between the Death March in 1942 and the liberation in 1945.  I particularly enjoyed this format very much.  I haven't read very much about the Death March, but Mr. Sides brings this tragic event to life and makes the reader feel as if they are walking side by side with the prisoners.  We also see their liberation through the eyes of an extremely heroic group of American Rangers who, along with filipino soldiers and civilians, thwart the Japanese and free these American soldiers.  If you enjoy books about the Pacific war and human triumph, then be sure to read this excellent book	2002-01-25
US	50555753	R3FOHSVSDNJNW6	0805066322	236286596	In Harm's Way: The Sinking of the USS Indianapolis and the Extraordinary Story of Its Survivors	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	Tragedy at the End of the War	July, 1945.  The United States is mere weeks from victory over Japan.  In perhaps the greatest blunder by the Americans in the entire war, the USS Indianapolis is sunk by a Japanese submarine after delivering the parts to the atomic bomb.  Mr. Stanton does a good job of outlining the events leading up to the sinking.  For example, he points out that an American destroyer was sunk on the same route that the Indianaplois was scheduled to take to the Philippines only days before.  Also, no destroyer escort was given to the Indianapolis to protect her from the submarine threat.  Perhaps the biggest and most costly blunder was the fact that the Indianapolis was never listed as being \\"overdue\\" by the authorities in the Philippines after she failed to arrive on time.  This blunder cost over 800 men their lives.  The story of the sinking and the fight for survival in shark-infested waters are brought to life by Mr. Stanton.  For 4 1/2 days, the survivors battled hunger, thirst, sharks, hallucinations, and in some cases, each other.  Finally, the men were sighted by an American seaplane, and were ultimately rescued, including the captain, Charles McVay.  McVay was ultimately court-martialed in one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in the history of the U.S. Navy.  Overall, I thought this was a good book, but I was disappointed that only 1 chapter was devoted to the court martial hearings.	2002-01-25

Some are captured, and some have left to explore Castledown to find the magic books that are hidden there.  Bek has just discovered that the Ilse Witch is indeed his sister, Grianne.  The Ilse Witch refuses to believe this, and Bek struggles with how to convince her of the truth. Prince Ahren must also deal with his own shortcomings and try to find the missing elfstones. Meanwhile, Walker becomes separated from the others in Castledown and discovers Antrax, a 3000 year old presence which was built to keep the books of magic safe. It survives by feeding off the magic of others. Walker and the others are confused as to how Antrax operates, but eventually the secret of Antrax is discovered.

Ambrose takes us through the formation of Easy company in the summer of 1942 to the surrender of Germany in 1945.  The men of Easy are brought to life by Ambrose's excellent dialogue.  In 1942, Easy company was formed.  They trained in Georgia and learned the rigors of jumping from an airplane.  After becoming seasoned paratroopers, these brave men led the way at Normandy by jumping behind enemy lines before the main assult.  Ambrose vividly describes how Easy company destroyed a battery of German artillery while facing overwhelming enemy superiority.  Next came the siege of Bastogne.  Again Easy was at the forefront of the fighting; valiantly defending the town against vastly superior enemy numbers.  After the Normandy campaign, the men of Easy company participated in the largest parachute drop of the war; Operation Market Garden.  Although this was considered an allied &quot;defeat&quot;, the men of Easy company again distinguished themselves on the field of battle.  Finally, Easy company led the assult on Hitler's own &quot;Eagle's Nest&quot; in the last days of the war.  Ambrose brings each member of Easy company to life, from Major Winters, who was adored and respected by his men, to Captain Sobel, who was equally disdained.  This book is a must read for WWII enthusiasts.	2001-11-16

I found this book a little &quot;slow&quot; at the beginning, but as I read further, it picked up steam.  In this  installment, we are following Wren's charge from Allanon; restore the elves  to the Four Lands.  I must say that I wasn't too impressed with Wren in the  other 2 &quot;Heritage&quot; books, but Terry Brooks brings her to life in  this book. We follow her struggle to find her true identity and her task to  free the elves.  We are also introduced to Stresa, a splinterscat, and  Faun, a tree squeak, who become Wren's constant companions.  Wren also  finds out the terrible truth about the Shadowen and how they appeared.   Overall, this is another excellent book by Terry Brooks.	2000-07-05

The characters come to life and you actually feel that they are a part of you.  Again, the Ohmsford family is at the center of the story.   This time, the brothers Par and Coll, as well as Wren and Walker Boh, are  each given different quests by the shade Allanon, who has been dead for 300  years.  The Shadowen have appeared and threaten to destroy the Four Lands  unless they can be stopped.  Par is to find the legendary Sword of  Shannara, Walker is to find the Black Elfstone which will restore the  Druids, and Wren is to discover the missing Elves.  Other intriguing  characters are introduced, such as Padashar Creel, Steff, Teel, and Garth.   The action in this book is intense, and the characters come to life.  I  have read the first Shannara series, as well as the Landover series and the  Word and Void series, and this is book is one of the best.	2000-05-16

However, contrary to the title of the book, It details the life of the Yorktown from 1941 until June 1942.  Overall, this is a very good book.  I was particularly interested by  the personal stories and experiences of the crew members.  I do feel that  the book did not devote enough time to the battle of Midway.  There are  only about 120 pages or so that actually deal with the battle, while the  rest of the book covers the Yorktown's earlier service, hence the  &quot;confusing title&quot;.  There are other books available which go into  much greater depth, but this book does a good job covering the basic  aspects of the battle of Midway.	2000-02-03

Mr. Stinnett suggests that FDR knew that Pearl Harbor was going to be attacked and failed to notify Admiral Kimmel and General  Short.  Granted, the author points out that many of the Japanese intercepts  were only recently declassified by FOIA requests, and Kimmel and Short  never received these pieces of information, but the fact still remains that  admiral Kimmel DID receive the message of November 27 which reads  &quot;This message is to be considered a war warning&quot;.  What more did  he need to know?  Wasn't it spelled out clearly for him in those few words?   Also, why did General Short relegate himself to sabotage prevention  instead of preparing his forces for possible ariel attack.  I believe in  the final analysis that there are most definitely items that Kimmel and  Short did not receive, such as the bomb plot message, but I also believe  that FDR did not set up the Pacific Fleet to be a pawn to get the United  States into a shooting war with Japan.  I was left with new thoughts to  ponder after reading this book, however, because of the new information  released by the FOIA requests.  In the end analysis, I don't think we'll  ever know exactly what happened on that terrible December morning in 1941.	2000-01-26
