I liked the writing style and the composition of the book, namely the placing of reference books and authors in the text of the story as well as at the end.  However, there lacked something in the book that did not lend realism to their hypothesis.  It was a book that can be read to give one another view of the world and the hereafter, but it does not address the reality of what might exist.  The information in the book is far below that of PhD writings.  I bought the book expecting more than I got and I can see why used books are so much less than those that are new.  I would not recommend this book, unless you can pick it up for 50 cents at a book sale.	2005-04-08

It has all the rules for chopping your way to the top, but lacks the detail to make it happen.  In order to get to the other side of the river, someone can tell you to jump in and swim to the other side.  However, it is nice, a la Nicolo Machavelli, to have someone give you detailed instructions as to how to do it.  Like if you are half way across the rage filled river and find you cannot swim, what do you do.  The book, none-the-less, is a nice desk top or  pocket reference book to review your options during those times when you need a quick pick me up.  A nice buy.	2005-01-05

It was well written as to the use of words and sentences, having clarity and substance.  I swear Bill must have had his rolodex next to him as he wrote his book.  There are the most miniscule of names of people you would not think he would remember.  If I were to go to battle I would want Bill to be with me.  I feel I could trust him not to run away at a critical moment, but to stand up and make peace.  He is dynamic in his own being.  I wonder if he radiates the charisma that his words portray?<br /><br />I was sorry to learn that our government was so interested in itself at the expense of us citizens.  It is a wonder we are still a country.  This book will make you dislike all forms of politics and you will learn that you are really nothing to these politicians.<br /><br />I think Bill should have found out he needed to toot his horn more than he did.<br /><br />I do recommend reading this book with a pencil, ready to make comments in the margins.  My book is a mess of scribblings.  Bill has a well balanced piece of work that does not get stuck on one subject.  He does think he has to do everything, however, or it will not be done.  His problem, if there was a problem, was he tried to do to much in the alloted time.<br /><br />Jimmy	2004-10-14

I thought I might learn something about this sect of Islam, but I could see from the first several pages this was not to be.  PhD or not, it is written in a round about the subject as is normally the middle eastern way of presenting thoughts.  Such if we talk all around this subject we will be able to snow enough people to make them see our point.  Do not buy this book, even for a used price.

I purchased this book thinking I would have help in establishing myself in reclaiming my political power.  Afterall, all I can change is myself.  But, after<br />reading the first five pages or so, I was totally turned off by a very strong, right wing<br />tirade of why the liberals have ruined America and how the red necks of Texas were going to show me how to reclaim what I supposedly have lost.  I believe this is the very reason for the polarization of America.

When I received the book, I thought wow.  It is a glossy, hard cover (sort of) paperback.  It looked so promising. However, when I went to read the book I was flustered.  The author writes in sentences and word combinations that to me spell &quot;I don't know what I'm talking about so I'll use these  sentence structures so I look good&quot;.<br />Beyond this, I tried to understand his work.  He had no concrete  authority for some of his thoughts.  I do not think you can just espouse a theory without providing hooks to help it stand up to argument.  Really it is just a book of opinions written in gobbldy gook.<br />I do not recommend you buy this book or this author.<br />Jimmy	2001-05-14

An excellent book on Russian Political System and other systems as well.  This is a must read book along with your other reads concerning Russian history.

This book evidently is the result of a disertation as it has the typical structure of such a document.  It really needs to be read in conjunction with other books on Russian History to get its full impact.  It is highly documented with lots of notes.  It gives Russian history a new look, telling you why Russia had to do certain things.  It was very enlightening and well organized and written. I would give it a must buy recommendation.	2001-04-11

Mr. Gribbin starts out well for one half of the cat book.  He then drifts into other  areas which I suppose have a connection to the subject.  The second half of the book did not hold my attention; did not show me anything I could use.  It resulted in my not reading the kitty book.

What looked like a good book with average reviews proved to me to be slow and to disentangled.  The author jumps around to various  subjects trying to prove his idea of what reality is.

A well written history of this period that gave me nightmares. Since Lenin and his followers came to power, the Russian people have gone backwards 200 years.  I cannot believe the Russian  people are so stupid as to put up with this type of destructive government, even though the government says they are.<br />A book worth reading.  Why people will idolitize such leaders is beyond me.  A sad story of cruelty and downfall of the Russian people.<br />Jimmy	2001-02-21

So let me be as honest as possible. The big advantage of Magic Circle to me is that Oprah did not review it - WE did! In fact, I thought this was the only  book to deal with New Age topics that really riveted me. I agree with the  previous reviewer. It is like the Illuminatus Trilogy.	1999-08-30
US	52501897	R163KQ6KG00DNN	0316929190	838798147	All Too Human: A Political Education	Books	5	0	0	N	Y	Shades of Paul Erdman.	George has produced a good book about the goings on in the backrooms of politics. He talks alot about himself and how he thought and reacted. I have two puzzeling comments.  When these authors produce a manuscript do  they use the services of a literary guide to provide saleability of their  book?  George's written words do not sound like the George who appears on  many tv talk shows or political opinion shows.  He also has peppered this  work with words in strange places that require a dictionary to decipher.  This is not the way I have heard George talk. It is as if he were trying to  impress someone. Other than these two mysteries, the book is worth the  price if you like to know how politicals work and think. The book reminds  me of those written by Paul Erdman, but he did not use mysteriously placed  words.	1999-03-17

Definitly a work if you like philosophical logic.  It exhibits overkill in the area of research, but does not provide clear cut answers.  It uses the A is B, A is not B, etc. type of research.

A small in size book, being about 5 x 6.  It is printed on glossy paper with many photographs.  It is an exceptional buy for the amount of money tendered.  If you read anything by Mr. Carroll you have to have this book  too.  Mr. Carroll's work is a must for anyone writing anything.  The simple  truth is his writing means nothing  as far as plot, but his style is  brilliant.<br />Is there anyone out there that knows what the name of the  writing style used by Mr. Carroll.  For instance his characters are telling  a story to someone  small  Mr. Carroll aims his text at a small animal.  The small animal answers back in small type.

It has been said by many, that one cannot know a book by its cover.  In the case of &quot;The Annotated Alice&quot;, its cover will tell you milleniums of information.  Bigger than most hardcover reading books, it  has a nice feel.  Sorta like warm, quishly stuff.  The cover is exceeding  nice as hardcovers go, while the interior pages feel like well worn cotten  sheets on an often used bed, the texture handling my highlighter pencil  with ease.  The contents should score high on the Flesch reading scale.  Now about the contents of the book, as judged by its material presence can  not cause any dissatisfaction, as nonsense goes.  In short,  you cannot  have made a better choice of a book than this one.	1998-12-26

It is written using linguistics and etomology providing a lot of definitions of  Hebrew, Latin, and Greek words. May be the theme has something to do with  the fact that it states &quot;A means of Revelation in Ancient  Israel.&quot;  As it is copy writed in 1997, there should have been  comments about the UT in in todays religions, namely the LDS religion.	1998-12-03

Highly documented, as are all Mormon writings, it tells what happened at Carthage, Illinois.  The murder of Joseph Smith and his brother Hiram told minute by minute, identification of many personalities, and clear reporting  of the courst case.  The atmosphere and surroundings of this incident has  been repeated before and after, within societies that feel threatened by  something they do not understand.  Reading of this book will bring sorrow  to your heart, and a rememberance of Waco and other unfair reactions to  supposed threats.  Very good book, reporting in detail what happened.	1998-11-24

When I first received the book, I read through it relatively fast.  Much of the material went over my head.  However, on the second reading it was as if  the pages were illuminated.  In this book, Mr. Dewey gives his opinion on  how we humans learn.  It takes every day simple actions, breakes them up  into their smallest unit and discusses why we did it that way.<br />What have  I gained from this book?  Everytime I do something,  I attempt to break it  down into its simples being, and determining how this breakdown fosters  greater intelligence within myself.<br />As a text book or a book one wants to  learn something from, I give it five stars.  For just general reading it  will garner 1/2 of a star.	1998-11-24

I suggest if you buy this book, use it as a book end.  It is not a buy for $14.00.  I wish Mr. Crossan had stuck to material on which the book is entitled.
