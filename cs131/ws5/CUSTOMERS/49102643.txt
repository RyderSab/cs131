The very strength of this book is Olney's access - he covered the Yankees for The New York Times during the team's dynasty and downfall.<br /><br />In short, this book is must reading for even passive fans of baseball, no matter their allegiance - be it Boston, New York or otherwise - because what the Yankees do and who they acquire typically sends ripples throughout the baseball world, since they have so much money to spend and one of the strongest willed owners in sports, George Steinbrenner. Even for knowledgable Yankees fans, this book is a treasure trove of inside information about all of the Yankees stars - Pettite, O'Neill, Clemens, Rivera, Williams, Soriano, Jeter and even Joe Torre. Olney details all of their careers, from their time before the Yankees and what led them to New York. Where the author really shines is when he takes the reader behind-the-scenes, from clubhouse meetings to Torre's private thoughts about lineup decisions and players. Olney accomplishes with seeming ease what any good writer does - putting the reader in the clubhouse, manager's office or dugout. Another great aspect of the book is the Yankee meltdown in Arizona in the World Series, and he does it with inning-by-inning precision, weaving the Game 7 tale slowly throughout the book. This is good reading.<br /><br />But, where the book really excels is its passages on George Steinbrenner and his insatiable thirst for winning. Even after winning the World Series, the mercurial Yankees owner would enjoy the success for all of about 15 minutes, and then would almost immediately begin to schedule meetings at the Yankees' offices in Tampa to start work on next season. This hard charging style is what led to the Yankees' dynasty, but George's lusting for championships are also what led to its demise. When Steinbrenner deferred to his general managers, Brian Cashman and before him Bob Watson, and Joe Torre, generally sage moves were made to improve the roster and strengthen the Yankee muscle. However, when the Boss made a move of his own, starting with the resigning of David Wells against the advice of his baseball men late in the dynasty, it spelled the beginning of the end. The Wells signing paid off the following season - the pitcher had a very good year. However, Olney opines that the Boss got lucky with this move and that the Wells signing actually spelled doom for the Yankees, because it convinced Steinbrenner that he could make his own player decisions while largely ignoring the advice of his baseball men. The result: a current Yankee team with a barren farm system, high-priced free agents (read: A-Rod and Jason Giambi) who didn't come up in the Yankee system and who lack the chemistry and clubhouse camaraderie that fueled the dynasty years.<br /><br />The book concludes with an epilogue of the Red Sox shocking, come-from-behind victory over New York in the 2004 ALCS. That passage alone almost makes the book worth the purchase and read. Highly recommended for any baseball fan.to his general managers, Brian Cashman and before him Bob Watson, and Joe Torre, generally sage moves were made to improve the roster and strengthen the Yankee muscle.

Committed is a wonderful collection of testimonials from men about how they fell in love, and how they have stayed in love, in some cases for decades. In this book, 17 men let you in on their journeys of marriage, parenthood, fidelity and dealing with death in the family. Anyone, man or woman, who believes all men cheat, stray and lack the ability to stay monogamous should read this book and rejoice. Committed is proof positive that there are men who truly love their wives, and through the ups and downs of marriage, work hard at making their relationships last.<br /><br />This was terrific reading and a great gift I will TREASURE forever. Highly recommended, especially for a man who is on the brink of getting engaged, as I am.	2005-07-25

Prior to reading The Arrogance of Power, I shared the widely held view that RMH was one of the worst, contemptible, corrupt presidents in US history, but after reading the book, I'm firmly convinced more than ever that he sits firmly entrenched atop the list.<br /><br />Summers does a brilliant job of uncovering much of Nixon's underhandedness, from his abuse of alcohol, prescription drugs (including, shockingly, Dilantin, a drug which can have mind-bending effects if abused. I know this because a relative of mine suffered from a stroke and was prescribed Dilantin for seizures. Every pill placed her in another world.), his approval of black bag operations, illegal contributions from Howard Hughes and foreign governments, etc. Summers also explores the accusations of spousal abuse and Nixon's alcoholism, but to be honest, he doesn't seem to have rock solid proof here. But, this book is worth the read even without exploring those two topics.<br /><br />The author does a very good job, even to the point of repetition, on Nixon's misdeeds through his first term. And that thoroughness is backed up with a large number of interviews with critical players in this tragic play, along with evidence from the infamous Nixon tapes. Summers has produced a thoroughly researched book.<br /><br />But, I was pretty disappointed with his examination of Nixon's second term, the Watergate crisis and his decision to resign. The last 3-4 chapters of the book, ending with RMH's resignation, should have been the climax, and these sections of the book should have been exhaustive. Unfortunately, they are not. Still, Summers earns high praise for this tome. If you are looking for a complete bio on Nixon, this isn't it. Nevertheless, this book is a critical piece in an overall study on Nixon and is vital to understanding our most tragic and flawed of presidents. The Arrogance of Power is worth the time and effort. Summers misses at least 4 stars because of the lack of depth and breadth in the critical passages covering '73 and '74 on the road to resignation.nce of Power is worth the time and effort.

After reading this wonderful book from cover-to-cover in less than a week, I'm convinced that this book deserves all of the praise it has received, and more.<br /><br />\\"Truman\\" is the ultimate, complete package in a presidential biography. Even a novice of 20th century history (this writer included) would have a list of important events that he or she would want to read about in a Truman bio. McCullough covers them all, and in detail: the decision to drop the atomic bomb, FDR's death and the transition to the Truman administration, the Potsdam conference, the creation of the United Nations, the Korean War, the firing of MacArthur, the 1948 election, his decision to not run in 1952, etc. McCullough touches all of the bases beautifully.<br /><br />The highest compliment I can think to give McCullough for this book is the sense of balance in his writing and how he brings Truman to life. Mostly absent from this book, thankfully, is the rampant cheerleading and bootlicking that plague other presidential biographies. McCullough isn't a Truman admirer who puts a positive spin on every significant event during Truman's presidency. It's obvious that McCullough thinks highly of Truman, but he grapples with the controversies of Truman without softpeddling, unlike Stephen Ambrose's one-volume \\"Eisenhower: Soldier & President,\\" where Ambrose neglects important events and spends entirely too much time raining down praise on Ike.<br /><br />This thoroughly researched book presents Truman in a fair and balanced manner, and much of that research is based on Truman's diaries. \\"Truman\\" covers the president's bad decisions as well as his good ones, with the president's rationale behind those decisions.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and I believe it sits high atop the heap of the many available presidential biographies. McCullough is one of America's finest historians. Buy this book, read it, and in the end, be disappointed that it's over.be disappointed that it's over.	2004-12-28

It turned out to be one of the best decisions I've made about a book in years.<br /><br />I read the book in one afternoon for two reasons - it is a very short read, but, most importantly, it was too compelling and gripping to put down. Albom has written a brilliant interpretation about what happens to us in the afterlife, and even though it's a novel, his writing and message resonated strongly with my life and what I consider truly important. TFPYMIH is worth reading for that reason alone - any book that stops you in your tracks to think about how you are living your life is time well spent.<br /><br />I won't give away any plot details or how the book ends - the ending is both a surprise and a great joy. I found myself weeping during several points in this journey - I have a feeling that even the most non-emotional among us will well up inside in a few of the more powerful passages.<br /><br />Needless to say, I'm giving out three copies this Christmas alone, and I will probably give out many more in the years to come. Albom has written a classic, one-for-the-ages page turner. Any small, 200-page book that packs this powerful of a punch is worthy of high praise indeed. Buy it, read it and give it to friends and family to spread Albom's wonderful message.	2004-12-17

After thoroughly enjoying the movie, I had very high hopes for this tome, and I was not disappointed. This book is a stunner, bringing to life the horrific conditions and brutality that Wladyslaw Szpilman endured to survive six years of Nazi brutality in Warsaw, Poland.<br /><br />What's truly amazing about this book is how Szpilman tells the story with a sense of detachment - the barbaric killing that he sees up close; his final moments with his family, when he realizes shortly after they are gone that will never see them again; his bearing witness to the piles and piles of corpses; and mindless executions for some minor infraction, etc. Szpilman writes it all in stunning, unforgettable prose. It baffles the mind how he was able to keep his wits about him and survive after suffering and witnessing such unspeakable horrors at the hands of such barbarians, and in the end his survival may well have hinged on the kindness of a Nazi Captain, Wilm Hosenfeld.<br /><br />The fact that a Nazi helped him live is too unbelievable to be fiction after all that Szpilman had witnessed and endured - it must be true, and this story is. The Pianist is a remarkable story that will be every bit as powerful hundreds of years from now. The Washington Post calls this book \\"historically indispensable,\\" and that is right on the mark. The book sits along side Anne Frank's tome as required Holocaust reading.<br /><br />Adding excerpts of Hosenfeld's diary at the end of the book makes this read all the more powerful. Hosenfeld's story is an amazing one, which reminded me of Oskar Schindler, since he, like Schindler, did much to save many Jews. Hosenfeld's diary entries in the back of the book add much to the story and torpedoes the assumption that every single Nazi had no heart and enjoyed the killings (although an overwhelming majority did, in this reviewer's opinion).<br /><br />This book is invaluable to Holocaust scholars and World War II students alike. And since I watched the movie before I read the book, I can attest that the movie was right on the mark in terms of accuracy. Very highly recommended reading.is invaluable to Holocaust scholars and World War II students alike.

US	49102643	R1BNDW9KRCOXGN	0316292613	656055457	Franklin D. Roosevelt: A Rendezvous with Destiny	Books	3	13	14	N	N	Not bad, but more "why" is needed	Frank Freidel has written a pretty good book about one of our most complex and admired presidents, but it certainly is not exhaustive. Freidel goes a good job explaining the who, what, where and when, but leaves out the all-important \\"why\\" in many of FDR's decisions. I would have loved to read more of FDR's thought processes and what went into his various decisions, especially at the all-important \\"Big 3\\" meetings at Tehran and Yalta. For instance, in David McCullough's Pulitzer-Prize winning tome, \\"Truman,\\" we get plenty of meat on Truman's thoughts during the Potsdam conference - words from his diaries, notes to subordinates, etc. McCullough gives readers dozens and dozens of pages on Truman's analysis and thought processes during the critical conference. In contrast, readers really don't get terrific, exhaustive details in Freidel's book, and it's a letdown. These details separate a good presidential biography from a great one.<br /><br />However, this is not a horrible book by any stretch. The author offers readers plenty about the 1932 election, FDR's disastrous decision to pack the Supreme Court, his thoughts and actions following Pearl Harbor, FDR's wartime strategy on the home front, his four presidential elections and even his death on April 12, 1945. Freidel covers the milestones of FDR's presidency well, but the devil is in the details. While I have not yet read Conrad Black's mammoth 1,200-page bio on FDR, one would hope it goes deeper than Freidel's 600-page tome. This book is recommended as a starter, or as part of a series of books to understand and study FDR.	2004-11-19

Lend Me Your Ears is very similar to a book of poetry - it is to be treasured, read and referenced over a lifetime; never to be \\"finished\\" or forgotten.<br /><br />This book has broad appeal - especially to fans of history and politics. But, anyone looking for inspiration or uplifting can find an appropriate speech or passage in its pages. And, most importantly, the book cuts both ways across the political divide - one can find speeches from John F. and Robert Kennedy, FDR, Clinton, Lincoln, Churchill, Martin Luther King, and least surprisingly, Nixon, since Safire served as one of his speechwriters. Safire knows the language as well as anyone, probably better than your favorite English teacher, and his marvelous talents as a speechwriter give this book even more credibility. A good speechwriter knows a great speech when he hears it and/or reads it, as Safire shows with his selections in this book. (Point of fact - I'm a proud, liberal Democrat, and I have these feelings about Safire!)<br /><br />Safire offers introductions and sage commentary before each speech, which I found both enlightening and entertaining. I cannot recommend this book highly enough for anyone interested in great speeches through history. I'm hoping for a revised edition or perhaps a volume II from Safire.<br /><br />One final note: some criticize the author for speeches omitted in this volume, but a line has to be drawn, or a book on this subject could span thousands of pages. Keep in mind, this book contains great speeches in Safire's opinion; it's not an end-all-be-all list of great historic speeches.	2004-11-19

I always look forward to Dowd's twice-weekly columns in the New York Times, and I'm seldom disappointed. \\"Bushworld: Enter at your own risk\\" is a collection of her columns on President Bush, going all the way back to the '99 Republican primaries. It's an informative, devastating and often tragically hilarious stroll down memory lane. Although I've previously read these columns, this is a welcome and treasured compilation of them regarding Bush's policies, decisions and contradictions all under one cover. It's a quick, fun, delightful, laugh-out-loud read.<br /><br />What sets Dowd apart from Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity and others on the right is that she doesn't demonize, she criticizes. For instance, she frequently takes Bush to task for his decision to invade Iraq, citing no evidence of a Saddam-Al-Queda tie, or the much-hyped weapons of mass destruction. If one of the right-wing commentators mentioned above were making a criticism about a liberal's view on Iraq, the conversation frequently begins with how that liberal \\"hates America\\" or \\"doesn't support the troops.\\" Dowd doesn't swim in such sewage. When she makes a criticism, she backs it up with facts, not innuendo and political rhetoric. The very best thing about Dowd is that she frequently uses her targets' quotes against them, not some fabricated lie or unsubstantiated rumor. She does her homework, and it shows. President Bush or Dick Cheney will deny having said something, and here comes Dowd in her next column with a stinging rebuke, with the quote and date it was said. She rarely misses.<br /><br />Buy this book and read it again. Regular readers of Dowd's NYT columns will love the book and the \\"refresher.\\" Highly recommended for readers wanting a crash course on Bush, from the '99 primaries through June '04.	2004-11-11

Being an American, I'm often exposed to the Western slant about what happened in the war, so this was quite refreshing. I have a natural inclination to question whatever I read - I don't just automatically believe anything. But, from what I have read, and I've done a fair amount of reading on the European theater, this book seems to confirm and expand on what is well documented - the German butchers' behavior was atrocious and indefensible when they invaded in the east (and wherever they conquered peoples and nations), and the Red Army doled out severe retribution when they conquered German territory. Two wrongs don't make a right, but war is ugly, brutal and deadly, and one can at least understand WITHOUT CONDONING the Red Army's actions. Most Red Army soldiers had lost comrades and were eager to settle the score.<br /><br />Beevor's writing gets bogged down at times, but in the middle of the book, when one can almost see the Red Army's brutal advance, the pace, quality and descriptions of the fighting gain fine form. The reader can almost sense the death, smell, brutality and desperation that defined Berlin in the spring of 1945. Beevor doesn't describe Berlin, he transports the reader there.<br /><br />This is a fine addition to any World War II library, and a great tome that describes the bitter closing days of the war in Europe.	2004-09-24

In \\"House of Bush, House of Saud,\\" Unger not only explores the very close relationship between the Bush I, II and Reagan administrations to the Saudi royal family, he blows the lid off many myths regarding the war on terrorism. Most notable among his startling revelations is how the United States government largely created two monsters that would later come back to haunt us in a big way - Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />In the 1980s, during the Iran/Iraq war, the U.S. alternated funding both sides with weapons. During that war, the Reagan administration, while having the public stance of \\"not negotiating with terrorists,\\" illegally sent 4,000 missiles to Iran, a violation of U.S. law, in order to free American hostages. Unger doesn't openly state it (he doesn't have to), but this is beyond contempt, considering Iran held 52 U.S. hostages from the U.S. embassy in Tehran for 444 days from 1979-1981. I'd certainly call that negotiating with terrorists. But with this, Unger is just getting started.<br /><br />Our government was equally kind to Iraq during the war, supplying it with chemical and biological weapons. The Reagan administration was aware that Saddam was gassing both his own people and Iranians during the war. Publicly, we condemned the attacks, but privately, we winked at Saddam and looked the other way. Ironically, President George W. Bush cited these Saddam atrocities as a reason for going to war against Iraq in 2003 - that Saddam had used poison gas and chemical weapons against his own people. The hitch - he wasn't doing it in 2003, he was doing it in the 1980s and early 90s. And those mass graves that we are now finding? Many are from the same era, and our government knew about this genocide while it was occurring. Hey, Saddam may have been a brutal dictator in the 1980s, but he was OUR dictator, and he had the added attraction of having lots and lots of oil.<br /><br />Unger also explores the rise of Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, and how our government LAVISHLY funded the Afghan rebels during the Soviet invasion - almost certainly the right decision. But, we sold so many weapons to the Afghan rebels, they were selling an unneeded surplus to other buyers. We oversupplied the rebels. The main problem with our Afghanistan strategy was that the U.S. experts didn't anticipate what would happen if the rebels were successful, which they ultimately were. When the Soviets finally left Afghanistan, Osama, born in Saudi Arabia, needed a new enemy to fight. He was now flush with cash and weapons to fight with, the latter courtesy of the U.S.A. The United States became his perfect target, when our forces arrived in Saudi Arabia in 1991 to fight the Gulf War against Saddam. Our existence in the Saudi kingdom was and is unforgivable in the eyes of bin Laden.<br /><br />The book also covers in detail what's advertised - the very close, personal relationship between the Bush family and the House of Saud, the ruling family of Saudi Arabia. Incredibly, the highest levels of our government allowed over 100 Saudi nationals, including many members of the bin Laden family, to leave the United States just days after the Sept. 11 attacks, when private flights were still prohibited and commercial flights were just resuming. Another Unger whopper - just months prior to 9-11, the U.S. embassy in Saudi Arabia rolled out a \\"Visa Express\\" program, where Saudis did not even need to appear in person to get a visa to the United States. Some of the 9-11 hijackers didn't even have to wait in line to get their U.S. visa. This program remained in effect even after 9-11!<br /><br />My main praise for the book - it not only explores the Bush family-House of Saud intimate relationship, as advertised, but it also offers the reader an in-depth look at the U.S. government's role in supplyingOsama bin Laden and Saddam before they became our sworn enemies. Other fascinating details covered, but that you'll have to get from the book and not here: the extensive PR campaign by the Kuwaiti government prior to the start of the '91 Gulf War to sway American public opinion; an extensive look at Prince Bandar, the Saudi ambassador to the U.S.; the bin Laden family history, its rise in Saudi Arabia, and the myth that the entire family has disowned Osama; how the Saudi government, despite very generous foreign aid, provided almost no assistance in helping to apprehend terrorists following attacks against U.S. citizens/soldiers in 1995, 1996 (Khobar towers) and the 2000 attack on the U.S.S. Cole; and the right-wing, conservative myth that President Clinton turned down Sudanese offers to turn over bin Laden to the United States.<br /><br />Anyone wishing to gain a valuable understanding into our enemies and wars we are waging today in the name of terror should definitely read this book. Unger has a terrific writing style that flows well and is easily understood - I read the book in one day; I simply couldn't put down this compelling read.

My expectations for Big Lies were met and surpassed. This book is a brilliant, quick read that rips the bark off of so many GOP misdeeds, it must be read twice to be both believed and absorbed. I could have read Big Lies in one evening, but I was so busy taking notes, it took me three.<br /><br />One of the best chapters in this book discusses John Ashcroft, our highly radical religious right attorney general, who frequently kneels down and is anoited with holy oil by his aging Pentecostal minister father, a ritual similar to the Old Testament kings of Israel. When he was about to be sworn in for the Senate in 1994, no holy oil was available, so his father used Crisco. As Conason says, Ashcroft is free to practice any religion he chooses, but why is the U.S. attorney general, a person who is sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States, imitating the behavior of ancient Hebrew kings? Perhaps, like our president, he believes he was chosen by God to lead our country. Scary stuff. During Ashcroft's confirmation hearings, a whopping 42 of his former Senate colleagues voted against his confirmation. 42!<br /><br />Conason goes on to blow the lid off of many Reagan myths perpetuated by the right, including his \\"fight\\" against terrorism, his deregulation of the Savings and Loan industry (which eventually cost taxpayers in excess of $1 trillion), and the many weapons that were sold to Iraq during the Iran/Iraq war on Reagan's watch. (These same weapons that Hussein possessed, obtained from the U.S., were frequently cited as an argument for going to war with Iraq in 2003 - that he had chemical and biological weapons and that he had gassed his own people. Inconvenient to that argument by the GOP is that a great deal of this happened on Reagan and Bush Sr's. watch and that we did NOTHING about it at the time.)<br /><br />Conason also details plenty of other misdeeds, a great deal of which can be effectively used against the GOP propaganda machine: 1. How Oliver North convinced Kuwait to release 17 Shi'ite terrorists (called the Dawa prisoners) in the late 1980s. The group responsible for the bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in 1983 demanded their release. Hence, the template was established that the U.S. DOES negotiate with terrorists, and if you hit us hard enough (ala Lebanon), we will leave. 2. How Clinton was obsessed with Osama bin Laden, and how, pre 9-11, several former Reagan officials praised Clinton for his anti-terrorism efforts. 3. The myth of the liberal media and how Bush received significantly more editorial endorsements than did Gore in 2000 (Conason cites a study by Editor & Publisher).<br /><br />These are just a few tidbits in a book that offers a stinging yet solid rebuke to people like Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity and all the rest. But in lieu of rhetoric, Conason offers facts with the documentation to back it up.<br /><br />One final note - as another reviewer for this book wrote, be warned - you will be outraged after reading this book. It doesn't offer the humor and laughs that Al Franken so effectively offers up in conjunction with facts in his bestseller, Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right. Big Lies is worth six stars - read it, be outraged, and vote your conscience.ush Sr's. watch and that we did NOTHING about it at the time.) <br /> <br />Conason also details plenty of other misdeeds, a great deal of which can be effectively used against the GOP propaganda machine: 1.

How Clinton was obsessed with Osama bin Laden, and how, pre 9-11, several former Reagan officials praised Clinton for his anti-terrorism efforts. 3. The myth of the liberal media and how Bush received significantly more editorial endorsements than did Gore in 2000 (Conason cites a study by Editor & Publisher). <br /> <br />These are just a few tidbits in a book that offers a stinging yet solid rebuke to people like Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity and all the rest. But in lieu of rhetoric, Conason offers facts with the documentation to back it up. <br /> <br />One final note - as another reviewer for this book wrote, be warned - you will be outraged after reading this book. It doesn't offer the humor and laughs that Al Franken so effectively offers up in conjunction with facts in his bestseller, Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right. Big Lies is worth six stars - read it, be outraged, and vote your conscience.	2004-08-20
US	49102643	R3GPU134TICZYN	1586630830	38714851	Nam: A Photographic History	Books	4	9	10	N	N	A great photo compilation; good 'Nam encyclopedia	This is a wonderful Vietnam encyclopedia that is well worth the price and the considerable space it takes up on your bookshelf. The pictures alone make a significant contribution to the study and understanding of Vietnam.<br /><br />The book is categorized nicely by year, so the reader can pick a year and jump right in. The text is somewhat stilted and abbreviated at times - how can Richard Nixon be adequately explained on one page of large text? But to a reader new to Vietnam study, this book is a nice start.<br /><br />One more word about the pictures - it's interesting to note that two of the most famous pictures of the war are absent from this text. The first one, of a naked girl running down a road, burned, after an errant U.S. napalm strike; and the second one of a helicopter on the top of a roof near the U.S. embassy shortly before the fall of Saigon, certainly belong in any book that professes to be a photographic history of Vietnam. Also missing is a Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph of a woman running to greet a returning POW after he steps off a plane. Perhaps these absences are a matter of copyright permission? But, this is a minor complaint, really. This text brings together so many startling and educational pictures about the war, it more than makes up for the absence of a few famous pictures.<br /><br />One additional point about the text - it's interesting to note the political bent the authors allow to creep into the text (intentionally?). On the topic of draft dodgers, the authors take several shots at President Clinton. In one instance, Daugherty and Mattson bring up a right-wing bumper sticker from 1992: \\"What's the difference between Jane Fonda and Clinton? Fonda went to Vietnam.\\" In another instance the authors state as fact how Clinton tried to have incriminating documents of his \\"draft dodging\\" destroyed during the '92 election. (They offer no proof, but state it as fact.) I guess it's because this is a political year that I even noticed it, but readers could do without this kind of stuff. I wonder why the authors didn't offer any jibes at George W. Bush for having signed up for the National Guard, getting to skip over hundreds of people because of his surname, in order to avoid service in Vietnam? My point is not to defend \\"Hanoi Jane\\" for her despicable actions or for Clinton's having dodged the draft, but that there are plenty of people, millions in fact, of all political persuasions who dodged the draft to avoid going to Vietnam. This kind of debate should be presented in a non-partisan manner in a book like this, or not at all.<br /><br />However, this is a great book worthy of space on any history enthusiast's bookshelf, and I'm happy to own it.ticed it, but readers could do without this kind of stuff.

The late Ambrose, who many considered to be one of America's best WW II historians, doesn't disappoint. The book offers up plenty of details and statistics that history scholars love, such as the 175,000 troops, nearly 11,000 airplanes and 5,333 ships used during D-Day - history's largest amphibious landing.<br /><br />Ambrose also writes about the ME-262, the Volksdeutsche, Midge Gillars, Cherokee Code Talkers, and so much more. This book is a terrific start for a WW II beginner, and it offers plenty of facts and interesting information for historians not new to European Theater study.<br /><br />The author was not particularly known for gripping prose, and this book is further confirmation of that. Some passages alternate between very causal prose, almost conversational, and then Ambrose will throw in a \\"sine qua non.\\" When he does the latter, it almost appears as if he's showing off, but that's his style, and almost all the time, it's highly effective.<br /><br />On balance, this is a must read for any enthusiast of WW II, and if you traditionally enjoy Ambrose books (as I do), this book is essential.	2004-08-19

Whether you love her or hate her (put me in the former group), the Clintons always make for good reading.<br /><br />This was a very good read, even though I feel there were a few sections of self pitying. But, to be honest, I find this perfectly acceptable considering the despicable attacks that the first family had to endure for eight years. She mostly leaves out her feelings about the whole Lewinsky affair, but why should she air those? I happen to feel that it's pretty obvious how she felt about the affair - her husband cheated on her, so why state the obvious? Besides that, if you are looking for some deep feelings about the affair, read \\"My Life,\\" President Clinton's book, where he writes candidly about his failings and why he had the affair in the first place.<br /><br />She did leave a few details a bit thin that I would have liked to have - I could have used a couple of hundred more pages. After all, the Clintons did spend eight years in the White House, and she has very strong opinions on important issues, clearly evidenced by her being the only first lady to serve in the Senate. More of her thoughts on policy during the Clintons' tenure in the White House would have been nice. The book's brevity is what prevents this book from getting five stars.	2004-07-28
US	49102643	RQJ5TQ13TTBQM	074325547X	828250107	Plan of Attack	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Terrific reporting, great insight, good narrative	This is merely a good-but-not-great narrative, which is very surprising, considering the traditional quality of Woodward's tomes. Plan of Attack didn't prove to be an overly gripping story told with fascinating prose, but it is still a pretty good read, offering some critical insights into the run up to the war in Iraq.<br /><br />It is quite astonishing that Woodward was allowed such access not only to important, key players in the Bush administration, but also to President Bush himself, considering the president knew that Woodward was interviewing him for a book, and that the administration would have no control over its content. That's shocking, considering this administration's penchant for strict information control and secrecy.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, there are some pretty damning quotes from the president and other administration members about the lead up to the war, the lack of WMD and most importantly to this reader, the deception involved in planning the war. It's quite obvious that Bush, Tommy Franks, Rumsfeld and others were dishonest with the public and press about the administration's intentions leading up to the war, as Woodward points out on several occasions in the book. This is most obvious when at one point in the book, Woodward writes of Ari Fleischer telling the White House press corps that the president HAS NO PLANS FOR WAR ON HIS DESK when the planning for war had been under way for many, many months at that point.<br /><br />This book is not just simply a slam on the administration, but on balance, it doesn't paint an altogether flattering picture of Bush's War Cabinet and its bent for war. This is hammered home by quotes from Powell, his deputy Richard Armitage and even some quotes from Bush himself, given to Woodward during interviews for Plan of Attack. However, there are plenty of things in the book that many Bush supporters will point to in order to find justification for the Iraq war.<br /><br />Whatever your political perspective, this is a valuable addition to the debate of the merits of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

This is a presidential memoir that lives up to the hype, plain and simple. Anyone expecting and hoping for a candid and exhaustive analysis of his successes and failures as president will not be disappointed. However, if you are hoping for the president to take swipes at former enemies, forget it. Clinton takes the high road - about as close as he gets is when he describes Newt Gingrich as entertaining when he gets all worked up into a frenzy. For this, Clinton deserves plenty of credit - he certainly has many reasons to take a run at plenty of people on the right. In rare instances in the book where he does take some shots, such as his words about Kenneth Starr, he does it with tact, class and dignity.<br /><br />Some people have complained about the length of the book - I'm not one of them. Clinton does spend approximately 300 pages detailing his early life, but he obviously found it necessary to describe those years in detail to best understand him, and I'm happy he wrote the book that way.<br /><br />The first half of the book - his early years and his years as governor of Arkansas, were refreshing and informative - these are the years most of us typically don't hear about now - the press focuses on his presidency. But, these years shaped the man and his presidency. However, the second half of the book - his presidential years, is written a little too much like a diary. But, it's a minor complaint - Clinton still brings readers the details about his presidency that I expect most would want to read about.<br /><br />One other minor complaint - the president doesn't offer many thoughts about the many players in his administration. For instance, Sidney Blumenthal wrote a definitive account of his experiences on Clinton's team during his second term; George Stephanopoulos wrote a not-altogether-flattering tome of his experiences during the '92 election and his time with Clinton during his first term, etc. We get virtually nothing about Blumenthal and a mere paragraph about Stephanopoulos's departure. Dee Dee Myers, the first female White House Press Secretary in history, is given a paragraph or two. Madeline Albright, the first female secretary of state, isn't written about much, nor is Janet Reno. Certainly Clinton should have had more to say about these people, especially Stephanopoulos and Blumenthal, since they had so much to say about him.<br /><br />Most importantly, Clinton writes at length about the impeachment proceedings, and his indiscretions with Monica Lewinsky. Those words must have been painful to write, but he did, and he deserves credit for being so candid and forthright.<br /><br />As big of a fan as I am of Clinton, I didn't hang on his every word and believe everything he wrote. For example, he writes that he was always a big supporter of NASA and the shuttle program. No, he wasn't, and his budgets toward NASA bear this out. He also writes that the Supreme Court decision in the Paula Jones case, for her lawsuit to go forward during his presidency, was one of its worst decisions in years. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about that (especially in light of the Bush v. Gore case in 2000, which is among the worst SC decisions in HISTORY), but a president is not above the law. Even though her case was ridiculous and baseless and funded by the GOP-backed Rutherford Institute, the Supreme Court was probably correct in allowing the lawsuit to go forward. The law played itself out and the right thing happened - the case was thrown out of court as groundless and without merit.<br /><br />Whether you were are fan of Clinton or just want to read about his perspective during his years in office, I recommend this book highly. Some criticize him as trying to defend his legacy, but what presidential memoir DOESN'T try to do that?get virtually nothing about Blumenthal and a mere paragraph about Stephanopoulos's departure.

Johnson and His Times, 1961-1973	Books	5	5	6	N	N	A terrific, complete account of LBJ's presidency	This book is a very good account of LBJ's formidable years, from his ascendancy to the vice presidency in 1960 (a position which he hated) to his swearing in aboard Air Force One hours after JFK's assassination through the end of his administration and subsequent death in 1973. However, it would have been nice to have more on LBJ's years as vice president in this book, particularly because LBJ hated being second fiddle so much.<br /><br />However, Dallek, a superb historian, doesn't disappoint in \\"Flawed Giant,\\" where he offers up plenty of details about Johnson's personal torture that was Vietnam, and also LBJ's personal passions - civil rights and his beloved Great Society. Dallek does a good job of describing what could aptly be termed the 2 LBJs - the indecisive one whose foreign policy decisions were often disastrous, including the Dominican Republic, Vietnam and North Korea; and the truly compassionate one who cared about people of color and those less fortunate with his Great Society and civil rights legislative successes.<br /><br />I have to confess to not reading \\"Lone Star Rising,\\" Dallek's part one on LBJ's life. I wanted to skip to LBJ's presidential years, but based on Dallek's reputation and another work of his which I have read \\"The Unfinished Presidency, John F. Kennedy,\\" Dallek's fantastic book on JFK, I would recommend \\"Lone Star Rising\\" in a second.<br /><br />It's important to note that Dallek isn't an LBJ cheerleader - he writes equal parts good and bad about a man not easily understood or described. Until Robert Caro finishes his fourth installment on LBJ (part 4 is on LBJ's presidency), \\"Flawed Giant\\" is probably one of the best accounts on the Johnson presidency. Also worth a look: Dallek's one-volume account on LBJ's life from start to finish, \\"Lyndon B. Johnson: Portrait of a President.\\" However, one-volume accounts of a president tend to skim too much and offer too little detail, such as Ambrose's \\"Eisenhower: Soldier and President.\\"nt.\\"	2004-07-28

Richard Clarke has shown a great deal of courage to come out with a book in an election year that is critical of our incumbent president. Yet none of this deterred Clarke from not only showing courage, but also giving W. a body slam from the top turnbuckle for his reaction to the 9/11 al Qaeda attacks by attacking... Iraq.<br />Clarke's bipartisan credentials are as good as anyone's in Washington, having worked for Reagan, Bush Sr., Clinton and W. Yet, he has plenty of venom for Reagan, Bush Sr. and for W. Clarke also swipes at W. for shortchanging homeland security (post 9-11) and also for not giving terrorism near the level of priority (pre-9-11) it was given under the Clinton administration.<br />Clarke isn't a total Clinton cheerleader, but he does make the point that can now be seen in hindsight - that President Clinton did more to combat terrorism than any other president. Clarke rightly makes the point that because of Clinton's other scandals, he was pretty much in a no-win situation no matter what he did to combat terrorism.<br />It's easy for some, especially Clinton critics, to offer Monday-Morning-Quarterback analysis of how Clinton didn't do enough to fight terrorism, but post-9/11 it's virtually impossible to recreate the fixation the public had in the 90s with \\"important\\" things other than terrorism - Monica, Gary Condit and Survivor.<br />To some, this book appears to be a partisan slam on the president in an election year. But to any honest reader with an open mind, it's an eye opener about the real truth behind America's war on terrorism. Highly recommended.	2004-06-18

Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Great account by the one genius in this administration	This book is an amazing, insider account of the secretive Bush administration by an inside player through the first 23 months of Dubya's presidency. Quite frankly, every voter, no matter what his or her political affiliation, should read this book to gain a better insight into Bush's intellect and the inner workings of his presidency.<br />To begin with, it's amazing that Paul O'Neill, a self-made millionaire who transformed Alcoa into a global heavyweight, would even accept the position as treasury secretary in the first place. He even tried to talk Bush and Cheney out of their offer, but once he accepted it, his quickly became disillusioned on a number of issues, including global warming, the administration's irresponsible stance on reckless tax cuts, a lack of leadership on cracking down on corporate CEOs and, last but not least, Iraq.<br />It's truly amusing that the Republican attack machine is going after O'Neill much like Richard Clarke. But, what cannot be explained about both men is that if they were so bad and awful as is now being portrayed, why did they both survive in this administration for so long? It's a question not easily or adequately answered. One possibility is that both men, bright and smart with more governmental experience than Bush when he \\"won\\" the presidency, have valid points to make about the ineptness of this administration.<br />The most troubling allegation by O'Neill is how Bush, almost immediately after taking office, began planning the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. This blows right out of the water all of the president's assertions to be \\"fighting the war on terror\\" by getting rid of Saddam, especially when these facts are viewed through a post-9/11 looking glass. Bush likes to subtly tie in Iraq with terrorism against the U.S. and even 9/11, but the facts just aren't there. (For more on the many myths surrounding the war in Iraq, I highly recommend Richard Clarke's book.)<br />This book is a fascinating, quick, educational read about the inner workings of Dubya's presidency.

The book covers the time period from Angelo Bruno's murder on March 21, 1980 through the present, with some background on Bruno as well.<br />The man most responsible for the downfall of Philadelphia mob bosses Joseph \\"Skinny Joey\\" Merlino, Ralph Natale and John Stanfa was Ron Previte, a gangster-turned-FBI informant who managed to capture all of the above on devastating FBI surveillance tapes by wearing a wire while putting his life at risk every day. The book centers mostly around Previte, and it's a good choice - he's interesting to read about and he certainly was/is a colorful character.<br />Many probably believe that Previte is a \\"rat,\\" or the ultimate turncoat on his Mafia \\"friends.\\" Part of me agrees - he disobeyed a trust, even if it was based on criminal activities. That trust was also based on friendship, BUT the main point is that Previte was only loyal to himself, not those around him. After reading the book, it's also true that Previte did Philadelphia and society a favor by playing an integral role in putting 21 mobsters behind bars.<br />As someone who has read a great deal about the five Mafia families in New York, I was mostly unfamiliar with the Philadelphia branch of La Cosa Nostra. Anastasia brings dead and alive Philly mobsters to life in a well-written, fast-reading book. The author clearly knows this subject well and it shows in his writing. This book is a must for people who enjoy Mafia tomes. I also highly recommend \\"Underboss,\\" written by Peter Maas with Sammy Gravano.	2004-04-15

I don't automatically read something and believe it 100 percent, but if Conason and Lyons have documented HALF of their research and interviews accurately (and based on their reputations, I'd believe it's significantly higher than that), many, many Republicans have a great deal to apologize for.<br />Conason and Lyons perform a devastating autopsy on the right's campaign to destroy Clinton before he even announced his candidacy for president in 1991, through both terms of his presidency. As someone who voted for Clinton twice (and would happily do so again), I knew Clinton had enemies, but I didn't know he had this many who were this menacing.<br />The authors lay out in stunning detail the lies and half truths that were willingly perpetrated by the mainstream media, discussing topics like the Foster suicide (many were convinced/hoping that it was a Clinton-sponsored murder), Troopergate, Filegate, Ken Starr and the wanton abuse of his Independent Council powers and much, much more. The above topics have been discussed ad nauseum in other books and articles, but the authors go further, detailing the many right-wing backed publications such as The American Spectator, the wealthy right wing tycoon Richard Mellon Scaife and his backing of the Arkansas Project, William Renquist and his role in Whitewater and the Starr appointment, and most importantly in this reader's eyes, how the first independent council, Robert Fiske, was ousted after he couldn't find any wrongdoing on the part of the Clintons. This paved the way for Starr's appointment, who would stop at nothing to get something on the Clintons.<br />Conason and Lyons also detail the highly unethical treatment of Monica Lewinsky at the hands of Starr and his deputies. Speaking of Monica, the authors gain credibility by not condoning or even trying to explain away Clinton's moral lapses with Monica and other women, but they also detail the credibility problems of many Clinton accusers, namely Gennifer Flowers, Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones.<br />This book simply must be read to be believed. The authors certainly got my partisan blood boiling all over again, 90s style, about what the Republicans did to try to bring down a good but imperfect man. This book makes one wonder where the \\"liberal media\\" was during the 1990s, when even the most incredibly idiotic rumors about Clinton, after being reported in a publication of ill repute, would be picked up by the mainstream media. The authors rightly conclude that publications like The Washington Post and the New York Times (the latter of which broke Whitewater and was perhaps eager to make up for getting scooped during Watergate) had too much invested in Whitewater as time went on for the stories to come up empty. Hence, the papers kept after a story that never was really there in the first place. Even more outrageous, during critical junctures during Starr's investigation, when information came to light that proved highly favorable to the Clintons, it went largely unreported by two of America's most &quot;reputable&quot; newspapers.<br />My one minor complaint about the book is that it did not detail the impeachment proceedings at all, and the impeachment and the GOP's behavior during that show trial is every bit as outrageous as what led up to it. Had Conason and Lyons written the full story about the impeachment, this could be THE ultimate book from A to Z about the GOP's war on the Clintons. (Perhaps we'll see a part II?)

The movie is a classic and a favorite among journalism students (this one included), but I'd recommend a combination of watching the movie and definitely reading the book. A quick compliment to the authors - the \\"Cast of Characters\\" section in the beginning of the book really helps the reader along, since there are so many names to keep straight.<br />This book harkens back to a time when work, time and careful documentation and cultivation of sources were required before printing bombshell accusations against an administration, unlike the scandal-mongering atmosphere from the Clinton administration up through the present. With the advent of the Internet and 24-hour cable news networks, the trend now is to publish or air rumor, innuendo or unfounded stories and do the legwork later, if at all. Woodward and Bernstein didn't do it that way - they uncovered a scandal the old fashioned way - they did legwork to ensure the accuracy of their stories. The result of their hard work and diligence is this book - the biggest, most sensational and shocking political story in the history of our country. Anyone wanting to know the inside story of Richard Nixon's fall from power, start here, and also read Bernstein and Woodward's \\"The Final Days.\\" This book is a classic that will remain so 100 years from now.	2004-04-05

I had very high expectations for this book, and with a few exceptions, I was mostly disappointed. I probably made the mistake of reading Sidney Blumenthal's \\"The Clinton Wars\\" before I read this book. Blumenthal's tome is probably the best political book I have ever read - it's an excellent account and insider's view into President Clinton's second term, and his psyche.<br />By contrast, this is an account of Clinton's first term that offers insights into the '92 election, Clinton's first four years, and the administration's early battles on gays in the military, the assault weapons ban, NAFTA, etc. My two chief criticisms of this book: 1. It describes none of these events thoroughly, and 2. It does not offer nearly enough perspective of President Clinton's thoughts and motives.<br />Stephanopoulos seems to have written this book to stroke his ego - the writing seems very hurried. But hurried for what? This is just a guess, but perhaps Stephanopoulos wanted to rush this book out to press before his name was forgotten and Clinton was out of office? (The hard cover has a copyright of 1999.) Too often in this book, we get way too much George and not enough Bill. Let's face it - probably the majority of people who buy this book are doing so to gain insight into the Clinton presidency, not Stephanopoulos' career. The author also has an annoying habit of giving us his insecure thoughts and fears in italics during important events, arguments or crises. That's the mark of an immature writer.<br />There are many examples throughout the book where a very important incident or at least one of memorable importance is merely glossed over, but I'll just offer one brief one here. During the '92 election, when the Clintons went on 60 Minutes in light of the Gennifer Flowers allegations, a memorable thing happened off camera that was later revealed in the media and aired on television. During the interview, a bank of klieg lights fell down, nearly hitting the Clintons. Without missing a beat, both Hillary and Bill proceeded with the memorable interview (when at one point, Hillary made the infamous \\"stand by your man\\" comment, of Tammy Wynette fame). Yet, Stephanopoulos had no comment on the lights falling, Clinton's composure, or Hillary's controversial comment, and according to him, he was IN THE ROOM during the interview! It would have been nice for the author to \\"put us in the room,\\" in the middle of the action, and to give the reader his thoughts and those of the Clintons.<br />To be fair, the book has some bright spots, too. Stephanopoulos gives readers some very good insight about the two government shutdowns during Clinton's showdown with the GOP Congress and Newt Gingrich. Clinton's budget battles and his reasoning behind his economic views are covered quite nicely. He also covers many other domestic issues well, which gives readers good insight into Clinton's goals and dreams during the early years of his presidency.<br />For diehards wanting another look inside the Clinton presidency, I recommend the book. But, if you're looking for highly detailed, insightful accounts of Clinton's thoughts and actions during the '92 election and his first term, and not his feelings and actions toward George Stephanopoulos, I recommend looking elsewhere, like when Clinton releases his memoirs, and also Sidney Blumenthal's aforementioned book, \\"The Clinton Wars.\\"sing a beat, both Hillary and Bill proceeded with the memorable interview (when at one point, Hillary made the infamous \\"stand by your man\\" comment, of Tammy Wynette fame).

I bought this book for my photography class at Temple University, and it will happily be on my bookshelf and referenced for a long time (or perhaps until the 8th or 9th edition)?<br />The book contains many useful lessons for beginners, if that is your level, for basic photography. I would have liked for there to be more about digital photography though, but I'm sure that will come in later editions as that medium evolves. There is also plenty to offer a budding photographer about lessons in the darkroom, and that was very useful and continues to be.<br />This is the ultimate photography book that will more than get a beginner started, or be a big help as a refresher to an amateur. However, the price is a tremendous drawback - it's a lot of bang, but for the bucks you pay, I'd try getting a used copy - there are many great dealers on Amazon that can help. This book is well worth owning though. It misses the 5-star mark because of cost.	2004-04-04

The most dramatic thought that I came away with after reading \\"Underboss\\" is that Sammy the Bull didn't bring down Gotti and the Gambinos - Gotti did that. Sammy just put the final nail in the coffin.<br />Gotti's arrogant, publicity seeking ways were ultimately what brought down the Gambino family. Had Gotti been a little more humble and knew the art of \\"laying low\\" after several acquittals, he very well may never have been convicted, or at least he would have been out of jail and in power much longer. AND, had he not stabbed Gravano in the back, as Sammy heard on the tapes in a courtroom, Sammy may never have testified against Gotti in the first place.<br />But, the truth is, Sammy is no model citizen, as he readily attests to in the book. He kills his brother-in-law and performs a number of other murders for seemingly minor Mafia indiscretions. To his credit, though, he doesn't pretend portray himself as a victim, either. Since he's currently doing a 20-year stretch for running an E ring, that's poetic justice in the eyes of the many he betrayed to avoid prison for his underworld doings. Sammy's lived quite a life, and this book let's the curious in on the action. It's probably one of the best Mafia books I've ever read. Highly recommended.	2004-04-04

This book is exactly what you'd expect by Mr. Moore - an anti-Bush, liberal-championing tome by an unapologetic activist. That's mostly what I expected and why I bought the book in the first place, and I wasn't disappointed. However, Moore is sometimes just a little too raw for me (and I'm a very left liberal) when criticizing the president, and that takes away from his credibility, a little.<br />However, perhaps Moore is what liberals have been lacking for a long time - a strong fighter that isn't scared off by the right's attack tactics. To that point, Moore succeeds brilliantly, exposing the Bush family's strong ties to Saudi Arabia's royal family and also the bin Ladens. It almost looks too impossible to believe, but the first chapter on the Bush family's ties to the Saudis is so extensively footnoted (and by reputable sources), it's going to be awfully hard if not impossible for the right to debunk Moore's accusations and assertions. One area that Moore discusses at length - the fact that many Saudis and members of bin Laden's family took off for France the day after 9/11, when all flights were grounded! Why did our government allow it? Moore wants to know, and shouldn't we all?!? Moore lambastes that decision and many others by the president during and following 9/11. As you would expect, Iraq takes center stage.<br />The middle of the book has a Jesus chapter that I didn't find amusing at all - if you're going to blast the radical religious right, do it without blaspheming Jesus and the Bible. The Christian fundamentalists make an easy enough target without resorting to such tactics.<br />However, after that, Moore makes a comeback with a \\"call to arms\\" to all liberals for the upcoming election. He even goes so far as to say that he's going to donate the amount of his unnecessary Bush tax cut (he's in an upper income bracket) toward defeating the president, and he's even got a Web site where readers can e-mail suggestions about where to send money from his cut. Bravo, Moore!<br />If you want the real story behind many of Bush's flubs, but you want it with the \\"bark off,\\" look no further than this book. I'd rate it right below Al Franken's book, \\"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right.\\" The cover photo is brilliant, and it serves as proper foreshadowing for the book's contents. I think of Moore as the left's Ann Coulter; he doesn't have the legs, but he has what Ann never will - credibility and honesty.s cut.

I was only 9 years old when the accident happened, but not long thereafter I bought this book during its first printing. Adding to my fascination to the accident is the fact that I was born and raised in Pennsylvania, and my father was a long-time employee of Met-Ed. My interest in nuclear plants is alive and well, since I now live within 5 miles of one of the largest nuclear plants (in Megawatt producing power) in the United States.<br />I read it at least 5 times because I found it so fascinating and I loved the characters that Rosen and Gray bring to life, such as plant superintendent Gary Miller and control room operator Bill Zewe. The technical details are explained in easy-to-understand language that makes reading the book a pleasure, not a pain.<br />I plan on buying this book again to reread it, as my original copy is long lost. But, I enjoyed it the first 5 times I read it, and I'm buying another copy.<br />If you want a great overall perspective on the America's &quot;Near-Chernobyl,&quot; pick up a copy and enjoy.	2004-01-29

Masterfully researched and documented, Yelton's book reads a bit like a long academic paper, which stands to reason, as I believe the book owes its origins to Yelton's dissertation.<br /><br />As the forward states, there is no one place or location that contains a significant cache of Volkssturm documents in Germany, so the author spent a great deal of time, energy and money to produce this work. It shows in the reading. Unlike many accounts of the Third Reich, most of which usually gloss over the Volkssturm, this is a critical look at the milita's origins, reasons for forming, the fight among Nazi leaders to lead the militia and its performance in battle.<br /><br />A few tidbits that made for wonderful, surprising reading:<br />1. The Volkssturm \\"People Storm\\" was controlled by the Nazi Party, not the Wermacht. The reasons for this are many, but it largely contributed to the milita's mostly poor performance on the battlefield, with notable exceptions (also discussed in the book).<br /><br />2. Nazi leaders were fearful that Volkssturm members were going to be treated as partisans if caught by Allies and subsequently shot. Shockingly to this reader, the Nazis actually initiated contact with the British and Americans prior to the milita's formation to inquire how Volkssturm members would be treated if captured. Getting a positive response from Allied leadership that the unit would be treated as a legal militia (again, to my astonishment), the Nazis proceeded to form the Volkssturm. One can't help but wonder if the Allies had denied the Volkssturm \\"militia status\\" if the war would have been shortened on the Western Front, resulting in fewer Allied deaths.<br /><br />The middle of the book is a bit of a dry read, as Yelton gets bogged down in a buffet of statistics. But, sticking with the book has its rewards, as Yelton discusses at length the militia's performance in battle toward the end of the war.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to any student of WW II who would like to know more about the Volkssturm, its origins and performance in battle. \\"Hitler's Volkssturm\\" makes a welcome addition to any World War II bookshelf.elton discusses at length the militia's performance in battle toward the end of the war.<BR> <BR>I would highly recommend this book to any student of WW II who would like to know more about the Volkssturm, its origins and performance in battle. \\"Hitler's Volkssturm\\" makes a welcome addition to any World War II bookshelf.	2004-01-27

Two central comments about the book:<br />1. Aiken gives short shrift for what readers are probably thirsting for: the time leading up to resignation and Nixon's resignation itself. There aren't nearly enough pages about this in an otherwise good effort by Aiken.<br />2. The book did not strike me as tremendously biased, and perhaps this is because Aiken is not an American, but British, so perhaps he doesn't have the passion and partisanship that colors many books on our most enigmatic of presidents.<br />For an excellent, in-depth account of Nixon's final two years in the White House, I would highly recommend Richard Reeves' &quot;Richard Nixon: Alone in the White House.&quot; (I have reviewed that book as well.)<br />Aiken's account is a good overall read on Nixon, but it is by no means exhaustive. I'd recommend it as a good inclusion on a list of books to gain a good overall perspective on Nixon.	2004-01-27

Kennedy, 1917-1963	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A true masterpiece	Dallek has written a little over 700 pages of fascinating insight into the Kennedy presidency. It's important to note that Dallek has not written a &quot;pro-Kennedy&quot; book at all - he deals with JFK's affairs head on, as well as the incredible amount of medication that the president took not only to keep him alive, but to ameliorate his pain from back injuries, spastic colitis, Addison's Disease and other physical ailments.<br />Particularly interesting in this masterful tome is Dallek's detailed writing on Vietnam, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Bay of Pigs Invasion and JFK's marital infidelities. Where Dallek breaks new ground is his examination of JFK's medical records, and how JFK's extensive use of medication affected his life and also his decision making during his presidency. Dallek concludes, based on his seemingly thorough research, that the president's medication did not influence any important decision making. But, this is an issue that bears discussion and scholarly debate. Dallek's conclusions carry significant weight because JFK's medical records until recently were not made available to authors and scholars.<br />This book will probably hold up as one of the best JFK biographies ever for many reasons - the best being its largely objective view based on the author's thorough research and interviews.<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone even remotely interested in learning about JFK the man and his presidency.	2004-01-27

I've always been a big fan of Walter Cronkite (I even got to meet and interview him while I was in college), but I wasn't sure what to expect from this book. I was not disappointed. Cronkite takes the reader through his start in journalism and through all of the important events that he reported on while serving as managing editor of the CBS Evening News. He does jump around a little bit, but that is a very, very minor complaint.<br />What I like most about the book is that Cronkite is honestly and genuinely modest. If there ever was a news man that would have cause to brag and take stock in his accomplishments in a high-handed manner, it's Cronkite, but he does not at all. Uncle Walter writes his book like he conducted his broadcasts - he just tells it like it is. This is a wonderful book not only for newshounds and journalism aficionados, but also for anyone who would like to read about a figure of Americana. Highly recommended.	2004-01-27

It isn't bad - it explored all of the Kennedy men adequately but none very extensively. Leamer does do a great job of explaining the relationships among the Kennedy men, especially the complicated relationship that Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. had with all of his children.<br />The author offers up stunning and excruciating details about Joe Kennedy Jr's. death, as well as Kathleen's death. These instances were painful to read, but very insightful about the patriarch's emotions.<br />I feel Leamer did concentrate a bit too much on JFK's sexual trysts, but that is a topic that no book on the Kennedys will neglect, so it's not really a complaint.<br />It would have been nice had the book ended in 1968 and not 1963. Another 100 pages would have given the reader much more great reading on RFK following the president's death and also his run for the presidency in 1968.<br />All in all, this is a good book for diehard Kennedy aficionados.	2004-01-13

Sidney has written an 800-page masterpiece about the Clinton presidency that made me outraged all over again about the GOP's wanton abuse of power during the Clinton years - specifically during Clinton's second term, when Blumenthal served as the president's chief political advisor.<br />To say that the president was morally bankrupt regarding his affairs is to state the obvious, and Blumenthal doesn't try to defend the president. What he does do is point out the blatant hypocrisy of the GOP leadership and Kenneth W. Starr, chief Clinton hater and possibly the most inept special prosecutor this country has ever seen (one can't help come to this conclusion after reading of Starr's abuses outlined in the book).<br />Blumenthal also details: Matt Drudge's libel about Blumenthal's relationship with his wife that resulted in a lawsuit, Paula Jones's right wing backers who encouraged her to move forward with her baseless lawsuit (that was later thrown out of court), the myth of the birthmark on the president's genitals, the press's distortions of Al Gore during the stolen campaign in 2000, the right wing scourge named Richard Mellon Scaife, the outright lies cooked up by GOP hacks to discredit William Jefferson Clinton that started before he ever took the oath of office, and the myth of Clinton ignoring the threats of terrorism in the 1990s.<br />The latter point is a pretty stark one in the wake of 9-11, since President Bush has suffered no political price for the disasters happening on his watch. Clinton ordered the bombing of Osama Bin Laden and just missed him by hours in August of 1998 following the attacks on U.S. embassies in Africa, all while Starr was busy subpoenaing the president to testify before a grand jury about his sex life (these 2 events happened within one week of each other). There is plenty of blame to go around for 9-11, but to blame it all on President Clinton is a line fit for Comedy Central. If the president was too busy to combat terrorism, as is often the accusation, then Congress and the FBI were pretty busy with less important things as well, since Starr's investigation WAS USING UP TO 78 FBI AGENTS. That's a whole lot of manpower not looking into terrorism, but this comes as no surprise since FBI Director Louis Freeh is an unabashed Clinton hater, as is Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist. The latter hating Clinton so much probably didn't have anything to do with the 5-4 vote deciding the 2000 election, did it?<br />Blumenthal also lays waste to the myth that is Rush Limbaugh, where Rush gets all of his information (directly from the RNC), and his incredible intolerance, myopia and attacks on the Clintons, including Chelsea, whom he once referred to as \\"the White House dog.\\" It took him nearly a decade to apologize.<br />This is just a smattering of what will endure as probably the best book on the Clinton presidency by someone not named Clinton.ine fit for Comedy Central.

Nixon haters will love this book - Nixon supporters won't be happy and probably won't want to read it. People curious about Richard Nixon the man should certainly want to take a peek under the cover.<br />I really liked this book. The central premise is that Nixon cut himself off from the most of his administration and the rest of the world during the darkest hours of his presidency. It was shocking to read how many important foreign policy decisions that Nixon and Kissinger made together, many possibly illegally.<br />For those wishing to explore the dark side of Nixon, there's plenty to read about, including anti-Semitic, racist and misogynist comments about Indira Gandhi, his misuse of government funds and power and his illegal campaign contributions. The conviction records of his former aides and the tapes do not lie - Nixon was far from our best chief executive in many ways, and Reeves lays a good part of this out in stunning detail.<br />This book makes a great addition to any historian's library.	2004-01-12

He further offers up in stunning detail Israel's deliberate attack on the U.S.S. Liberty during the 1967 Israeli conflict with Egypt and the capture of the U.S.S. Pueblo by North Korea in early 1968 and President Johnson's maddening inaction.<br />The author also lays out specifics of the agency in such detail that I sometimes asked myself, &quot;Should he really be writing this stuff? Shouldn't this be still secret/classified?&quot; He obviously had some great access to write this important book.<br />I was a little surprised at Bamford's occasional liberal slant on events, specifically his criticism of President Bush regarding the 9-11 terrorist attacks. As a liberal myself, I wasn't offended, just surprised to read it here. (I was also outraged all over again at Bush's behavior on the morning and afternoon of 9/11/01.)<br />He also does a nice job of telling how the NSA slipped in the 1990s in keeping up with rapidly emerging technology. He also wrote very insightfully about what the NSA is doing in the future to catch up.<br />The only significant thing that disappointed me about the book was the lack of discussion about important events in the 1980s and 1990s. It's almost as if he got to the end of the 70s and said, &quot;That's good enough.&quot; Since the book was published in 2001, I would have expected a lot more. Perhaps another book is forthcoming?<br />Anyone wishing to know about this super-secret agency, it's beginnings and it's role in many important 20th century events will be thrilled to read and own this book.	2004-01-12

It was a pure delight to read Franken blowing away the well-oiled, well-financed right-wing propaganda machine. Al takes on all comers, such as Ann Coulter (who was long overdue), Bill O'Reilly, the myth of the liberal media in the 2000 stolen election (which is backed up by a real study) and all the rest.<br />No matter your political persuasion, give this book a look with an open mind and your laughing gun cocked. I would imagine if you are a conservative, you aren't interested, but if you are conservative, you may be surprised at the proof Franken offers up to debunk a lot of characters on the right.<br />I don't want to give it all away, but Al leaves \\"O'Lie-lly,\\" as he calls him, standing naked in public without a towel for the world to see. Exposing Bill's lie about his former show, Inside Edition, winning a Peabody, his voter registration record, and O'Reilly's tactics when someone confronts him with one of his own lies, Al gives Bill what's long been coming to him.<br />Not only is this book a great counterattack to all of the radical schnooks on the right, it's also well documented and researched, unlike Coulter's blarney. I'm not only proud to own the hardcover edition of this book, which I occasionally open up for reading and laughter from time to time, but this book makes me proud to be a Democrat. It's a must have for anyone who is tired of the right wing's incessant lying and distortion of the facts under this current administration. Buy it buy it buy it! I'm waiting with bated breath what Al has to say about Rush's latest slip ups, the latest lies of the right, et al in his next book. I'll buy an advanced copy right now!	2004-01-12

Smith does a great job of describing his experiences in detail about his time spent in Berlin during the first few years of World War II.<br />During the final two-thirds of the book, the reader is a companion to Smith as he describes his increasingly darkening experiences in Berlin, culminating with his departure to Switzerland on the day the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. Following the bombing, the Germans wouldn't allow anyone to leave the country, so Smith just made it.<br />My two chief complaints about the book:<br />1. It ends too early. There are pictures of the author visiting Berlin in 1950 touring the burned out Reichstag, but no details about that. It would have been delightful to read about that, and his impressions of defeated Germany, since Smith spent so much time in Berlin.<br />2. He doesn't add quite enough personal thoughts to his book. For instance, he met the woman that would eventually become his wife in Germany? and there is no mention of it (there's a picture of both of them in the Berlin Tiergarten). A little more of a personal touch would have rounded out the book nicely.<br />However, these are minor complaints about a solid and throught-provoking book.	2002-12-10

Not only has Goodwin thoroughly researched her subject, but she knows how to tell it in an easily readable, \\"can't put it down\\" manner. Writing an informative, wonderfully illustrative book about the home front during mankind's biggest, deadliest war is a feat, but making readers feel as if they are actually living and experiencing that time is another accomplishment altogether. Goodwin does this in a book that will be read hundreds of years from now.<br />Anyone who wishes to get the feel for what it was like during this tumultuous time should buy this book, read it, and then read it again.<br />Many people of FDR's inner circle are profiled and narrated, including Lucy Mercer, the woman FDR fell in love with and nearly divorced Eleanor over; Missy LeHand, FDR's personal assistant whom many referred to as his \\"real\\" wife; as well as Ikes, Morgenthau, Stimson and most importantly, Harry Hopkins.<br />Goodwin also debunks some myths about the FDR presidency, both good and bad. Some World War II \\"Did You Know\\" tidbits covered:<br />1. Nearly 105,000 refugees from Nazism reached the U.S., more than any other country. Palestine was second with 55,000. No one disputes that the number should have been much, much higher, but today's attitudes would lead people to believe that we turned everyone away. Footnote - during FDR's presidency, only 3 percent of the population was Jewish - but 15 percent of his appointments were Jewish. Our greatest wartime president was no Anti-Semite.<br />2. The journey of the St. Louis. The author gives adequate attention to one of the great tragedies of the war, and an enormous stain on FDR's legacy.<br />3. Goodwin thoroughly covers the internment of Japanese-Americans - another enormous stain on FDR's presidency. But what is often ignored is the overwhelming pressure on FDR from a tremendous number of people to confine anyone even remotely related to the Japanese. This should not have mattered to FDR, and tragically, it did. One can only wonder if this was part of FDR's dealmaking mentality to accomplish many of his goals to prepare for and wage war. Quite possibly, if he didn't go along with this tragic idea, he many not have received cooperation on many of his other initiatives. People also tend to forget that this was all out war following a tragic, unprovoked attack. Many of the same things are happening to people of Arab decent following the 9/11 attacks, and the Bush administration doesn't hesitate to throw the rule book or Constitution out the window with people of Arab decent, all in the name of fighting terrorism. Rooting out sympathizers and spies was a principle reason in confining the Japanese. This is not a justification for internment, merely part of the reason.<br />4. Eleanor played a big role in trying to convince Congress to pass legislation that allowed British children to come to the U.S. so they could be out of harm's way during the bombing of Britian. William Schulte of Indiana tried to get the provision expanded to include all European children under 16 - including German Jewish children. The provision never made it to the Senate floor for a vote.<br />Goodwin also covers FDR's reasoning and motives behind lend-lease, the brilliant idea to provide war mat&eacute;riel to the Allies when they couldn't afford it. Even Stalin said that lend-lease was one of the biggest factors in winning the war.<br />In short, this is one of the most informative and educational books written yet about what the home front was like, and the thinking and wisdom that went into many of the decisions about the war. It also offers many wonderful insights into FDR and Eleanor, and their complex relationship that was really more of a partnership.<br />This brilliant tome belongs on any World War II bookshelf.

The book can be read in a few hours. But, give yourself four - you may want to read this again to absorb Albom's moving tribute to his mentor and friend.<br />I was originally drawn to the book out of admiration for Albom's sports writing and his appearances on ESPN, and I'm delighted that I stumbled upon this gem.<br />I won't say much more because I don't want to give away too much about the book - readers should experience its contents on their own. This is a well-written, easy-to-read treasure about what's really important in life, told by a dying man to his prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Morrie's point of view cannot be fully understood by someone not looking death in the eye, but his lessons are thought provoking, memorable and apropos in today's fast-paced, \\"younger is better\\" society.<br />A note about Albom - this is the first book I've read written by him, but it certainly won't be the last. Like any good author - he doesn't tell, he shows. His descriptions of Morrie are vivid - Albom brings him to life. It's not always pleasant, but you feel as if you're in the room with Mitch and Morrie, sharing laughter and tears.<br />I don't hesitate to admit I had plenty of tears at the end of the book, as I'm sure Albom did when he wrote it.<br />...<br />Five stars for Tuesdays with Morrie, and six stars to Albom for sharing.	2002-11-23

This version does give a nice overview of Ike's life, but certainly a biased one. Ambrose does not hide the fact that he is the president of the \\"I Like Ike\\" fan club, but he still offers a great deal about Eisenhower. However, he misses the mark on a few critical areas that should be considered important in any bio of our 34th president.<br /><br />For instance, there is hardly a mention at all about FDR's death on April 12, 1945. Surely the highest ranking American in the European theater had powerful emotions concerning the passing of his president, but the reader is left wondering.<br /><br />Another area getting short shrift is America's use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I find it hard to believe that Eisenhower would not have a strong opinion or at least strong emotions concerning their use. Again, it barely gets a mention in the book.<br /><br />Even if the two-volume set contains information about the above topics, it should have been included in the condensed volume.<br /><br />My other complaint is that the book is slanted entirely toward the good points about Ike's life and presidency. One exception is coverage of Ike's possible affair with his war-time secretary, which Ambrose covers more than adequately.<br /><br />If you like Ambrose, I would rate this as worth the read. It does offer insight to his war experiences and presidency, but for a fairly objective work, consider other tomes.	2002-01-17

It took me a few months to read it, but I wanted to take my time to get something out of reading a book of this length and breadth. It was worth the effort. This is the best overall account yet that I have read about the Third Reich - it's a must have for any serious World War II buff of the European Theater.<br />If you are really intent on learning a great deal from reading the book, take notes, especially of all the names and abbreviations; it can be a bit hard to follow at times.<br />A true masterpiece.	2002-01-03

Kraft has written a marvelous insight into NASA from the administration's early days through the end of Apollo. Kraft made significant and vital contributions to America's getting to the moon; quite frankly he is the key player that many people may not know about. After your read this gem, you'll know.<br />Kraft aknowledges and discusses his significant contributions without hubris; a fine line that many autobiographies fail to tread. He also covers his trials and tribulations early in life with the mental illness of his father and a childhood accident that prevented him from becoming a Navy pilot.<br />Kraft's coverage of the Mercury and Gemini programs is excellent, as is his writing about the early days of Apollo. His discussion about the Apollo 1 fire is painful and sad to read, but very educational. After Apollo 13, his Apollo discussion sadly trails off a bit. He gives brief mention to Apollos 14-17 and even a brief mention of the cancelled 18-20 missions. However, after that, there is virtually no discussion of Skylab or the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, and precious little on the Space Shuttle (perhaps he is as enthusiastic as this writer about the shuttle program). It would have been nice for Kraft to mention the end of his career and NASA's floundering following the end of Apollo. The reader wonders when Kraft left NASA. However, these are very minor complaints to Kraft's major contribution to the history of the space race (a term which he abhors).<br />He makes up for these small omissions by lambasting current NASA leadership for the administration's current state of affairs with the international space station as well as the country's lack of committment to space exploration.<br />This book will thoroughly educate anyone interested in learning how the space race was really won, told by one of its principle architects. Kraft's tome is an outstanding achievement and a must read. It is a treasured book in my library's NASA section.k in my library's NASA section.	2002-01-03
