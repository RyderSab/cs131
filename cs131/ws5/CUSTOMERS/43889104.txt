Because I have just gotten lost in a book written by a master storyteller.  &lt;sigh>  It takes me a few days to come down off the high she's put me on.<br /><br />I always think I'm not going to like the latest one.  Then, by the bottom of page 1, I am sucked in and can't stop reading.  SEP is wicked that way.  I think I'm put off by the blurbs on-line and/or the back of her books.  I'm going to stop reading them because I know I'll get a prime book, no matter what the plot is.<br /><br />I fell in love with Annabelle right off the bat.  What's not to love about a woman who names her car?  I wasn't sure that I would like Heath.  But the 2nd chapter, I was in lust, er, love with him.  And the secondary love story was interesting.  There are several places in this book where I laughed so hard, I fogged my glasses.  Then, I'd have to clean them and read the passage again.  And still laugh.  I can't wait to read this book again!<br /><br />What a grand story.  It was nice to see a bit of the Calebows and Tuckers.  When last we met Miss Victoria Tucker, she could still talk to Daphne and company.  It doesn't matter that she can't do that now.  She is a pistol.  Hang on to your cell phones around her.<br /><br />Because I live on a fixed income, there are only a few authors whose books I would purchase in hardback.  Susan Elizabeth Phillips is one.<br /><br />I can't wait till the next SEP.  Maybe Dean will have a story?  Or Hannah in a few years?  She is so lovable.<br /><br />WTG, Ms. Phillips.  You've won the gold on another one!<br /><br />*Sept 12, 2009.  It's been several years since I wrote this review.  I have re-read this book several times and also have listened to it on audiobook.  If you haven't listened to SEP's books, I highly recommend that you do so.  Delightfully read.	2005-08-30

But I ended up loving it and it's going on my keeper shelf.  I laughed myself silly at some of Prudence & Gideon conversations.  In fact, I loved everybody except the brutal grandfather.  As I was meant to do, of course.<br /><br />This is my first book by Anne Gracie.  Not my last if this is any example.  A perfect summer read.  Or a perfect anytime read.  Gideon is, indeed, the perfect rake.  What a hoot!	2005-07-15

I stopped reading the \\"Cat Who..\\" series a few years back because they were starting to annoy me.  Same basic plot in every book.<br /><br />I picked up several books at the library to take along on vacation this past week.  \\"The Cat Who Went Bananas\\" was in the group.<br /><br />My gosh!  How awful this series has gotten.  When I read the first one, in which Qwill adopts Koko and Yum-Yum, I was completely delighted.  And kept being so for years.  I did read somewhere that Ms. Braun took a few years break in the series before starting it up again.  I'm not sure when that happened.<br /><br />I didn't get very far in to \\"Bananas\\" before I tossed it aside as a lost cause and picked up something else to read. Thanks to all of you who clued me as to why.  I never got to the non-ending.  I believe I left Jim having dinner at some quaintly named restaurant with some even more quaintly named person.  After reading today's reviews, I'm glad I didn't bother.<br /><br />Then, I got to thinking.  I'm 66 and remembered that Ms. Braun is many years older than I.  Did a Google and found that she was born in 1916.  Which would make her 89 at some point in this year of 2005.  Now, I wonder if she's permanently retired and handed over the writing reins to someone else, suffered some debilitating disease which makes writing well (or even at all)impossible for her or if she died and it has been kept a secret from \\"Cat Who...\\" fans.I imagine it's one of those those choices.<br /><br />Whatever the problem is, the greedy publishers are doing her and her past books no service or honor.  Ms. Braun deserves better treatment.<br /><br />One more thought.  Years ago, I decided that Ms. Braun had fallen into the same trap that P. D. James, Martha Grimes and M. C. Beaton have done.  They are in love with their heroes and too jealous to allow them to have a real love life, marry or have a family.  How sad.<br /><br />If any of you ever read the \\"Miss Seeton\\" series by Heron Carvic, you will surely relate it to \\"Cat Who...\\".  After Carvic's death, the series was never as interesting nor as entertaining.  Agatha Christie was a smart author who wrote an ending for Poirot.  Nobody ever tried to fool the public that another writer could do just as well.  Good for her.  And her books have held up through the years.	2005-07-06

It's hard to belive that a book containing so much sex could be boring but this one manages to be just that.  It's pretty much just one long bunch of sex action interspersed with bits of plot.  While I like sex in my romances, I much prefer a good story to go with it.  Sex right after meeting in the middle of snow storm in the back seat of a small car isn't my idea of erotic.  The book seems more like an instructional manual than a novel.  If all the sex scenes were removed, there might be 25 or so pages of story left.  Yikes!  Not a good thing at all!<br /><br />I never \\"got\\" the falling in love between the two main characters.  Neither one is sexy or even interesting.  There is far, far too much internal dialog going on.  Somebody says something.  The other person has a self-dialogue.  Many paragraphs later, he/she responds.  By then, I've forgotten what the original sentence was.  Makes for hard reading.  I found myself skipping ahead to see what was going to happen.  I should have saved myself the trouble as nothing ever did.  The ending can be seen coming a mile away.  Who cares?<br /><br />This is the first book I've read by Ms. Kaufman.  If it's typical, then it will be my last.	2005-04-06

Elvis marries kook.  I thought I was going to enjoy it.  And did for awhile.  However, when Paris got pregnant, it all went downhill.  It slid right into a very serious subject and stayed there for the rest of the book.<br /><br />Frankly, I thought the good reverend deserved a whole lot better and didn't see why he ever loved her in the first place.  Paris is pretty self-centered and selfish.  Never mind that we are constantly told how her deep-seated fear is what drives her.  The woman is 30 years old, for heaven's sake!  Why did she never consider getting a bit of therapy for her problem instead of wallowing in self-pity for so long.  Why didn't somebody else, the nuns/priest for instance, see that she got this help?  It was available 15 years ago.  I don't know about the hormone therapy, but she could have talked to someone, it seems.<br /><br />Turner is far too patient with her.  He is such a sweet guy and a good preacher.<br /><br />Frankly, I am tired of publishers creating the cartoon covers for books that have such angst and seriousness in them.  I don't want a book to be silly and have that called amusing.  I might even have enjoyed this one if I hadn't been lulled into thinking it was going to be a light-hearted read.  Something I needed a lot right now.<br /><br />I don't know if I want to take a chance on another of Ms Macperson's books.  I'll have to think about it.  I'm sure others will love this book and think I'm crazy for not.  But, that's life.	2005-04-02

Indeed, even Hope admits that she's a coward.  For me, her struggle against men/marriage/Conner went on far too long.  So her engagement ended in disaster.  She should have thanked her lucky stars she found out what a slime the guy was before the wedding.  Instead, she keeps comparing our hero to Richard, the slime.  No way.  She leaps to far too many conclusions and has a hard time backing off of them.  In the beginning, Conn forms a conclusion about her but wastes no time in revising that when he gets to know her a bit better.  I do like how she stood up for the old people, how good she was with the boat crew and that she kept on task with her writing.  I just felt her angst was a tad overdone.  I believe the miscarriage could have been handled a bit differently but, I guess, Ms. Martin needed that to be an essential part of her story.<br /><br />On the other hand, I adored Conner.  Great hero.  And the hunt for the Spanish galleon was exciting.  I enjoyed that a lot.  I don't know that I would ever be brave enough to scuba dive but I enjoy reading about it.<br /><br />I've read Ms. Martin for years now and really have enjoyed her whole body of work.  Some more than others, of course.  May she and her word processor continue to turn out good stories.	2005-04-02

Re-read all my other SEP keepers.  That's a plan.<br /><br />Seriously, I bought the paperback version the day it hit the shelves.  I don't buy hardbacks.  Can't afford them and they're not easy to read in bed.  Then, I let the book sit in my TBR box by the bed.  It sat and sat and sat.  I kept reading other stuff.  Was I trying to age it like fine wine?<br /><br />I think the plot synopsis put me off and I was afraid I wouldn't like the book.  Silly me!  I forgot into who's hands I was putting myself.  Once I got into the story, I couldn't put the darned book down.  I read till 4am to finish.<br /><br />Sugar Beth was certainly no misunderstood teen.  She hurt a lot of people before she left them all behind.  Forever, she thought.She put the capital SB in Spoiled Bitch.<br />Colin was wonderful and I could certainly understand his lingering anger at Sugar Beth and his need for revenge.  Their battles were fantastic and I can't wait to read them again.<br /><br />The Sea Willows were a great bunch of women.  I'd like to have them as my friends.  I didn't blame them a bit for getting some of their own back when Sugar Beth was serving them at Colin's party.  They deserved the chance to \\"git 'er\\".<br /><br />The thing that raises this book above all others is the backbone of Sugar Beth and her willingness to take her punishement fairly gracefully.  And the sex is hot, hot, hot.<br /><br />As you can tell, I loved this book after all.  Now it has been moved from the TBR pile to the Keeper shelf.  Deservedly so.  I love SEP's women.  And the men are equally strong.  They have to be to deal with those Amazons.	2005-03-21

But I just can't get into her contemporaries.  And this is the the worst of those.<br /><br />There is no depth to any of these characters.  I could never get a handle on what was going on with them.  Michael seemed to be a jerk.  Ellie I'm not sure exactly what she is.<br /><br />Friend Becky is a total throwaway.  Just there for our heroine to give sage advice to.  First Becky was fine.  She loved her husband and baby.  Then, she was too wimpy to tell him she didn't want to move to Long Island and live next door to her mother-in-law.  Then, she was getting a divorce.  Little pain showing there.<br /><br />Also, a big deal was made of the fact that it was against policy for UN workers to date.  Michael offered to give up his position if he and Ellie got married.  After that, nothing more was mentioned.  What did they do?  Was it OK for a married couple to work together?  He was her boss, after all.  Seems to me an epilogue was called for.  The book just has an unfinished air about it.<br /><br />This book was so boring and I really wanted to like it.  I like this genre.	2004-11-25

They should have been left there and not re-issued.  I've never read Ms. Daily before and picked this up thinking it was new.  I should have checked the first edition dates inside first.  Someday, I'll learn.<br /><br />In \\"The Lord of the High Lonesome\\" we have a 21 year old brat named Kit.  She is angry all the time, nasty to everybody and doesn't give anyone a chance.  She dresses in baggy, ratty men's clothes, wears on old cowboy hat to hide her \\"glorious\\" hair and is, generally, loathesome to family, employees and townspeople alike.  No wonder the hero fell madly in love with her.  What's not to love?  I couldn't even finish it.  I did skip to the end to see how they worked it out.  Ugh.<br /><br />In \\"Heart of Stone\\" we have Kit's opposite.  An arrogant, overbearing, cruel man.  When we first meet him, he has a blond bimbo installed in his suite at the inn he owns.  He is nasty to our TSTL heroine and, pretty much, lets her know a threesome would be interesting.  Again, we can see why she fell head over heels for the jerk.  He dumps her cruelly and goes away for many months.  She pines.  She loses weight.  She cries a lot.  She \\"looves\\" him forver.  One day, he waltzes back in to her life, tells her he's sort of sorry, that he loves her and will she marry him.  After all the pain he put her through, she falls into his arms and ecstatically accepts his proposal.  No pride or self-esteem, at all!<br /><br />I'm not sure how Ms. Daily's current writings stack up against this garbage and I guess I won't find out.  I don't want to risk another penny to find out.<br /><br />Save your money for something better.  The back of a cereal box would be my recommendation.	2004-11-22

I didn't like &#34;Almost Like Being in Love&#34; at all.  It wasn't till Pepper's sister, Hope, appears that I realized I neither liked nor finished her story in &#34;Just the Way You Are&#34;.  I can't remember why for that one.  I didn't like Hope, I think.  I didn't finish this one either.  I skipped around.  Hoping it would get better.  It didn't.  I did check out the ending.  &#60;sigh&#62;  I should have just left it at the store.<br /><br />And I can't think of a recent heroine that I've disliked more than Pepper Prescott.  Sheesh!  That chip on her shoulder was the size of a redwood.  I really, really don't like &#34;prickly&#34; heroines.  She is awful!  Why he loved her, I'll never know.<br /><br />On top of that, it's hard to believe that she ran away after her first sexual encounter.  And that she's still mad at Dan Graham for some reason.  In fact, she stays mad at just about everybody and everything.  The romance part wasn't very believable.  Nor or we told why she kept travelling under an assumed name for so many years.  Well, there was the lame excuse that she was afraid to find out her sisters and brother wouldn't want her if she ever found them. Right!<br /><br />I'm no expert on the army/terrorist stuff that is presented. But, it didn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  For me, it was too far-fetched that both sets of villains got together and stormed the ranch.  The whole plot is far too over-done.<br /><br />I guess there are 2 more books to come in this series.  Brother Gabriel and baby sister Caitlin.  The latter was less than a year old when the family was broken up. I  am making a note to self right now to give them a pass.<br /><br />All in all, I think Ms. Dodd should stick to her historicals.  She does so well there where not many do.	2004-10-08

The more I read, the more I liked.  Simon and Jorie are terrific together.  It would have been nice to have other characters fleshed out a bit more.  But there is only so much space in a book and I'd rather have devoted to the h/h relationship.<br /><br />A lovely book to read by the fire or at the beach.	2004-10-06

Then, I bought it on impulse at Walmart.  Am I ever glad I did!  What a wonderful read!  I love Soldier and Betsy.  I hope that Ms. Stillings is hard at work on a story/stories for Taylor and Claire.<br /><br />After reading two books in a row that drove me nuts, I was beginning to think there was something wrong with my \\"reading bone\\".  Not so!  It just took some excellent writing, some interesting characters and a neat plot to gather me back into the fold.<br /><br />The first hint that I was going to enjoy the heck out this book was the result of the writing workshop that Soldier and Betsy attended.  I laughed so hard that my eyes would tear up and I'd have to read it again.  It took me several minutes to be able to get through it.  It was priceless.  I thought that would be my favorite part of the book.  However, it was soon transplanted by the Dick & Jane type dialog the pair engaged in.  Who knew a children's primer could be so sexy?  LOL<br /><br />I like the way that the villain isn't given away till nearly the end.  And the fact that said villain didn't get in the way of a neat romance.  Although just about everybody else did when things were about to reach their peak.  If you catch my meaning.  Can we say frustrated?<br /><br />So, I am ever so happy to give this book the complete 5 star rating.  I will be on the lookout for Ms. Stillings's next books.	2004-09-06

Maybe because I read them all one right after the other.  This one, I had to wait several months for.  In the meantime, I've read dozens of other books.<br /><br />I think the idea of all 4 stories taking place at the same time is an interesting one.  I just don't feel that it works to well in the long run.<br /><br />In \\"Beyond a Wicked Kiss\\", there are so many mysterious comings, goings and doings that even I, who'd read the other three books, got confused.  I can only imagine how a reader who only reads this one would feel.<br /><br />I really looked forward to West's story.  I could never shake the feeling that the book contained bits and pieces from the other books and never really came together.<br /><br />If ever an epilogue was called for, it's this series.  It screams for one.  I was so disappointed that the 4 couples didn't get together at the end.  And that I didn't get to see how the women got on with each other.<br /><br />If you've read the first 3 books, then you might want to give this one a go.  If you haven't I strongly recommend that you do so before you tackle this one.<br /><br />That said, I'm looking forward to Ms. Goodman's next book.  I like her style and her writing is wonderful.  Not a TSTL heroine in sight.	2004-08-22

Nearly all of SEP's books are on my keeper shelf and are dog-eared from re-reads.  This will, no doubt, be one of them<br />One previous reviewer was turned off because Isabel was dowdy and plain.  She wasn't!  She just dressed a different way and had worked hard to make herself appear professional.<br />The best thing about this book, other than the tour of Tuscany, is the banter and sizzle between Ren and Isabel.  She doesn't take his guff and he is caught by that.  He's bored by women throwing themselves at him.  They are a perfect match.<br />I thought the hunt for the fertility statue could have been left out, but it did serve to introduce some delightful characters.  Also, the secondary romance of Ren's ex-wife and her estranged husband was wonderful.<br />I enjoyed the heck out of this book both times I've read it.  No doubt, I will again some other winter's night.	2004-01-17

I had never read Ms. Albert's work and thought I was gettting something along the lines of a Rachel Gibson book.  Not even close!<br /><br />Lucky for me, I loved the book.  I could tell that Bobby came from previous stories but this book stands on it's own merits.  Well done.  I didn't see the almost-end coming.<br /><br />I like that Emma is such a strong person and that she did a hard thing in turning in some bad cops back in LA.  And that she weathered the consequences with grace.  Even tho that happened before this book begins, we are told how this has affected her and we see how that helps her to help Bobby, who has his own demons.<br /><br />I was surprised to find myself liking Chloe.  I hope she gets her own story one of these days.  And, even tho he had a small part, I would like to see a story about the intriguing Gary Giacomo, beat cop.<br /><br />So, my advice is to totally ignore the stupid cover and the equally stupid backcover summary.  Read this book for pleasure.  Not for laughs.	2003-09-30

I enjoyed the story very much and can't wait to read the other 2 books.<br />I come from a large family but I found the Marcellis a bit off-putting.  The grandfather, especially, is pretty unlovable.  I hope he gets better in the next books.  The older Marcelli women are kind of cute.  I liked how they all pulled together to help Katie out in a major crisis.<br />However, it was the story of Zach and Katie that I enjoyed the most.  I like that the story unfolded over months rather than a week or two.  (One of my pet peeves is forever after occuring in just a few days).  The respect they had for each other from the beginning was wonderful.  Even as they disagreed on what to do about the young engaged couple.  Her sister, his son.  Both 18.  Yikes!<br />Another thing I like was the progression of the relationship of the youngsters.  It was presented in a pretty lifelike manner, I feel.  I don't want to spoil the story for anyone who hasn't read the book so I won't detail the outcome of their engagement.  Let's just say I'm glad things worked out the way they did. It was nice to see the women working together the way they did.  Gramps could learn a lesson there.  Not a likeable man.<br />It was good to see that Katie didn't back down in the face of Zach's unsubtle attempt at blackmail.  She is my kind of heroine.  Smart and determined without falling into the TSTL category.  (Another pet peeve)  She has her fears and that makes her very human and easy to relate to.<br />All in all, I do recommend reading this book.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.	2003-09-23

Since I couldn't sleep, I read this whole book in one sitting.  Well, I did get a meal or 2 and go potty occasionally.  But why waste a perfectly good storm being nervous when you can get caught up in somebody's else problems?<br />I enjoyed the story.  I don't know much about hockey but knowledge of the game isn't a requirement to get a kick out of this book.  I liked both Janna and Ty.  Even though I wanted to kick his rear end fairly often.  Which I'm sure Janna did too.  I liked the fact that she was willing to go in the face of her inner fears and do what needed to be done to get the job done.  Good going, Janna!<br />I do have a quibble or 2.  I would like to have seen the secondary characters more fleshed out.  They are too peripheral to the amount of time that passes in the story.  A whole hockey season.  However, I do like that the romance took up the whole season and not a quickie weekend.<br />Quibble #2 is that too many threads are left dangling.  I know that friend Theresa and, I guess, hockey player Michael will have their story down the road.  However, being an epilogue junkie, I would love to have seen one here that took care of some of those loose threads.<br />Emma's parents?  Her little brother?  Her sisters?  These last 2 never seemed quite real, by the way.  Ms. Donovan states that Emma love her sister Petra &lt;?&gt; So why did they never get together and do lunch once in awhile?<br />Quibble #3 is a biggie for me.  What the heck is Ty going to do now?  this would have been very nice in an epilogue.  It's hard to believe that a guy who was so totally fixated on the Stanley Cup and winning-at-all-costs for so many years, could just walk away without a pang or backward glance.  He didn't seem to agonize over this at all.	2003-09-19
US	43889104	RPKJSUP0MN699	1551666618	274925781	Impetuous Innocent	Books	1	9	15	N	N	Should NOT Have Been Re-issued!	What a disappointment.  I always check the issue date in the front of a book.  So, I knew when I bought it that it was one of Ms. Lauren's earlier works.  I'm glad to report she has improved greatly since this stinker.  Too many hurdles for me to get over.<br /><br />First was the fact that the heroine was barely 18 and the hero is a very experienced 32.  Eww!  2nd is the fact that nothing much happens in this book.  No sexual tension, no emotions, no nothing.<br /><br />I don't know about historical accuracy and don't much care if the plot entertains me.  Not a stickler for that.  The biggest stumbling block in this book for me is the fact that Georgie falls squarely into the TSTL category.  I kept picturing her with the little girl voice that Mary Tyler Moore used in \\"Thoroughly Modern Millie\\".  Only much less amusing.<br /><br />Plus the fact that she could never believe Dominic loved her so she kept doing really dumb things to let him go.  Why he cared, I'll never know.  Even his mistress was more interesting the Georgie.  Frankly, it reeks too much of the dirty old man syndrome.<br /><br />Oh well.  I've vented now and feel much better.  I'm just happy that I bought this book 1/2 price at a used book store.  Where it belongs.  And where it will soon be returned.	2003-09-08
US	43889104	R1HN8BD7O0M8NL	0373292708	19635445	High Plains Wife	Books	2	19	23	N	N	Disappointing	I really wanted to like this book but didn't.  I liked the plot of the town spinster marrying and bringing love to the embittered widower and his children.  I can even understand the need of a man, whose wife died only weeks before by committing suicide, to acquire a new wife quickly to take care of his house and his children.  Farm/ranch life has never been easy.  Especially, 120 years ago.<br /><br />My problem with the book is that it's so boring.  One of the worst sins a book can have, I think.  Nothing much happens.  She's a 28-year old spinster, he's newly widowed.  She had a mean father, he had a slut for a wife.  Apparently, years before, when they were both teens, he came calling and was turned away by her father.  So, he got drunk, got some other girl pregnant and married her.  Her father, in the meantime, belittled her at every opportunity and she came to believe what he said.  It happens.  We all carry those internal tapes from our parents and they get replayed at the darndest times.<br /><br />However, and this is the biggie for me,  these two people are caught up in their own individual pity parties.  Especially, Nick.  He kept telling himself that Mariah was nothing like his late wife.  But, when he found himself attracted to her, he ran scared and acted like a total idiot.  What Mariah found to love about Nick totally escapes me.<br /><br />And we are beat over the head repeatedly by Ms. Hart with every other page re-iterating their individual feel-sorry-for-myself shallowness.  Hard to believe these are 2 adults.  The kids are more mature.  This story could have been told in half the number of pages if we stupid readers didn't have to be constantly reminded of why the h/h act the way they do.	2003-09-03

I got it because I wanted to read about Maris McKenzie.  It was very satisfying to me.  I love the McKenzie family.<br />Debbie Macomber and Linda Howard also contributed a good story each.  The only reason I give this book 4 stars is the stories were too short.  I prefer these authors in longer formats.	2003-07-16

I gave 3 stars because of the flow of the words and the sparkly dialogue.  But I had problems staying with the story.<br /><br />My first problem is with the disguise thing.  It was OK if you go for the hooker look  My big complaint is the constant bubble gum.  It drove me crazy very quickly.  It wasn't needed and got in the way of the story.  It was like hearing someone use the word \\"basically\\" to begin every sentence.  Arrgh!<br /><br />Next, I have a definite problem with h/h meeting and falling into bed shortly.  Only to call it for real and everlasting love.  1 1/2 days before sex is pretty much shortly.  Lust I can believe in.  Not true love.<br /><br />Editing is sloppy.  When Cole's hippie parents arrive, we are told that Joplin re-named herself after her favorite OD'd rock star, Janice.  This was corrected to Janis on the next page and not repeated.  Then, more toward the end, the twins are mentioned.  Huh?  I believe the \\"twins\\" were triplets.  Stuff like that just jerks me right out of any story.  No excuse for it.  What else do editors have to do but edit?<br /><br />The whole story takes place in too short a time frame for all that Juliet/Autumn accomplishes.  Tending bar at night, nanny to 5 small girls by day.  3 in diapers.  And solving everybody's problems while she's at it. Painting Joe's Gas and Bait Shop in her spare time.  Having hot sex with Cole whenever.  All this in 3-4 days and without breaking a nail or chipping her pink polish.  As far as I could tell, she only slept one night in the whole book.  Wish I could do that.<br /><br />I enjoyed the crazy villaness.  She was pretty obsessive.  Sort of reminded me of Ursula the sea witch in \\"The Little Mermaid\\".  But she gets a nice comeuppance at the end.<br /><br />I know there was at least 1 previous book set in Plentiful, Wyoming.  I haven't read it.  It doesn't really matter as this book stands alone.  Even though characters from the previous book are here.  And they are characters.  Which is as it should be in a small town.  Characters help the story move along.<br /><br />A lot of stuff happens in this book.  Too much, I think.  The malpractice thing could have been left on the editing floor.  It didn't really advance the plot.<br /><br />I'm glad I read the book but it won't be going on my keeper shelf.  But I will read future Berg books.	2003-07-16

The h/h can laugh even in the middle of sex and I love the dialogue between the two. TG for a book without a TSTL heroine.  The sex is awesome.  For the squeamish, be warned there is some oral sex but I didn't find it offensive.<br />I loved the Quinn family.  Makes me want to be a part of them.<br />\\"Knock Me Off My Feet\\" is a wonderful summer read.  And I'm delighted to make the acquaintance of a new (to me) author.  I can't wait to get my hands on \\"Take A Chance On Me\\".	2003-07-11
US	43889104	R1RZWQMUEY7BB6	0743419170	585902307	Secret Ways	Books	3	3	6	N	N	Not Her Best!!	I enjoyed the heck out of \\"The Fire Inside\\" and \\"Fanning the Flame\\".  In fact, I was leery of reading Ms. Martin's contemporary books, but was pleasantly surprised there.<br /><br />This book is a bit of a mess.  I'm pretty good at suspending belief.  It did bother me that the heroine was 18 at the start and celebrated her 19th birthday during the course of the story, but I perservered anyway.  However, I fell from my suspension with a bang when I read that she'd purchased a house 2 years before and filled it with unwed mothers.  Wait a minute!  That would mean she was 16 at the time she did this.  In Regency England, no less.  I don't think so!  It would next to impossible for a 16-year-old in out own time to do such a thing.  Granted she was rich and was given a lot of leeway.  But still....<br /><br />After that, I found some other discrepencies which spelled very slopping editing and I just couldn't get back into the story.  Not a keeper for me.  However, I hope that Ms. Martin will recover from this and give us stories about Caleb's brothers, Luc and Christian.  Plus a story about the intriguing Mark Sutton.  Hope springs eternal for me.	2003-07-02
US	43889104	R3LX3T1FJ7AEON	0440241111	729777684	Slightly Scandalous	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Fun	I really didn't expect to like this book since Freyja was not very likeable in previous books.  Plus authors often don't present the story of the sisters in a family series too well.  Don't know why that is.  However, we are dealing with Mary Balogh here, so.......<br />Even though it took me awhile to warm up to Freyja, I loved Joshua right of the bat.  Their arguments were great although I feel there was too much fist throwing by Free.  Once, to prove she was a Bewcastle, would have been plenty.  Well, the one toward the end of the book was satisfying.  But beating up on the hero more than once was too much.<br />All in all, I enjoyed the book a lot.  Now, I want to read the stories of the other 3 Bewcastles.  Even though Wulfric reminds me a lot of Jo Beverly's Rothgar, I'm sure he'll be my favorite.  I love a good brooding, emignatic hero.<br />I did like the fact that the three &quot;Slightly....&quot; books were published one month after another.  At no loss of quality.  Ms. Balogh is truly at the top of her field.	2003-06-12

How sad.  2 of my favorite authors, Debbie Macomber and Judith Bowen, participated in this very boring book.  I didn't like any of the characters.  Perhaps because these stories were shorter. but the protagonists personalities just didn't come thru.  Plus the falling in love forever in 2 weeks or less just doesn't hold my interest.<br />In all 3 stories, I kept waiting for something to happen.  It never did.  The 3rd story was the worst.  My Secret Valentine should have been left on the editorial cutting room floor.  What a mess.  I like stories where I know what both sides are thinking.  The heroine is of the TSTL variety and I wanted to slap her just about every other sentence.<br />Dull, dull, dull describes this book and these stories fully.  I know Ms. Macomber and Ms. Bowen can do much better.  I'm not sure the other author has a clue on how to write an interesting story.<br />Save your money unless you are a masochist.	2003-05-26

I enjoyed every word.  And Barrie was a good match for Zane.  Linda Howard is a master story teller.<br />I also like Beverly Barton but didn't care as much for Defending His Own as I have some of her other books.  Secret baby stories bore me so that's probably the reason.  Also, I don't much care for stories where something happens to a character as a teen and he/she holds it against the world forever.  Good grief!  We all grow and mature.  Some of these people never do.  Along with the secret baby, this is an over-used and unnecessary plot device.  It creaks.	2003-05-26
US	43889104	R2FA6VGYLS7YW9	0505524813	63291784	The Misconception	Books	5	4	8	N	N	Delightful!	I wasn't sure about this book.  I've never read this author but, if this is any example, I look forward to her future work.  I laughed out loud in more than one place.<br />Other reviewers have already given the synopsis so I won't bother.  Let me just say I'm in love with Jax.  What a very differnt hero he is.  As opposed to stubborn cowboys, brooding heros, and other anti-commitment guys.  His occupation is wonderful (even tho I'm not a fan) and I won't give it away here.  Get the book and find out for yourself.  I don't think you'll be sorry.<br />One reviewer said the book needed more sensuality.  I disagree.  It's perfect just as it is. There's plenty of books around with all the sensuality anyone could want.  I like that but I love a sense of humor also.  Ms. Gardiner done good!	2002-09-03

Naturally, I had to grab this one quickly.  It was a quick read.<br />Bear in mind that I enjoy Ms. McAllister's work.  However, I didn't like this book as much as previous in the series.  J.D. McCall in &quot;A Cowboy's Secret&quot; is one of the outstanding ones.  I did perservere and this one  it got better toward the end.<br />I'm not totally sure why this didn't work for me.  I think I didn't like Celie all that much.  In her mind, it was all about her.  So, she got jilted at the ripe old age of 19 and didn't even so much as look at another guy for 10 years.  Then, she lives in a fantasy about Sloan Gallagher for all those years.  Never dating a real guy.  How mature is that?  Jace deserves better.  And it really wasn't his fault that her ex-fiancee, Matt, jilted her.  It doesn't say in this book, but in &quot;The Great Montana Cowboy Auction&quot; the author tells us that Matt was wild going down the road and that he's since been married/divorced a couple of times.  Whatever. Celie should have been thanking Jace instead of hating him all those years.<br />Maybe my real problem is that I enjoyed &quot;The Great Montana Cowboy Auction&quot; so much that &quot;A Cowboy's Pursuit&quot; is a bit of a let down.<br />Having said that, I did enjoy the ending very much and am looking forward to the next in the series.<br />BTW, congratulations on your 50th book, Ms. McAllister.	2002-06-12

I wasn't too sure I would like it at first, but I certainly did. I laughed a lot at the poor old hero, Grey. His mail-order bride plans just sort of blew up in his face. He was wonderful.  And heroine Dora is the kind I like the best.  She has boot straps to spare.  What a neat love story.<br />I love the stories that are done in the Outer Banks. The hurricaine in this story really happened. If you've ever lived thru one, you'll certainly empathize with these folks as they live thru it and pick up in the aftermath.	2002-05-29

Smart, self-confident, knows what she wants and how to get it.  It's lovely to watch Devin go from the dark hell of debauchery and enthalldom to a truly vicious mistress to the love and life that Miranda offers him.  And how she gets him to that point is wonderful to watch.<br /><br />I really appreciated the fact that Miranda is not of the Too Stupid To Live variety.  Or the fact that h/h didn't fight from page 1 till the next to the last page before they called it \\"love\\".  Their fights were believeable and fun to watch.  They progressed the story. All in all, a very satisfying read.  I highly recommend.	2002-04-29

I would have done better to toss it and find something more interesting to read.<br />There was absolutely NO emotion by any of the characters in this book.  The only reason the reader would know there was any was because the author said so.<br />And the ending was so murky, it's a definite let down.  Why had the villain plotted revenge for 30 years?  For what?  The tragic event took place more than 58 years before.  How would that have affected the villain?<br />I felt that a lot of pages got left somewhere.  Jammed in a fax machine?  Eaten by the author's dog?  Don't know and don't care.  If this is an example of Ms. Simmons work, I don't care to read anything else.  This one goes to the used book store ASAP.  Hopefully, to be traded for something worth reading.<br />Save your money for a good book with a decent plot and real emotions.	2002-04-08

A home for unwed mothers.  Prudence and Brock are made for each other.<br />The most delightful thing about the book is the people you think you're going to hate end up being good guys.  Even the villain gets the correct come-uppance in the end and turns out to be sort of OK.<br />The unwed mothers add much to the story. They don't seem to be just incidental. And their stories are so individual.  I got teary at a certain point in the book but don't want to give away that part of the story by telling of it here.  For the most part, the book is fairly upbeat and lovely read.<br />Get it used or from your library.  But read it.  Now, I want to read some others of Ms. Criswell's books.  This was her first for me.	2002-01-26

However, I've enjoyed Ms. Simmons other books that I've read.  This one proved to be no exception.<br />Nicholas made me laugh.  So hell bent on revenge only to be caught up in confusing emotions about his bride.  And Gillian was perfect.  She had a temper and a brain.  But she isn't of the<br />Too-Stupid-To-Live variety of heroine.  She had good reason to fear Nicholas and lived accordingly as she learned more about him.<br />Their romance grew so naturally.  Love didn't happen in a day or a week.  I don't like books where \\"forever\\" happens in a very short time.  I almost cried when Nicholas called her back from death.<br />My only reason for the 4 stars is I would like to have had some of the secondary characters fleshed out a bit more.  I figured out there is a previous book about Nick's sister, Aisley and The Red Knight.  Got to find that!  I would like to have known more about Darius.  And Gillian's brother never seemed real.  I felt he was sort thrown in to give a bit of fireworks toward the end.  Oh well.	2002-01-26

There is 0% chemistry between the Mark and Courtney.  I found it difficult to understand what drew him to her in the first place.  And it seemed a bit spooky that this supposed hunk was obsessed with her for a whole year.  To the point of watching her boardroom antics on video over and over again. Eww!<br /><br />As for M. Billingham Bootle...  Eccentric is not the word I would have for him.  Mean to the max is more like it.  He should be locked away at the funny farm for good.<br /><br />Courtney is exasperating.  She is supposed to be a bright, on-the-ball exectuive.  Could have fooled me.  I wanted to shake her more than once and tell her to get a grip.  And to think of somebody besides her poor pitiful self.  This woman is almost 30 and she's comparing hunk Mark to some pimple-face jock way back in high school.  To Mark's detriment.  Sheesh!  Did she stop her mental development back then?<br /><br />OK  You can tell I didn't like this book and wish I'd saved my hard earned money for something more enjoyable.

Not being into vampire or time travel genres.  Not that this is either of those.  I've just never read sex scenes between a ghost and a human.<br />I thought the most interesting part of the book was the descriptions of how hard life was for women alone in the frontier west with no man to take care of them nor protect them.  I could believe that Ms. Hohl did her research on this and believe the abuse of these young girls and how they really had to choice on how to survive except on their backs.<br />I don't know if it was because Jonathon was a ghost or what but the romance part didn't really grab me. Hence the 4 stars. I did fall in love with Wade Dunston.  Those broody alpha males really get to me. &lt;G&gt;<br />All in all, it's a pretty good read.  Joan Hohl gets us again.	2001-11-24

Talk about self-sufficent!  She can make a knife using an antler and a bit of glass.  A very sharp knife!<br />I liked Rye also and understand his need to be loved for himself rather than his riches.  Although he's a bit hard on Lisa when he first meets her, he is drawn to her like the proverbial moth to the flame.  Their love is very sweet.<br />There is a sequel to this book.  It's about Cynthia McCall, Rye's sister.  It's called &quot;Dark Fire&quot;.  I don't think it's as good as this book but did enjoy it.

Maclean	Books	3	4	4	N	N	So-So Read	I didn't enjoy this book nearly as much as \\"A Loving Man\\" or \\"The Daddy Candidate\\" which are 2 other books related to the characters in this one.<br /><br />For one thing, I don't enjoy stories where the anger is so high and goes on for so long. I couldn't figure out why J. D.MacLean was so angry at Katherine Dalton Kelly. He was the one who sent her away quite harshly when she was 18. Then, he got mad because she married a guy 20 years older than she. So, 20 years later, he's going to get revenge on the lovely widow. She still hates him for sending her away when she was 18 years old.<br /><br />Sheesh, people! Grow up! I realize some tension is needed in a story, but their \\"hatred\\" and anger they kept going for 20 years was not it. I just didn't feel all that anger translated well into sexual tension nor \\"love\\".<br /><br />I really like Cait London and read just about everything I can get my hands on that she has written. This was an early book so maybe she was experimenting with different styles.	2001-11-03

I've read others of Ms. Michael's works and was glad to note this is an early one.<br /><br />I read the whole book through but am not sure why.  There was nothing lovable about Katherine that I could see.  I haven't seen so much jumping to the wrong conclusions in ages!  And is she ever whiny!  Even if it is in her head.  In fact, what goes on in her head and what comes out of her mouth in interaction with others makes her sound like a split personality.<br /><br />There is absolutely NO chemistry between Katherine and Stephen!  Not emotional and, certainly, not sexual.  They lived together for months and only shared one kiss?  And this told her how much she really loved him?  Sheesh!  Spare me!<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me was that the whole story is told from her point of view.  We never get inside of Stephen's head to know what the heck's going on with him.  He doesn't appear to be desperate for women so why he wants this loser is beyond me.<br /><br />In fact, everybody in the whole book is just too one dimensional for me.  And too many loose ends were left dangling. I'm not even going to donate this book to the library.  Into the trash it goes!<br /><br />I'm sure happy to know that Ms. Michael's writing skills have improved vastly since she wrote this drivel.	2001-11-02

I learned a lot about how the hearing-impaired get on in the world. And even picked a few signs to make.<br />My only quibble was I would like to have had Claire deal a bit more with Nash's world that what was shown at the end. I'd like to have seen a bit of interaction with the Marilyn to see how that friendship developed. Also, I'm a sucker for a good epilogue. Preferably, a year or more down the road. This one was a month later. I enjoyed the wedding and and the wedding night but it was too short a time span to suit me.<br />However, it's definitely worth trying to find. I got it at an online auction.	2001-09-17
US	43889104	R24JY5RIEBMCA4	0380782340	229000740	Nobody's Baby But Mine	Books	5	0	0	N	N	My Favorite	This is my favorite of the Stars football team books. It was also the first one I read. I loved how Cal and Jane found each other's hearts. It was great how she and his mom stood up to their men. I laughed a lot.<br /><br />Heaven, Texas, another Stars book, is pretty darned close to this book as my favorite SEP book.<br /><br />Gosh. I think I'm going to have to dig them all out of my keeper shelf and re-read them. And it won't be the first time I've done that. &lt;G><br /><br />Find them. Read them. If you have a funny bone at all, you won't be sorry you did.<br /><br />*Sept 12, 2009<br />  I now have all of SEP's books in audio form.  The reader is the late  Kate Fleming/Anna Fields.  She is wonderful.  All her fans miss her very much.  She & SEP had a great bond.<br /><br />If you haven't listened to any of SEP's books, I recommend that you do so.	2001-09-07
US	43889104	R1OUBT7946U0SN	0373243979	131255849	Race To The Altar	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Disappointed	I was pleased to see a book that didn't feature a cowboy or a millionaire executive. I'm not a NASCAR fan personally, but several of my family members are.<br /> My disappointment was in Rick Castles. He was just too childish and petulant about having a woman in the pit. Even after he knew how good she was at her PR job, he was still trying to undermine her. Good grief! Just because he had one girlfriend who was scared to death of the races. Gimme a break!<br />Liz Mallory was a delight and far too good for this schmuck. I was glad to see that she could be atracted to Rick and still function well in her job. Although I'm not sure how she could make him look good to the public and keep her self-respect. &lt;G&gt; And that she was willing to learn about the racing circuit in order to make her job go more smoothly was a definite plus.<br />I gave the book 3 stars because of the NASCAR theme and because of the strong heroine. Took away 2 because the hero is such an idiot.  Not on my keeper shelf.	2001-09-03

If I could give 0 stars, I would!<br />I was put off in a major way by the fact that the h/h each got their 5-year-old daughers to lie for them. And told them that this was a special case so it was OK to lie this one time. Ugh! This set the tone for the whole mess.<br />I couldn't even finish the book, I was so annoyed. Heroine is whiny and self-center. Hero is not much better.  I did check at the end to see how the story was resolved and was glad I didn't waste my time and temper.<br />I'm glad I didn't get this book when it was new and pay full price for it. I got it as part of bunch of other books at auction. So it wasn't a total waste of money when I got some good books in the deal.<br />Don't even bother trying to find this one. Unless you are in to whiny, manipulative people who are rotten parents in the bargain.	2001-09-03

I was put off by the title as I don't like books where the h/h meet and fall in love forever in just a few days. However, I opened the book and found they'd been friends since childhood. Whew!<br /> This was such a cute book. I stayed up late reading it. I liked Fletch and Bren both. I hate to quibble with the previous reader, but Fletch never did agree to marry Dominique. If you'll remember, he was an A1 procrastinator and was going to take that week to decide if he did want to marry her. Almost immediately, he started noticing Bren as a woman instead of the little girl/one of the guys/best friend way he has always viewed her.<br />It takes him no time at all to realize that Bren is the one he wants to grow old with.<br /> Dominique was never in the running. She is pretty peripheral anyway and we only see her twice in the whole book. Although her name crops up quite often.<br /> This is a nice beach/fireside book. For any season. A feel good kind of book. When you're done, share it with someone else.	2001-09-03

However, this case was of short duration. And it helped to bring the characters closer together. The idea behind the amnesia, I'm sure. I would like to have gotten to know Connor's father and brothers a bit. But most of the Born in the USA series are a bit short of secondary relationships of the main characters. Not enough room to develop them, I suspect. A nice beach read.	2001-08-27
US	43889104	RRLWNKE4U3W1K	0373056192	754377055	Night Light	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Charming!	Sort of a beauty and the beast type story. I would love to see that house/castle. I very much enjoy Ms. Greene's stories. This one is a bit light but that may be because I read it right after I read &quot;Night of the Hunter&quot;. &quot;Hunter&quot; is my favorite Green book so far. This one is a nice read. Her heroines are always people I would like to know or be like. Strong, self-sufficient women who don't shy away from getting their man.	2001-08-27
US	43889104	RRQI6A6VZY80K	0373761295	150864199	Baby In His In - Box (Man Of The Month) (Desire)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Cute Story	While I like others of Ms. Greene's books better, this one was fairly cute. I enjoy the fact that, in the books I've read so far, her women are as strong as the men and don't fold in the face of all that testosterone being flung around. I'm not sure how I felt about the baby. He seems to be pretty awful and I could sure sympathize with his mother for giving him to his dad! He's more out-of-control than a 1 year old ought to be. And I love babies/kids! I'm a mother of 7 and grandmother of 13 & great-grandmother of 2. Maybe I've been around too many of this type of baby. This is a good beach book. Or, a good getting-snowed-in book. Not filling but fun.	2001-08-25
US	43889104	R18RAHB464WNFD	0373054815	704957389	Night Of The Hunter (Man of the Month) (Silhouette Desire #481)	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Wonderful!	I loved both Tanner and Charly! And George the owl, of course. What a lovely romance between two lonely people. And heartwarming to see Charly come to see that she is a beautiful, desirable woman. I'm so tired of wimpy women who become totally helpless in the face of the man's seductions. I got this book in a group of other Greene books I bought at on-line auction. I can't wait to read the others!	2001-08-24
