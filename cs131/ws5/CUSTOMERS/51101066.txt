Grant is impatient with himself for thinking that the notorious king looks more like a judge than a criminal. <br />  <br /> So from his bed, and with a little help from American student Brent Carradine, Grant takes on history, and researches the case with a detective's eye. <br />  <br /> Richard is innocent, he decides. Bit by bit, like drops of cream in coffee, Tey introduces the facts of the case-- not what people said, or reported long after the fact, but what they did. <br />  <br /> This is by far one of the best, if not the best, mysteries from that great fount of paperback mysteries, England. This book is the definition of &quot;page-turner.&quot; People who know nothing of Richard III, and have never cared really, whether the historical rcerd is correct, will not only be fascinated by this story, but will, after putting it down, be ready to carry the banner of Richard's innocence. <br />  <br /> One warning: do not begin this book late in the day. You will probably want to read it cover-to-cover, so if you do not start reading early enough, you will end up losing a night's sleep.	2004-08-01

But to girls who read these books, Nancy Drew is as real as a best friend.<br /><br /> I know many people complain that syndicated series like Nancy Drew, The Hardy Boys and The Three Investigators are of little literary merit because they are ghost-written. This is not strictly true for Nancy Drew, but even so, I see no real reason to pronounce these books as inferior to single author, non-serial books.<br /><br /> Nancy Drew is leading its fourth generation of girls to reading, something that can't be said of all of the supposedly &quot;better&quot; books.<br /><br /> The Sign of the Twisted Candles is one of the best books in the series, and an early one; as such, it is a great introduction to Nancy Drew (you don't miss anything by not reading the books in order). It's compelling, and just chilling enough for a thrill, but not for a real scare. It's suitable for any girl who reads well enough to read &quot;chapter&quot; books, which can be girls as young as seven. Once a girl picks up the Nancy Drew habit, she is generally hooked for life. She'll read the books into her early teens, and may even occasionally turn back to favorite books as an adult.<br /><br /> The new Sign of the Twisted Candles is available, and the new book is very good, but if the girl for who it is bought keeps up with Nancy Drew, check the used book listings for an older version of the story. The early books were all updated in the sixties, so different versions exist. The 1930's & 40's 200+ page book were not only brought up to date with regard to inflation, cultural references and such, but were also reduced to 176 pages.<br /><br /> Don't let the girls you know miss out on Nancy Drew.	2004-07-30

I still recommend it to everyone I know, adults included. <br />  <br /> This book taught me literary analysis, with its powerful characterizations. I was always discovering something new about this book, and the people in it. It's rare that a mystery is so compelling as to beg repeated readings, but this one does. <br />  <br /> It's also just a great mystery; why are the heirs gathered together at Sunset Towers? Who was Sam Westing, really? Why were these heirs chosen over all the other people in Sam Westing's long life? But most importantly, what is the answer to the riddle of Sam Westing's will, that will bring with it a multi-million dollar prize? And who will be the heir to discover the answer? Once all the clues are in, the reader will begin to suspect a solution-- but could it really be that easy? Think twice. This book is the very definition of page turner. <br />  <br /> I could go on and on about this book, but to keep this review in its required bounds, I'm just going to say one last thing: &quot;Read it!&quot;	2004-07-30
US	51101066	R15QIKX29XYVH7	0066212855	817493742	Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Flawed, but Overall, Very Good	It still captures the imagination after 120 years: the volcano Krakatoa erupted, killing more than 36,000 people. The resulting volcanic ash caused a frightening drop in temperatures all around the world. That wasn't all: it also caused tidal waves that nearly drowned Java and Sumatra, and produced a sonic boom that was heard for a 3,000 mile radius. It even colored global sun rises and sun sets. Such a catastrophe not of human making is comparable to some of the calamities that caused massive, worldwide extinctions.<br />If there is one fault to this fascinating report, it is in not concentrating on the vision of the actual eruption of the volcano. Simon Winchester has access to transcripts of  eye-witness accounts, as well as the global journalist coverage, so his account is vivid, yet seems somewhat anti-climactic. I was a little disappointed. This should have been the culmination of the horror and emotion described previously in such length (and eloquence), but the story somehow fails to peak, and instead, just crumbles a little and slips away. Having access to diaries of people who ran for the hills, and barely escaped with their lives, Winchester should, one would think, find a truly dramatic and stirring denouement well within his reach. Many people ran and endured horrors, yet were still in the end, overcome by the continued fallout, and there is little of this kind of sustained terror described. <br />Winchester has an engaging narrative voice, all the same, and the less graphic parts of the book, the political analysis, for example, are reported with a lucidity that keeps the reader engaged. The end of the book, Winchester's personal account of his visit to the area, and his view of current volcanic activity in this place is excellent. <br />For the reader who is not previously acquainted with the event of 1883, this isn't a bad introductory text. Maps and sketches abound, emphasizing the small area of ground zero that resulted it such a global disaster. In addition, since this book may inspire enough interest to spur readers to seek even more in other stories of this episode in history, it is well worth reading.	2003-11-28

I meant that philosophically, they are still living in the days of the flower children.<br />Perhaps I am being unfair, since this book is now two decades old-- albeit, it was published two decades after Woodstock.<br />The methods the Kaufmans used are recognized therapies now. Some of them existed at the time Raun was a toddler, though they were considered radical. They are now conventional. In a sense, the Kaufmans reinvented the wheel, because instead of intuiting their therapy processes, they could have found them in a book called The Me Book, a book published around the time, or just before, Raun was born.<br />My point in saying that the Kaufmans are behind the times is that they still believe that their therapy is some kind of love-in, and that is why it works. Back when The Me Book was written, no one had any idea why the therapies worked. Now we do. We know from PET scans and MRI's, from lifelong studies by dedicated doctors and psychologists, why these methods work, and it is NOT because the therapist loves the child.<br />The Kaufmans \\"love conquers all\\" attitude is bound to make some parents feel inadequate, because the converse is that parents whose children do not improve are not loving enough. If love were the solution, there would not be any autistic children.<br />Now if Kaufman believes that the mechanism is that parental loves drives the effort required to continue the intensive therapy day after day, then he is right. But I don't think this is what he means. I believe Kaufman actually thinks that this therapy is an expression of love. It may be, among other things, but love is not the reason this therapy works.	2003-11-09

And the whole time, I was scared out of my wits. I have never read anything more frightening. I hated to go home alone in spite of my big black dog who provides unrelenting protection. So be warned: if you scare easily, or are the nervous type, this book may be to powerful for you; on the other hand, if you are searching for the fright of your life, you have found it in this book.<br />Several people are gathered in old Hill House, chosen for an experiment in ghost-hunting because each has experienced psychic phenomena before. Do these people bring out the ghosts and demons of Hill House? Are these just suggestible people given to delusions? Read closely to find out.	2003-10-21

The reader is sucked into this book by Sylvia Plath's exquisite narrative voice: her similies are still startling even after so many years, her word choices are flawless, and she is a master at choosing just the right details-- and nothing more to bog down the narrative flow-- that illuminate a scene.<br />The plot has a true ring to me. I suspect that most people who have made it through most of a college program, and must confront the courses and people which they have managed to avoid for many semesters; that, or not finish their program, would feel the same way. I don't think a person must be depressive in order to relate to the malaise of the beginning of the book. By the time things become, well...strange, the reader has already been pulled into Esther's head, and sees events from her perspective. Her depression seems almost inevitable.<br />Beautiful and perfect.	2003-10-08

Still, if you plan to read the series (and you should), you must read this for background.<br />There are many things to recommend this book, however: Baum has a captivating writing style, which is intended for children, but does not talk down to them. The style isn't cloying, as it is in many children's books of the time. Adults will enjoy it as well; in fact, if you are an adult who has not read this or the other Oz books, you should do so.<br />One of the best features of the book is the pluck, and resourcefulness of the main character. Dorothy is a true hero who never lets her predicament get her down. She always keeps her goal in sight. She is a wonderful role model for girls, and a female character to whom boys can easily relate.<br />If I could give it more than five stars, I would.<br />(and don't forget the sequels)	2003-09-17

However, in his two books on the subject (the one under review being the second) he has disseminated plenty of misinformation.<br />Graysmith's theory of the Zodiac killings is that they were committed by a man named Arthur Leigh Allen. Most of the book is a smear campaign against Allen. Graysmith reiterates his accusation, and then says it yet again, as though wishing would make it so.<br />Unfortunately, not only does Allen not match any witness descriptions of the Zodiac, but Graysmith's main argument is hardly substantive. Graysmith states that a man who knew Allen one heard him say that he would \\"like to hunt people,\\" because \\"Man is the most dangerous game,\\" he continues, \\"I'd call myself `Zodiac.'\\" This is a \\"friend-of-a-friend\\" story which sounds suspiciously like an Urban Legend.<br />This book purports to contain \\"the complete text\\" of the Zodiac letters \\"reprinted completely here for the first time.\\" It doesn't. This is easy to demonstrate, because there is text in his first book that does not appear in this book. In another place, he claims to have solved one of the Zodiac's unsolved enciphered letters-- FBI cryptographers have rejected his solution, however, a detail he omits. Graysmith further describes a road that the Zodiac must have taken to escape the scene of the murders. He claims to have driven the road himself. No map of the time shows this road, and there is no trace of the road now. Several people have attempted to drive this road, and have not found it, nor the remnants of a closed road. <br />Graysmith employs a lot of specious, negative evidence as well. He states that because the Zodiac was not demonstrably out of town or incapacitated during any one of the murders, he must have been present at the crime scenes.<br />Moreover, the writing style of the book is rambling and unfocused-- something like \\"stream of consciousness\\" writing that writersof fiction use. His writing was much tighter and clearer in the first book, leaving one to wonder whether he perhaps had help with the first book, or otherwise rushed the second book to publication. Rushed in a way that shows contempt for the reader, and suggests Graysmith was in a hurry to collect royalties.<br />Skip this one; there are other books on the Zodiac not written by Graysmith, such as &quot;This Is the Zodiac Speaking\\" : Into the Mind of a Serial Killer by Michael D. Kelleher, and Sleep My Little Dead: The True Story of the Zodiac Killer by Kieran Crowley; try those instead.	2003-09-17

Gilovich covers everything from the counter-intuitiveness of many facts governing probability, to the effects of absent data, to debunking often reported stories of older research, such as the case of \\"Little Albert,\\" a toddler who was made to be afraid of white rats, by pairing any contact with white rats with an unpleasant stimulus.<br />Gilovich has personally conducted numerous research trials exploring the ways people learn and reason, and draws on this background, as well as a thorough command of other research into relevant areas. In one experiment, students were asked to guess their class rankings in regard to leadership abilities: only 2% thought they were below average, while a full 60% thought they were in the top 10%!<br />Gilovich has a very smooth writing style, and he is writing here for laymen. In spite of the huge amount of valuable information presented, the 215 page book is easy-going, and I think most people would finish it in a few days.<br />This is a book you will refer back to time and again, so buying a personal copy is a good idea.	2003-09-17

Maybe poor Ms. Cornwell is so used to writing fiction, that not being able to control the facts of her case, to write what she wanted, and tie up the neat ending she'd decided on when she typed \\"Chapter 1\\" into her computer made her crack.<br />Certainly I wasn't shocked by the long, long passages on watermarks; I wasn't even shocked by the no-holds-barred descriptions of the disgusting life suffered by people living in the East End of Victorian London-- which incidentally I thought were the best part of the book. Few books on Jack the Ripper are so honest about the misery that drove Jack's victims to the desperation of street prostitution.<br />What I was shocked by were occasions of outright dishonesty from a writer I had once admired.<br />To begin with, Cornwell never lets on that Sickert has been connected with the Ripper murders before. In 1990 a woman named Jean Overton Fuller wrote a book called Sickert and the Ripper Crimes. Fuller, like Cornwell, detects shadows of the Rippers victims in many of Sickert's paintings, and like Cornwell, assumes that he must have committed the murders, not seen photographs of the bodies, or illustrations in the papers.<br />Also, as far back as 1947, Sir Osbert Sitwell wrote that Sickert persistently spoke of knowing the identity of Jack the Ripper, because he once rented a room, which he landlady told him she had previously rented to a veterinary student who was Jack the Ripper. Apparently the landlady regaled Sickert with stories of the student's comings and goings, and Sickert loved to listen.<br />More damning though, she states things such as this, on page 33: \\"With rare exceptions they [the Ripper's victims] were in their late thirties or early forties.\\" The Ripper had five victims, according to the police at the time, four of whom were in their forties, and one of whom was twenty-five. Cornwell writes the word \\"exceptions\\" as plural, because she has added to the total murders outside the accepted provenance of Jack the Ripper, that she alone believes Sickert committed.<br />Then on page 121, she states \\"if Sickert had seen [victim] Mary Ann at the mortuary, her eyes would have been shut by then, just as they are in her photograph.\\" I couldn't believe it. I flipped through the illustrations in the book wondering whether I could trust my memory. Cornwell had included a copy of Mary Ann Nichols' mortuary photograph, but it is so vague, I could barely discern a face. The eyes were two black lines, and I could not fairly judge whether they were open or closed. I picked up a book ten years older than Cornwell's book, The Jack the Ripper A-Z. This book also includes Nichols' mortuary photo, and it is the same photo, with a half-circle tear on the right side. In the much clearer print of the photo in A-Z, Nichols' eyes are CLEARLY OPEN.<br />Cornwell lied. She lied, to make a point; a point that Sickert once made a sketch of a woman resembling Nichols as she lay dead, but with eyes open. Cornwell claimed Sickert must have seen Nichols dead before the mortuary worker closed her eyes, as though Sickert were incapable of imagining her with open eyes. Then she published a deliberately vague photo in order to cover up the fact that Sickert may well have seen a photo of Nichols with her eyes open.<br />I would not go on like this if it were one instance in a nearly 400 page book, but it's not. When Cornwell is not outrightly insulting the reader by condescendingly introducing background information as though the reader grew up in a hothouse, then she is slyly insulting by assuming the reader cannot question or double-check anything she says.<br />And it may simply be that as a fiction writer she is too accustomed to writing in a vacuum, where the reader must accept everything she says. Maybe she intends no malice, and is just lousy at non-fiction, and should go back to novels, which she does well.<br />I hope, I hope.<br />I hope not, as another reviewer said, that this is all because she owns many Sickert paintings, which would go up in value if people believed he were Jack the Ripper.	2003-04-07

As such, Murray didn't have to worry about style or form. Neither did his editors. Murray does try though, I suspect; at any rate, something is going on. Every verb seems to have been run through his word processor's thesaurus, and I wonder if this might be his idea of finely crafted writing. Rather than a winning narrative voice, however, in the end the book rings with the voice of someone who is not a native speaker of English.<br />If it were not for that complaint, I probably would have given the book three stars.<br />Murray doesn't so much document his life as he vomits it all over the pages. This is a man who hates his mother, and who seems to think solace will come from his readers hating her too. If that seems cruel beyond measure, I'm willing to mitigate it by Murray's enormous naiveté. Right on page one he writes <br />&quot;Mine was not the typical American family, where a dad and a mom and the kids cuddled up on the couch with hot chocolate and popcorn to watch &quot;Father Knows Best.&quot; (sic) At my house we argued about the value of the American way, whether or not the workers should revolt....&quot;<br />If he really believes ANY family was or is like that, then he is sadly misinformed, or just not very bright. My family never cuddled on the couch, and we did discuss the value of the American way, albeit without throwing dishes, as the Murrays did. We also light Hanukkah candles, and pass the charoset at Passover, and I am quite grateful to William Murray's mother that in my generation, Jewish children did not recite the Lord's prayer in public school, as our parents had done.<br />Murray's story may be the study of an abusive childhood, but nowhere does he prove his thesis: he never succeeds in connecting O'Hair's atheism with her poor parenting skills. For this reason, and the bad writing, I consider this a less-than-good book.<br />However, this is still a book worth reading. Several chapters are devoted to biographical information about O'Hair. I learned all sorts of things about her I never knew, including things that suggest how she formed her values and opinions. The fact that her father used her when she was a very small child, to assist in his bootlegging, taught her the inconsistency of his values, and also how the fanaticism of a small group could oppress a larger group with normally formed ideas.<br />I recommend this book to people who want to know more about the Murrays, and O'Hair herself (&quot;fans&quot; will be upset, though). I DON'T recommend it to Christian apologists looking for ways to argue with atheists, because Murray's didacticism is just too weak.	2001-12-17

As terrible as Apartheid is and was, a few individual stories should not get lost in the shuffle: among them are The Story of an African Farm, The Flame Trees of Thika, and The Land of Green Ginger.<br />Joanna is a young woman of English heritage, born in Africa, against whom circumstances conspire to deliver back to England. But Africa, and specifically the land of green ginger is forever with her, and she never quite fits into slow-paced English society. She has an adventuresome spirit that her purely English provincial neighbors perceive as not quite ladylike.<br />In the beginning, when Joanna is young, she is unaware of how she comes across, and the beauty of Holtby's writing is her ability to communicate the charm and spirit of Joanna to the reader so that the reader finds her appealing, and at the same time, with the same actions, show her time after time committing minor faux pas that make the neighbors wary of her.<br />Eventually, Joanna realizes just how much she doesn't fit in, and she longs more and more for Africa. She has married a man who shared her longing for something outside of provincial England, but was struck with tuberculosis. She has had two children, and because of her husband's illness, bares almost sole responsibilty for them. By this time we have come to love Joanna, and are rapt, hoping with her to find some way out of the English fog into the African sun, and a happier life for her children. Each step toward or back from Africa is an emotional jolt for the reader, and the end is a long sigh; as we close the book-- or at least as I did, a whispered &quot;Amen.&quot;	2001-12-13

He can't write a book called Nine Questions People Ask about Judaism. No, he has to write, THE Nine Questions People Ask about Judaism. But this is typical Prager. His questions are just the topics upon which he wants to pontificate. On most questions, he could state his positions quite succinctly, but he prefers to belabor each point with the gleanings of his thesaurus.<br />The questions themselves don't mine any new territory of Judaic thought, nor pull new wisdom from old problems. As far as I was concerned, questions two and six are self-evident-- they're not really questions. Question eight, whether or not to intermarry, is certainly a question, but because Prager confines the argument to Judaism's tenet of &quot;universal brotherhood,&quot; the question becomes some sort of logical fallacy.<br />To argue this question in terms of &quot;universal brotherhood&quot; only is to fall through the sand before the first sentence is out of your mouth. Serious debaters can pursue this question for days with powerful and substantial arguments on both sides that have nothing to do with some sort of ideal of &quot;universal brotherhood.&quot;<br />Prager also asserts, with no support, that most people form their religious belief at a young age, and never examine them again as long as they don't become rabbis. Further, his question seven accepts without examination the much believed, but as far as I know unproved, &quot;fact&quot; that young people feel alienated from Judaism.<br />I read this book as a young Jew, a young Jew who read Torah on a regular basis, had been active in Hillel, observed ALL the holidays, and shomer Shabbes. I really resented his broad generalizations about young people.<br />But that's Dennis Prager. I haven't read anyone who takes himself more seriously since Rabbi Shammai. His narrative voice is so pompous, I keep waiting for him to declare himself infallible.<br />What's more, Prager has an agenda. I've read others of his works, and he has a very conservative political agenda, with some odd quirks, that he had tried other times to link with Judaism. I see him doing it here again. When he poses, then answers, these particular questions, he pretends to speak for Judaism (Judaism reified). I don't agree with him, and I resent what he is trying to do.<br />If he would be honest about his agenda, and then try to demonstrate that the Torah or the nava'im offer him proof text, that might be different, but what he is doing here is dishonest, and since this book is marketed as an introduction to Judaism, I think it's a poor show.	2001-12-12

Hernandez are beyond description; I wish that the words brilliant, dazzling, ingenious, eminent, extraordinary, remarkable, and phenomenal, were fresh off the wordsmith's tongs, but as it is, they're simply too tarnished to gleam brightly enough for Gilbert and Jaime Hernandez.<br />Through Love and Rockets the Bros. have done for the graphic novel what Shakespeare did for the sonnet or Dorothy Parker did for the short story.<br />Now I'll confess my personal taste: I love Hopey and Maggie. I even have a cat named Hopey. In high school and college, I used to live for each new episode of Locas. Hopey and Maggie are two women, barely out of their teens when the series begins-- though Maggie was already a master mechanic, best friends and occasional lovers, living in Hoppers, a fictional West Coast Hispanic town, where punk rock and big cars ruled, and if you were lucky, you older cousin might buy you beer.<br />Hopey and Maggie had the usual problems and heartbreaks of young people not destined for college; Maggie was the worker, who could fix anything, Hopey was the dreamer, playing in her band, and very occasionally even making a little money at it. (&quot;We want the world, and we want it-- BALD!&quot;) Also, once in awhile, Maggie went halfway around the world on a mission to a place where she rode hover scooters, and dinosaurs still existed.<br />The world of Las Locas (93 Million Miles from the Sun), was poetic, in its very personal way; the way graffiti is beautiful, and you wonder why mayors and city councils get into such a snit over it. Poetic like the grace of a master skateboarder. Found art, that not everyone can see.<br />But the Brothers Hernandez take all the poetics to be found that many people miss, and put it all in these pages, and hand you the glasses you need to see it clear as your own hands in front of you. And besides that, they're FUN! They're just plain fun, good old fun like you haven't had since high school. You can't sit still when you read Love and Rockets. You will smile and nod and laugh, and maybe even jump up and down a few times, and reach out to high five the characters who seem so real.<br />But back to Hopey and Maggie. This particular collection chronicles one of their adventures. There are others, but for the uninitiated, I think this is the best introduction to Hopey and Maggie. It's not as tragic as The Death of Speedy, but it still catches them young, and doesn't leave you puzzling over so much that has gone before.<br />Have this rush delivered. Do not deprive yourself of Love and Rockets any longer.	2001-12-10

I'm the sort of dedicated fan of Miles Franklin who doesn't mind the here and now of the first few chapters, but someone not so big a fan wouldn't be quite as interested in the point of view character's opinion of the minutiae that Franklin chronicles, before she gets right down to things. <br />For example, Franklin brings too many characters at once into the story, instead of holding them off until they become necessary to the plot. She has these characters so well developed in her mind, that she can't resist sharing them in clever detail; the result, however, is confusing. I'm fond enough of simply reading what Franklin has to say, that I don't mind, but I suspect many people would give up in frustration.<br />Maybe the reader could skim the first chapter for proper names and highlight them, then go back for quick reference when the characters become part of the story.<br />The story itself is brilliant: the vote has come to women in Australia, and in the small town of Noonoon, the two male candidates have posited themselves, one as the &quot;women's&quot; candidate, and the other as the &quot;men's.&quot; The women's candidate spends his campaign shamelessly flirting, while the men's candidate grunts, stomps around, chops a lot of wood, and questions the masculinity of his opponent.<br />Dawn, the title character, is a beautiful young woman, the granddaughter of the narrator's landlady, with whom the narrator is quite taken. The narrator is a woman, and her attraction to Dawn is intense. It is never labeled as sexual attraction, and the narrator never makes any overtures that could be interpreted as such. What she does, however, is orchestrate a meeting between Dawn, and a young man of her acquaintance, who is very like herself, and whom she is absolutely convinced is the only man for Dawn, so by proxy, she in a sense, seducesDawn.<br />So all the while the narrator is endlessly amusing herself over the silliness of the local election, and sharing her disdain with Dawn, whom she considers superior to the &quot;everyday folk&quot; that populate Noonoon, she is herself engaging in her own silly subterfuge, and blithely unaware of the self-serving motive behind her orchestrations.<br />Miles Franklin was just twenty when she wrote this book, but has remarkable insight into the mind of a middle-aged woman. She is also already a master of the type of prose that keeps you giggling as you read. Even though Franklin has presented the narrator as lacking in personal insight, she still has lent the narrator her own gift for the amusing quip. Every description is perfectly apt and perfectly amusing.<br />If you're looking for something to read that's out of the ordinary, without being out of this world, you'll find it here. I recommend this book, and anything by Miles Franklin.	2001-12-09

When she was sixteen years old, Miles Franklin wrote My Brilliant Career, A NOVEL, but was plagued for years by people who believed that this book was an autobiography. Some people continued to insist it was, or even misrepresent it as such even after being personally informed by Miles Franklin that the book was a novel. Finally, Miles Franklin withdrew My Brilliant Career from publication, and in the fifties, wrote My Career Goes Bung as a response to those who continued to believe that My Brilliant Career was an autobiography. My Career Goes Bung is a parody of the literary world, not a sequel to My Brilliant Career, and frankly, if you read it immediately after, it will probably spoil the magic of My Brilliant Career for you.<br />That said, here is my review of My Brilliant Career:<br />The is a beautiful and startling book. Written by Miles Franklin in 1901, when she was just sixteen, it is the story of a young girl, Sybylla Melvyn, trying to live her own life in Possum Gully, Australia. She doesn't want to marry, and repeat her mother's life. She'd like to travel, but she has no money. She's bright, but her prospects for college are non-existent. More than anything, she would like to be an artist, but not because she has a passion for any particular artistic expression; she just likes her imagined idea of an artist's lifestyle.<br />She has a brief respite when she goes to live with her grandmother, and meets Harold Beecham, who becomes her best friend. She also gets to know her Aunt Helen, &quot;neither maid, nor widow, nor wife,&quot; who cautions her of the dangers of marrying for love. Sybylla wonders why she should marry at all. If she had a fortune, she declares, she would give it gladly to someone she loved, but &quot;the word wife finished [her] up.&quot;<br />Life has tougher things in store for Sybylla, but she is a survivor, and she begins to write. She masters metaphor: &quot;If the souls of our lives were voiced in music, there are some that none but a great organ could express, others the clash of a full orchestra, a few...the...exquisite sadness of a violin..., and mine could be told with a couple of nails in a rusty tin pot.&quot;<br />Maybe she writes because of what she knows, or maybe she has insight because she writes, but Sybylla, from Possum Gully, to genteel Caddagat and Five-Bob Downs, to the muddy M'Swat farm, and back to Possum Gully, knows classism, demagoguery, democracy, socialism, feminism, and cynicism.<br />Sybylla is a joy to know. I can't recommend this book more.	2001-12-09

I'm quite grateful to Sheva Zucker for writing a new text on Yiddish, since the others that are still in print are dated, and don't seem to have been especially relevant to begin with.<br />The vocabulary introduced in the very first lesson is relevant and usable, which is unfortunately high praise for a language text. I don't know why, but language text writers think you need to know how to say things like &quot;Is it customary to tip the wine steward?&quot; or &quot;May I accompany you on the harpsichord?&quot; and it is not until the very last chapter that you learn the verb &quot;to be.&quot; <br />Similar praise for her vocabulary lessons; in addition to covering useful topics, they are lively, and just right: not too much, not too little, and they never become drudgery.<br />I'll admit that I was a step ahead on the vocabulary, because my Hebrew is good, so I knew the loan words; howsoever, by the third chapter, I was eavesdropping on the older members of my congregation, and by the time I'd finished the book, I was helping them with their subjunctive verbs. All right, I'm kidding about the last one, but before I'd finished the book, I was already making conversation.<br />You'll probably find, as I did, that people are ready to talk with you, and put up with imperfect Yiddish as you improve, because they love to see more people learning the language. This makes the concept of a self-teaching text viable, so don't let the idea scare you. If you are regularly involved in a community with some Yiddish speakers, then this self-teaching text will speed by.<br />Heck, I even wrote Sheva Zucker a thank you note.	2001-12-08
US	51101066	RFZKJ5KB78WNI	0618040196	513328313	The Seven Sins of Memory: How the Mind Forgets and Remembers	Books	5	44	45	N	N	Venial Sins	Even if this hadn't been quite such a good book as it is, I would have given it five stars for being neither about analogy nor pathology. I am tired of both, because as much as it is handy to refer to computer data storage as &quot;memory,&quot; it really is nothing like human memory, and as much as my mother sees ghouls of Alzheimer's over every lost pen, the truth is that her memory isn't as good as, well, as she remembers it being.<br />Without being about pathology, this book is about the fallibility of memory; or rather I should say, the failure of memory to live up to the expectations that we have for it. Actually, this book has made me think about the purpose and function of memory, and I've concluded that it actually works rather well; if we had little videocameras in our frontal lobes, they wouldn't serve us as well as the memory functions we actually have, and in fact, this is the subject of the final chapter.<br />The seven &quot;sins&quot; of memory are transience, absent-mindedness, blocking, misattribution, suggestibility, bias and persistence. <br />Transience is the deterioration of memory over time, other than traumatic memory-- Persistence is the stubbornness of traumatic memory to fade. Absent-mindedness is failure to pay attention to something unusual that happens while performing a task by rote. Misattribution is attributing one feature of a memory to another-- remembering a childhood friend by his dog's name, for example. Blocking is the &quot;tip of the tongue&quot; phenomenon. Bias is coloring old memories with present knowledge.<br />There is no branch of study, from cranial anatomy, to neurochemistry, to performance psychology, to forensics, that he does not probe for usefulness. I applaud him for undertaking this project. In general, his writing is clear and concise. If occasionally he seems to belabor a point, this is something his editors should have corrected, and I don't take him to task for it. Skim through and go on.	2001-12-07
US	51101066	R2ERTNTNWEDFUM	0931055512	892469755	Womanpriest: A Personal Odyssey	Books	5	9	10	N	N	The Philadelphia Eleven	Alla Bozarth-Campbell was one of the first women to be ordained priest in the Episcopal church. She was one of Philadelphia eleven: eleven women deacons ordained &quot;underground&quot; by a retired bishop of the church, the canons of which declare &quot;a priest is a priest forever.&quot; <br />The Church National Conference laity had several times voted to accept women as priests, but the bishops continually blocked the ordinations by very slim minorities. Young male candidates for ordination were &quot;striking,&quot; refusing ordination, until the Church at large allowed women priests. These eleven women pushed the matter from hypothesis into reality, and forced the Church to deal with it.<br />To be one of these eleven required courage, and faith, but also a sureness of vocation. How Bozarth-Campbell came to have these qualities makes a remarkable biography. <br />Bozarth-Campbell is a gentle writer: she is neither a braggart, nor cloyingly modest. Her writing suggests that she is soft-spoken, but nonetheless certain of herself. She is also never at a loss for just the right word; altogether, this story is gripping. Even though we know how things turn out, there is suspense; we don't know the details, and I, myself was on the edge of my chair waiting for them.<br />Anyone interested in women's spirituality, or church history must read this book; people who enjoy biography in general will not be disappointed either. And those who just enjoy good writing should like this book.	2001-12-06

The story is of the Spradley family, and daughter Lynn, who is one of many children born Deaf in the US in the late sixties and early seventies, the result of an epidemic of Rubella (German Measles).<br />At the time Lynn's deafness was diagnosed, the common wisdom among hearing professionals was that children born deaf should not be exposed to any kind of sign language, and instead should receive intensive tutoring, even as infants, in speaking and speechreading. Although the tide would turn soon, the Spradleys had no way of anticipating that; they embarked on an odyssey of trying to teach Lynn to speak, and with a hearing aid, and by watching intently, to appear to listen as a hearing child.<br />After many years of pouring words into Lynn, with the promise from the experts that one day Lynn would finally pour the words back out, the Spradleys are frustrated with not being able to talk to their daughter. Lynn is several years old, and becoming a discipline problem.<br />Then one day, the Spradleys meet a five year old, signing Deaf child, a child who not only communicates with her parents, but makes jokes. The Spradleys are forced to reconsider years of expert advice balanced against one little girl who can talk to her parents, where their daughter cannot.<br />How the Spradleys learn to stand on their own, and disregard the experts, even in the face of some heavy censure, is the story of heroism. This is a book to own, because you will want to return to it again and again.	2001-12-05

I can't really tell exactly what has been added to this edition, except to acknowledge that it is longer. The beauty of the first book was that after you looked up whatever you needed to look up, you couldn't put it down. The book still has the same effect, but with a more compelling sense that you really ought to put it down because you have something better to do. I suspect that what has been added is mere &quot;filler&quot;: stuff to puff the book up so that people won't mind paying more for it.<br />Nonetheless, this still is the best manual of form to have. It is so remarkably clear, that a textbook review committee would probably wonder whether some mistake had been made. Simply look up the punctuation mark in question in the clearly labeled table of contents, and your question will be answered in no time. Better yet, reserve a Sunday afternoon to read the book cover to cover, and never have a punctuation question again.<br />Yes, I did say read it cover to cover. Ms. Gordon has done for manuals of grammar what Dorothy Parker did for book reviews, or Judith Martin does for etiquette. This is quite an enjoyable romp with cross-eyed scholar-poets, that prima donna [Too-Too LaBlanca], and Torquil and Jonquil, (who will accompany you to the spa on Epiphany, if you accompany them to Ornette Coleman's recital afterwards [sic]).<br />So I must admit, even though I don't think the second edition is any improvement over the first, I still think this book is miles beyond any other of its kind. You may wish to have a more complete manual of style, as this book covers punctuation only, but you will still benefit from having this book. A complete manual of style will devote only a few pages to punctuation, and give few examples; its instructions will never be clear. With The Well-Tempered Sentence by your side, however, you will never punctuate incorrectly again.	2001-12-03
US	51101066	R3CO5VJZZQF9ZI	1859849296	181218559	The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice	Books	5	539	590	N	N	Triple Entendre	In swift and sly prose, Hitchens relates his personal observations of Mother Teresa's clinics in Calcutta. He tells one story of a nursery full of starving, sick babies crying in insufficient cribs, which M. Teresa describes as the way &quot;we fight abortion.&quot; He writes of men dying of AIDS, denied pain medicine, because according to M. Teresa, their suffering will assure them of ultimate salvation. Paitients too weak to object are baptized in their final hours.<br />I have now doubt that all of this is true, and at first glance it is surprising, but it shouldn't be. M. Teresa is a Roman Catholic nun and Mother Superior; in fact, founder of an order. She is not merely Christian in a vague way, but a zealot for Catholicism. I knew this-- in fact I even knew that at one point, all she allowed her nuns was an impoverished diet of rice, and insufficient calories of that, because she thought they should the same thing as the people they served. This was not necessary, as her order had plenty of money. She began feeding her nuns a living diet only after the Pope ordered her to do so.<br />I suppose as a Catholic nun and zealot, she's did a fine job, but I don't think most Americans, especially non-Catholic Americans, knew this. Every year, millions of dollars are donated to her order, most of which sits in banks, while patients in her hospitals suffer from insufficient care. Some of this money comes from non-Catholic Americans who know next to nothing about M. Teresa and her actual mission. All people know is some vague idea that there's a lot of hunger and inadequate medical care in Calcutta, and M. Teresa order is doing something out there to help.<br />Christopher Hitchens lets people know exactly what she did; anyone who reads this book will never blindly donate money on the assumption that since there's poverty in Calcutta, any money sent to charity workers there must be doing some good.<br />More than exposing her clinics, Hitchens shows the disingenuous way M. Teresa has presented herself to the world. There is here in the book reprinted a very quaintly written letter on behalf of Charles Keating(!) reprinted here, yet plenty examples of her savvy that belie the innocent charm of her letter.<br />Hitchens does not hide his distaste for his subject, and while it is easy to accuse him of less than objectivity, he does stick to the facts; he just reports them with biting, venomous words. If you are a fan of M. Teresa, this book will offend you. If you seek the truth about her, you must read this book. If you have always harbored doubts about her, but never had any real evidence, this book will be a great relief, as your gut feeling is confirmed.	2001-12-02

The filler is written so poorly, it brings to mind high school essays that must be of a certain length, so they consist mostly of the same sentence written over and over, with slight word changes each time. Oh, and on page 14? It should be &quot;one FEWER idiot.&quot; Just shows what kind of editing was going on over at Dutton.<br />Not to mention the fact that quite a lot of Urban Legends slipped by Northcutt and her editors. I realize she takes her information from newspapers, but newspapers make mistakes, and I was able to check on the Urban Legend status of suspicious stories by simply running key words through snopes website, sitting right here at my computer, so how hard would it have been for Northcutt to have done the same? I mean really, if she's writing for national publication?<br />That said, the whole concept of the Darwin Award is one of the great comedic efforts of our time. Not only that, it's found comedy, the best kind. Once I recovered from nit-picking, and got down to enjoying the book, I had a great time. This stuff is so funny, it can make the most intent cynic, or the most determined curmudgeon laugh. Yeah, we're laughing at people's misfortune; get over it. It's funny when the guy trips on the banana peel. When is it funny that your brother got into Harvard, or your neighbor won the lottery?<br />At least we're laughing at a distance.

Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds has been a favorite of mine for years, so while I'm happy to see it popularized, there's so much I miss! This is the first book of Urban Legends. There's so much to the book, and so much is so funny, and the financial stuff is the driest part of the book.<br />That said, I understand Fridson has a theme, and by using these two old works, one Victorian, and one Louis XIV, he shows that nothing much changes: people will do very stupid things if that's what everyone else is doing. More to the point, people will do very risky things with their money, if everyone else is doing so. Examples abound in these two great books, and Fridson doesn't miss a chance to make a point, and usually gets a good laugh in as well.<br />Tulipomania (when the price of tulip bulbs in Holland inflated beyond the ridiculous) is especially revealing, and though Fridson is using it to make a point about price inflation, I couldn't help thinking also about the marketing technique by which the public is convinced it needs something, then that something is doled out like Oreos to a diabetic. I'm thinking specifically of diamonds, but there are lots of examples.<br />Fridson pulls this altogether, and as big a fan as I am of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, the original work he has created by mating a part of it with the other work, and with his own explanatory text is a great book.<br />I am not an investor, and generally find economics petrifyingly boring, but this book was a fun romp. Even if you have no interest in finance, read this book just to have a good laugh at our species.	2001-12-01

What The Onion prints is never reality, but sometimes it's truer than the front page of the New York Times.<br />I'm known in my circles as a sort of &quot;Mikey&quot; of humor, someone beyond curmudgeon. People tell jokes, and laugh, and say &quot;That's really funny, but let's see if Rivkah laughs.&quot;<br />Well, The Onion makes me laugh. Regularly, and outloud. It's beyond satire; I don't think there's a word for the humor in The Onion. There are probably people out there who don't find The Onion funny, but I don't want to know them. With article titles such as &quot;Species of Blue-Green Algae Announces IPO,&quot; &quot;Fun Toy Banned Because of Three Stupid Dead Kids,&quot; or &quot;Christ Announces Hiring of Associate Christ&quot; you just know it has to be hilarious, and absurd and yet so true. How these writers can pen this stuff day after day without going into seizures, I don't know.<br />I do know that reading The Onion keeps world events in perspective, a service I badly need. Thank goodness it will always be there, because we continue to provide the writers with so much fodder.<br />Yes, you may be able to read The Onion on-line, or if you are very lucky, pick up the actual paper, but still, buy this book.

Since SAT scores reflect the achievement of a self-selected group, because the SAT is not required, these scores aren't of much use in demonstrating the abilities of an entire senior class (not to mention the fact that juniors and seniors take it together, along with some sophomores as well). I learned the surprising fact that until 1994, yearly scores were still compared (with some adjustment, but nonetheless....) to a group of young men who had all gone to private schools, and who took the test in 1941.<br />Rothstein includes information about declining dropout rates since the 1930's, and how this effects achievement scores of a senior class; he looks at more legitimate means of comparing students, such as the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. He also looks at the correlation between income and SAT scores, and documents the fact that more students from lower income families have been taking the test in recent decades.<br />In the last chapters, Rothstein examines some of the other issues facing schools, such as bi-lingual education, and phonics vs. whole word methods of reading instruction.<br />Anyone in education, and anyone concerned about national student achievement should read this book.	2001-12-01

Some children improve so dramatically with this diet, and especially with this diet and the drug nystatin, that I encourage all curious parents to try it. However, don't invest all your hopes in it, or stop other therapies, whether they be ABA, or anti-anxiety medications, when you try the diet.<br />Autistic behaviors as well as degree of expression fall across such a wide spectrum, that I have always believed no one single cause would ever be found. I believe however, that this diet, and the theory of casiomorphins, glutomorphins, and yeast overgrowth, is the answer to one type of autism.<br />This diet, and its history of discovery by persistent parents, is no less than another tale of Lorenzo's Oil.<br />The only drawback to this book is Lewis' personal story. She talks in such vague terms of her son's behaviors and &quot;improvements,&quot; that the reader has no picture of what is happening, and whether it's dramatic enough really to credit the diet.<br />However, the diet, the recipes, the resources are brilliantly presented. Everything a parent needs to start and maintain the diet is here. You won't find yourself, wondering, doubting, or second guessing, because the coverage of the actual diet is quite clear and complete. I wish there were some kind of Pulitzer for reference books, because I would nominate this one.	2001-12-01

He has to depend on his characters and his plotline to carry the novel along. He can't afford to stop and linger on a subject, because his prose style won't allow him to do so; the reader would skim down the page to the next &quot;interesting&quot; part.<br />His characters, unfortunately, are almost as flat as his prose. The title character is fleshed out, but she is a &quot;type.&quot; That may not be a fair criticism though, because Levenkron wrote this book to get the word out about Anorexia Nervosa, not to win a Pulitzer. And of course, Levenkron, in this book, contributed to creating the type, so I'll give credit where it's due.<br />Since the author's intent is to describe a girl progressing through Anorexia Nervosa, and in excruciating detail, the book is a resounding success, and frankly, I couldn't put it down. Levenkron chooses multiple points of view, so we hear the Anorexic girl, Kessa's, inner thoughts; we also have counterpoint from another girl who watches Kessa's disease progress. If this had been an actual biography, I would have felt intrusive, so Levenkron serves in creating what is no doubt a composite character; we learn the inner workings of this disease without having to intrude on anyone.<br />Now that Anorexia has been the Lifetime channel Disease of the Week, the perennial guest on Oprah, and the subject of more magazine articles than there are grains in a handful of sand, the book seems delicate. Still, it has its place; we can learn about Anorexia without having our eyes transfixed on the skeletal sufferer, so distracting that we barely hear her words. <BR>An interesting note: this book is a favorite among young Anorexic girls. I don't know what that means, other than that it attests to the accuracy of Levenkron's portrait of Kessa. I don't think the book causesAnorexia, because the girls who flock to it seem already to be Anorectics. But I suppose they are the best to judge, and if they are able to identify with the book, then Levenkron must have done something right.<br />If you are dealing with an Anorectic in your life, this book will give you a good idea of what goes on in her head.	2001-11-30

The book has a little cloud over it. The child Walker worries incessantly that people will think her parents are quaint or not worthy for their deafness or in other ways as well, because they're not socially aware and sophisticated. There seems always to be an unspoken feeling of loss.<br />Walker's family is deeply loving, but she grew up feeling a burden of the type that lower East side of Jewish grandmothers inflict. She was the oldest, she was her parents' interpreter. She was their conduit to the world outside their home; she was privy to things a child doesn't usually know about her family. She went to doctors' appointments with her mother, and introduced the family to new neighbors. But she bore up under this onus, smiling, never letting on that it bothered her. Until now. Or so she seems to suggest in the book. <br />I can't say how I would act under the same weight, however, Walker's mother says once that her oldest daughter &quot;takes things too hard.&quot; Walker seems by nature to be subdued, and just a little dour; at times she casts too much of her own personality into what she passes off as the general experience of children of Deaf parents. My experience of the Deaf community is that Deaf people are fun, energetic, full of humor and adventure. My view is my view. This just needs to be kept in mind; this book is one woman's biography, and not an unbiased sociological study of Deafness and family life.<br />What also isn't made clear is that times have changed. Walker was in college in 1973. Her parents were in the State Schools for the Deaf in the THIRTIES. Back then, students were not permitted to sign; they were expected to speak and lip-read only. Rarely taken off the school grounds for outings, Deaf children went home only for Christmas and the summer. Otherwise, they were at school, signing to one another whenever they were sure they were not being watched.<br />The Deaf parents now raising children watched Marlee Matlin win an Academy Award when they were in high school. When they were in college, at Gallaudet University, they took to the streets in an explosive protest to eject their school's president, and have a new, Deaf president appointed.<br />The book is a beautiful autobiography, and does capture some important moments in Deaf history. Read the book for its language, for its eloquent and unabashed descriptive passages. Read it for history. But don't expect to learn about the Deaf Community as it is today.	2001-11-29

Ruether is a well-known Christian theologian, whose original thinking has both spawned and solved great questions.<br />This book is a study of the phenomena behind anti-Semitism, but it is unlike any other study of this subject. The author traces the history of Jewish/Christian conflicts back much further than the early churches of Paul, where most authors begin. Ruether looks all the way back to the division of Christian Jews from other Jews over disputes in interpreting the Torah, and books of prophecy.<br />The study considers the social pressures of the early church to balance somehow the connection to Judaism, and the pressures from the burgeoning state of Rome, but she strips this question entirely of apologetics, demonstrating that deliberate choices were made, not out of desperation, but often for personal gain.<br />Reuther doesn't pull her punches. When there is blame to be laid, she lays it squarely on the head of the guilty party. But don't think that this is some kind of book of grudges. Ruether is an highly qualified historian and theologian who crosses all her t's and dots her i's. Before she makes any statements of guilt, she builds an extraordinarily strong case, that will have you sadly nodding your head.<br />Ruether writes with a light touch, never belaboring a point, so the book moves quickly; there is something fascinating on every page. This is a difficult book to put down. It's not often that such an academic subject is turned into a book read for pleasure, but Ruether has done so. Despite squirming sometimes just over the thought of the injustices inflicted on Jews, the joy of discovery ran deep, and I couldn't put this book down.	2001-11-29
US	51101066	RSP223XH8XMV8	0684831643	302682380	Unraveling the Mystery of Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorder: A Mother's Story of Research and Recovery	Books	5	15	15	N	Y	Autism Will Never Be the Same	As a QMRP and qualified Behavior Specialist, I have worked with autistic people for many years. I've always wondered why kids with autism get so many ear infections that nine out of ten seem to have ear tubes, and adult women are plagued by yeast infections. When I first entered this field, the stock answers were always that their hygiene was poor, or they couldn't tell us when they were just becoming sick, so we wouldn't find out until an infection was raging.<br />Those didn't seem like promising answers, but a lot of hygiene and &quot;tell us when it hurts&quot; therapy went in to trying to prevent infections, to no use.<br />So when Seroussi suggests in this book that intestinal yeast overgrowth can produce symptoms of autism, it made so much sense.<br />This is only one example of the groundbreaking information in this book.<br />This is not a book about therapy or habilitation; if you need a book to give you tips on teaching your child to bathe himself, or stay out of traffic, this book won't help. It's a completely different kind of book.<br />This book addresses causes of autism-- not genetic causes that can't be changed, but environmental, mostly dietary causes that can be changed. Seroussi details, day by day, the changes that came over her austistic son when dairy and gluten were removed from his diet. He still needed some therapy to catch up on what he had missed during his &quot;autistic days,&quot; but for the most part he became a typical little boy. <br />The process was much more cumbersome and complicated than my simple summary. Seruossi's son took certain medications that had never been used for autism before. He was subjected to numerous (necessary) tests. But in the end, he was no longer labeled autistic, or developmentally disabled at all.<br />Seroussi deserves numerous plaudits for her persistence and her own intelligence; what she managed for her son is no less than another Lorenzo's Oil.<br />She is also a good story-teller. Even people without a personal interest in autism would find this book fascinating.	2001-11-29

Books	5	7	10	N	N	Friedman Delivers	This fascinating book unfolds like a mystery novel, and like a really good &quot;whodunit,&quot; it is very hard to put down. Friedman sorts through everything that is known about the historicity of the Torah, adds some of his own deductions based on style and subject matter, and comes to a solid, well-supported conclusion.<br />This book lacks for nothing; any question that can be answered, is. Friedman knows his archeology, his Hebrew, his history, his commentary. The reader will be able to go back to the Torah with fresh understanding after reading this book, but more, the reader learns quite a lot about Jewish history.<br />I hesitate to say more, because I don't want to give anything away, so please just trust me; even is you have just a passing interest in the Bible, you will enjoy this book.	2001-11-29

It is very important to note that at no point does he say children should not be believed a priori, he only claims that current methods of interrogating children taint their testimony so the it is no longer useful.<br />Campbell would like nothing more than for this to change. He outlines his own method for interviewing children, and it is obvious that his technique would elicit far cleaner information than the usual methods.<br />Also suspect are claims of past abuse suffered as children, suddenly remembered by adults who claim to have &quot;repressed&quot; it.<br />That false memories can be created, he demonstrates by citing several objective studies, and I found them quite convincing. He further proves from objective studies that traumatic events are rarely forgotten. What's more, most of the case studies of &quot;recovered memory&quot; patients documented patients who had sought counseling for something other than lost time. In addition, many false memory patients recanted.<br />This is a much needed book. When people like Raymond Buckey spend five years in jail during a travesty of a trial, at the end of which he is acquitted, someone needs to stand up and cry &quot;Foul!&quot; I applaud Dr. Campbell for doing so.	2001-11-29

I'm going to try to separate my critique of the text as it is presented, and Maimonides work.<br />The typeface used here is awfully small, and crammed onto the pages with a crowbar, it seems. The margins must be measured with a micrometer. I suppose the publishers were determined to get the thing into one volume, but this book is really pretty slender; I don't see why it couldn't be larger to accommodate larger print, with more white space, so the words aren't crammed together like passengers in steerage.<br />The translation is dated, and takes some getting used to, if you haven't had a lot of exposure to late Victorian English, the language may be off-putting. I happen to have a degree in English literature, and have read many styles extensively, and barely notice how dated the language was. There are other translations, but Freidlander, in this translation is very cautious in keeping his words consistent. This is important, because a large part of Guide for the Perplexed is defining Biblical terms.<br />The Guide for the Perplexed is a brilliant work. Maimonides is my nomination for &quot;most important post-Talmudic scholar.&quot;<br />The Guide is not a simple work; Maimonides does not spell things out; he doesn't give succinct answers to ages old questions. One doesn't go to this book, look up &quot;Cain,&quot; and say, &quot;Ah, there's where he got his wife.&quot;<br />This is a book to aid the reader in becoming a better scholar. Where Maimonides does not give answers, he presents the tools that may assist the reader in studying the Torah, and coming up with his (or her!) own answers.<br />Words are defined, and also analyzed in an etymological way, which is really more mystical than scientific, but we're talking Torah.<br />Maimonides knows better than to give tools for interpretation without also giving lessons in interpretation. Some of his own mishnot come through as he discusses interpreting the Torah. He also discusses prophecy and free will, but eventually brings it all back to Torah.<br />Anyone who wants to be a serious Torah scholar needs this book.	2001-11-28

Donin's own aggadot and midrash on why these practices are important. In the end though, R. Donin is a believing Jew, and aggadot aside, he would say that any practice we do, we do because it's a mitzvah.<br />Though Donin writes from an orthodox perspective, he is very gentle with the reader, never insisting that his way is the only way. He doesn't dictate, he encourages the reader to try what feels comfortable, and to explore, and provides material enough for a long, long exploration. I can't think of a single question about daily practice or synagogue etiquette that couldn't be answered by referencing this book.<br />This book is intended for Jews, and as he states, particularly for Jews who grew up in a household where Yiddishkheit was not present. R. Donin assumes a certain amount of prior knowledge (such as understanding the Hebrew and Yiddish words I've used so far), so this is not a book for non-Jews with a casual interest in Judaism. However, anyone who has read one or two basic books on Judaism, or anyone who grew up Jewish, even if just barely observant should have no trouble with this book.<br />Donin's writing is more than just engaging, it projects a kindness that really must be experienced. It was as though Zayde were reading aloud to me. The book has heart. Never once do I think that R. Donin has written this book because he is casting for people to turn back to orthodoxy. I really believe he was motivated out of a pure love for Judaism, and this comes out of the pages.	2001-11-28

Mainstream feminism is carrying this message into the 21st century almost unchanged from the late 1960's. This type of book always leaves me feeling a little unsatisfied.<br />Kate Bornstein has written and book that attacks gender roles at the root, and not the flower. She is a male to female transsexual, in that she was identified as a boy at birth, and raised accordingly (there's a picture from her Bar Mitzvah), and was later surgically altered to look like a woman when she stands naked.<br />She has a woman's body, and a female name, and prefers the pronoun &quot;she,&quot; but Bornstein does not claim a gender in the way gender exists as a social construct. Few things are as personal as gender, and no one has a right to dictate another person's gender, or even that a person claim a gender. She talks about men, and women, and everyone in between. The &quot;everyone in between,&quot; however, are not sexless celibates nursing their melancholia in solitude; they are sexual beings like anyone else. <br />Bornstein, by dispensing with gender, opens up sexual possibilities that were previously unthought of. There's lots of sex in this book.<br />This book is not an apologetic for transsexualisn, or gender dysphoria. If anything, it is in your face regarding not only personal choices, but anyone who would dare to judge someone else's choices. This is not a plea for understanding, as books on transsexualism usually are, not a heart-breaking tale of emotional pain, rejection and confusion. Bornstein tells the truth of her story, and gives you the options of recognizing the truth for what it is, or continue living in a Fool's Paradise.<br />And in captivating narrative voice. Her style reflects her attitude, and you have no trouble hearing her in your head. This, to me, is the mark of a good author.	2001-11-28
US	51101066	RDAB0DCK6VANV	1573225126	662106244	Prozac Nation	Books	5	90	101	N	N	Gen-X Nation	Wurtzel's stated intent is to give the reader an idea of what it is like to be with someone who is depressed, and this is her justification for endless tales of her symptoms: yes, then I was in the hospital AGAIN, etc. Some readers find this grating, as though Wurtzel has made her point once, and please, could she move on to something else.<br />Personally, I found it interesting and revealing. No matter where she went, or what she was doing, or how much her friends cared about her, she still had those same old symptoms. That's clinical depression as opposed to someone who is in a difficult situation and therefore feeling lousy.<br />She needs to make this abundantly clear, because the final point, and the justification for her book's title, depends on the reader understanding the depth and breadth of her depression, and the etiology of it-- or lack of a clear cause, if that is a better way to put it. Wurtzel is not unhappy because her parents are divorcing, or because she was forced to go summer after summer to camps she hated, or because she disliked her afterschool program, or because high school was difficult for her academically (it wasn't). She's just depressed because there's something about Elizabeth Wurtzel that is bound to be depressed.<br />This leads into her late stated thesis: Prozac, and drugs like it are the Philosopher's Stone for people with this kind of ontological depression. But everyone seems to be taking something for the mildest and most transient of melancholias. Prozac has almost become a by-word for something doctors throw at hypochondriacs to make them go away.<br />So the same drug that saved Wurtzel's life was becoming something that cheapened her real disease, and caused people to whisper &quot;she really could just shake it off, but she's taking the easy way out.&quot;<br />Before Wurtzel brings Prozac into the story, she desperately wants to show the reader that if it were merely a question of shaking it off, there would be no book.<br />Personally, I found her narrative voice pleasantly engaging, but I will admit that it is distinctively marked by her generation, to which I also belong. Her words rang in my head like conversation with a good friend. Someone much older or younger might have difficulty engaging with the narrative. <br />This question of the narrative voice may date the book eventually, but then so will the whole subject of Prozac and its over or under prescription, so I don't think it is a criticism to observe that Wurtzel chose to use such a marked writing style.<br />Whether one has been through depression or not, this book is fascinating. It's a trip through a generation growing up, through Jewish camps and Hebrew school for those who remember them, and depression for those who want comfort in company, or those who want to know more. I would recommend it to anyone.	2001-11-27

He presents the text, restored as well as can be, with the layers in different typefaces, and gives the reader the whole of Q in its original.<br />His reconstructing is done by following the orders that quotations from the text appear in Matthew and Luke.<br />Once he has thoroughly familiarized the reader with Q, and with contemporaneous documents (the Dead Sea Scrolls, et al.), he discusses Q in a literary context: why it is what it is, a collection of sayings, and not the sort of historical biography we in the 21st century would like to have.<br />He also discusses society at the time, to put Jesus of Nazareth into a context as well, to explain why people who may not have considered him messiah might still have collected his sayings. The community of Q was probably Jewish, as nothing in Q contradicts any Jewish practice, and were probably not Christians as we understand this idea today.<br />If you have never read any literature about Christianity outside the Bible, this book will shake loose all your assumptions. But if you have read other books on very early Christianity, or the gospels as literature, or studied redaction in the gospels, and know of the Q document in theory, and the priority of Mark, there is nothing here that will alarm you.<br />However, there is much here to fascinate, to enjoy, to enthrall. Mack's picture of ancient Judah is skillfully drawn. The new information here (and there is lots) is firmly argued, and just makes sense. Many of your long held questions will be answered. <br />His writing is accessible; this book is written for readers, not for journal peer reviewers. Anyone with even a passing interest in the subject should be delighted with it.	2001-11-27

However, I have always given credit where it is due, and recognized that some of the very best photojournalism to be found is in the pages of Life. <br />As a New Yorker in body and soul, who is currently displaced, I started flipping through this book just to look at the change in the skyline without the World Trade Center Towers.<br />I was hooked. I had to look at every picture, and also read the text. The writers are all of one mind, which I suppose is the point of the book; the book doesn't quite challenge itself, though. Nonetheless, the writers come from many perspectives, and many places: Maya Angelou, James Bradley, Andrei Codrescu, Bob Greene, Melissa Fay Greene, Thomas Keneally, David McCullough, Gordon Parks, and Doug Stanton, to name some. Maya Angelou's piece was especially moving. I was pleased that the contributors weren't all of one political bent, because this tragedy belongs not just to the political coalition that can best exploit it.<br />The pictures are Life magazine in its finest moment. Life magazine contributors and editors excel in photodocumentation, and this is a shining example of their skills. The photos will both move you and fascinate you. Although this book does stir up the painful reality of what New York went through that day, I think New Yorkers will bear up under it, because this book makes what happened not just something that happened in New York, but something that happened in The United States of America.<br />And so the book earns its title.	2001-11-27

Books	3	8	11	N	N	Every Crackpot Has His Day	This is probably the best book in print on the question of the authorship of the Shakespeare plays. It is engrossing, readable, and the material is well organized and easy to follow, which is no small task in dealing with this subject.<br />The Shakespeare Claimants, a book from the 1960's on this subject, now out of print, is much better in my opinion, because its author is not afraid to comment on the relative rationality of the different theories. Author John Michell has chosen a different approach: Michell is equivocal in his treatment of the different theories of authorship. He therefore reports with a straight face such absurdities as the Baconian ciphers, and the idea that the Deptford police conspired with Christopher Marlowe to fake his murder.<br />In that his intent is to be neutral, he is extremely successful. And in all fairness, I'll note, that he does not give space to patent insanities, such as the theory that Queen Elizabeth I wrote the plays.<br />However, he does not, in my opinion, deal adequately with the issue of &quot;the secret that was not a secret.&quot; He mentions all the times that theorists use as evidence, incidents when William Shakespeare the actor is passed over for some sanction that befalls one of the theorists over the text of one of the plays. This is proof positive, say the theorists, that someone knew Shakespeare the actor was not Shakespeare the author; this demolishes earlier arguments of the theorists that Shakespeare was used as a cover because the real author could not be known as a playwright. While such situations come up time and again, Michell never ties them all together to make one great sweep at the idea of an authorship question in the first place.<br />Indeed, this is something else I found lacking in the book. There is no general discussion of the unliklihood that anyone but the actor wrote the plays with the name &quot;Shakespeare.&quot;<br />But Michell does add something to the picture that most of the theorists have lacked, and this admittedly does add strength to the question. This is a general knowledge of Elizabethan history, literature, and society. He is able to tame some of the wilder aspects of the theories with his superior knowledge.<br />If your interest is in Shakespeare, the actor, or in Shakespearean literature and criticism, you may want to throw this book against the wall after a couple of chapters. But if the Shakespeare Question intrigues you, or if crackpot conspiracy theories in general interest you, you'll love this book.	2001-11-26

I currently work with autistic teenagers in developing community living skills. I have also worked with adults who have grown up in institutions, and have an array of &quot;institutionalized&quot; behaviors. Thus they have become severely impaired in their daily function, when they might have been habilitated to live independently. No matter how many times I see these situations, each one breaks my heart.<br />So I have more than a passing interest in the subject of this book.<br />That parents could strap a child to a chair and provide her no social interaction for thirteen years, with no one knowing boggles the mind. The whole family is a tragedy.<br />Russ Rymer documents Genie's habilitation after she is discovered, and freed from this captivity. She is more than a tragedy to some people, because she is also a scientific curiosity; she presents an opportunity to study a person who, deprived of social contact past the &quot;critical point&quot; in language development, never develops language skills beyond the semantic level.<br />Everyone wants a piece of her. Linguists want her, social psychologists want her, developmental psychologists want her; each with a different agenda. As for Genie, it is difficult to fathom what she wants. In the immediate present, she has remarkable non-linguistic communicative skills which she seems to possess intuitively. But what are her hopes, her desires for a permanent living arrangement, an education, she can't communicate, or even correctly understand.<br />It's no good to assume that she would want what a normal child wants. She doesn't respond to affection, doesn't appear to discriminate between people and objects at first.<br />The story is heart-breaking and fascinating. Rymer's narrative voice is kind and full of compassion for Genie, and although the book is written in a typical third person academic style, sometimes I felt that the narrator was the only one on Genie's side.<br />When Rymer senses that readers may need background information, he departs from the story for an aside on linguistic theory, or the story of the Wild Boy of Aveyron. He dips into Montaigne, Locke, Descartes and Chomsky, but it is all relevant as Rymer reports it. We get the dirt on the nasty in-fighting among custodians and scientists as well.<br />I hesitate to say you will enjoy this book, because the subject is so wrenching; you may cry a few times. But it is a page turner. And you don't need to know anything about linguistics or developmental psychology to appreciate it.	2001-11-25

Then book goes much further; actually, this is a second edition, the first having been written before The Bell Curve.<br />This book is an indictment of the very concept of &quot;Intelligence Quotient&quot; as something ontological and fixed. It is also a debunking of the children and step-children, nieces and nephews of IQ testing.<br />The examples are so many: immigrants at Ellis Island were given IQ tests, and though the tests were non-English dependent, they were very much American culture dependent, and were given to people who might never have held a pencil before. White European men are the standard, and test which demonstrate them to be superior are assumed to be fair tests.<br />Gould recounts in a thoroughly readable, and even enticing style, several slices of history where terrible wrongs were done because IQ was assumed to exist as something quantifiable. The eugenics movement was just one, and it bore forced sterilisation based on supposed measurements of intelligence. Another is the ages old denial of education to women either under the delusion that it was a waste of time, or the crazy medical hypothesis that by using her brain, a woman would cause her uterus to shrink.<br />This is a brilliantly conceived book, thorough, enjoyable and provocative. It is polemic, so if you disagree, you will have to form your own argument, but Gould is forthright that he is not just reciting history, and rather arguing a position in the IQ debate.<br />If you disagree with Gould, and that will put you in a bad mood, don't read this book, because his argument is like the Rock of Gibralter. If you just want to read this end of the debate, this is the only book you need.	2001-11-25

The issue of my time was nuclear weaponry, and I, who really hadn't given much thought to war or peace, became a passionate pacifist, and in particular someone willing to go to the wall for disarmament.<br />I thought of growing up as something inevitable, that happened passively, with the passage of time; I never thought of taking hold of my maturation, and taking an active part in my development. After I read this book, my whole view of what is humanly possibly changed.<br />Vera Brittain &quot;soberly equipped in [her] new V.A.D. uniform... turned [her] back forever upon [her] provincial young ladyhood.&quot; At first suggestion, you'd think she merely left what was still essentially Victorian England for War, and returned to the modern era of the twenties. The fact is, a generation jaded, but also educated, and in a way, sophisticated by the Great War, ushered in the modern era. <br />This is the essence of the book, and the reason for its title, but this is not an academic thesis. This is a moving and eloquent personal account of one of the most wrenching events in recent history. There are passages in this book, such as the first time Vera sees American troops, as they march down the road past her camp, the I have read hundreds of times, have memorized with so many readings, and yet still make me cry. The book has become a part of my soul. My own copy, that I have had for nineteen years, I had to take to Kinko's to be spiral bound, I had worn out the binding. The edges are tattered, and some of the pages are stained because I have taken this book many places to continue reading it for the fourth, or seventh, or twelfth time.<br />People interested in WWI will enjoy reading a V.A.D.'s perspective; as far as I know, this is the only complete first-hand account of this war from a woman. But people who know nothing of the war will still be touched by Vera's recollections of those days, written from two decades later. <br />Another stunning thing is her treatment of her recollections; her memory is good, full of details that breathe life into her story. She is completely honest about herself, her deeds, and thoughts at the time, even one that might have embarrassed. She is fond of remarking on her naiveté, but does not poke fun at herself, or express regret over the course of her life. Obviously, she believes the war was a great and terrible tragedy, but if there were war, and there was, she went with her generation, and came home, and feels she could have done nothing else.<br />But she makes one of the most eloquent statements of war I have ever read when she remarks on the return of troops in masses when the war has finally ended. People are not cheering &quot;We won the war!&quot; she says, but merely sighing &quot;The war is over.&quot;<br />This is a beautiful and captivating book, but it isn't a light read; you have a relationship with this book, so be prepared for commitment.	2001-11-25

I'm an American Sign Language Interpreter, and I have a number of Deaf friends who have both Deaf and hearing children; the children without exception were signing with their parents (and with me!) by the age of nine months, and some earlier. I knew if I ever had a child I would sign to him or her, and confer this advantage. I never really thought of trying to sell hearing parents of hearing children on this idea, though, because learning ASL is a major undertaking.<br />However, I found the contents of this video to be very respectful of the language ASL, while admitting that signs, and not Sign Language, is being taught.<br />That being said, what is taught here is a very good foundation for learning ASL later. Unlike a lot of &quot;sign language&quot; introductory books, this doesn't focus solely of the semantics of handshapes, but on the idea of whole body language, and the importance of observation in communication. For example, people using this video will pick up facial expressions, and learn to maintain eye-to-eye contact, rather than eye-to-hand. <br />Also, creativity is stressed over memorizing handshapes, so that the signs are more meaningful for the child. This is very appropriate in that Deaf children of Deaf parents use a lot of &quot;home signs,&quot; which are signs unique to that child's or family's usage, are used when a child is very young, and are easier to produce or in some way more meaningful for the child than the &quot;real&quot; sign. Home signs are discarded when a child starts school. At any rate, this is an excellent way for children to begin to be creative and expressive in the way they communicate many YEARS before they will be able to do so with spoken language. <br />The text is readable-- something a person with a baby can pick up and put down-- you don't need hours of uninterrupted concentration. The video and the reference are child-friendly, so that older children won't be left out.<br />As long as this remains child centered and communication centered, and doesn't become about rote memorization of signs, this will be a wonderful thing, an odyssey for parents and their babies-- and so much fun! I remember beginning sign language; it is such a joy. I discovered things my body communicated without my realizing it, and I also discovered that I could be much more observant by paying attention to just a few simple things.<br />Have fun-- so much awaits you!	2001-11-24

Gliding through this book was like being the first person on the ice after the zamboni had resurfaced it.<br />I have known about the idea of time as the fourth dimension, but until I read this book, I never understood it. I now also understand the difference between Newtonian and Einsteinian physics and relativity. The book is an education.<br />But it is so much more; it's not a textbook, it's a journey. Somehow Hawking has managed to write a scientific odyssey of the type that was previously the domain of writers of Natural, rather than Mathematical sciences.<br />The book contains copious color illustrations, but it scarcely needs to, because Hawking's language paints a canvas in the reader's mind. The reader is swept up in Hawking's enthusiasm, and like Alice following the White Rabbit down the hole, follows Hawking into a wonderland of curves and contours where time and space are inextricably tangled up, and time has shape. Particles, sheets, and strings travel through eleven dimensions; black holes appear and disappear, and superstring theory and p-branes may hold the final clue to the puzzle of this place where there is no up or down. <br />No science fiction novel could ever compete with this adventure.	2001-11-23

Books	3	2	2	N	N	Out of Print, but not Out of Sight	O'Doherty has researched his Viennese courts well, and his Mozart and Ben Franklin; the descriptions of Anton Mesmer seem so real, I'm pretty sure I've read them before. Not that it's a criticism to say he cribbed from contemporaneous descriptions; the blending of borrowed reportage with fictional text is actually done pretty well.<br />However, O'Doherty waxes much too purple for my taste when he lapses into streams of consciousness that seem to turn into whirlpools from which he cannot extricate himself. More unfortunately, while he has done tons of research on the details of say, seventeenth century Viennese table legs, he hasn't read too many diaries from the time. His prose seems awfully Victorian to me. Or pseudo-Victorian. Actually, there were times when it reminded me for all the world of Elinor Glyn.<br />His problem is that the novel isn't a seventeenth century form, and stream of consciousness, moreover, is a twentieth century construction. Still more incongruously, O'Doherty appears to have his eye on eighteenth century fictive diary prose such as Charlotte Bronte writes in Jane Eyre. However, he can't even separate the first person narrative of early novels from the stream of consciousness that readers today are familiar with. In addition, he uses three-point narration (Mlle. P., her father, and Anton Mesmer) and seems to be trying to do something along the lines of The Moonstone, yet another form that didn't exist in the seventeenth century. O'Doherty has set himself up for massive leaps of invention. Sadly, he never quite does what he sets out to do, and the thing shrivels in the bud.<br />I'm just addressing his prose style, though. If you can stomach it, then you have the pleasure of the devices he uses to work Mesmer, Mozart, Benjamin Franklin, Empress Maria Theresa, and most of the rest of the Hapsburg court, plus the French Revolution into 240 pages. They are actually pretty artful. So if you like that kind of stuff, and aren't fussy about the mode of communication, this might the book for you.<br />On top of that, there's sex, lots of it, and a blind girl Mesmer is trying to cure, and some neat messages about talent vs. function.<br />However, if you read for style and rhythm of language as much as plot, this will set your teeth on edge.<br />This novel may be technically out of print, but you can still buy it in many bookstores...There are probably lots of warehoused copies. Since it's on the Booker shortlist, there's a good chance it'll come back into print. Nonetheless, if you're interested, you ought to grab it while you can.	2001-11-22

Previously, it was simply thought that children couldn't be depressed. Perhaps this is because (as is learned from this book) the lethargy and weepiness that adults and adolescents experience during depression, in children is often expressed as hostility. The depressed children may in fact be the troublemakers and the discipline problems.<br />This book reports on few case histories, but because only twenty years of research are behind this subject, that isn't surprising. Most of the descriptive text looks at the stages of childhood depression, and what to expect from various treatment options. The authors do suggest that while several stressful situations such as parental divorce, or placement in foster care can lead to childhood depression, in most cases, there will be no single, obvious, precipitating factor, and parents should not look for one.<br />More than once, the authors state that depression is not the fault of the parents, or the result of bad parenting. Of course, what are they going to say, if they want parents to buy their book? Parents don't want to be blamed. At any rate, if they are voluntarily looking for help, the family is probably at a point where placing blame will not solve anything, so the authors are undoubtedly correct in this approach. The problem is that this approach appears to slant the book toward physiological causes of depression almost to the exclusion of environmental factors.<br />Nonetheless, the information presented is readable, clear, and written in a soothing narrative voice. Just reading the book may give relief to parents who are concerned about a child. <br />The book neatly describes external symptoms of childhood depression, offering a great deal of help to parents and people who work with children in identifying children who may be depressed. Much of the book is given over to choosing a therapist.This is so thoroughly commendable, I don't know where to begin, because it is not uncommon for people to walk into a therapist's office, and immediately turn over all their power. This book will help families hold onto themselves until they are certain they have the right person, not just for the child but for the whole family.<br />I would recommend this book over most of the others addressing this topic.	2001-11-16

I am personally responsible for Schocken Books rising 1 1/4 points on the New York market, in giving every single person I know (and some I do not) this book as a gift. My refrigerator has not been defrosted in over a year, and the rabbi is wondering when I will agree to read Torah again at shul, and my husband is wondering why my paychecks have been on the slender side lately, but I am out there on the streets making sure at least one more person a day learns of this wonderful book.<br />Gluckel was a Jewish woman who lived in Germany, with enough privilege to be often given permission to travel outside of the shtetl, and see other parts of the country. She traveled sometimes with her husband, a merchant, and at other times to meet and make arrangements with other families for the marriages of her children. More often, though, she stayed home with her fourteen children during the long periods of her husband's absences.<br />She and her husband were very much in love, albeit undoubtedly had had an arranged marriage, just as the ones she made for her children. In fact, the marriages of her children occupy much of the text.<br />Some of the rest is given to stories, stories that entertain as well as instruct, and can fairly be call aggadot, midrashim, and parables. But there's quite a lot of history: there is a fascinating first-hand account of the mission of the false messiah, Shabbtai Tzvi. I don't believe there exists another first-hand account of this event in this tenor: Gluckel does not know she is writing of one of the major events of history.<br />Gluckel's stated intent is to write the story of her family, so that her children will always know what sort of people they came from. This is the rest of the text: anecdotes about grandparents, aunts and uncles. <br />Gluckel's explanation for her need to compile such a document is that since her husband died, she finds it hard to sleep, and needs something to occupy the night hours, &quot;to drive away the idle melancholy thoughts that torment me.&quot; <br />Nonetheless, with all the recent expulsions and migrations of the Jews, Gluckel saw families split apart, and children growing up separated from cousins and grandparents, confined to different shtetls, in different countries (when the diary was begun, in 1690, less than 150 years had passed since the Catholic Church had consigned Jews to shtetls). So just as Jews in exile had compiled the Talmud, Gluckel may have been driven to keep written records as oral communication became difficult.<br />Fortunately that never happened. Still, we have Gluckel's wonderful memoir. She is a natural writer: she doesn't waste words, even when gossiping. This book is a page turner.<br />Gluckel came to life as I read this in a way few characters in books do-- I would swear, as I held it, I could feel a pulse. By the time I turned the last page, I felt as though I'd made a friend.	2001-11-15
US	51101066	RHISXDLDE2P87	0316926116	195949365	Vile Bodies	Books	5	9	14	N	N	Evelyn Waugh Revisited	This is my very favorite of Waugh's novels. Don't talk to me of Brideshead Revisited or A Handful of Dust. When I read this for the first time as a teenager, it was my Siamese twin-- well, the times that teachers hadn't confiscated copies of it. I bought one new copy from a bookstore just because I heard there was a caricature of Rosa Lewis, but I was hooked on Vile Bodies from page one, long before I ever got to the part about the Rosa Lewis character.<br />I ended up buying two more copies from a used book store, then stealing a library copy with the help of a flathead screwdriver and some needle-nosed pliers (to pull out the magnetic theft-alert strip), when I figured teachers wouldn't confiscate a copy from the University library.<br />That's how desperate I was to devote every waking minute to this book until I finished it.<br />The reason it was hard to hide was the fact that I laughed out loud so many times while reading it. Right in the middle of the &quot;Cell&quot; unit in Biology class, I got to the part about the &quot;angels,&quot; and began to giggle, and the more I tried to suppress my laughter, the more it grew out of control. My teacher asked what I found so funny about plant cells that hadn't been funny about animal cells, and then the book was gone.<br />You just can't go wrong with this book. The humor is very sharp, and cut neatly. There's not a single ragged edge here. Too completely mix my metaphors, there's not a cheap shot. No lame jokes. Waugh is perfect.<br />Of course, there is a theme underlying his humor. All the humor is directed at time-wasters, be they bureaucrats, the leisure class, or religious types who offer nothing but vague promises of &quot;salvation&quot; in exchange for your, &quot;thank you,&quot; donation. He lays some of the blame for the precipitousness of these types on WWI, and England being in some way not &quot;over it.&quot; On the other hand, this book is his attempt to pick people up and shake them and say &quot;Get over it!&quot; (OK, not in those exact words, but you get the idea.)<br />This book is not didactic, though. You are free to ignore the message, and just read the book for its humor. You won't regret it.	2001-11-14

The disabilities vary: they are developmental, sensory and physical. What the disabilities are doesn't matter as much as who the children are. Author Lydia Gans is sensitive to the fact that two children with cerebral palsy may have very different personalities, and effect their siblings very differently, than may two children with similar personalities and different disabilities.<br />As much as the text, the 142 photographs of these families show the uniqueness of each one. What is especially important about this book is that the focus is not on the disabled children, but on their siblings. Moreover, Gans has not asked the siblings their feelings about disabilities, but from the text, has simply asked them to talk about their brothers and sisters: what do they do together, what things do they have in common, what tastes do they share, what kinds of rivalry do they experience? What's most likely to make them fight? In some cases, siblings volunteered that they care for a brother or sister, and Gans leaves this with no comment. Eventually the reader notices a pattern, and realizes that most of the siblings who assumed caretaker roles were older than the disabled child. Some sibs did push wheelchairs, but some coasted along, standing on the back of the chair. <br />Gans includes no analytic text. Analysis is for the reader. However, the picture is overall happy. I hate to spoil things with my own analysis, so I won't. I'll just say that I work in habilitation and developing community living skills in disabled adolescents and adults, and these families were quite real to me; they could all be people I know and work with. <br />I believe this book explores an under-reported aspect of disabled people's lives, and I'm very glad it has been published.	2001-11-12
US	51101066	R3DC6QNE15ZLX	0671750992	668723338	A Parent'S Guide To Autism: A Parents Guide To Autism	Books	3	16	16	N	N	The Autism Society of America Manifesto	Though Hart is not a professional dealing with Pervasive Developmental Disorders, he has come by the capacity to write about this subject as both the parent and brother of autistic individuals. He is also a former editor of Advocate, the official publication of the Autism Society of America. In this book, he addresses a number of questions beginning, as such books usually begin, with the definition of autism. <br />The book is one long Nay-say, disguised as skepticism. Hart explains that autism is the result of brain structure, not brain chemistry, and is therefore pre-natal; autism cannot caused by such things as food allergies and vaccinations. Hart does not explain why such things might be cited as causes, which makes them seem especially like quackery. When he says that people who do such things as denying their children whole foods groups, and therefore necessary nutrients, or withholding vaccinations are making serious mistakes and putting their children in danger, the reader is forced to agree because the other side is not present to defend itself. He adds that autism is not a psychosis, and therefore anti-psychotic drugs for schizophrenics will not help those with autism. And Hart says all these things so gently and kindly. Accept the child, he begs; love him for who he is; don't send the message that he is unacceptable unless he changes. <br />He then explains in detail what happens when different therapies, such as sensory integration therapy, or squeeze (Temple Grandin's) therapy are used. He quotes Temple Grandin quite a lot. I'm a professional in the field, and I'm familiar with these therapies, and they are all very good therapies; the information in this part of the book is quite good. However, the dairy-free and wheat-free diets work too, for some children, and I know because I've seen it. I also know that the vaccinations have been implicated, and while I wouldn't withhold one from my child, if I already had one autistic child, I might consult a pediatric neurologist before vaccinating a second child. I also know that while anti-psychotic drugs don't help, other classes of drugs do. Some children (not all) benefit from mega-vitamins, and others from an anti-fungal drug called nystatin. <br />You won't find any of this information in the book, and the reason is that this book is polemic. This book is about the Autism Society of America, and its party line. (You also with find only a very negative attack on the Options Institute, about which I personally have reservations, but is important enough that parents should get unbiased information.) I don't think this book should be titled A Parent's Guide to Autism: Answers to the Most Common Questions. It should be called What the Autism Society of America Wants You to Know about Autism. <br />Hart's writing is very engaging, and the book is an easy read, but it's already dated, and there much better books out. Pick something else.	2001-11-12

There's no reason to buy it unless you're such a Kennediphile, that it matters to you which works in this completely standard fare appealed to someone once married to a Kennedy. <br />Jackie O., or the First Lady of the Kennedy Administration, or John-John's mother, or however you care to think of her, is one of those people who, as Andy Warhol once said, is famous for being famous. Since she worked as a publisher, one might have high expectations for her personal collection of poetry: does it contain original drafts of well- known works?-- perhaps even uncensored versions; or unpublished works of recent authors?-- early rejects of Maya Angelou's writings, or Marge Piercy's juvenilia? Perhaps this volume might contain poems written by people we never knew wrote poetry: her son, Lyndon Johnson, anyone; maybe she has fresh and unpublished translations of Greek or Latin poetry! No such luck. Whatever hopes one might have held that the book would justify her place in the American imagination are dashed. <br />I don't want to dismiss the book out of hand, because most of the poems here are very good, they are simply all recognized poems whose greatness is not in dispute, and this book adds nothing to them. So we know that a former First Lady liked them; so what? So do most people. Maybe next year we'll learn that Mrs. Onassis ate food and enjoyed sunny days.<br />Leave the Kennedys alone. They're not royalty, and they're not even good examples of anything.	2001-11-11

There is a world outside of celebrating Christmas, without taking cruises, or getting your feet wet and cursing white chocolate. I'm sure there must have been some Wassermans or Feinsteins in the neighborhood who were likewise not displaying the huge Frosty on their rooves. Since I never believed the premise, much of the humor eluded me. I suppose Grisham could be using the Kranks (Yiddish word, that, by the way) to symbolize the psychic pressure some people feel to be &quot;merry&quot; at this time of year whether they feel so or not, so the literal compulsion is merely a metaphor; if so, though, it escaped me.<br />Instead of getting mauled at the mall and the grocery store right before Christmas, most of us non-participants plan ahead, and stay away from all shopping venues the week or so before. It seemed to me that the inevitable magnetism of Christmas was not some mystic power, but the result of poor planning.<br />So why did I read the book? The title was appealing-- I don't &quot;skip&quot; Christmas, in my mind: it's just another day. I thought a book about people tossing away the hype and trying to rediscover quietude, which even for non-celebrants is hard to find the more hassled and harried your co-workers get, would be nice. Instead I had Rebel without a Candy Cane-- which is another thing: Luther Krank is thoroughly unlikable. Perhaps if I had liked him I would have had an easier time suspending my disbelief through this outlandish premise.<br />I doubt it, though.	2001-11-11

I appreciate so much that Lynn Hamilton has included so many current methods, and experimental dietary and supplement trials in this book, even ones that didn't work for her son. So many times I have read of parents dismissing as snake oil something that simply was not right for their particular child. Autism is a spectrum disorder, and will require a spectrum of treatments, not every one effective for every child-- or adult.<br />I also appreciate Hamilton's honesty about her frustrations with her son before he received appropriate treatment. Some parents think they are alone in being swept into anger when their child is out of control, so I am glad when parents admit this; if enough do, eventually all will feel safe in doing so. Sometimes diagnoses are missed when parents are afraid at first to admit exactly what their children do, because they are afraid to admit their reactions to it.<br />My only reservation in recommending this book is the pervasive religious references in its text. I realize that the Hamiltons have been missionaries, and I realize that they turned to their faith when they learned of their son's autism, and that these are simply facts which it would be awkward to conceal. I also realize that most of the religious references were restricted to the beginning of the book, the family's personal story; the latter half, the general information about autism contains minimal references, but as far as I am concerned, one is too much here. I also realize she referred to family and community prayer efforts, as well as practical efforts to help her son as &quot;Operation Rescue Ryan,&quot; and that this is a fact, not a piece of fiction invented for the book; nonetheless it jarred me. I am not a non-religious person; however, I do wish the book had come with some sort of caveat.<br />Overall, the book is excellent, and readable, but if constant references to another's spiritual life will bother you, you've been warned.	2001-11-10

It's hard to see from a distance her colossal impact on the literary world. When you buy this book (and you WILL buy it; these aren't the droids you're looking for) immediately read some of the very earliest stories. They are of WWI vintage or so. If you remember high school literature, short stories written just before Parker put pen to paper were the somewhat longer &quot;chapter of a novel&quot; type, of Guy de Maupassant, or W. Somerset Maugham. Dorothy Parker virtually invented the &quot;slice of life&quot; short story, which she brought to the New Yorker. This style became the standard of the fledgling magazine, popular with the public, and without a doubt helped get the magazine off the ground.<br />This style is still the pervasive one today.<br />Short stories were not all Mrs. Parker wrote. She wrote play reviews, and as Constant Reader book reviews. She could dismiss a play with &quot;House Beautiful is Play Lousy,&quot; or take down her least favored AA Milne with &quot;Tonstant Weader frowed up.&quot; She once spent the better part of a review complaining about her hang-over. She kept New Yorker readers coming back week after week, laugh junkies after a fix. And so she changed the voice of the reviewer as well. Previously, the reviewer voice had been detached and quite dry, rattling off obligatory lines about the costumes, the sets, the leading actor, the leading actress-- as predictable as the label on a shampoo bottle. The wonderful Libby Gelman-Waxner is her direct descendent. Pauline Kael is a niece, although she might have bristled at the suggestion. Andrew Harris and Elvis Mitchell can thank Mrs. Parker for their unfettered freedom.<br />The best thing about reading this collection is discovering the sheer joy Mrs. Parker took in writing. She was good and she knew it.<br />She once said, in reviewing the unfortunate book Debonair, that the curse of a satirist is that&quot;she writes superbly of the things she hates,&quot; but when she tries to write of things she likes, &quot;the result is appalling.&quot; Personally, I find Parker moving and eloquent in her reviews of the Journal of Katherine Mansfield, and Isadora Duncan's posthumously published autobiography, two books that touched and impressed her, but it is true that her distinctive voice croons most seductively when she doesn't like something. Unfortunately, one is left with the impression that she didn't like much other than gin, Seconal and dogs, but I don't think that's true. If she were as unhappy as is commonly believed, she would have escalated her suicidal behavior, and not have lived to the age of 74. She would not have had the passion to march for the acquittal of Sacco and Venzetti, to travel to Spain during the country's civil war, to volunteer as a war correspondent during WWII, and to join in voice and body the civil rights movement in her last decade. <br />I think disdain rather than anger is a better word for what she felt towards the targets of her wit-- and it is true that sometimes a retrospective view of her own behavior was the target, but the ability to laugh at oneself is the sign of, well, if not mental health, at least a well-rounded emotional self.<br />And by the way, since Parker had no heirs, she left her estate, including future earnings from her work, to Dr. Martin Luther King jr., and when he sadly died the year after she did, he passed on the right to profit from the Parker works to the NAACP, so for every copy of this book sold, the author's cut profits the NAACP.	2001-11-09

The book has been out for several years, and it's just my bad luck to have recently discovered it; I'm  happy though, to live in a time when such information is open to the public, and open almost as soon as it is known.<br />The lecturers proceed through the phases of the life of Jesus-- or rather, chronologically as they would through the life of any person. The lectures deduce from archeological information the politics of the times, and reason to the kind of message Jesus must have delivered in order to attract a following. They are not afraid of the implications of,  for example, the fact that Jesus came from Galilee. They dismiss with granite hard logic, the infancy narratives of Luke and Matthew as fiction, and then proceed to deal with the fact that Jesus' origins in Galilee meant certain things, and here in what they are.<br />The gospels are not dealt with as historical documents, but they are dealt with as texts that contain valuable information of the nature of Jesus message, (or at any rate, the public's reception of it)  and therefore what made him attractive as a missionary figure. Several of the lecturers peel away layers of the texts to show different historical additions and interpolations. Jesus' eschatological message may not have been part of his original message after all, we learn.<br />This book is full of tightly packed prose, with little &quot;paradigmatic&quot; lecturese to wade through-- it's actually exciting to read. If you have the opportunity, you may read it in one setting.<br />I guess that the lectures must have come from notes, and not transcriptions, because they are chatty to different degrees. Some almost seem to be transcriptions, and some read like book chapters. I found this jarring at first, but as I read more, I found that it helped me distinguish among the lecturers, and that this was helpful.<br />My only reservation is Stephen J. Patterson's &quot;Sources for a Life of Jesus.&quot; There is nothing new here. He gives the usual information about the historical question of the primacy of Matthew, the Markan Priority Hypothesis, the Q Hypothesis, the interpolation of Josephus, the Talmud Sanhedrin, etc. Anyone who has read a book on the historical Jesus before can skip this lecture.<br />And anyone with even a cursory interest in the Jesus of history should read this book.	2001-11-09

I think psychics are bunk, and the dead don't talk. It's not a question of faith, because I'm a religious Jew. I also want to say that I think fans of his show forget too easily that he premiered on the Sci-Fi channel. That stands for Science FICTION, folks.<br />I've seen the show, and I see him use all kinds of standard psychic tricks that have been used by hundreds of performers before him, some admitted actors, others exposed frauds. Edward uses letters instead of whole names when he trolls for a mark; almost every time, Edward is saved from providing the name-- the mark does it for him. But he slyly appears to have pulled it out of the air. He elicits information, then provides generalities, and makes a few educated guesses; ones that don't get picked up by the mark are immediately dropped. The strategem could only be more obvious if it were written on a sandwich board that Edward wore as he moved around the studio.<br />That disclaimer out of the way, I liked the book. For one thing, Edward has not, as far as I can tell, employed an (excuse the expression), &quot;ghost writer.&quot; He has the kishkas to write his book himself. He also has a narrative voice that is all his own. He switches from the present, to the imperfect, and occasionally to the past, seeming capricious. But he must have been more careful than he seems; the reader is never confused. There is a feel to the book that it was written all in one day; there's a breathless quality, as though he can't get the words out fast enough. It's compelling.<br />Most of all, the series of anecdotes are not always flattering. Sometimes he presents himself as petty, and other times as a buffoon. I can respect someone who will put that into words, even if I don't like his choice of career.<br />Of course, he always does come out on top, in a Bertie Wooster- like fashion, and he is harsh on skeptics; I'm surprised at his dismay over skeptics. I would think anyone in his profession would expect and except that they are part of his chosen profession. <br />The only thing that would have made me like this book more were for it to be a novel.	2001-11-08

In small bits, however.<br />Sometimes the book overwhelms me, and I feel the author tried to tackle too large a subject. Any scholar who writes about the &quot;voice&quot; of the Biblical narrator is being disingenuous to pretend that there is but one voice in the Bible. However, Dr. Sternberg suggests this in his opening sentence: &quot;What goals does the biblical narrator set himself?&quot;<br />The book considers parts of the Bible discretely many times, and within each discrete frame, the information and analysis is excellent, but I think the Sternberg fails to tie it all up by discussing the possibility that all of Deuteronomy and the book of Jeremiah may be one voice, Leviticus contains one, one of which is present in Exodus, but not the other, Genesis consists of two voices, one of which is present to a very small degree in Leviticus, and more in Numbers, and then goes on the write Joshua. Etc. This is common theory, though Sternberg has a right to reject it. I just wish he'd acknowledged it.<br />But as I said, his analysis of each topic is excellent; much of his information is startling and refreshing.	2001-11-07
US	51101066	RAAGG266SLEP	0674069412	491325562	The Bible As It Was	Books	5	95	98	N	N	A Sigh of Relief	As one who has waded through Genesis Rabbah all the way to Deuteronomy, scratching my head, making marginal notes like Rashi, and looking up almost every word, this book came like a 500 BTU central unit, to a cottage deep in the rain forest.<br />Dr. Kugel has gathered thousands of lines of commentary from unnumbered sources, but all from a 300 year time period, about 200bce to 100ce-- the same time the gospels and epistles were written, the Mishnah was codified and most of the rabbis of the Pirkei Avot were active. <br />Kugel quotes standard Jewish commentary, but he also quotes from Christian scriptures, treating them (as Christian scholar Rosemary Reuther suggested many years ago) as midrash upon the Jewish texts. He also uses standard histories of the time, such as Josephus' Antiquities, the works of Philo, and the Dead Sea Scrolls.<br />What makes this extensive work such a relief and a delight are the extensive annotations of the author: accurate citations are always given (I checked); end notes are given, describing all sources, and giving dates, or approximate dates. There is a bibliography of modern sources as well. Most importantly, each time a midrash or other commentary is inserted into the text of the Torah, Kugel gives us a most essential bit of information: he tells us what the problem is with that text that the commentator feels needs explaining.<br />It is not always obvious to a reader 2,000 years later what a certain rabbi's problem was with a text that prompted him to write the several lines of commentary he left us. The work Kugel has done-- his gift to us, is to climb into the minds of these people in a different place, discover what their concerns were, and deduce what parts of the texts would have caught their attention and for what reason. Since none of his interpretations (at least none I have looked-- and I've looked at most of them) seem forced or overly creative, I believe this is the work of a great scholar. I cherish it, and I thank him much.	2001-11-07

In my experience, children with Asperger's Syndrome, Tourette's Syndrome, and mild hearing impairments are frequently misdiagnosed as ADHD, or not diagnosed at all.<br />I realize that the purpose of the book it to provide advice, and moreover reassurance for parents with difficult children, and Dr. Turecki may have considered including a chapter on easily misdiagnosed disabilities, abandoning the idea for fear that it would worry parents.<br />Moreover, much of the advice in the book would help parents locked into circular behavior patterns even with children who have mild disabilities.<br />Turecki has much insight into a child's perception of the world, and he reminds parents of many of the feelings they once had, but have long ago forgotten: what it was like to wait interminably in a store in line, not knowing the reason, and too small to see over the display counters, for example. Turecki discusses children's perceptions of many common situations, and goes on to explain that these situations are even more difficult for a child who is especially active, oversensitive to smells or temperatures, afraid of crowds, or not predictable in appetite or bathroom habits.<br />In an engaging narrative voice, Turecki lays out different factors of temperament, and catagorizes children according to the areas in which each seems to be overly, or under sensitive. Some children just CAN'T sit still; it's their nature. If the same child is overwhelmed by smells, and frightened by new places, a trip to an unfamiliar restaurant is likely to be a disaster, and it might be better to leave the child with a sitter.<br />Turecki does not place blame anywhere: he simply acknowledges that this is the child's temperament (a word he uses frequently). It is not the child's fault. He is not misbehaving on purpose to &quot;get&quot; his parents -- much as they may feel so. He is not whining to get his way.<br />On the other hand, this is not the parents' fault when other people look at them, or ask why they can't control their child, the answer is that the child is very difficult. Almost ad infinitem, Turecki pours reassurance over the parents of difficult children. He borrows a term already in use, and refers in quotes to he most difficult &quot;mother-killers.&quot; He tells the mothers of these children, &quot;Yes, you do work harder; no you don't get the same 'pay-off' other parents get, and it's not fair.&quot;<br />But them after analysis, he offers several chapters of creative solutions for dealing effectively with these children, and lowering the stress and tension in the house, as well as quelling the covert message to the child that he is the cause of the problems. These are set out in an easy to follow 6 chapter program. The parent may not see progress immediately (or might; the program looks very effective), but just knowing that a program is being followed, and having the book to turn to will be reassuring to many parents. Even if the child is not yet showing progress, the parents will know they are doing something, and that alone may give them some personal relief.	2001-11-03
US	51101066	R3PVUV2HPFAID8	0807023884	987891529	Where Is Daddy?	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Eek!	This is a really wrenching book, and while it's written in simple language, I can't give it a blanket recommendation for all pre-schoolers-- which is to say, children the age of the protagonist. I suppose children actually facing parental divorce might find the book cathartic, and in particular children who haven't been able to give voice to their feelings might find some of the words they need in this book; however, I'd worry that children not facing divorce might find the book needlessly frightening. This isn't a neutral book to explain the concept of divorce to children who just need the concept defined because they see it on TV and in the families of their friends. In fact, the book never really does define divorce, since the book is about a pre-schooler's emotional experience of it, and it maintains this narrow focus. I suspect that the author may have actually intended the book for divorcing parents as much as for their small children, because at its heart, the book is a plea to remember the child's perspective-- her perspective, not merely her feelings. Pre-schoolers with their limited vocabulary don't differentiate much between the expression of grief and of anger, and the protagonist demonstrates exactly this, to the great confusion of the adults around her. Beth Goff has a profound understanding of a preschooler's mindset, and lets the reader see so clearly what the adults in the book miss. By misreading the little girl's emotions, they fail to allow her to feel safe in expressing them. Only when they finally come to understand what she is trying to express does she begin to reconcile herself to the reality of the divorce. Painful as it will be, I would like every divorcing parent with a small child to read this.	2001-08-26

He doesn't dumb it down, nor remove such huge slices that we are fools walking that dangerous tightrope of a little knowledge. Equal evidence of his genius is his broad base of real knowledge. He knows linguistics, for example; he would recognize that he does not know as much as Noam Chomsky, but he knows a great deal more than the typical lay person.<br />He uses this knowledge at the beginning of this book to construct a carnival of phrenology and psychoanalysis that gives a social context to his later discussion of ontogeny and phylogeny. Looking at the subject of the title outside of this context would make a reader feel awfully disconnected from the people who believed this. It helps to rememeber that history is the story of a species and its learning process.<br />One hundred years from now, people may know things that make them skake their heads at our use of protease inhibitors in treating AIDS, CD-ROM's in computer operations, or at the fact that only autistic kids, and not even all of them used weighted vests to develope proprioceptive skills.<br />The book made me feel superior, and at the same time humbled. No single person is capable of what our species can do as a whole.	2001-06-28

It's a page turner that isn't a paperback mystery. In fact, people who have heard of Laura Bridgman in the first place pretty much know how the story comes out. Freeberg has a taut and clear style that gives the information bones and ligaments, and he has done thorough research. There are photos and copies of things in Laura's handwriting that I have never seen before, and I have been in the field of disability all my adult life. I've read just about everything on Laura Bridgman and the Perkins school.<br />Freeberg did well in choosing to focus of Laura's education. The book would have been at least three times longer, and probably not as well organized had he tried to cover her entire life in one volume. By sticking just to the subject of her education, though, he shows use the brilliance of her teacher, Howe, who relied on instincts and experience, and made things up as he went along. And we see Laura's mind grow. In our day, the lay person is fairly familiar with the stages of human intellectual growth and development, and it is exciting to see how Laura is remediated for the things she missed because her communication skills were late in coming.<br />Freeberg is also respectful and gracious to his topic. Laura is a wonderful person in her own right. She is not Helen Keller's shadow. Helen Keller is a once-an-epoch genius. Laura was a bright and friendly woman, and I thank Freeberg for reminding us of this.	2001-06-28
US	51101066	R1E02WPYMNHMJX	0312970986	22929164	The Hyperactivity Hoax: How to Stop Drugging Your Child and Find Real Medical Help	Books	4	6	9	N	Y	Skeptical Inquirer	I cramp my brain trying to decide what the skeptical position is in regard to Ritalin and ADHD. ADHD is not a new syndrome; it was first described over a hundred years ago, yet some people seem still to want to debate its very existence, like the shooter on the grassy knoll. Does ADHD exist? yes. Is it true that too many Ritalin prescriptions are written? probably. But too many antibiotic prescriptions are also written, and many too many Valium prescriptions no doubt, as well. <br />Certainly any book that denies the existence of ADHD with the ancient canard of weak parenting, a la the 1950's &quot;rejecting mother&quot; theory of autism is better used to level a shaky table. But this isn't such a book. Although there are no empirical studies here-- everything is anecdotal-- here is example upon example of other medical causes of hyperactive behavior, other than an organic brain disorder that must be treated neuro-chemically. So it's not bad parenting. But it's not necessarily the nebulous ADHD either. The book is simply a plea to look closer.<br />Anyone who has taken a college undergrad class in neurology or biochemistry and behavior knows that minute differences in fetal brain development, or in neurotransmitter production can lead to vast changes in behavior, so ADHD is theoretically possible if nothing else. But this is because the brain is a body organ like any other. Disrupt the function of any organ, and you are liable to see behavior changes. Introduce heavy metal to the bloodstream, or parasites to the intestines, remove a necessary nutrient from the diet through poor metabolism, or by poor diet, and see behavior changes. Even the weather can affect behavior. <br />My only wish for the book is that Dr. Walker had discussed in more depth some of the organic neurologic disorders that can include hyperactivity, such as Fragile X Syndrome, Asperger's Syndrome, and Tourette's Syndrome. Children with these syndromes could benefit from medication (though not necessarily Ritalin) in conjunction with behavior habilitation. <br />There are so many possibilities, so many ways for the environment to influence behavior, and the liklihood of an organic disorder to exist in the absence of other symptoms so small, that a rush to the prescription pad is at best shortsighted, and at worst malpractice. I thank Dr. Walker for breaking this ice; I hope that physicians, neurologists, and other qualified professionals will join him.	2001-06-25
