The symposium featured presentations from seven of the company's leaders.  Among the speakers, one person emerged from the pack as a superlative communicator.  That was Theo Gilbert-Jamison, who was Vice President for Training and Development for the corporation.<br /><br />Soon afterward, she left the Ritz-Carlton after a stellar seventeen-year career, to establish her own training company.  While this was not good news for the Ritz-Carlton, it was great news for other corporations, who will benefit from her speaking, consulting and training.<br /><br />Now even those who do not get the privilege of bringing her to their organization will have access to her training concepts and system, through The Six Principles of Service Excellence.  I predict that this book will bring significant, beneficial changes to the way organizations train their employees.  The author does not rely on an annual renewal day that makes the work force feel good for a short period.  Instead, she offers a well-organized, thorough training system that permeates the organization--at every level, and permanently.<br /><br />Fortunately, Theo Gilbert-Jamison writes as forcefully as she speaks.  The book provides ample visual illustrations, too.<br /><br />An unexpected bonus: Chapter Ten advises the reader on how to apply the Six Principles of Service Excellence to your personal life.<br /><br />You will welcome the results this book will generate, as will your clients, customers, employees and investors.<br /><br />If I had read this book when I started my twenty-three year management career, the organizations I directed would have been more harmonious, more motivated, more productive and more customer-centered.<br /><br />You'd better read her advice and implement it, because your competitors surely will.	2005-09-12

No longer can we simply present information--no matter how valuable--in dry, pedantic fashion.  Now our clients expect \\"edu-tainment,\\" a mixture of learning and levity.<br /><br />In this fine book, Roy Lantz weds that combination admirably.

The answer is simple: because we all have dreams, aspirations, inner sparks yearning to become flames.<br /><br />Sometimes these dreams are private.  We may not even admit them fully to ourselves.  Traditionally, these are our \\"pipe dreams,\\" our Walter Mitty fantasies.<br /><br />At other times we describe our dreams to family and friends.  Yet we don't go beyond that.  We simply talk, get mired in \\"what if\\" and count time until the weekend and the monthly paycheck.<br /><br />Stacey Mayo's excellent book helps readers move beyond daydreaming, helping them fashion a plan that takes them from speculation to success.<br /><br />This book is very interesting.  Mayo's interviews read like conversation at a mid morning coffee break.<br /><br />Fortunately, after each interview she helps you take specific steps to apply the action principles that she has uncovered.<br /><br />As an entrepreneur who took the big leap to fulfill his dream eight years ago, I can report that Stacey Mayo offers practical guidelines for venturesome spirits.

That's right--he learned so much from a potentially tragic event that he decided to look for opportunities in every circumstance.  To the reader's advantage, Futch offers valuable life lessons with upbeat humor.<br /><br />Ken Futch has garnered wide recognition as a speaker, corporate trainer and coach.  Readers of Take Your Best Shot will find out how he acquired the wisdom he shares with companies and executives.  Yes, he earned a university degree.  Still, much of his education came from working in his father's service station, serving in the Vietnam War and becoming a top producer and trainer with AT&T.<br /><br />His book will help you examine how to handle life's challenges successfully.  Although you might not experience a physical shot in the head as he did, you are likely to suffer disappointments over the promotion or raise you did not get, the unforeseen family crisis and the boss who cannot even spell the word empathy, much less demonstrate it.<br /><br />As a professional speaker myself, I suggest that you give special attention to Chapter Ten, \\"Highly Rewarded Skills,\\" in which Futch gives his tips and strategies for becoming a top-level communicator.  Those of us who have seen Ken Futch speak recognize that he is well worth listening to on this topic.<br /><br />Take Your Best Shot will amuse you, while prompting plenty of \\"aha\\" moments.  Futch's heartwarming stories earn him the \\"raconteur\\" designation.  As you read, you will sense that you are having a conversation with the author.  I assure you that the conversation will be highly enjoyable and permanently profitable.	2005-03-22

You will enjoy reading these intensely personal and often dramatic stories, and you will reinforce what you learned with the first book.<br />Covey does a fine job of elaborating, as good teachers do, on the points made by the contributors.	2004-06-23

This book takes care of that need, by portraying the total dedication of a group of soliders who grew up together, fought together, cried together, grieved together, and became triumphant together. Fortunately, the book brings the same &quot;you are there&quot; sensation provided by the video series, which I saw before reading the book.<br />If you want to teach your group about teamwork, start with this book.  They will learn what it means to be totally dedicated to a mission, and to give of yourself far more sacrificially than anyone could expect.<br />This book portrays one of the most heroic periods in American history.

Vince Dooley's influence and direct involvement made these advances possible, too.<br />Because he advocates team accomplishments more than individual heroism, Dooley-Georgia's Head Football Coach for twenty-five years, who retained his Director of Athletics title until June 30, 2004-might refute this claim.  Still, those who have followed Georgia's progress during his four decades of leadership will agree that these achievements would not have happened without him.<br />Co-author Loran Smith once captained UGA's track team, then became the longtime Executive Secretary of the Georgia Bulldog Club.  In many ways, Smith serves as the Bulldogs' scribe, because Dooley's Dawgs is one of several books he has produced to chronicle \\"The Bulldog Nation.\\"  On game days, he's the radio host for the Bulldogs' Tailgate Show, and fans hear his post-game interviews.  Additionally, his newspaper and magazine articles appeal to sports fans nationwide.<br />I recommend Dooley's Dawgs as the finest sports book I have ever read.  Bombarded as we are by news reports about college athletic scandals, you will be uplifted by the story of how discipline, fairness, integrity, respect for academics, and hard work turned Georgia football from an also-ran into national champions-and produced principled young men who became lifelong leaders.<br />To Dooley and Smith's credit, the book does not gloss over the tough times.  You'll read about criticisms of Dooley's conservative offense (\\"Georgia kicked off, then let the air out of the ball,\\" an Athens sports writer charged), the frustration of mediocre seasons, and the highly controversial non-extension of Dooley's contract in 2003.  I applaud the book's candor.<br />Even readers who are unfamiliar with Georgia's tradition will enjoy Dooley's Dawgs.  I give this book my highest recommendation.ecame lifelong leaders.<br />To Dooley and Smith's credit, the book does not gloss over the tough times.

Repeatedly I heard, \\"We sold our last copy an hour ago.\\"  Once I read the book, I understood why the demand was so high.<br />When I first heard the title, my assumption was that the story was about physicians in training.  However, soon I realized that \\"intern\\" took on new meaning during a recent Presidential term.  With that in mind, I was not surprised that the book was about a testosterone-driven political leader.<br />Intern reminded me of Lord Acton's famous saying: \\"Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\"  This novel reflects today's headlines in many ways.  Politicians, super athletes, actors, musicians, and others who merit the term \\"icon\\" forget their vulnerability.  Having received special treatment for most of their lives, they have escaped consequences that ordinary citizens would face.  However, as in the case of Intern's central figure Eric Barry, a day of reckoning comes.  Immunity vanishes.  Lies and intrigue do not work any longer.  A noose tightens, and exit doors close.<br />Possibly the book's strongest appeal lies in the realistic dialogue.  Bonnie Hearn Hill has her characters speak to each other using genuine conversational style, quite unlike what we hear on soap operas or read in tabloids.<br />Although this is the first Bonnie Hearn Hill book I have read, it won't be the last.  I will read what is available now, and anticipate the two books she writes annually.	2004-02-27

However, she focuses most of her attention on \\"the business of writing.\\"<br />Readers will respond favorably to Hill's mission:  To save other talented writers from the mistakes she made early in her career when she pitched her materials to publishers.  You will welcome her candor.  She admits her early blunders, and tells us how to avoid them.  Enriching her readability, her keen sense of humor surfaces and resurfaces throughout the book.<br />At the end of each chapter, she lists rules writers should follow to become consistently paid writers.  Concluding the book, she repeats the rules-all 112 of them.<br />Her advice covers: proper letterheads, query letters, how to follow up with the editor who has held your article too long, using the Internet judiciously, and much more that relates to getting the free out of freelance.<br />Good news: Knowing that she has excelled as a nonconformist at times, she encourages readers to exercise poetic license with her proposed rules.  After all, \\"None of this means you have to write a paint-by-number piece.\\"  One of her views as an iconoclast: Query letters may just delay a decision, rather than speeding up the decision by sending the manuscript itself.<br />Had I bought this book two decades ago, my submissions to editors would have generated a much greater percentage of paid acceptances.  I recommend The (Expanded) Freelancer's Rulebook enthusiastically.	2004-02-03

The 2,000 Percent Solution merits my praise also.<br />\\"The purpose of this book,\\" the authors state, \\"is to shock you out of your complacency, to get you to think, and to get you to act.\\"  Why?  Because \\"no matter how successful your organization is, it is performing way below its easily achievable potential.  If your organization is like most, it is probably functioning below average in many important activities.\\"<br />The \\"2,000 percent solution\\" proposes that we can become twenty times more productive and efficient, whether we are operating a large corporation or an entrepreneurial venture with limited staffing.  That's mind-boggling. . .not just doubling or tripling our results, but multiplying them twenty times over.<br />During my twenty-three years in management, I encountered every \\"stall\\" the authors describe.  Even worse, I created some of them myself.  Too bad I didn't know about their \\"stall busters\\" then.<br />In every chapter, the book reminds me of Socrates' teaching method.  Like him, the authors ask probing questions, challenging readers to abandon comfort, lethargy, outworn traditions, and harmful habits.<br />I consider The 2,000 Percent Solution an ideal book for a company's training session.  The next time I direct one of my seminars, I will open with this quotation from chapter nine: \\"If your productivity rose by 15 percent this year, but you had the potential for 50 percent gains, you may have actually lost ground against current and future competititors.\\"<br />Mitchell, Coles, and West made me reexamine my goals.  As a result, my \\"future best practice\\" has changed.  Yours will too, after you read this provocative book.	2003-07-30

Bookstores offer an abundance of books urging professional people to change or become obsolete-yet most of them fall short of providing a game plan.  Donald Mitchell and Carol Coles fill that void with this book, which earns its subtitle: Secrets of Continually Developing a More Profitable Business Model.<br />Although the authors base their recommendations on massive research, I commend them for presenting a highly readable book.  From the outset, they make their case using intriguing analogies, some hypothetical and others from case studies.  This is the only business book I've read that entertains and educates.  Readers will learn how to change their business models without wading through professional jargon.  My favorite stories revolved around a caddie who expanded his services to include vacation bookings for golfers, what happens when children want to develop their neighborhood lemonade stand into a franchise, and how a barber near Harvard University became a treasured resource for his clients.<br />As an entrepreneur who left management after twenty-three years to start his own business, I will refer to The Ultimate Competitive Advantage repeatedly.  Now I go beyond accepting that somebody \\"moved my cheese.\\"  Mitchell and Coles tell me how to produce my own cheese, in an ever-evolving assortment of flavors.<br />Whether your business resembles mine, starting seven years ago, or has lasted seventy years, you'll benefit from this well-organized, colorfully written how-to-excel book.  You will acquire a tremendous competitive advantage over your competition when you apply Mitchell and Coles' clearly stated guidelines.	2003-05-21

Her personal story will captivate you.  What she learned through her struggles will inspire you, and fortify you for those times when your immediate reaction tells you there is no hope, or even any reason to continue living.<br />Soap opera script writers might reject her account of her episodic life as too unbelievable.  Teenage bride and mother, young divorcee, uneducated, no financial resources-that's only the beginning.  After she courageously earned degrees and found a new life partner, tragedy struck again.  She lost her twenty-one year old son, through an accidental death on the oil rig where he worked.  Once more, she had to choose between despair and affirmation.  She chose affirmation.<br />I found this book uplifting.  The author shares her road map for moving successfully through life's irrational losses.  Written in warm, almost conversational style, All Is Not Lost will help you endure the sadness you have faced already-and prepare you for those discouraging events yet to come.<br />Do you want to help someone who is grieving, yet \\"don't have any idea what to say to them\\"?

Like many other development professionals, I was fairly aggressive in meeting people, remembering their names, and establishing rapport.  Annually, I filled my desk with business cards.<br />Now networking is even more important for me as an entrepreneur.  And in the last month, Bob Burg has given me valuable guidelines about networking.  He taught me that I was a dedicated networking novice, and showed me how to become a skilled professional.<br />First, I attended one of Bob's dynamic seminars in Atlanta, Georgia.  His novel-and highly creative-approach to networking prompted the audience members to think: \\"So. . .that's what I should have been doing all along.\\"<br />Then I read Endless Referrals, which reflected Bob's comments in the seminar, and added many other tips.

Yes, we were free to create dot/com companies, but we started too many of them.  Yes, we could expand TV networks from the original big three into many dozens, with most of the networks contributing little to our knowledge or culture, and with an entertainment level designed for easily satisfied viewers only.<br />Author Bob Burg wrote this book because of excesses he had encountered repeatedly in the professional world and in our interpersonal relations. For the last two decades at least, pop culture, and even management gurus, urged us to become more assertive and aggressive.  Who were our new heroes?  Corporate moguls like Jack Welch, Ted Turner, and Leona Helmsley-people who knew what they wanted, and got it, with little regard for what was happening to their employees.<br />Our language reflected the take-charge mantra:  \\"Be your own person.\\"  \\"Don't take anything off of anybody.\\"  \\"Lead, follow, or get out of the way.\\"  \\"Nice guys finish last.\\"<br />Burg's book, in my judgment, counters the \\"Me Generation,\\" by offering a radical change in our attitudes and habits.  The title reflects his theme-that, amazingly, we can win without intimidation, without one-upsmanship, without combat, without undermining others.<br />Bob Burg writes with the simple, clear style that made Hemingway so successful.  Besides using commonplace language, he illustrates his points clearly and compellingly.<br />The book begins with Burg's definition of winning, in direct contrast to our time-honored definition.  Then he takes us through a number of everyday scenarios, showing us how the softer and gentler approach accomplishes much more than our traditional \\"I'm gonna get that guy\\" strategy.<br />Everyone who reads this book will benefit.

Bite-Size Coaching for Success-Minded People	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Readers won't wait 52 weeks to finish this book!	I predict that very few readers will read this book as the format intended-one brief segment per week for fifty-two weeks.  Why?  Because the book is too interesting, relevant, and helpful.  Once you read the first \\"simple bite-size coaching\\" item, you won't be content to put the book aside. Most readers will read the entire book the first week, and then start reading again.<br />Ms. Sharbuno writes with exceptional clarity, wit, organization, and insight into everyday concerns and challenges.  Additionally, she has pulled together fifty-two marvelous quotations to segue into each short essay.<br />She explains her term \\"success from the inside out.\\"  To attain success, she advises, we cannot rely on outer circumstances.  Instead, success depends more upon how we use our inner resources, often in the face of a threatening environment.<br />The book is highly contemporary, in matters such as providing guidance for launching a new career after a job loss.  Readers will listen to her because she experienced that adversity herself, and transitioned happily into a new arena.<br />Likewise, when she talks about making your dreams come true, she explains how she achieved her fantasy of becoming a published writer.<br />Ms. Sharbuno counsels us on other important topics.  Examples: overcoming procrastination, the value of our \\"body wisdom\\" (which others might call \\"gut feelings\\"), dividing huge tasks into manageable pieces, adopting an attitude of abundance, and reshaping our attitudes.<br />52 Ways will make you think, laugh, and reassess yourself, and will prompt you to alter your personal and professional relationships.  I consider this book both practical and inspirational.  I'm sure you will, too.	2002-09-24

Readers will find that touring pros in the 1950s and 1960s weren't traveling in their private jets and wondering how to spend their millions. Many of them were sharing cars and hotel rooms, lacked sponsors, cared nothing about physical fitness, and had no swing gurus or sports psychologists to rescue them from slumps.<br /><br />Would you believe that tournament winners in those decades took home no more than $2,000? Did you know that not everyone who made the cut got a paycheck at the end of four days? Have you heard how players got on the tour before the advent of Q School?<br /><br />Tony Lema, unknown to many modern fans, was the perfect pro to tell this story. His personality comes across as strongly in print as it did on fairways and greens.<br /><br />You'll follow him as he makes his way onto the tour, sense his anxiety in the U.S. Open, feel the thrill of his runner-up finish at the Masters, and laugh at his candid descriptions of his playing partners, who acted more like fraternity brothers than fierce adversaries.<br /><br />When Lema died in a private plane crash in 1966, the golf world lost a superior player and a genuine character. You'll be grateful he left us this fascinating narrative about his career.[[ASIN:1577361334 The Complete Communicator: Change Your Communication-change Your Life!]]	2002-08-14

Sometimes that's the case--but not with this book.  To my delight, Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman live up to the hype surrounding their unique findings and proposals.<br /><br />My only regret is that First Break All the Rules wasn't around during the twenty-three years I spent in management. The authors would have saved me from more than a few serious blunders.  More importantly, I would have been able to maximize the people assets around me, far more effectively than I did.<br /><br />My favorite sentence: \\"It is better to work for a great manager in an old-fashioned company than for a terrible manager in a company offering an enlightened, employee-focused culture.\\"  Put another way, the manager a person works for personifies the company for that person.<br /><br />This reinforces what I hear from numerous groups I work with, who say their preferred way of receiving information from \\"higher up\\" is to have their immediate supervisor tell them.<br /><br />Some readers may be shocked because the authors don't take an egalitarian approach to management.  Yet most super coaches don't do that, either.  They identify the players who display extraordinary leadership potential and skills, and give them the bulk of their direction and support.<br /><br />Unlike other books that emerge from research pursuits, this one is readable.  Also, First Break All the Rules goes beyond theory, recommending practical action steps that will change organizations--and challenge their managers, as never before.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1577361334 The Complete Communicator: Change Your Communication-change Your Life!]]	2002-08-14
US	50633699	RDICNYLR15UD1	0738202878	426013411	Effective Communication Skills for Scientific and Technical Professionals	Books	5	17	19	N	N	Even rocket scientists have to communicate clearly	While dealing with scientific and technical professionals (STPs, he labels them) during his management career, Harry Chambers recognized that many of his colleagues were not able to share their expertise clearly enough, whether they were writing and speaking to their counterparts, or whether they were addressing people beyond their areas. So he wrote this book as a guideline for the STPs. I applaud Chambers' writing style--competent enough to please an educated audience, yet folksy enough to illustrate that stuffiness isn't required for explaining complicated ideas. The book underscores the widely accepted observation that people who get promoted because of their expertise may score very poorly when they try to manage a team. To equip STPs for management, Chambers offers advice about how to relate well to your boss, develop listening skills, serve customers, direct meetings, give and receive critism, and other vital topics. As a former university faculty member, I vote for placing this book in every campus library, and making it required reading for those pursuing the B.S. degree. To STPs who have their degrees already, I suggest that Effective Communication Skills for Scientific and Technical Professionals merits your close study. Although Chambers admits that &quot;becoming a highly skilled communicator is not easy,&quot; this book makes the assignment easier.	2001-12-12

Sometimes I patched them temporarily, yet I can't claim that I ever solved them.  Had this book been available to read and then discuss during staff retreats, I am confident that participants would have expressed their feelings more openly--and constructively--than they did under my leadership. I applaud what this book accomplishes with its homespun style.	2001-12-07

For me, this book has a simple message: Most of us have no reason to complain, not ever again.  If you can tie your shoes, go to the bathroom without assistance, walk outdoors on a beautiful day, hug your children, feed yourself, swing a golf club, cook a meal, take a deep breath--then count those blessings, and many others that physically able people enjoy. And I welcomed his comment that &quot;God doesn't make these things happen. . . .But where God comes in, where grace enters, is in the strength you find to deal with it.  You may not know where it comes from, but there's an enormous power at work.&quot;	2001-11-02

In some cases, the author never gets beyond obvious generalities, and in other cases the writer speaks as a theorist, not a practitioner. This book that escapes both of these drawbacks.In addition to drawing on her own managerial experience, she offers quotations and workable examples from 125 top leaders she interviewed.  Readers will welcome her creative, upbeat, sometimes bouncy style--unlike most books about business.  Sample:  She titles her section on communication \\"Ma Bell Did It.\\"<br />Managers will find dozens of suggestions they can use to bolster morale--leading to greater productivity and loyalty to the organization.  I wish I had read this book during my twenty-three years in management, so I endorse The High Cost of Low Morale enthusiastically.	2001-07-13

If you want to read a book that presents, in simple language, the contemporary approach to selling, then I recommend CLOSE MORE SALES.  The author: Mike Stewart, an international speaker, professional sales trainer and consultant, based in Atlanta.<br />Far from being an armchair advisor, Mike Stewart spent many years learning salesmanship as a professional sales person.  Additionally, he works with a variety of clients, training their sales professionals.<br />In the preface, he laments that &quot;Almost never are effective selling skills being taught.&quot;  With this book, he addresses that problem.  The book has the approval of the American Management Association, his publisher.  I recommend that you get a copy. . .and close more sales.	2001-02-20

Once I started reading, I wondered why the book wasn't widely known. LIFE IS SO GOOD reveals, with great poignancy, how an illiterate black man earned his living for most of a century--years of wandering, taking hard labor jobs, following the rules for survival in a white man's world. At an age when white boys were getting their favorite toys, he left home to work on a white man's farm. . .truly a hired &quot;hand,&quot; not acknowledged as a youngster who needed family, recreation, education, social development, and nurturing.  We follow George Dawson as he hoards the few dollars he earns, never complaining about his plight. Unable to decipher a newspaper, George is oblivious to the progress taking place around him--automobiles, modern appliances, jobs with fringe benefits.  He knows little about the historical and social revolutions permeating America.  Nevertheless, he survives--and remains content.  His greatest miracle, though, comes at age 98, when he learns to read. At this point, he starts to grasp what others have known all along. LIFE tugs at the reader's heartstrings.  We grieve as we consider all he missed in life, we rejoice at his delayed triumphs.  If you've ever considered yourself disadvantaged, read this book.  You'll be blessed by George Dawson's fortitude and gratitude.	2000-12-12

They had great words, wonderful music, and the voice of a musical master.  When I read Eddie's earlier book MY LIFE, MY LOVES, I  learned that his life had been far from a glorious fantasy.<br />Still, I  welcomed the astonishing music he gave to me, my dates, my life.  Today, I  still buy his tapes.<br />Reading this book did not diminish my respect for  him.  He was in Atlanta recently for a book signing, and I wished I could  be there--but I had an unavoidable professional conflict.<br />The book  displays a splendid mirror of life at the top.  Additionally, we see how  being at the top doesn't mean that you will stay there  automatically.<br />Some people grieve because Elvis died as a result of  drugs.  In many ways, the incredible career of Eddie Fisher suffered the  same fate. Fortunately, his body did not.<br />I welcomed the book's overall  message--that no matter how badly a person squanders his God-given talents  and hurts others, as long as life remains there are opportunites for  rebuilding--and reconciliation.<br />Eddie Fisher was the greatest singer of  my teenage generation.  Through this book, he has become the greatest  symbol of personal resuscitation for those who have failed  dramatically.<br />This book should be required reading for anyone entering  drug rehabilitation.<br />Thank you, Eddie, for all the music, and for a book  that sings with triumph!<br />Wish you were here!	1999-12-04
