All of the examples in this book are in C#.  This book is sometimes very confusing especially starting in Chapter 5 - Manipulating XML with DOM.  Some of the chapters must be read a couple of times in order to make sense and this book is somewhat difficult to read.<br />In Chapter 1 - Introduction to .Net and XML, Chapter 2 - Reading XML, Chapter 3 - Writing XML, and Chapter 4 - Reading and Writing Non-XML Formats establish a basic foundation.  The more advanced subjects start in Chapter 5.<br />Here is a synopis of Chapters 5 through Chapter 11.<br />Chapter 5 - Manipulating XML with DOM<br />Chapter 6 - Navigating XML with XPath<br />Chapter 7 - Transforming XML with XPath<br />Chapter 8 - Constraining XML with Schemas<br />Chapter 9 - SOAP and XML Serialization<br />Chapter 10 - XML and Web Services<br />Chapter 11 - XML and Databases<br />The author provides a quick reference in chapters 13 through chapter 20 but needs an entire chapter (Chapter 12) to explain how to use the quick references.<br />Pros:  The author covers just about every facet of XML in this book.  The author provides 4 examples of using the memory stream for I-O.  Other books that I have read just mention it briefly but did not provide examples.  There are ample examples in this book.<br />Cons:  This book is sometimes hard to read and can be confusing at times.  You may have to read the chapters several times to make sense of the material.  On page 12, the author states that &quot;the simplest thing you can do with an existing XML document is to read it into memory&quot;.  Shouldn't it be &quot;read from memory&quot; and &quot;write to memory&quot;?  I may be wrong but this line confuses me everytime I read it.  Like all O'Reilly books, the font used is very small and makes reading difficult.<br />Overall this is a good book for the intermediate to advanced C# developers who have a strong working knowledge of C# and .Net but for less experienced developers or Visual Basic developers with no knowledge of C#, this book may be confusing.  This is definitely NOT a beginner book.iate to advanced C# developers who have a strong working knowledge of C# and .Net but for less experienced developers or Visual Basic developers with no knowledge of C#, this book may be confusing.

This is one of those books.  This book targets the intermediate Visual Basic.Net developer but someone trying to learn Visual Basic.Net, ASP.Net, ADO.Net, or XML will find that this book is easy to read.  Chapters 1 through 10 cover ASP.Net, Chapter 11 covers XML, and Chapter 12 covers ADO.Net. At the end of several chapters, the authors provide a mini-reference.  For example, at the end of chapter 11, there is a mini-reference on XML.  I use these mini-references on a daily basis. In each chapter the authors have ample examples.  The amazing thing is that they all work.  I followed every example and with a minor exception of 1 example in the XML Chapter, all of the examples worked.  The one exception just required some minor adjustments (using the XML indentation method).  This is my first book by Jeffery P. McManus and Chris Kinsman but it won't be the last.  I plan to buy their equivalent book on C#.  I would also buy any &quot;advanced&quot; books that the authors write.<br />Pros:  Easy to read, ample examples that work, and mini-references at the end of the chapters.<br />Cons: I would like to see more illustrations in the book.<br />This book is definitely a &quot;Buy&quot;.	2003-11-13

When I read this book, I quickly became bored.  I already know how to save a file to the hard drive so why waste my time reading about it. In Chapter 1 through 4 the authors explain the various features of Visio and explain the basics of Visio, such as creating a diagram, adding shapes to a diagram, formatting shapes and diagrams, and connecting the shapes.  I did learn some new tricks in these chapters.  In Chapters 5 through 9, the authors try to teach you how to use Visio for a specific solution.  For example in Chapter 5, the Authors instruct you on Creating Project Schedules.  Some advanced features are explained in Chapter 10 which is the last chapter in the book.<br />Pros:  The authors do give you some useful tips and if you follow the examples you will learn Visio in a hurry.  The color illustrations are excellent (with the exception of the appendix at the end of the book).<br />Cons:  The authors assume you just bought your PC yesterday and the early chapters in the book are too basic for any experienced developer. The shapes in Appendix B are not legible. The 30-day demo did not load on my Windows XP machine.	2003-11-04
US	49614641	R226QDBJMB1QEQ	1893115267	548628279	Visual Basic .NET and the .NET Platform: An Advanced Guide	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Good overall coverage but needs more detailed info	This is a good book for the intermediate-to-advanced programmers making the switch to Visual Basic.Net from Visual Basic 6.  Please NOTE: This is not a beginner book. The book provides a good overall coverage of most of the Visual Basic.Net topics but this book needs to be augmented with books that are more specific to the programming needs of the developer.  For example, if the developer is going to develop Web forms in ASP.NET using Visual Basic.Net, they should buy a books that specifically written for that purpose. Overall,this is a 4-star book and I liked it well enough that I am going to buy Troelsen's \\"C# and the .Net Platform, Second Edition\\".<br />A couple of minor issues with this book.<br />1. Andrew Troelsen wrote \\"C# and the .Net Platform\\" first and it appears that he used the manuscript for that book to write this book.  Several times in the book, the examples are in C#, not Visual Basic!  See page 107. The editors failed to catch these errors.<br />2. Not including the index, this book is 1017 pages and that is divided up into 16 chapters.  The average chapter is about 63 or 64 pages long.  It seems that some of the chapters drag on and on and on.<br />3. There is very little cohesiveness between the examples in the chapters.  In Chapter 4 (Object-Oriented Programming with VB.Net), each example does not build off of the previous example.  Troelsen starts with an Employee example but finishes the chapter with a Car example.  If you trying to follow along with his examples, you end up with several \\"Solutions\\" or \\"Projects\\" that are not related.	2003-08-30
US	49614641	R1XCIUT67WO5TG	1861007191	585295202	Fast Track ASP.NET	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Fast Track ASP.NET	I purchased this book and Fast Track C# together and I was not disappointed with either book.<br />Pros:<br />The Fast Track C# book is targeted to Java and C++ developers making the transition to C# and the Fast Track ASP.Net C# Edition is targeted to ASP 3.0 programmers making the transition to ASP.Net.  Even though I have limited ASP 3.0 experience, the book was easy to follow and I did not feel lost. When you have multiple authors, the difference in writing styles can sometimes be very obvious but that is not the case with Bellinaso, Gaster, and Hoffman.  Their writing styles blend together.  It was hard to distinguish where 1 author finished up and another started.  Each chapter in this book builts upon the knowledge of the previous chapters.  If you have some ASP and/or .Net skills you might want to skip the 1st (What is ASP.Net?) chapter.  The authors show the results of the source code.  If you do the examples, you can compare your results to the authors. A lot of books show you the source code but never show you the results.  How can you know if you are doing it right, if you do not have the results to compare it with?  Wrox recommends that this book or the &quot;Beginning ASP.Net using C#&quot; be followed with more advanced or specialized books.  This book will give the basic skills to successfully write ASP.Net using C#.  I would follow Wrox's advice and supplement this book with more advanced books.  This is an excellent starting book and will get you up to speed with ASP.Net using C# in a hurry!  I highly recommend this book.<br />Cons:<br />If you use a highligher, it may &quot;bleed&quot; through several pages before or after the page that you highlighted.  This really makes a messy book.  Did anyone else experience this?	2003-06-05

The entire &quot;Fast Track&quot; series from Wrox were written to help you learn a subject fast and this is especially helpful if your employer decides to convert to C# or any other .Net technology or language.  I purchased both Fast Track C# and Fast Track ASP.NET C# Edition together.  I am impressed with both books.  The Fast Track C# book is 413 pages and the chapters are not to long.  This makes the reading very easy and the chapters don't take weeks to read.  The book starts out with the basics of .NET and C# and then progresses to more advanced C# subjects.  Note: The authors do not go into great detail on the various subjects and you should augment this book with a more advanced books on C#. There are ample examples but the authors do not provide the &quot;results&quot;.  This is a book for the intermediate developer making the conversion from Java or C++ but I think Visual Basic 6 developers will benefit from this book.<br />In Chapter 1 - Overview of .Net and the CLR (Common Language Runtime), the authors explain the fundamentals of .Net.<br />Chapter 2 - Introduction to C#, Chapter 3 - C# Basics, and Chapter 4 - Object-Oriented Features of C# provide the basics that you will need to know about C#.  If you are coming from Visual Basic.Net, you might want to skip over these chapters but I read these chapters twice.<br />The authors explain the more advanced features of C# in Chapters 5 - Advanced C#, 6 - .NET Programming with C#, and 7 - Working with the .Net Base Class. These chapters will help you get beyond the &quot;Hello World&quot; type of applications.  These chapters provide some real-world examples.<br />In Chapter 8 - Building Windows Applications, the authors explain all of the basics to windows development.  The GUI or the presentation layer is what the end-user will be most familar with.<br />The next chapters will help you with real-world applications that you may encounter.<br />Chapter 9 - Assemblies and ILDASM.<br />Chapter 10 - Data Access with ADO.Net<br />Chapter 11 - COM and COM+ Interoperability<br />Chapter 12 - ASP.Net<br />Chapter 13 - Web Servicesat you may encounter.<br />Chapter 9 - Assemblies and ILDASM.  <BR>Chapter 10 - Data Access with ADO.Net<BR>Chapter 11 - COM and COM+ Interoperability<BR>Chapter 12 - ASP.Net<BR>Chapter 13 - Web Services	2003-04-05

This is a good book for Visual Basic developers who want to make the conversion to C# or for the beginner. Like all Dummies series, there are ample examples and the author does a great job of explaining the C# language. Windows forms are covered in Chapter 17 and 18 but there is no discussion about Web development or using C# with Active Server Pages (ASP).<br />Starting in Chapter 6 (Collecting Data - The Class and the Array) there are several really annoying errors, for example, on page 105 the author uses &quot;for (int i = 0; i &lt; 11; i++)&quot; to iterate thru a 10 element array.  In the section below this (Array bounds checking), the author uses exactly the same code and says this will fail.  The first code should be &quot;for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)&quot;. These errors are scattered through out the book.  Still this is a good book and I would highly recommend it.	2003-02-19

You will not find any help on the ABC Templates or using OOP.  This book does have quite a few errors but since reference material for Clarion is very rare, you must overlook them. This book will not help solve any real world issues that you may encounter but may help with some minor issues or how-to-do things. I spent 6 1/2 years developing with Clarion and everyday seemed to be a headache but I am thankful for the \\"For Dummies\\" people (Tom Moseley and Jim Defabia) for writing this book.

Don't get me wrong, I highly recommend all three books for the developer who is coming from Visual Basic 6 or another language.  The illustrations in this book are excellent and the author has done a great job writing this book.  I did NOT find very many errors, but I have not read any books that did not have any errors.  A few errors is expected.  This book is one of several 5-star books that Robert Oberg has written and the editing is very good.  This book was so very good that I plan to purchase other Robert Oberg books dealing advanced Visual Basic.Net and C# programming.

The screen shots at the bottom of each page have been reduced to the point where they are hard to read.  Since C# is a new programming language, it appears that the authors did not know C# as well as they should have or the publisher was in a hurry to get this book to market. When Visual Studio.Net was in the beta, a lot of companies tried to saturate the market with C#, Visual Basic, ASP, and ADO books. This book is not up to par with the usual Maran Graphics high quality. Your dollars would be be wisely spent elsewhere. I would recommend Robert Oberg's \\"Introduction to C# using .Net\\" instead. Hopefully the authors and publisher of this book are working on a \\"Second edition\\" to correct the issues.

My, how time flies! Mark was the at the peak of his career when his life was snuffed out in a race car crash.  Mark Donohue and Roger Penske completely revitalized autoracing and changed everybody's thinking about how to run a successful auto racing team.  Mark and Roger took auto racing to new levels of professionalism. Gone were the days of t-shirts and oily blue jeans, replaced by clean uniforms.  Gone were the days of hamburgers and french fries, replaced with healthy food for the crew.  Gone were the days of towing of the race car on an open trailer pulled by a rusty old pickup truck, replaced by semi-trailer trucks.  His book &quot;The Unfair Advantage&quot; should be manditory reading for any race car driver or business professional. If you expect to get a head in the game of life, you should read this book.	2002-12-05

Although color photography has been around for a while, it wasn't until the mid 1960s that the average joe could afford 35 mm color cameras.

As a matter of fact, I would recommend several books and C# is no exception. C# is a new programming language and it will take several books to be proficient with it. When you use several authors from different publishers, you get a better understanding of that subject. Jesse Liberty's book \\"Learning C#\\" is a good primer for the novice developer or to a person who knows a little bit about Visual Basic 6.0. For a more experienced developer I would recommend several other books such as Jesse Liberty's \\"Programming C#\\".<br />Pros:<br />There are ample examples in every chapter to demonstrate the principles the author is trying to convey.  The important changes are highlighted in bold.  This makes for easy reading. Jesse Liberty tries to cover all of the basics and then some. This book was published after the initial release of Visual Studio.Net, so you do not get the errata associated books that were published during the beta.<br />Cons:<br />The readers of this book (Learning C#) will find that it is not a good book if you want to learn how to program C# for Windows or Web applicatons. Approximately 90% of this book covers \\"console\\" applications. Jesse tries to explain that the fundamentals of C# are best learned if the user does not have the extra baggage that Windows or Web development have but I have to question how much \\"real-world\\" development is done using console mode. The author skims over the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and the very first application is actually created using Notepad. The basics of the IDE are covered in Chapter 4. In Chapter 10, the author uses the IDE to demonstrate debugging. Some of the screen shots (which are in Chapters 4, 10, 12, and 16) of the IDE are hard to read. Not impossible to read, just hard to read. They have been reduced down in size to the point that someone without perfect vision will have a hard time reviewing these screen prints. In chapter 3 (Object-Oriented Programming), the author states that the 3 pillars of OOP are encapsulation, specialization, and polymorphism. The other books that I have read call these encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism respectively. In chapter 11, the author does some back-tracking and substitutes inheritance for specialization.<br />Overall this is book is good but it could be better. I would also recommend several other books including Robert Orberg's \\"Introduction to C# using .Net\\" and Klaus Michelsen's \\"C# Primer Plus\\". With all three books, you will get a solid foundation for C# and then you could go on to the more advanced C# books.screen prints.

Although Lotus wasn't the first rear-engine race car in Indianapolis 500 (Jack Brabham did it in 1961 with a Cooper-Climax), the Lotus was the most successful of the mid-1960's marques.  Jim Clark won the the 1965 Indianapolis 500 and the Lotus he drove was the first rear-engine race car to win the race.  The &quot;Old Guard&quot; was upset that they got beat by a Green car but soon everyone either had a Lotus or a Lotus clone.  In addition to winning the Indianapolis 500 in 1965, Jim Clark finished 2nd in the 1963 and 1966 races.	2002-11-27

If you believe everything the author writes about the Indy 500 in this book, he would have you believing the 1973 running of the race should be last.  It is now 2002 and while the Indy 500 is not the same great race it used to be, it is still around.  The practice and the race in 1973 was one of the worst in the history of the Indianpolis 500.  Two drivers (Art Pollard and Swede Savage) and a mechanic died in horrendous crashes.  Another driver (David &quot;Salt&quot; Walther) had severe burns in a first lap crash that sent several spectators to the hospital as well.  The author is stating his opinion that we should do away with the Indianapolis 500 and all racing in particular. The Indianapolis Motor Speedway made major changes to the track after the 1973 race.  Although racing will always be a dangerous sport, I do not feel that most people go to the races to see crashes.  They go to see close side-by-side racing amoung the best drivers in the world, whether it be the Indianapolis 500, Daytona 500, or the U.S. Nationals.	2002-11-15

This book will help you achieve that goal. When you finish this book, not only will you be able to create web pages but you will be able to include pictures.

The earlier chapters in this the book cover Data Access Objects (DAO). Although there is lots of legacy code that uses DAO/RDO (Remote Data Objects), you will find most Visual Basic development shops may have converted to ActiveX Data Objects (ADO). ADO is covered in the later chapters but it is 2.1. The current version of ADO is 2.7. DAO/RDO/ADO are the \\"bridges\\" between a database and Visual Basic applications.<br />For a developer who is going to be supporting Visual Basic 6.0 and ADO 2.5 or later then this is a good starting point in database programming using Visual Basic 6.0. This book covers Microsoft Access and small amount of SQL Server. There is very little discussion about other databases such as Oracle. I combined this book and John Smiley's \\"Learn to Program Visual Basic Databases\\" to give me a solid foundation on databases, ADO, and Visual Basic.<br />I would recommend \\"Beginning SQL Server 2000 for Visual Basic Developers\\" or \\"Beginning Visual Basic SQL Server 7.0\\" by Thearon Willis (both from Wrox) for developers who need to use SQL Server and Visual Basic 6.  These books are both excellent and will augment this book.	2002-10-23

Microsoft wants you to think that everyone will be switching to Visual Basic.Net but the reality is there are a lot of Visual Baisc 6.0 shops out there and they have to support legacy COM components (ActiveX) for some time to come.  Not all of those components are going to be converted to .Net.  This book is a good starting point for any Visual Basic developers who want to learn COM including ActiveX DLLs and EXEs, ActiveX Controls, and Microsoft Transaction Server.  The chapter on Microsoft Transaction Server could be a good step to COM+ on Windows 2000 and XP machines. Thomas Lewis takes you step-by-step from introduction to COM thru ActiveX components and finally thru Microsoft Transaction Server.  He lays a good knowledge foundation and then with each succeeding chapter builds upon that knowledge. I would recommend that after you read this book that you follow it up the Peter Vogel's &quot;Visual Basic Object and Component Handbook&quot;.	2002-10-22

This book is an example of that.  There are 2 editions for this book, one is based on the Beta 2 and the other on the initial release of Visual Studio.Net (1.0).  The Beta book has several noticeable errors and the editing was a rush job. Some of the examples resemble the on-line help and may be screen shots from the on-line help.  The on-line help has improved tremendously since the Beta. The 2nd edition has corrected most of those errors and the editor has done a higher quality job.  The chapters on disconnected databases (Chapters 9 thru 12) and XML (Chapter 22) are very good for understanding some of the new features of ADO.Net. Microsoft made several changes to ADO.Net and Visual Basic.Net while these products were Beta, so you want to buy the 2nd edition only.  The Beta book may mislead you on several key issues.	2002-10-22

I combined this book, James D. Foxall's \\"MCSD in a Nutshell\\", and the Transcender courses to pass the 70-175 exam. I would never recommend just 1 or 2 books to learn a programming language or study for the certification exams.  The more you read, the better you'll understand.<br />The chapters on internet development, Active Server Pages, and IIS were of little help. I did not have any questions on my exam dealing with these subjects so I felt that reading this chapter was a waste of my time. If it had not been for this chapter I would have given the book 5 stars. There are some minor mistakes and/or typos in this book but overall it is a very good resource. You should read this book starting about 1 week before you take the exam. Good Luck with your exams.	2002-10-22

Everyone was saying that this was a great book, so when I gave this book only 1 star, I took alot of heat from people who think that \\"Dan's the Man!!\\".  I decided to review this book again.  This is my second review and my result is still the same.  Dan may be the guru of Visual Basic but he cannot communicate those thoughts into written words.  Don't get me wrong, Dan knows how to talk and this book is full of talk, but talk is not teaching nor will talk help you master the advanced subjects such as COM.  In this book, Dan starts to tell you about subject, then he goes off on a tangent.  Sooner or later, he might return to the subject.  The cartoons in the book have a striking resemblance to \\"Bevis and Butthead\\".  That is a scary thought!  Bevis and Butthead becoming software developers and then writing a book about it.  The cheap sales pitches for software that his company sells should have been put into an appendix.  This book is a very large book (800+ pages) but if you cut out the cartoons and all of the talk, this book would be 1/2 of it's size. I recommend Peter Vogel's book \\"Visual Basic Object and Component Handbook\\" instead. Dan is a very smart man but that does not mean he is a great author.	2002-10-21

This book and the Transcender courses help me pass both exams (70-176 Designing and Implementing Desktop Applications using Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 and 70-175 Designing and Implementing Distributed Applications using Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0). Please note: I used about 6 or 7 books as study guides.<br />Material in all of the chapters could or will be on the either exam but pay attention to Chapter 13 - Packaging and Deploying an Application and Chapter 14 Visual SourceSafe and the Visual Component Manager. My exams had an overwhelming number of questions about these subjects.<br />The author indicates at the beginning of each chapter what material is covered on each of the exams. With the exception of Chapter 12 (Creating Microsoft Transaction Server Components), I found the material in every chapter could be on either exam. Regardless of which exam you are going to take, if you read the chapters religiously, you will be prepared for whatever questions that are on either exam. When you combine this book with the Transcender courses, you will pass the exams. Good Luck!	2002-10-17

You will need to have a through understanding of these in order to pass the exam. This book gives the basics but does not go in to great detail on these subjects. I would recommend James D. Foxall's \\"MCSD in a Nutshell\\" and the Transcender courses if you are really serious about your certification. Visual Basic 6.0 is still the main development environment at many companies. You want the best training and education you can get. This book is about average. This book is OK if you use it as a supplemental book to the other study guides.	2002-10-17

When I was studying for the exams, I used about 6 or 7 books including this one. This book is OK if you use it as a supplemental to all of your other study guides. If you use this book as your single source of study for the 70-176 exam, you will probably fail. Only about 60-70% of material in this book is on the test.<br />There are several errors in the practice questions at the end of the chapters and in the practice test at the end of the book.<br />I would recommend James D. Foxall's \\"MCSD in a Nutshell\\" (See my review of that book) and the Transcender courses as you primary study guides.	2002-10-17
US	49614641	R27AAC1Q0V6SET	1893115194	615130938	Serious ADO: Universal Data Access with Visual Basic	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Good ADO Book for Visual Basic 6.0	This is a good book that explains the intimate details of ADO but the format of book leaves a little to be desired.  On most pages the 3/4 of the page has the text and the left 1/4 of each page is blank or contains subheadings.  There is no clear-cut separation between 1 subject and the next.  While reading this book, if you do not pay close attention, the subject will change. The author clearly knows ADO and how to apply it to Visual Basic 6.0 but it appears that he repeats the text in several parts of the book especially in chapter 3 - RecordSets with SQL Data Sources.  Maybe it was my imagination but several times I had a sense of Deju-Vu.  Didn't I read about this earlier in the book?  Chapter 4, 5, and 7 (Explicit Connections, Explicit Commands, and Disconnected RecordSets) are very good and you will want to read these chapters religously. Installation of the files on the CD caused some problems on my PC, which has Windows XP Home Edition.  If you like Shakespeare, you'll like the examples in this book.  Beware the Index is not in synchronization with the actual page numbers.	2002-10-16

Don't be fooled by \\"for Dummies\\" in the title, Bill Hatfield does a great job of teaching you the basic of ASP.Net amd then some.  In the first couple of chapters, I learned several tricks to ASP.Net.  For example, I didn't know that my ISP could provide me with a Web page that could run ASP.Net.  When Bill mentioned it in his book, I checked with my ISP and found that it was true.  I thought that I had to have IIS installed on my PC in order to run ASP.  For people with Windows XP Home Edition that means upgrading to the XP Professional and that [costs a lot].  None of the other ASP books that I have purchased mentioned this.  When you finish this book you will not feel like a dummy any more.  The chapters are relatively short and I read the first 3 chapters in the first sitting.  Bill Hatfield really knows ASP and this is his second book (ASP 3.0 for Dummies) that has obtained 4 or 5 stars. This is the first book you want to buy on ASP.Net.  Then you can follow it up with the more advanced books on ASP.Net of your choice.  The cartoons in the \\"Dummies\\" series really help to relieve the stress of studying.	2002-10-11

Sometimes it is better than the on-line help. I would supplement this book with the \\"Visual Basic.Net: The Complete Reference\\" book. I would highly recommend that both books be added to your Visual Basic.Net reference library. Although not as fast as the on-line help, the book provides better answers to your Visual Basic.Net questions.  The only error that I found is ADO.Net becomes ADO.Next in the chapter on ADO.Net.  Must have been the publisher.	2002-10-11

Every type of object or component is examined in this book and very well explained in a way to make you understand. Peter Vogel's writting style makes reading this book easy.<br />This book was a major study guide for the Designing and Implementing Desktop Applications using Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 (exam 70-176) and the Designing and Implementing Distributed Applications using Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 (exam 70-175). I passed both exams. This was an excellent addendum to the Transcender courses and I use this book several times a week as a reference. There are a lot of Visual Basic 6.0 shops out there and I would highly recommend that this book be part of their reference library.<br />The author is suppose to be writing a Visual Basic.Net Object and Component Handbook which is due out next year. If that book is as good as this book, I will highly recommend it too.  I have about 30 Visual Basic books and this book is one of the best.	2002-10-10

When I started this book, I felt that I did not know anything about COM+.  When I finished this book, my skill set was at an intermediate level.  This book is well written and I read this book from cover-to-cover.  VB developers coming from a n-tier environment that used MTS may find this book a little too basic but for developer with little or no experience with MTS will find this book useful in learning COM+.	2002-10-10

I own 4 other books written by John Smiley (Learn to Program Visual Basic 6 series) and none of them have been a disappointment. This book is a good as the other Visual Basic books.<br />It is true that John can teach anyone how to program. I thought that this book would be too simple for me but once I started it I could not put it down. Yeah, a lot of reviewers say he talks too much but I find myself part of the conversation and that is sometimes refreshing in itself. There is one minor problem with this conversation: sometimes the book will go several paragraphs without saying anything about VB.Net. As a VB 6.0 developer hoping to learn VB.Net, I found this book to be an excellent starting point. If you follow along with the examples, you will have an excellent foundation for Visual Basic.Net development.	2002-10-10

Robert Vieira definitely knows SQL Server. I also have his Professional SQL Server 7.0 Programming book. I have read his 2 books religiously from cover-to-cover.<br />The first 12 chapters of this book provide a solid foundation in SQL Server 2000 but Vieira augments those chapters with some advanced thinking. Chapter 12 - Stored Procedures is probably the heart of the book and this chapter is one of the best in the book. I have read this chapter several times and learned something new every time.<br />Chapter 13 through Chapter 18 contain advanced SQL Server 2000 features and Vieira does an outstanding job explaining them. I found a lot of questions on the exam came from those chapters.<br />Chapters 19 and 20 are concerned XML and how this technology is constantly changing. The author does an outstanding job of explaining XML.<br />The chapters toward the end of the book are concerned with advanced features that an administrator might need to know but the knowledge is helpful in my employment and I use DTS almost every other day. In order to comprehend SQL Server 2000, these chapters should definitely be read. That would have been impossible without Chapters 21 through 31. This book rates as a 5-star in my book and I highly recommend this to any serious SQL Server developer and/or administrator. I will also be using this book for the 70-228 exam.	2002-10-10

I used this book and Robert Vieira's Professional SQL Server 2000 Programming (Also by Wrox) to study for the Designing and Implementing Databases using Microsoft SQL Server 2000 exam (70-229).  The 2 chapters on XML were especially good.  Thearon does his best work when he works solo and this book is one of his best. I have his SQL Server 7 book and both books are well-written. I really like the &quot;Hardware Tracking&quot; tutorial that he follows for most of the book.  This tutorial will also help with your Visual Basic skills.  I have learned several new VB tricks just by following along.  I hope that Thearon writes a Beginning SQL Server 2000 for Visual Basic.Net Developers.	2002-10-10

Another bad book from Dan	This is the second Dan Appleman book that I have reviewed (the other being \\"Developing Com/Activex Components With Visual Basic 6\\").  In both books, Dan starts to tell you about something and then he goes off on some tangent and starts talking about something else.  Maybe he will get back to the original subject. This is like debugging spaghetti code, only this is Dan's writing style.  It is very hard to follow and very frustrating.  Not all of Dan's books are like this.  I did not buy this book and when a friend asked me to review it, I was a little leary.  Dan's book about API is very good.  I was hoping for better from Dan. Too much talk.

The chapters on OOP (Chapters 4 - Classes and Objects and 5 - Inheritance and Interfaces) are very long. Chapter 4, 5 and 6 (Event Handling and Delegates)form the heart of this book, but I would have broken them down into smaller chapters. The information in those chapters provide a good introduction to OOP. At times, I felt the authors were hard to follow and found myself re-reading several pages especially in Chapters 4 and 5. Overall this book probably is about 3 1/2 stars. I am hoping that in the next release of this book that the authors would follow their own advice and break the chapters down into smaller parts. ...	2002-10-10
