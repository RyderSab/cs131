However, I was delightfully surprised with &quot;Pride, Prejudice and Jasmin Field&quot;.  It was a little slow-going at first but I soon began to enjoy the paralleling stories of the real characters vs. the characters they were playing in a stage production of the original Jane Austen classic.  Some people may find it somehow intellectually offensive for a writer to use such a format but I honestly found it to be a very entertaining and heart-warming read.  The book has even prompted me to re-read the original, it having been close to 30 years since I have done so.	2002-10-30

I was not disappointed.<br />Plain Truth is a very well-written story about the mystery surrounding the birth and almost immediate death of a baby in the barn of an Amish farm.  It is a fascinating story as the reader accompanies the Philadelphia lawyer chosen to defend the young mother accused of killing her own baby.<br />It is a fascinating story, well-researched and, in my opinion, fairly and honestly written in terms of comparing the lives of the \\"plain\\" Amish to those in the outside world.  It is, perhaps, a fraction too long but well worth the read to discover the ultimate truth to the mystery.	2002-10-24

In a most entertaining and fluid manner she tells the two stories of Ana and Bee, half-sisters who have missed out on the opportunity of ever truly knowing each other well - that is, until one of them dies and the other sets out to unravel the mystery of her death and the little-known life she had prior to it.  This book, in the broadest sense, belongs in the genre of other contemporary British women writers who are currently experiencing such a widespread appeal.  However, it has a depth and emotion to it that marks it apart and above most of the others.	2002-10-08

This is the story of a marriage turned sour due to infidelity and the effects that its breakdown has on the couple's two children.  The story is told through the eyes of the four main characters, namely the two parents and the two children.  This made for four totally different perspectives on the situation but, for me, the book tended to plod along at a similar pace throughout with no particular highs and lows.  Its an easy read but not, in my opinion, up to the standard that I had experienced before in the author's previous novel, &quot;Love is a Four Letter Word&quot;.	2002-10-03

When Ingrid is jailed for murder, so starts the long and rocky journey of Astrid as she moves from foster home to foster home.  Few people will go through in their entire lifetimes what this child experiences throughout her early teenage years.  Her journey is difficult but the author keeps her readers engrossed until the very end.  This is a wonderful book and I sincerely hope the upcoming movie does it true justice.	2002-09-11

Despite the fact that Dig and Nadine have been best friends since school, they simply can't see what is so obviously staring them right in the face - the fact that they are made for each other.  It takes a decade of meaningless dating, the return of former paramours into their lives and plenty of cross-wired communication before their fate can be sealed.  Its a while since I read &quot;Ralph's Party&quot; by the same author but I think I actually preferred &quot;Thirty Nothing&quot;.

Xavier Big is an absurdly rich and totally out-of-touch with reality American whose devotion to his dead Irish mammy borders on the psychotic.  When he decides (and publicly announces) that he must marry a good Irish girl that mother would be proud of, you can imagine what chaos ensues in every county of Ireland.  Married or unmarried, every red-haired Irish lassie thinks she stands a chance.  There are lots of well-written characters in this book, some of whom you will like and some of whom will make you grind your teeth!  But its a fun read and I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it.	2002-08-18

Whilst the main plot line is that of Cathy Scarlet and her friend Tom Feather and their fledgling catering company, there are plenty of other things going on in the lives of their many family members, friends and work collegues.  This book has certainly sparked my interest to read more of Maeve Binchy's books.	2002-07-23

As others have written, this book takes you by surprise in that it is very hard to actually like or empathise in anyway with the main character.  Katie Castle has very few endearing qualities - she is egotistical, self-centred, cares for nobody but herself .. but somehow the author, Rebecca Campbell, keeps the reader hanging in there wanting to know what becomes of Katie.  She has it all - career, recognition in the fashion industry, a fiance who adores her - and yet, through her own selfishness, she throws it all away.  How she regains her life is what kept me reading and whilst I'm still not sure that I actually like her, I did enjoy the book and would go on to read more by Rebecca Campbell in the future.	2002-06-17

The two story lines parallel each other for much of the book but they do inevitably intertwine towards the end.  The book is funny and, for me, it was just the remedy I needed to drag myself out of a reading slump - it definitly kick-started my reading juices.	2002-06-04

It the very funny look at the 8 year old marriage of Clara, a woman in her 30s, and the mother of two small boys.  She has started to doubt whether in fact she is as happy as she has always assumed she is.  She is surrounded by a very colourful cast of characters, both friends and family.  Clara has always had some self-image problems but until now hasn't realised that her life in general is not quite so picture perfect.  My only criticism of this book is that it wasn't long enough.  India Knight writes both with wit and compassion and draws together a wonderful array of people who I think could have been expanded upon greatly into a much longer novel - more like a Marian Keyes novel, in fact.  But if you like reading about British singletons, you'll enjoy this story about what can happen after they have met their Mr Rights and settled into marriage and parenthood.	2002-03-25

But where &quot;Catching Alice&quot; takes a different path is that this heroine takes the opportunity to move to Los Angeles under the wing of her old American schoolfriend who has a good heart but is one of life's shallower creatures.  Alice lands herself a pretty good job in PR (the Californians can't resist the British accent) and so begins her new life in la-la-land.   This books contains lots of characters and plot lines and is really quite a lot of fun.  Its a quick, light-hearted read, doesn't pretend to be anything greater and takes an amusing look at what happens when people are transplanted to a new culture and environment.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.	2002-03-23

The story in broad terms is quite extraordinary and eye-opening.  However, there were several sections of the book which just didn't quite ring true.  For example, her initial (solo) arrival in London as a young illiterate teenage who spoke no English and who until 24 hours before had never seen a flush toilet or an airplane.  There is simply no way that she could have gone through Heathrow arrivals without any questioning.  She would not have had any clue how to navigate her way from the plane, through immigration and customs etc.  All I am saying is, that I believe there were many embellished stories in this book.<br />However, the book did serve one very important purpose - drawing attention to the abominable practice of female genital mutilation.  Waris Dirie now works with the United Nations to stop this atrocity and if her story can help achieve this goal in any small way, then this book has achieved its purpose.	2002-03-15

Its one to put on the side table or on the edge of the bathtub and read a little at a time.  Its basically Miss Manners re-written for the 2002 single career girl.  For some people its advice will just be common sense and what they have already learned from their mothers and from experience.  For others, it contains a good range of social and work environment etiquette that is sadly lacking these days.  I was a little taken in by the cover and title and unfortunately did not find it as amusing as I thought it might have been.  However, I did still find it quite readable.	2002-03-13

Admittedly, it is light and frothy but it is pure escapist fun that will keep you entertained from beginning to end.  Aspiring writer Anna is at a loose end both in terms of her career and love life when she takes a job as a personal assistant (that should read nanny!) for the totally atrocious Cassandra, writer of erotic romance novels, wife of a has-been rock star and mother of Zak who should be renamed Damian.  What follows is a non-stop adventure of Anna's daily trials and tribulations including her romance with the handsome laird of a Scottish castle.  This is not world-class literature (and doesn't pretend to be).  Some of the characters are outrageously over the top but the book wouldn't be half as much fun if they weren't.  Those reviewers who have given this book one-star ratings and scathing comments really need to lighten up a little.  Readers also need to stop trying to equate all contemporary British women writers with Helen Fielding and Bridget Jones.  Bridget is Bridget and why should any of these other heroines pretend to be.  Try Bad Heir Day for yourself, sit back, relax and just have a ton of fun.	2002-03-05

In the first book, &quot;One Pair of Hands&quot;, the author tells of her time pre-World War II working as a cook-general in various homes around London.  Considering that she was born into wealth and privilege, work was not even necessary for this debutante but she had a drive to go out into the working world and to experience life.  That book was very funny and well worth the read.<br />However, in this second installment Dickens outlines her first-year training as a nurse during the war.  I'm afraid that I just couldn't get into it as I did with the first book.  Maybe the more serious side of nursing made for less humour or maybe just the status, or lack thereof, of nurses in that time made for less than interesting reading.  I felt that she was always stretching stories out to the point where they become rather boring.  The people she was working with and for were also simply not as amusing as the variety of people in whose homes she worked during the first novel.  All in all, this was a disappointment.	2002-02-28

It is the very simple story of a very unassuming daughter of Polish immigrants.  The mundanity of her life is what makes the book so appealing.  Having been raised by the most unbelievably cold and emotionless parents to lead a life totally devoid of any expectations, the heroine has finally found love and, she believes, a future that will be new, exciting and full of love.  But no, ... she is left at the alter by a man who chooses to become a priest rather than marry her.  The book tells both her love story and her attempt to sell her engagement ring - The Lite of Heaven.  Its an unusual book, a simple book but totally charming and a fascinating insight into the Polish-American experience mixed with a great deal of Catholic guilt.	2002-02-14

Libby is another one of those English girls who has a fun career in public relations, a nice circle of friends but feels her lovelife is lacking.  Two guys appear on the scene, worlds apart, and the story basically becomes about who she will choose.  Like too many women in real life, Libby's focus is on having a wedding as opposed to having a marriage, i.e. its all about &quot;the big day&quot;, rather than the reality of a lifelong commitment.  This is a well-written story, a fun read but expectations for something different in this genre of books should be limited.	2002-02-05

Accompanying her boyfriend to the States, she hits New York City like a whirlwind and injects more than a little money into the NY economy.  The plot of this book is, I think, quite a bit stronger than the first book with a little intrigue lurking in the background.  If you've ever enjoyed a good shopping spree in New York (or have ever dreamed of having one), you will love her exploits.  I read this book in a 24 hour period - I laughed and laughed and just couldn't get enough of it.	2002-02-03

It is a sensitive, funny and very moving tale.  It helps bring to light both how difficult life can be for those who suffer this disorder and how cruel and prejudiced people can be when confronted with something or somebody different to them.

The many characters and numerous plots twists and turns keep the reader engrossed throughout the almost 700 pages.  Written in 1997, the computer and internet technology described may have been somewhat complicated then, but today in 2002, is very easy to read and comprehend.  My one criticism is that, like many other authors today, Baldacci appeared to be writing this novel with a screenplay already in mind.  Yes, it would make a great movie - but I think he was making that assumption just a tad too early.	2002-01-27

This is a wonderfully crafted story which got better and better as it unfolded.  When Nathan takes his wife and four daughters to the Congo in the late 1950s to undertake missionary work, they have no real comprehension of what is in store for them.  There are some obvious obstacles that confront them and many that they cannot have envisioned.  After a major event occurs (which should not be revealed until the reader reaches that stage of the book), their family structure and future drastically changes and for me this heralded the most fascinating part of the book.  A great deal of cross-analysis with the Bible can be made, but don't let that deter you.  Even without a detailed knowledge of the Bible, the reader can still thoroughly enjoy this book and gain a great deal from it.  Having enjoyed The Poisonwood Bible so much, I will go on to Barbara Kingsolver's other works without hesitation.	2002-01-22

Wolf leaves no detail behind - she introduced a few things I had never heard of for weddings.  The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is that it really isn't a great piece of literature, but then again it doesn't pretend to be either.

The main character was so lacking in any kind of motivation, despite opportunities that were all around her, that she needed a good swift kick up the behind. The author had several potentially interesting scenarios but never adequately followed up on any of them.  The main character's drinking problem was never actually addressed and she was apparently still totally oblivious to it at the end of the book.  Attempts at humour fell flat and generally the book was dark and depressing.  A huge disappointment for me.	2002-01-22

And so she decides to try her hand at domestic service.  If you have ever enjoyed watching the wonderful &quot;Upstairs Downstairs&quot; series or reading other tales which reflect the upstairs downstairs lives of the British class system, this is for you.

Outlander is a big read - it is full of romance, adventure, magic and history.  When Claire is transported from mid 20th century Scotland back to the 1740s she is surrounded by a wild country, warring clansmen, heroes, villains and much more.  This book never slows down despite its length.  The author manages effortlessly to also transport the reader back to this adventurous and romantic time.  I think it would be hard for any reader not to be engulfed by the romance between Claire and the headstrong young Jamie Fraser.  However, be warned, it is not a gentle romanctic read full of swelling bosoms and hinted-at lovemaking.  This book is full of raw, untamed sex and somewhat graphic violence.

It is purely a fictional tale.  But it is a quite delightful fictional tale that I found to be a very pleasant and quite interesting read.  It is the story of an impoverished girl who is sent to be a lowly maid in the Vermeer household in the mid 1600s.  Her interaction with the master, whilst quite innocent, is a catalyst for suspicion and jealousy amongst other members of the household, both above and below stairs.  Much of her time is spent treading carefully as rumours of her relationship with Vermeer spread throughout the house and the entire town.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I am sure others will too so long as they don't try to make it into anything more serious.	2001-12-18

Gentle, loving Tara with her possessive, overbearing miser of a boyfriend - who frankly, you want to slap about the head; ice-queen Katherine in total control of her life - or so it seems; and Fintan the delightful gay friend battling the biggest fight of his life.  There are plenty of other characters to keep this book action-packed from beginning to end.  I have now read every book Marian Keyes has written and can't bear to think about how long I am going to have to wait for the next one - but you can bet your life, I'll get it hot off the press!	2001-12-02

I loved every single page of it this time around and I am sure that I understood it a great deal more than when I was a teenager.  This is a remarkably well-written book with humour, pathos and charm, besides its more obvious look at various types of prejudice.  The fact that the story is told through the eyes of a young girl gives it a wonderfully innocent appeal but constantly challenges the reader to look at its larger social issues.  Despite the fact that it is set in the 1930s, this classic has not aged at all.  If you have not read this book at all, get to it; if it has been many years since you have read it, have another look at it - you won't be disappointed.	2001-11-27

Like many readers a little tired of the &quot;lawyers in Mississippi&quot; theme, I was reluctant to tackle this book - but I was delightfully surprised and found this novel to be a charming read.  Told through the eyes of 7-year old Luke, the reader learns about the lives of poor cotton farmers in Arkansas in the early 1950s, their families and the people who work seasonly for them, i.e. the Mexicans and the hill people.  Grisham is, without doubt, an excellent writer.  Up until this book, I would have merely called him an excellent storyteller.  His characters are diverse, his descriptive passanges a pleasure to read and the storyline interesting enough to hold the reader.  I thoroughly recommend this book.	2001-11-20

This is a wonderfully lyric and poetic tale and is a must read for all lovers of Japan and Japanese culture/literature.  It tells the superb fictional tale of the real writer of the famous &quot;Tales of Genji&quot;.  It is a fascinating insight into the lives of 10th century Japanese women at court, looking at their daily lives, their place in society, their position in the family structure and much more.  If you have already read a great deal about Japan, this will give you even more insight.  If you have not read much about Japan, this would be a fabulous way to start.  I can't recommend this book highly enough.	2001-11-09

Lucy Sullivan and her mixed bag of friends consult a rather dubious fortune teller in an even more dubious part of London which leads them all to believe that within a year and half Lucy will be married.  Their exploits and adventures both in life and love are very entertaining and keep the reader immersed until the end - does Lucy get married? and if, so, to whom?

This very funny book is the story of Rachel, a journalist-turned-standup comic who is engaged to an extremely uptight dentist, whose ex-husband left her for a male Estee Lauder rep, whose 10 year old son has a bizarre passion for Barbra Streisand, whose employers are rather eccentric members of London's glitterati, whose mother appears to be having a fling with a toy boy ... well, anyway, she has lots going on in her life.

In a nutshell, it is the story of Melanie who has always lived in the shadow of beautiful, shallow, social-climbing Amanda who is about to marry (trap!) Fraser, a Scottish nobleman.  Melanie is surrounded by a diverse cast of characters - some of whom she would be better off without and others whom she doesn't welcome into her life as much as she should.  Just when I thought that the story line was getting a little predictable, the author totally surprised me and the further I got into the book, the better it became and resulted in a somewhat surprising but very good ending.	2001-10-20

This is a rather quirky novel fictiously set in the Coca Cola Company about the high-powered world of marketing.  This author would certainly have us believe that they only things more hyped up than the product being sold, are the hyped-up marketing executives themselves.  This is a funny, fast-paced book which was a pleasant change of pace from more traditional novels.  As someone who has never been directly involved in marketing, I have no idea whether or not it bears any resemblance to reality, but I do tend to suspect that the idea that the average consumer is a fool, is no doubt spot on.	2001-10-10

They have plenty of adventures along the way, largely due to the spur-of-the-moment decisions of the mother (whose motivation I never actually figured out), but to be honest, there simply was no real plot and no particular direction to the book.

This is a very well-written saga of two families who have grown up in the same small town where everybody knows everybody and their business too! Written through the narratives of 5 of the central characters we learn about their pasts and accompany them through their current travails. It is the stuff of good soap operas but so well written that it is a pleasure to read. I enjoyed this book more than &quot;Patty Jane's House of Curl&quot; (which I did enjoy very much).

If you are already a fan of his, you too will thoroughly enjoy this book.  For me the one reason why I didn't give it as much praise as his other books, is simply that I am not a hiker and would never in a million years undertake such a trip.  I loved his book on Australia because I am Australian, his books on small-town America because I have lived in small-town America, and his books on England and Europe because I have travelled extensively throughout both.

It is a funny, poignant and emotional story of a young woman's battle with drug and alcohol abuse.  It does not describe the seemier, down-in-the-gutter aspects of drug addiction that you may expect, but what can happen when &quot;social&quot; use of cocaine and other narcotics can quickly go out of control.  One minute you want to shake Rachel for her denial and then you want to hug her and take care of her because she is a genuinely good person who simply can't help herself.<br />I find Marian Keyes writing style to be so very readable and look forward to her new novel.	2001-09-11

But it is a very interesting and darkly comedic novel which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Switching backwards and forwards chapter to chapter, we are introduced to the young, impressionable Rosie living a somewhat shallow life amongst the London glitterati, and then we meet the more mature Rosie who has gone to Africa to work for an aid organisation in a refugee camp.  It is a very interesting look at how people and their priorities can change when faced with what they perceive to be important and what indeed really is.  My only criticism is that mid-way through the book, it became a little too entrenched in local African politics that did not need to be quite so detailed in order to set the stage for the reader.  Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed the book.	2001-08-20

But by the time I was halfway through the book, I was feeling too bombarded by both the very obvious analogies and symbiotic references to parasites and the somewhat ridiculous generalization of the French people as a whole.  But the time I was three-quarters of the way through I was literally scratching from reading about head lice (our heroine has by now left her husband and is living with a parasitologist who, along with many other characters, is totally one-dimensional and has no conversational skills outside the realm of bugs) and by the final chapters I found myself speed-reading in order to get it over and done with.<br />This could have been a good book but for me the author's style was somewhat stiff and uncomfortable.	2001-08-13

Having read and loved &quot;The Trials of Tiffany Trott&quot; I was eager to dive into &quot;Making Minty Malone&quot; - and I was not disappointed.  This is a very funny and touching book.  If you are one of millions of women who feel the need to be &quot;nice&quot; because you were raised to always be aware of other people's feelings, then you will relate to this tale.  Minty has always been too nice and too willing to bend to other people's wishes.  But when she is jilted in the middle of her wedding vows, this marks the beginning of a reincarnation for her.  It takes her a while to get over her fiance (we as the reader know full well why he is such a louse!) but when she pulls herself together and gets on with her life and career she really blossoms and takes full control.  This is one of those books where you really like the main character and want so much for her and I found it very hard to put down once I started it.  A really fun read.	2001-08-02

Yes, everyone in town has known her all her life and respects her as one of the town's  best known citizens (she is both the town pharmacist and on the Rescue Squad).  However, for reasons unknown to her, she has never felt as though she is truly a part of this community.  Her life has revolved around her work and the weekly visit by her beloved bookmobile.  But upon the death of her mother, Ave Maria starts to piece together some of the mystery surrounding her life and that of her family and she soons begins to believe that she needs to leave all that is familiar to her and to move on to somewhere else and start all over again.  Amidst this, Ave Maria is regarded as the town spinster - it is unthinkable to most of the townsfolk (most of whom have married as young as 15) that a woman could be unmarried at the grand old age of 35.<br />This book is well worth the time to find out just what it is that Ave Maria discovers about herself and her family and to accompany her on the path that she believes she must take.  It has some very amusing moments, especially those that surround the visit by Elizabeth Taylor and John Warner.  I look forward to reading the sequel, &quot;Big Cherry Holler&quot; some time soon.	2001-07-30

Its not exactly a novel; more an autobiography centred around southern traditions and cuisine.  For those raised in the deep south, I've no doubt it will bring back lots of happy memories and, for those of us not from those parts, its a wonderful insight into a place of steamy hot weather, fireflys and traditional home cooking passed down through generations (with some of those generations being somewhat eccentric!).

For some mistaken reason, I had thought that this book would be a comedy somewhat along the lines of the recent spate of Brit lit novels currently so popular.  But I was in for a surprise - and a very pleasant one at that.  This novel has 6 central characters, all of whom have secret desires which they, for varying reasons, are unable to be open and honest about and consequently spend a great deal of the book in and out of the wrong beds.  This has all the drama of a first class soap opera which I found amazingly gripping and I found it hard to put down - in fact, I read it in less than a day.  It would make a great movie and I wouldn't be surprised if there was already a plan to make one.  All in all, an exciting read.	2001-07-16

However, she does have her ups and downs over the next few months as she seeks refuge in the home of her parents and younger sisters back in Dublin.  Obviously Claire has enough on her plate to contend with, but her incredibly selfish and incompatable family would be enough to send most people over the rails anyway, regardless of whatever problems they were already dealing with.  Then just as she seems to be doing quite well, her husband turns up in Ireland and starts throwing more spanners into the works.<br />This is quite a journey for a 29 year old woman with a brand new baby and is one well worth reading.  It is very funny but also very touching and was a real page turner for me.  This is my first Marian Keyes novel but I have already ordered her other books and look forward to getting stuck into them too.	2001-07-14

The harder Tiffany tries to land herself a man, the worse off she seems to be.  But she perseveres in her search and is thoroughly entertaining to the reader all the way.

This is a beautifully crafted, magical journey to another world that whips up the imagination and leaves you begging for more.

Kate's family have a hard time dealing with the fact that a year after the death of her husband (who we learn has been far from the ideal spouse) she is out and about socially, has discovered a talent which she can translate into a profitable business, decides to move house and meets and falls in love with a wonderful man who can fill all the emptiness that is inside her.

It touches on two very serious subjects - coping with the death of a loved one and domestic violence.  When the latter subject arose late in the book, it struck me like a brick wall - but the author dealt with the violence in a brutally honest way which managed somehow to not detract from the overall wit and humour of the novel as a whole.

As an Australian, it was wonderful for me to see so clearly how our historic ties with Britain shaped our nation and our psyches, both positively and negatively.  But this is not just a book for Australians.  Many of my American friends have thoroughly enjoyed this book too.  Ker-Conway's writing is fluid and poetic and is a sheer pleasure to read.	2001-05-14

I am definitely looking forward to reading the next two volumes.<br />There are lots of characters and I did have to refer many times to the family tree at the front of the novel but all of these characters help to really set the stage for understanding the life and times of upper class English families who still bore the scars of the First World War and who are now gearing up for the inevitable return to the battlefields.<br />One facet of the book which fascinated me was how much time was devoted to the preparation of and eating of enormous quantities of food.  When one looks at how many meals were eaten daily, at how rich or loaded with sugar these meals were, one is amazed that the English were not a race of totally obese, diabetic people!<br />If you enjoy historical English family sagas, I think you will thoroughly enjoy this book.  I hope the next two volumes live up to my expectations.	2001-05-06

I wish I could give this book more than 5 stars.  It is an absolutely gorgeous book for anybody interested in table settings of the most elegant kind.  As well as spectacular photography of the most sumptuous crystal and china, the text is fascinating as it explains the history of table settings and of individual antiques.<br />As a person who is particularly interested in mixing and matching colored crystal and different china patterns on the table, I have found it to be of immense help and has given me even more courage to blend different styles together.<br />I will treasure this book forever.	2001-04-18
US	47153417	R1UWJ7OXMXKIHT	068483751X	42520803	An Actual Life	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	A Sad but Insightful Novel	This should be compulsory reading for all young girls/women who live by the belief that marriage is the be-all and end-all of what a woman can achieve and that, once married, life will be a fairy tale.  This book is the tragic tale of two young people in 1960 who marry because of an unplanned pregnancy and the inevitably bad marriage that follows.  These two barely know each other, have nothing in common, come from different backgrounds and are basically doomed.  My heart bled for both of them.  I am glad that times have changed and that shotgun weddings are largely a thing of the past.<br />This book is a charming story of innocence in a different time and I can highly recommend it to women of all ages.	2001-04-18

I admit to reading this book purely because it was this month's piece for my Book Club but, unlike most of the others in my group, I did not find it difficult to follow the six separate stories.  As a matter of fact, the less you worry about who each and every character in the book is, the easier it is to simply glide along and learn or re-learn the basics of the Revolution from a purely historical standpoint.  For the most part, it simply doesn't matter which of the characters' chapters you are currently in - the basic timeline of history continues to unfold.  I'm glad that I read the book and I did find it interesting but I can't go out of my way to recommend it.	2001-04-18

Like many people I am often sceptical about sequels, whether it be books or movies.  But Helen Fielding has written a funny and poignant book that had me in stitches and I was unable to put it down.  Its almost 12 years since I have been out there in &quot;singletondom&quot;, but reading this book made me feel like it was just last week.  Bravo!	2001-04-01

Yes, it is a very well-crafted piece of literature which, to be honest, I couldn't put down.  However, the level of dysfunction which permeates the story is profoundly disturbing.<br />Despite the horrors of their situation, I felt deeply for Harley and his sisters; I wanted them to break the cycle of abuse and misplaced love which had obviously had a stranglehold on their family for generations.  Despite the fact that the further I got into the book the more depressed I became, I had to see it through to the end and literally could not put it down.<br />I would comment that the professional reviewers (e.g. the Chicago Sun-Times) who describe the book as &quot;funny&quot;, are not only off the mark but they are offensive to me.  There is absolutely nothing funny about the themes portrayed in this complex and disturbing story.	2001-03-26

I equally enjoyed reading the stories of famous women vs. unknown women.  I especially enjoyed the 'chick' lists of books, music and movies that all women should at one time or another check out.	2001-03-20

My only negative comment (and this is from a purely personal perspective) is that it contains more casual table settings than formal, the latter being what I was actually looking for when I purchased the book.  But I am still very glad that I did.	2001-03-12

One one level it may seem to be somewhat simplistic and a quick and easy read.  However, the skilful and artistic author has in fact written a deep and emotionally moving novel about the depression-era childhood of a fatherless boy under the care and guidance of his mother and three uncles.  I confess to reading this only because it was the featured novel at my book club this month, but am so very glad that I did.  I found it fascinating to see how Jim's uncles guided him through life's sometimes hard-learned lessons with both toughness and compassion.  I look forward to my group's discussion later this week.	2001-03-12

She is an absolute hoot who gets her revenge on her skin-flint husband after years of his domination.  I'm not saying that this is the greatest piece of literature ever written, but I so enjoyed this story and all the characters in it, that I just wish that there were more Ann B. Ross books available for me to turn to next.  Here's to you, Miss Julia!	2001-03-10

I did like the characters and how they developed but felt that the story itself plodded along and that the romance between the main characters was perhaps a little too chaste for this day and age.	2001-02-28

This was the third of Michael Lee West's books which I have read (and I am eagerly awaiting the soon-to-be-published &quot;Mad Girls in Love&quot;).  How three sisters with the same upbringing can be so totally different provides a groundwork for a book that is both tragic and funny and witty.  Ms West's usual backdrop of southern food and cooking makes one salivate throughout.  Despite the most unlikely sequence of events that befalls this family, the sisters' ultimate survival left me finishing this book with a huge smile on my face.	2001-02-22

It is a superbly written piece that it going to keep me pondering and thinking for weeks to come.  A tragic tale of a family's elevated perception of itself and its inability to deal with any event that strays from the ordinary.  I am sure that if I read this again in a few year's time, I will find even more within its pages.	2001-02-16

To me, a great deal of what Jo clings to is not what happened in her past but of what she feels she missed out on from her past.  Her difficult relationship with her daughters stems from the opportunities they are seizing in their youth but which she did not seize upon, despite opportunity, when she was &quot;away&quot;.  I admit that the ending was not quite as dramatic as I anticipated it to be, but in retrospect, some of the potential endings I was envisioning would have probably been too melodramatic.  Sue Miller instead takes Jo to a place in her life where she finally accepts and appreciates the life and family she has.	2001-02-03

In some respects it reminded me (in a style sense) of &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; by Andre Dubus III - a simple story of simple people set on a course of inevitable drama and potential destruction.  Lots of family and individual secrets emerge as you delve further and further into this book.  For me, it was a real page turner.	2001-01-08

Rather than finding a group of lovable southern belles, I found a group of loud-mouthed, vulgar trailer trash.  Yes, it had its moments but not enough for me to bother with the next book in this series.  Looking back, I guess I misinterpreted the reviews.  My mistake.	2001-01-08

For anyone who has spent extended periods of times (i.e. years) out of the States, this is compulsory reading.  His observations of daily American life versus life in other parts of the world are spot-on.<br />For me, his most fascinating and true observation was that when you are an expatriate living away from your own country you feel an amazing sense of your own nationality and tend to wear it openly on your sleeve, but once you return to your own country after years away, you realise that you have lost so much of your original identity.  Its probably been replaced by something much more worldly and possibly meaningful, but inevitably you are forced to admit that you have changed even more than the changes that have occured in your own culture during your absence.<br />I look forward to reading your next one, Bill.	2001-01-04

From Joline Newhouse and her dark secrets, to Georgia Rose and her hidden powers, and to Martha Rasnick and the stranger she kept hidden in her garage, Ms Smith kept me entertained.  But for the very reason that I am not a fan of short stories, I felt cheated by the time each story ended.  Just as I grew to know each new character and to be baited with each new plot, it was over.  In every story, Ms Smith has the groundwork to write an entire book - complete with plots full of potential and a cast of new and diverse characters.  I have read several of her novels and look forward to reading those I have not managed to get to yet, but I'm simply not into short stories.<br />If you are a fan of short stories and a fan of fiction set in the Deep South, then I do recommend &quot;Cakewalk&quot;.  But if you are like me and like to really settle in for a while with a novel, then try one of Lee Smith's full-length works instead.	2000-12-27
