Although I know that is the formula V.C. uses I still don't like it much.  You become so attached to the Heaven in the first  three books that changing point of view to the daughter's side is kinda  weird.  I have to admit that in the Cutler series when the same thing  happened in the fourth book I enjoyed much more.  I think the only reason I  didn't enjoy this one as much was because there wasn't much action.  And  all the mysteries in the book you already new the answers from the previous  books.  It was fun though to see your old favorite characeters progress.   Like Aunt Fanny wasn't so immature anymore and Tony Tatterton really was a  sick demented guy.  I have to admit I always felt a little sorry for Tony  in the past few books but not in this one.  Definitely read it if you are  intrested in the Casteel family saga but the first three Heaven books are  much better.	2000-07-06

People thinking it was hard to get into this book.  I found it harder to get into the other three books and very quickly I fell into this book.  I thought the story of  Tenar was very exciting.  I loved the dark undergound Labyrinth.  It just  became better as Gehn made his first appearence.  I was completely drawn  into this book and was disappointed to see that Tenar was only mentioned  vaguely in the third novel.  I believe the Tombs of Atuan was the best  Earthsea book of them all.	2000-06-03

This story was absolutely amazing.  Many times I put the book down in wonderment, realizing this was a true story.  That this was real.  Nancy's story is a helpful resource to any teen who has to face a scary disease.   Nancy lends you hope when the world looks bleak.  She tried to be so happy  in her short troubled life.  This book is very much a tearjerker but an  excellent one at that.  Nancy's diary makes you think and most teen books  out there today don't deliver that.  Nancy's heartbreaking story is  something everyone should read and hold close to your heart.	2000-06-03

SVU thriller editions are pretty cool because they usually show the story from a character besides the twins point of view.  It was one of the best SVU Thriller Editions but you sort of know who the killer is after awhile  but a lot of SVU thriller are like that.  So if your a true Sweet Valley  (like me!) you'll love but if not you will probably think it is just okay!	1999-12-10

I loved this book this was the third Sweet Valley book to make me cry.  Olivia's death was so sad and at her funeral everyone said such wonderful things about her.  For all the other people who wrote reviews and were  wondering why Olivia becomes reincarnated I think I have an answer for you.   SVU #8 was written almost four years before SVH Eathquake and Aftershock.   Obviously Francine Pascals had not yet decided to kill off Olivia so she  wasn't dead.  There are a lot of descrepencies between the series.  You  really have to read SVH and SVU as if they weren't even related.  Or else  you'll go out of your mind.  So I agree Francine Pascals should keep better  track of her characters but it wouldn't really be Sweet Valley with people  coming back to life every now and again now would it?  (Hint William White,  Nicholas Marin, Christian Gorman, and now Olivia Davidson.)  This two part  mini series was the perfect way to end Sweet Valley High the Senior Year is  even better.  As long as I can read about the twins I will pleased.  Long  live Sweet Valley in any shape size or form! And a little ghost every now  and then isn't gonna bother me!	1999-12-08

At first I was a little disappointed that this story wouldn't be told in Dawn's perespective but I did become very ataached to Christie.  This was a very sood sequel to the other three books.  The Cutler series is amazing.   I can't wait to read The Darkest Houur and find out how the Cutler family  got such a curse laid down on them.  If you are intrested in this book at  all be sure to read Dawn, Secrets of the Morning, and Twilight's Child  first so it will make sense!	1999-08-19

There were many new revelations and many deaths and unhappiness.  I'm rather disappointed that the next book will be told by Christie's point of view  rather than Dawn's I've become rather attached to Dawn!  Oh well!  At the  very end of the story I felt my first course of sympathy to Grandmother  Cutler.  The whole story has the perfect ending!  I love V.C. Andrews books  so much!  They are twisted and evil.  Yet at the same time they are  marvelous and wonderful! Be sure to read The entire Cutler series I'm sure  that the other ons will be just as good as the first three!	1999-08-14

I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that V.C. books are very similar.  But hey don't mess with success right!  I loved the whole Sutton affair very dramatic and romantic!   This whole book was just masterfully written it had so many different  elements to tie you in!  The only thing that bothered me was this,  did any  of you guys notice that they spelled the school's name two different ways  throughout the book, Bernhart and Bernhardt! A little weird but a little  typo like that is worth overlooking for this masterful tale!  Make sure you  read Dawn first though!	1999-08-12

So I was surprised at the suicide ending.  I found that very amazing to the complex of this character.  The only two disappointments were that Robert and Edna never really got up together  sexually and that Edna didn't think more of her children.  She thinks about  them for five seconds and then didmisses them out of her mind.  I wouldn't  call her the first femnist more like another selfish sexually deprived  snobby rich girl.  But the story was well constructed.  I think critics  weighed it differently than it actually apears on the written pages.	1999-06-24

As a reader of both the above mentioned series I can assure you there is not even a trace  of Stine in these Orphan series.  I like it that way to because if I wanted  to read Stine Then I would buy Stine. Brooke, is a wonderfully written story.  I can't wait to continue on with  this series which is totally unlike any Fear Street book I have ever read.   So read this book if you want a nice intresting story to read.  It is a little similar to the first book Butterfly but they were both good so  don't mess with success right!  Besides Brooke was much more head strong  than Butterfly so eventhough there circumstances were similar there  seperate personalities caused different outcomes in the stories.  So in  conclusion read Brooke and enjoy it!	1999-06-13

It was much better than his usual books like the ones in the fear street series because it is believable no weird supernatural things that couldn't really happen and plus it shows how the  main character grows in the end when she calls shep. she realizes in some  wat she grown up.  or come back from the dead.  She realizes what a snobby  brat she has been.  so instead of just a slash them up kind of thing this  Stine book actually has a moral.  i liked that fact that it had a moral but  was still scary and gross the rest of the time!!!	1999-06-09
